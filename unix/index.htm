Lyle McElhaney began the Unix 'Security Mailing List' in late 1984
after discussions on Usenet.
The first (1) issue was dated 18th December 1984, and issues continued 
until Andrew Burt took over ownership with the twenty-fifth (25) issue 
on 11th March 1987. Andrew continued ownership until the forty-second 
(42) issue on 13th May 1989.
The list initially operated out of an ARPANET UUCP node at 'denelcor'
(a super-computer manufacturer in Aurora, Colorado, USA), but later
moved to 'cisden'.
The nature of the list can be described as sporadic and haphazard,
but largely revolved around early 4.2 and 4.3 BSD UNIX issues of privilege
violations, file permissions, scripts, passwords, uu programs, and early
networking.
Many of the participants are well known in the computer security community,
including Robert T. Morris, Len Rose, Gene Spafford, John Gilmore, 
Theodore Ts'o and Matt Bishop.
Neil Gorsuch was also a reader, and the Zardoz 'Security Digest'
can be seen as being a splinter from the list. The USENET groups of
alt.security and comp.security.misc grew out of discussions about
the list and the doctrine of disclosure.
An approximate count shows the list having about 452 readers, and 138 
posters, for a total of 254 messages in 42 digests, comprising 18506 
lines and 679 kilobytes.

<p>

</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Beginning</span>
</p>

<p>
In 1983, net.unix-wizards was, amongst other newsgroups,
a key discussion forum for the UNIX community that congregated 
around USENET.
Although the idea 
of a security mailing list had been discussed before 
[<a href="#USENET-1983-06-19">USENET-1983-06-19</a>],
it was a posting by Lyle McElhaney on the 7th December 1984 
[<a href="#USENET-1984-12-07">USENET-1984-12-07</a>]
that ultimately resulted in the creation of the Unix
'Security Mailing List'.
</p>

<p>
Lyle's post outlines the nature of the proposed list: it was to
provide a semi-public forum between those with administrative
responsibility. There was some understanding about the relative
insecurity of the mailing list itself, and a subsequent post by
Lyle 
[<a href="#USENET-1984-12-08">USENET-1984-12-08</a>]
discussed the possible use of crypt(1) as a
means of protection, but with export control issues.
One respondent pointed out the 'more severe' problem about not
knowing whether those on the list were 'good guys or bad', while the
other seven respondents went off onto a tangent about the use of
crypt(3) and passwords. 
</p>

<p>
There was no other public discussion until a post by Lyle 
on the 22nd December 1984 
[<a href="#USENET-1984-12-22">USENET-1984-12-22</a>]
announcing the creation of
the list, with 65 initial members. It was decided not to encrypt
the list, and Lyle was canvassing the opinion of UUCP sites through
which the list would be distributed - asking if those sa's (system
administrators) had any concerns about such a list passing through
them, with the potential for the list to leak to other users.
</p>

<p>
The list also had an address: '...denelcor!sec-request'.
</p>

<p>
Less publicly, there had been a first mailing of the list on the
18th December 1984 
[<a href="#ARCHIVE-001">ARCHIVE-001</a>].
This first mailing discussed the outstanding questions
of validation and distribution. Lyle resolves
this through the opinion of others, representing both sides of 
the open and closed spectrum. He proposes that 'anyone can receive
the list, but they must be recommended by a major node's root 
user'. The distribution issue is resolved with the suggestion
to 'lean toward the lazy side: let the "security" inherent in mail
itself protect the data'. 
</p>

<p>
Lyle recalls the time today: 'There was a lot of e-mail going around
about breakins (generally students in
academic settings, but a few other as well), and some controversy about who
should be alerted about it - admins or everyone.  Like now, lots of machines
(in academia and in businesses) on the net were vanilla "right out of the
box" setups, and no one patched them except under extreme duress.   I
couldn't find out what I needed to know, so I decided to start the list and
worry the distribution problem as we went along.'
</p>

<p>
As for Lyle himself, his background was in software. He'd worked 
with Martin-Marietta (now Martin-Lockheed) before coming to Denelcor, 
a then Colorado based manufacturer of super-computers. 
At Denelcor, just running
USENET and external e-mail was 'extra-curricular', let alone a
security mailing list. Although he didn't try to hide it, he doubts
that anyone else at Denelcor knew about the list. The need for 
security at Denelcor was limited to patching UNIX machines, and 
'trying to keep ahead of the kids in the summer'.
</p>

<p>
At the time, computer security was in its infancy. As Lyle says,
'viruses were unknown, and worms were just a science-fiction item',
although 'there was some concern about what [...] the remote variety
of commands could do, but you still had to be on the local net to
use them, and that meant inside our building'. Denelcor's
HEP machines were UNIX based, and 'designed to be use [sic] in
the national labs and NSA': places where 'security
was physical', and 'the full implications of networking weren't
understood'. Although Lyle was interested in resolving security
issues as part of his administrative role, there didn't seem to
be any specific concern for security in the production systems.
</p>

<p>
For Lyle, security wasn't a burning passion: not something to
focus on as a career, or particular hobby or interest: 
he says, '"Security" was not a CS discipline that you
could be an "expert" in': 'there was no theoretical basis
for security back then; only a few concrete tactical things
could be done'. His
act of goodwill at the time was to do something about a problem in the 
community
that affected him. Lyle says that the list gave him, as the lead
systems administrator, 'some of the
clues [he] needed to patch up [Denelcor] systems', and 'that
was what [he] needed [the list] for in the first place'.
</p>

<p>
Apart from the list, his involvement in security work was about 
average for someone with long service in the field of technology: 
the occasional project every
now and then. His views have moderated
with time, and while, in his own words, he 'apparently thought
at the time that full disclosure was the way to go', he is 
'not sure that [he] would say the same thing now'.
</p>

<p>
On the 5th January 1985, Lyle made an 'official' announcement
to USENET 
[<a href="#USENET-1985-01-05">USENET-1985-01-05</a>]
with a leader: 'State of the list: Security mail list about
to start'. He described the intervening discussion about the security
of the list itself, and the protocol for parties that wanted to join.
Again, he stressed the need for any concerned 'sa's to speak
up if they have issues with the sensitive material on the list
passing through their UUCP hosts. Lyle's was applying the
appropriate level of diligence.
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Operating</span>
</p>

<p>
The list's first 'real edition' went out on the wires on the 6th
January 1985
[<a href="#ARCHIVE-002">ARCHIVE-002</a>], with '42 people
on the list right now', and
about 65 yet to be approved. Famously, the first posting to the list
is from Robert T. Morris (then at Harvard) with a short request 
for 'software which maintains lists of permissable modes (or
paradigms for determining reasonable ones) and perhaps checksums
for files and periodically traverses the file hierarchy looking
for changes'. The list was off to an auspicious start, even if the
none of the participants were aware.
</p>

<p>
The third edition went out within a fortnight on 18th January 1985 
[<a href="#ARCHIVE-003">ARCHIVE-003</a>],
with a reply to Robert T. Morris's question from Matt Bishop, describing
a system that Purdue University had in place for periodically
verifying correct permissions on files. Two other posts in this
edition included details of exploits. Although early traffic was 
good, the eighth edition on 6th March 1985 
[<a href="#ARCHIVE-008">ARCHIVE-008</a>]
asked whether the
list was 'out of topics, or is [the editors] mail getting fouled up
again?'. 
</p>

<p>
According to a USENET post at the time
[<a href="#USENET-1985-03-07">USENET-1985-03-07</a>], this
is quite possible: Georgia Tech had been having problems reaching 
the list for several weeks. Another poster reported similar
connectivity problems 
[<a href="#USENET-1985-03-08">USENET-1985-03-08</a>],
including what looked like
local site mis-configuration on denelcor. UUCP was not the most
reliable delivery medium.
</p>

<p>
Regardless, conversation did recover and continue at a reasonable level with
topics including 4.2 and 4.3 BSD UNIX bugs, patches and exploits; 
issues with uu*, sendmail, and ftp; and discussion about the nature of
the list and disclosure of security issues. Most new editions also
contained a list of new recipients, and membership was increasing at a
respectable rate.
</p>

<p>
During this period, the list made its way into the 'Publicly accessible 
mailing lists',
posted to USENET on 12th August 1985 [<a href="#USENET-1985-08-12">USENET-1985-08-12</a>].
This described
the list as having 'discussion and comment (and sometimes bug
fixes) which touch on the security aspects of the UNIX operating
system' and membership would be granted by discretion.
</p>

<p>
The first sign of change came with a posting to USENET by Lyle
on 11th September 1985 [<a href="#USENET-1985-09-11">USENET-1985-09-11</a>], indicating that the 
mailing list 'is alive and well, although it's host is not', and the
list was being 'moved to another system'. One other respondent
in the thread, a Michael C. Berch, asked whether this was 'the
same list as exists on ARPA that is remailed via Rutgers?'. It
wasn't, that was another list being run by The Hobbit.
</p>

<p>
Within a week, the 21st edition arrived on 16th September
1985 [<a href="#ARCHIVE-021">ARCHIVE-021</a>], comforting recipients with the message that 'the Security
Mailing List is alive and well in spite of troubles at Denelcor and
that the list has a new address', as '...!cisden!sec-request'. Lyle
had moved to ConTel Information Systems. This edition was short: one
article from over a month ago. 
</p>

<p>
The list was again silent for some time. A poster to USENET on 17th December 1985
asked whether it was 'still in existance?' [<a href="#USENET-1985-12-17">USENET-1985-12-17</a>]. There was
no reply to this. Lyle responded to related thread on 1st January
1986 [<a href="#USENET-1986-01-12">USENET-1986-01-12</a>] with the message that 'unfortunately I now have
to work for a living, since I'm no longer an SA', and that since 
'the last one that [he] was able to send from Denelcor before the plug
got pulled', he had 'received only one article for the list', and he
thought 'most everything concerning security had been said, although
4.3 hadn't yet arrived...'. 
</p>

<p>
Months later, on 13th March 1986, Lyle was posting to USENET [<a href="#USENET-1986-03-13">USENET-1986-03-13</a>]
asking for help from 'sendmail fans', as he was 'supposed to be [...] running
a mailing list for UNIX security matters', and 'trying to get the list
back up, and [was] having trouble using sendmail'. Other details in the post
revealed that there were some 260
recipients, and the problem was that copies were being exploding to all recipients
on the local machine and delivered independently, rather than being forked by
downstream nodes.
</p>

<p>
Despite this, the list remained silent until the 22nd edition arrived on
11th May 1986 [<a href="#ARCHIVE-022">ARCHIVE-022</a>], containing a profuse apology for the excruciating
delay. Lyle indicated that he needed to re-verify the 'about 250 addresses,
including several generic aliases', and work on a backlog of some
'120 requests to join the mailing list'. Some articles had been lost
in the gap, and the only available one was a notification of vulnerability
in Sun Unix 3.0 FCS, by one 'John Gilmore'. USENET was, at the time, not a
large community, and many well known individuals in the technology community
are found participating back in the day.
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Changing</span>
</p>

<p>
The list returned to silence, until a post to USENET on 27th February 1987
[<a href="#USENET-1987-02-27">USENET-1987-02-27</a>] announcing that Andrew Burt had 'taken over administration
of the Unix Security Mailing List from Lyle McElhaney and [was] officially
announcing its rebirth'. This was long post, outlining concerns about
stagnation on the list, the membership rules (with a pro-forma
membership form), the location of archives, and how to make submissions.
</p>

<p>
Soon, a repost of the 23rd edition 
went came out on 11th March 1987 [<a href="#ARCHIVE-023">ARCHIVE-023</a>], 
with the new administrator announcing that he didn't 'know
what happened to Lyle's distribution near the end', and that he needed to 
re-send the 23rd and 24th editions, with the 'first NEW issue' being
the 26th. 
</p>

<p>
The 25th issue on 11th March 1987 [<a href="#ARCHIVE-025">ARCHIVE-025</a>] revealed all, starting with:
</p>

<p>
''This note is to inform you of the rebirth of the Unix Security Mailing List.''<br>
''I am mailing this out to all the members currently on the list, of which
about half are new members.  The purpose of this note is for the other half:
to let you know what's going on.''<br>
''I, Andrew Burt, have taken over administration of the list from Lyle McElhaney.
He was overworked at his last sight (cisden) and hadn't done anything with the
list for about a year.  He then left the company and couldn't take the list
with him.  I volunteered to take it because I think it's too important a
list to let die like that.''
</p>

<p>
The announcement went on to discuss the rebirth of the list, and some of Andrew's
background.
</p>

<p>
The 26th edition on 21 March 1987 [<a href="#ARCHIVE-026">ARCHIVE-026</a>] was acknowledged as the 'first "real"
issue since [Andrew Burt had] taken over the list', and came with the entire
membership list. Andrew said that he would use the 'next two issues' to 
post the source code of programs by Pat Wood, from the 'Unix System Security'
book. He acknowledged concerns that people had about the 'security of the
list itself', and described his approach to validation, and his belief
that 'encrypting the list' isn't 'worth the slight edge it gives'. This
edition contained ample new traffic, including a breakin report.
</p>

<p>
The 27th and 28th editions on 1st April 1987 
[<a href="#ARCHIVE-027">ARCHIVE-027</a>] 
[<a href="#ARCHIVE-028">ARCHIVE-028</a>], carried the 
code for the security analysis program by Pat Wood: Andrew Burt was putting the
pieces of the list back together again, and it seemed to be working.
</p>

<p>
The 29th edition [<a href="#ARCHIVE-029">ARCHIVE-029</a>] contained avid discussion on IFS, login scripts,
uu problems, Ethernet problems, and an announcement of the forthcoming 
'crypt-breaker's workbench'. The traffic here does show a slightly different
character to that of a few years before: there are more networking related
issues.
</p>

<p>
The 30th edition on 24th April 1987 [<a href="#ARCHIVE-030">ARCHIVE-030</a>], and the 31st edition on
9th May 1987 [<a href="#ARCHIVE-031">ARCHIVE-031</a>] demonstrated a revived interest in the list, even
if there are duplicates in the editions. But mailing problems
continued, and were reported in the 32nd edition on 2nd June 1987 [<a href="#ARCHIVE-032">ARCHIVE-032</a>],
although the edition contained lively discussion and good code. 
</p>

<p>
Around this time, Andrew Burt could be found 
discussing 'Passwords'
and 'thefts' in a mailing to comp-risks on 19th May 1987 [<a href="#USENET-1987-05-19">USENET-1987-05-19</a>].
Speaking in the
position of 'administrator of the Unix security mailing list', he welcomed
system administrators 'to join the USML'. He seemed to be taking an interest
in the community, but otherwise the list was not mentioned on USENET for
the remainder of 1987. 
</p>

<p>
While the 33rd edition
[<a href="#ARCHIVE-033">ARCHIVE-033</a>]
worked, the 
34th edition
[<a href="#ARCHIVE-034">ARCHIVE-034</a>]
demonstrated
that mailing problems continued to plague the list. There are no dates on
these editions, but the submissions range from late March to the 19th
April 1987.
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Reviving</span>
</p>

<p>
A posting to USENET on 11th October 1988 [<a href="#USENET-1988-10-11">USENET-1988-10-11</a>], well over a year 
since the last edition, asks 'when the security list will be "active" again',
suggesting that if the 'list is going to be out of service for a while,
perhaps it is time to start another list somewhere?'. Matt Crawford
responded to this on 14th October 1988 [<a href="#USENET-1988-10-14">USENET-1988-10-14</a>] suggesting that there
are multiple tasks required in reviving the list, and that he'd be 'willing
to volunteer' for some of these. Neil Gorsuch also replied to this thread
on 22nd October 1988 [<a href="#USENET-1988-10-22">USENET-1988-10-22</a>] indicating that he 'was willing to host
the security mailing list'. Neil also provided eleven detailed points about how the
new list would be run. Three days later, on 25th October 1988, another posting
to this thread by Neil [<a href="#USENET-1988-10-25">USENET-1988-10-25</a>] made it clear that a new was underway:
'In the first 3 days, 13 members have been added to the new security
mailing list'. 
</p>

<p>
Andrew Burt announced to USENET on 27th October 1988 [<a href="#USENET-1988-10-27">USENET-1988-10-27</a>] that
the list was subject to many operational problems, and he 'felt pangs
of guilt about not getting the list back sooner'. The rest of the long
posting described some changes to the operation of the list before it
would be revived. He requested 'a few days to coordinate sites ...' 
before announcing 'new procedures for signing up'. Neil Gorsuch replied
to the thread with details of the new list that had been created at 'zardoz'.
</p>

<p>
Interestingly, a posting to USENET on 30th October 1988 [<a href="#USENET-1988-10-30">USENET-1988-10-30</a>]
mentioned 'the discussion in news.sysadmin', but specifically
concerned itself with 'the larger issue of whether closed mailing
lists or open forums are more appropriate for discussion of security
matters'. The author, Michael C. Berch, proposed the provisional
creation of 'alt.security' and the need for discussion on the creation
of an 'unmoderated and unrestricted' 'comp.security' : a number of 
respondents to this thread discussed the idea. Neil Gorsuch's later 
post to this thread on 18th November 1988 [<a href="#USENET-1988-11-18">USENET-1988-11-18</a>] made it clear
that the splinter 'zardoz' mailing list had '153 mailing destinations'
with 'approximately 70 requests waiting'.
</p>

<p>
The timing of this discussion cannot be understated. On the 2nd 
November 1988, the Robert T. Morris Worm 'escaped' into the ARPANET,
infecting many hosts, and in the course of doing so, escalating the
path of computer security, and earning itself a place in history.
</p>

<p>
There had obviously been considerable debate over the resumption and
nature of the security list, which would have been fanned by
the Worm incident. Andrew Burt's posting
to USENET on 6th November 1988 [<a href="#USENET-1988-11-06">USENET-1988-11-06</a>] outlined several issues
about revival of the list, including justification for having a
'closed' list. Andrew acknowledges the validity of 
'(alt|comp).unix.security' but proposes to continue running the list
as closed, feeling that it serves a purpose. Rahul Dhesi's reply
to this on 7th November 1988 [<a href="#USENET-1988-11-07">USENET-1988-11-07</a>] sniped that 'ironically
enough, even as this discussion continues, thousands of machines
are bitten by a simple security hole in sendmail that could have 
been fixed *had it been widely publicized*'. In another thread
on 14th November 1988 [<a href="#USENET-1988-11-14">USENET-1988-11-14</a>], John Nagle 'suggest[ed] that
the security mailing list be posted to a newsgroup, but with a 60-day
delay'.
</p>

<p>
The 35th edition [<a href="#ARCHIVE-035">ARCHIVE-035</a>] finally arrived, 
with only an editorial:
an apology for 'The Great Hiatus', and a summary of the operation
of the list with an acknowledgement that Neil Gorsuch's list had started
in the meantime. The intervening period had also seen the Robert T. Morris
Worm, and the birth of the phage list. Andrew rebuts some criticism that the
list was being restarted as a result of the Worm incident: the October 
1988 postings to USENET easily confirm that the restart had begun before
the Worm incident, but only by weeks.  In fact, one could speculate that there is
a causal chain from the USENET discussions to the Worm, rather than vice
versa - but Robert T. Morris denies the connection.
</p>

<p>
It's with the 36th edition [<a href="#ARCHIVE-036">ARCHIVE-036</a>] that dates of 11th November 1988 are 
apparent on submissions. In it, Andrew Burt describes the idea of posting 
a 'complete' archive of the phage list, indicating that 'for those who
don't know, the phage list is the emergency list Gene Spafford set up
when the worm problem started'. 
</p>

<p>
The 37th edition in December 1988 [<a href="#ARCHIVE-037">ARCHIVE-037</a>] contained much discussion,
and a number of issues related to the Worm incident, including a copy of 
Bob Page's 'A REPORT ON THE INTERNET WORM'. While the archive itself is
undated, all
submissions in this edition have dates in the last half of November
1988. 
</p>

<p>
The 38th edition in December 1988 [<a href="#ARCHIVE-038">ARCHIVE-038</a>] shows the hallmarks of an
increasing maturity in discussion on computer security. The security
of tftp is discussed, there's a submission by Gene Spafford to
advertise his Internet Worm tech report, a copy of a DDN FTP security
public was forwarded, Russell Brand announces that 'Arpa is in the
process of extrablishing (sic) a computer security emergency reponse
(sic) team', another sendmail bug was found, and the philosophy of a
security list continues to the talked about. These are different in nature
to those from the early days of the list.
</p>

<p>
On 3rd December 1988, a posting to USENET by The Hobbit [<a href="#USENET-1988-12-03">USENET-1988-12-03</a>]
announces that 'The Security List is back', outlining the reasons
for the long vacation, and the intervening 'RTM virus uproar', but 
making it clear that 'this is *not* the "unix security mailing list"',
which 'is a separate entity run by Andrew Burt' that 'deals exclusively
with unix security problems', where 'membership is restricted in a
number of ways'. The Hobbit acknowledges that the Worm incident was an
impetus to restart his list.
</p>

<p>
It was on the 8th December 1988 that Andrew Burt announced to USENET
[<a href="#USENET-1988-12-08">USENET-1988-12-08</a>] the 'official procedures for joining the "secure" Unix
security mailing list (the old one that has awoken again).'.
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Ending</span>
</p>

<p>
The 39th edition on 19th January 1989 [<a href="#ARCHIVE-039">ARCHIVE-039</a>] is followed a long time
later by the 40th edition on 5th March 1989 [<a href="#ARCHIVE-040">ARCHIVE-040</a>]. While the
submissions are good, the delay is just too long. One submitter 
complains that he had 'tried sending [an article] to the list two weeks
ago, but [had] yet to see it appear for general distribution'. The complaint is dated
8th December 1988, but doesn't appear until this 5th March 1989 edition.
Interestingly, a 9th December 1988 submission contains an early draft of CERT 
'Stock message' designed to 'help secure your systems'. CERT's formalisation
was largely in response to the Worm incident, and it was in the process of 
putting basic resources into place: CERT was consulting its community.
</p>

<p>
The 41st edition arrives on 12th April 1989 [<a href="#ARCHIVE-041">ARCHIVE-041</a>], followed another
month later by the 42nd edition on 13 May 1989 [<a href="#ARCHIVE-042">ARCHIVE-042</a>]. This is the 
final edition: Andrew Burt sighs about the lack of
time he can provide, asking for any volunteers to take over, and
indicating that it 'will be the last issue ... sent out'. A number
of submissions are from Neil Gorsuch at zardoz.uucp, or seem to have
been routed via. zardoz - indicating that they have been copied to
both lists. Perhaps the zardoz list has stolen some thunder.
</p>

<p>
The last submissions in the 42nd edition are dated 6th January 1989 and 
befit closing remarks, as Rahul Dhesi states:
</p>

<p>
'I am slightly concerned about the contents of this mailing list.'<br>
'I had originally supposed that the purpose of this mailing list was the
posting of security-related messages that were not appropriate for
posting in an open newsgroup.'<br>
'I was added to the list a few weeks ago, I find that almost nothing
that I have received from this list so far (since I was added to the
list a few weeks ago) has deserved to be restricted to a private
mailing list.'<br>
'I highly recommend that all people sending a message to this list ask
themselves if the message really should be restricted to this list.  If
not, it should probably be posted to an appropriate Usenet newsgroup
and not sent to this list.'
</p>

<p>
to which Matthew Crawford responds with:
</p>

<p>
'I agree with Rahul entirely.'
</p>

<p>
That was the last post.
</p>

<p>
Earlier and elsewhere, in a posting to USENET on 31st March 1989 
[<a href="#USENET-1989-03-31">USENET-1989-03-31</a>], Dan Troxel 
asks 'what is going on with the isis!security list? I have sent 
several times for an application, and not a whimper. 
I have talked to a couple of netters who are on the
list, and they haven't received anything for quite some time.'. A
response by Andrew Burt on 13th April 1989 [<a href="#USENET-1989-04-13">USENET-1989-04-13</a>] suggests
that 'the list is alive', although he'd 'been busy', and 'there
aren't that many' requests to join pending.  Neil Gorsuch replied
on the same day with news that 'the zardoz security list is alive
and well, has over 350 members and welcomes new qualified members'.
Two days later on
15th April 1989 a response [<a href="#USENET-1989-04-15">USENET-1989-04-15</a>] to Andrew Burt's
wonders whether the
mailing list 'must be 4 light-months away from here' as 'the dates
of the messages in this last issue' range between 17th December
1988 and 31st December 1988, and most of these were destined for
zardoz anyway.
</p>

<p>
Len Rose's response to a USENET posting on 17th April 1989 [<a href="#USENET-1989-04-17">USENET-1989-04-17</a>]
has the Subject 'Re: isis!security (ha)' and a Summary 'No Virginia,
Andrew Burt doesn't care.', containing dialogue of a failed sendmail
transaction to the list, with Len's comment 'Too bad this doesn't work
either..'.
</p>

<p>
A final post was made by Andrew Burt to USENET on 13th May 1989 [<a href="#USENET-1989-05-13">USENET-1989-05-13</a>]
with a copy of the message sent out with the final edition of the list.
This was followed by a response from Neil Gorsuch on 19th May 1989
[<a href="#USENET-1989-05-19">USENET-1989-05-19</a>] again selling the 'well established unix security mailing
list hosted on zardoz (cpd.com) that has been joined by over 400 
sites in the last 6 months, and has sent out 21 digests so far 
this year'. Neil provided prescriptive detail about joining the 
list, and some insight into the work taken to maintain it. 
</p>

<p>
The Unix 'Security Mailing List' had yielded to its successor.</p>
