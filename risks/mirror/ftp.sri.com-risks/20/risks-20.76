Subject: The Net enables a Farther Confessor Website

There are plenty of opportunities for sin on the Internet, but precious few
sources of absolution.  So today, Britain's only Christian radio station
launches an online "confession box" for sinful surfers who feel the need to
repent.  The website, www.theconfessor.co.uk allows users to file their
wrongdoings - in return for a comforting Bible text.  The automated response
will not reflect the gravity of the offence: coveting thy neighbour's wife
and throttling thy neighbour's tearaway teenage son elicit similarly
sympathetic passages.  They see a series of contemplative texts and then a
page offering the chance to type out a confession.  They are reassured with
the message: "All you type remains on your computer and will not be
transmitted in any way to anyone else.  This is between you and God and your
privacy is respected."  [Source: *The Guardian* online, 21 Jan 2000]

Subject: U.S. National Archives loses 43K e-mail messages

*The Washington Post*, 6 Jan 2000, reported that the National Archives lost
an estimated 43,000 e-mail messages (the number is a guess based on the
number of users).  The backup system also failed: the contractor was not
doing as instructed (according to the Archives).  The audit log, which might
have shed light, had been turned off because it reduced performance.

The Assistant Archivist says that they've improved the backup system now, 
but "the safest way to save important messages is to print them out".  
Hurrah for the paperless office!

RISKS: What good are backups & audits if they're not used correctly?

According to Noticias Intercom (in Spanish)
  http://www.noticias.com/noticias/2000/0001/n0001202.htm 
quoting *Providence Journal*, the Rhode Island police have stopped arresting
people, because they found that their new system Justice Link asked them to 
arrest eight innocent people.  Justice Link is made by Oracle and Systems &
Computer Technology Corp. Developers found 350 bugs to trigger detention.

Subject: Rhode Island computer arrested innocents

  [...]

The risk is that the innocent victim argues with the police and ends up
dead ... or worse, is beaten, thrown before a judge and falsely convicted.

Makes the prospect of encountering criminals a safer bet than a drive
through Rhode Island.

The part of this that really gets my ire: "We knew we had bad data in the
old warrant system," Harrall said. He added that neither Oracle nor SCT are
at fault, instead attributing a large part of the problem to a rush to get
the system up and running to meet a Y2K deadline.  "I will not hang those on
the vendor," Harrall said.

Thanks for hanging it on the innocent public, instead.

Subject: Hackers steal passwords, cause havoc

A 16-year-old hacker, one of a group calling themselves Global Hell,
infiltrated Pacific Bell's Internet service and lifted codes to the accounts
of 200,000 subscribers. When Eldorado, Calif., detectives checked his
bedroom last week, they found that he'd decrypted 63,000 of those accounts,
causing PacBell to advise those subscribers to change their passwords.
Authorities found the boy after he broke into the computers of an Eldorado
Hills Internet service provider and began bragging about his exploits in a
chat room. According to a sheriff's detective, the same teenager hacked into
26 other sites, including a master computing system at Harvard, before he
was arrested Dec. 14. Authorities expect to charge him with unlawful
computer access and grand theft next month. [Source: *Los Angeles Times*,

Subject: Y2K and satellite orbit predictor software

A popular free-of-charge predictor for UNIX platforms, SatTrack V3.1,
went completely haywire. 
On 7 Jan. it told me:
   Date: XXX -358Jan01    (I think the XXX should be the day of the week)
   UTC : -358-11:-32:-94
   Countdown to next pass: 657443 days 11 hours 32 minutes 10 seconds   
      (this is rather precisely 1800 years)
   Satellite position: 0.0 deg lat. 0.0 deg. long. (does not move)

In all fairness, this version is a few years old; the latest version
comes at a cost, and is said to be Y2K compliant.

Another popular program, WinOrbit 3.5 for Windows 95/98 nearly got it right.
I found only one problem:
   If you want to print the prediction for several future passes, you get a 
   pop-up on which you have to enter the starting time for the calculation. 
   There is a "NOW" button that fills in this entry, giving the year as 00. 
   00 means 1900 to the program. 
   You can type 2000 instead of 00, and you get the correct results.
   Easy, once you know. But it took some time to first discover that the 
   results were wrong, then figure out the work-around.

I am told that yet another predictor works fine in 2000, as long as you use
the orbit parameters, the so-called "2-line elements", from end 1999, but
goes wrong with parameters that have a year entry of 00. I haven't got the
details.

Subject: Y2K Problems with Flight Sim 2000 Professional Edition?

I managed to get Microsoft Flight Sim 2000 Pro Edition for Xmas, great!
After installing I went to the Microsoft web site and found an update - of
course there was one - 9 megabytes in total. I downloaded it, installed it,
everything was fine.

A few days later I did my in-frequent disk cleanups, etc. I had not run
scandisk for ages so set it off. I was surprised when it announced that it
had found a bad file. The file was with one of the Flight Sim 2000 files,
and the problem was that it had an invalid date. This problem occurred with
all the Flight Sim 2000 files that had come as part of the update I had
downloaded.

Was it a Y2K problem? I'm not sure. Everything worked okay and McAfee Virus
Checker didn't complain about funny dates on the files. Of course, it could
have been a problem with the disk scan program.

Subject: U.S. removes most restrictions on encryption software

Finally relenting to continued pressure from the technology industry, the
Clinton Administration has decided to remove virtually all restrictions on
the exportation of powerful data encryption software, and to require
companies to seek government permission only when they plan to sell the
technology to a foreign government or military organization. Companies will
still be prohibited from selling to seven nations thought to be supporting
terrorism: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Sudan, North Korea, and Cuba. Industry
leaders expect the decision to give a significant boost to the sale of U.S.
technology, and Novell chairman Eric Schmidt says it "clearly sets the stage
for the next big growth phase of the Internet." [AP/*San Jose Mercury News*,

Subject: Re: British Visa source-code compromised (RISKS-20.75)

Before we all get too carried away about perceived risks, a few questions
need to be asked. In the interests of credibility, we should not fall into
scaremongering.

As supposedly expert practitioners in computing related risks, we should be
sure we have established a logical thread before we reach conclusion. Other
wise we *risk* being classified with the boy who cried wolf, and thereby
exclude ourselves from contributing to improved security and risk
management.

In the Visa case, what source code was *stolen*? It is extremely unlikely
that it was *the source code for the Visa card system* as stated! There is
no such thing. Like any system, it would consist of many source libraries,
each relating to different modules of the overall system.  So we should be
asking what source was copied?  (You can hardly say it was *stolen*, as that
would imply that it was taken away, leaving the rightful owner without
possession of the item of stolen property, and we all know that is not what
happens in such cases. In a shop like Visa, the code promotion system
maintains multiple copies in the migration libraries, so erasure of the sole
copy is highly unlikely)

Was it the card number validation module?  Perhaps part of staff payroll
processing? or Some CGI for their public web site? or Perhaps an in-house
written reporting tool?  Was it the current version, an old one, a
pre-production one, a half-tested development one?

As it appears that Visa is not stating what code was copied, it is rather
hard to support the assertion that their system was *compromised* in the
manner implied. And what is the basis for stating that *Visa seems to have
had no fall back plan*. What fallback is appropriate when source is
illicitly copied?  What is the threat we need to counter?

It all depends on what was copied.

Subject: Re: Woman ordered to pay back four pence (RISKS-20.75)

Not all billing systems write off *small debts*, or at least didn't always
do so.  When I left UK in 1981 after living and working there for a time, I
took with me my Barclay Visa card and used it for expenses as I took the
long route home to Australia via the US.  Naturally, it took a few months
for all my purchase charges to catch up with me.  (1981 was before
widespread on-line merchant transaction processing). Finally all the charges
were in and I paid out my statement by wire transfer from my Australian
bank. Of course I left it to the last minute to pay, and the payment got to
my Visa account a day or so late.

So, next month I received a statement with one line item - Credit Charges:
40pence (equiv $US.050), contained in an envelope bearing 85 pence in
postage.  At $A5 ($US3.00) in fees per wire transfer, I chose to ignore the
statement.  Next month, another statement for 40p.  And then another.  And
then nothing.  I presume I appeared on the delinquent debtors list for
recovery action and someone at Barclays then realised they had spent
PndsStg2.55 in postage while attempting to recover 40p from the other side
of the world!

Although I've been back to UK numerous times since (twice in the employ of a
Bank and carrying a Corporate Visa card), I do wonder what Barclay's
reaction would be if I ever applied for another card with them? Am I black
listed as a credit risk forever? Or maybe their system has been revamped a
few times since then and the delinquents list wasn't transferred across?

I tried this at work as soon as I heard about it.  Of 5 Outlook users
reporting back, 4 were indeed "blinded" - they did not see the line
beginning "begin" or any text thereafter.  One of them reported seeing an
attachment she could not open.

One user saw the whole test text with no problem.  He believes that the
difference is that he gets his mail from a Microsoft Exchange server rather
than directly (using IMAP?  I don't use Outlook so I don't know what the
other choices are).

So unfortunately, rather than giving a preferential advantage to those who
"spurn Microsoft products" as the original message suggests, this problem
may be taken as evidence that if you buy one Microsoft product, then (to
coin a phrase) you "gotta get them all!"

Outlook 97 on NT, or Outlook Express 4.5 on MacOS. I don't know of any
