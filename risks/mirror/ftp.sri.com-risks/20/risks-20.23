Subject: Intruders commandeer UK military satellite

According to security sources cited by *The Sunday Business*, intruders have
seized control of one of Britain's four military communication satellites --
over two weeks ago -- and demanded blackmail for them to stop interfering
with the satellite.  [Source: Reuters item 28 Feb 1999, PGN-ed. (*)]

   was a hoax, or a very serious event that has been largely covered up.  PGN]

The U.S. Department of Defense is still studying the software glitch that
caused DOD's $184 million Global Transportation Network (GTN) to have up to
eight-hour delays in the availability of updated worldwide logistics
information during the December 1999 Desert Fox bombing operations, despite
GTN having being designed to provide updates worldwide within 30 seconds.
GTN has 23 interfaces with other systems.  [Source: Article by Daniel

Subject: Schwab Squab Swabbed

Charles Schwab & Co's electronic brokerage Website and Street Smart computer
system were off the air for an hour and one-half, beginning 5 minutes after
trading opened on the NYSE on 24 Feb 1999.  The outage was the result of a
software upgrade to hook in a new mainframe system in Phoenix, which failed
to take flight.  This follows failures of other on-line brokerage systems
(E-Trade, Waterhouse, Ameritrade, and Datek) in recent weeks.  I guess the
market pressures are too great for anyone to take the time to do it right.

Today's [London] *Daily Mail* reports that mobile phones cause memory loss.

The $500M Abilene Network is planned as a 2.4 gigabit/sec link among a few
dozen research universities.  To demonstrate this, a doctor in Washington
DC's Union Station will work with a surgical team at Ohio State performing
laparoscopic surgery on a volunteer patient suffering from a
gastrointestinal disorder [an Internaut? seeking gut reactions?].  [Source:
Article by Ted Bridis, Associated Press, 23 Feb 1999, PGN Abstracting]

[Plans for live surgery rather than just remote advice are in the offing.
<Pun NOT INTENDED.> Hopefully, by then the reliability, security, and
general availability of networked systems will have improved sufficiently
that would avoid risks of computer and network outages during open-brain
surgery.  PGN] (Stephen Wolff of Cisco Systems Inc. was quoted as asking one
of the RISKS-related questions that comes to mind: "Can a surgery and
multiplayer Doom coexist on a network?"  [Cisco supplied about $5 million
worth of high-tech network equipment for Abilene.]

[NOTE: They never discuss the stability of the network, do they? Why does
this article remind me of the Star Trek episode where Dr. McCoy is rewiring
Mr. Spock's brain? About half-way through the surgery -- which McCoy had
described as "child's play" just prior to the commercial break -- McCoy
starts to realize that he doesn't know what he's doing because the helmet
he's wearing with all the knowledge in it is starting to fail? Anyone should
be able to figure out when to launch the denial-of-service attack against
the remote connection.  Aren't there plenty of critical moments in just
routine surgery? In this case, there's a world-class specialist helping out
a not-so-world-class specialist, because the surgery is important for some
reason. A bunch of untraceable broken packets have no place in delicate
vascular surgery. KAR]

Subject: Computer system results in errors in patient medical records

Vancouver Hospital installed a new computer system in mid 1997 that sends
pathology reports on-line to the attending physicians.  However, the
software did not automatically update the patients' charts (unless staff
members used a special code, which apparently they usually did not),
significantly delaying treatments and discharges, and increasing costs.

German C't News says that despite Intel's claims, the ability to read the
serial number can be turned on and off remotely under software control,
without the user's knowledge.  The trick uses only documented features.

Subject: Limiting liability for Y2K breakdowns

A bipartisan group in the U.S. House of Representatives has introduced
legislation that would limit litigation, lawyers' fees, and damages caused
by Y2K-related computer breakdowns.  Supporters of the bill claim that it
would help avert Year 2000 problems, since the legislation would protect
only those businesses and individuals who take reasonable actions to prevent
them from occurring.  (*The New York Times*, 24 Feb 1999, Edupage, 25
February 1999) [CA, FL, GA, HA, NV, and VA have already passed such laws.

Subject: CIA predicts serious Y2K problems around the globe

Amidst all the discussion of possible Y2K effects is the issue of foreign
government preparedness.  Air Force Gen. John Gordon, deputy director of the
CIA, appeared at a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee and
testified that other countries (including Russia) are far behind in
preparing for possible crises, noting in particular breakdowns in nuclear
reactors and strategic missile systems, midwinter power outages and
disruptions in world trade and oil shipments.  However, he discounted the
possibility of accidentally missile launches due to Y2K.  But he did add
that malfunctions in temperature and humidity monitors could lead to
incorrect information.  He said that China will probably experience failures
in key sectors such as telecommunications, electric power and banking.

Last October, PSE&G sent incorrect bills to 61,000 of their customers as a

Y2K compliance, the residues from the test data were not properly removed,
resulting in erroneous statements of past payments and amount owed.

Subject: Self-inflicted single point of failure

At approximately 04:10 on Sunday 21 Feb 1999, a transatlantic communications
link belonging to Teleglobe developed a fault. By 19:30 that evening the
fault (whatever it was) was repaired. In the interim period, almost all
Internet connectivity, both within and outside the UK, was lost to customers
of Teleglobe, of one of its major partners (and my main ISP) Cable Internet,
and other ISPs taking their feeds from these two companies, including many
of the UK's new "free" services such as Telinco and Aardvaak.

The situation was compounded by a mail server upgrade which Cable Internet
started at 4am, as part of which *all* routes and DNS caching were
reset. With no easy path to other countries, routers failed to discover new
routes and DNS lookups failed consistently.

I have access to another free ISP apparently unaffected by the cable outage;
but found it too slow to be of any use. That this was caused by increased
traffic as new routes were found, and increased logging-in by users
abandoning their primary ISPs, is mere speculation; but my son had to do
without a better translation than the one I could offer of a key passage in
"Le Roman de la Rose" because of timeouts on many search engines and their
results.

All this is normal fare for the Internet. It is a non-guaranteed service,
after all. That there were no backup routes in place even 12 hours after the
failure is annoying, but I await an explanation of this from Cable Internet.

I was more bemused by the number of people posting messages on Cable
Internet's support newsgroup complaining that they were unable to run their
Internet-reliant businesses because of Cable Internet's failure to provide a
backup service. Naturally, not one of them had made his or her own provision
for a backup by using another ISP.

What this all says about single points of failure is self-evident.

Subject: Profiling

Recently, my wife and I ordered a bunch of tableware from a local
jewelry-and-china-and-crystal store.  Because of our slightly unusual taste,
we had the honor of being the first customers ever to order some of those
items, which meant that the store had no entries in their database for them.
They therefore separated our order into two orders, one for the items that
their database knew about, and the other for the new ones.  Because there
were two orders, there were two charge tickets.

Four days later, after we had finished dinner in a restaurant, and half an
hour before curtain time for the play we were about to see, our waiter
informed us that he had put our credit card through the machine twice, that
it had been declined twice, and that he could call them and talk to them if
we liked.  The ensuing confusion, which took long enough to clear up that we
came within eight minutes of missing our play, involved not only our waiter
but the restaurant manager, who said that the credit card people had
eventually approved the purchase, but that we were to call them at our
earliest convenience.

The problem, of course, was that two purchases in rapid succession at a
jewelry store had tripped the credit card company's fraud detectors, so they
wanted to be sure that we were still in possession of the card and that we
had actually made those purchases.  They had been meaning to call us, but
hadn't gotten around to it yet.

The risk?  Expert-system profilers are adding all kinds of unwritten
rules to our lives, with various kinds of inconvenience and harassment
as the penalty for violating them.

Subject: Re: Store Baelt Bridge not Y2K safe (Weber-Wulff, Risks-20.22)

Not quite right.  The west half of the Storebaelt crossing consists of a
side-by-side road and rail bridge, but the east half has a separate road
bridge while the railway uses a tunnel.  It's the east bridge that opened
last year; the railway (which is presumably the part with a Y2K problem)
opened in April 1997 to freight and June 1997 to passenger trains.

See <http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/denmark/> for a description
of the crossing in English.  (However, it never had the world's longest
main span, as claimed; the Akashi-Kaikyo Bridge in Japan is longer and
opened a month or two earlier.)

Subject: Re: Store Baelt Bridge not Y2K-safe (Weber-Wulff, RISKS-20.22)

The problem is mainly not with the bridge, but with the double train-tunnel
running in parallel. This tunnel was heavily delayed during construction,
due to 'the-fault-that-cannot occur', as both tunnel were flooded!

The only limit on the road bridge would be the toll-gates, and there is a
fast (and cheap :-)) solution to that problem.

The Fault-Tolerant Computing Symposium is being held in Madison

Continuing a new tradition at FTCS, we are pleased to announce the

- introduce new ideas to the community
- state positions on controversial issues ("Outrageous Opinions")

Participants in this session will present a short talk (5 to 8 minutes
including 1 minute for questions), and publish a concise and succinct
(two pages) abstract in a printed proceedings. A web version of the
abstract will also be available on the FTCS website.
