Subject: Risks of upgrades involving e-mail

Our CSL majordomo server was apparently blown away by the installation of a
new version of sendmail.  If you received a bounce on a subscription change
request on the Ides of March (Monday 15 Mar), or if you requested a change
but this issue is still using your old address, please try again.  TNX.  PGN

Beginning last Friday, an enormous number of pieces of mail on a private
distribution to me at sri.com rather than the customary CSL found their way
into a black hole as the result of a seemingly harmless DNS upgrade made by
the sys admins at sri.com.  Fortunately, someone deduced that I was not
responding, which triggered the discovery and temporary fixing of the
otherwise undetectable problem (there were no bounces, just bit-buckets).
I am told that the fix will go away on the next upgrade, so please use
only my CSL address.

Once again we are reminded of the incredible variety of risks of e-mail.

OCTOBER 1969: 
Leonard Kleinrock, a UCLA computer science professor, sends the first
e-mail message to a colleague at Stanford. The computer promptly crashes.

   -- and nothing much has changed since.
      amusing list, btw. worth a look.

  [Well, it was certainly not the FIRST e-mail message, but it might well
  have been the first ARPAnet e-mail message.  USNews should add earlier
  items, such as the CTSS e-mail system written by Tom Van Vleck and Noel
  Morris, which I used during the early Multics days in 1965, and it
  apparently did *not* cause any crashes.  A paper reference is found in
  CTSS Programming Staff Note 39 by Glenda Schroeder, Louis Pouzin,
  and Pat Crisman, undated, but it was prior to PSN 40, which was dated 
  8 Jan 1965.  RISKS will be happy to set the record straight on any

Subject: Power outage leaves hospitals in the dark

On Wednesday, March 10, 1999, two of the three hospitals that make up Long
Island Jewish Medical Center in Long Island, NY were without power for a
period of 47 minutes, starting at 5:58pm.  Patient care was apparently not
impacted, although 2 operations were completed by battery operated lights
and bags of ice were hauled from the cafeteria to the blood bank to keep
things cold.  Life support equipment has an internal battery backup and kept
functioning during the outage.

Investigations are underway to determine none of the four backup generators
worked.

Kids, let this be a lesson.  It's not enough to have a backup system in
place...you need to make sure it will work when needed.

In the same page, there are comments from the readers.  Some mention that
they can find information such as credit card #, directory names where
important files are kept, etc. that they think should not be in the files.
I think some of these observations are due to the re-use of old file blocks
without clearing the file blocks first.

In any case, it is a little disturbing to think that `1984' has arrived
without much fanfare.  [Surprised?  RISKS began in 1985, and we

Subject: Y2K is the least of it

I just got off the phone with support line of the remaining Boston Bank (no
need to name it except for those who don't know about Fleet taking over
BankBoston). Their home banking does not work with Internet Explorer 5. This
would be understandable if they had tested and discovered a new problem with
the retail release or if Microsoft hadn't mentioned that a new release was
coming out.

But, in December, I had a long e-mail exchange when IE5 suddenly stopped
working with their service and the response was that they didn't support
unreleased browsers and weren't even curious about why it might have stopped
working.

Today I had two conversations with their support staff. During the first one
they basically said it was Microsoft's fault because they released a new
browser. I presume they'll blame the Pope for surprising them with the year
2000. They also made up excuses such as IE5 not having 128 bit security,
which was totally bogus.

Even if any of this were true, it is still the bank's fault since if were is
an IE5 problem, they should simply produce a message saying the browser is
not supported instead of simply going mute.

I then looked at the code. If I read it correctly, the progress messages are
completely bogus and are generated by a local timing loop purely to pacifier
the user.  More striking was that the body of the message looked like the
boiler plate for the web page. It seems as if the server explicitly checks
for the browser version and produces browser-specific HTML. For IE5, it
seems to fall through to the template code but there is no error checking. I
called back and spoke to a supervisor who accepted my analysis, but there
wasn't much he could do about it. At least, it reduced my hostility.

This is very disturbing since it is so trivial and obvious and, even more
so, something I had reported in December. Unlike the subtle bugs often
reported here, this is simply stupid and inexcusable. There doesn't seem to
be much connection between the support staff and the backroom. It is very
embarrassing since it is so visible and unnecessary. Even more so since the
IE4 support simply worked in IE5 and someone had to explicitly break the
support on (or about) December 28, 1998.

Sadly, this will soon be the last of the larger banks in Boston ... IE5 
does work with BankBoston.

Subject: Sri Lankan Banks to close on 31 Dec 1999 for Y2K tests

Central Bank has decided to close all banks to the public December 31 this
year to do the final assessment on all computer systems compliance to the
Year 2000 (Y2K) problem.  [Beginning of an item in *The Island*, 12 Mar
1999, noting that employees will be at work.  PGN-ed]

Risks:

1. December 31 appears to be a little late for final testing of Y2K
readiness. What if something isn't ready? Oh, well there'll still be the
weekend to fix it I suppose!

2. The contingency plan to close on December 30 as well would seem to be
superfluous. Will the decision to close then be made half way through
testing on 31st when they realise they don't have enough time?

3. Moving the deadline from March 31 to June 30 would also appear to be a
time waster. What will happen if some banks are still lagging behind in
June, will the deadline move again? Will it keep moving until it reaches
December 31? That's one deadline which won't move!

4. That some bankers were not even aware of the Y2K problem is beyond
belief. Which banks? I want my money out now!

5. The CEB is only testing power plants they suspect aren't compliant. What
about the rest?

6. [Power plant] Sapugaskanda was confirmed as compliant, but won't
work after 2001. How many other power plants around the world will fail on
January 1, 2002?

7. The operating system is too advanced for the local staff. What more can I
say?

Subject: Coming to terms with "bytes"

Computer terminology is becoming more precise: the International
Electrotechnical Commission, which creates standards for electronic
technologies, is adopting new prefixes to describe data values.  The new
term "kibibyte" will more accurately describe the number of bytes in a
kilobyte -- rather than being 1,000, as could be inferred by the prefix
"kilo," a kilobyte actually has 1,024 (2 to the 10th power) bytes.  The
metric prefixes currently employed -- kilo, mega, giga, etc. -- accumulate
as a power of 10, rather than the binary system used in computer code.
Thus, the Commission will use kibi, mebi, gibi, tebi, pebi and exbi to
express exponentially increasing binary multiples (2 to the 10th power, 2 to
the 20th power, etc.).  "There was a need to straighten this out," says
Barry Taylor of the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
(*Science*, 12 Mar 1999; Edupage, 16 March 1999)

  [This may lead to kibi-tsars, mebi-or-mebi-not, gibi-ous moonings, 
  tele-tebi, pebi-le-mocha, and exbi-gated Websites.  (Garrulous in the NIST?)
  But, following on an earlier observation from Peter and Dorothy Denning,
  it does create a new solution to the Y2K problem: 
    Change K from kilo to kibi, which puts the problem off until 2048.  PGN]

Subject: Signs of the times

Port Moody, BC, (where I currently reside) installed some nice "Welcome
to..." signs a few years ago. They incorporate a nice little automated light
display which typically is used to tell us about upcoming local events.

For the last month or so, one sign has been consistently displaying "NO
CARRIER". Which probably gives us some indication about how these are getting
their daily dose of information. 

Wonder if the modem is fried or did someone forget to pay the phone bill?

  [Carrier is a major producer of air conditioning.  In that the air in
  Port Moody obviously does not need conditioning, I'd like to imagine that
  the sign was hacked by the Carrier Corporation in protest.  But more
  likely, the sign is programmed to grab the message of the day remotely and
  could not connect.  PGN]

Subject: Treating names as abbreviations

About a year or so ago, I got a letter from the marketing department of
British Gas (with whom I have a gas account) addressed to me as "Mr
Attorney".  My bills arrived correctly addressed to "Mr Atty".  I
subsequently discovered my father had had a similarly addressed letter.

This summer I moved house, and moved my gas account.  Properly addressed
bills arrived.  Then, last week, a marketing letter arrived for "Mr
Attorney".

So, somewhere inside British Gas is something that transfers names and
addresses from their billing system to their marketing system.  And for some
incomprehensible reason, it treats people's names as abbreviations and
expands them.  And what is even odder, it doesn't expand titles ("Mr" rather
than "Mister".  The fact I'm "Dr", and have told them so, is a side issue).

Overseas readers should note that "Atty" is not used in Britain for
"Attorney" - I'd never come across it in my life until I started to
use the internet.  So anyone else with my (rare) surname could be
utterly confused.

Needless to say, the letter completely fails in persuading me I should
let them anywhere near my heating system.  And I've had a lot of fun
wondering just what it does to other people's names.

%T   "Time Based Security"

The idea is simple, and even elegant.  Given enough time and
resources, somebody is going to be able to crack whatever security you
put in place.  Therefore, instead of building ever bigger and more
imposing (and expensive) walls, balance how long it will take someone
to get through the wall against how long it will take you to figure
out that digging is going on and how long it will take you to stick a
fire hose down a putative gopher hole.

The idea isn't, of course, radically new.  Community policing officers
have been saying the same thing in public security seminars for years. 
Make the bad guy take longer to get in, and you'll have more time for
someone to notice, or for us to get there.

Implementation, though, is not quite so simple.  Especially when you
are dealing with something as complex as a publicly accessible and
networked computer system.

Chapter one is a general promotion for the Time Based Security (TBS)
model, which hasn't been presented yet.  The introduction's cry that
we never have enough time and have to move ever faster is reiterated
in chapter two, along with another assurance that Time Based Security
is what we need.  The demise of the big, limited, simple to protect
computer is bemoaned in chapter three.  Chapter four says that the
fortress mentality never did work, and besides, we want people (some
people) to access our systems for some purposes.  (Were it not for the
fact that the chapters are so short, and the vague idea that we are
getting closer to TBS, I would be getting a little impatient about
now.)  Sorry, but chapter five goes into the shortest history of
computer security I think I've ever seen, six says it didn't work, and
seven runs us right back to Jesse James.  But by the end of chapter
seven, we are at least pointed in the right direction: the security of
a container is a comparison between the time the bad guys need to get
in, and the time the good guys need to get there.  This is repeated in
a different form in chapter eight.  Chapters nine to eleven repeatedly
formularize this, pointing out that you need to measure your
protection in terms of time to fail, and that the time taken to detect
a problem, plus the time taken to effectively respond to it, must be
less than the time the protection provides.  Schwartau gets into a lot
more detail, though for only one situation, with a questionnaire in
chapter twelve.

Chapter thirteen starts to get into the complexity of things, looking
at the variable amounts of damage that can be done in a given amount
of time.  Fourteen looks at costs of attacks while fifteen talks about
the value of data.  The title of chapter sixteen seems to indicate
that some things don't need protecting, while the content looks more
like some things cannot be exposed to any level of risk.  Recursion of
detection is promoted in seventeen.  I think that chapter eighteen is
suggesting that you use multiple barriers to stop intruders.  But I'm
not very sure of that.  Nineteen and twenty seem to be saying that you
should protect vital points with greater security, and try to avoid
"single points of failure."

Chapter twenty one looks at improving the reaction time.  Twenty two
stresses the importance of taking a long time to look at all the
options in order to assess your security.  (This is in rather stark
contradiction to the promises on the cover and in the introduction
that TBS was going to provide a shortcut.)  A few options to increase
protection get some detail in twenty three while increased detection
is looked at in twenty four.  A metric is achievable with TBS, but
chapter twenty five does rather gloss over the work you will have to
go to in order to accomplish it.

Chapter twenty six talks about denial of service, but does not really
integrate it with the TBS concept.  Some infowar classes are used to
repeat the adjuration to put protection where it is most needed in
chapter twenty seven.  Twenty eight suggests that deception is a good
protective tool.  (Sounds just a tad like security by obscurity, but
we'll let it go, shall we?)  The final chapter again promises that TBS
will give you measurable security.

The concept is sound.  The implementation is left as an exercise to the
reader.
