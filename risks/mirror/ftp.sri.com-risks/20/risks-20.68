Subject: RST discovers defective crypto in Netscape mail password saver

Because remembering your passwords is a pain (you do have more than one,
don't you?), many programs are set up to remember them for you.  Exactly how
they do this is a risky business.  Netscape didn't do it right.  Beyond simply
stealing e-mail passwords, our discovery provides a gateway to other accounts
and systems since people generally use the same password
everywhere. Netscape has been notified of the flaw.

The POP3 and IMAP protocols are often used to read e-mail on a home or
office PC from a central mail server.  As a convenience to the user, many
programs offer to remember the user's password.  When Netscape offers to
save your e-mail password, it is encrypted before being stored in the
registry or preferences file on your computer.

Unfortunately, the encryption algorithm used by Netscape to scramble
passwords is exceptionally weak.  Tim Hollebeek, an RST Research Associate,
and John Viega, a member of the RST Software Security Group, were able to
deduce the algorithm after only eight hours of work.  No reverse engineering
of the software was involved.  Instead, a few hundred carefully chosen
passwords were analyzed using pencil and paper.  The algorithm turns out to
be a simple combination of XOR with a constant key and a substitution cipher
weaker than those found in puzzle magazines. For more details, see
http://www.rstcorp.com/news/bad-crypto.html

Once the cipher is known, recovering a POP3 or IMAP password stored on a
machine is trivial.  Any attacker with physical access to the victim's
machine or the ability to run code on it can use our exploit.  Additionally,
passwords can be stolen from some versions of Netscape remotely using
Javascript.

RST has created a working password snagging attack in the lab.  A successful
attack allows the bad guy to download and read a victim's e-mail from a
remote machine. Since careful use of the hack would not leave too many
obvious clues, a victim's e-mail could be snooped indefinitely.  The only
workaround is to turn off the ``remember password'' feature.

Though stealing mail alone is a very serious security/privacy problem, more
dangerous scenarios exist. The largest risk is that people use the same
password for POP3 and other logins to remote machines (and maybe even their
PGP passphrase).  In particular, many people use IMAP or POP3 to access work
related e-mail from home, and their mail password is also the login password
they use at work.  In fact, the login account and the mail account are often
the same.  Home computers are notoriously insecure and easy to penetrate.  A
malicious attacker can read the POP3 password stored on an insecure home
computer (often over the net) and use it to log in to a more secure machine
run by the victim's employer.  The attacker can then take control of an
account, read sensitive information, attack more privileged accounts, and
set up remote monitoring systems inside a corporate network.  Our exploit
code could also be used as a payload in a much more insidious version of
Melissa.

  Quote of the day: ``We didn't do this with just a pencil and some paper.
Lots of our notes are in pen.  We didn't need to erase much.'' Tim Hollebeek
& John Viega

  Other quote: ``This is another illustration of how bad closed,
proprietary, cryptography is.  What makes this vulnerability particularly
nasty is that people tend to use the same passwords over and over again.  If
you can attack someone's mail server password, you're likely to also have
their login password, PGP password, etc.  Software security is important.''

Subject: Canada Post has "electronic post" on line

Canada Post has recently been announcing it's new on-line mail service,
"epost", at http://www.epost.ca/.  They claim it's a secure on-line service
for handling mail and bills via the web, as if it's something new and
unique.

Why would I need an on-line central post office if I can PGP encrypt/sign my
messages, or use a corporations SSL-enabled web site to view and pay my
bills?

In addition, they still fall into the standard security traps.  Your
"secure" e-mail is stored on their servers, where it is vulnerable to non-web
based attacks.  This is equivalent to having the paper version of the post
office open and sort all of your mail for you.

Their security statement at

      http://www.epost.ca/guided/english/why_2a.html

has the following wonderful quote:

   If you are accessing your ELECTRONIC POST OFFICE BOX[tm] using a Web
   browser, you do not need to worry about viruses since no data are
   exchanged between the computer you are using and our system.

Umm... right.  How many security related browser bugs have their been in the
past year?

Subject: Sanity.com: buy now, pay never

The following is a summary of an article found on page 101 of the
*Sydney Morning Herald*, Saturday November 27, 1999.

Sanity.com's web-site, www.sanity.com.au, an online audio CD shop, was
launched on October 18, 1999 with a significant flaw. It was possible to
order CDs and not have to pay for them.

Reports of the flaw resulted in Internet users swamping the web-site,
prompting an official to say "We're close to having a meltdown."

The problem with the site began with a design flaw which was originally
contrived to make life easier for consumers. Customers are given the
option of ordering a CD online but are not required to enter their credit
card details online if they feel uncomfortable about security.

The intention is of course that these customers would phone, fax or
e-mail their credit card details before receiving their goods. However,
the site does not tell consumers the phone numbers or e-mails to use to 
pass on credit card details.

Customers who omitted their credit card details soon discovered they
received the CDs anyway. Invoices obtained by the *Herald* showed that
the "payment by" field was left blank.

Global Fulfilment, a US-based company, which provides the technical,
financial and ordering system for the site, denied any technical error,
but did reveal that the Sanity.com website had not installed an automated
credit card processing system in the first few weeks of operation.

Sanity.com has cut its relationship with Global Fulfilment for the
technical design of the site, which will now be done on-site. Global
Fulfilment will still provide coordination and fulfilment of CD orders.

Sanity.com's shares are set to debut on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASE)
today (Tuesday November 30, 1999) after an AUD$8.4m float of 14%.
Sanity.com maintains it lost no substantial revenue due to the free CDs and
is therefore under no obligation to file a prelisting disclosure to the ASE.
Sanity.com has stated that the problem has been fixed and that no customer
would be retrospectively billed for any free CDs.

Subject: A Tale of Two Web Sites: Calling it secure doesn't make it so

My wife was recently engaging in some on-line Christmas shopping, and
stopped short of placing orders with two merchants because the usual "secure
site" icon was not being displayed on the web browser's status line (both
the latest versions of Netscape and Internet Explorer flagged the pages as
unsecured).

The first point of interest was that both sites featured prominent "This
site is secure" assurances, with links to pages explaining that they use
secure servers to protect credit card and other customer information.

A little investigation showed that the first site, http://www.toysrus.com,
really was using a secure https server, but the secured page was appearing
as a frame inside a larger page from an unsecure server, thus fooling both
browsers into displaying the "unsecured" icon.

The second site, http://www.thesportsauthority.com, showed no signs at all
of using any security mechanism despite their stated "Privacy and Security
Policy".  We sent a message to their customer service address complaining of
this fact and asking if they would honor the sale prices advertised on their
web site even if we were to call their toll-free number and place the order
by telephone.  Their response absolutely floored us:

  "Thank you for writing to www.thesportsauthority.com.

  We apologize for any problems you are having using our site and appreciate
  your concerns and criticism regarding security.  Please try placing your
  order again, as there has been ongoing adjustments to the pages.  All our
  orders in the online store are placed via the Internet, even if you were
  to call us." [remainder omitted]

In other words, whether you click or whether you call, your credit card
number is going out over the net via plain-text!

So, one site that is secure masquerades as insecure. Another is truly
insecure, whether you use it or not!

Subject: IDs in color copies and prints: confirmed

Greetings.  In my latest PRIVACY Forum Digest, I've presented
a report confirming the fact (well known in the copier trade,
but something of an urban legend for everyone else) that xerographic
color copiers/printers include "steganographically" encoded IDs.
Essentially, these IDs are encoded repeatedly as part of the
background "noise" in images, and cannot be decoded without
knowledge of the proprietary algorithms involved.

The full report can be viewed at:

http://www.vortex.com/privacy/priv.08.18

In that report, I mentioned the possibility of such IDs being implemented
within inexpensive, consumer-level equipment.  This could include both
copiers and such widely-used devices as inkjet printers.  Those readers who
might question this possibility might wish to take a look at:

http://www.bep.treas.gov/countdeterrent.htm

which is a Bureau of Engraving and Printing procurement offering

It may be worth pointing out that a more correct way of implementing this
loop is

  size_t size = BUFSIZE;
  while (size-- > 0) {
     /* ... */
  }

The original code fails in the subtle case when buf + BUFSIZE extends past
the end of the address space. Note that the ANSI C guarantee that you should
be able to compute the address of the first element beyond the end of a
named array doesn't apply if buf is dynamically allocated.

This common idiom, while it's guaranteed to work if buf is a named array of
characters, will fail if buf was dynamically allocated -- yet almost every
programmer I've seen uses the same idiom for both cases.

(See Writing Solid Code by Steve Maguire, p 132.)

PS. Yes, I do realize that in the context of a local buffer with hardcoded
size, which was the topic of the original post, this idiom is okay.

Subject: Risk of APC Power Chute

I recently installed APC's Power Chute Plus for Win98/NT, which allows
control of various features of their UPS devices.  I was surprised when I
started the program that it listed two possible devices, mine and another
machine in my building.

It turns out that the default installation of PC+ sets up the installation
directory as shared to everyone in your workgroup - perhaps a fine idea for
corporate networks, but not the right idea for cable modems and campus dorms
(my case).  I don't want my neighbors to have the ability to simulate a
power failure - with the loud warning beep - at 4 AM, or otherwise mess with
the settings.

I happened to have file sharing turned off, so the properties of the
directory were ignored.  I was surprised that this was not mentioned during
the install process, but instead buried in the help file.  APC tells me they
will consider my recommendation to switch the default, and let the
(presumably) more knowledgeable corporate network administrator enable the
feature if he wants it.

Just another risk of shared networks.

From: Thomas Roessler <roessler@guug.de>
Subject: Risks of e-mail monitoring

In some small firms, a simplistic approach may be applied to monitor
employees' electronic mail: A responsible person inside the firm receives a
copy of each incoming message, and possibly carbon copies of outgoing
messages.

The privacy problems of this approach are obvious, however, they are not
what this is about.  In fact, there is another risk for the person who
*receives* the message copies which is not completely obvious.

This risk is closely linked to the way in which most e-mail clients in
common use today display message overviews to users.  In most cases, users
are pesented a list of message senders and subjects.  The list of recipients
is not shown, and no indication of the recipient is given, since the
software assumes that every message in the user's inbox is intended for him.
(There are exceptions from this, for instance the pine and mutt e-mail
clients for Unix.)

Given no help from the software, the user will make up his own mapping from
the information presented to him (i.e., subjects and message senders) to
recipients. In particular, when there are some message senders who
correspond with one or two employees on a regular basis, the person doing
the monitoring will mis-recognize messages from these senders which are
actually directed to her, and not to the senders' usual correspondence
partners.  The monitoring personnel may even delete these messages unread
when the correspondence between the parties in question is not considered
worth the effort of closer monitoring.

Given that the monitoring personnel might frequently be senior employees,
this effect may even lead to the loss of particularly important e-mail
messages sent by clients to these senior employees.


The cure?  Use e-mail clients which tell you whether your e-mail is personal
or not.  Or, even better, use a reasonable e-mail monitoring policy which
(1) avoids the privacy implications of the simplistic scheme and (2) makes
it possible to easily distinguish surveillance output from personal
messages.  Finally, senior employees may just be forced to read *all*
messages which reach their e-mail inbox.  However, this may not be an option
depending on the amount of noise introduced by the monitoring.

Unfortunately, merely returning the customer's own coin is not sufficient.
Unless there are other restrictions, it's almost as easy for the crook to
make some trivial purchase, requiring most of his supposed money to be
returned as change.  (This is a common counterfeiter tactic, although in
