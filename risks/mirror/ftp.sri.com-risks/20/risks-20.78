Subject: CIA Director Deutch and MLS

An article in *The New York Times* 1 Feb 2000 details former CIA Director
Deutch's use of unclassified Macintosh computers in his homes to store
thousands of highly classified documents on the same computer he used to
access AOL, Citibank's personal banking service, and other services.  The
investigation seems to have been delayed and perhaps limited as a result of
Deutch's position.

It's old hat that personal computers (be they Windows, Macintosh, or
UNIX-based) are inherently unsuitable for Multi-Level Security (MLS).  What
we see here is that even though all the proper procedures were in place, the
human element is sufficient to undermine all of the technical controls.  As
long as we have people, we'll have RISKS!

Full article at 
http://www.nytimes.com/yr/mo/day/news/washpol/cia-impeach-deutch.html

  [Multilevel security may not seem to be an issue here *internally*
  because John Deutch had access to all of the information on his
  systems, considered as SYSTEM HIGH -- that is all logically at the 
  highest level.  However, surfing the (unclassified) Web is clearly a NO-NO
  from such a machine.  RISKS readers are of course familiar with the risks
  of Web browsing.  However, an added note in this case was the report that
  the visited sites included a porn site.  Deutch apparently denied having
  accessed porn any sites, suggesting that it might have been done by one of
  his offspring?  If that is indeed true, it would make the presence of
  highly classified information on a multiuser workstation even more
  untenable.  (On one hand, even if such a PC claimed to be multilevel
  secure, that would be a VERY BAD misuse.  On the other hand, RISKS readers
  know how one can be duped into visiting sites other than what was
  expected, as in clicking on whitehouse.com instead of whitehouse.gov,
  or in clicking on a Trojan-horsed URL.)  PGN]

Systems Affected
     * Web browsers
     * Web servers that dynamically generate pages based on unvalidated
       input
       
Overview
   A web site may inadvertently include malicious HTML tags or script in
   a dynamically generated page based on unvalidated input from
   untrustworthy sources. This can be a problem when a web server does
   not adequately ensure that generated pages are properly encoded to
   prevent unintended execution of scripts, and when input is not
   validated to prevent malicious HTML from being presented to the user.

Subject: NSA system inoperative for four days

For almost the entire work week of 24 Jan 2000, failures of NSA computers
caused an information blackout for intercepted messages.  The failure was
blamed by one report on a ``system overload'', by another report on a
software problem.  [Sources: NSA System Inoperative for Four Days,

Subject: Leak lets 64 get rich quick

On Wednesday, February 2, 2000, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)
formally announced an increase in the official interest rates of 0.5%.

The formal announcement was made at 09:30. However, in what turned out to be
an embarrassing mistake for the RBA, 64 people were sent an e-mail at 09:24
(i.e., 6 minutes early) advising them of the rate increase.  This was quite
remarkable in itself, as the RBA has a near-legendary record of security.

The information proved to be very valuable for two reasons. Not only
was the information available early to a very small segment of the
market, the size of the rate increase was unexpected. Virtually the
entire market had been expecting/predicting an increase of just 0.25%.

In the 6 minutes prior to 09:30, approximately AUD$3 billion worth of
bill and bond futures were dumped on the market.

The record of trades at the Sydney Futures Exchange demonstrates the
selling frenzy. When interest rates last rose, on November 3, 1999,
336 three-year bond futures contracts and 324 90-day bank bill futures
were traded between 09:25 and 09:30. The corresponding trades preceding
yesterday's announcement were 2,739 and 2,811.

To quote an unnamed trader: "Some people made a lot of money in those
few minutes."

Subject: EFIS failure main suspect in Crossair crash

Flight data displays such as airspeed and attitude indicators as well
as navigation displays on modern commercial aircraft are nowadays
electronic, replacing mechanical displays that were common until
10-15 years ago. Mechanical displays are often used as backup, 
although there are electronic backup displays available on the market.
Mechanical displays were/are not susceptible to total outage. Airspeed
indicators are basically differential barometers, and mechanical
attitude indicators are gyroscopes. 

According to Flight International's David Learmount (01-07.02.2000,
p12), Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS) failure is the "main
possibility" being looked at by the Swiss accident investigation people
(BEAA) in the crash of the Crossair Saab 340B just after takeoff from
Zuerich on 10 January. This was Crossair's first accident. I emphasise
that the causes of the accident have not been established. It is hoped
that the non-volatile memory on the EFIS displays can be recovered
and read, to determine how what the pilots were seeing corresponds
(or not!) with the flight profile recorded by the flight data recorder.
(This is a benefit not provided by mechanical displays, although it
would hardly make up for the susceptibility of EFIS to outages!)

EFIS failures have been noted in particular in incidents involving
a Virgin A340 and a Martinair B767 (see the compendium 
Computer-Related Incidents With Commercial Aircraft on my WWW site).
A Formosa Airlines Saab 340B descended into the ocean on 18 March 1998,
and it has been rumored that one EFIS display was known before the
flight not to be functioning.

Subject: Terra spacecraft problems

*Flight International*, 11-17 Jan 2000, p29, reports that NASA has fixed
"computer and antenna faults" on the Terra spacecraft, launched 18 Dec
1999. Terra is part of the Earth Observing System.  "The main computer shut
down shortly after launch because of a bug in the navigation software,
according to NASA." The failure occurred a minute before the winter
solstice, while the sun's position in the nav software was being updated.

On the other side of things, the antenna "was repaired by alterations to the
software", at which one can only marvel.  Maybe Uri Geller is now
programming for a living.  Or maybe they meant the problem was worked
around.

Subject: Yahoo suit compares cookies to stalking 

A lawsuit filed by Dallas-based Universal Image Inc. accuses Yahoo! of
violating Texas law when it collects "cookies" from Web site visitors. "We
think the court will declare the use of cookies illegal in Texas," says
Universal attorney Lawrence Friedman. "It is electronic stalking. It
violates the eavesdropping statutes, and from a civil aspect it's an
invasion of privacy." Friedman says he plans to file a class-action lawsuit
against the company. Meanwhile, DoubleClick was sued last week by a
California woman who claims the online ad company illegally collected and
sold her personal and demographic data.  [ZDNet/MSNBC 28 Jan 2000)

Subject: China to require encryption information

[On 31 Jan 2000] China's government plans to institute a rule requiring
foreign firms in China to disclose what type of software they use for
encrypting their electronic messages. Eventually, the companies must divulge
details about employees using the software, making it easier for authorities
to monitor personal and commercial Internet use. The new rules also bar
Chinese companies from buying products containing foreign-designed
encryption software, a move that could stymie the growth of Internet use in
that country. Diplomatic missions are exempted, but the regulations cover
the routers and servers that make up the backbone of China's networks, most
of which came from foreign companies. "If IBM or Hewlett-Packard wants to
sell an e-commerce Web server to China, it might have to isolate which parts
relate to security" and find a Chinese company to write the software, says
the director of the U.S. Information Technology Office's Beijing branch. "I
don't think Chinese companies have that ability." [*Wall Street Journal*, 25

Subject: Study criticizes health sites for privacy intrusions
 
In a study conducted for the California HealthCare Foundation, the
Georgetown University's Health Privacy Project has found that drkoop.com,
webmd.com, ivillage.com, yahoo.com, onhealth.com, and other Web sites that
provide information on health matters are cavalier about privacy practices:
"The privacy policies of health Web sites do not match up with their own
practices."  Example: some companies share e-mail addresses and other
visitor data even though their Web sites promised they would do no such
thing. The companies are disputing the study findings.

From: Jason Axley <jason.axley@attws.com>
Subject: More risks with MS Outlook

The recent threads about information hiding in MS Outlook are quite timely
as I've just recently discovered an interesting information hiding "feature"
of MS Outlook.

I received an e-mail from an MS Outlook user that was transmitted to me via
SMTP.  The e-mail was in MIME multipart/alternative format and, as such, had
two attachments: a plain text version of the e-mail content and another
attachment with the exact same message in HTML format.  Outlook has settings
that let users control which format they sent Internet users e-mail in and
this user has Outlook configured to send both versions (I believe that this
is the default setting when sending to non-Exchange addresses).

I replied to this individual using Pine but then this individual responded
saying that my message was received, but that there wasn't any additional
text in it.  I thought this strange as I can see in my sent-mail that I did
reply with additional text.  So, I sent the message again and again was told
that there wasn't any text in the message.

It turns out that what was happening was that I had modified the plain text
version of the multipart/alternative MIME message (which is the one that
Pine opens as the actual message), but that when Pine sent the reply, it
included the HTML "alternative" version as an attachment as well (although
this was an alternative for the *original* message) Outlook then ignores the
modified plain text version because it thinks that the attached HTML version
is the same message, just in HTML.  So, the recipient was seeing the
original HTML message that I hadn't modified and was not able to see the
plan text version.  Outlook doesn't even list the plaintext version as an
attachment so Outlook users cannot access the information there even if they
wanted to!

Ironically, the text that Exchange or Outlook puts in the message header for
non-MIME-compliant MUAs says "This message is in MIME format.  Since your
mail reader does not understand this format, some or all of this message may
not be legible."

Subject: Organisms do not adapt to their environment! 

(Was: Lessons of Y2K, Toby Gottfried, RISKS-20.77)

This is backwards? 

ORGANISMS DO NOT ADAPT TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT. That is a fallacy called
adaptionism!!!

Evolution works by not anticipating the need for solutions but having enough
disparate solutions so that, given a problem, it's likely that there will be
a solution that works.

This resiliency is the real reason that Y2K was a nonissue. Systems as
brittle as the ones posited by the Y2K theorists don't work in practice and
have largely been eliminated from the ecosystem. New brittleness will be
discovered and some will be replaced by small scale alternatives and other
failures may be larger scale.

The big danger is the hubris associated with the notion that we must have a
vision to avoid pitfalls. Of course we shouldn't be stupid and should
anticipate obvious problems. But it is far more important to assume that we
will continue to surprised and need to have enough "fat" available to
survive problems.

It's also foolish to posit that we must model safety on static systems and
limit our possibilities to what we can do unaided and unenhanced. If we
eschew mechanical aids, why should we be more tolerant of cognitive aids
such as logic, reason and testing which often confound common sense and
faith.

In nature (to personify emergent behavior) systems only function in riskful
dynamic states. The static state for an organism or other ecosystem is
called death. The conversion of necessities into luxuries is most natural.
Skin, for example, is no longer an option.

Nature can't be fooled but we can do a fine job in deluding ourselves.

In an essay I'm writing, I was reminded of the book *Fatal Words* by Steven
Cushing [ISBN 0-226-13201-3].  It's about misunderstandings between pilots
and instructions from the ground and other consequences of the World War II
communications and avionics still in use. A great example of what happens
when certification and irrational fear of risk prevent improvements in
technology and safety.

Subject: abcnews.com manually updates copyright year

Articles written during the first week or so of 2000 on abcnews.com have
a misdated notice at the bottom of the page:  "Copyright (C)1999 ABC
News Internet Ventures."  However, the dateline (which shows the place,
month, and day, but usually omits the year) and the URL (which has an
embedded date of the form YYMMDD) together clearly mark the article's
date.  One can still view articles exhibiting this glitch, for example:

http://www.abcnews.go.com/sections/science/DailyNews/clone_cells000105.html

I notified abcnews.com Tech Support on January 6, and within several days,
all new articles had the correct copyright year.  This leads me to believe
that abcnews.com may use a hardcoded copyright year, which someone forgot
to update in a timely fashion.

I wonder how many programs and systems out there require manual year
rollover ... in this case, the slipup was of little consequence.
