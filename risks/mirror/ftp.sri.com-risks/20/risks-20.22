Subject: Process-table attack

Wide-ranging attack works against almost any UNIX systems on the Internet

ABSTRACT:

The Process Table Attack is a [relatively] new kind of denial-of-service
attack that can be waged against numerous network services on a variety of
different UNIX systems. The attack is launched against network services
which fork() or otherwise allocate a new process for each incoming TCP/IP
connection.  Although the standard UNIX operating system places limits on
the number of processes that any one user may launch, there are no limits on
the number of processes that the superuser can create other than the hard
limits imposed by the operating system. Since incoming TCP/IP connections
are usually handled by servers that run as root, it is possible to
completely fill a target machine's process table with multiple
instantiations of network servers. Properly executed, this attack prevents
any other command from being executed on the target machine.

DETAILS

In the book Practical UNIX and Internet Security, Gene Spafford and I
observed that the UNIX operating system originally contained few defenses to
protect it from a denial-of-service attack. This is changing. With the
growth of the Internet, there has been a concerted effort in recent years to
strengthen the operating system and its network services to these attacks.

Each time a network client makes a connection to a network server, a number
of resources on the server are consumed. The most important resources
consumed are memory, disk space, and CPU time. Some network services, such
as sendmail, now monitor system resources and will not accept incoming
network connections if accepting them would place the system in jeopardy.

One system resource that has escaped monitoring is the number of processes
that are currently running on a computer. Most versions of UNIX will only
allow a certain number of processes to be running at one time. Each process
takes up a slot in the system's process table. By filling this table, it is
possible to prevent the operating system from creating new processes, even
when other resources (such as memory, disk space, and CPU time) are widely
available.

The implementation of many network services leaves them open to a process
table attack ? that is, an attack in which the attacker fills up the target
computer's process table so that no new programs can be executed.  The
design of some network protocols actually leads the programmer into making
these mistakes.

An example of such a protocol is the finger protocol (TCP port 79). The
protocol follows this sequence:

  1. The client makes a connection to the server.
  2. The server accepts the connection, and creates a process to service 
     the request.
  3. The client sends a single line to the server consisting of the name 
     of the entity that the client wishes to finger.
  4. The server performs the necessary database lookup and sends the
     information back to the client.
  5. The server closes the connection.

To launch a process table attack, the client need only open a connection to
the server and not send any information. As long as the client holds the
connection open, the server's process will occupy a slot in the server's
process table.

On most computers, finger is launched by inetd. The authors of inetd placed
several checks into the program's source code which must be bypassed in
order to initiate a successful process attack. If the inetd receives more
than 40 connections to a particular service within 1 minute, that service is
disabled for 10 minutes. The purpose of these checks was not to protect the
server against a process table attack, but to protect the server against
buggy code that might create many connections in rapid-fire sequence.

To launch a successful process table attack against a computer running inetd
and finger, the following sequence may be followed:

  1. Open a connection to the target's finger port.
  2. Wait for 4 seconds.
  3. Repeat steps 1-2.

The attack program is not without technical difficulty. Many systems limit
the number TCP connections that may be initiated by a single process. Thus,
it may be necessary to launch the attack from multiple processes, perhaps
running on multiple computers.

We have tested a variety of network services on a variety of operating
systems. We believe that the UW imap and sendmail servers are also
vulnerable.  The UW imap contains no checks for rapid-fire connections.
Thus, it is possible to shut down a computer by opening multiple connections
to the imap server in rapid succession. With sendmail the situation is
reversed. Normally, sendmail will not accept connections after the system
load has jumped above a predefined level. Thus, to initiate a successful
sendmail attack it is necessary to open the connections very slowly, so that
the process table keeps growing in size while the system load remains more
or less constant.

We have also seen a variety of problems on BSD-based machines being used as
the attacker. When the target machine freezes or crashes, the attacker
machine sometimes crashes as well. Apparently the TCP stack does not
gracefully handle hundreds of connections to the same port on the same
machine simultaneously going into the FIN_WAIT_2 state.

There are variants of this attack:

  1. Use IP spoofing so that the incoming connections appear to come from 
     many different locations on the Internet. This makes tracking 
     considerably harder to do.
  2. Begin the attack by sending 50 requests in rapid fire to the telnet,
     rlogin and rsh ports on the target machine. This will cause inetd to 
     shut down those services on the target machine, which will deny 
     administrative access during the attack.
  3. Instead of initiating a new connection every 4 seconds, initiate one
     every minute or so. The attack slowly builds, making it more difficult 
     to detect on packet traces.

There are several ways to defend against the attack:

  1. inetd and other programs should check to see the number of free slots 
     in the process table before accepting new connections. If there is less
     than a predefined number of free slots, new connections should be 
     accepted.
  2. Alternatively, if there are more than a preset number of network daemons
     for the service running, incoming requests should be queued rather than
     serviced.
  3. Network services (such as finger) should implement timeouts. For
     example, the statement alarm(30) could be inserted into the finger
     daemon source code so that the program would stop running after 30
     seconds of execution.

  [Simson informed me over a year ago that he had discovered this attack
  and had notified many relevant operating system vendors.  To the best of
  my knowledge, no one has addressed the problem in the intervening year.
  We thus include this item in the hopes of spurring some action, or at
  least awareness and public discussion.  On the other hand, we of course
  do not recommend conducting experiments to demonstrate this flaw on
  other people's systems.  PGN]

A small article in Syssvenskan from 1999-02-15 notes that the new bridge in
Denmark over the Store Baelt (which was just opened last year) is not Y2K
safe.  Tests have shown that approx. 50% of all the systems involved
(signalling, signs, etc) will have some problem or other on 2000-01-01. But
that is not a problem, it just means that some of the trains will not be

Palo Altans watching the city's Web site yesterday morning got a bit of a
shock when a warning message told them Matadero Creek was half full, and
Adobe Creek was close to spilling over.  The messages popped up on home
computer screens because Public Works staffers holding a training session
tweaked the city's creek monitoring system as part of a demonstration.  In
reality, it was a sunny morning and the creeks were nowhere near
overflowing.  [Excerpt from "Creek Web Site Snafu Causes Alarm in P.A." by

> ...  A _much_ simpler solution ... would simply be for TROFF to 
> report any illegal commands it encountered ...

The basic problem here is that just as in C the unlikely construct "if(x=y)"
is a legal one, so ".garbage" or "'garbage" is legal in troff.  It is a
defined feature of the language that macros are invoked in the same way as
requests (commands), and that invocation of an unknown macro is permissible
and does nothing.

troff is not usually used alone, but with a macro package whose details are
unknown to the user.  That feature allows the designers of macro packages
to provide hooks: by calling an otherwise unknown macro at a certain time,
they allow the user to define an action that will occur at that time.
The same construct might also be used internally within a macro package,
e.g. to write out a footnote if there is one pending.

Several newer versions of troff, including the one that I used to maintain
for SoftQuad, do provide an option to issue a warning on invocation of an
unknown macro.  But for the backward compatibility reason that I've just
explained, for at least some users this can't be the default behavior.

Even this warning might not always be sufficient, because a user who doesn't
know that ' is special might also accidentally invoke a real request or
macro.  This is particularly true with the original troff syntax, where a
command line like .trash or 'trash (in this case the two are equivalent)
would be taken as .tr ash (i.e. the first two letters taken as the command,
and the rest the argument).  That particular command introduces character
transliteration and would turn these words into "T st psrticulsr commsnd
introduces c srscter trsnsliterstion snd would turn t ese words into".

troff *is* a tricky language to use, and this is not easily changed.

Pascal's form is indeed the "language" equivalent - the assignment
is first and then the comparrison.

I knowingly constructed (assumed ;-) ) my form to be an "intent" equivalent.
Having worked with most of the major UNIX vendors on X-Windows and the
Common Desktop Environment (CDE), and having been the architect and coder
for several now-stardard portions of each, I was trying to recall the intent
I had seen most often among the companies.

On a related note. While most of us are used to constants appearing on the
right, I've also seen where many people (not me) deliberately place
constants on the left side of an intended '==':

   if (NULL == pChar)

While it looks weird, it does help catch '=' typos via the assignment of
something to a constant; ex, NULL = pChar.

While on the topic - the original note also mentioned 'case' statements
without 'break's.  I'm 99% sure that such situations occur in the CDE code,
but once again it was intended.  In this case, I doubt even coding style
could help convey the intent, so hopefully there are comments!

All in all, my own mistrust of self documenting code probably explains why a
statistic generated by the CDE 2.0 partners (SUN, IBM and HP to name a few)
revealed that the most heavily commented libraries and executables in all of
CDE were written by me, and they weren't all // tomg XXX comments ;-)

This reminds me of a problem we encountered when I worked the PC Helpdesk at
ACS.  I came in to work one morning and there was another member of the
Helpdesk there, staring at two brand-new inoperational ThinkPads...they
couldn't get them to turn on.  He grabbed a battery that had arrived with a
package of replacement batteries the day before and had been charging in a
laptop...plugged it in to the new one, and the same thing--nothing.  He
grabbed an old battery, plugged it in, and it worked fine.  As he was about
to re-package the batteries and send them back, I noticed a "I O" marking on
one--turns out that the batteries had an on-off switch, and the new ones had
arrived switched off.  No one there had ever heard about this one, and it
was not documented anywhere.

If you're going to install a switch on something, just remember to tell
everyone involved, or it can cost a lot of time and effort chasing around
nonexistent problems....

A quick perusal of the engineering specifications of the RZ-28 family (a 2GB
3.5" SCSI disk sold in recent years by Digital, now Compaq) shows a
write-protect jumper.  Bringing this out to a switch would be trivial.  Most
RZ-28 models were actually manufactured by Seagate.  I can't speak for

A certain popular server operating system does not support read-only volumes
in its native file structure. Beyond that, the primary obstacle would appear
to be lack of market demand.

  [Followup: I looked at Seagate and Quantum's web sites, and the product
  descriptions for the high end disk drives show write protect jumpers for

Great idea: simple, cheap, effective.

Ten years ago, or a little longer, we were pushing for the same thing in
regard to computer viral programs.  I suspect that some of the discussion
can be found in the RISKS archives.  (It was about the time that PGN made an
uncharacteristic lapse and didn't catch a reference to a "write-only" hard
drive by one poster--or the two followups that quoted it.)

> Can anyone explain to me why such a scheme would be impractical or 
> unworkable?

It would cost about as much, and be as difficult to handle, as the
ubiquitous drive operating light.  A simple rewiring of the drive line
(which you can do yourself, if you have the ribbon cable schematics) makes
an effective write protect: to tell the computer that the drive is currently
protected, in order to give an error, might be a little more somplicated.
But not much.

No, I am at a loss to explain it.  I even mentioned the fact in reviewing
Western Digital's "Immunizer" system in 1992: they had this hugely
complicated, interferring, and ultimately ineffective antiviral system when
we had been asking them for years to produce a drive with a fifty cent write
protect switch.  Of course, doing the simple, effective thing would not have
helped them try to sell the 7855 controller chip ...

Subject: Re: Hacking Web/FTP Servers

I'm sure that RISKS will be deluged with answers to this particular
question but I live in a world where web servers are my main concern at
the moment, and so here goes; 

For a web/ftp site that has no dynamic content, does not change very often
*and* the administrator has physical access to a hardware *then*
read/write protection switch *may* be an answer. 

Unfortunately, in the real world most if not all web sites (not personal
home pages which are even more of a nightmare from an administration point
of view and I will not speak more of) have some form of dynamic content, and
many of these do not use database backends, but store their data on the
server's filesystem, either because they do not have access to a DB or they
do not know how to use one.

Any well made website will also be updated frequently, websites suffer badly
from bitrot like any information and a couple of weeks or a month can turn a
cool site into yet another bookmark you will never see again.

Third strike coming up... How many web sites are hosted on virtual servers
or co-located servers that have access to high bandwidth channels?

Most.

Our company doesn't want to invest in multiple T3's to be able to provide
customers with class A bandwidth and support so we use a hosting company who
provide high bandwidth, regular back ups and 24hr support with on-site
certified specialists. This does mean that we don't have physical access to
the boxes though, and calling a support engineer to 'flip a switch' is,
quite frankly, taking the piss.

Anyone who would support a physical system such as this because it is
'foolproof' is also deluding themselves, just because the data cannot be
changed without physical access does not mean that other forms of attack
will not be launched against a site. Denial of service attacks and rigged
portals can be used to kill off a site's access or use the real site to gain
information from the unsuspecting.

The final point I think must be this. If you think that you need a physical
guard on your data then maybe you're not using the security tools that come
with your system. Ensuring proper ACLs on resources is a huge step in the
right direction. The number of sites that just let web servers write
anywhere because it is more convenient for CGI writers is amazing.  Proper
guidlines for programmers about how the scripts must interact with the
webserver are also a nice bonus, tell perl coders to use the -T flag, tell
NT admins to install the most recent hotfixes for IIS to get rid of their
DATA bugs. You don't even have to be paranoid, its basic good
administration.

The risk is broader than he suggests.  Uncertainty whether systems are

social engineering as well as technical attacks: "We're fixing a critical

security for a while so we can fix it?"

One sobering though is that it may be weeks or months before the victims

I've been wondering about a different kind of fraud, which doesn't even require

When you get the statement, complain to the bank that you didn't make the
withdrawal. When they describe their records, repeat that you never made

The problem for the bank, of course, is that proving that there wasn't a bug
