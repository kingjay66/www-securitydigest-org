Subject: Mars Climate Observer failure

The $125M Mars Climate Observer probe had seemingly been approaching Mars on
target, but somehow managed to get within about 60 km of Mars -- rather than
the planned 160 km -- an altitude that was 25 km too close for the probe to
survive.  This too-close approach is believed to have resulted from
erroneous commands sent to the probe, although there are now suspicions that
the probe had been off course since the last previous correction on 15 Sep.

  [Mars has been a tough target.  The Soviets lost both Phobos I (faulty
  remote software upgrade, 1988) and Phobos II (bad antenna realignment),
  and another mission that was destroyed on launch (1996), after the earlier
  loss of an attempted Mars orbiter in 1971.  The U.S. lost a 1993 Observer,
  and more recently the Mars Rover Pathfinder (RISKS-19.49 to 56).  There
  have of course been some successes, with the Viking landers (1970s) and
  Pathfinder (1997).]

Subject: UK rail disaster inquiry: driver had his feet up!

The driver of the high-speed passenger train that crashed in 1997 killing 7
and injuring 150 had been seen earlier on that trip with both feet up on the
dashboard of his cab, leading to speculation that he had weighted down the
dead-man's switch.  He later drove through two warning signals and a red
stop signal before colliding with a freight train crossing the line in front
of him at Southall, in West London, en route to Paddington Station in
London.  The inquiry has now finally begun.  The inquiry heard that the
train's Automatic Warning System (AWS) -- which sounds a klaxon when the
train goes through danger lights -- had been switched off after apparently
malfunctioning earlier in the day.  The train was also fitted with Automatic
Train Protection (ATP), but this was also switched off because the driver
who had been in charge of the train earlier in the day was not trained to
use it; that system would have automatically prevented the train from
running the stop signal.  Great Western was already fined a record 1.5M
pounds for a breach of the Health and Safety Act.  [Source: BBC website, 20

Subject: AT&T nationwide cellphone service goes down, 3000 miles from Floyd

I am an AT&T customer on the Digital One plan, which sells me a cellphone
that works nationwide with no roaming or long-distance charges.  The problem
is that the system is not robust.  If local phone circuits stop working in
particular places, the AT&T network won't complete calls to phones whose
number happens to be there, even to cellphones that aren't anywhere near the
affected area.

My cellphone number is in the 914 318 exchange (New York [Westchester] metro
area).  I am physically located today in San Francisco.  I can make calls,
but nobody can call me.  When I make a call to the cellphone from a San
Francisco land-line that has AT&T long distance service, AT&T routes my call
through New York, which results in a recording saying that the hurricane
makes it impossible to complete my call.  Why does AT&T route my call
through New York?  Because its long-distance network is too stupid to
realize that it's calling an AT&T mobile exchange, and dump the call into a
local (California) AT&T mobile switch, which could provide direct routing to
wherever the phone actually is.

When I call my cellphone from itself, I still get the recording!  The local
cellular switch is too stupid to complete outgoing calls to this number
locally, even though it knows how to handle incoming calls for this phone
number!

There's an efficiency issue about why every call to the cellphone should go
to New York and then to the phone's location, but much more important is the
robustness issue.  What other parts of AT&T's network will take out my
cellphone if they go down?  Some national switching center in tornado
territory in the Midwest?  Some billing center under a blizzard in Canada?

I hope that as AT&T redesigns its network for IP-based telephony, it will
address some of these issues.

John

PS; One of the other little things AT&T doesn't tell you will break until
after you notice it: their voicemail system won't answer your calls if you
roam into an analog cellular system!  They just ring and ring and ring.  I
think this is true even if your cellphone is powered off, if the last place
it was on was analog.

PPS: I hope somebody else in RISKS is covering why it's been days since San
Franciscans can call New York, at least on AT&T circuits.  Are any of the
other carriers doing any better?  I'd try a few, but none of them put their
prefix code in their ads in the brand-new Pac Bell phone book!

Subject: 1 Oct 1999 as a Y2K problem date?

Add 1 Oct 1999 to your list of dangerous dates.  My Visa bill (which just
arrived) is due in early October.  The "payment due date" field is
apparently too small, so the due date is listed as 0/05/1999.  Presumably,
the leading digit "1" was dropped.

Why didn't this occur last year?  They changed from using a 2-digit year to
a 4-digit year in April of this year, and apparently did not realize that
they would have to increase the size of the field.

   [The problem evidently is not at Visa, but rather at David's issuing bank.  
   It appears to be a format error in the statement printer rather than a
   Visa programming problem.  PGN]

For one big reason: This number wasn't present during those phases.  One
modern space vehicles, these controller gains and constants are dependent on
exact vehicle configuration, so they are in file(s) that are loaded into the
vehicle during the launch campaign, and require some verification process
independent of the original FSW T&V.

In the case of this Centaur problem, the number was specified properly out
of the analysis and development group - it was during the manual entry of
those numbers into the load file that the error was made.  Subsequent
verification was not detailed enough to make the error obvious (like launch
did), but it was enough to give a few engineers pause.  None of them pursued
it with sufficient vigor.

>From: Gisle Hannemyr <lunchbreak@hannemyr.com>

> How technically feasible is it for a macro virus to disable the

It's utterly trivial; one or two lines of VBA (Visual Basic for
Applications, the language that macros are written in in Office'97 and
above) can adjust just about any of the adjustable parameters in Word (or
any other Office app), including the automatic "this document contains
macros" warning.

But of course the virus has to *run* to be able to execute those one or two
lines!  So if you *never* allow a virus (or any other malicious program) to
run, it can't turn off the built-in macro detector (or do anything else).
On the other hand, if you accidentally let a virus or Trojan horse run even
once, all bets are off, and your system may now have the virus detection
turned off.  Of course, you can always check; go into the relevant options
screen, and make sure "Macro virus protection" is turned on.

Note also that there have been a few flaws discovered that might allow a
malicious macro to run without warning, even if you did have the macro virus
protection turned on (see http://www.microsoft.com/security/ for recent
alerts and so on).  These have not been generally exploited, but if someone
did successfully exploit one, just once, against your system, it might have
turned the macro-virus protection off.

Subject: Massive hole in NSI web-based e-mail

You may be familiar with Network Solutions' recent roll-out of web-based
e-mail for domain owners - whether they liked it or not - and subsequent
notes that the initial passwords assigned to those accounts were trivially
guessable.  Unfortunately for NSI, this was not their biggest mistake.

Try this URL:

http://mail.dotcomnow.com/signup/poll/root

Congratulations, you can now log in as root.  Or this one:

http://mail.dotcomnow.com/signup/poll/postmaster

You can now log in as postmaster.  This comes about because at the last
stage of the new account creation process - after it's checked to make sure
you aren't duplicating someone else's account, and created your new one - it
gives you a URL with the username (in cleartext) and password (encoded), so
that you can jump right in without logging in.  Unfortunately, as you can
see here, if you replace that last word in the URL with _any_ account name
whatsoever, it will still give you a log-in link with username and password
present - you can also jump right in to _that_ account without needing to
know the password.

And remember, hundreds of thousands of domain owners just received these
accounts, involuntarily.  Who do you want to be today?  Any domain owner...

Subject: An easy 'out' for dotcomnow.com accounts (Re: NSI blows it again)

In regards to the massive publicity blow-up which thousands of domain-name
holders were notified that e-mail accounts had been set up for them, with
login information in plaintext and easily-guessable passwords; I received
NSI's spam the evening the scandal broke, apparently identical to the one
which started the brouhaha but without the e-mail account information. Since
Slashdot's report implied that accounts had been set up even for people who
hadn't been notified, I panicked. So had every other owner of an account in
the .com TLD.

I poked around a little. After deciding that there was no account
established unambiguously on my behalf, and no security holes compromising
anything other than the mail account itself (such as a means to modify
domain registration info) I decided not to pursue further. The free e-mail
service may have been implemented in stages and halted when the reactions
began.

What I did find, though, was the Terms of Service contract at
http://mail.dotcomnow.com/signup/name (one has to contrive a name to reach
the ToS, but can choose to decline the contract after reading it) which
states the following:

   G. MODIFICATIONS TO AGREEMENT. [...] You may terminate this
   Agreement at any time by providing us with notice by e-mail
   addressed to support@nsimail.com or by United States mail
   addressed to Free Web Mail Comments, 505 Huntmar Park Drive,
   Herndon, VA 20170-5139.

The agreement, in this case, refers to the contract to which people
unwittingly given free e-mail accounts have been unwitting signatories to.
(This could lead to the common dilemma of vulnerability to
misrepresentation, of course, if somebody decides to arbitrarily cut off
somebody else's account in use.)

While Slashdot, with its vast readership, is responsible for fanning the
flames of panic and providing misleading info, NSI is certainly the
guiltiest party, in having come up with such a promotion in the first place.

AjD

Long postscript:

Incidentally, NSI offers various free and pay services, all built around
and promoted using 'dotcom', in keeping with their slogan, 'the dot com
people (tm)'. This led, among other things, to confusion among Slashdot
readership -- demonstrated by irate people reporting to Slashdot their
efforts to cancel 'dot com mail' (fee-based) accounts which don't exist.
Instead of linking to http://mail.dotcomnow.com/, the service's front door
(which apparently had worked through the peak of the frenzy and is not
hosted by NSI), Slashdot's news posting linked to an announcement at
http://www.netsol.com/dotcomnowmail/ and to Network Solution's homepage.
During the time NSI's servers were swamped by the slashdot effect, they
produced either Page Not Found errors or redirected visitors to NSI's
homepage, which promotes 'dot com mail' by name but not dotcomnow.

Adding further confusion to people who might try to guess at URLs and work
around the traffic, http://www.dotcomnow.com/ links to a placeholder page
hosted by NSI, while http://mail.dotcomnow.com/ is the service's proper
homepage. No links on the dotcomnow.com pages provide constructive
information on who is providing the service, and of the five links on the
homepage, three link to other NSI-hosted dotcom* sites promoting marketing
services fuzzily related to dotcomnow.com.

From: Lenny Foner <foner@media.mit.edu>
Subject: More data on the NSI spam: acct names and how to change passwords

I've got several additional pieces of information about the recent NSI spam.
Executive summary: You probably have accounts you don't know about, and it's
impossible to change their passwords securely anyway.

(a) A couple of RISKS subscribers told me, after my plea, that the way to
actually get my password changed was to go to mail.dotcomnow.com (rather
than directly to the URL present in the spam), and change it there.  My
thanks to these contributors; this worked.  Even better, none of the RISKS
subscribers who might have noticed the gaffe in my previous message (in
which I inadvertently revealed the account name) took advantage of the
situation to change the password -for- me...

(b) The forms for logging in, and for changing one's password, are not
encrypted -at all-, e.g., NSI is not using SSL in any way to secure the
information in transit.  While not as big a breach as is spamming millions
of people with trivially-guessable passwords that will sit in filesystems,
it is still an annoying breach; it means anyone who cares about packet
sniffers can't really change their password to anything hard to find,
either.

(c) I did some checking around, which is easy, because I have a very unusual
last name.  In fact, basically all the other Foners in the country, if not
the world, are relatives of mine.

The original NSI spam to me claimed that my account name was foner3.
However, foner, foner1, and foner2 were also valid accounts, all with
passwords of the form "<foo>nsi".  [If I've inadvertently changed the
password on the account for a relative of mine, the chances are excellent,
based on past experience, that they read RISKS as well, so let me know,
okay?]  Interestingly enough, I am definitely the very first Foner to have
ever created any records in the DNS (by many years), so it's interesting
that the only one that got any mail was foner3.  (And most of my e-mail
addresses, even from 20 years back, still get to me, so it's not likely that
they got lost in transit.)

On the other hand, I own two domains, for which the NIC handle is LNF2.  (I
also used to administer a domain, ten years ago, for which my NIC handle is
LNF1.  I have never been able, in a couple of years of trying, to get NSI to
actually merge these two records---they seem to have absolutely no procedure
for handling this.  Filling out their forms causes automated bounces;
"scribbling" all over the margins with a text editor (in the rightmost
columns, etc) saying "PLEASE HAVE A HUMAN BEING READ THIS AND DEAL WITH IT"
causes the forms to be black-holed.  Thus, there is now a dangling pointer
in their database about who actually administers this ten-year-old domain
for a company that I used to work at, and there are two similar but
conflicting records about how to contact me, one of them wrong by ten years.
Typical NSI.  I also find it curious that domains have last-modified and
created-on-date information, but NIC handles only have last-modified.)

Neither LNF1 nor LNF2 are valid e-mail accounts in the dotcommail system; I
just tried them.  I have no idea why there are -four- listings for my last
name in the system.  (I tried foner0 through foner7 and then ran out of
enthusiasm for the project; I"m reasonably sure they only went up to foner3.
There are 6 Foners listed in the NIC WHOIS database, so that ain't it,
either.)

-However-, "yenta" (with password "yentansi") -was- a valid account; I own
YENTA.ORG.  On the other hand, I own ECM.ORG, and "ecm" was -not- a valid
account.  (Neither were yenta1, ecm1, etc.)

P.S.  Needless to say, my passwords for all of these accounts are now
concatenations of various unprintable epithets relating to the ancestry and
intelligence of NSI and its employees.  And if anyone ever receives any mail
from me from any of these accounts, you must presume that it is nonetheless
a forgery unless you have confirmation through some other channel that it is
not.

Subject: Final bit of info re NSI spam

I just discovered (after sending the previous mail) that the way to figure
out who the account thinks it's for is to log in, go to the Preferences
page, and then go to the Personalities page.  This tells me, for example,
that my "duplicates" are relatives: "foner" is Carl, "foner1" and "foner2"
is Joel (twice? hmm), and "foner3" is me---and that "yenta" was Larry Yenta
(oops!).  I'm sending them all mail explaining what happened...

Interestingly enough, they're all of the form "Leonard foner", e.g., the
last name is not capitalized.

P.S.  Anyone want to hazard a guess as to why "whois yenta" shows
Larry Yenta's entry, and yenta.com (not mine), but not yenta.org
(which -is- mine)?

  [I've a yen ta duck that one.  But in response to someone else's query,
  a comment from Lauren Weinstein leads me to suggest that you might try
    http://www.geektools.com/cgi-bin/whois.cgi
  , which can give you non-NSI domain assignments as well.  It says it 
  is a "Work in progress", but it appears to be a valuable one.

Subject: Re: NSI blows it again (Foner, RISKS-20.58)

Lenny Foner describes the recent Network Solutions spam and free e-mail
account debacle. On that same topic, CNET reports that "e-mail hosting
provider Critical Path has acknowledged a serious security hole that
compromised accounts within services offered by a number of customers,
including Network Solutions, the dominant domain name registrar."

  "The hole is similar to one that plagued Microsoft's Hotmail last
  month by allowing access to a user's account without requiring a
  password first. The more recent breach, which Critical Path
  confirmed yesterday, comes as Network Solutions (NSI) is offering
  new services such as free e-mail to hold on to customers who may be
  lured away by new competitors.

  "Critical Path, which provides behind-the-scenes resources for
  activating accounts on NSI's new service, said the problem affected
  other free e-mail clients but declined to name them."

See "http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-121667.html" for details.

This ill-implemented Network Solutions promotion illustrates a larger risk:
How competent is Network Solutions? The RISKS archives are filled with
examples of Network Solutions screw-ups (see [1] through [5], below). Of
course, one can argue that these are isolated problems, and that Network
Solutions is doing a relatively good job day-to-day. However, my personal
experience with them in recent years has left me unimpressed with their
competence. I have had problems with their PGP key server (most recently,
they somehow lost my PGP key, causing my submitted change requests to fail
mysteriously until I determined that I had to register the key again),
trouble with their telephone support (which I've never found to be
particularly helpful, on those rare occasions I've managed to get through
at all), and a few apparently lost change requests. And as for their
customer service, I'm highly unimpressed: While attempting to resolve such
problems, I've found it nearly impossible to get in touch with an actual
person (competent or otherwise), whether by phone or by e-mail.

Yahoo has the unaudited income statement for Network Solutions, for the
first half of this year. (See http://biz.yahoo.com/fin/19990816/nsol/ti.html)
It lists their gross revenues at (US) $85,631,000 (with a net profit of
$10,593,000 for the same six months). That's more than double the revenue
for the same period last year. Some analysts are projecting that Network
Solutions will grow 40% over the next three years. With that kind of rosy
business outlook and current revenue stream, it's a little difficult to
understand why their customer service is so poor--other than their
all-but-monopoly status as a domain registrar.

I'm encouraged that the Commerce Department has been experimenting with
competition for Network Solutions (see, for example,
http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-116634.html). Hopefully, competition
will also cause them to improve their service--or, at least, provide
customers with workable alternatives.
