Subject: 2 Women Accused in Sale of Adoption Information

Abstracted from an AP item in the Buffalo News, May 2, 1993:

Two women accused of selling confidential information about adoptions have
pleaded innocent to computer trespass, grand larceny, and other charges.
State police and Department of Health officials allege that one of the women,
a departmental employee, looked up confidential adoption records in state
computers, then passed them onto the other defendant.  The other defendant,
who ran an adoption group called Birth Parents Network, then allegedly sold
the information for $800 a listing to people seeking their birth parents or
children.

  Comment: It is notoriously difficult to break the sealed records in adoption
  cases. Many people use private detectives to find out what the court doesn't
  want them to know. Why not an end run around the records, and, at $800, it's
  probably cheaper than the detective.

Subject: Caller-ID mistakes

The other evening, I received a number from an upset woman.  It appears that
her caller-id box told her she had just received a call from my number.  The
only call I had made that evening yielded me a pizza, and the number did not
resemble hers.  I did not ask her to described the call, because she seemed
upset.  But I gather I would not have wanted to be accused of making it.

Anybody know whether this happens often?  Does the caller-id report include an
error check?  Are all boxes required to verify the check?

Subject: A RISK of Mailing Lists?

Appended to the end of this message is an announcement I received today.
There's a new mailing list in town, the Risk Management and Insurance Mailing
list. The new mailing list is named RISK.

Perhaps this is an example of a RISK associated with the growing use of
mailing lists.

I wonder how many people, intending to subscribe to a mailing list version of
the RISKS digest, will accidentally subscribe to the RISK mailing list.

In the case of a watch it doesn't matter whether it is analogue or digital,
for most people most of the time a quarter hour counter will do.  In fact the
minute hand is really not needed and was omitted from early clocks, the time
between the hours was estimated.

In the case of a speedometer the speeds to which one is driving (eg usually
the limit) do matter.  I was involved in research (yes the evil deed of
getting real data) for Ford in Britain and we found that a digital, numeric
readout, even in poor seven segment characters was uniformly at least as good
and most times better than an analogue display.  We found this effect in
photographic presentations, a simulator and on the road with a $100,000
prototype.  We knew from the "ergonomics" literature that an analogue display
was supposed to be better for check reading and estimation but we failed to
find what we expected even though the tests were sometimes biased to find out
if such an effect occurred.  Furthermore, older people preferred this display
because the numbers were now so large that it was not necessary to focus on
them as much as was necessary to see a needle (especially at night).  The time
taken to interpret the numeric display was "swamped" by the ease of reading it
allowing people to look back at the road during the interpretation time.  When
we presented the results to a conference the German and Japanese auto
researchers rushed back to their labs to do the research which only we had
"bothered" to do.  Never assume that "common sense" is enough when people's
lives may be at stake.

Subject: Census imposters invading Cary

I found this article in the newspaper last week.  It's obvious that the story
describes an attempt to "fish for information" on us, but I would like to know
what questions you netters think these "census takers" might be asking.  The
simplest answer is that they are casing the joint to find out how many VCR's
and how much jewelry people own, when they are at home, etc.  But is there any
other data that would have less tangible risks?  SSNs, for example?
George Entenman  ge@mcnc.org

  Census imposters invading Cary, by Beverly Brown, Staff writer
  The News and Observer, Saturday, May 1, 1993, Page 7B [Abstracted by PGN]

Cary [NC] - Beware of nosy people at your door claiming to be census workers.
They probably aren't.  Police Chief David Fortson said several residents have
complained about people identifying themselves as census employees and
proceeding to ask questions.

Eighty legitimate census workers - carrying red, white and blue identification
cards - won't start going door-to-door until May 20, when the town begins
conducting a special census.  Cary, at odds with the Census Bureau over the
town's 1990 census, commissioned a special head-count last year.  The latest
census says the fast-growing town has a few more than 43,000 residents.  But
the town estimates that at least 48,000 people call Cary home.  At stake are
millions of dollars in state funding, allocated on the basis of population.
For a new count, which will involve a week-long canvass, census workers will
limit their questions to name, age, race, sex, national origin and
relationship to the homeowner.

Fortson said the imposters most likely are opportunists, using public
knowledge about the town's forthcoming count as a chance to fish for
information.  "There are all kinds of things going on in terms of scams," he
said.  "Perhaps this is another way for folks to pull off a scam.  I just
don't know."

Subject: Computer Problem reveals tax details

"The Scotsman", 6th May, reports an incident affecting possibly as many
as "a couple of thousand" households in East Kilbride, near Glasgow.
Residents have received information on council tax rebates (for low 
income and invalidity benefit claimants) relating to their neighbours.

Apparently, the computer "broke down" midway through printing the 900,000
bills being issued, and after the computer was restarted, the problem
occurred. Apparently, the rebate information on the FRONT of the bill was
correct, but that the calculation on the BACK related to the next
household (apparently the bills are issued in order of address). 

Presumably, when the computer crashed, it ejected one half-printed bill, and
proceeded to pair the front and back pages wrongly for the remainder of the
run.

A council official said that most families would not be directly
identified [though if you know that they live next door....]. The only 
names in bills would be those of "non-dependents" such as lodgers.

  [We had an almost identical case a few years back.  PGN]

Subject:      Videoconferencing Bridge Likes Muscular Lungs

In the April 1993 issue of the MIT Information Systems magazine there is a
description of a videoconferencing system.  Apparently, in a multi-site
conference, each site must call a bridge, or hub, which then acts as the
traffic controller for transmission to and from the participating sites. The
risk is in the bridge design:

  The bridge relies on voice activation to determine which site to show
  more or less on the principle that whoever talks the loudest gets seen"

Does this system contravene the Americans with Disabilities Act? I never
knew that lung power would some day make me more visible.

This text was forwarded to me by a friend and professional colleague in the

AIS BBS Capture log.
 
To:  all interested parties, especially Americans who may wish to ask
relevant questions of relevant people.
 
Capture log from a BBS that claims to be run by the US Treasury Department,
Bureau of the Public Debt. Notice - I have not verified that the US government
is actually running this BBS, only that the BBS claims that it is.
 
The capture was made live. I have cut out parts where the same area was
visited twice, and the information is identical. Also cut out, is any
information that could lead to the caller being identified, as the caller
wishes to retain privacy. If indeed this is being run by the US Government,
the caller would not wish to be harassed by that organisation.
 
Also omitted are the "More" prompts for paging the display. And, after the
first few displays of the main menu, some of those have also been omitted for
brevity.
 
The file 27-ASM.ZIP was downloaded, to check that there really were source
codes. In fact, there were mostly recompilable disassemblies, some good, some
bad. I've included, at the end of this file, the beginning of 512.ASM, a
disassembly of Number of the Beast. But I've only included the header, the
first couple of instructions (discover Dos version) and the end (the '666').
All the meat of the code, I've omitted for brevity, and because this capture
is likely to become publicly available.

Subject: Pyramids in space (Mehlman, RISKS-14.57)

: The pyramids are a poor example to bring into the argument about manned 
: space exploration.  They cost more than just money.

It's not just cost.  After all, manned space exploration costs more than just
money, too.  It's that, with a few thousand years of hindsight, pyramids
*were* a remarkably stupid thing to do with those resources.  If I thought
that manned space flight was "like" building the pyramids, I'd immediately say
"flush it".  I mean, was it *really* sensible to build those structures, when
the only thing that the heirs of all this effort find practical to do with it
is to mine the dressing stones from the surface, recover the burial goods, and
promote tourism income?

Hmmmmmm.  Do you suppose there were those who said "well, just look at the
technological spinoffs!  We now can pile large stone slabs up with joints you
can't fit a knife into!  We can build structures of enormous size with
incredibly accurate right angles!"?

Bogus then.  Bogus now.

Don't get me wrong, I don't suppose that there are no adequate justifications
for manned space exploration.  It's just that the argument that "it'll turn
out to be just as good an investment as the pyramids" is a remarkably poor
one, roughly like saying that "He's evewy bit as good a wabbit hunter as Elmer
Fudd."

So what's the computer risk here?  Perhaps the oldest of them all.  The risk
of being impressed by spinning tape drives or blinking lights or neat rows of
numbers on printout.  Which is, after all, a variant of the very human risk of
being impressed by appearance rather than substance.

Subject: Re: Epilepsy and video games

There have been a few postings in the past on alleged pathological (esp.
neurological) conditions induced by playing video games (e.g., Nintendo).
Apparently, there have been reported several cases of "photosensitive
epilepsy", due to the flashing of some patterns and the strong attention of
the (young) players.  One poster to comp.risks reported some action from the
British Government.

A quick search in a database reported the following two published
references:

1. E.J. Hart, Nintendo epilepsy, in New England J. of Med., 322(20), 1473

I would appreciate if someone could post (or e-mail) any reference to

Even though I'm personally in favor of sending men into space, I don't
think they are required or desirable for every mission, and this recent
example just cited, if anything, is hardly a strong case in favor of manned
missions.  Think: if you hadn't had the men there to bump the plastic part
and break it in the first place, you wouldn't have had any problem that
needed a man to fix.  You also need to be careful not to read too much
into the "cleverness/ingenuity" issues: a man on the ground could have
been just as clever and directed a fairly simple robot arm to insert
the felt tip pen.  There are examples where having a man there saved the
mission, but this wasn't one of them, and economically you'd be a lot
farther ahead if you had twice as many unmanned missions (costing half
as much) even if 25% of them did fail.

If you want some hard facts, consider the amount that we have spent
recently trying to get a working toilet, and how much time was spent
trying to fix it.  Without men there, you don't need toilets.

Direct mail marketers are, of course, interested in "targeting" their mailings
to recipients in known categories such as Porsche owners or toad collectors.
I have long felt that if you request that the Direct Marketing Association put
your name on the "no unsolicited material" database, you would eventually be
categorized as a person interested in privacy issues and mailbox pollution.

  China executes hacker over #122,000 [UK pounds] theft

  The Chinese government said this week it had executed convicted hacker

  Biao, who worked as an accountant at the Agricultural Bank of China,
  embezzled more that #122,000 [UK pounds] over three months in 1991 by

Subject: Re: Evading 1-900 blocking (Carr, RISKS-14.57)

I think that if the owner of a phone line wanted to communicate with sexually
explicit services (whether 900 numbers or anything else), he or she should be
required to request, in writing, that those services be enabled.  (Hey, the
phone company could charge for the service!)  If you've got kids and don't
want to talk dirty on the phone yourself, you do nothing.  If you don't have
kids, then you can sign up.  If you have kids and sign up, then it is up to
you to deal with keeping your kids out of it.  But the bottom line would be
that services would be obligated to reject calls from any line that had not
explicitly requested access to such services.

>In my opinion, they were trying to blame technology for a social problem...

There are technological issues here.  My own son got involved with
one of these "services" recently, and am glad to hear that others are
upset about it.  A couple of points:

(1) When you call this supposedly free 800-number, you don't have
    to "leave your phone number", the company gets it automatically
    when you call.  You get a recorded number telling you to hang up.
    You then get an automatic, collect callback.

(2) The callback apparently doesn't require any explicit response to
    enable the collect call.  If you stay on the line for more than
    a few seconds, you are charged.  There is no mention of
    how much the call will cost.

To answer your last question:

(1) There is nothing wrong with "talking about sex."  However, I
    do think that there is something wrong with adults describing
    explicit sex acts to a preteen child.  We do discuss sex with our
    kids, and assume that they discuss it with their friends (in terms
    rather different than we do with them :-) ), but I certainly
    wouldn't take any of them to a hardcore porno movie.

(2) There is pretty much a consensus in our society that children should
    not have free access to sexually explicit materials.  I may be
    overstating this, but consider what would happen to an "adult"
    bookstore owner who sold materials to minors (or at least young
    minors).  I feel that anyone distributing such materials, whether
    in a store, by mail, or electronically, has the obligation to take
    reasonable steps to ensure that the recipient is of "reasonable" age.

(3) We will take responsibility for what our son knew he was doing.
    called, that we (and he) will take responsibility for.  (He called some
    other, regular long distance numbers with recorded messages, and has
    repaid us for them.) However, I am not happy about this end run around
    900-number blocking that turns a supposedly-free phone call into a
    charged call. 

(The company in question did eliminate the charge, by the way, when
informed that they had made a collect, obscene phone call to a minor
child.  I kind of wish that they hadn't been so accommodating.  I was
ready to make a very big stink.)

An interesting side effect to all of this.  Since our little incident, I
have been getting some very unusual mail, not even in a "pain brown
wrapper."  I had never realized that calling a 1-800 number could put
you onto a mailing list!
