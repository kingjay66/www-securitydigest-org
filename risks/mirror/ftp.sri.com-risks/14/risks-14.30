COMPUTER CHEATS TAKE CADSOFT'S BAIT

Employees of IBM, Philips, the German federal interior ministry and the
federal office for the protection of the constitution are among those who
unwittingly 'turned themselves in' when a German computer software company
resorted to an undercover strategy to find out who was using illegal copies of
one of its programs.

Hundreds of customers accepted Cadsoft's offer of a free demonstration program
that, unknown to them, searched their computer hard disks for illegal copies.
Where the search was successful, a message appeared on the monitor screen
inviting the customer to print out and return a voucher for a free handbook of
the latest version of the program. However, instead of a handbook the users
received a letter from the Bavarian-based software company's lawyers.

Since the demonstration program was distributed last June about 400 people
have returned the voucher, which contained coded information about the type of
computer and the version of the illegally copied Cadsoft program being used.
Cadsoft is now seeking damages of at least DM6,000 (ECU3,06E2) each from the
illegal users.

Cadsoft's tactics are justified by manager Rudolf Hofer as a necessary defence
against pirate copying. The company had experienced a 30% drop since 1991 in
sales of its successful Eagle design program, which retails at DM2,998. In
contrast, demand for a DM25 demo version, which Cadsoft offered with the
handbook of the full version, had jumped, indicating that people were
acquiring the program from other sources.

Although Cadsoft devised its plan with the help of lawyers, doubts have been
raised about the legal acceptability of this type of computer detective work.
In the case of government offices there is concern about data protection and
official secrets. The search program may also have had side-effects that
caused other files to be damaged or lost.  Cadsoft is therefore preparing
itself for what could be a long legal battle with some customers.  So far it
has reached out-of-court agreement with only about a quarter of those who
incriminated themselves.

Superior Court ruling upholds `Wizards' ban, by Christina Kirby

  A SUPERIOR court judge has upheld the Milpitas Unified School
District's 2-year-old ban on the Wizards spelling game.  The ruling was
handed down last Friday.
  The computer game was banned in 1990 by the school board following
complaints from parents that it promoted satanic worship.
  Teachers, seeking to reverse the ban, argued that it infringed on
their rights to choose teaching materials, and broke laws prohibiting
state agencies, such as school districts, from supporting any religion.
  The court ruled that the school district had acted within its authority and
had not violated the California constitution by banning the game.
  "With all due respect, we don't agree with the court's decision," said
Catherine Porter, an attorney representing the teachers.  "Based on the
California constitution, we do believe that we provided significant evidence
to show that the purpose and effect of the ban was religious and not secular."
  Pleased by the ruling, Milpitas Superintendent Jack Mackay said, "We
always thought the board was acting within its authority to maintain a
secular environment."
  Porter said Monday that the teachers would be discussing whether or
not to appeal the decision.

Subject: "Two charged with computer fraud in credit scam"

Source:  St Pete Times, 1/26/93, pg 3B, Tim Roche

A personnel supervisor "who knew the ins and outs of a computer system that
managed charger accounts for thousands of jewelry store customers along the
Eastern Seaboard" and a former co-worker worked a scam using the supervisors
ability to alter the computers database, illustrating the risks of:

  - inadequate controls within the computer system
  - retail store policy shortcomings
  - the procedure by which they let users who have had their card stolen
    continue to charge purchases
  - flaws in the system accountability

"Using computer passwords of other employees, detectives said, Benjamin
Francois was able to alter customer records and list a credit card as lost or
stolen.  Then his friend, John Wise, would appear at a jewelry store and claim
to be the customer whose credit card was missing.  By store policy, Wise only
was required to give sales clerks a name, Social Security number and a secret
code that would allow customers whose cards were lost or stolen to continue
charging merchandise.  "If the clerk asked to see some identification, Wise
would explain ...  he had no photo to prove he was the customer, but he would
give the clerk the secret code Francois had obtained from the computer."

Affected between June 2nd and last September were:
  - jewelry stores in Tampa, Orlando, Palm Beach and Altamonte Springs FL
  - Jewelers Financial Services, which ran accounts for:
    . Zales Jewelers, Bailey Banks & Biddle Jewelers, Gordons Jewelers

Francois was able to delete the references to stolen or lost cards on the
charge accounts after the purchases were made.  The two men were arrested
after a tip in November led police investigators to "verify the mainframe
database" records.

Of particular interest: system controls allow Francois to manipulate the
database, then hide the activity so that, apparently, the real customers were
not billed.  If the report is correct, it was the November tip and not any
system controls that revealed the thefts.  Apparently the charges were allowed
to fall into some sort of accounting black hole.

Subject: Bible belt broadcast bungle

Heard this on the radio this morning: a major Christian radio network is
alerting its member stations to check their latest shipments of religious
compact discs before airing them.  It seems that some other CDs were
mislabelled at the factory and shipped along with the religious ones.
Unfortunately the itinerant CDs were by the Dead Kennedys.  A spokesman for
the radio network said, "This is what happens whenever people get around
machines."  The CBS newsreader, with masterful understatement, said, "The Dead
Kennedys CDs included songs such as, `I Kill Children,' which some Christian
listeners may not find inspirational."

Subject: Phone Fraud numbers

The major telecomm carriers are reporting that 1992 was a bad year for the
phone baddies intent on ripping off phone service from corporations. Sprint
reported fraud claims by its business customers dived 96 percent, to $670,000,
or $1,350 per incident compared to an average loss of $35,000 in 1991. AT&T
says fraud claims made to it dropped about 88 percent and MCI says it has also
seen a drop in claims. In other words, 1992 losses were a far cry from the $1
billion to $3 billion a year claimed as losses in past years. The major reason
for the drop: customer awareness

Subject: Re: EM Radiation (and cell phones) (Menon, RISKS-14.29)

The issues surrounding the topic of possible negative health effects from
cellular phone use are going to be among the hottest (no pun intended) in
coming years.

There are no definitive studies that fully address the complexities of the
situation, especially in view of increasing circumstantial evidence that
non-ionizing radiation may have more biological effects than previously
thought.

It's true that walkie-talkies, ham radios, etc. have been around for
many years--but there are some potentially significant differences
with cellular phones:

1) Most walkie-talkie, police radios, ham radios, etc. are operated
   in a push-to-talk mode.  You're only transmitting when you're
   actually talking.  Cell phones transmit continuously, so exposure
   is continuous during calls.

2) Cell phones operate at higher frequencies than most common
   service or ham radios (common hand-held ham radios, for
   example, usually go no higher than the 440 Mhz band.  Cell
   phones operate in the 800-900 Mhz region, which puts them
   just about in the microwave range.

Recently there have been a number of concerns raised about microwave exposure
to the operators of police radar units.  We're talking longer exposure and
higher frequencies in the radar case--but nobody knows where the "thresholds"
might be for exposure to possibly show effects in some persons.  The bottom
line is that the higher the frequency, the more "energetic" the effects.

In at least a couple of the cases of persons accusing cell phones of causing
tumors, part of their evidence is the shape and direction of tumor
growth--they apparently are aligned with the antenna and growing inward from
the outside.  Of course, this says nothing about cause and effect--but it has
to at least be considered.

It's true that cell phones use quite low power.  But a little power packs a
bigger "punch" at these frequencies, and with the antenna right next to the
head the *field strength* (which matters more than the absolute power) can be
quite high (inverse square law applies).

Concerns about health effects from hand-held radios have been around for a
long time.  But with the millions of people using continuously transmitting,
ultra high frequency units who never did before, some new dimensions are added
to the picture--and they are definitely worthy of serious consideration.

By the way, not all cellular systems are created equal when it comes to
radiation exposure.  The new CDMA digital system, for example, throttles back
the power from the portable unit depending on how close you are to the cell
site--the site transmitter sends a signal back to the handheld controlling the
power level.  The main reason for doing this is to drastically increase
battery life, but it has the additional benefit of reducing overall exposure
as well.

	"We've had walkie talkies (ok - two way radios) for years with
	no perceivable or admitted risk to the health of users."

Not so.  Long term (over 20 years) use of two-way radios by police officers
has been linked to higher incidences of glaucoma.  This is one reason why the
transmitter unit is now worn on the belt, with the microphone pinned to the
lapel.

(This means that the transmitter irradiates the gonads instead of the
eyeballs ... a possible new risk?)

Well, it's worse than I thought.  GAO has been migrating to the new Government

Subject: The Federal Criteria for Information Technology Security review

The **PRELIMINARY DRAFT** of the U.S. Federal Criteria for Information
Technology Security (FC) (which will eventually replace the "Orange Book") is
available on-line.  The files are located on both the NIST Computer Security
Bulletin Board and on the NCSC's DOCKMASTER computer system.  DOCKMASTER has
the FC available in UNIX compressed postscript format, while the NIST BBS has
the FC available in PKZIP postscript format.  When printed out, both volumes
of the document total approximately 280 pages double-sided.  By the first week
of February, the FC (without the figures) should be available in ASCII format
at both sites.  The figures will also be available individually in postscript
form.

What follows are instructions on how to download the files from both sites,
how to register your name for announcements, and how to send in comments.

      - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

TO DOWNLOAD THE FILES FROM DOCKMASTER:

The files can be found on DOCKMASTER in the directory:

          >site>pubs>criteria>FC

      - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

TO DOWNLOAD THE FILES FROM NIST'S BBS:

Volumes 1 and 2 of the FC can be accessed through the Internet via
anonymous ftp. To download, ftp to csrc.nist.gov or to 129.6.54.11.

Log in as "anonymous" and use your Internet address as the password.  The FC
postscript files are in directory /bbs/nistpubs.  The files are fcvol1.ps.Z
and fcvol2.ps.Z, for volumes one and two respectively.  Both of these volumes
have been ZIPped using PKZIP.  The PKZIP program is available in /bbs/software
should you need to download it.


REGISTERING YOUR NAME:

When you receive an electronic copy of the draft FC, please send us
you name, mailing address, telephone, and e-mail address to the e-
mail address listed below and state that you have an electronic
copy of the FC. If you distribute the document to additional people
in your organization, please send us the same information on those
people as well.  We will put the names into our database for any
further announcements, meeting notices, draft announcements, etc.,
related to the effort.  NIST will be sending out a LIMITED NUMBER
of hard copies, but due to the substantial expense of sending out
such a large document - even at book rate, we would prefer people
to receive the document via electronic means.  Therefore, by
sending us your name and the names of those in your organization
who have the downloaded copies of the document, it saves us from
having to send additional hard copies.

COMMENTS:

We are soliciting TECHNICAL, SUBSTANTIVE comments on the document.  The
deadline for comments is March 31, 1993.  All those who contribute substantive
comments will be invited to a two-day workshop at the end of April 1993 to
resolve the comments.  The workshop will be held in the Washington-Baltimore
area in a to-be- announced location.

Please send your comments to:

                    lynch@csmes.ncsl.nist.gov

Subject: Computers, Security and the Law

The University of York in the UK is running a two day conference on Computers,
Security and the Law that may be of interest to the readers of COMP.RISKS.
The programme for the conference follows.  If you do not think this is a
suitable place for this but know of somewhere that is perhaps you could
forward it or let me know and I will do so.

                          FINAL PROGRAMME.
                   COMPUTERS: SECURITY AND THE LAW
                       31 March - 1 April 1993

The conference will be run by the Department of Computer Science in
association with the Society for Computers & Law and the Licensing Executives
Society .

The aim of the conference is to highlight some of the important legal issues
that surround the use, and abuse, of computer technology in a way that should
be accessible to the non-specialist, such as lawyers or computer scientists.

The target audience for the conference is senior management and those in both
public and private sector organisations who wish to improve their knowledge
about the legal aspects of buying, using or creating computer related products
and services. The conference will be of interest to the police, the civil
service, banks, insurance and building societies.

The programme will take place over two consecutive days. The first day will
deal with the legal aspects of intellectual property rights, copyright and
contract law as it relates to computer products and services. The second day
will deal with the topics of computer crime and its prevention, security, data
protection and privacy.

The conference dinner will be a Medieval Banquet at St William's College
(founded in 1461).  The keynote speaker will be Emma Nicholson, MP.

Proceedings of the conference will be published and be available to 
participants after the conference.


REGISTRATION AND FEES:

Delegates will be able to register for either of the two days 
separately if they wish.   Fees: #275 for full conference, #165 for 
single day; a discount is available for early booking by 19th 
February 1993.  (See application form for further details.
