-----------------------------SYMPOSIUM OVERVIEW---------------------------------

FTCS is the world's most important forum for the presentation and
discussion of state of the art developments in dependable computing
systems. This year's program features 60 regular papers, 5 practical
experience reports, 6 software demonstrations and one panel. This program
is the result of a very stringent selection process carried out by the
international Program Committee on more than 300 submissions. The regular
paper sessions cover a breadth of topics from concurrent error detection to
software-implemented and application-based fault-tolerance, from
theoretical issues in modeling to field measurement of fault- tolerant
system dependability, from testing to fault injection. The opening plenary
session will be devoted to practical experience reports on two
safety-critical, software intensive systems currently in operation: the
digital fly-by-wire systems of the Airbus family of airliners, and the
speed control system of the Paris subway. The panel will discuss the limits
in dependability, and the software demonstrations will encompass tools for
hardware and software dependability evaluation.  

Exhibitors from both industrial and academic communities will present
commercially available products, advanced prototypes and tools relating to
the conference theme. An exhitors' forum will offer technical presentations
relating to the exhibited products, prototypes and tools.  

The symposium participants will be given the opportunity to attend a
pre-symposium review of the research conducted at LAAS-CNRS, as well as
joining post-symposium technical visits of Aerospatiale, CNES and Matra
Marconi Space.  

On Monday June 21, a welcome reception will be organized at Hotel Capoul.
On Tuesday June 22, the Mayor of Toulouse will give a reception in the
famous "Salle des Illustres", followed by a concert at the Jacobins
Cloister. 
On Wednesday June 23, the traditional excursion will be to Albi, home town
of the famous painter Toulouse-Lautrec, followed by a banquet. 


---------------------------------ABOUT TOULOUSE---------------------------------

TOULOUSE is situated in south-west France, 680 km from Paris. Toulouse is
the Capital of the Midi-Pyrenees Region, the largest French province. With
a population of 650 000, Toulouse is pink and green: old pink bricks and
green gardens with lots of pretty fountains and even barges going through
the Canal du Midi. Already bustling 2000 years ago, the city boasts a rare
architectural and artistic heritage including in particular the Basilica
Saint-Sernin (11th century), Saint-Etienne's Cathedral (12th century), the
Church and Cloister of the Jacobins (13th century) and the Capitole (18th
century).
Toulouse is the European Capital of aeronautics and space, and a leading
center in industry, technology and research. With a wealth of educational
institutions that include universities and several research laboratories
covering all spheres of knowledge, Toulouse has the second largest
university in France and ranks among the top university cities in Europe.
