Subject: Another "time bomb" -- MOSS

A colleague has just informed me that thousands of MOSS systems (a graphics
package) all over the world crashed on 15 Jul, due to some authentication
problem to do with the date.  The "quick fix" was to set the date backwards,
but this introduces its own problems; a lot of software rely on
monotonically-increasing timestamps (were there any problems reported at the
Leap Second on 0000 UTC 1st July?), and some Apollo systems use the time value
to generate "unique" (sic) file system descriptors...

Subject: Flood forecast risks

Living on the edge of the flooded Iowa River, I've been following the river
reports from the Corps of Engineers quite regularly in recent weeks.  They
offer a recording you can call at their local office that gives the current
river flow (in cubic feet per second), the current river stage in town, and
the current statistics for the Coralville Reservoir ten miles upstream from my
house.

This recording was well maintained until the reservoir went over the emergency
flood spillway for the first time ever on the night of Monday, July 5, and
then things began to break down.  Normally, the recording is a deadpan recital
of the numbers, but that night, the woman who recorded the message sounded
like she was in a state of panic, and soon after that, they discontinued the
recording for a week.

By midweek, even the data they were giving to the newspapers was sketchy, they
were reporting the outflow of the reservoir and the current water level, but
not the inflow.  Furthermore, their predictions began to get very sketchy --
it turns out that lightning hit the gauging station upstream from the
reservoir that they use to measure inflow, and without that data, they
couldn't run their computer models to predict outflow.  To quote one corps
official I chatted with while he was looking at the floodwaters down the block
from my house, they'd come to rely too much on their computer models and on
their automatic data collection system.

Another problem they face is that they know the capacity of their reservoir up
to the emergency flood spillway, but nobody every bothered to calculate the
capacity of the reservoir when the water is 4 feet above the spillway; I
gather that the working assumption has been that once water spilled over the
spillway, it would stop rising.  The spillway is 400 feet wide, so that seemed
intuitive, but this is an awfully big flood!

Clearly, the hydraulic models of river systems that the corps uses to manage
their flood control reservoirs need to be made more robust so that they can
handle missing data, and the assumption that water will never rise
significantly over dam spillways needs to be modified!

The Des Moines Register reported a similar but even more disastrous story
about the floods in Des Moines in their Sunday July 18 chronology of the
flood.  On the weekend of July 11, the waterworks director phoned the US
Weather Service for a flood forecast.  They apparently gave him a forecast of
a 22 foot crest on Tuesday, and when the director then told them that the
river was already over 23, they were taken by surprise.

In that case, there was no provision made to compare the flood forecast coming
out of the computer model with the current river data.  This data comes in
from stream gauging stations around the United States by satellite, and to
make a flood forecast, they combine this data with rainfall data.  If flood
forecasts could be computed instantly, there would be no problem, but they
aren't instantaneous and there was apparently no provision made for such a
sanity check on the forecast!

Subject: Re: Earthquake `early' warning system (Owens, RISKS-14.76)

Early warning systems have been kicking around the seismological community for
a decade at least.  Most studies of proposed early warning systems have shown
the economic return to be too small to justify development.  California
commissioned a such a study and chose not to pursue early warning on that
basis.  Of course, such analyses cannot include intangibles such as peace of
mind or people temporarily in hazardous situations (eg: holding a pot of
boiling water).

It is true that the system must be automated to achieve any warning.  The
system depends on detecting and identifying the quake in close proximity to
the source.  Then it relies on the speed of light exceeding that of elastic
waves.  The most damaging waves will arrive no earlier than an average
velocity of 4.5 km/s.  This would appear to give 45 seconds warning at 100 km.
However, the system itself takes time.  Without getting into the details, it
is safe to say that time from the quake to the sensors and then processing and
communicating the results might typically take 30 seconds.

This means that sites closest to the quake, those most adversely affected by
it, gain no benefit, and sites far away (more than 200 km or so in
California's case) do not benefit because the shaking is probably manageable.
So there is a narrow range of distance that benefits.  Even so, the system may
be justified.

To answer the risks mentioned - Of course, it would be a rare system that
could truly function without false alarms.  One need only keep the false alarm
rate to a manageable level, and make sure that any actions taken on the basis
of the alarm not be hazardous.  Slowing a train or halting elevators once or
twice a year should not be a problem.  In fact, I would think periodic tests
of the system would be important as well.  Predicting the damage should be
straightforward.  The magnitude of the quake can be estimated to sufficient
accuracy - then a standard magnitude/ distance relation will return a rough
expected intensity.  It would not be hard to be more accurate - one need only
measure the site response at the place where an action will be taken based on
the warning, then program a site correction into the receiver.  It is entirely
up to the receiver to determine expected intensity and at which intensity to
take which actions.  This receiver can be as sophisticated as needed, but it
will receive only magnitude, location and time.  (Later, "verification"
broadcasts could be made that rely on more data but take longer to produce.
Any actions taken at the first notice could be modified then.)

I see two risks.  The first is that most of the scientists involved seem to be
trying to pull a "dual-use" out of this system.  They want to deploy
sophisticated sensors that are good for seismological research, and save and
process mountains of data.  I think that if the system is to work well, such
efforts should be dropped.  Early warning long ago ceased to be a seismic
problem, it is an engineering and political problem.  The sensors to be
deployed should be a simple, reliable and inexpensive as possible, and should
transmit a minimum of data to cut communications costs.  By cutting physical
and communications costs, the number of sensors can be increased and the cost
of the entire program reduced.  More sensors mean more warning time and more
people benefit (up to the limit of the depth of the quakes).

The second risk is that people may rely on the existence of the system.
I would hate to see someone designing something and say "well, if there
was a quake, this would be a problem, but we have the early warning".

Security will be seen by many as a risk, but I think that is addressable by
isolating the system from phone communications and networks and encrypting all
communications.

Such a device (ground proximity warning system - GPWS) already exists and is
mandatory on international flights. The Strasbourg A320 was only used
domestically in France - where GPWS is (was?) not required.  For some reason
the airline decided not to install that equipment (or even had it disabled - I
have some recollection that GPWS is standard equipment on the A320).

GPWS will alert the pilot to five different conditions (modes) that are
considered unsafe at low altitude. Excess rate of descent is one of them.

The simple fact of the matter is that using Internet to handle 
charge-card transactions is not very common for several reasons:

(1) Soliciting CC transactions might violate the Acceptable Use
    Provisions (doesn't apply if your feed is from a commercial
    internet connection.)

(2) Electronic mail is sent *in the clear* across the network.  While
    it is part of a series of packets, it still can be seen by
    (a) the administrator of your site (b) the administrator of the
    destination site (c) anyone having access to the network connections
    used between the two sites who wants to monitor traffic.

In theory, some bright boy could put a "mail scanner" on the system and
watch for any messages that contain a string of 12 or 16 digits beginning
with 4 or 5 and capture those messages.  

This means that someone watching for a message where the text 
contains:

I'd like to order a 300 meg hard drive.  Ship to 
  Hathan Nale,
  1 Patriot Lane, 
  Fourth July, MD 21776

Charge 4000 1776 1492 1993  exp 7/4/2076

Now someone supposedly could watch for this and keep such information.
Rare, but it could happen.  

For those who are paranoid, the answer, of course, is to have 
privacy-enhanced mail made freely available.  Once people have the 
ability to send mail to someone encoded with their private key and
the recipient's public key, so that only the recipient can decode
it, and so the sender can't deny it was sent, we will have problems.

There is probably close to 100 megabytes of transfers going across 
Internet every day; 40 meg of this is usenet news alone.  While your
little message might never be noticed, the chance is it could.  Or 
you could mis mail it.

For example, say you intended to mail this order to "info-fax@sdi.com"
(For, example, Soft-Disk Inc., a hard-disk seller) and instead, you miss and
send it to "info-vax@sri.com" (it's only off by two characters), instead
of sending the message with your credit card number to the one person at
Soft-Disk Inc, you've just mailed it to the 75,000 readers of Info-Vax,
which is gatewayed into "comp.os.vms".

PS: the above credit card number is fictitious.

>Simple ideas like replacing bills that contain a single amount ...

Actually, one of our local doctors has initiated a billing system very close
to what you desire (after years of confusing us with what insurance payment
went with what service, etc).  The general form of the bill now looks like:

  Date     Date/Code    Description            Amount       Amount    Balance

01/01/93    123456      Office Visit            35.00

           02/24/93     Insurance Payment       17.50CR
           02/24/93     Write-off                7.50CR
            234567      Laboratory Work         25.00
           02/24/93     Insurance Payment       18.00CR
                        Coinsurance Due                      7.00       7.00

02/10/93    345678      Consultation             50.00
           04/02/93     Insurance Payment        37.50CR
           04/02/93     Write-off                 4.00CR
                        Coinsurance Due                      8.50      15.50

Several features of this format deserve special mention.  First, note that
events are only listed in chronological order within each "block," and that
the specific office code for each billable service is given.  In the above
example, even though the consultation occurred before the insurance payments
for the original office visit, those payments are listed with the service
that generated them.  Also, notice the existence of explicit write-offs.  Our
doctor is a "preferred provider" with a major health insurance company, and
has agreed to accept the company's Usual, Customary, and Reasonable (UCR)
amounts as payment in full.  Even though the insurer doesn't alway *pay* the
UCR amount, which means we still have copayments and coinsurance, there is
still usually a difference between what the doctor "charges" and what he will
accept as full payment.  This billing format makes that distinction explicit
for the first time.

How does this format reduce RISK?  Simple.  A recent bill (the first in this
new format) seemed a tad high (like $200 or so too much), so we re-created
our entire service history with that doctor in a spreadsheet and used this
format.  We quickly noticed where he had overlooked a previous account credit,
and where he had forgotten to include a write-off for a specific service.
It's probably easy to appreciate the level of frustration and helplessness
we had previously felt with regard to keeping track of the myriad of bills,
copayments, coinsurance, insurance payments, etc. for a couple of doctors
and a dentist (we don't even have KIDS yet!).  I will now keep track of
all health service accounts using the new billing format, and will encourage
our other doctors to do the same.

Subject: DSS as a stamp tax

There seems to be a lot of misunderstanding about what happened between
NIST and PKP.  NIST didn't ``give away'' anything to PKP.  Rather,
PKP had NIST over a legal barrel; some sort of deal was necessary.
You can argue over the specific terms, but practically speaking, NIST
had little choice.

The problem is this:  the DSS appears to infringe several different
patents owned by PKP.  (I'm not going to discuss the propriety of
algorithm patents here, a decision that I'm sure our esteemed moderator
will applaud, given his comments about the load.)  These include the
Diffie-Hellman exponential key exchange patent and the Schnorr digital
signature patent.  It could be argued that for various reasons, these
don't apply.  Maybe -- but that's far obvious.  At the very least, the
standard would be tied up in court for many years.

NIST can't ignore such patents.  Their own policy supports the propriety
of such things (DSS itself is being patented.)  And the government is
not allowed to ignore private patent rights; that would, I'm told,
constitute an illegal taking of property, as per the Fifth Amendment.

That left NIST with several choices, none great.  They could do nothing,
and not promulgate any standard.  But that wouldn't meet the government's
own need for one.  They could adopt RSA, since the government has free
rights to that patent.  The rest of us would still have to pay royalties
for its use.  Besides, RSA can be used for secrecy, which NIST didn't
want.  (They cite exportability; others cite NSA's desire to spy.
Pick your rationale.)  Or they could ask NSA for a totally new signature
scheme.  Maybe NSA has one -- but I doubt very much they're going
to reveal a totally new way to do cryptographic operations.

Finally, NIST could cut a deal with PKP.  That's what they chose to do.  It's
not in any way a plot to enrich PKP; it's simply the only way to preserve the
DSS.

Subject: Re: DSS as a stamp tax

Mark Seecof should really should have read the DSS announcement more carefully
before drawing any conclusions.  The announcement said that DSS would be
royalty-free for government use.  Only private-sector use would require
licensing.  He compares it to a "tax."

He writes:

> forcing us to pay PKP everytime we sign something digitally ...

Very wrong.  When someone in the private sector licenses DSS, they pay a
royalty once for the manufacture and sale of the product, not its use. (It
says you can license even the chips, the lowest cost component of a system.
There is quite a difference between a "use tax" and a "royalty.")

If he was referring to the $1 per certificate, that comes only from those who
provide certificates as a service as a service, not from the user, and not for
"use" of a signature product.

Subject: CPSR Secrecy Statement 

  CPSR Secrecy Statement

    Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR) has called for a
complete overhaul in the federal government's information classification
system, including the removal of cryptography from the categories of
information automatically deemed to be secret.  In a letter to a special
Presidential task force examining the classification system, CPSR said that
the current system -- embodied in an Executive Order issued by President
Reagan in 1982 -- "has limited informed public debate on technological issues
and has restricted scientific innovation and technological development."

       The CPSR statement, which was submitted in response to a task force
request for public comments, strongly criticizes a provision in the Reagan
secrecy directive that presumptively classifies any information that "concerns
cryptology."  CPSR notes that "while cryptography -- the science of making and
breaking secret security codes -- was once the sole province of the military
and the intelligence agencies, the technology today plays an essential role in
assuring the security and privacy of a wide range of communications affecting
finance, education, research and personal correspondence."  With the end of
the Cold War and the growth of widely available computer network services, the
outdated view of cryptography reflected in the Reagan order must change,
according to the statement.

       CPSR's call for revision of the classification system is based upon the
organization's experience in attempting to obtain government information
relating to cryptography and computer security issues.  CPSR is currently
litigating Freedom of Information Act lawsuits against the National Security
Agency (NSA) seeking the disclosure of technical data concerning the digital
signature standard (DSS) and the administration's recent "Clipper Chip"
proposal.  NSA has relied on the Reagan Executive Order as authority for
withholding the information from the public.

       In its submission to the classification task force, CPSR also called
for the following changes to the current secrecy directive:

     * A return to the "balancing test," whereby the public interest in
     the disclosure of information is weighed against the claimed harm
     that might result from such disclosure;

     * A prohibition against the reclassification of information that has
     been previously released;

     * The requirement that the economic cost of classifying scientific
     and technical be considered before such information may be classified;

     * The automatic declassification of information after 20 years,
     unless the head of the original classifying agency, in the exercise
     of his or her non-delegatable authority, determines in writing that
     the material requires continued classification for a specified period
     of time; and

     * The establishment of an independent oversight commission to monitor 
     the operation of the security classification system.

       The task force is scheduled to submit a draft revision of the Executive
Order to President Clinton on November 30.

       The full text of the CPSR statement can be obtained via ftp, wais and
gopher from cpsr.org, under the filename cpsr\crypto\secrecy_statement.txt.
