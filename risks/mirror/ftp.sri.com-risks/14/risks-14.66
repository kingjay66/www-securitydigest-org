Subject: Possible RISK in data retrieval?

Has anybody seen this?  I can forsee many potential risks in an on-line
data retrieval system involving Probationers.  How do the Probation Officers
call in to check or (:gasp:) update their data?  I've asked BI Inc., but 
have not heard a reply:


   BOULDER, Colo., May 12 /PRNewswire/ -- BI Inc. (NASDAQ-NMS: BIAC), the
nation's leading provider of electronically monitored systems for corrections,
today announced receipt of notification from the United States Patent Office
of issuance of a patent to BI on April 20, 1993.  BI's newly granted patent
includes the application presented in the BI PROFILE(TM) automated
administrative caseload management system.
    At no cost to corrections agencies, BI PROFILE provides automated
administrative caseload management via a computer located at BI Monitoring
Corp.'s central station.  Probationers are assigned individual PIN numbers and
security passwords, and required to call a 900 number once a month to report
any administrative changes.  BI's computer asks the callers a series of
questions (i.e., change in home telephone number, address, employment, etc.).
Each call placed averages 2 or 3 minutes in duration and is charged to the
probationer's home telephone bill.  Considered exception reporting, BI PROFILE
only provides reports to corrections agencies if probationers fail to call in
on their pre-assigned monthly date or if any status changes are reported
during the calls.  Prior to BI PROFILE, administrative caseload management of
probationers has been via a manual system which has put a significant burden
on corrections agencies as the number of probationers continues to rise at the
federal, state and local levels.
    Additional options available on BI PROFILE are features to insure that
probationers are calling from the designated telephone number, that
probationers have not previously called in for the month, collection of
monthly probation supervision fees and 800 telephone service for the indigent
population.  BI has additional patents pending on these and other BI PROFILE
options as well.
    BI PROFILE services are offered to the corrections market by BI through
its wholly owned subsidiary, BI Monitoring Corp. (BIMCORP).  "BI PROFILE is
another service offering from BI Monitoring Corporation that is the direct
result of BI's strategy to expand its recurring revenue base," said John K.
Fulda, Jr., BI's corporate vice president in charge of BI Monitoring.  "We
believe that the BI PROFILE family of services offers tremendous growth
potential for BI Monitoring Corporation in the years ahead," he concluded.

Subject: X application to finger

Here is an interesting episode.

I run an X application (public domain) that, given a list of remote sites and
a list of userids, periodically "finger"s the sites, searching to see if the
named users are logged on. If yes, they are updated on a small screen window.

Following is a mail I received from the security officer at one of the
sites...It was interesting to note that sys admins *are* on the lookout
for even those minor chances of hacking

-------- The mail --------

I assume since you're logged into the console, you have some responsibility
for machine.cs.univ.edu:
 
It appears that somebody may have cracked your system, and is using it as a
base to attempt to break into other systems: every six minutes, some process
on your machine contacts the finger daemon on cs.anotheruniv.edu and attempts 
to see who is logged on.  This is generally taken as an attempt to extract 
usernames, preparatory to hacking the system.
  
Strangely, this seems to be correlated to your being logged in.  It appears
to have started on May 12th.  I've ignored it before now since until this
point it has been only a minor annoyance.  We would appreciate your looking
into this matter, and seeing that it ceases.

Subject:  Re: Fake ATM Machine Steals PINs

<eric@cadkey.com> describes the now-well-known fake ATM scam for capturing
account and PIN numbers for subsequent forging in order to relieve consumers
of the burden of large account balances.  Recall that the ATM "scam artists"
obtained permission from officials of the shopping Mall where the scam took
place.

He asks, "How are you supposed to stop this new trick???"  Like many RISKS,
you don't "stop" the trick but you minimize the RISK:

	1. You needn't be the first in your block to use the new ATM.

	2. Watch for announcements from your bank or credit union of new
locations.  Our credit union announces in its newsletter *every* new ATM which
it owns/installs (i.e., were members pay no fee for access).  One could have
been suspicious of the (around here) then-uncommon installation in local
groceries, but they were announced as mentioned.

	3. You could always phone the bank whose name appears on the
ATM.  If there's no name, who's running the machine?

    [FOR SOME REASON THE CONFERENCE MANAGEMENT DID NOT SEND THIS ANNOUNCEMENT
    TO RISKS UNTIL 1 JUNE, WHICH IS AFTER THE ANNOUNCED DEADLINE FOR DISCOUNTED
    REGISTRATION.  Karen Ferraiolo (see below) has agreed to give a special
    deal to RISKS SUBSCRIBERS, SO THAT YOU MAY REGISTER UNTIL THE END OF THIS
    WEEK AT THE REDUCED RATE.  However, she asks that you let her know ASAP.
    We do not generally run conference announcements in full, but in light of
    the closeness of the date and the special consideration for RISKS readers,
    it seemed appropriate.  This conference has always been closely related to
    the RISKS subject matter.  PGN]

The goal of COMPASS, an acronym formed from COMPuter ASSurance, is to advance
the theory and practice of the creation and use of critical systems through
the medium of scientific and engineering meeting and publications.  COMPASS
expresses the idea of "Pointing the Way" and of "enCOMPASSing" many
technologies and technical disciplines.  The logo, a variation of yin-yang
overlaying a compass rose, symbolizes both of these ideas.  We invite you to
participate in COMPASS activities and increase the benefits of COMPASS.
