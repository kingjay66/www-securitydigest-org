Subject: IFIP resolution on demeaning games

According to the "Newstrack" in CACM (2/93; p.13), IFIP has adopted a
resolution condemning the production, distribution, and use of computer games
that demean human beings and advocate malicious behavior by the players.  The
resolution points to the growth of brutal war games, sexist games, and games
based on themes of racial, ethnic, or religious hatred.  The document states:
"IFIP appeals to everybody worldwide to censure harmful games, to raise
awareness of the issues involved, and to support only computer games that
respect human dignity."

(Does anyone know the origin of the issue within IFIP or whether a more
complete description exists.)

Subject: Fake ATM Machine Steals PINs

Everyone knows you're supposed to be VERY careful about not revealing your PIN
number for your ATM card.  How are you supposed to stop this new trick???  At
the Buckland Hills Mall, in Manchester CT, last week, some scam artists
installed a fake ATM machine.  They had negotiated with the Mall officers,
pretending to be Bank officials, and had gotten permission.  Apparently, they
even got the phone company to come in and lay down some lines.  Then, they
installed an ATM machine they had stolen.

It was programmed to read off the account numbers, remember the PIN as it was
typed, then claim some kind of error and refuse to give out money.  They left
the machine in the mall for a WEEK, collecting PINs, then they came back, took
it machine back to "repair", and have since printed up new cards, and have
been using the PINs to siphon off money.....

Why didn't I think of that??

  [New trick?  This is one of the oldest scams going, but it still recurs. PGN]

Subject: Teller Users Beware

Any of you that use an automated telephone transaction system to do your
banking (or to make balance inquiries, etc.) may be interested in an
experience I had today.

I dialed in and was connected to a session in progress that belonged to
another user (who probably hung up after receiving whatever information he/she
requested). I immediately transferred all their money into my account...no
just kidding :) I would hate to think that might happen to me, especially
since some of these services allow you to move money around.

I would like to suggest to anyone using these type of services (including
voice-mail services) to back all the way out of the system before hanging up.
Some systems (like Aerospace voice-mail) allow you to disconnect via a
command, before hanging up, but many do not. My banking system does not allow
me to disconnect without hanging up, but it does allow me to back out of the
menus until I reach the main menu which prompts for user password before
proceeding. From now on I'm going to make sure I back out to that level before
hanging up.

Signed,

Could-have-been-rich.

   [Another old classic.  The TENEX undetected-hangup problem years ago had
   similar properties, leaving a dial-up port still active, waiting for the 
   next dial-up to randomly stumble upon a logged-in user session.  PGN]

From: Dave Banisar <banisar@washofc.cpsr.org>
Subject: New NIST/NSA Revelations 

        Less than three weeks after the White House announced a controversial
initiative to secure the nation's electronic communications with
government-approved cryptography, newly released documents raise serious
questions about the process that gave rise to the administration's proposal.
The documents, released by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, suggest that the
super-secret National Security Agency (NSA) dominates the process of
establishing security standards for civilian computer systems in contravention
of the intent of legislation Congress enacted in 1987.

        The released material concerns the development of the Digital
Signature Standard (DSS), a cryptographic method for authenticating the
identity of the sender of an electronic communication and for authenticating
the integrity of the data in that communication.  NIST publicly proposed the
DSS in August 1991 and initially made no mention of any NSA role in developing
the standard, which was intended for use in unclassified, civilian
communications systems.  NIST finally conceded that NSA had, in fact,
developed the technology after Computer Professionals for Social
Responsibility (CPSR) filed suit against the agency for withholding relevant
documents.  The proposed DSS was widely criticized within the computer
industry for its perceived weak security and inferiority to an existing
authentication technology known as the RSA algorithm.  Many observers have
speculated that the RSA technique was disfavored by NSA because it was, in
fact, more secure than the NSA-proposed algorithm and because the RSA
technique could also be used to encrypt data very securely.

        The newly-disclosed documents -- released in heavily censored form at
the insistence of NSA -- suggest that NSA was not merely involved in the
development process, but dominated it.  NIST and NSA worked together on the
DSS through an intra-agency Technical Working Group (TWG).  The documents
suggest that the NIST-NSA relationship was contentious, with NSA insisting
upon secrecy throughout the deliberations.  A NIST report dated January 31,
1990, states that

     The members of the TWG acknowledged that the efforts
     expended to date in the determination of a public key
     algorithm which would be publicly known have not been
     successful.  It's increasingly evident that it is
     difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile the concerns
     and requirements of NSA, NIST and the general public
     through using this approach.

        The civilian agency's frustration is also apparent in a July 21, 1990,
memo from the NIST members of the TWG to NIST director John W. Lyons.  The
memo suggests that "national security" concerns hampered efforts to develop a
standard:

     THE NIST/NSA Technical Working Group (TWG) has held 18
     meetings over the past 13 months.  A part of every
     meeting has focused on the NIST intent to develop a
     Public Key Standard Algorithm Standard.  We are
     convinced that the TWG process has reached a point where
     continuing discussions of the public key issue will
     yield only marginal results.  Simply stated, we believe
     that over the past 13 months we have explored the
     technical and national security equity issues to the
     point where a decision is required on the future
     direction of digital signature standards.

An October 19, 1990, NIST memo discussing possible patent issues surrounding
DSS noted that those questions would need to be addressed "if we ever get our
NSA problem settled."

        Although much of the material remains classified and withheld from
disclosure, the "NSA problem" was apparently the intelligence agency's demand
that perceived "national security" considerations take precedence in the
development of the DSS.  From the outset, NSA cloaked the deliberations in
secrecy.  For instance, at the March 22, 1990, meeting of the TWG, NSA
representatives presented NIST with NSA's classified proposal for a DSS
algorithm.  NIST's report of the meeting notes that

     The second document, classified TOP SECRET CODEWORD, was
     a position paper which discussed reasons for the
     selection of the algorithms identified in the first
     document.  This document is available at NSA for review
     by properly cleared senior NIST officials.

In other words, NSA presented highly classified material to NIST justifying
NSA's selection of the proposed algorithm -- an algorithm intended to protect
and authenticate unclassified information in civilian computer systems.  The
material was so highly classified that "properly cleared senior NIST
officials" were required to view the material at NSA's facilities.

        These disclosures are disturbing for two reasons.  First, the process
as revealed in the documents contravenes the intent of Congress embodied in
the Computer Security Act of 1987.  Through that legislation, Congress
intended to remove NSA from the process of developing civilian computer
security standards and to place that responsibility with NIST, a civilian
agency.  Congress expressed a particular concern that NSA, a military
intelligence agency, would improperly limit public access to information in a
manner incompatible with civilian standard setting.  The House Report on the
legislation noted that NSA's

     natural tendency to restrict and even deny access to
     information that it deems important would disqualify
     that agency from being put in charge of the protection
     of non-national security information in the view of many
     officials in the civilian agencies and the private
     sector.

While the Computer Security Act contemplated that NSA would provide NIST with
"technical assistance" in the development of civilian standards, the newly
released documents demonstrate that NSA has crossed that line and dominates
the development process.

        The second reason why this material is significant is because of what
it reveals about the process that gave rise to the so- called "Clipper" chip
proposed by the administration earlier this month.  Once again, NIST was
identified as the agency actually proposing the new encryption technology,
with "technical assistance" from NSA.  Once again, the underlying information
concerning the development process is classified.  DSS was the first test of
the Computer Security Act's division of labor between NIST and NSA.  Clipper
comes out of the same "collaborative" process.  The newly released documents
suggest that NSA continues to dominate the government's work on computer
security and to cloak the process in secrecy, contrary to the clear intent of
Congress.

        On the day the Clipper initiative was announced, CPSR submitted FOIA
requests to key agencies -- including NIST and NSA -- for information
concerning the proposal.  CPSR will pursue those requests, as well as the
pending litigation concerning NSA involvement in the development of the
Digital Signature Standard.  Before any meaningful debate can occur on the
direction of cryptography policy, essential government information must be
made public -- as Congress intended when it passed the Computer Security Act.
CPSR is committed to that goal.
