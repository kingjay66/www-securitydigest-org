REPORTEDLY A LEGISLATIVE "FIRST"
   This effort in "electronic democracy" may be the first time that state 
legislation has been distributed online, for access by the general public, 
at the same time it becomes available to legislators and their staff.
   A senior member of the Senate computer system's technical staff reportedly 
said they have never-before down-loaded a machine-readable copy of initial 
legislation onto a personal computer for redistribution on public computer 
networks.
  Furthermore, Sen. Lockyer's Legislative Assistant responsible for the bill 
said he knows of no prior instance where legislative staff have gone online 
on public nets to seek citizen input and discussion about new legislation.

SOURCES OF ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS & INFORMATION
   Mr. Ben Firschein is the Legislative Assistant to Sen. Lockyer who is 
handling this bill:

There will be four read-only files:

   B.  The above file, converted to a Word-5.0 Macintosh format, with 
pagination approximating the printed copies of the bill available from the 
legislative offices.
   C.  Background information, explanations and mention of some alternatives,

   D.  That backgrounder file, converted to Word-5.0 Macintosh format.

REPRESENTING LEGISLATION-IN-PROGRESS: A NOTATION PROBLEM
   In the California Senate, printed legislation-in-progress uses the 
following conventions:
  When stating new legislation, *plain-text* states PROPOSED law.
  When *amending* current law, *plain-text* states the CURRENT law, and 
*strike-thru text* indicates current law to be deleted while *underscored* or 
*italicized* text represents wording to be added to those current statutes.  
Deletions and additions represented by strike-thru and underlining or italics 
*amend* current law.
  But, the basic ASCII character-set -- and a great many older terminals and 
computer printers -- have no strike-thru, italics or underlining.  So, here 
is how that unavailable notation is represented in this document:
    [[ annotation ]] -- explanatory comments by "uploader" Jim Warren
       all capitals  -- originally bold-face text; no legislative meaning
  Unless stated as amending current law:
       plain-text    -- text of new legislation, proposed to be new law
  When stated as amending current law:
       plain-text    -- text of current law to remain unchanged
    << strikethru >> -- text in current law, proposed for deletion
    {{ underscore }} -- text proposed to be added to current law.

THE BEGINNING ...
  The introduction of this legislation in the Senate is the beginning of 
a lengthy process or review and revision by amendment, prior to its possible 
passage into law.
  Please send your comments and suggestions about the legislation -- and 
about the Senate staff's active cooperation in making it publicly available, 
online -- to Mr. Firschein and Sen. Lockyer.
