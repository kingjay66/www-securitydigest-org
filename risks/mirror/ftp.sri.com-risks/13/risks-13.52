Subject: Yellow Slime Shuts Down Munich Opera

The computer-controlled hydraulic system for the stage at the Munich Opera is a
wonder of modern technology, controlling all rolling side stages, platforms,
flats and panels.  It is the ultimate play-by-wire system and for many
explicitly programmed operas the show cannot go on without it.  The problem is
that the hydraulic fluid used in the new system (circulating in the old water
pipes) is 50,000 liters of ecologically correct Quintolubric oil, made in the
Netherlands.  Unfortunately, it is biodegradable, and the bacteria left over
from the old pipes love it.  The result is a nasty yellow slime that multiplies
fruitfully.  The repertory has been trimmed dramatically, excluding those works
that cannot be performed without it, and reducing some others to concert
versions.  Some performances have had to be halted in mid-scene, which requires
cleaning all vents and filters.  Audiences are upset.  The cost to fix the
problem (presumably to replace all the pipes and change the oil to something
ecologically less sound) is estimated at $24M.  [Source: A NY Times article by
John Rockwell, seen in the San Francisco Chronicle, 26 May 1992, p.E2]

Subject: "Programming error" prevents long distance billing

  THOUSANDS DIAL LONG-DISTANCE 'FREE' AS A COMPUTER GLITCH HANGS UP BELL
               Star Ledger:Newark-NJ, 22 May 1992, p.1

New Jersey Bell officials said yesterday that thousands of New Jersey Bell
customers have been dialing long-distance between February 17 and April 27
without being billed for any of the calls. The situation, involving about two
million calls, was blamed by New Jersey Bell on an internal programming error.
The error affected 15 exchanges in the state and blanketed all direct-dialed
calls made through AT&T.  New Jersey Bell said the calls were registered and
customers will eventually be back-billed, which could result in some large
telephone bills. However, an AT&T spokesperson said customers could contact New
Jersey Bell to "arrange a flexible billing arrangement so there is no financial
hardship."

Subject: White House Fights to Erase E-Mail Backups

From a story by Paul Houston in the L.A. Times 20 May 1992:

Two days before President Bush took office, a researcher discovered that the
new Administration planned to erase computer backup tapes containing thousands
of messages sent by "electronic mail" [sic] throughout the White House of
departing President Ronald Reagan.

The report alarmed groups representing historians and reporters, who for
decades have been able to go to the National Archives and plow through the
records of past Administrations, gaining valuable insight into how policies
were formed and carried out.

The groups knew that some E-mail tapes already had been shown to carry
incriminating messages between former National Security Advisor John M.
Poindexter and his aide, Oliver L. North, in the Iran-Contra scandal.

Fearing that much more treasure was about to vanish in this new electronic age,
one group immediately filed suit and won a temporary order preserving many
tapes.  That ignited a far-reaching clash between researchers and the Bush
Administration that is finally coming to a head Friday in federal court.

At stake is not only past tapes but present ones, which are being regularly
erased before unknown numbers of messages can be printed out and saved for the
National Archives.

"We are probably losing fascinating snatches of things that provide
illumination and point you in new directions," laments Robert J. Donovon, who
has written histories of former Presidents Harry S. Truman, Dwight D.
Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy.

BACKGROUND:  The federal Records Act requires that "all books, papers, maps,
photographs, machine readable materials" dealing with government "policies,
decisions, procedures, operations" be preserved for the National Archives.

In 1978, Congress made clear that the law applied to presidential records,
including "electronic or mechanical recordations."  The move blocked an attempt
by former President Richard M. Nixon to control--and theoretically destroy--all
tapes of conversations between him and his staff that had led to his
resignation in the Watergate scandal.

When the Iran-Contra affair broke in 1987, investigators searched White House
computer tapes for messages involving Poindexter, North and other White House
aids.  The aides thought they had erased the messages--but many were preserved
on backup memory [sic] tapes.

One message that has been made public concerned a 1986 meeting at which North
later admitted he lied to a group of congressmen about his support of the
Nicaraguan Contras.  A Poindexter aide reported by E-mail that "session was
success," with North saying that he "gave no military advice" to the Contras.
Poindexter forwarded the note to North, attaching an E-mail message of his own
that said: "Well done."

ISSUES:  "The Administration would call those two words a mere telephone
message slip," and not a record that must be preserved, says Thomas Blanton,
head of the National Security Archive, a research center that filed the pending
suit.  "But a historian would say those words give the whole picture of
suborning testimony to Congress," he added.

The plaintiffs contend that the records preservation law clearly covers E-mail
and that the head archivist has sole authority to determine which White House
messages should be kept for posterity.

Justice Department attorneys respond that a White House manual--leaving it to
aides to decide which E-mail should be printed out for safekeeping--is
sufficient to comply with the law.  Most of the messages are personal or
trivial anyway, the attorneys contend.

The plaintiffs have asked U.S. District Judge Charles Richey to order the
Administration to turn over a large sampling of E-mail from the Reagan years so
he can determine whether it--and by extension, much subsequent E-mail--should
be preserved.  Richey is expected to rule on the request Friday.

Subject: Critical technologies

Did I miss an earlier discussion of the March 1991 Report of the (US) National
Critical Technologies Panel?

The software section makes depressing reading.  Complexity is identified as the
problem.  CASE is identified as The Answer.

Under "Innovative Concepts", two are identified: rapid prototyping and modular
software.  (Perhaps this section got left in from a report a decade earlier, by
mistake :-)

The impossibility of exhaustive testing is identified, yet testing is seen to
be the answer! "Intensive efforts are underway to develop advanced testing
tools that attempt to simulate the broadest possible set of conditions in which
a program might operate.  By reducing manual quality control requirements, these
tools have the potential to greatly shorten the software development cycle and
reduce development costs".  By juxtaposition, this is set as the solution to
"complex software cannot be exhaustively tested prior to release".

The section ends: "The central challenge in software development is automated
code generation for sophisticated programs. The development of such tools is
largely dependent upon artificial intelligence and other software-based
technologies. ... ...".

The Risk? That someone might actually believe this stuff (although I concede
that it seems unlikely).

Subject: Re: Not enough trained computer experts (FBCohen, RISKS-13.51)

I think there's a gigantic conceptual leap from the skepticism that people 
may have that an extant system (UNIX, in this case) can be reliably hacked 
to be something that it wasn't intended to be--secure--to extrapolating that 
to a broad notion that the ground-up design of a secure system is impossible.  
There are bases for both viewpoints: what actually happens has largely to 
do with the usual design trade-offs of features vs. functionality, and how
much money the developing agency has to throw at the problem.  

UNIX, with its historically anarchic functional development, and relatively 
simple OS, is a particularly bad example to be using.  Yeah, there are lots 
of people at work developing secure UNIX, but I have doubts as to what's 
being done to the OS to pull it off.  What they produce might run a shell, 
all the right software, and keep the bogiemen out, but the hackwork that's 
involved is pretty impressive.  And hackwork tends to produce unforeseen 
effects: thus a never-ending cycle of fixes and hacks, to plug those 
unforeseen problems, in an ever-increasingly complex OS.  It's no wonder 
people are skeptical.

Changing the fundamental emphasis of an aspect of an existing complex software 
system-- in this case, changing the "security" emphasis of UNIX to keeping 
errant Russians out, from keeping errant students or casual intruders out--is 
always more tricky than designing a system designed for a SPECIFIC emphasis 
from scratch.  

>  How come
>we never hear on the risks forum about any successes where the computer
>security system saves people?  

Why should we?  We all know such systems exist.  Or, at least, we hope
they exist.  I'm not willing to adjudge any complex program *I* write as
"100% reliable."  Notwithstanding logical or semantic errors, there are many 
ways in which a language can be misinterpreted or misimplemented by a given 
compiler.  What's the cut-off point at which we can claim to judge a section
of code "reliable"?  100,000 lines?  50,000 lines?  10 lines?  Is an ag-
gregate of such reliable segments in itself reliable?  You tell me. 

The *problems* occur where systems fail.  It's way too easy to fall into a 
see-no-evil, hear-no-evil mindset, which seems to be precisely that which 
your advertisers--who you're complaining about--wish to propagate!  
It is my perception that the risks forum was intended *precisely* to offer an
alternative to the widespread propagation of such attitudes in the industry.  
It serves an important purpose: to show people (including a great many 
students, not yet a part of the Real World) that the spec sheets can't always 
be believed; that sloppy, cheap design is all too often the order of the day; 
and that ideal, elegant solutions don't always get done right in the real
world.  We can read about elegant solutions in the journals, or have them 
ordained from some professor, any time.  

>nuclear reactor stories where human error was detected and corrected by a
>computer and saved us from a meltdown?  

But isn't it so much more productive to concentrate on cases where such
meltdowns were averted only by the last level of redundancy?  And then 
debate why higher levels of redundancy failed?  The possibility of the
last level of redundancy failing NEXT time is so unacceptable that we
can't possibly take time off and thank our lucky stars that we got it 
right, this time.  Safety-critical systems require--DEMAND--INTENSE 
scrutiny and criticism.

>So, this whole thing was inspired by the British story about BA incidents.  

But don't forget the two pilots in the cockpit, monitoring the instruments,
*waiting* for the all-important comparator or autopilot annunciator to 
indicate a failure state, and ready, at the first sign of trouble, to
CLICK IT OFF and go around.  This being the sole emphasis of all their
training: the determination of the point when a situation's going to hell,
and what to do.  An integral part of the *safety* checks of the system.  
THAT thought makes me comfortable, through a landing in weather I wouldn't 
be caught driving a car in.  Unfortunately, though, I KNOW airline pilots 
who have too much faith in the automation, who expect it to do what they tell 
it to, who view it as an abstract entity that "does" things, and not merely a 
machine, a collection of parts, decisions, and compromises, a machine 
which, like all machines, can FAIL.  They are trained like any other airline 
pilot, but can spend lifetimes with no fundamental problems, and get sloppy.  
Those pilots (and their passengers) DIE when they get too far behind the 
airplane, and rely on the computer to do their job.  And lo and behold, the 
747-400, which makes such wonderful landings, has a cockpit environment so 
secure, so amazing, that it's almost tailor-made to produce such attitudes.  

But I know: the solution to sloppy pilots in automated cockpits is to increase
the automation ("Hey, we can do it!"), to protect us from the pilots (ala
A3[2-4]0 FBW), which, in turn, can produce even more isolated, insulated
attitudes, thus producing even more fundamental mistakes.  Ad nauseum.

Enjoy your next flight. :-)

>The point is that the reason we don't have enough experts to do QA is that we
>don't teach that stuf in schools, we punish those who follow that line (as a
>society), 

I think you're mistaken.  The sole reason that highly robust systems are not
pursued, whether it be operating systems or retail-vertical software, is money.
Cheap solutions that fit the customer or marketing specification, that don't
break too often, are the order of the day.  When companies are willing to spend
more money on development--and research on methods, and training decent
software engineers, and willing to postpone release a couple of years when the
production process--which is an art, not a science, and not amenable to Harvard
Business School management tactics--bogs down, AND society's willing to
shoulder the extra costs all that will engender: THEN we'll have something to
talk about. :-)

I can see what you're saying, but I don't think your position's very 
productive.  Several times a year, RISKS sees "lighten up!" posts, but 
let's keep the name and charter of the digest in mind.  

Perhaps we need a "USA Today" version of RISKS, a respite for when the gloom 
and doom becomes a bit much. :-)

This is the third Working Conference on this topic, following the successful
conferences held in August, 1989, at Santa Barbara (USA) and in February, 1991,
at Tucson (USA). As evidenced by papers that were presented and discussed at
those meetings, critical applications of computing systems are concerned with
differing service properties, relating to both the nature of proper service and
the system's ability to deliver it. These include thresholds of performance and
real-time responsiveness that demark loss of proper service (failure),
continuity of proper service, ability to avoid catastrophic failures, and
prevention of deliberate privacy intrusions.

The notion of dependability, defined as the trustworthiness of computer service
such that reliance can justifiably be placed on this service, enables these
various concerns to be subsumed within a single conceptual framework.
Dependability thus includes as special cases such attributes as reliability,
availability, safety, and security. In keeping with the goals of the previous
conferences, the aim of this meeting is to encourage further integration of
theory, techniques, and tools for specifying, designing, implementing,
assessing, validating, operating, and maintaining computer systems that are
dependable in the broad sense. Of particular, but not exclusive interest, are
presentations that address combinations of dependability attributes, e.g.
safety and security, through studies of either a theoretical or an applied
nature.

As a Working Conference, the program has been designed in order to promote the
exchange of ideas by extensive discussions. All the paper sessions will end
with a 30 minute discussion period on the topics dealt with in the session. In
addition to the paper sessions, three panel sessions have been organized. The
first, entitled "Safe Vehicle-Highway Systems" will explore safety
requirements, design methods and validation techniques for computing and
communication subsystems associated with intelligent vehicle-highway systems.
The second, entitled "Malicious and Inadvertent Human Operator Faults" will
explore current and proposed techniques for detecting and countering faults
introduced by the human operator. The third, entitled "Security Issues in
Intelligent Networks" will deal with privacy problems related to the delivery
of intelligent network services and related customer control, along with
network security problems mostly related to open network provisioning.

Advance registration as well as hotel reservation is required. No on-site
registration will be available.
