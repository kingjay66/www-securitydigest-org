Subject: First Day Snafu at Pittsburgh Airport

I left Pittsburgh for a meeting in Chicago on Wednesday, September 30th.  I
returned on Friday, October 2nd.  In between the old Pittsburgh airport closed
and the new one began to operate.  According to a friend who changed planes in
Pittsburgh on opening day (Thursday), things went smoothly.  That may have
been true for folks hubbing at the airport, but for those Pittsburgh bound it
apparently was not.

In order to more easily retrieve my car I had parked with one of the
off-airport parking services.  Upon return I asked the van driver how things
had gone the day before.  He said that everything had gone pretty smoothly,
except for baggage claiming.  He said that delays were around 40 minutes in
the morning, but had stretched to two hours by the afternoon.  The supposed
reason: the airport has a new automated baggage handling system that reads bar
codes off luggage.  A Britsh Air 747 had arrived with uncoded luggage, and the
machinery didn't know how to cope.

Subject: Re: 15th National Computer Security Conference (Mercuri, RISKS-13.85)

>In the quest for tools one encounters the debate on provability and formal top
>level specification. Virgil Gligor referred to "formal top level specification
>as an unmitigated waste of time," saying that data structures and source may
>not map to the top level, there may not be enough relevant details provided,
>and excessive false illegal flows may occur. ...

A point of clarification: He didn't say that formal top level specifications
were a waste of time, but that doing covert channel analysis on them was an
_unmitigated_ (his emphasis) waste of time.  His point was that you had to do a
CC analysis on the source code anyway (since channels would appear in code that
didn't show up in the specs).  Since any channel found in the analysis of the
spec would also be found in the analysis of the code, and you have to do the
latter, anyway, doing the former is not useful.  (This, of course, flies in the
face of the principle that it's much cheaper to find a bug found early in the
development process than late, but that's another discussion.  Perhaps doing
the covert channel analysis is more expensive than fixing a specification bug
when you are done with the code.)

On another topic...

I think that the most surprising new proposal came in the session on the FBI's
Digital Telephony Initiative.  (This is the proposed legislation that would
require telephone and data transport providers to build wiretap capabilities
into their systemms.)  Someone pointed out that the really bad guys would just
use encryption for their data transmission, and that wiretapping wouldn't gain
any information on them.  (The FBI doesn't want to deal with encryption right
now.  They'll think about that when (if) they get the current proposal passed.)
Dorothy Denning suggested that anyone using high-level encryption over a public
network be required to register their encryption keys with some agency.  This
agency would then distribute the keys when an appropriate court order was
presented.  The risks of this are fairly obvious.

                          Final Programme

          European Symposium on Research in Computer Security
                November 23-25, 1992, Toulouse, France

Computer security is concerned with the protection of information in
environments where there is a possibility of intrusion or malicious
action. The aim of ESORICS is to further the progress of research in
computer security by establishing a European forum for bringing
together researchers in this area, by promoting the exchange of
ideas with system developers and by encouraging links with resear-
chers in related areas. To achieve this aim under the best condi-
tions, ESORICS 92 will be a single track symposium and the selected
papers will be presented in a conference hall whose capacity is 290
attendees. ESORICS 92 is the second symposium of a series started
with ESORICS 90 held in Toulouse in October, 1990.
