Subject: Re: TCAS

According to a report that was just on CNN, the problem was that the pilot went
the wrong way, i.e, TCAS told him to go up and he went down.  In the report
(which was surprisingly good) they also mentioned that the controllers hate
TCAS because they lose control and that the pilots love it because they gain
control.  The people interviewed on the report that appeared disturbed by the
incident were controllers so it is difficult to really know how serious it
actually was.

   According to the AP, a ``Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System'',
   designed to prevent mid-air collisions, apparently malfunctioned and nearly
   caused one.  Two planes, a 767 and a DC-9, were separated by 1,000 feet of
   altitude, in accordance with FAA regulations.  But the TACAS system told 
   the pilot of the 767 to descend to the DC-9's altitude.  The horizontal 
   separation of the planes was only .5 miles, rather than the 5 miles required.
	 
This message is incorrect.  There was a good report on CNN, and I also spoke to
a friend at the FAA.  The pilot sighted the other plane visually before the
TCAS alert and mistakenly thought the plane was at the same altitude.  He
descended.  From everything the FAA can determine, TCAS gave a correct advisory
and did not "malfunction."  The pilot says that he does not remember what the
TCAS advisory was but that his maneuver came before the advisory and was based
on his visual sighting.

If you read about TCAS, you need to be aware that it is in the midst of a big
political struggle.  The pilots love it (there was a representative from ALPA
on the CNN report).  The controllers hate it.  According to my friend in the
TCAS office at the FAA, the data released by the controller's union about TCAS
problems and printed in some newspaper reports of this recent incident is just
not correct.  So watch who is speaking when you hear about TCAS and its
problems or advantages.

In case there is anyone who doesn't know, my Ph.D. students (Mats Heimdahl,
Holly Hildreth, Jon Reese, Ruben Ortega, and Clark Turner) and I are working on
a formal system requirements specification of TCAS II.  This will serve as the
official FAA specification of TCAS and also as a testbed application for their
dissertations on safety analysis and risk assessment.

Subject: TCAS

 In the version of the TCAS story I saw locally about the 2 USair jets
near-miss, it mentioned that for the period june -June of the previous year,
over 60% of the warnings/advisements from TCAS systems nationwide have been
erroneous. Many of these have been of the same sort reported -- the system told
two planes that were "safe" to maneuver into an "unsafe" flight path....

Subject: The Glitch Telephone Network

The current issue of The New Yorker (7 Sept 1992) has an item in The Talk of
the Town on the Glitch telephone network.  Call 212-228-7514 and get a "glaring
light each week on some dark alley that science is currently leading us down.
In the past several months, Glitch has alerted us to the hazards of computer
technology, the vulnerability of telephone privacy, and the folly of the
high-speed chase."  

I called Janet Pensig, who runs this line.  Her message of the week deals with
polymorphic viruses.  She also notes that The New Yorker fabricated all sorts
of quotes and missed the content of what she was saying.  She is said by the
article to be "deeply pessimistic about the future", which she says on the tape
is not at all what she told them!  I left her a message, and when she called me
back I discovered that she has been faithfully reading the RISKS section of the
ACM Software Engineering Notes, as well as Inside Risks in the CACM.  She is
very serious about what she is doing.  This seems like a wonderful educational
opportunity for new yorkers (lower case to distinguish them from the magazine).

The Talk of the Town writer ended the last paragraph of the item like this:
"We knew that ... we would never know the true face of doom -- so we just
thanked her for her time and told her that we now felt much worse."

Check out Glitch if you wish.  PGN 

                  [The NYer item was called to my attention by John Rushby,
                   who got to his issue before I got to mine...]

Subject: Phone Hackers

By David Ashenfelter, Detroit Free Press Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News 

DETROIT--Sept. 1--In the late 1980s, high-tech pranksters got their kicks by
breaking into unprotected computer systems.  Then, they infected computers with
harmful binary viruses. Today, hackers are wreaking havoc on computerized
telephone systems. "It's a big problem and getting worse," said John Haugh, a
Portland, Ore., a telecommunications expert who estimated that hackers are
responsible for about $4 billion a year in toll fraud.  "Once they get inside
the system and get a dial tone, they can make phone calls all over the world,"
Haugh added. "By the time the customer gets his phone bill, the criminals are
long gone."

The Detroit Newspaper Agency (DNA), publisher of the Detroit News and Detroit
Free Press, recently became a victim of one variation of the telescam.  Three
months ago, DNA employees started finding strange messages in the company's
computerized voice mail system. The messages were intended for someone else and
were left by callers who identified themselves as "Black Lightning," "Phantom,"
or "Plastic Man."  What initially appeared to be a glitch in the voice mail
system turned out to be the work of a hacker who broke into the message system
through a dial-in maintenance line, said DNA telecommunications manager Ricardo
Vasquez.  Once inside, the hacker cracked the system administrator's pass code
and set up scores of voice mailboxes for friends and associates who dialed in
on the DNA's toll-free number.

Later, officials at Shell Oil Co. in Houston and Shearson Lehman Bros. in St.
Louis notified Vasquez that their voice mail systems had been penetrated by
hackers who left messages urging their friends to call a mailbox at the DNA.
"We were lucky," Vasquez said. "Our losses amounted to only a few hundred
dollars for calls on our toll-free phone line."  He said the company's losses
would have been far worse had the system been equipped to allow the intruders
to make worldwide long-distance calls on DNA phone lines.  Vasquez said the DNA
does not plan to request a criminal investigation because losses were small.

Officials at Shell Oil and Shearson Lehman declined to comment.  Michigan Bell
security employees referred inquiries to the public relations staff, which, in
turn, referred inquiries to the Tigon Corp., an Ameritech subsidiary in Dallas
which sells and leases voice mail systems.  "It is a growing problem and people
need to be aware of it," said Tigon spokesperson Jill Boeschenstein. "In most
cases, hackers try to get in to have some fun and fool around with the message
system.  "The real expense comes when they're able to make outgoing calls that
the company ends up paying for. That can be a considerable sum before company
realizes what is going on."  Boeschenstein said companies that buy or lease
voice mail systems are responsible for unauthorized usage. She said companies
can protect their phone systems relatively easily by using longer pass codes
and disconnecting maintenance phone lines which enable system administrators to
operate the system from a remote location. Boeschenstein also said companies
should do a more thorough job of monitoring their systems.

Telecommunications expert Haugh, whose company interviewed more than 400
toll-fraud victims or near victims, said the most sinister telephone hackers
break into a phone system and set up hidden mailboxes, then sell them to drug,
prostitution and child pornography rings that want to make free calls that are
hard to trace.

Hackers also market mailboxes to nationwide rings which sell long-distance
phone calls for $10-$30 apiece from pay phones on the streets of large U.S.
cities. Haugh said many of the customers are immigrants who want to call
relatives in their homelands.

A favorite time for hackers to sell phone service is on weekends when companies
aren't using or monitoring their phone systems, some of which are capable of
handling hundreds of long-distance calls simultaneously.  Haugh said one
nationally-known manufacturer which he declined to identify belatedly
discovered that it was on the hook for $1.4 million worth of long distance
calls made on its phone lines in just one weekend.  And after companies are
victimized, they rarely are willing to discuss it publicly.  "They're afraid of
bad publicity or liability and in almost all cases their fears are unfounded,"
Haugh said. "It's a very foolish attitude. Until the problem becomes better
understood, other companies aren't going to do enough to protect their systems
from abuse."
