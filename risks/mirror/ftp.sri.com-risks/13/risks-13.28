Subject: "British plug in" 

This is so absurd I should consider submitting it to rec.humor.funny.  My guess
is a lot of companies put plugs on anyway and the law finally caught up - I
just can't imagine it any other way.

         The British Plug In (San Jose Mercury News, 2 Feb 1992)

  Britain has just announced that makers of electrical appliances in that
country must begin to attaching plugs to the ends of electrical cords.
  Britons, for we don't know how long, have been required to buy plugs and
attach them to their new toasters, irons and electrical what have yous.
  But now the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, citing its
research into the matter, says it was surprised to learn that "it is common
practice everywhere else in the world to sell electrical goods with a plug
attached."

Subject: Airport parking is expensive, but ... [this is ridiculous]

One of the San Diego off-airport parking outfits gave me a "time in" ticket
dated February 30 (you can guess the real date).  When I returned to retrieve
my car on March 6th, I was presented with a demand for $3771.00 (at $11/day,
$1/hour), to be paid before I was allowed to leave the lot.  The garage
attendant decided that this wasn't quite right, reentered the date into his
"computer", and was again told that I was to pay $3771.00.  At this point the
manager was called for help (the exit line was getting quite long).

I have a receipt here for $3771.00 for "parking".  The travel accounting people
are going to have fun with this one... :-)

The item below is reprinted in its entirety, from today's Independent, a UK

cases of in-house "high-tech" cash dispenser robbery - but I must admit I have
not followed the stream of cash dispenser stories closely.

ROBBER 'FOILED BANK SYSTEM'

An electronics expert stole more than (pounds) 17,000 in a high-tech
robbery spree, plundering dozens of accounts from automatic cash dispensers
at banks, Paisley [Scotland] Sheriff Court was told yesterday.

Clydesdale Bank chiefs claimed their dispensing system was foolproof and told
angry customers that members of their own households must have been responsible
for making withdrawals without their knowledge.

Anthony Pratt, 32, a bank engineer, used a hand-held computer inside bank
premises to record transactions being made by customers at "hole-in-the-wall"
machines outside.  He recorded the customer's secret number and later used it
on plastic cards he made with magnetic strips.  Pratt, of East Kilbride, was
finally arrested after he took cash from a machine in Glasgow.  He admitted
conspiracy to rob and robbery. Sentence was deferred for reports until 2 April.

Subject: X-15 reliability experience

On reading the Proceedings of the X-15 First Flight 30th Anniversary
Celebration (NASA CP-3105, Jan 1991), I ran across a section of some relevance
to Risks.  Insertions in [] are mine.

	In 1962, a very comprehensive, but little known, study was
	initiated by Bob Nagle at AFFTC to quantify the benefits of
	having a pilot and redundant-emergency systems [this seems to
	be essentially a buzzword for "redundant systems"] on a research
	vehicle.  Each individual malfunction or abnormal event that
	occurred after B-52 [X-15 launch aircraft] takeoff for the
	first 47 free flights of the X-15 was analyzed.  The outcome
	of each event was forecast for three hypothetical models;
	one with only the pilot but no redundant-emergency systems,
	one with only the redundant-emergency systems but with no pilot,
	and one with neither the pilot nor redundant-emergency systems
	(i.e. single-string [buzzword for no redundancy], unmanned).

	[The bar chart of results shows an expected failure rate of over
	50% for the "neither" configuration, with many of the failures
	destroying aircraft.  Adding just a pilot or just redundant systems
	produces only small improvements.  Adding both takes the failure
	rate down to near zero and eliminates aircraft losses.]

	[Referring to the graph.]  The unmanned, single-string system
	would have had 11 additional aborts and resulted in the loss of
	15 X-15s.  [The actual program built only three!]  Not surprising
	is the fact that the pilot is of little value in a system
	without redundant-emergency systems.  He must have some alternate
	course available in order to be effective.  The redundant-emergency
	systems were also found to be of little value in an unmanned
	system primarily because the fault detection and switchover logic
	must presuppose the type of failure or event.  For example, few
	designers would have built in a capability to handle an
	inadvertent nose gear extension at Mach 4.5.

	[That last refers to something that actually happened to an X-15.
	Landing gear is normally designed to be extended at a maximum
	of a few hundred MPH.  Having gear extend at 3000+ MPH is a
	horrifying prospect, but the X-15 was landed safely with minor
	damage to the aircraft and the pilot unhurt.]

	Of more than academic interest was a parallel, but independent,
	study conducted by Boeing on the first 60 flights of their
	BOMARC missile, an unmanned, single-string, ramjet-powered
	interceptor.  The authors collaborated on the ground rules for
	the study but not on the actual analysis.  The similarity of
	the results [a virtually identical bar chart] is striking,
	especially when considering that the X-15 study was projecting
	from a piloted, redundant design to an unpiloted, nonredundant
	design, and the BOMARC study was the reverse...

COMPUTER SYSTEMS DEVELOPED FOR AIRCRAFT ARE BEING ADAPTED FOR USE ON THE ROAD.

Susan Watts reports

CAR FIRM FORGES AHEAD WITH DRIVE-BY-WIRE PROTOTYPE

SAAB, the Swedish car maker, seems untouched by recent controversy over
fly-by-wire aircraft, and is pressing ahead with plans for a drive-by-wire car.
Fly-by-wire aircraft rely on software controls to a far greater extent than
conventional aircraft. Three fatal crashes of the A320 aircraft have raised
fears over the safety of such systems, and how easy they are to fly.

Saab's parent, the Saab Scania Group, has experience of computer-controlled
transport, having built the Grippen fly-by-wire fighter aircraft. Its
automotive engineers have produced a prototype computer-controlled car. The
Independent took a brief test drive yesterday.  The car felt very smooth to
drive, and remarkably easy to handle, although we did only a few miles an hour.

Saab concedes that safety fears could be one of the biggest obstacles to
selling such a radical change in car design. But it predicts that by the time
the car is in production people will be more confident about
computer-controlled transport.

There is no steering wheel, but a joystick to one side of the driver. There is
no mechanical link between the joystick and the wheels a computer intervenes to
control and optimise the hydraulic steering.  The car has a back-up control
system that performs the same basic tasks as the computer, but uses traditional
electronics. This is ready to switch into action if any part of the computer
fails, or the driver hits an emergency "stop" button.  To steer, the driver
turns the joystick from side to side, and the computer translates this into
wheel movement. The car senses the driver's movements on the joystick,
translates these into the optimum wheel angles and feeds back information to
the driver by altering the response felt through the joystick. At low speeds,
for manoeuvres such as parking, a small movement of the joystick produces a
large change in direction of the wheels. At higher speeds this relationship
changes, so a larger movement of the joystick is needed to shift the wheels.

The prototype has a computer keyboard and flat-screen display in the passenger
seat, so the driver can modify the software to change the "feel" of the
joystick. Per Branneby, the Saab test engineer who heads the steer-by-wire
project, said: "I can make it feel like a go-kart or an American limousine."

The idea is that driving without a steering wheel is physically safer, because
you can fit an airbag where the steering wheel would be and avoid the crushing
injuries often sustained by drivers in accidents.

It should also be safer because the computer and hydraulics in between the
wheels and the joystick filter out "noise" from the road that would normally
make the steering wheel shake and judder such as stones in the road or gusty
winds.

Mr Branneby said drivers get most of the information they need to steer the car
by monitoring sideways forces on their seat. In the Saab car, the computer is
fed data from sensors that tell it about these forces, as well as the car's
speed and acceleration.  The car does not sense the environment it is in, so
cannot respond automatically and change its steering to deal with a bumpy or
icy road, or a skid. This is the next stage in Saab's research.

The two-litre Saab 9000 Turbo used to test the active steering has automatic
gears and anti-lock brakes and a conventional accelerator, although Mr Branneby
said these may eventually be linked to the central computer. He does not
envisage production models of cars using steer-by-wire joysticks until 2010 or
2015, although a version with active steering applied to a conventional
steering wheel may come sooner. He also said a production model would probably
have two joysticks one for each arm so the driver can swap the arm in control.

Subject: Corporate Strategies for Information Protection, Ethics and Privacy

As the Conference Program Director, I would like to invite readers of RISKS to
attend an important upcoming executive briefing entitled  

        AVOIDING MANAGERIAL LIABILITY: DEVELOPING CORPORATE STRATEGIES FOR      
        INFORMATION PROTECTION, ETHICS AND PRIVACY

        Sunday evening, April 26 and all day Monday, April 27, 1992 at Bentley  
        College, Waltham, Mass.           

        Sponsored by the Center for Business Ethics at Bentley College 
        

Managers are on the hotseat.  They are increasingly being given responsibilities
for information protection, ethics and privacy issues.  The emphasis of this
briefing will be on how managers can best respond to these challenges.  

Technological developments are intensifying protection, ethics and privacy as
business problems.  The Federal Sentencing Guidelines and other legal decisions
are defining senior managers as directly responsible for developing corporate
conduct rules and programs to deter organizational and employee wrongdoing.  The
media and public opinion are more clearly defining appropriate and inappropriate
activities.  

Managers need assistance to understand these complex issues and to select
appropriate business policy choices.  Those attending this briefing will:

        Evaluate information protection, ethics and privacy issues in           
        managerial/business terms;

        Hear successful policy choices, options and tradeoffs;

        Learn how to respond appropriately to these issues;

        Have an opportunity to network with peers from around the nationa who   
        are facing similar decisions.

John Poduska, a respected figure in the computer field, will give the keynote
address on Sunday evening.  On Monday, there will be overview presentations on
technology, law, and ethics strategies.  Joe Murphy, co-editor of Corporate
Conduct Quarterly, will give a luncheon speech on the Federal Sentencing
Guidelines.  Small interactive discussion groups will be formed to evaluate
scenario and to discuss specific strategies.  The day will end with general
sessions and idea exchanges.

The fee for this exciting day-and-a-half conference will be $300.  That includes
the program, a reception, all meals and informative briefing materials.

For further information, contact the Center for Business Ethics, Bentley
College, 175 Forest Street, Waltham, MA 02154-4705, (617) 891-2981.  Specific
questions can also be sent to me by E-mail at MCI Mail 396-5782.

The backlog is excessive, I was overly busy, and our computer systems suffered

another issue.  Sorry for the delay.  However, the backlog is mostly second-

Subject: Mice do roar! was re: Mouse restrictions on American Airlines

[John Bartlett tells of his encounter with a flight attendant over the
regulations restricting the use of external mice (mouses?)]

Just 2 weeks ago I attended the RFI emission testing of our one of our
X terminals and where did the major emission come from?  If you guessed the
mouse then you're right.

A major source of emissions from equipment in the VHF band is the
cables.  They act as antennas, radiating whatever noise is on the circuits
that connect to them.  Mouse cables are often the worst offender since they
are rarely shielded.

So there is a very definite technological basis for this regulation but
perhaps the problem could be covered better.  I would prefer to see the
regulation require that the mouse have FCC class B or CISPR 22 class B
approval if this reduces the RFI levels to suitable levels.  If this does
not remove the problem then a new more stringent standard needs to be
developed.

But if a lower level of RFI is required, then why don't the laptops
themselves interfere with navigation instruments ? It is risky in the least
to assume that removing the mouse will turn an FCC class B laptop into a
significantly quieter device.

(By the way, leaving the mouse plugged in will most likely still radiate 
regardless of whether it is used or not.)

Subject: Re: Mouse restrictions on American Airlines (Frankston, RISKS-13.26)

But there very well may be [a difference]. I have seen cases in which
*significant* interference was radiated from an external mouse cable [into a
nearly audio input, as it happened]. All it takes is the airline running into
one such case, and they will tend to ban the entire class of device. Such is
the reasoning which [correctly, in my view] led to the banning quite a few
years ago of "pin printers" on airplanes. When I would ask if I could use my
portable computer [back then it was required that you ask], the answer was
always, "Yes, but not if it has a printer on it." Seems the output drivers for
the pins radiated a lot. These days, the boogyman de jure may be external mice.
I don't doubt that they've seen at least one such case...

Subject: Re: Mouse restrictions on American Airlines (Frankston, RISKS-13.26)

There is a potentially big difference.  The wire leading to the mouse could
make a wonderful transmitting antenna through which the RF soup in your
shielded computer might leak out.  Remember that it is only by the airline's
good graces that you're allowed to use the computer at all.  Electronic devices
such as computers, radios and TV's are all potential sources of RF interference.
Only radios and TVs are typically banned because of the specific way in which
they interfere with VOR recievers.  My guess is that American has traced
some interference to the use of a mouse.  Other airlines can't be far behind.

Let's find ways to cooperate before the NTSB has to put the use of a mouse as a
probable cause for an accident.  I'd rather know that the aircraft's navigation
equipment is working without interference than use a mouse.  But then I *am*
typing this on a PowerBook.

Subject: Antennas

To all of you pointing out that a mouse cord can act as an antenna.  Yes, I
know it is possible, but was just passing on another's comment and didn't want
to confuse the issue by adding my own editorial commentary.

While I realize that air safety is a crucial issue, the airlines should have 
some of the burden of establishing a rational policy .  If there is a 
significant danger from mouse cords, then they should explain and 
substantiate it.  Otherwise, I'll confine all my flying to red-eyes since 
I'll have to treat airplanes as being good only for sleeping.  If I'm awake, 
who knows what damage I'd do.

On a slightly more serious note, are the electronics in airplane's all that 
fragile?  Is a laptop computer really worse than a thunderstorm?  Are 
camcorders allowed?  Handheld LCD games?  Flashbulbs?  As our electronics 
become more mobile, the airlines have an opportunity to be compete the for 
the best environment.  Some will provide travellers with better ways to work 
while travelling while others will offer an electronics-free environment for 
relaxation.  Of course, the nonE flights would mean you can't even write a 
letter home without learning how to write with a pen (remember those?)
