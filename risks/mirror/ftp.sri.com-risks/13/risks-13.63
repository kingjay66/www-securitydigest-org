Subject: Newsweek Vincennes article

I'd be interested in comments on its accuracy.

I won't comment on the larger issues of the "if it moves, shoot it" mentality.
But as a systems designer I can understand the compromises made to meet the
specs, but two small points stick in my mind.

One is the image of a technician madly scanning through a dog-eared issue of
the OAG (the article didn't mention a brand name) to find the Iranian flight.
It's hard enough to not miss an entry when in a quiet airport in a single time
zone.  I realize that tracking civilian flights was not part of the normal
battle plan, but I presume that the system has still not been updated to link
to the civilian airline reservation systems or other such sources of
information.  One change in warfare, which I think the Gulf War illustrated, is
how the commercial technology has, in many ways, surpassed the military.  Of
course, the online airline info might not be accurate which means a delayed
flight could still have been missed.

The other is that the tagging of the plane as an F-14 provided for no level 
of ambiguity.  Even in the heat of battle, can the system cope with multiple 
interpretations of data or does it mindless lock in on a worst case and then 
present it to the befuddled user as fact?

Of course, dealing with ambiguous information from many sources is a very 
difficult problem and, as this incident illustrates, neither the system nor 
the users are up to task.  Conversely, what good is SDI if the incoming 
missiles all follow commercial airline schedules?

   [The article was based on a new report produced jointly by Newsweek and  
   the ABC "Nightline" (and scheduled to be broadcast on ABC on 1 July).  The
   report challenges the official U.S. account, claiming that U.S. forces had
   "provoked the episode".  It also cites Admiral Crowe as confirming that the
   Vincennes was in Iranian waters at the time.  The Pentagon replied that 
   that was true, but only in self-defense.  Source: NYTimes, 2 July 1992.

     For those of you who don't remember the technological aspects of the 
     Aegis system, see my item recounting a discussion with Matt Jaffe in 
     RISKS-8.74 (and a follow-on in 8.75).  For anyone seriously interested 
     in this bit of technohistory, I recommend your rereading the lead item 
     in RISKS-8.74.  PGN]

Subject: Are bank machines private?

   [I just returned from Paris, where I read the following article in the
   "European" newspaper. Hmm...]

PIN Money for Thieves"
 
Italian thieves have managed to pull off the world's most ingenious cash card
fraud. A perfect replica of a bank cash dispenser was glued on top of the real
thing and swallowed cards inserted by unsuspecting customers when they tried to
withdraw money.
 
Police say that the thieves collected 104 cards before staff at the bank, in
Busto Arsizio, near Milan, were alerted.
 
Normally a stolen bank card is useless without the owner's Personal
Identification Number. But the thieves programmed their fake machine to request
the customers' PIN numbers before telling them the card had been accidentally
demagnetized and was being retained.
 
After collecting the cards, the thieves then spent the night withdrawing money
from genuine cash dispensers.
 
A police spokesman said: "The thieves have been having a spree, withdrawing
money with the credit cards and the right PIN numbers. They were obviously
electronics experts."

Subject: Virus consumes clerks at Sears

My mother-in-law is a sales clerk at a Sears store in Everett Washington.  I
saw 25 new CompuAdd point-of-sale terminals in the back room.  They're super
techie, with a small CRT, ASCII keyboard, fancy strip printer, and mag card
stripe reader.  They were supposed to be installed months ago, but apparently
they have a dose of the Michaelangelo virus.

"Michaelangelo?  On a terminal?  Are you sure?" I asked.  Needless to say,
the answer was not too specific.  She said it might also have been on a PC
that configures the terminals, rather than the terminals themselves.  Doesn't
Michaelangelo only strike on one day of the year?  All she knew was that they
were "full of viruses" and could not be installed.

Sears has its share of troubles these days, and apparently it is running so
lean and mean that there is no one in the store with enough computer smarts
to get things cleared up in the intervening months.  So there they sit,
depreciating.  But they'll *sell* you a computer...If you dare...bwah ha ha!

And you thought people who knew what viruses are were scared...

Subject: GI Observations on IT Security Evaluation Manual (ITSEM) V0.2

The Data Protection & Data Security Task Force of the German Gesellschaft fuer
Informatik (GI) has again published a "Statement of Observations" concerning
the IT Security Evaluation initiative driven by the Commission of the European
Communities.

This time the statement had to be made on the Information Technology
Security Evaluation Manual (ITSEM) in its current Version 0.2.
The ITSEM shall give help to evaluators and sponsors working with 
Information Technology Security Evaluation Criteria (ITSEC) and
therefore are related quite closely to them. The current version 1.2
of ITSEC was subject of the last "Statement of Observations" the 
GI Task Force published in February 1992.
Discussion of Criticism on ITSEM shall take place in Brussels
(Belgium) from September 8th to September 10th 1992.

Observations, criticism and proposals on ITSEM V0.2 concentrate on the
following issues:

(1)	Lack of Correction of ITSEC problems
(2)	ITSEC needs much deeper and therefore more improvements than 
	admitted in chapter 1.5.
(3)	Who oversees the Certification Bodies?
(4)	Several Classes of potential attackers are not covered.
(5)	Threats can not be enumerated and must be specified the other
	way round.
(6)	The discrimination between strength of mechanisms in only 3 classes
	(basic, medium or high) is very poor and not adequate.
(7)	Requirements for Tools and Techniques are missing.

The full statement is posted to alt.security, comp.security.misc and 
probably comp.society.privacy.

Subject: Voting by Phone in Nova Scotia

WORLD'S FIRST VOTING BY PHONE: JUNE 20 IN NOVA SCOTIA

After an initial failure on June 6, the Liberal Party of Nova Scotia held a
primary June 20 to elect its next leader: 94% of the 7416 delegates voted, all
with touch-tone phones. Typical turnout for Canadian elections is 60-70%.

The Liberals were issued Personal Identification Numbers by mail.  For each of
2 ballots, voters called one of five 900 numbers corresponding to their choice
of leader, and then keyed in their "PIN number". The computer then checked
their number off so they couldn't vote again. John Savage won on the second
ballot with almost 53% of the vote.

The service was provided by Maritime Telephone & Telegraph and cost each voter
50 cents. The eight-digit PIN numbers enabled one to vote from any billable
touch-tone phone: if you did't have touch- tone, you'd borrow your neighbor's.
Absentee voting was as simple as picking up the phone, wherever you were.

With this success, the Canadian government is considering a national referendum
by phone on the results of their Constitutional Convention, within 6 months.

The Federal Voter Assistance Program of the Pentagon is now considering voting
by phone for servicemen, who had voting by fax from the Persian Gulf. But a
$300 fax machine is overkill when a $10 touch-tone phone will do.  The Program
called the Voting by Phone Foundation of Boulder for their initial information.

The Voting by Phone Foundation is now in a petition drive to put a charter
amendment on November's Boulder City ballot. If passed Boulder would become the
first city in the U.S. to offer the option of phone voting. Please call [Evan
at] (303)444-3596 to help.

The Foundation is holding a demonstration of voting by phone from now until the
November 3rd election. Anyone may call (303)444-3596, 24 hours a day. If you
are registered to vote in Boulder, you will be asked to enter your last name
and birth date for identification.  This limits you to one vote, although not
as effectively as the random PIN number to be used for real elections. A
different question will be asked every 2 weeks, and presidential [... rest
truncated by Evan's mailer?]

Subject: When Cryptography is Outlawed...

When Cryptography is Outlawed, Only Outlaws Will Have Cryptography

The really difficult-to-understand part about the Federal Government's
recent assault on cryptographic privacy is how the Feds think they'll keep
cryptography out of the hands of criminals and Evil Foreign Governments.

Now that the Feds have admitted that they have trouble decoding encrypted
messages, any criminal or Evil Spy with a brain will be rushing to purchase
the equipment.  Criminals are hardly worried about breaking any law that
says they can't keep their deeds a secret, and smuggling the technology into
the country will hardly pose a problem to a reasonably proficient Drug Lord.

Perhaps what the Feds are looking for is a new weapon of prosecution; use of
cryptography is by definition a felony, and widespread use of cryptography
is then by definition racketeering as defined by RICO.  It's like bagging
Capone for tax evasion, when he was too slippery to be caught breaking the
law.  I find this sloppiness unacceptable as a taxpayer.

It's just like illegal weapons.  The crooks have the Uzis and MAC-10s, and
the cops have .38s.  And the streets are nevertheless protected.  I see a
future where the world class criminals profit from breaking our insecure-by-
legal-decree comm systems, preying on us law abiding citizens, while carrying
out their business in unlawful security.

Why can't the spies get wise?  Technology is not static.  If the phone becomes
secure, there must be improvements in bugging or some other spook-versus-crook
technology that could replace this information gathering avenue.

How typical of our freedom-loving government to make keeping a secret felonious.

   [By the way, see the July issue of the CACM, which contains material some of
   which has appeared earlier in RISKS, plus a piece by John Perry Barlow and a
   a response to letters from Rivest, Hellman, and Anderson from John Lyons of
   NIST.  PGN]

Subject: Re: computer-literate children find porn (RISKS-13.62)

That same 15-year-old can see some pretty steamy R-rated movies on his
family's cable TV movie channels, or over at his friends.  He can
trade videotapes.  Many mainstream magazines, such as Vogue, purchasable
over the counter by anyone, contain photographs of partially nude women.

It would be tragic if heavy legal restrictions placed on "computer porn", when
it is so difficult to police users' actions and impossible to monitor all
activity on any moderately large BBS in any case, and when "pornography" is so
readily available to everyone through so many other channels, for many of which
no attempt is made to validate the recipient's age at all.

With the ongoing fusion of communications technologies such as computers,
telephones and television, the restrictions' boundaries would broaden to
encompass more and more of the technologies available to us to communicate
with.  Further, since the technology for copying and forwarding images (video,
PC, etc) is so pervasive, enforcement would be spotty and selective, with many
innocent people, for example those whose systems were unknowingly used to
further these peoples' purposes, caught in the net.

          European Symposium on Research in Computer Security
                November 23-25, 1992, Toulouse, France

Computer security is concerned with the protection of information in
environments where there is a possibility of intrusion or malicious action. The
aim of ESORICS is to further the progress of research in computer security by
establishing a European forum for bringing together researchers in this area,
by promoting the exchange of ideas with system developers and by encouraging
links with researchers in related areas. To achieve this aim under the best
conditions, ESORICS 92 will be a single track symposium and the selected papers
will be presented in a conference hall whose capacity is 290 attendees. ESORICS
92 is the second symposium of a series started with ESORICS 90 held in Toulouse
in October, 1990.
