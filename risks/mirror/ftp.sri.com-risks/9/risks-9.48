Subject: Check inquiry / binary search (Mauney, RISKS-9.47)

Jon Mauney's story about using check inquiries to determine the balance in an
account rang a familiar bell.  My mother once managed several apartment
complexes.  One month a deadbeat tenant gave her a $250 check which bounced.
When the check was returned, my mother used the same method described by Mauney
to determine that the account had a balance of $220.  She then went to the
bank, deposited $30 cash in the deadbeat's account, and cashed the $250 check.
I've always wondered what the deadbeat's reaction was when he discovered what
happened.

Subject: Re: Training programmers (Ridgway, RISKS-9.47)

A friend of mine, in part inspired by my sucess as a programmer, decided to
enroll in a two quarter "Computer Programmer" course of study at a Columbus,
OH, trade school. After a week, she had learned how to turn on an IBM PC clone
without it exploding or chasing people around the room. By the end of the
fourth week she had "learned Lotus." They then proceeded to the complexities of
BASIC. In just a few short weeks, she "learned BASIC." She couldn't describe
any but the simplest of algorithms and had no means of attack for simple
programming problems, but she could tell me all the "command words" in the
language. She dropped out before they got to the crowning achievement of the
program, DBASE III.

All through this time I was incredulous. These people expected to be
programmers. They were told that "starting salery for some programmers is
$35/hr." Yet they weren't even addressing fundemental algorithms, common
approaches to problem solving, or anything more than a Jr. High level "Here is
a word problem. Now solve it." I approached an instructor/administrator at the
school with some of my reservations and was told that they were being taught
"enough to get out into the workplace." What amazed me even more was that my
knowledge of "real programming" far exceeded his, even though my schoolwork was
in Physics, not CS.

No, I would not hire a graduate of such a program. Neither it seems would much
of Columbus. We had subsequent contact with four of the graduates of the
program. Only one had been employed in "computer programming" within four
months of graduation. He had worked for a week on a problem that was entirely
too advanced for him, and been allowed to resign gracefully. (Two were working
as cashiers, the fourth unemployed.)

Subject: Telephone Overload

I discovered that MCI (my default long-distance company) was having a bad
day when I tried to call my folks on Thanksgiving afternoon. I tried four
times in a row, and each time, instead of being connected (or getting a
"sorry" recording), I was patched into other peoples' conversations. What a
failure mode!

After satisfying myself that MCI had a bug, I selected ATT (10288+number)
and made my call. But most telephone users probably don't know how to do
that (despite ATT's best efforts); in the US we have become accustomed to
phones always working right.

(I am not an employee or stockholder of MCI or ATT. MCI usually works fine.)

The following appeared in VIRUS-L digest. I think it definitely closes the
question about circumventing write-protect tabs. I've underlined the important
text.

   Do you _know_ your write-protect tab really works?

   [Ed. This question was discussed a few times on VIRUS-L/comp.virus;
   the consensus was (after reviewing schematic diagrams) that the write
   protect mechanism on PCs (and clones thereof) and Macs is implemented
   in hardware and is thus not circumventable without hardware
   modifications.  Unless someone can produce a definitive, reproducable
   piece of code that can prove otherwise, lets all please consider this
   to be the case.]

I would like to confirm the "Ed." tack-on for IBM PCs, clones, and Macs.
However, early Apple ][s *did* implement this feature in software.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I don't know for sure, but believe that later (=current) Apple ][s,
Ataris, and Amigas perform this function in hardware.

Subject: High error rates (RISKS-9.41)

David desJardins mentions a set of figures I've heard before, to wit

    ... look at neutron-activation bomb detectors, to be installed in
    airports.  They are said to have something like a 3% false positive
    rate. ...  Let's say that it [rate of bags with bombs to bags without]
    is 1 in 30 million ...  That corresponds to 1 million false positives
    for every true positive.  *That* is a high rate of error.  And our
    society has chosen to spend nearly a billion dollars on that system.

I'd question whether a system with such a high rate of error will help, or
whether it might not actually make things worse.  If the operator knows (or
works out from experience, as they certainly will even if they are not told)
that out of every million bags which the system says need looked at by the bomb
squad, only one actually contains anything suspicious, then it must be
painfully tempting to say 'well, I'm in a hurry today, can probably let just
this one through'.  And of course since this will usually be 'right' in the
sense that nothing untoward will happen, it will tend to be self-reinforcing
carelessness.  I can see where such a system might create a false sense of
security based on 'gosh, new technology that can detect any form of explosive'
while in fact increasing the chances of non-detection owing to the 'boy who
cried wolf' syndrome.

In short, while more research is almost certainly worthwhile, I don't believe
that putting this system into service in its present state of development could
be considered a responsible act.  Probably win votes, though.

Most of us seem to understand this intuitively; nonetheless, we consent to have
the debate on the technology, rather than the policy.  We continue this not at
our peril, but at the risk of an orderly society.

Subject: Computer Virus Catalog Index: November '89

The Computer Virus Catalog now classifies 45 viruses (AMIGA:24;MSDOS:15;
Atari:6). Activities are undertaken to make the documents available via servers
in different regions of the world; we hope that we can announce such servers in
the next weeks. If you wish to receive the documents (see Index appended, with
length of the documents given) sooner, please send a short request to the
author.

From: Edward DeHart <ecd@cert.sei.cmu.edu>
Subject: CERT_Tools_Announcement

The Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center (CERT/CC) has
established a new Internet mailing list named CERT-TOOLS.

The purpose of this new mailing list is to encourage the exchange of
information on security tools and security techniques.  The list
should not be used for security problem reports.

The CERT/CC has found that many sites have developed tools and
techniques to improve the security of their systems (e.g. tools to
assist users' selection of passwords that are difficult to guess,
account management techniques, monitors that help detect unauthorized
system access).  Also, several tool developers have expressed an
interest in sharing their work with others.  We hope this mailing list
will spawn new security tool development and allow individual sites to
take advantage of existing work.

The mailing list will not be moderated and the CERT/CC will not
formally review, evaluate, or endorse the tools and techniques
described.  The decision to use the tools and techniques described is
the responsibility of each user or organization and we encourage each
organization to thoroughly evaluate new tools and techniques before
installation or use.

Membership is restricted to system programmers, system administrators
and others with a legitimate interest in the development of computer
security tools.  If you would like to be considered for inclusion,
please send mail to:
        cert-tools-request@cert.sei.cmu.edu
You will receive confirmation mail when you have been placed on the
list.

We ask that the mailing list not be used for file transfers.  If you
