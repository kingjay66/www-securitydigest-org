Subject: NEW YORKER article on library automation

The April 4, 1994 issue of the NEW YORKER had a long article by Nicholson
Baker on library automation: "ANNALS OF SCHOLARSHIP: Discards".  It runs from
pages 64 through 87.  My issue also came with a flyer stapled to the cover
with the headline, "THE TRASHING OF AMERICA'S GREAT LIBRARIES."

Baker reports that when most libraries replace their paper card catalogs with
on-line systems, they simply discard the card catalogs.  Baker argues that the
card catalogs are an irreplaceable resource, and contain much scholarly
content which is not carried over into the new systems.  Baker also argues
that the on-line systems often suffer from poor data quality, and make some
kinds of searches (particularly subject searches) more difficult.

RISKS readers will find much of interest about the difficulties of maintaining
integrity and consistency in very large databases.  Baker reports one instance
where all instances of "Madonna" were replaced with "Mary, Blessed Virgin,
Saint," causing reclassification of recent works by Ms. Ciccone.

Some letters responding to the article appear in the May 2, 1994 NEW YORKER.

Subject: Information Warfare: GM vs VW (cont'd)

>From the Reuter newswire via Executive News Service on CompuServe (GO ENS):

     "BONN, April 30 (Reuter) - The German car manufacturer Volkswagen,
  accused by rival Opel of industrial espionage, on Saturday denied a magazine
  report that incriminating material had been found in the office of an
  employee.
     Der Spiegel magazine said on Saturday prosecutors found a computer disc
  containing plans for a high-tech small car factory in the office of Jaero
  Arthur Wicker, office manager of production head Jose Ignacio Lopez de
  Arriortua."

The article continues with the following key points:

o	Lopez used to work for General motors; he's accused of having stolen
confidential files when he was hired by VW.

o	VW claims the disk has plans submitted to both GM and VW and rejected
by both companies.

o	The situation is under investigation by both German and US authorities.

o	The newest scuttlebutt is that GM has asked German prosecutors to
investigate daughter Begona Lopez, whom they accuse of having stolen a disk
containing information on cost reductions at GM.

  [Comments by MK: sounds like a tabloid newspaper's version of a rivalry
  between movie stars.]

Subject: TechWar: Cell Phone Jamming

>From the Reuter newswire via Executive News Service on CompuServe (GO ENS):

  "KINSHASA, April 30 (Reuter) - Zaire's main cellular telephone company, at
  loggerheads with a rival firm trying to muscle in on its territory, said on
  Saturday its signals were being deliberately jammed. 
     Jim Galan, head of coordination at Telecel, said five or six microwaves
  had been trained on its main antenna for the last four days, drowning out
  many calls made from central Kinshasa."

The article explains that the jamming is making cellular phone use impossible
for Telecel's 4000 Kinshasa users.  It is generally believed that a new
company, Comcell, which is supported by the Zairian government, is using the
frequencies originally assigned to Telecel by that same government.

Legal action is in the works.

SUPREME COURT GRANTS ATTORNEY'S PETITION TO RESIGN PERMANENTLY

       TALLAHASSEE, Oct.13-- The Florida Supreme Court has granted
attorney Laurence A. Canter's petition to resign permanently,
effective November 7, 1988.

       Canter, of 240 North Washington Boulevard, Sarasota, was
charged with numerous violations of the attorney disciplinary rules
including neglect, misrepresentation, misappropriation of client funds
and perjury.

       Several of the complaints against Canter involved his failure
to file the necessary or appropriate documents with the United Stated
Immigration and Naturalization Services in matters of permanent
residency and work visas. In addition, Canter refused to refund
clients' funds and neglected to notify his clients that he has been
suspended from the practice of law as a result of a previous
discipline.

       The Florida Bar further alleges that Canter committed perjury
by filing a false affidavit with the Bar and while testifying under
oath in a deposition. These charges resulted after an audit of Canter's
trust account by the Bar showed that trust funds were held in Canter's
account during the time period when he denied any funds were present.

       Canter was born in 1953 and admitted to The Florida Bar in 1980.

       The resignation without leave to apply is not final until time
expires to file motion for rehearing and if filed, determined. The
filling of a motion for rehearing shall not alter the effective date
of this resignation.

       As an official agency of the Supreme Court of Florida, The
Florida Bar and its Department of Lawyer Regulation are charged with
the administration of a statewide disciplinary system to enforce
Supreme Court rules of professional conduct for all lawyers.

Subject: New firewalls book - a great risk reducer

Cross post to RISKS (via mail submission), comp.security.announce and
comp.protocols.tcp-ip news groups, and a few other various places.  Sorry
if you see this more than once.

Re: Firewalls and Internet Security - Repelling the Wily Hacker.
Ray Kaplan - May 2, 1994

Buy this book!

Gentle folk,

Here is a risk reducer.  With the wholesale rush to Internet connectivity,
it's about time someone sat down and wrote a good book about how to do this
exercise safely!  And, sure enough, Cheswick and Bellovin have done just that,

Heaping superlatives on something of which you are enamored is always
problematic - the possibility of overstatement looms large.  Accordingly I`ll
cut to the chase.  Buy this book!  I do not get any money for saying this - I
just believe you are well justified in getting it on your reading list -
today. In May of this year, Addison Wesley is releasing an excellent new book
by Bill Cheswick and Steve Bellovin: Firewalls and Internet Security -
Repelling the Wily Hacker.  ISBN 0-201-63357-4.  It will retail for $26.95. 
Bulk purchases: 800- 238-9682, individual orders: 800-824-7799 (FAX
617-944-7273).  Email orders over the Internet from bexpress@aw.com (no they
don`t take plastic via Email). For those that are net-challenged, U.S.
snailmail orders from Addison-Wesley, c/o Arlene Morgan, 1 Jacob Way, Reading,
MA  01867 USA. 

Rumors loom large that at least one of the authors (Ches?) will be at Interop
with copious quantities of this work of art.  As dues of superlative
authorship that is destined to be popular, I hope they both get writer`s cramp
autographing! 

Details 

While worthwhile, well written, pace-setting, technically astute works of art
are rare - this is certainly one of them.  I am always hard pressed to
identify any one thing as unique in its decade (especially when the decade is
still in progress). Suffice it to say that this work is the most complete
treatment of firewall technology and experience that is available.  The
availability of this work is exciting news for security firewall builders -
including Internet security firewall builders - and, for the great number of
people that seem to be befuddled by the complexity and the general issues of
interconnecting networks. 

The book 

While my review copy (well dog-eared, now) is a bit dated (March 7, 1994), I
think you can expect that it is close to the book`s final form: a standard
(w=7.5in, h=9in) Addison-Wesley Professional Computing Series book like the
ones that should already dot your shelves.  (I don`t get any money for my
obvious favorable bias toward this series.  My bias is born out of the fact
that the series (Brian Kernighan is the consulting editor for it) contains
great authors and titles like Radia Pealman`s Interconnections - Bridges and
Routers and Richard Sevens` TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume I - The Protocols.) 

305 pages in 14 chapters, appendices, a bibliography, a list of "bombs"
(security holes) and an index. 

Out of the box, the authors set the tone for their work by quoting F.T. Gramp
and R.H. Morris: "It is easy to run a secure computer system.  You merely
have to disconnect all dial-up connections and permit only direct-wired
terminals, put the machine and the terminals in a shielded room, and post a
guard at the door."  This is followed by a detailed discussion of the art
and science of building a firewall. There is so much good stuff here, that all
I can do is list the book`s contents - lest I write a tome which distracts you
from picking up a copy of it ASAP.

buy this book out ASAP. 

Meantime, to whet your appetite: 

- Index - (a well done, 26 pages worth - you can actually find pointers to
what you want to know!  What a concept. 

- TCP ports discussion - a Comprehensive list and reasonable advice on what to
do with them. 

- Bombs - a summarized list of the 43 major security holes that they identify.

- Bibliography - Ahhhh.  19 pages of the best firewalls-related bibliography
that I`ve seen. 

- Where to from here - excellent advice for techies and managers who don`t
want to keep working at the job of firewalling or who simply want to spend a
bit of resources on it only once. 

Kudos to the authors - buy this book. 

Of course - these are my own views, and they don`t necessarily reflect those
of anyone - including my employer.  However, in this case, they probably do.

Subject: Re: Drunk in charge (RISKS-15.80)

While I was a contract programmer at GM/EDS, there was an explicitly
stated policy: it was permissible to drink alcohol, as having a beer
with lunch, but ONLY if one did not plan to return to work that day.
It was stated further that we were obligated to give the customer our
best work, and alcohol was not consistent with that effort.

I understand that British Rail have a policy that no personnel who can affect
the safety of others is allowed to have alcohol in their bloodstream during
working hours - the penalty for violating this rule is, I think, dismissal.
This grouping includes engineering staff involved in the R&D of systems such
as signaling.

This is more than just "drunk in charge of a computer", this is, sensibly IMHO,
"being under the influence of alcohol while capable of influencing the safety
of others". I hope that the next time I fly in a fly-by-wire aircraft or drive
my systems heavy car I can have confidence that the developers of the systems
that could affect my safety applied a similar abstemious regime.

Subject: drunk in charge... (RISKS-15.80)

Driving requires quick response time; electric work requires manual
dexterity.  Alcohol impairs both these things, and as noted, the dangers
are obvious, immediate, and tragic.

Software engineering requires very little in the way of fast responses
or manual dexterity, unless one considers an inordinate number of typos
a serious RISK.

Moreover, the skills which *are* required to write software tend to be
more of the problem-solving variety.  I don't dispute that alcohol dulls
these; however, when you take away one's problem solving skills, the
result is that the problem doesn't get solved.

I seem to vaguely recall an old study in which a group of people, some
of which had been given a couple of drinks, were called upon to solve
arithmetic problems of moderate difficulty, with no time limit.  I
believe the outcome was that those who had had the drinks took much
longer to finish the problems, but their responses were *more* accurate
than the teetotalers, presumably due to their awareness that they were
prone to make errors.

(I would therefore advise project managers to take Friday pub lunches
into account when setting deadlines.)

Incidentally, I'm not sure how one would distinguish between mistakes due to
being under-the-influence and those due to being under stress (perhaps due to
looming deadlines), or simple inexperience or incompetence, or even
honest-to-God oversights.  if the QA system for critical systems doesn't catch
all such types of mistake, there's already a serious problem.  Obviously this
is not intended as an argument against reducing the number of errors to be
found by QA, but still... a bug is a bug.

(I'm reminded of a phrase a colleague used to repeat: "Sure, alcohol
kills brain cells.  But only the weak ones.")

Subject: Boot Prom commits Denial of Service Attack

What is the risk here?  People like to put blame one other systems all the
time.  I see this as only a matter of misconfiguration and miscommunication
among the different system admins.  What do the DEC stations need to run tftp
for?  Shouldn't they be logging in to a non-critical partition?  Shouldn't the
Suns have a similar tcpwrapper installed?  Maybe they should all log to some
central machine, with syslog maybe.  The could be several machines that can
serve a diskless station.  The broadcast allows them to find the right one on
the local network and come on up.  I do not think it is at all fair to try to
blame a hardware manufacturer because the equipment worked exactly as
documented, but that happens not to be the way you want it to work.

From: RISKS-request@csl.sri.com
Subject: Info on RISKS (comp.risks), contributions, subscriptions, FTP, etc.  

 The RISKS Forum is a moderated digest.  Its USENET equivalent is comp.risks.
 Undigestifiers are available throughout the Internet, but not from RISKS.  

 SUBSCRIPTIONS: PLEASE read RISKS as a newsgroup on your system, if possible
 and convenient for you.  BITNET folks may use a LISTSERV (e.g., LISTSERV@UGA)
 with SUBSCRIBE RISKS or UNSUBSCRIBE RISKS as needed.  Users on US Military 
 and Government machines should contact <risks-request@pica.army.mil> (Dennis 
 Rears).  UK subscribers please contact <Lindsay.Marshall@newcastle.ac.uk>.
 Local redistribution services are provided at many other sites as well.  
 Check FIRST with your local system or netnews wizards.  If that does not
 work, send requests to <risks-request@csl.sri.com> (not automated).  

 CONTRIBUTIONS: to risks@csl.sri.com, with appropriate,  substantive Subject:
 line, otherwise they may be ignored.  Must be relevant, sound, in good taste,
 objective, cogent, coherent, concise, and nonrepetitious.  Diversity is 
 welcome, but not personal attacks.  PLEASE DO NOT INCLUDE ENTIRE PREVIOUS
 MESSAGES in responses to them.  Contributions will not be ACKed; the load is 
 too great.  **PLEASE** include your name & legitimate Internet FROM: address,
 especially from .UUCP and .BITNET folks.  Anonymized mail is not accepted.
 ALL CONTRIBUTIONS CONSIDERED AS PERSONAL COMMENTS; USUAL DISCLAIMERS APPLY.
 Relevant contributions may appear in the RISKS section of regular issues
 of ACM SIGSOFT's SOFTWARE ENGINEERING NOTES, unless you state otherwise.

 ARCHIVES: "ftp crvax.sri.com<CR>login anonymous<CR>YourName<CR> cd risks:<CR>
 Issue j of volume 16 is in that directory: "get risks-16.j<CR>".  For issues
 of earlier volumes, "get [.i]risks-i.j<CR>" (where i=1 to 15, j always TWO 
 digits) for Vol i Issue j.  Vol i summaries in j=00.  "dir" (or "dir [.i]") 
 lists (sub)directory; "bye<CR>" logs out.  CRVAX.SRI.COM = [128.18.30.65];
 <CR>=CarriageReturn; FTPs may differ; UNIX prompts for username, password.
 WAIS and bitftp@pucc.Princeton.EDU are alternative repositories.
 risks-15.75 gives WAIS info.  

 FAX: ONLY IF YOU CANNOT GET RISKS ON-LINE, you may be interested in receiving 
 it via fax; phone +1 (818) 225-2800, or fax +1 (818) 225-7203 for info
 regarding fax delivery.  PLEASE DO NOT USE THOSE NUMBERS FOR GENERAL 
 RISKS COMMUNICATIONS; as a last resort you may try phone PGN at 
 +1 (415) 859-2375 if you cannot E-mail risks-request@CSL.SRI.COM .
