Subject: Software glitch snares the Social Security Administration

[from Federal Computer Week, 21 Nov 1994]

The Social Security Administration has uncovered a software coding error
that over the years nickeled and dimed Social Security recipients out of
$478.5 million.  The problem occurred in 1978, when SSA wrote new code
because employers began reporting earnings annually rather than quarterly.
The software program, with its 76 sets of variables, had a few holes in it.
Over 16 years, about 426,000 people did not receive appropriate payment
increases.

CANCELBOT DERAILS ONLINE PROMO
Messages promoting "Netchat," a new book by Michael Wolff, have been
unceremoniously wiped out by someone calling him/herself "Cancelmoose." The
vigilante, who used a program called a cancelbot, worked through a computer
in Finland that enables a mail sender to remain anonymous, and claims to
have performed similar services more than a dozen times in the past.

Subject: Ben & Jerry's expects first loss

According to an article (page F2) in the Tuesday December 20, 1994 issue of
the Austin American Statesman (from the Associated Press) Ben & Jerry's
Homemade Inc. is going to report its first quarterly loss since it went
public.  Quoting some of the relevant to risks part of the article:

        Adding to the bad news, the company said Monday that recurring
        problems in a comuterized handling system will force it to
        delay opening a new, more efficient manufacturing plant in
        St. Albans, Vt. until the middle of next year.  [...]

        "While out earnings have been negatively impacted in 1994 by
        the inefficiencies in the company's production planning,
        purchasing and inventory management systems ... the
        anticipated loss in the current quarter is due primarily to
        lower than expected sales lever," [Ben & Jerry's President
        Chuck] Lacy said in a written statement.  [...]

        At the new St. Alban's plant, a computerized system that was
        supposed to automate handling of ice cream after it has been
        packed into pints has software problems, forcing the company
        to substitute a more conventional system.
	That likely will require installation of different equipment
        and more employees for handling, although the company said it
        will still be more efficient than current manufacturing.

	The St. Albans plant is designed to consolidate all of Ben &
        Jerry's manufacturing in Vermont again.  The company hires
        Edy's [a major competitor] of Fort Wayne, Ind. to make about
        37 percent of its ice cream, [Ben & Jerry's spokesman Rob]
        Michalak said.

Subject: Proliferation of Cockpit Warning Signals

The avionics thread seems to have gone quiet, perhaps because none of the 
several recent airliner crashes has involved an A320 aircraft. Here is an 
account of an incident I came across recently which highlights the problem 
of proliferation of warning signals in complex human-machine interfaces.

The incident involved a Continental Airlines 727 which came perilously 
close to landing gear-up at Chicago O'Hare about a year ago.

Initial investigation indicated that the crew had become distracted 
from their landing check-list by TCAS (Traffic Collision Avoidance 
System) warnings which sounded repeatedly as they flew through the busy 
airspace around O'Hare. The 727's gear warning did not trigger because 
the flap setting was 25 degrees instead of the usual 27.5 (in order to 
maintain speed on approach as requested by air traffic control). A ground 
proximity warning did sound at 500 ft, but lack of gear is only one of 
a number of possible causes for this warning.

A taxiing American Airlines pilot saw the 727 on short final with no gear. 
The tower radio transcript makes hair-raising reading:

	American:	"Tower, Continental's got no gear!"

	Tower:		"Who's got no gear?"

	American:	"Continental, just about ready to touch down 
			on two-seven left"

	The ground controller shouted to his colleague who was controlling 
	Continental's approach, who warned:

			"Go around, go around Continental. No gear!"

The 727 succeeded in executing a go-around, but not before scraping the rear
third of the fuselage on the runway. It landed normally out of the second
approach.

Subject: Year 2000 date problems already happening now

A few months ago, there was an excellent article in RISKS about the problems
of the year date rolling from xx/xx/99 to xx/xx/00 and how it could affect
computer systems. Today I mentioned the article in passing to a rep at
my local bank as I was making a routine deposit.  She said:  "It's happening
already."  Apparently there is a problem with some of the credit cards
they have been issuing to their customers.  The expiration date on them
is the year 2000, and for some tech reason she could not explain, two
major stores here in town refuse to take them "because that weird date
messes up their computers."  

I regret that I cannot offer more info than this, but it is serious food 
for thought...

Subject: Re: Prevention of Oral Hacking

   I am a big fan of Voice Recognition Technology, however trite
and useless people may say it is.  And one thing that people have
failed to mention so far that there are ways to prevent/discourage
oral hacking (at least with Macintosh's general program).
   With the Mac program there is an option that allows the user to 
name the computer something other than "Computer."  There is another
option for setting an "Attention Key" to basically give the program
earplugs until that key is pressed again.  There is also a voice
recognizing option that sets how precise your language must be.  
   It is doubtful, at least to me, that somebody running around the 
office yelling "Computer, Restart, Yes" would restart my Mac, whose 
name is Alfred, has the precision level set rather high, and also
has the voice recognition asleep until i press Keypad-0.

Subject: Re: Pentium FDIV problem - so what's new? (Peterson, Risks-16.66)

It occurs to me that the English vocabulary might be related to why
people have reacted so strongly to the existence of this bug -- which,
let's face it, is not all that devastating *relative to other bugs*.
The term "computer" suggests that computation is the most important
and fundamental thing that the machine does, and because of this, any
bug directly related to computation is seen as more serious than others.

In French the machine is called an "ordinateur", which is related to our
word "ordinal" and conveys connotations of *organizing* data.  What we
mostly call computer science, they call "informatique" -- the study of
information.  And if you think about what computers are used for today,
you will see that these terms are at least as fitting as the English ones.
In English when we really mean that computation is the important part of
the work, we use terms like "numerical" in addition to "computing".

Would English speakers have reacted equally strongly to a -- no pun intended
-- comparable bug in the instructions for comparing and branching?  I think
they would not.

(No, you don't need to tell me that a large part of the reaction in this
case was to Intel's reaction, not to the original problem.)

Subject: Intelligent Commentator on McNeil-Lehrer

A recent McNeil-Lehrer report (I'm pretty sure it was Tuesday night's  -- 
12/20/1994) had an intelligent commentator as an interviewee on the Pentium 
situation.

I agree with his comments about the Pentium (that the problem was probably
more severe than Intel admitted and less severe than IBM trumpetted), but
the reason I'm pointing this interview out is because Robin McNeil asked
something to the effect, "So the issue is also that we shouldn't trust an
answer just because the computer gave it to us?"  The interviewee answered
that this was just so, and that we should keep asking for and demanding
proof that the computer is giving good answers.

There were also what I thought were intelligent comments on the difficulty 
of thoroughly testing such complex parts, and that testing had to involve 
strategies to maximize the confidence obtained.

I hope that one of your other submitters has given (or will give) the 
identity of the interviewee, and some exact quotes.  I was impressed by his 
grasp of the big picture, and that he managed to convey it to the 
interviewer, too.  (I think the choice of interviewer helped, but even 
intelligent interviewers can't be prepared to understand all issues, and 
McN-L tend to have more news on political and economic issues than on 
technical issues).

Hope you caught the interview, too!

Subject: Financial Payment Systems
 
In regards to RISKS-16.64 here are some thoughts and concerns about
financial payments on the World Wide Web, CommerceNet, the Internet, and
electronic media in general:
 
Debit card payments today require an additional piece of authenticating data
- the Personnel Identification Number or PIN. There are ISO (9564) and ANSI
(X9.8) standards which tell us how to securely formulate a PIN block and
encrypt it using the Data Encryption Algorithm or DEA (X3.92).  Credit card
payments may soon also require the PIN.  However, we have no standards today
telling us how to encrypt PINs using public key algorithms.  True, the
advent of the smartcard may eliminate the transmission of PINs, but not for
a while yet (years?).
 
Speaking of public key cryptosystems, there ARE existing ISO and ANSI
standards available today:
     ISO-CD 11568 parts 4 and 5 just completed the public ballot process.
     ANSI X9.30 part 1 - The Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)
     ANSI X9.30 part 2 - The Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)
     ANSI X9.30 part 3 - Certificate Management for the DSA is completing its
                         public ballot process.
 
However, due to the legal problems between Cylink Corporation and RSA Data
Security on fair licensing agreements for the RSA patents, the matching set
of ANSI standards (X9.31 parts 1, 2, and 3) for RSA may be put on hold by
the Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) X9 - for further details, call:
     X9 secretariat, American Bankers Association (ABA), 202-663-5284
     X9F chairman, Marty Ferris, 202-622-1110
     X9F1 chairman, Blake Greenlee, 203-762-8580
 
Although the standard addresses the DSA, X9.30-3 Certificate Management is
rather generic and deals with the roles and responsibilities of the
asymmetric key pair owners, the certificate authority(s), and the public key
users.  Interesting stuff and can (and should be) used for implementing any
public key cryptosystem.  Copies can be purchased from the ABA (plug).

Subject: Possible solution to the (electronic) meme problem

Keith Henson (RISKS 14.63) points out that computer viruses and human fads
fit Richard Dawkins' concept of a meme, adding

  What computers and fast communications have done is to radically change the
  replication constants for memes, and to make unworkable the controls society
  has tried to put on such things.

In "Mind Viruses" (American Scientist, Jan-Feb 1995, p.26), Michael Szpir
discusses 'human information parasites', such as the St. Jude 1 chain letter,
likened to memes by Dawkins and Oliver Goodenough (Nature, Sept 1, 1994). 

Some years ago, I received an electronic chain letter, complete with lengthy
sequential history of previous senders.  These letters differ from the old-
fashioned kind -- they always have return addresses.  It occurred to me that
the appropriate response was to SEND IT BACK, and encourage the sender and all
others to do likewise, hoping an avalanche of returned mail would eventually
swamp the original sender, if it didn't bring the network to its knees. 

No such luck.  I actually tried it, forwarding the letter back to the
sender with subject LET'S SEND IT BACK.  Unfortunately, he returned it
immediately, longer by two headers, with subject THAT'S NOT FAIR...IT'S
GOT TO BE 5 OTHER PEOPLE.  I did not repeat the experiment, though I tried
unsuccessfully to get others to do so. 

Still, I wonder, next time a chain letter or other intentional meme spreads
through the Internet, if everyone returned their copies to the sender ...

Subject: Advertising on the Net

In the 05 Dec 1994 issue of _Network World_ on p. 41, "John Doe" recounts
his tale of woe after advertising on the Internet ("Ad leads to a nightmare
on Cyber-Street).  In brief, his main points are

* Placed ads in several USENET groups.
* Swamped with email abuse and flames in the groups as a result.
* Someone posted his 800- number in alt.sex groups as a phone-sex #.
* Switchboard swamped with requests for phone sex; operators horrified.
* One switchboard op quit because of what callers were saying.
* All 800- calls switched to the originator of the advertising as punishment.
* Impractical to cancel 800- service because of special letter combinations.

Moral:  don't advertise on the Net.

<<Comments by MK:

One issue is whether it's good or bad to advertise on the Net.

Another is whether it's good or bad to respond to advertising on the Net in the
ways demonstrated in this case.

Yet another is that exactly the same techniques could be used against any
organization even if it _doesn't_ advertise on the Net.>>

Subject: Risk Takers Among Management

Subject: Upper Managements View of Information Security(Infoworld 12/19/94)

The following extract from _INFOWORLD_ 12/19/94 demonstrates some of the
risks inherent in human management. (I read this shortly before reading
RISKS 16.66 and the posts calling for papers and serious work in all areas
of network and computer security).

42% of senior management at U.S. companies consider information security to
be only "somewhat important" or "not important," according to a survey by
Ernst and Young LLP, with 15% of companies devoting no full time resources
to security. This though even more than half the respondents reported
information-related losses.  Also , among respondents who said they were
running "mission-critical applications" on their LAN's, half reported that
security was unsatisfactory. What will it take to make security a priority
in industry? The Stealth bomber blueprint on place mats in Pizza Hut?  (end
copy)

We can only hope that some of the recent antics and activities on the
network cause these top managers to focus some their energies, and resources
on the protection of their (our?) data.  Analysis of all probable problems
and or threats should precede implementation of any changes to or
introduction any systems.  I think most readers of RISKS would enjoy reading
the entire poll and possibly having helped in phrasing some of those obscure
questions, and "open to interpretation answers."

   [I would call it a *parody*.  RISKS readers seem to be a cut above the
   average in terms of not being fooled so easily, especially by such obvious
   parodies.  But remember there are a lot of nontech folks out there with
   very bad spoof-suspicion thresholds.  Even the most *obvious* humor
   sometimes gets taken seriously.  Remember what happened to Piet
