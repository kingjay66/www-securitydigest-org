Subject: Risk of using your own name

Computergram Number 1098 (published by Apt Data Services in London) featured a
story from Newsbytes that illustrates the risk of using your own name to test a
computer program.  Michelle Gordon, training as a police dispatcher in
Bloomfield, Connecticut, was told by her instructor to use her own name as a
test case to see how the computer reports outstanding "wants and warrants"
against an individual.  Michelle did so -- and was shocked to find out that she
was wanted for passing a bad check! Back in July, she had written a $90.97
check to a clothing store, and the check had bounced.  After turning herself
in, she was relieved of duty -- but the police say that she should get her job
back once the bill has been paid.

I'll guess that this radio communications system is the NBS transmissions from
WWV in Fort Collins (which is synchronized to Boulder).

Aside from the obvious risks in designing a system the way this one (the
traffic signals) was apparently done, the transmission code used by WWV is
inherently risky.  There is no parity check on the data in the code. (And only
day of year, not year, which is another story with its own risks.)

Receiving clocks must compare successive samples of the code, which is BCD-ish
and has a one minute cycle, and see whether the samples are in the correct
sequence.  Eventually the clock decides it has correctly read the code.  But if
a static burst or radio fade garbles the same bit in the code for a few minutes
the clock will set to the wrong time.  The Heath "Most Accurate Clock" reads
these transmissions and fails in this way.  A couple of times a year I will see
my clock confidently displaying a time which is EXACTLY 4 hours wrong or
EXACTLY 20 minutes wrong.

Subject: Computer-related accidents in British chemical industry

Here are some interesting examples of hardware-software-user interaction from
the British trade magazine, CONTROL AND INSTRUMENTATION, Vol 20 No 10, October
1988, pps. 57, 59: 

Wise After the Event by Trevor Kletz

... Computer hardware faults do occur. ... Their effects can be reduced
by installing `watch-dogs.' However, an error in a watch-dog card actually
caused one accident --- valves were opened at the wrong time and several
tons of hot liquid were spilt [ref 1].

...In one plant, a pump and various pipelines were used for several different
duties -- for transferring methanol from a road tanker to storage, for charging
it to the plant and for moving recovered methanol back from the plant. 
A computer set the various valves, monitored their positions and switched
the transfer pump on and off.   On the occasion in question, a road tanker
was emptied.  The pump had been started from the panel, but had been stopped
by means of a local button.  The next job was to transfer some methanol
from storage to the plant.  The computer set the valves, but as the pump
had been stopped manually it had to be started manually.  When the transfer
was complete the PES [Programmable Electronic System --- British for computer
control system - JJ]  told the pump to stop, but as it had been started
manually it did not stop and a spillage occured [ref 5].

... Another incident occured on a pressure filter which was controlled by
a PES.  It circulated a liquor through a filter ... As more solid was deposited
on the filter the pressure drop increased.  To measure the pressure drop,
the computer counted up the number of times that tyhe pressure of the air
in the filter needed to be topped up in 15 minutes.  It had been told that
if less than five top-ups were needed, filtration was complete ... If more
than five top-ups were needed, the liquor was circulated for a further two
hours.  Unfortunately a leak of compressed air into the filter occured which
misled the computer into thinking that the filtration was complete.  It
signalled this fiction to the operator who opened the filter door --- and
the entire batch, liquid and solid, was spilt. ... The system had detected
that something was wrong, but the operator either ignored this warning sign
or did not appreciate its significance [ref 2].

... (In one incident) when a power failure occured on one site the computer
printed a long list of alarms.  The operator did not know what had caused
the upset and did nothing.  After a few minutes an explosion occured.
Afterwards the designer admitted that he had overloaded the operator with
too much information, but he asked why the individual had not assumed the
worst and tripped the plant?

... (In another incident) a computer was taken off-line so that the program
could be changed.  At the time it was counting the revolutions on a metering
pump which was feeding a batch reactor.  When the computer was put back
on line it continued counting where it had left off --- with the result
that the reactor was overcharged.

This is actually part of a larger problem.  I recall reading an interview
with a Japanese business-methods type lecturing in the US.  One of the
first things he asks his students to do is solve a simple quadratic equation.
Many of them are baffled; most are offended.  He then explains to them, as
gently as possible, that one cannot do any form of optimization (of costs,
production rate, whatever) without solving quadratics (at least).  North
American business schools, by and large, have the same preoccupations as
North American businesses:  mergers, acquisitions, advertising, and legal
maneuvering, as opposed to making better products at lower cost.  The
problem, increasingly, is not that managers are ignorant of technical
issues, but that they consider them unimportant.  The ignorance is an
effect, not a cause.

I don't think it's "developing" experience: it's spreading experience.
The technology has given us:
 1. online systems (terminals), which led to:
	 - distributed systems
	 - interactive human interfaces
 2. speed, price, reliability, and all that.

I don't think that the failures stem from our progress on Point 1.  We
had online systems in the 1960's.  Those development projects were seen
as big, expensive, hairy projects that entailed risk.  Now that similar
projects are cheap, the difficulty is somehow overlooked. Take, for
example, the municipal system that started this debate. It was unusable
because it did not integrate well into the complex environment that the
projected users were already coping with. We had failures like that in
the 1960's. I would blame our advanced technology, not for raising deep
issues, but for putting big problems into a multitude of small hands.

Subject: Re: Losing Systems

I can add some first hand information about losing systems.  Let me tell
you a story about a data collection manufacturing pacakge I stayed as far
away as possible from.

Background:  This was a marketing intensive company.  This company considers
technical support people expendable.  They would rather lose their experienced
people because programmers/analysts coming out of school are cheaper.  BTW,
they hired on grade point average only.  Not what you know, but what you did in
school.  In my experience, the two are *not* the same.

It was decided we were to develop an off-the-shelf/base package which could be
custom modifiable for data collection/time and attendance functions for the
manufacturing environment.  Because of a recent reorganization, all of the
experienced project leaders and programmers *fled* the company.

Our most experienced project leader (hat was left) had stated he was leaving in
6 weeks because of personal reasons.  Yet the project planning and design was
given to him to do.  Six weeks later, he left, the project design about 30%
completed.  Another person (from another area in the country) was brought in to
complete the design.  Soon after the design was completed, *he* left the
company because of a better offer elsewhere.  Thus, we had no one who
completely knew the entire system design.  Worse, none of the programmers knew
the manufacturing environment, so they couldn't spot any design errors, even if
they stared them in the face.

Since the reorganization made us a profit center, we now *had* to make money.
This, of course, while 90% of our efforts went toward development of a product
which was projected to make money in *two* years.  Because we were in the red,
raises were denied to certain programmers (through no fault of their own), who
in turn did extremely shoddy work in the programs they put together.  (And of
course, left at first opportunity.)  Our regional manager also declared that we
would receive no new hardware, since we couldn't justify the cost because we
were losing money.  Thus, we didn't have the necessary hardware that this
package was supposed to be running on.  (Only later did marketing force our
regional manager to get the equipment.  Much of the equipment belonged to our
certification, verification and testing site.)

Because the project was losing money and behind schedule, programmers were
*required* to work 45 hours per week.  No compensation, no exception.  Several
more programmers *fled* the company.  They hired part time people to fill in
the losses.  (Sorry, can't hire more people.  Can't justify the cost!)

In the scheduling, there was no provision for extensive system testing, or for
the development of test scripts.  More delays, more time and money lost.

Because we were losing money, the company decided our district was expendable
and desolved our group.  We were given the option to move to a medium sized
city in Southern Ohio, where their home headquarters is.  *No one went*.  Thus,
this company had a $300K+ package, somewhat complete (about 250K to 350K
lines), but far from working correctly, with NO ONE ON THE ORGINAL OR
SUBSEQUENT PROJECT TEAMS LEFT IN THE COMPANY! (From the spies I have in the
company, they hired a bunch of college kids straight out of school to complete
the work under 2 experienced project leaders.)

This post details about 40% of the problems encountered during the development.
It doesn't include poor hardware design, or the fact this package is really to
extensive to run on the recommended hardware.  Even with all that went wrong,
this company is still marketing this package today, training people how to sell
it and install it.  (The base package is more or less useless without
modification.)  I'll bet it still doesn't work today.

I think I can summarized why projects fail by the following:

Poor planning and quality control.  By far the worst offender.  How can you
keep within budget and time frame if certain critical events are left out of
the schedule?

Poor management and company policy.  This is probably the second worst
offender, although I'd probably tie it for number one.  Management is only
interested in one thing.  The bottom line.  Does it make money NOW?  (Apologies
to those managers who aren't this way.  But I'll bet if you work for a large
computer corporation, and your year end bonus depends on how much your site
makes, you *are* one of these.)  They must also provide the necessary resources
to get the project done.  This includes keeping your people and treating them
right.  (At least until everything works! :-) Also, managers who know nothing
about the computer biz or the programming environment, should be managing the
sanitation engineers or the cafeteria staff.  They have no business managing
things they know nothing about.

Poor expertise by programmers.  This is not necessarily the programmers fault,
but the companies fault for not providing the education.  (Please note this
assumes competent people! If the human resources department does their work
properly, getting competent people shouldn't be a *big* problem.)  Programmers
should know what they're programming *for* as well as what the programs should
do.  Programmers should also know the project.  I had enough pull and technical
expertise to be involved in *other* failing projects.  (Want to hear others?
E-mail me, and if I have the time I'll detail others.)

Subject:  Failure of Software Projects

Jerry Saltzer suggests that the trouble with software is the speed of advance
in hardware; that the software developer is overwhelmed by the new function and
opportunity.  Else, he suggests, normal engineering discipline would suffice.

I would like to suggest that it would suffice anyway if it were applied.  The
difficulty is that software is managed by programmers, not engineers.
Programmers have no tradition of quality of their own and insist that their
activity is so different from what engineers do, that engineers have nothing to
teach them.

Suppose that you had been an electronics engineer in 1960 but had been out of
the field since.  Don't you think that you would see more product complexity
and risk if you re-entered today?  Engineering discipline has been adequate to
cope there.  It would be able to cope in software too, if only it were
regularly applied.

I am hopeful that the use of the term "case" presages the application of more
discipline in programming.

I also draw hope from the entreprenurial development of software for the
market, as opposed to works built for hire for a single organization.  I saw a
great deal of quality software at Egghead on Saturday.

    Fair enough, but he is describing an understanding which is very prevalent
in the industry... Many managers from the pre-structured era understand
structured programming to be just what was described:  a supposed panacea.

    The academic community does not even know the difference. In faculty "A" of
our major local university, it is understood as a suite of
complexity-management tools, mostly the "mental tool" sort.  In faculty "B" it
is understood, if at all, as a rule-set which is supposed to produce correct
programs.

   Any of my last three major employers contained people who took opposing
views on the meaning of structured programming. What I found significant was
that the people who regarded it as a tool also knew its weaknesses and knew
other tools and techniques.. The people who claimed it was a panacea invariably
knew no other technique for improving program quality.

  It sounds like Bruce worked for one of the snake-oil salesmen and did not
have the opportunity to see it used by a professional or academic software
engineer.  And yes, I agree with him that using it as snake oil has placed us
at risk.

this is essentially true, with the ordinary mind-bending caveats that
probability theory imposes.  if the probability of a single engine failing
is p, then the probability of one of three engines failing is 3p (this is
actually the expected value of the random variable that maps failure to
one, and non-failure to zero, but it'll serve).  p is a real number between
zero and one, by the way.  in this case, we can assume that it's closer
to zero than to one.

the probability of two of three engines failing is 6(p**2), since the
probability of one engine failing is 3p, and the probability of one of the
remaining two failing is 2p, and we multiply (since they're independent
events -- the proof is sort of hairy for our purposes).

all this is true, of course, as long as all the engines are working.  as
soon as one fails, the overall probability of failure changes.  for example,
the probability of two of three engines failing is 6(p**2), as above.  as
we're flying along, one engine fails.  oops.  the probability that another
engine will fail is 2p, and not the 6(p**2) that seems intuitively correct.
airplane engines, like coins, have no memory -- or if they do, it's the
wrong kind.

the risks?  statements like "the odds of ... [failure] ... are much, much
smaller" can be misleading.  the debate here over the likelihood of failure
is evidence of that -- a group of intelligent, educated people can't agree
on the odds.  numbers are tricky in this field, and don't always behave
the way you'd expect them to.

when i was studying this stuff, a friend said to me, "the first thing to do
when a probability theorist asks you a question is to grab him by the throat,
slam him up against the wall, and ask him, 'what do you MEAN?!?'"  this is
good advice.  it's also a good idea to quantify things explicitly -- how
*much* less likely is failure, when you add another engine? -- rather than
to offer imprecise reassurance.

ANY results at all about the stability of the political systems related to that
