Subject: funny sco unix story
 
[...] at sco last week, they told me that their customer service line had
received a call from a US Army dude who was calling from inside his M1 tank in
the Saudi desert.  apparently, SCO Unix runs on one of the computers in the
tank.  the customer service person pointed him to the SCO BBS system and he
dialed it and downloaded the bug fix.

Subject: serious bug in SVR3.2 gives root access easily

I learned last night that the Esix operating system (really AT&T Unix System
V/386 Release 3.2) which I run on my PC at home suffers from the serious
security bug recently reported in comp.unix.sysv386.  Someone posted a 51 line
(commented) program which shows how any user with access to a shell and C
compiler can obtain root priviledges with no effort at all.

I'm not familiar with all the details, but apparently it has something to do
with a bug in the numeric coprocessor emulation library and the os which makes
the user page (where uid information is stored) writable to the process.  The
posted program changes it's own effective uid and gid to zero (becoming root),
and changes the permissions on /etc/{passwd,shadow} to 666 (world writable).

Apparently the bug exists in Esix 3.2, Interactive Unix version 2.02 and 2.2,
and possibly others, but not in SCO Xenix or Unix, nor Intel's Unix 3.2 (these
give memory faults).  Interactive V2.2 users (and possibly some others - not
Esix) can fix the problem by installing a 387, changing the value of one kernel
variable (UAREARW) and rebuilding the kernel.

In my opinion, the rest of us are probably screwed.  I seriously doubt any of
these OS vendors will stop working on SVR4 to fix this bug in SVR3.2, except
possibly for customers who pay for software maintenance.  Many vendors are just
about ready to ship their SVR4 release.  I suspect most will tell those of us
who don't pay for maintenance that we must upgrade to fix the bug.

It just goes to show that it was a good idea when I set my bbs up to run in a
"chroot" filesystem, where even if a user could break out of the bbs program
into a shell, there is no compiler (in fact, there are hardly any useful
commands at all) to mess around with.

Subject: Risks of large disk drives

>From an article in the USENET newsgroup clari.nb.general, announcing a new 
large-capacity Winchester disk drive from Fujitsu:

"You used to have to rely on 8 inch drives for capacity, performance and 
reliability," added [Mike] Gluck [senior vice president of Fujitsu America's 
Computer Products Group].  "Now we have put mainframe reliability into a 5.25 
inch disk drive.  Our MTBF (mean time between failure) is 200,000 hours and the 
advantage to using one large capacity drive like ours over three smaller drives 
is that even if the smaller drives have an equal MTBF, there are three chances 
to have a problem."

I see two risks here:

- As has recently been beaten to death in RISKS, the proffered MTBF figure is
  suspect, unless Fujitsu has actually withheld this product from market long
  enough to test a statistically significant number of samples for nearly 23
  years;

- Mr. Gluck seems to think that having a single point of failure is less risky
  than having three separate (though of course not entirely decoupled) points
  of failure.

Subject: The Risks of Having a Sister (Any well informed sibling will do)

A few years ago, I encountered virtually the same problem with my driving
record.  I went to motor vehicles for my routine license renewal (every
three years), when I noticed on the bottom line a small comment that 
read "Last Conviction Speed In Zone $50".  

I was directed to the violations department, where they quickly
consulted my records on a terminal.  They told me that one year earlier
I had gotten a speeding ticket and evidently paid it.  They told me
that I had other tickets as well.  I was told that if I wanted a list
of 'my' violations I would have to send $5 or so to Albany (NY) and
they would send me a printout.

I discovered that my brother had simply told the police that he was me, and he
did not have his license with him (his was nearly suspended).  He then paid the
tickets.

The Risks are clear:
-  There was no confirmation of my brother's identity.
-  He was able to plead me guilty by mail.  
-  I was not provided with a routine way to review my driving record for 
   possible errors.  
-  The last risk is that I was not able to clean up my record, 
   since the only way would be to turn in my brother to the authorities.

Subject: Re: risks of having a sister

In the states of the USA with which I'm familiar, one must be a licensed driver
to register a car.  This allows a driver's license number to be associated
with, say, unpaid parking tickets.  I don't think that moving violations (say
in the case of a hit&run driver whose plates are observed) can be ascribed to
the owner of the car without other evidence.  But it does seem that such a rule
might be useful in Australia to discourage unlicensed drivers.

From: cm@yarra.oz.au (Charles Meo)
Subject: Re: Risks of having a sister

For non-Australians it is worth pointing out that under unique (and unsuccess-
fully opposed) legislation, the burden of proof has been reversed and police
are empowered to record a conviction _without_ any judicial process whatever
and the driver is then obliged to prove his or her _innocence_ in the matter.

This has enabled local police to generate enormous government revenues as many
traffic infringements are now handled in this way.

I do not know of any other civilised country that would allow this (the spirits
of the old prison governors are alive and well in our seats of government!) and
of course, when this law is translated into computer systems with _no_ safe
guards the situation Robyn has described can happen easily.

Subject: guilty until proven innocent

C. Meo says he `does not know of any other civilised country' that would allow
the burden of proof to be reversed in the event of traffic violations.
Unfortunately, that is becoming more common here as well -- several states have
empowered police to seize licenses of people tho fail breath alcohol tests.  It
then becomes the problem of the accursed -- um, accused, to prove innocence.
Yeah, right.

I know a guy who was stopped for speeding once.  They looked him up and
discovered his license had been revoked, so they carted him off to the police
station and booked him for driving while on the revoked list.  He protested
that (a) he had never been informed that his licence had been revoked, and (b)
he had not done anything that should have caused his license to be revoked.

When his case came to trial, the state readily admitted that both (a) and (b)
above were true.  However, his name was indeed on the revoked list, albeit
erroneously, and he was accused of driving while his name was on the revoked
list, so he should be found guilty.  The judge agreed and found him guilty.
Afterwards, he asked what he might have done to avoid this.  The answer was
that it was his responsibility to check the revoked list to see if his name
turns up there.  He left the state shortly thereafter, and I don't suppose he
has been back since.

Subject: Parking Ticket Notice

     I received from the District of Columbia Government Bureau of Traffic
Adjudication a Notice of Delinquent Parking Tickets today for three tickets
issued in December 1990.  The tickets were all issued to a Volkswagen with
plate number 457-143 in a section of Washington that I have not visited.  I do
not own a Volkswagen.

     Prior to October 1987 I owned a Ford Fiesta with plate 457- 143.  Shortly
before October 1987 I lost the front plate.  Since I was preparing to trade it
in for a new van I did not replace the plate, and did not report it as lost.  I
simply requested a new plate rather than transferring an old plate.  The plate
expired in March 1988.

     Either the plate number was reissued, or someone found the lost plate and
is using it illegally.  If it was reissued, the problem is that the database
shows the wrong name as the owner.  If it was lost and found and is being used
illegally, then the system should have shown that the registration is no longer
valid.  Besides, if that old plate is being used, tickets should also have been
issued for using an expired license plate without renewal stickers.

     The specific RISK here is: "D.C. motor vehicle registration will not be
renewed if you have outstanding parking tickets."  The notice doesn't say that
it only restricts the renewal of this Volkswagen with plate 457-143.  They also
have my name, and presumably know that I now own a 1988 van.  A more serious
risk could arise with a system with this vulnerability in a state where parking
tickets are considered to be petty crimes, in that an arrest warrant could be
issued.  (Parking tickets in the District of Columbia are civil rather than
criminal.  That reduces the risk but doesn't eliminate it.)

Subject: Reinterpretation of the term "Computer Security"
 
Mr Dixon seems to be perturbed that one of the moguls in his business has
determined that all data should be protected rather than just "sensitive
data."  Just who is going to be so totally aware of what the implications of
all data are to make an absolutely correct decision so that all company
sensitive information will be protected.  It is obviously much more secure
and definitely safer to assume that all data has some importance and
therefore should has some measure of protection.  If this is the case then
the data creator/owner or security manager can determine who should have
access to share this data.
 
If all data is protected by default then the error of omission is just an
inconvenience -- if only "sensitive data" is protected then the error of
omission is disclosure of sensitive data and presumably some corporate harm.
 
The security product I designed for large IBM Computer Systems -- ACF2 --
was the first product in that arena to protect all data by default and it
was done with less overhead than the products that presumably protected only
sensitive data.  Given this, there exists no reason to not protect all data
and determine who to share it with rather than guess which data should be
protected or not protected.   Thousands and thousands of computer sites
licensed this package so therefore they also felt that this was the correct
way to do this.
 
The SHARE Security Project Requirements for future data security in IBM
Operating Systems also called for all data to be protected as a default in
1974.  Obviously, Mr Dixon's business mogel is not alone with his
presumptions  -- in fact, I think he's right.
