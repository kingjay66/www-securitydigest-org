Subject: Walking Away From the Medicare Computer Project (Edupage)

The Clinton Administration has terminated the contract with GTE for a new
computer system to handle Medicare because the current system (run by 72
private insurance companies around the country) proved to be so antiquated
and complicated that they frustrated GTE's efforts.  The Department of
Health & Human Services has told GTE to "stop all work, make no further
shipments, place no further orders and terminate all subcontracts."
Medicare officials say they will now work on individual pieces of the system
rather than attempting to do the entire project at once.  (*The New York
Times*, 16 Sep 1997; 16 September 1997)

Subject:  Dyslexic Telephone Switch causes billing errors

Northern Telecom Ltd. stated last week that its widely used DMS-100
telephone switch caused numerous billing errors in many phone company
central offices due to a software bug introduced during a software upgrade
this summer. The software glitch caused the billing interface to become
dyslexic and use the wrong area code in phone company Central Offices
covering more than one area code.  The software snafu was fixed after about
a month of erroneous billings.

Net Users calling their "fixed price" local access number found hundreds of
dollars of overcharges on their telephone bills this summer. The local
number was billed as a toll call with a different area code attached. To add
to the confusion, customers were told by their local telephone company that
the billing problem was with their long distance company or the Internet
Service Provider (ISP). And these companies directed customers back to the
local telephone company. Customers were refused an explanation but were
finally told that it was a "System Error".

Pacific Bell acknowledged that 167,000 Californians, mainly in the Bay
Area's 415 and 510 area codes and 805 near Los Angeles, were billed $667,000
in unwarranted local calls. The problem was also reported by Nynex customers
(now Bell Atlantic) in the New York City area.

I do not understand why [more extensive] testing and some sort of
independent review was not done by NorTel before they released the software
upgrade? The local telephone companies should also have some sort of Quality
Assurance program in place before they allow a contractor to upgrade
software in their Central Offices?

I also do not understand why the local telephone companies did not handle
the problem better in terms of customer service, and inform all possible
affected customer's of the problem?

Subject: GCCS Military Software fails Year 2000 Test

In an article on the front page of the 15 September 1997 {Government
Computer News}, it is noted that the Defense Department's Global Command and
Control System (GCCS) failed when the date was rolled over to the year 2000.

GCCS is used at 500 Department of Defense sites worldwide to provide a
comprehensive battlefield operational picture.  It replaced an older system
in August 1996.

The test was done on 1 Aug 1997 during the Joint Warrior Interoperability
Demonstration (JWID), which is used to show off emerging technologies for
use in Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I)
operations.  Eight countries, including Canada (which has purchased GCCS for
evaluation purposes), are participants in JWID.

There are 28 tests used, including setting the date and time close to
midnight on 31 Dec 1999 and letting the clock roll over, as well as for 28
Feb 2000 and 2001.  In 10 of the 28 demonstrations, software expired or
machines froze.  One system failed to recognize that there is a 29 Feb 2000.
Another had to be rebooted and had erased every user account.

The failure is believed to be due to the underlying operating system. GCCS,
current version 2.2, runs on Solaris 2.5.1, Windows NT, and HP-UX 9.0.7 and
9.0.10.  It is said that systems running on Solaris 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5 are not
year-2000 compliant.  The Hewlett-Packard Unix systems are said to be
compliant and passed the test.  According to Lt. Cmdr. Mark Harvey,
technical director at the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) for the
JWID program, "So anything that was running on HP Unix worked.  Anything
that had Solaris did not."  JWID rejected claims that their software was at
fault, stating that the problem is claimed to be on Solaris versions 2.5 and
below.

Sun questions whether the application is at fault.  John Leahy, government
markets manager for Sun Microsystems Federal pointed out that "Even if the
operating system is year 2000 compliant, that doesn't automatically mean the
applications that run on it are."  He also said the problem is surmountable
if the latest release - Solaris 2.6, which has year 2000 support - is used.

But DISA plans to use Solaris 2.5 for GCCS Version 3.0 to be released in
January 1998.

Subject: Leaked memo on Mondex hacks embarasses bank

The following URL purports to contain an interesting leaked report on the
security of the Mondex model for electronic money, as analysed during the
due diligence process by a bank.

http://jya.com/mondex-hack.htm

The Risks:

1) Is an internal memorandum really covered by Copyright, since it is not
"published"?

2) Presumably, banks operate under an agreement with Mondex whereby they are
obliged to not disclose any security weaknesses they find in such security
products as Mondex.  Clearly, banks are not acting in the best interests of
their customers.  The risk is that keeping such holes secret doesn't improve
security.

3) Attempts to suppress information, such as threatening EFF Canada with
legal action, tend to have the opposite effect.

Subject: GM car acceleration due to EMI

You might want to take a look at the *Wall Street Journal*, 8 Sep 1997, page
B10, in which one incident (among many) of sudden acceleration by a GM car
was demonstrated (proven in court, after seven years) to come from
electromagnetic interference.  GM had 1,761 sudden acceleration incidents
between 1973 and 1986, with 1,121 injuries, and 31 deaths.  There is a
possibility that the Audi 5000 incidents (300 accidents, with 175 injuries
and 4 deaths between 1978 and 1986) had a similar origin.

In the GM court case, the "expert witness showed that the Buick's cruise
control was sensitive enough to be set off by simply running a power drill
near the car."

Subject: Re: FBI wants to ban the Bible ... (Rivest, RISKS-19.37)

This is reminiscent of a time a few decades ago when certain popular records
could be played backwards to reveal hidden messages. At that time there was
a movement seeking to make it illegal to record things backwards. Of course
any sound is just another sound backwards and I have seen cabaret acts by
entertainers who have trained themselves to speak backwards. Such
legislation would be nonsense for exactly the same reasons as the proposed
legislation against use of codes would be.

Any of us who have served time at the customer interface (I have spent many
happy hours giving technical support:) will also know that even apparently
plain English can turn out to be an impenetrable code (e.g. 'There was no
error message displayed' could mean 'the screen turned blue and there was so
much text displayed that it is easier to deny it ever existed rather than
try to remember what any of it said').

The risk here is in the failure to distinguish between imprecision,
inaccuracy and generalisation. The legislators seek to prevent people from
doing something they don't like but experience tells them that if they
define that thing too precisely there will be an immediate loophole in the
legislation because people will be able to achieve the same ends by an
activity which is slightly outside the definition. The solution is to
generalise by identifying what it is they are really trying to
prevent. Instead they arbitrarily lower the degree of precision in their
definition, resulting in inaccuracy rather than generalisation. The result
is all too often a meaningless definition rather than an accurate
generalisation.

I can think of an even more literal interpretation.  Namely, that any device

thus would be banned. I don't doubt that it is serious, but I am confused
over the literal interpretation of the words.  But in RISKS-19.36, John R.
Levine seemed to close a long standing debate over whether literal
interpretatation of law means that computers are fax machines and thus e-mail
must be faxes.

Which is it supposed to be?  Should citizens attempt to read and interpret
the literal text of written laws ourselves, or should we rely on lawyers to
tell us what the words really mean.

Perhaps we should we have a double standard.  Get excited over the exact

If what you read in RISKS, on Internet networks and their nonsecurity with

  Using encryption on the Internet is the equivalent of arranging a bike

Subject: Java Date Problems (Ryan, RISKS-19.37)

It may well be true that Java won't have a Y2K problem. But I've yet to find
a version of Java that has working Date classes. Try creating a new
GregorianCalendar() with no arguments and then setting it explicitly to Jan
27 1997 at 3:15pm (or any other time). If you inspect any of the other
fields in the GregorianCalendar (e.g., DAY_OF_YEAR, DAY_OF_WEEK,
DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH, AM_PM, HOUR, ZONE_OFFSET, or DST_OFFSET) you'll find
they haven't been set.

Or try creating a new GregorianCalendar object and calling
getFirstDayOfWeek().  It returns 1 but should be 0 in a US Locale.

You'll find other problems if you don't run in Pacific Standard Time. There
is a bug in java.text.SimpleDateFormat.initialize(). SimpleDateFormat in an
en_US locale initializes to PST (the first one listed in
java.text.resources.DateFormatZoneData_en) not TimeZone.getDefault() which
correctly (for me) returns EST (other fields correct for Daylight Savings
Time).

If you don't program Java, point your favorite Java enabled Web browser
(e.g., Netscape 4.01 on NT, recent versions of the IE Java VM seem to have
fixed this) at Intellicast's web site where they have a little Java clock
showing the local time and the GMT time, e.g.:

  http://www.intellicast.com/weather/bos/nexrad/

You'll find the local time to be PDT if you are in the US whether you're in
PDT or not.  And in older versions of Java you'd find that the GMT time is
off by an hour for DST.

The risk?  Don't assume that Y2K are the only date bugs you might have.

Bill Gunshannon describes treating numbers with a leading zero as octal as

is a C parser -- the C spec dictates this behavior.  But the orginal case
cited was a user input box on a web page.  And though there's no "spec" for
how a user interprets an input box, it's certainly the assumption of
virtually everyone that numbers are in base 10.

I've always thought it should have been 8 bytes on the VAX, myself.

I missed the original point above, but it's not really accurate (at least in
its snipped form).  C doesn't claim a long is 4 bytes.  The size of all the
types is basically machine dependent.  Yes, on most machines a long is 32
bits, but C doesn't decree that.

I worry more that we're not training people how to program.  While C may
leave a lot to be desired, it certainly doesn't prevent one from solving
these problems.  I can't think of any language that doesn't allow you to
write data to a disk in a binary format.  Any ability to do that could be
considered a problem since as machines progress the sizes and byte ordering
of such binary data may change.

Most people who care concerned about such issues solve them through proper
design and programming.  You can, for example, use typedefs in C to properly
map sensitive data types to the appropriate base types so they can be easily
changed when the software is ported.  When writing data to files, you can
use a canonical format such as text to avoid the problem mentioned above.
