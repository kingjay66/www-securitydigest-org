Subject: Re: Navy turns to off-the-shelf PCs to power ships (RISKS-19.75)

I can't remember the acronyms, but for many years now, US military
acquisition has been adjusting to using standard commercial products in
places where military spec was not warranted.  I'd like to believe that it's
due to commercial products being ISO9001 compliant and highly reliable, thus
meeting many needs.  (ex: ASUS motherboard monitor fan rotation, power
supply voltages and all).

But I agree that off the shelf parts just don't have the ACCOUNTABILITY and
MAINTAINABILITY that's required by military contracts, so I doubt any
integrator/contractor will risk using too many leading edge parts.  I'd like
to believe there are some checks-and-balances to the procurement system and
at some point, someone's head risks being on the chopping block, so
untrustworthy parts get blocked (lest they lose the contract and all future
business!).

As to software, I'm unsure off the shelf is allowed since it does not meet
security levels; needs to support all the proprietary military interfaces &
protocols and such.

On the bright side, SUN makes militarized systems (a friend noted Suns in
tanks)...

Subject: Navy turns to off-the-shelf PCs to power ships (Educom)

I work in the weapons safety area for the U.S. Navy.  One of my great fears
is having a weapon system come in running under Windows (any version).  So
far, I haven't seen that.  Not that there aren't systems running under
Windows, but (so far) not the systems directly pointing/firing weapons.  We
did have one system proposed to run under Windows (3.0 at the time, I think)
that would have popped up a dialog box at the Tactical Action Officer's
station saying "Fire Now!", but it never made it beyond engineering
development.  Actually, I figure the TAO would have looked down for advice
and found "Memory Error at Krnl.exe!" but that is another issue.

Software safety is one of our big concerns.  We know how to analyze gears,
springs and levers.  20 programs on 5 different kinds of processors under 10
different languages are a harder problem.  The one saving grace with Windows
is that we can ask the program manager how many times he has booted his
computer today.  Luckily, few of them have Macs.

Off the shelf PCs are going into service.  They are spinning up torpedos
and tracking ships and correlating radar tracks.  Acquisition reform can put
Packard Bell in control of lots of things.  But not yet Navy weapons.

This is less alarming than it sounds. The fact is that the fraction of all
semiconductors purchased by the US military has gone from over 50% to a
fraction of 1%, so the military can no longer expect its market clout to
cause vendors to design special hardware for it. This has resulted in a
migration from highly custom boards to ordinary industrial-strength
single-board computers with commodity CPUs, running commercial real-time
operating systems where appropriate.  Nope, no Windows95 controlling missile
launch.

You should be more alarmed at the prospect of all the military systems in
the field for which spare parts simply cannot be purchased -- how many years
until no 5 volt chips are produced? Will reliance on computerized control
result in the early demise of many weapons systems, at great cost (and risk)
to the taxpayer?

I just can't wait for the day when one of the class of '00 finds herself in
mid-Pacific with the blue-screen-o-death on the Wintel98 box that was
supposed to display the GPS output :-)

Later, someone quoted Henry Spencer that:

: Having a supposedly-reliable navigation aid that is lying to you is
: much worse than having to get by without it.

Which is related to why I miss the old VaxVMS debugger's habit of admitting
that it didn't really know what the current value of a variable was. The
"modern" spiffy IDE's I occasionally have to use will blandly lie through
their little cyber-teeth and claim preposterous results at equivalent
times. Of course, the only real threat to my life from such shenanigans has
to do with blood-pressure :-)

Subject: Medical effects of the Galaxy IV malfunction

I heard on NPR yet another manifestation of the Galaxy IV malfunction: the
inability of some pharmacies to verify insurance coverage during
prescription refill requests.  Elderly persons were told to pay cash or use
a credit card to cover the full retail price, not just a co-payment.  When
some people could not do so, some pharmacies apparently dispensed one or two
day supplies (probably suspending existing rules...quite in contrast to that
Chicago hospital emergency room....)

From: Mickey McInnis <mcinnis@austin.ibm.com>
Subject: Satellites and pagers

I think the recent satellite failure vs. paging failures merits further
study and, perhaps, even regulatory action.

Consider this scenario.

1) You buy paging service from a company with a local presence, i.e., they
have a local office, people working here, etc.

2) You call a local phone number to enter a page.

3) A local radio transmits the signal to your pager.

Those unfamiliar with the process would tend to assume that the process
of sending a page works locally, but in fact, it gets transmitted
through one or more satellite links and through facilities in multiple
ground stations.  (At least this is the way many paging systems work.)

Hospitals, doctors, and other emergency personnel (and those who depend on
them) are dependent on paging systems.  Many businesses are dependent on
paging systems.  Many of these customers could be well served if there was a
standalone "local" part of the system that works without communicating with
the home office.  Should these customers have been more informed of the
"weak" links in the paging system?

Should the paging companies have provided an autonomous local system or a
local backup network?  I would say it's obvious that such a system could be
provided, and even a ground-based backup for the satellite link could be
provided, but it's a matter of cost.  i.e. the system could be more robust,
but it will cost money.

I think that the road ahead is paved with lawyers for the paging companies.

If your business or some service you need depends on pagers, you had better
consider what kind of backups you have.  You might also want to have a talk
with your paging company to see what kind of backups and failure points they
have.  Perhaps if enough customers press them on the issue, they'll work on
their backups.  Of course, if you asked them last week about backup systems,
they would have probably assured you that they have redundancy and backup
systems.

Actually this points out another problem.  How do you really find out how
good the contingency plans are for that service you buy from a multi-billion
dollar multinational company?  How do you know that the new CFO for the
company won't farm out some vital component of the system to some location
in a foreign company halfway around the world with shaky telecommunications
links, potential political unrest, or some area affected by natural
disasters?

Perhaps the only safe bet is to have a penalty clause for outages that is so
severe that you make more money if the system is down than if it's up.

You should also consider your side of the paging (or other
telecommunications) system.  Did you consolidate something in some remote
location to save money?  What happens with the phone lines or that site
breaks down?

However, as one comedian pointed out last night on cable, perhaps there is a
bright side and drug dealing has decreased the past day or two.

Subject: GPS correction (Re: RISKS-19.75)

Actually, I believe that the satellite is owned by some division of General
Electric, but is *operated* by PanAmSat.  (My pager, BTW, was one of those
affected.)

Obvious Risk: I wonder if the embedded systems on the communications
satellites that we all depend on now are Y2K-compliant?

From: Paul Wallich <pw@panix.com>
Subject: GPS jamming/spoofing

I think some of the confusion I've seen in recent comments about GPS jamming
comes from a failure to distinguish pure jamming (making GPS unavailable)
from GPS spoofing (transmitting signals that cause a GPS receiver to report
an erroneous position). Spoofing, as far as I understand it, is in principle
a malicious form of differential GPS (in which a ground-based transmitter of
fixed, very-well-known position emits signals based on the difference
between its known position and its GPS-derived position.  I've seen such
transmitters referred to as "pseudolites" because they apparently appear to
GPS receivers as members of the GPS satellite constellation.) Someone who
knows this stuff cold might give a much better explanation.

In the meantime, the US Naval Academy has announced that middies will no
longer have to learn to navigate by sextant, evidencing a touching faith in
the invulnerability of GPS transmitters and receivers under combat and
disaster conditions...

Subject: Failure modes when the power fails

On Tuesday, May 19, at approximately 11:50 pm, the UC Berkeley campus lost
power for a few hours.  Apparently what happened is that there were some bad
insulators in the main campus substation which needed to be replaced
urgently.  The campus attempted to switch over to the backup power source (a
generator facility which can provide roughly 80% of the power) but that
failed, causing a blackout until the generator could be repaired.

In the CS department we also learned something of how things fail.  Being a
rather large department, cardkeys are used to control access to many floors
and rooms.  Some cardkey locks have their own power supply, others don't.
Those with power are unable to reach the controlling computer, and default
to "unlock with any cardkey", while those without power default to locked.
It is interesting that the machine rooms, wiring closets, etc, all had power
and therefore were all unlocked, while many of the stairway doors (to get to
the upper floors) were locked.  This suggests that we need to put the
controlling computer on a UPS and check the backup power supplies for all
locks.

Another interesting failure damaged our file servers.  Our two big Auspex
servers have short term (<30 minute) UPS power supplies, which actually
worked this time.  (Previously, we have had the UPSs fail).  However, there
were not enough plugs in the UPSs, and the consoles for the machines were
not plugged in to the UPS power supplies.  The admins failed to find a
9<->25 pin serial adapter in time to hook up a notebook before the UPSs ran
out of power.  Fortunately we have very good system administrators, and with
the exception of a blown power supply which powers some of the disks,
service was restored by the next day.

Subject: Computer-based election problems?

(written May 11, but our news server refused moderated groups until today...)

The general election in Germany is not until September, but a fight is going
on in Berlin about the new election software. It was purchased from a town
in the west of Germany, Hamm. The software was developed by programmers at
city hall. It seems that the software is cool and runs under Windows 95 (did
I hear someone shuddering out there?), but that there are problems
interfacing to the "ancient" 16-bit software currently in use in Berlin for
tallying the results from the boroughs. The "Tagespiegel" ran a large
headline about the possibility of no election data in Berlin because of the
16-bit/32-bit incompatibility. A few days later we had the angry replies
from Hamm, if Berlin would just get their act together and upgrade their
Windows 3.1 machines everything would be just fine. The ward leaders have
now replied that the software is probably okay, they just have a lot of
training to do.

I see more than Windows problems here, Hamm has 190,000 inhabitants, Berlin
has about 3.4 million. Could be a slight scale-up problem here, stay
tuned...

Subject: Re: Encrypting e-mail -- or not?

From the article by Michael Stutz, "Security Bugaboo in MS Outlook?"
in Wired News, posted by James Glave:

  The bug arises when a user creates an encrypted message and then tries
  to cancel it -- the message is not cancelled, but is sent, sans
  encryption.

Isn't there another risk here, namely, that a message thought to be
canceled was not?  The consequences of that could be as bad as third
party interception.  For example, suppose an employee is angry at their
boss and composes an inflammatory message with a notice of resignation.
Then, after blowing off some steam, decides to cancel the message.

Subject: ZDNet Grief

Like Ken McGlothlen (see RISKS 19.74), I also received an "Announcing ZDNet
Mail" notice. It told me an account was already setup for me, and that all I
needed to do was visit their WEB site and enter my old ZDNet username and
password, which ZDNet unfortunately included (problem #1) as plain text in
their notice directly to me.

Problem #2 is that prior to this notice, I tried to unsubscribe from ZDNet,
but even though I only recall *one* point-of-subscription, I've had to visit
2 separate points-of-unsubscription (ZDNet "Software Express" and ZDNet
"ANCHORDESK") and am nowing trying to deal with a 3rd
point-of-unsubscription (ZDNet "Update").  In all fairness to ZDNet, they're
not the only ones with *one* point-of-subscription that results in
(unbeknownst to the subscriber) *multiple* points-of-unsubscription.

Problem #3 (stupid me) is that while preparing this report, I visited the
ZDNet Mail Web site, went out of my way NOT to enter the "Member" zone using
my old username and password, and instead entered the "non-Member" zone to
see want type of information they would want from me.  Arrggg, the
non-Member page still recognized me and instantly announced "xxxxx, thank
you for joining ZDNet .... Access your new ZDNet Mail account ...."  Zero
warning going in, and no final OK/Cancel option.

Problem #4, there is no apparent information on how to unsubscribe from
problem #3.

Problem #5, unlike e-mail based subs/unsubs, I have few transaction records
from all of the unfortunate web-based subs/unsubs and encounters.

ZDNet is like quick-sand - every move I make to get out, I sink farther in.
