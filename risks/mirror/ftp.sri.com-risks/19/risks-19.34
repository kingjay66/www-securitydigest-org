Subject: AOL users hit by e-mail scam and Trojan horse URL

Subscribers of America Online recently received e-mail apparently from AOL's
chief of Member Services, entitled ``Important AOL Information'' and giving
an update on AOL's efforts to improve its service.  At the end was a URL to
a letter from AOL Chairman Steve Case, in which readers were asked to give
their name, address, home phone, and credit-card number to update AOL's new
computers.  Surprisingly to most victims (AOL's subscribers include many
online novices, more of whom should be reading RISKS!), the file being
updated was that of a scammer who simply raked in the information.  (It was
not specified whether his/her identity had been determined.)  [Source: An

Subject: Network Solutions goof bumps NASDAQ off the Internet 

  [PGN Abstracting, from article by Will Rodger,
  from Inter@ctive Week Online, 21 Aug 1997, 9:14am PDT, 
  http://www5.zdnet.com/zdnn/content/inwo/0821/inwo0002.html]

The NASDAQ stock exchange was knocked off much of the Internet for several
hours on 19 Aug 1997 as a result of administrative errors at the InterNIC, a
centralized Internet address clearinghouse run by Network Solutions Inc. of
Herndon, Va., NASDAQ officials said Wednesday.  Though the problem was
initially invisible to NASDAQ, which maintains its own database of Internet
addresses, the temporary suspension of access to the exchange's site blocked
users of major computer networks -- including those owned by IBM Corp., MCI
Communications Corp., PSINet Inc. and UUnet Technologies Inc. -- from
getting to the site.  As a result, NASDAQ was unreachable to most Internet
users for at least several hours Tuesday morning.  Problems with the Web
site had no effect on the functioning of NASDAQ itself.  The snafu was due
to a clerical error at NSI, which evidently lost track of NASDAQ's $50 fee,
submitted in October 1996.  

Will remarked that things like this seem to be occurring more often.  The
weekend before, more than 5,000 Web sites were blocked for over 24 hours,
when Web Communication Inc and other domains were bumped from the Internet
after a screwup in routine InterNIC maintenance.  Will also mentioned the
disappearance of .com and .net, noted earlier in RISKS (Pouzzner, RISKS-19.25).

"Officials blamed a malfunctioning computer for five water main breaks late

A little-noticed clause in the recently proposed $368-billion deal struck
between the nation's largest tobacco sellers and states' attorneys general
states, "The new regime would ... prohibit tobacco product advertising on
the Internet unless designed to be inaccessible in or from the United
States."  Critics note that if the settlement becomes law, that clause could
set a disturbing precedent for restricting all forms of online speech, and
could encourage other countries to emulate these restrictions or make them
even tougher.  Any company with a global commercial presence, says a law
professor at University of California at Los Angeles, would be forced to
limit its online presence to whatever is allowed by the most restrictive
country it does business in.  (*Investor's Business Daily*, 22 Aug 1997;

Subject: Amazon.com countersues Barnes & Noble (Edupage)

In the latest assault in the escalating battle between pioneer online
bookseller Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble, Amazon.com has filed a countersuit
against Barnes & Noble, alleging that the bricks & mortar entity should be
charging sales tax on the books it sells over the Internet.  Amazon 's
argument is based on the fact that B&N, unlike Amazon.com, has a physical
presence in most states through its chain of 1,000-plus stores that
therefore constitute the "nexus" of activity in each state.  An attorney for
B&N says there is "no basis whatever" for Amazon's claim.  In May, Barnes &
Noble filed suit against Amazon.com, saying its claim to be "the world's
largest bookstore" was false advertising.  (Wall Street Journal 22 Aug 97;

Subject: Florida to Automate Traffic Citations 

An article on Clarinet (22 Aug 1997) tells us that Florida has let a $6.2
million contract to Unisys to automate the issuance of traffic citations.
Troopers will "be armed with pen-based laptop computers and printers.  The
laptops...will 'recognize' the troopers' hand printing and automatically
convert it to easily readable text."

Anybody care to predict the number of traffic tickets thrown out of court
over the next several years because they were issued to the wrong people?

The one saving grace is that the motorist gets a printout with a copy of the
ticket.  But I can just see the poor innocent party who has to prove that he
was in Bangladesh on the day that somebody with a similar license number ran
a red light.

800MHz RF signal (saying the phones are analog), not to mention several
computers?  I have several computers, radios, etc. here on the ground
(producing a lot of RF, spurious and non) and I have no problems with 3
watts of 800MHz RF.  If that little RF can wipe a aircraft computer, what
could it do to major office buildings, etc. where cell phones are used in
MUCH closer proximity to computers (and sometimes much more sensitive ones).

    Top 10 Reasons Why Data is Analyzed Before it is Collected

    10. We practice Zen and the Art of Ground Water Sampling.
    9. We can impress auditors that way.
    8. We can tell whether collecting the sample will be worth our time.
    7. We get results much sooner this way.
    6. It saves money.
    5. It lets us know what type of sample we need to take.
    4. We can notify the well owner that we have a hunch their well should be

    3. Our lab has an incredible turn around time.
    2. The lab transmits data faster than light speed, so it arrives before it

Subject: Netscape Communicator 4.02 and 4.01a allow disclosure of passwords

Using the latest Netscape Communicator we are able to get your credit card
number, password for online banking or online brokerage order, etc, only
restricted by the imagination of the malicious server implementer. This is
due to a flaw in Javascript identified by the Reliable Software Group at
University of California Santa Barbara. It enables a malicious site to track
all activities of a user in the Internet. Besides being able to get this
information, which violates the user's privacy, by using an ingenious
technique we are able to target chosen pages and use a fake server to
convince the user to type in privileged information. We submitted a security
bug report to Netscape, but we believe that this is a very serious threat,
which is easy to implement. As such it should be widely disseminated. This
flaw was tested in Netscape Communicator 4.01a, the latest version of
Netscape, and it is described, together with other attacks in our paper at
http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~andre/attack.ps.

Netscape has released a new version of Communicator for Windows 95/NT. It is
Netscape Communicator 4.02. In this version our attack is much more
threatening. This is because on the previous version the access on the
location object was better implemented and in order to get a string value to
this object we had to close a second browser we opened. Using the new
version of Netscape we are able, using an infinite loop, to access the
string that represents the location object, against the security policy of
Javascript.  Therefore, using this version, we don't even need to close the
second browser. We are still investigating which other security policies are
badly implemented in this new version of Netscape Communicator.

After the recent security breach of the "Crack-A-Mac" server (which has now

interesting e-mail exchange comparing the relative security of Macintosh
against Unix systems.

To quote one respondent:
  "Because the Mac was not made to be a networked computer, it is
  infinitely more secure than a UNIX box. If you are running plain
  vanilla Webstar on a Mac, you are safe. Period. If you are running
  plain vanilla Apache (or other UNIX webserver) on a UNIX box, you
  are toast if there is a determined hacker. Only the most dedicated
  SysAdmins can keep up with all the CERT advisories and patches...
  and even if you do, there will be holes. Whether it be a NIS hole,
  a finger hole, a telnet bug, or what have you, there will always
  be one more hole than fix on a UNIX box."

Subject: Direct action to "sting" the junk e-mailers -- RISKy? 

I recently saw a new anti-junk-e-mail tactic which, at first glance, struck
me as a great idea.  The concept is to "sting" the producers of bulk e-mail
mailing lists by including something like the following in your .sig:

  And for you automated e-mail junk-mailers out there, here is
  a list of the current board of the Federal Communications Commission:
	
    Chairman Reed Hundt:         rhundt@fcc.gov
    Commissioner James Quello:  jquello@fcc.gov
    Commissioner Susan Ness:      sness@fcc.gov
    Commissioner Rachelle Chong: rchong@fcc.gov
	
  And let's help you send some junk mail to the USPS, too:

    customer@email.usps.gov

This is based on the assumption that the junk list compilers sift entire
Usenet News articles (not just the "From:" lines) for any syntactically
valid e-mail addresses.  The e-mail addresses listed above will thus be
included on the compiled lists; then these worthy individuals will receive
any junk mail sent by anyone using said lists.

Since these people have influence on public policy, it is hoped that the
annoyance of actually receiving as much junk mail as the rest of us do will
push them in the direction of strong sanctions against such junk mail.

Where I work, we have been having a discussion in-house about whether or not
doing this is advisable.  The strongest objection that I have seen is that
by including such addresses in one's e-mail, one is actually contributing to
junk mail, and thus acting contrary to the same anti-junk-mail principle
that one is trying to promote.  Also, if one does it from one's company
account, one may be acting against the corporate policy for internet use;
and finally, there is the issue of contributing to a violation of the right
to privacy (here meaning the right not to be harassed) of the public
individuals cited.

I find these contra arguments not completely persuasive, but I am still
undecided.

The final RISK that I can see is that we may actually influence the
policy-makers to take some action, but that action may turn out different
from our expectation and preference.

Does the proposed Goodlatte legislation say that the copying has to be

those felons at Microsoft and Sun and IBM and HP away for years for the all
that software that they copy and sell.

About the only people who wouldn't be felons here would be GNU since
their software is free and they can copy it as many times as they want

lock them up!

Subject: Re: Risks, Reliability, Regulation, Infrastructures (Ware, R-19.33)

Methinks the Beltway Bandit doth protest too much!  For some reason,
bureaucrats and their Beltway Bandit lackeys always assume that more
regulation is better than less regulation.  In this case, Willis is arguing
that "the system ain't broke, so don't fix it".

I would argue that the system _is_ broken, and it is badly broken.  Here in
California we pay twice as much for our electricity as people in other
states, and many of these costs were _caused_ by the politicians and the
bureaucrats themselves in the first place.  We're not happy about paying for
these hair-brained ideas like nuclear power plants and
doctor/dentist-taxshelter windmills.

I, and nearly everyone I know, could afford to purchase a backup generator
_every year_ for what we pay in excess electricity costs.

The Internet works precisely because it dispenses with link-by-link
guarantees, and uses end-to-end protocols.  Its openness encourages
innovation -- something that the electrical utilities have discouraged for
the past 80-100 years.  Perhaps the myth of 'economies of scale' that the
utilities have wrapped themselves in for the past 100 years is just that --
simply a myth.  Or if the economies of scale exist, but never make it to the
customer, then they doesn't matter.  The best place to put redundancy is at
the customer level, where each customer can optimize for his own goals and
costs.

Subject: Re: SET Risks (Sterling, RISKS-19.33)

Unfortunately, this response demonstrates the problems with the SET process:

1.  It is highly dependent on an Electronic Wallet, which is never discussed
in the SET process.

2.  It is highly dependent on who the user of the wallet is, which is never
discussed in the SET process, nor is how to identify the user discussed.

3.  The very practical issue of carrying the user's certificate between PCs
is never discussed in the SET process. SET ignoring this issue and its
security demands doesn't make the issue go away!  Not addressing mobility
ignores the issue that insiders will use those techniques to overcome SET
protection.

4.  The issue of insiders usurping complete certificate messages is never
discussed in the SET process.  This must be a very serious issue since the
card associations have already published a disclaimer.  See the V/MC press
release of 8/6/97.  It establishes the SET Mark (a trade mark like symbol)
for SET acceptable web pages.  The release clearly states the purpose to be
"...to use their cards on marked web sites WITHOUT ANY WORRY OF THEIR CARD
DETAILS BEING INTERCEPTED." (my capitalization). Are they so naive as to
think there will not be counterfeit SET marks on unauthorized web pages?
Any security solution that depends on the user or employee actions is known
to be ineffective.

5.  The history lesson that software exposures exist in the current card
system anyway, misses the point.  SET is supposed to be the NEW invincible
solution and doesn't fix this known exposure.

6. The attempt to disassociate the SET process from the vendor
implementation flies in face of a card association PR campaigne to enumerate
the outside vendor role in making SET happen.  It flies in the face of
intense vendor promotion of the SET process as their basis for selling the
new invincible SET solutions - which we are now told has the some of the
same shortcomings as the current software solutions.

7.  The response that consumers will not have much choice is wrong.  The
Mondex system completely by passes the SET complex 26 step process with a
demonstrated card-to-card security solution usable through open systems.
Mondex USA has announced significant roll out this and next year.  The
concepts are being tested by Citibank (with the Verifone Personal ATM, phone
connected device), and Chase (with Mondex units) in the early 1998 major
field test in New York early next year.  All the banks and credit unions of
Canada have announced Mondex use.  Also, several USA financial institutions
have announced that Mondex smart cards will carry both USA and Canadian
dollars, and will carry cash, debit and credit funds.  I would be a little
worried at the card associations.  The associations can not continue to
stone wall smart card credit cards in the United States.  In fact, smart
cards (NOT addressed in the SET process) would go a long way to overcome the
SET deficiencies I have discussed in this note.  Or, maybe this message from
Mr Sterling is notice that MasterCard (51% owner of Mondex International) is
about to suppress Mondex use in the USA.

In summary, the credit-card associations and their SET process can't have it
both ways.  To offer the invincible Internet solution - but keep the old
problems.  To offer the SET process but ignore the shortcomings of the
vendor implementations.  To offer an open system, Internet, solution and
then to ignore smart card benefits and the practical issue of SET process
mobility between the five PCs in my life.  (home, office, laptop, hotel and
the company I am visiting.)
