Subject: 45,000 GSM phones recalled for software upgrade

Recent newspaper ads recalled Ericsson GF-788 GSM phones for a software
upgrade to remediate a software bug.  This particular Ericsson GSM model was
losing base-station signals and shutting itself off in "emergency call"
mode, while other brands work fine.  It should be switched off and on again
to operate.  Consumers' complaints about the GF-788 eventually led the
company to run the ads.

Well over 45,000 units have been sold in Turkey.  Some European countries
(like Austria and Greece) have banned import of that model GSM until the
software is fixed.  (Turkey has over 700,000 GSM customers.)  [Source: The
Turkish daily newspaper, *Hurriyet*]

The California DMV has fired 24 more clerks who accepted bribes to issue

statewide probe, Operation Clean Sweep.  The going rate was $200 to $1000 a
pop for not checking the applicant's identity, typically paid by illegal
aliens, felons needing new identities, and drivers with revoked licenses.

Richard Foster, jailed for driving with a suspended licence, was set free

Augusta-Richmond County Sheriff's Office had no interest in Foster.
(Actually, at that time he was wanted on assault and weapons charges.)  The
fax had been sent from a public fax machine at a Kroger grocery store in
Augusta GA, and had the Kroger name and phone number on the fax.  As a
result of this spoof, the jail supervisor has been demoted from captain to
sergeant.  [Source: *San Francisco Chronicle*, 23 Jul 1997, A2]

Subject: Offshore Internet gambling taking *off*

There are now at least three dozen Internet gambling houses, the latest of
which -- Bet the Net -- begins operating as an Internet casino from Dominica
in the Caribbean in about two weeks.  The expected revenues from all such
Internet operations is estimated at $8 billion by the year 2000, where the
current total take for U.S. casinos is currently $23 billion.  [Source:
Bloomberg News, *San Francisco Chronicle*, 1 Aug 1997, B2.]

The risks include bogus virtual casinos whose payoffs turn out to be more
virtual than real, semi-legitimate casinos working credit-card scams on the
side, glorious opportunities for money laundering, serious gambling debts
accumulated in your name by a masquerader, spawning of serious undetected
addictive behavior that might otherwise be observed (on the Internet no one
knows you are a gambler, except for the casino), your 9-year-old gambling
with your credit card -- especially if your browser automagically inserts
your credit information -- and so on into the night.  As a second-order
effect, massive illegal activities could also lead to attempted restrictions
on the good system security and cryptography necessary to conduct legitimate
Internet commerce.  In any event, whether or not you bet on the Net, don't
bet on the Net being adequately secure!  You are already gambling with the
weaknesses in our computer-communication infrastructures, but NetBet could
raise the ante considerably.  Caveat aleator.

Subject: Risks of ordering airline tickets online

Last Thursday night, 24 Jul 1997, a friend of mine on the east coast of the
US tried using the web server of the Internet Travel Network (www.itn.net)
to book a trip. [For convenience, I'll give all dates/times in US EST.]
The web server, on submission of the information (including billing
address, credit card information, etc), replied with this:

  Data transfer complete          Internet Travel Network - Server Error
  Could You Give Us A Hand?
  _________________________________________________________________________
  One of our server's programs has just experienced an unrecoverable error. 
  This is neither normal, nor desirable. We are extremely interested in any
  occurrence of this! Could you please send a note to bugs@itn.net and relay
  the precise conditions that may have sparked this incident? This is a
  special, high-priority mailbox that we will check right away."

The details were e-mailed to bugs@itn.net that was redirected to an
individual's e-mail account. That person was not only not providing
high-priority service to such e-mail, she had an automatic responder in
place which e-mailed back to say she was on vacation, and to try sending
anything important to support@itn.net.

So, e-mail was sent to that account, as well as to the response form on the
web site. On Friday morning, more e-mail was sent, but by Friday midday, ITN
had not responded to any of the e-mail messages that had been sent to them.
One e-mail to them asked when their hours were and when they were likely to
get around to responding one way or another, and this was finally answered
on Friday afternoon, along with a California phone number.

The customer had no idea whether a booking had been made by the web site,
despite the error message from the server. She had no idea whether the
booking had been made by whoever had finally received the bug report e-mail.
She could have booked through someone else and ended up with 2 sets of
non-refundable tickets. She could have left things as they were, and been
forced to pay much more. She was going away for the weekend, so left it.

ITN, when phoned on Monday, claimed that no booking had been made, and had
little excuse for the 6-8 pieces of e-mail they had not responded to.  They
said all they could do was book on another airline, on flights which were
far less convenient.

Imagine our surprise when the originally booked tickets turned up on
Tuesday, 29 Jul, postmarked the previous Saturday. ITN support again tried
to access the booking and again couldn't immediately find it, despite the
tickets having arrived! It appears the booking had been processed by the web
server in the first place, despite the error message!

The risks are almost too many to count here. The risk of getting an error
message when buying something, so submitting it again N times, and actually
getting N+1 tickets. The risk of assuming that an error message means that
an order failed, and going and booking somewhere else, not realising that
the order really did go through. The risk of not knowing what is happening
when the people in such organisations don't bother to answer e-mail in a
timely manner. The risk that an error, if it really does mean that the order
wasn't processed, will result in enormous extra costs once this is
confirmed. In this instance, it was necessary to phone long-distance to get
any sort of meaningful response from the company. (It is possible to contact
them toll-free, as I later found out, but this is not mentioned on their web
site, and was explicitly denied in e-mail!) However, a seat on the same
flights that were booked 5 days ago for US$164 would have cost US$563 to
book today! The person who waited until contacted by the company could find
themselves severely disadvantaged.

There are, of course, plenty of security issues as well, particularly when
sending billing details to an e-mail address, which duplicate details sent
to a web server, and when that e-mail address is being redirected to a
person's account who is currently away from the office.

Subject: What to do about software patents

Seeing the vast numbers of non-novel and obvious software patents issuing in
my area (financial services), a number of unorthodox ideas are crossing my
mind, such as ...

We all know that when a governmental body, such as a city welfare agency,
state prison system, state housing agency, or the like is found to be way
out of line as far as administering and enforcing the laws, one of the more
drastic remedies is to place the deficient agency or department into a court
or legislatively ordered receivership.

Are we reaching the point where we should ask a judge to place the Patent
Office, or the software art areas, under a court-appointed receiver or
administrator, due to its manifest ongoing failure to carry out its official
duties under Federal Law with respect to 35 U.S.C. 101, 102, 103, Rule 56
and so on?

I am starting to think so, but it would be a major political undertaking, to
put it mildly, so I figured I would start this inquiry.  Yes, it would be a
lot of work to document the problem and prepare for court and/or legislative
hearings, etc.

While much of the issue here is technical, dealing in part with inaccurate
data, perhaps a more major risk is social.  The Attorney General's office
has been under substantial pressure from Government, caused in part by
substantial public pressure to "do something".  I have the pleasure of
working with some of the tech. folks in that arena, and they are well aware
of data inaccuracies, but have been directed to publish. Period.  The risk
of have politicians mandate poor quality technical activity is obvious as is
the risk of hysteria in a punitive public.  I just want to point out that
the folks in the trenches are not the culprits in this case.

Roger Barnett pointed out that with some new MS products -- the compiler

There is a simple solution to ensuring that the web browser never access the
net with any "potentially" unsafe features enabled: set it up to point to a
nonexistent or "null" proxy server, so that all non-local web sites are
inaccessible. This technique works pretty well -at least until all
applications expect full web access for dynamic loading of remote code
components and help files.

The implementation of a web proxy that returns "Server Unavailable" to all
requests is left as an exercise for the reader.

The Mersenne code runs some (reputedly) real mean FPU tests as it

Subject: Re: General Mills, AOL, Chex Quest (Baker, RISKS-19.26)

The message from Bruce N. Baker <baker@hooked.net> in RISKS-19.26 is just
another example of what happens when children are allowed free access to
complicated machines like computers without adult supervision.  Had his
grandson not had implicit permission to use the computer, Bruce would have
been able to review the documentation and note that the Chex Quest game
(which is present on the CD-ROM), requires DOS/Windows, while both the
Windows and Mac versions of AOL software are included.  I would imagine that
including AOL on the discs cut duplication costs for Ralston Foods, probably
to zero.

I had no problem installing the game on a Windows 95 machine without
installing AOL software.  The game itself is definitely not related to AOL
in any way.

What I find far more interesting about Chex Quest is that it is in fact a
modified version of Doom (or possibly Quake), yet has an RSAC rating of
"ALL" (suitable for all audiences).  How did they get the rating? By
changing occurrences of "shoot" to "zorch" and "kill" to "return to their
own dimension", and using different graphics.  This leads to odd sounding
constructions like "Many of the Flemoids will need to be zorched a couple of
times before they will return to their own dimension".

The RISK is that violent actions are suddenly non-violent, mainly because
certain terminology has changed.  Is a child used to "slagging demons to
death" really more likely to become violent than one who is used to
"zorching Flemoids until they return to their own dimension"?  It is still
up to the parents to explain the difference between the game and reality.

Something tells me that this legal language would not be enforceable.  I Am

be bound by something like that just through the act of buying that product.
After all, if that were the case, why couldn't I put something on my product
that says, in fine print, "By buying this I agree to give Doug Linder all my
money."

This seems to me to be very similar to the "shrink-wrap" licenses on
software which have, in most cases, been found to be unenforceable.  I
believe companies just persist on putting such language on packaging because
they figure it will probably scare people, or at least convince the less

money, put it in a envelope, and send it in. (May be legend, suspect true

Actually is a much more sweeping question - is a preprinted notice ("by

boxes?

Just a few years ago there was no concern about children and on-line

Is this really connected to the 809 (and certain other area codes) scams,
where the perpetrator relies on ignorance.  At what point is the "common

Subject: Re: Y2K: a different solution (Driss, RISKS-19.26)

Driss (driss@golden.net) mentions a number of concepts as a possible
solution to the Y2K problem in RISKS-19.26 that hold, I think, more severe
risks than the original problem!

I'll summarize briefly, so as not to have to quote too heavily.  I'm sure
Driss will be happy to correct me if I'm missing something here. :)

1)  Take all active records with dates from 1900 to 1910 and put them
    in a separate database.  Archive all inactive ones elsewhere.
2)  Subtract 10 years from the dates in the remaining data.
3)  Add a new program layer to handle the conversion between "real" dates
    and the stored dates, leaving the current i/o interface intact.

There are a number of problems with these assumptions that I see right off
the bat.  First is that most running databases have several date fields;
which ones do you choose to archive off to the "other" set of tables (that
you must still handle)?  Far more serious, however, is the second.  Need I
even point out the inherent Risk in mucking up your data this way?  The
entire *point* of data processing is to deal with large amounts of data as
quickly and **accurately** as possible, and an enormous amount of
programming and checking goes into making sure that that this gets done,
with data validation, dependencies, etc.  In the corporate world, here's
every chance that more than one person will get the task of doing this
setting your data back 20 or more years.  Or the computer will crash halfway
through the operation, leaving you with some unknown chunk of your data with
some fields munged.  Or that some of the fields will be skipped in the
general chaos; it isn't as simple as telling your DBM to type "SUBTRACT 10
YEARS FROM ALL DATES"

Adding another set of programs between your data i/o and your front end
interface adds additional failure points and validation problems, adds time
to the processing (a millisecond here and there may not sound like much,
but add it up over several millions of data records accessing
constantly...), and increases your systems' complexity.  Plus, there's
often no easy way to accomplish this feat; many programs put requests to
the database server; these programs would have to be modified to run to a
different server program (I shudder to think at the concept of replacing
the database server itself; that would then affect any non-date-dependent
programs running!)

In short, too many risks for too little benefit.  Mangling your data doesn't
SOLVE the problem; it only sets it off 10 more years.  (Everyone who
believes corporations will continue tackling Y2K if there's another decade
on the the deadline instead of putting it off AGAIN, raise your hand.
Anyone?  Anyone?)  And it's not entirely clear to me that this would, in
fact be any easier or faster than using field expansion and/or date
windowing as appropriate.

Only 886 more days to go...

Unlike "NetLaw" (cf. BKNETLAW.RVW), which was written for sysops and users,
"CyberLaw" is written for lawyers.  It is liberally supplied with footnote
references to case studies and decisions dealing with the topics discussed.
(Because of this, "CyberLaw", more than any other computer law book I have
reviewed, is pertinent *only* to the United States.)
 
Unlike "Net Law" (cf. BKNLHLUI.RVW), which looks at legal practice,
"CyberLaw" deals strictly with points of law.  Topics covered include
copyright, trademark, defamation, privacy, duty of care, criminal liability,
procedural issues, electronic contracts, misappropriation of information,
civil rights, tax, and evidence.  (One chapter which does *not* deal with
the law is entitled "Ethics".)  As noted, there are extensive footnote
references to case law, as well as reprints of relevant issues of the
author's "CyberLaw" column.
 
For those outside the legal profession, the book is reasonably clear on the
major issues.  Its real value, however, would be to lawyers looking for a
