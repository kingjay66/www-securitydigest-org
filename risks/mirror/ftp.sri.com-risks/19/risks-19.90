Subject: Software flaw exposes e-mail programs ...

A security flaw found in several of the most widely used e-mail programs
(Microsoft Outlook Express, Microsoft Outlook 98, and Netscape Mail) could
be used by malicious persons to send computers using those programs a virus
that could destroy or steal data and could cause those computers to crash.
The flaw, which is known as a buffer overflow error, occurs when a program
fails to check the length of each character string.  This failure means that
a string too large to fit into an allotted memory location will lock up the
program and fool the operating system into running attacker code in its
place.  Whereas new languages such as Java have built-in safeguards to
prevent this kind of programmer error, older languages such as C and C++ do
not.  Computer security specialist Steven Bellovin says, "C makes it too
easy to slice your fingers off, and programmers all over the world are doing
so with great regularity."  (*The New York Times*, 30 Jul 1998; Edupage, 30
July 1998.  This is the Finnish find.)

Subject: Long-filename security bug in e-mail readers and safe languages

There's been a lot of coverage of the potential security hole in Microsoft
and Netscape's mail readers.  Most reports note that this is the same kind
of bug exploited by Robert Morris's Internet worm: overflow a fixed-length
buffer on the stack to predictably sabotage the control flow of the program.

What all the reports I've read appear to be missing is that bugs like this
are almost inevitable in C or C++, yet pose almost no security issues in
safer programming languages, including as Java, Lisp, Ada, Smalltalk,
Modula-3, Eiffel, ML, etc.

That is, the consequence of overflowing an array in Java is that an
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown.  No stack gets overwritten, no
data gets corrupted.  The program fails, but it does so in a sensible,
predictable manner.  Contrast this with C or C++, where the existence of a
single, unchecked array access based on user-provided input is sufficient to
expose gaping security holes.

Just as the use of four digits for dates was considered wasteful or
unnecessary in the past, the use of safe languages is often thought a luxury
today.  It isn't.

Subject: ISSalert: ISS Security Advisory: cDc BackOrifice Backdoor

ISS Security Alert Advisory
August 6th, 1998

Cult of the Dead Cow Back Orifice Backdoor

Synopsis:

A hacker group known as the Cult of the Dead Cow has released a Windows
95/98 backdoor named 'Back Orifice' (BO).  Once installed this backdoor
allows unauthorized users to execute privileged operations on the affected
machine.

Back Orifice leaves evidence of its existence and can be detected and
removed.  The communications protocol and encryption used by this backdoor
has been broken by ISS X-Force.

Description:
A backdoor is a program that is designed to hide itself inside a target 
host in order to allow the installing user access to the system at a later 
time without using normal authorization or vulnerability exploitation.

Functionality:
The BO program is a backdoor designed for Windows 95/98. Once installed it 
allows anyone who knows the listening port number and BO password to 
remotely control the host.  Intruders access the BO server using either a 
text or graphics based client.  The server allows intruders to execute 
commands, list files, start silent services, share directories, upload and 
download files, manipulate the registry, kill processes, list processes, as 
well as other options.

Encrypted Communications:
All communications between backdoor client and the server use the User 
Datagram Protocol (UDP).  All data sent between the client and server is 
encrypted, however it is trivial to decrypt the data sent. X-Force has been 
able to decrypt BO client requests without knowing the password and use the 
gathered data to generate a password that will work on the BO server.

The way that BO encrypts its packets is to generate a 2 byte hash from the 
password, and use the hash as the encryption key. The first 8 bytes of all 
client request packets use the same string: "*!*QWTY?", thus it is very 
easy to brute force the entire 64k key space of the password hash and 
compare the result to the expected string. Once you know the correct hash 
value that will decrypt packets, it is possible to start generating and 
hashing random passwords to find a password that will work on the BO 
server. In our tests in the X-Force lab, this entire process takes only a 
few seconds, at most, on a Pentium-133 machine. With our tools we have been 
able to capture a BO request packet, find a password that will work on the 
BO server, and get the BO server to send a dialog message to warn the 
administrator and kill its own process. 

Determining if BO has been installed on your machine:
The BO server will do several things as it installs itself on a target 
host:

* Install a copy of the BO server in the system directory 
(c:\windows\system) either as " .exe" or a user specified file name.

* Create a registry key under 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices 
with the file name of the server file name and a description field of 
either "(Default)" or a user specified description.

* The server will begin listening on UDP port 31337, or a UDP port 
specified by the installer.  You can configure RealSecure to monitor for 
network traffic on the default UDP 31337 port for possible warning signs.
In order to determine if you are vulnerable:

1. Start the regedit program (c:\windows\regedit.exe).
2. Access the key 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices. 
Look for any services that may not have been intentionally installed on the 
machine.  If the length of one of these file is close to 124,928 (give or 
take 30 bytes) then it is probably BO.

Recommended action:
BO can be removed by deleting the server and removing its registry entry. 
 If possible, you should back up all user data, format your hard drive, and 
reinstall all operating systems and software on the infected machine.
However, if someone has installed BO on your machine, then it is most likely 
part of a larger security breach.  You should react according to your site 
security policy.

Determining the password and configuration of an installed BO:
1. Using a text editor like notepad, view the server exe file.
2. If the last line of the file is '8 8$8(8,8084888<8@8D8H8L8P8T8X8\8'8d8h8l8',
then the server is using the default configuration.  Otherwise, the
configuration will be the last several lines of this file, in this order:

<filename>
<service description>
<port number>
<password>
<optional plugin information>

Conclusion:
Back Orifice provides an easy method for intruders to install a backdoor on 
a compromised machine.  Back Orifice's authentication and encryption is 
weak, therefore an administrator can determine what activities and 
information is being sent via BO.  Back Orifice can be detected and 
removed.  This backdoor only works on Windows 95 and Windows 98 for now 
and not currently on Windows NT.

Subject: 50M Lines of Windows NT?

I heard part of National Public Radio's Science Friday on July 24 
called "Beyond Windows" (you can see more -- a list of the guests, 
for instance -- and hear the show at
http://www.sciencefriday.com/pages/1998/Jul/hour1_072498.html).

The part I heard was at the end of the show.  Someone said that it's rumored
Windows NT 5.0 will contain 50M lines of C code.  Several comments followed:
C was too primitive for the task, but C++ was too complex; 30M lines of the
50M are probably IF statements figuring out what environment it's running in
and acting accordingly; isn't 50M lines of code something like what the Star
Wars missile defense system was going to take and nobody thought that would
ever work.

The U.S. Department of Justice is now saying that it does not support the
proposed amendments to the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act
(CALEA) that the FBI had provided to Senators a few weeks ago (See EPIC
Alert 5.10).  Assistant Attorney General Steven Colgate characterizes the
amendment as a "staff document" and describes the language on emergency
access to cell phone location information without a warrant as "boneheaded."
However, Senate staff reports receiving calls from a senior FBI lobbyist
pushing for the amendment even after the New York Times reported on the
Bureau proposal.

Subject: Power surge hits telephones and data comms

From *Sydney Morning Herald*, 5 Aug 1998, p2:

Electronic chaos as exchange overloads
by Andrew Cassell [with JC additions from ABC radio]

Bank computers crashed and data and fax lines were cut across the State
yesterday when a power surge hit Telstra's Haymarket exchange in the city.
The breakdown created extra queues at banks as computers, automatic teller
machines and EFTPOS outlets failed.  TAB [off course betting] agencies
around the State were also affected and 3,500 Telstra customers in Mascot
and 400 in Randwick lost phone services.

The shutdown, between 12.20 pm and 1.20 pm, could have been much worse,
Telstra's public affairs manager, Ms Kerrina Lawrence, said, but fast action
by technicians had stopped the problem spreading through the whole of
Sydney.  [The technicians noticed the surge and moved isolate things
manually.  They then had to do 1000 manual resets.  Mascot and Randwick are
a few km from the affected exchange. Presumably, they didn't move to manual
before the surge hit those exchanges as well.]

Telstra call connect and 013 [Directory Assistance] services had also been
disrupted, and in some cases, disconnected because of the surge, with the
situation made worse by customers clogging up lines trying to get through.
Problems with those services were continuing last night.  [3 of the 5
largest Australian banks reported problems. Commonwealth Bank was affected
until 5 pm.]

Subject: Re: USS Yorktown: WinNT not the fault.

We seem to be too quick to blame WinNT for putting USS Yorktown dead in the
water.  The problem was described as someone entering a zero, after which a
database overflowed and the propulsion system failed.  That sounds like a
bug in an application program, not the esteemed operating system!  We're
unlikely to learn more about the application itself.  Visual A(da), Visual
B(asic), Visual C.  One could easily forget which language one is supposed
to program with.

This leads to the following thought - if a technophobe were intending to
join the modern armed forces, which is the safest branch?  It would
certainly be less comfortable to have the ship handicapped by a systems
failure in the submarine and air force services, and best in the Army where
one could always bring up the backup systems: your feet.

A simple solution: kill two birds with one stone by forcing Microsoft to GPL
the source code to Windows NT.

1. we will finally be able to patch NT to make it secure
   and reliable enough for mission critical applications.

2. the software industry will be freed of an unfriendly tyrant,

Subject: More on SOHO (RISKS-19.87)

*Aviation Week and Space Technology*, 20 Jul 1998

Investigators believe two software errors and an improper command led to a
loss of contact with the NASA/European Space Agency Solar and Heliospheric
Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft on 24 Jun 1998.  Recovery efforts are
underway.  An error in a preprogrammed command sequence resulted in an
incorrect gyroscope reading, sending the spacecraft into an Emergency Sun
Reacquisition (ESR) mode.  A separate command sequence lacked code to
activate a gyro needed for control when the spacecraft entered the ESR mode.
Finally, a decision to command SOHO to turn off a gyro in response to
unexpected telemetry caused the spacecraft to enter a series of ESRs, and
ultimately led to loss of control, the agencies said.

  Due to law enforcement concerns over the similarity of the green, year 
  2000 inspection stickers with the recently expired green stickers

According to *The Guardian* (30 Jul 1998), Railtrack which was formed out of

debugged.  This is a legacy of underfunding over the past 20 years before it
was privatized.  The article quotes Railtrack as having 750 manual level

White House Calm, DoD Nervous About Y2K
By Declan McCullagh (declan@well.com)

Few were surprised when John Koskinen, the White House's Y2K czar, said
yesterday that "it's too early to say that in fact there are going to be
major disruptions" due to the Year 2000 problem.  Koskinen's
work-hard-and-don't-be-scared advice is what the Clinton administration has
been saying all along.

But some of the Y2K experts Koskinen brought with him to a National Press
Club briefing yesterday offered some dismaying details. Usually if, say, a
4,000-megawatt power plant gives up the ghost, it's no big deal. The
electric industry is pretty good at planning for these sorts of
breakdowns. But if dozens crash within a few hours on 1-1-00? "It's a very
complex system," admitted Michael Gent, president of the North American
Electric Reliability Council. "It's probably the most complex system every
invented by man, more complicated than a moon shot." Gent nevertheless
predicted that even if today were December 31, 1999, "the lights would stay
on in most places."

If they go out, it'll be the fault of the private sector, not the feds,
Koskinen said.  Contradicting the now-popular belief that the federal
government's computers are in the worst shape, he predicted that "the
threats to the economy and the public are not going to be federal systems."
[...]

Already prepared to accept his part is John Hamre, deputy secretary of
defense. "I think we're probably going to be the poster child for failure,"
he said last week during a speech to Fortune 500 executives.  "Nobody cares
if the Park Services computers don't come on. OK? But what's going to happen
if some do[n't] in the DoD?"

Anyone looking for a book that puts many of the "software is speech" issues
into sharp focus should get a copy of "Cracking DES: Secrets of Encryption
Research, Wiretap Politics & Chip Design" (ISBN 1-56592-520-3).  This book
describes the DES-cracking machine that was recently in the news when it
broke a 56-bit DES key in less than three days.  The bulk of the book is
also available from John Young's website, <http://jya.com/> -- and legally
so, as the book, with a few small exceptions, is explicitly in the public
domain.  It's also available from the usual web-based booksellers.

You'll find a substantial discussion of the politics of encryption research,
the history of DES cracking, as well as all the source code and hardware
design documents.  This includes well-commented PERL and C source code
(software source code intended to be read), the VHDL code that defines the
custom chips used in the cracking engine, hardware board schematics and
design notes.  The source code is published using checksum tools that
greatly simplify the task of scanning the book to recover the original text.

While non-technical readers would not be expected to understand the computer
source code and/or hardware design, the architecture overview and the
various "political" sections should be well worth reading and within the
grasp of anyone who can get through a Scientific American article without
falling asleep.
