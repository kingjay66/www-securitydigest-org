What you are about to read will shock you.  It shocked me as I did the  research
on the project.  It so completely shocked me that I am lifting the copyright  on
this issue and the one to follow.  Reprint them in any form you choose.
 
Second, I am  sufficently scared about  what I've uncovered  that I am  going to
make this  request.  I  will pay  $1,000 to  the first  person who  blows what I
regard as significant holes in my thesis, and who consents to a 90-minute  taped
interview for  FIRESTORM CHATS.   If you  can't do  this, but  you can put me in
contact  wth  anyone  who  can  refute  me  or  show an effective way out of the
problems I  raise, I  WILL GIVE  YOU A  ONE YEAR  RENEWAL TO  REMNANT REVIEW FOR
LOCATING THE FIRST SUCH PERSON FOR ME,  AND I WILL PAY THE INDIVIDUAL $1,000  TO
DO THE 90-MINUTE TAPED INTERVIEW WITH ME, plus provide supporting evidence.  And
let  me  say,  it  will  be  the  happiest  check-writing session of my life.  I
DESPERATELY WANT TO BE PROVED WRONG.  Mail me your (his) outline.
 
I am going public with this  story because it is unlikely that  any conventional
news source will touch  it, unless pressure is  brougth to bear.  The  reason is
this:  the  problems  are  too  horrendous  even  to be discussed by appropriate
officials, unless they have specific  answers.  But they don't.  What  I present
here  cannot  be  smoothed  over  by  a  press  release  abount  having set up a
blue-ribbon study panel.
 
I literally stumbled into this information.  I had read about one tiny aspect of
it.  I made a  few extrapolations.  Then I  got worried.  The problem  looked as
though it would have major implications.  Little did I know!
 
Every dark cloud has a silver  lining, they say.  Well, every silver  lining has
its  dark  cloud.   This  is  a  "dark  cloud" report about the high tech silver
lining.
 
I am not trying to be deliberately gloomy, but this problem can only get  worse,
unless someone (and I don't know who) can figure out an answer.  I don't like to
present problems in  REMNANT REVIEW for  which I have  no answers.  This  time I
have to do what I don't like to do.  If you've got some answer, WRITE!
 
I am hoping that by going to my  reader I may locate one or more people  who can
provide decent counsel.  Congress hasn't the foggiest idea of the threat that is
now developing to the whole Western world.  When I began this research  porject,
neither did I. Those who  know the facts are so  close to the problem that  they
may have grown jaundiced --  or else they are people  who are the source of  the
problem,  and  they  don't  want  it  solved.  The technicians remain silent, or
discuss  it  only  in  "the  inner  circles"  where  the  issues are understood.
Policy-makers need to know.
 
 
 
                           ELECTRONIC AIDS (Part I)
 
 
Scenario: Paul Volcker is handed a telegram as he enters the monthly meeting  of
the Federal Open Market  Committe.  Every other member  of the FOMC, which  sets
monetary  policy  for  the  U.S.,  is  also  handed  an identical telegram.  The
telegram reads as follows:
 
    THIS MORNING (a rural  bank is named) SUFFERED  A MAJOR FAILURE IN  ITS
    COMPUTER SYSTEM   STOP  ALL  DATA IN  THAT COMPUTER  HAS BEEN SCRAMBLED
    BEYOND RECOGNITION  STOP   WHEN BANK OFFICIALS  ATTEMPT TO CALL  UP THE
    RECORDS FROM ITS BACK UP COMPUTER TAPES THEY WILL FIND THAT THESE  BACK
    UP TAPES  ARE ALSO  SCRAMBLED  STOP   ON MONDAY  AFTERNOON THREE  OTHER
    SMALL BANKS WILL SUFFER  THE SAME FATE  STOP   ONE WILL BE IN  NEW YORK
    CITY  STOP  ONE WILL  BE IN LOS ANGELES   STOP  ONE WILL BE  IN CHICAGO
     STOP  PLEASE MEET AGAIN ON  TUESDAY AFTERNOON  STOP  WE WILL  GIVE YOU
    INSTRUCTIONS AT THAT TIME
 
Volcker  calls  the  appropriate  bureaucrat  at  the  Federal Reserve Systems's
headquarters, and he asks if there are  any reports from the named bank.  A  few
minutes later,  the official  calls back.   The bank's  management confirms  the
breakdown.  The bank is attempting to install the back-up tapes.  Volcker orders
him to call back  and stop the tapes  from being installed.  The  bank complies.
The tapes are then shipped to the Federal Reserve Bank under armed guard.   When
the FED's  computer specialists  acquire the  same operating  system and  try to
bring up the data, the system crashes.  No usable data.
 
Tuesday  morning,  one  by  one  three  banks  call  the  FED, the FDIC, and the
Comptroller of  the Currency's  office, each  with the  same frantic tale.  They
have been  working all  night, but  their computer  records are scrambled.  They
cannot open at 10 a.m.  They have only an hour to make a decision.  What  should
they do?  The FED instructs them to remain closed.  They are also instructed  to
keep their mouths equally closed.
 
The T.V. networks are tipped off, but  no one at any bank says anything.   Lines
appear in front of each bank.  Governers in all three states call frantically to
Washington.  They all remember Ohio and Maryland.  What is the FED going to do?
 
The FOMC, the Board of Governors of the FED, each regional president, and a team
of  computer  experts  meet  at  the  New  York  FED's offices.  At three in the
afternoon, a telegram is delivered to Volcker.  It is brief.  It says:
 
                                     WORMS
 
"What the @%* is this?" he yells to no one in particular.  The computer men turn
white.   They  do  their  best  to  tell  him  what it means.  They are finished
answering his  questions in  about 45  minutes.  Another  telegram arrives.   It
says:
 
    ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON THE CHASE MANHATTAN BANK WILL EXPERIENCE A  SIMILAR
    COMPUTER  FAILURE   STOP   ITS  BACK  UP  TAPES WILL BE EQUALLY USELESS
     STOP   IT  WILL  NOT  BE  ABLE  TO  REOPEN ON MONDAY MORNING  STOP  ON
    TUESDAY  MORNING  CITICORP  WILL  SUFFER  A  SIMILAR  FAILURE  STOP  ON
    WEDNESDAY MORNING BANK OF AMERICA AND THREE OTHER MAJOR BANKS WILL ALSO
    SUFFER A BREAKDOWN   STOP  WE CAN  PROVIDE YOU WITH  THE CORRECTION FOR
    EACH  COMPUTER   STOP   THE  PRICE  WILL  BE  THE REMOVAL OF DIPLOMATIC
    RECOGNITION OF THE  ILLEGITIMATE STATE OF  ISRAEL BY THE  UNITED STATES
    AND AN END TO ALL ECONOMIC AID TO ISRAEL  STOP  TO PROVE THAT WE CAN DO
    THIS WE WILL  SCRAMBLE ALL THE  RECORDS OF CHASE  MANHATTAN BRANCH BANK
    XYZ TOMORROW MORNING  STOP
 
 
The next morning, all of the records of Chase Manhattan's branch bank are turned
into random numbers.  That afternoon, the President of the United States  breaks
off diplomatic relations  with the state  of Israel.  The  banks stay open.   No
crash of the data occurs.  This time.
 
This is hypothetical scenario.  It is NOT hypothetical technologically.  This is
the terrifying message of this issue  the REMNANT REVIEW. what I have  described
here is  conceivable technologically.   On a  small scale,  it has  already been
threatened.  Let's start with the historical and then go the the possible.
 
 
 
                                     WORMS
 
 
Earlier this year, I read a  very interesting article on a major  problem racing
computer software (programs) development companies.   A program comes on one  or
more 5.25-inch plastic discs.  It takes only a few seconds to copy a program  on
one disc to  a blank disc  which costs $3.   Yet these programs  normally run at
least $250, and usually  sell at $495, and  sometimes cost thousands.  Very  few
are less than $100.  So you have a major temptation: make a $500 asset out of  a
$3 asset.  Insert the $500 program into  drive A, write "COPY A:*.* B:" and  hit
the "enter key"; sixty seconds later, you have a $500 program in drive B.
 
There are  ways to  make this  copying more  difficult.  The  companies code the
programs, and force you to have a  control disc in drive A at all  times.  These
"copy protected" programs are a hassle for users.  We cannot put them on a "hard
(big) disc" easily, and sometimes the  control disc dies for some reason.   Then
what?  Your data are locked in your hard disc or on a floppy disc, but you can't
get  to  the  data  because  the  control  disc is not functioning.  You order a
replacement.  Weeks go by.
 
Last year, several firms came up with a solution.  It is called a WORM.  A  worm
is a command which is built deep into the complex code which creates the program
itself.  These are incredibly complex codes, and it is easy to bury a command in
them.  They cannot be traced.
 
What does the worm  do?  It "eats" things.   Say that you are  a software thief.
You  make  a  copy  of  a  non-copy-protected  disc,  either  to use on a second
computer, or to give (or sell) to a friend.  The programs works just fine.   But
when the programs is copied to a new disc, the worm is "awakened."  It bides its
time, maybe for many months, maybe for years.  The programs's user is blissfully
unaware that a monster lurks inside his pirated program.  He continues to  enter
data, make correlations, etc.  HE BECOMES COMPLETELY DEPENDENT ON THE PROGRAM.
 
Then, without warning, the worm strikes.  Whole sections of the data  dispppear.
Maybe the data storage  disc is erased.  Maybe  it is just scrambled.   Even his
back-up data discs have worms in them.  Everything he entered on those discs  is
gone.  Forever.
 
Can you imagine  the consternation of  the user?  He  has become dependent  on a
booby-trapped program.  His business could simply disappear.  For the savings of
$500 (stolen program), he could lose everything he has.
 
Several firms  threatened to  insert worms  into their  programs.  But then they
backed  off.   They  are  afraid  that  lawsuits initiated against them might go
against them in court.   The could be hit  for damages suffered by  the thieving
victims.  Juries might  decide that the  punishment (a bankruptcy)  was too much
for the crime (a $500 theft).
 
So far, no worms are lurking in any commercial software programs -- as far as  I
know and the industry knows, anyway.  But what if a disgruntled programmer  were
to hide one  in a master  copy of, say,  Lotus 1-2-3, the  most popular business
program on the  market?  What if  ten thousand copies  a month go  out for, say,
three years?  Then, without warning,  every company that has started  using them
loses three years of data?  They sue Lotus.  Lotus goes bankupt paying  lawyers.
NO  COMPANY  IN  THE  INDUSTRY  IS  WILLING  TO  TALK ABOUT THIS SABORAGE THREAT
PUBLICLY.  Obviously.
 
 
 
                                  LARCENISTS
 
 
I just happened to  stumble across an article  on worms in a  computer magazine.
It occurred to me that it might be possible to use the worm technique as a  form
of deliberate sabotage rather that just  as a copy protection device.  But  what
did I know?  I'm not a computer expert.
 
I know a computer expert, however.  I mean, a REAL expert -- one of those people
you occasionally read  about.  In the  world of business,  they're called "space
cadets."  They operate somewhere in between the asteroid belt and Jupiter.   But
this one is different.  He's a businessman, too.
 
I got him to sit  down with me to discuss  the problem of worms.  It  turned out
that he  has a  real fascination  for the  topic.  He  tells me  that there  are
advanced  design  worms,  called  'viruses'  by  'hackers'  --  computer   freak
programming genuises.   "The software  virus is  the most  terrifying thing I've
ever come across," he told me.  And then he showed me why.  My initial  scenario
is based on only a portion of his estimation of the treat.  It gets a lot worse.
 
He gave me a 90-minute FIRESTORM CHAT interview.  He must remain anonymous.   He
used to be a software developer for programs that were used in the U.S.  banking
system, by  is now  employed in  a highly  sensitive job  in a related industry.
Therein lies his problem.  IF HE WERE TO TELL THE STORY OF WHAT HE IS CAPABLE OF
DOING TO THESE BANKS, HIS FIRM MIGHT LOSE A LOT OF SALES.  He can't "go public."
Let's call him Tom.
 
Let me summarize briefly some of the details he gave to me.  they floored me.
They're going to floor you.
 
 
 
1.  JACKPOTTING
 
 
The rush is  on in the  banking world to  get automated teller  machines (ATM's)
into shopping malls, supermarkets, and in  front of every bank.  We've all  seen
them.  Just walk up, punch in your card number, ask for cash, and you get it.
 
In a busy location, one of these machines can hold as much as $250,000 in  cash,
mostly small bills.  These machines are controlled by computer.  They are hooked
up to the bank's computer system, usually by phone lines.  This local line,  Tom
tells me,  is what  computer freaks  call THE  LOOP.  The  loop is  wide open to
tampering.  He says that what computer thieves  are doing is to hook up a  cheap
Apple II computer, tie into the phone  lines, break into the ATM, and get  it to
empty itself.  This is "jackpotting."
 
He tells me that banks are  getting hit by ATM thieves continually,  but nothing
is getting to the press.  The banks have yet to show a profit with the ATM's  so
far, which is understandable.  They are  hoping to get their machines placed  in
key locations, so "market share" is crucial to their plans.  They are  suffering
horrendous losses in the  short run in the  hope that long-run profits  will pay
off, if and when a defense is developed.
 
The banks are  saying nothing because  of their fear  that if the  extent of the
losses gets into the press, they  will be forced by pressure from  depositors --
bank runs  -- to  cancel the  ATM's.  The  losses are  horrendous, he  says.  At
present, there is no known defense, given the communications technology.
 
 
 
2.  ROUNDING OFF
 
 
This is the "preferred" computer bank  theft system.  Someone on the inside  who
has access  to the  software, takes  advantage of  the banks'  need to round off
numbers.  The programs carry numbers out to 13 places.  Banks can't use all that
space. so when they balance the books (interest rates at, say, 9.873), they just
don't count  every tenth  of a  cent.  The  program is  assumed to round off the
numbers randomly.   What does  the bank  care?  But  the thief  has set  up bank
accounts that absorb those random tenths  or hundredths of a cent.  In  millions
of dollars  worth of  transactions (federal  funds, etc.),  programmers in  some
cases have stashed away  hundreds of thousands of  dollars -- maybe millions  --
over a few years.  No one knows how much of this goes on.
 
How could a bank spot this?  The  books would always balance to the penny.   How
would the accountants ever know?
 
I think of a story the Adam  Osborne tells in his paperback book, RUNNING  WILD.
The president of a large firm was looking out his window one day, and he noticed
two Rolls Royce cars parked next to  each other.  He enquired as to the  owners.
They  were  two   men  in  the   data  processing  department.    He  called  in
investigators, and the cars  and the men disappeared.   They fled to Brazil  and
took their cars with them; Brazil has no extradition treaty with the U.S.  Years
later, as Osborne was writing the story, the firm still hadn't figured out  what
they has done.
 
 
 
                                   ARSONISTS
 
 
These  are  the  fearful  ones,  far  more  than  the larcenists.  These are the
practical jokers who get into a major  data bank and trash things.  It's a  kind
of multimillion dollar "Kilroy was here" graffiti.
 
How easy is it to get in?  Incredible easy.  The boy in "War Games" really could
have broken  into most  firms telephone-connected  computers.  Computer programs
exist that allow the user to hook  up his computer to a phone line  and randomly
dial numbers until they  hear the tell-tale whine  of a computer line.   It then
notes the phone number and goes on its way, searching out more lines.
 
They can do it by long distance, free of charge.  The phone company has a  tough
time  tracing  those  who  use  various  sorts  of electonic black boxes to call
anywhere on earth at no charge.  Some people get caught, of course.  "The tip of
the iceberg," says Tom.
 
How do they get in?  Easy; few systems are protected, once you locate the  line.
If one is, he says, you create a deliberate error.  Most programs then  collapse
the protective  shell, and  the hacker  finds himself  inside the  heart of  the
system.  Tom  has designed  a program  which keeps  this from  happening to  his
company's programs, but few companies have anything like it.
 
It's very easy  to get in  if someone has  "logged on" --  opened his terminal's
connection to the main  computer -- if the  system is connected to  phone lines.
Or anyone in the company can just tap in, if someone has left his desk and  left
the computer on.  It's common to forget and leave an open terminal.
 
He showed  me.  He  says anyone  can get  fired for  leaving a  computer on.  He
demonstrated his point.  With  40 computers on line,  he ran a quick  search and
found two of them "logged on," despite  the fact that it was after hours.   "All
the security in the  world can't do anything  if a computer line  is open.  It's
like a burglar alarm; it's worthless if you leave the door unlocked or leave the
keys lying around."  That janitor you hired.  Is he a computer illiterate?  Or a
plant?
 
Once inside, what  can you do?   Steal a fortune?   Yes, if you  really know the
system.  He told me he could easily steal $3 million from a local bank, even  as
an outsider.  He would then offer to give it back AND KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT  ABOUT
HOW EASY IT WAS if the bank would pay him 10% of the take.  He thinks most banks
would capitulate  for fear  of the  publicity.  In  any case,  he knows  that he
probably wouldn't get caught.
 
How about creating a new identity?   The grade-changing scene in "War Games"  is
true.  You cound even  create a new identity,  give yourself high grades  in any
academic discipline, just by breaking  into a university's data base.   There is
very little security here, he says.
 
But for sheer  vindictiveness, for sheer  envy, consider the  possibilities of a
virus-implanter.  He gets  inside the computer  for a major  communication link:
telephones, large information data base, bank wire transfer, or whatever.   Then
he lays the egg: a tiny, untraceable brief instruction.  Inside a huge data base
are just  a few  characters.  These  float inside  a system,  seeking to  devour
certain kinds of data, or executing certain routines.
 
There  is  a  game  played  by  computer  freaks called "Core War."  They try to
implant these killer messages, which seek out each other and battle one another.
If you find one morning that yours has been consumed, you lost the battle.  That
was probably the origin of worms and viruses.
 
 
 
                                   TERRORISM
 
 
Say that  a revolutionary  terrorist group,  or some  anti-Zionist group  gets a
"ringer" into the system.  He might  be a computer genius type.  Everyone  knows
they are either orientals, dark-skinned people with accents, or teenagers.   The
firms don't hire teenagers, but they hire a lot foreigners.  They may even check
the guy's credentials.  Electronic credentials.  (Ha!).  Then they turn the  guy
loose in the system.
 
The virus is implanted  deep inside the system.   It can then be  transferred to
any other bank's computer by means of EFT (electronic funds transfer).  Maybe it
is triggered when someone with a peculiar and and address opens a bank  account.
Three days later: bam.   The data disappear.  They  haul out the back-up  tapes.
Bam. The virus is  on them, too.  It  is a process of  INFECTION, CONTAMINATION,
AND INCUBATION.  There is no known defense.  Not yet.  This is the bottom line.
 
 
 
                                  ANTIBODIES
 
 
The  designer  of  a  virus  can  also  design an "antibody".  The antibody is a
counter-virus  agent  which  seeks  it  out  and  destroys  it.   But like other
antibodies, it must be specific.  The only way today that an antibody system can
be created is to know what kind of a virus is involved beforehand.
 
Tom says that  people are now  selling antibodies at  very high prices.   Who is
paying?  Big  companies that  suspect that  there is  a virus  present in  their
computers.   In  all  probability,  THE  GUY  SELLING  THE  ANTIBODY CREATED AND
INJECTED THE  VIRUS.  But  how can  any businessman  prove it?   So he  pays the
blackmail.
 
 
 
                               NATIONAL DEFENSE
 
 
A Soviet agent or American spy working for the Soviets penetrates any of a dozen
computers used by the military.  He plants a virus.  The computers talk to  each
other, and the virus spreads to all of them.  It tells them to execute a certain
routine when  a certain  command is  entered at  a missile-controlling terminal.
That  command  might  interfere  with  a  routine  which  activates a missile or
launches it.  Upon reading that command,  the virus shuts down the computer,  or
scrambles the  executing program,  or scrambles  the data.   No more  "launch on
warning."  No more launch at all.  Dead metal.
 
Scenario: The President of  the United States receives  a telephone call on  the
"red  phone"  --  the  direct  link  to  Moscow.  He lifts the receiver and says
"Hello."
 
"Mr.  President,  this is  Michael Gorbachev.   You must  recognize my voice.  I
have very little time.  I will come directly to the point.  You have refused  to
back down on  your threat to  implement your Strategic  Defense Initiative.  You
intend to go ahead with space-based weapons.  My military staff informs me  that
they think that the United States  has the technology to implement it,  and that
it would place my nation's military  strategy in jeopardy.  We cannot allow  you
to do this."
 
"If we  allow you  to deploy  the SDI,  it will  be too  late for  us to respond
effectively.  Therefore, we  are taking the  initiative today.  I  issued orders
this morning to put Soviet military units on immediate alert.  We are abiding by
your biblical rule  to announce the  initiation of hostilities  before striking.
Neither the Japanese nor the Germans gave us this courtesy.  If you do not  come
to terms with  us, we will  launch a first  strike against your  nation in three
hours.  We will delay  for one day, if  you agree to follow  a precise procedure
that I will outline shortly."
 
"At one time we feared nuclear retaliation.  We no longer do.  Within two hours,
you will know why not.  I suggest that you instruct your ballistic missile  team
to prepare your missiles  for a strike.  Then,  to prove to yourself  that we no
longer are concerned about retaliation, launch one or two of them.  As far as  I
am concerned,  launch all  of them.   But please  instruct your  senior military
commanders to report back to you concerning the effects of their instruction.  I
suggest that you  try launching three  or four as  a test.  We  don't care which
ones."
 
"Mr.  President, let  me tell you  what is going  to happen.  As  soon as anyone
attempts to launch a missile, that missile's computer guidance system will  shut
down.  It will lock up tight, and you  will not be able to unlock it within  the
time you need to respond to our attack.  Two hours and thirty minutes from  now,
you finally unlock your frozen computers."
 
"I suggest that you contact your senior officers now.  You will have to mobilize
them  within  60  minutes.   The  test  should  take  about  30 minutes.  I will
telephone you again in 90 minutes to present our terms of surrender."  Click.
 
The President calls the Joint Chiefs.  If he is lucky, he will be able to locate
two of the three in time.  They will be paralyzed.  Who wouldn't be?  But in all
likelihood, they will at least test Gorbachev's theory.  They will order one  or
two missiles launched.  The computer guidance system on both will shut down  the
system.  They  will try  two or  three more,  with the  same result.   They will
attempt to launch one from a submarine, with the same result.
 
The President brings in senior  Congressional officials and the remaining  Joint
Chiefs member to the White House.
 
Exactly 90 minutes after he had hung up, Gorbachev telephones back.  He presents
his list of demands.  First, the  immediate removal of U.S. troops from  Europe.
Second,  the  withdrawal  of  personnel  from  Diego Garcia Island in the Indian
Ocean.  Third, the breaking of  diplomatic relations with Red China  and Taiwan.
Fourth, the removal of all troops from Korea.  Fifth, a moratorium on all  debts
owed  to  U.S.  banks  by  the  Soviet  Union and its client states.  Sixth, the
removal of all Minuteman III missiles from their silos.  Seventh, the return  of
all U.S. submarines to port.  If he agrees, and the orders are delivered  within
two hours, the Soviet Union will delay launching a first strike.  The  President
complies.
 
They might do it with our communications satellites, Tom says.  You might do  it
with any aspect  of U.S. data  transmission.  The virus  could sit dormant  in a
system for years, and no one would know.  Triggered, it would then strike.
 
 
 
                           THE WEST'S VULNERABILITY
 
 
The  West  has  become  increasingly  dependent  on computers.  We can no longer
function without them.  The Third World hasn't.  Neither has the U.S.S.R.  Their
technology is still pre-computer.  They  are inefficient, but they are  far less
vulnerable.
 
Tom  says  that  the  world  of  computers  presumes  that  almost  everyone  is
essentially honest, and that all the brightest programmers must be honest.  They
aren't.  Thus,  the entire  system --  banks, national  defense, large and small
businesses, public utilities -- have opened themselves to attack.  The attackers
are invisible.
 
"Nothing I have  seen in all  my years of  computers scares me  as much as  this
does," he says.  "The system  has been designed in terms  of a far older set  of
standards, especially with respect to security.  It is totally vulnerable."
 
He  compares  it  to  plague,  or  venereal  disease.   People copy each other's
software to  save a  few bucks.   They use  public access  data bases.  They use
"loops"-- the  phone lines.   Yet these  transmission belts  of information  can
become transmission belts of collapse.
 
This is what I have harped on for twenty years: the potential for a collapse  of
the division of labor.  We become  rich by means of a brilliant  technology, yet
we become dependent on it to an extent that no previous society ever has.
 
Centralized  institutions  are  most  vulnerable,  but  because  we  use  public
transmission lines, from microwave transmissions  to cables in the ground,  each
local unit is vulnerable.  Those who would choose to bring down the system  need
only plant electronic  viruses in a  handful of major  common-use data bases  or
transmission sources, and five years or ten years later, the disease hits.
 
It could  brings down  the system  if technological  defenses are not developed.
Nothing on the immediate horizon points to a solution, he says.  The silence  of
those who should know what to do indicates that they don't know what to do,  but
they don't want panic to spread.

                           ELECTRONIC AIDS (PART 2)
 
 
(Again, note that this issue  of REMNANT REVIEW is not  copyrighted.  Reproduce
it in any form you choose.  This information needs wide dispersal.)
 
Maybe you saw the article buried somewhere in your newspaper.  I saw it in  the
New York Times (Oct. 19):
 
         A group of at least  23 teen-age computer users broke  into a
         Chase Manhattan  Bank computer  installation by  telephone in
         July and August and "significantly damaged" bank records, the
         Federal Bureau of Investigation said yesterday.
 
And where were  these teenagers located?   In San Diego,  ACROSS THE CONTINENT!
It gets even more ludicrous:
 
         Federal  officials  said  that  most  of  the  offenders were
         probably too young to be prosecuted.
 
         Robert D.  Rose, the  Asst.  United  States Attorney handling
         the case, said: "We're not yet sure what we are going to  do.
         But these things  can get out  of hand --  it did get  out of
         hand -- and we have to treat them seriously."
 
Treat WHAT  seriously.  "These  THINGS?"  What  things?  If  they can't legally
treat the electronic trespassers seriously, just what is the man talking about?
He is talking about the topic, above all other topics, that bank and government
officials don't want to face: THE VULNERABILITY OF THEIR COMPUTER RECORDS.
 
I have  seen no  follow-up on  this story  in the  conventional press.  A brief
article did appear in the  computer-oriented tabloid, INFOWORLD (Oct. 28).   It
turns out that the students had broken into the files of Interactive Data Corp.
of Waltham, Massachusetts, which  maintains the bank's financial  records.  The
break-ins were discovered  in late July.   They had obtained  the toll-free 800
number which was restricted (ha!) to Interactive data subscribers.  As late  as
October 9, an illegal  entry was observed.  In  short, IT TOOK TEN  WEEKS AFTER
THE BREAK-INS WHERE DISCOVERED TO PUT A STOP TO THEM.
 
The response of the bank's bureaucracy was predictable.  It will ever be  thus:
"Bank  officials  are  claiming  that  the  FBI  exaggerated  the nature of the
activities of the  suspected individuals.  A  spokesperson for Chase  Manhattan
said  that  Interactive's  customers  were  not  prevented from accessing their
accounts and that none of Interactive's data was altered or manipulated in  any
way."  In  response, FBI  supervisory agent  John Kelso  said that  the FBI has
sworn affidavits  from bank  officials that  say data  has been  manipulated or
damaged.  "That sounds pretty serious to me," he volunteered.
 
Here is the capper: Interactive Data  has 25,000 subscribers who are tied  into
that toll-free phone line.  Try keeping tight security on a system with  25,000
users.  Chase Manhattan couldn't.  If they can't, who can?
 
And if Chase Manhattan Bank was vulnerable to 23 teenagers who are too young to
prosecute, consider its vulnerability to JUST ONE ENVY-DRIVEN GENIUS who  knows
all about electronic viruses.  The  students who did this were  apparently just
goofing around.  But what if just one malevolent computer freak decided to "get
even" with  Chase Manhattan?   What if  he had  phoned in  just once  or twice,
implanted a long-dormant data-killing virus, and quit?  What if he had tied its
detonation to, say, a calendar clock  in the Interactive computer?  If it  took
security forces  from July  until early  October 15  to raid  the 23  students'
homes, they would never have spotted one break-in.  They could not have  traced
it, either.  Conclusion: we have a risk-free opportunity for electronic  arson.
We face  a potential  electronic epidemic.   AND WHEN  I SAY  "WE," I  MEAN THE
ENTIRE FINANCIAL SYSTEM OF THE WEST.
 
Sure, all the bank  "spokespersons" in the world  will tell you, "no  problem."
But there is a problem.  A horrendous problem.
 
At  this  point,  it  REALLY  gets  interesting.  Chase Manhattan Bank has just
announced that we will  be able to set  up our own personal  electronic banking
facilities with  them by  buying an  expanded version  of Managing  Your Money,
Andrew Tobias' home financial management program.  Citicorp and Bank of America
have opted for  Dollars and Sense,  a rival program.   You will be  able to pay
monthly bills electronically, balance your "checkbook," monitor your net worth,
buy  and  sell  stocks,  etc.,  etc.,  etc.,  just be dialing Citicorp or Chase
Manhattan.  Fantastic!  But despite all the assurances, I get nervous.  Yes,  I
know no  one will  be able  to break  in and  tamper with  the numbers.  But 23
teenagers shouldn't have  been able to  do it, either.   And now we're  talking
about a lot more subscribers than 25,000.
 
Obviously,  the  master  program  used  by  the banks will prohibit easy entry.
Unfortunately, someone has to write the program.  Can you imagine the blackmail
possibilities?   Some  hot-shot  programmer  could  build  in  a bomb, and then
threaten to detonate it.  In fact,  he could merely pretend to have  inserted a
virus.  Who would want to call his bluff?  Not Chase Manhattan, I would bet.
 
 
 
                             CORE WARS REVISITED
 
 
In May  of 1984,  A.K. Dewdney  published an  article in  Scientific American's
"Computer Recreations" column.   It was a  light-hearted piece on  how computer
experts  can  get  involved  in  playing  this  exciting  game of "blow up your
opponent's defenses."  You know: RECREATION!  In the March 1985 issue, he wrote
a follow-up.  It begins:
 
         When the column about Core War appeared last May, it had  not
         occurred  to  me  how  serious  a  topic  I  was raising.  My
         descriptions of  machine-language programs,  moving about  in
         memory and trying  to destroy each  other, struck a  resonant
         chord.   According  to  many  readers,  whose stories I shall
         tell, there are abundant examples of worms, viruses and other
         software  creatures  living  in  every  conceivable computing
         environment.   SOME  OF  THE  POSSIBILITIES ARE SO HORRIFYING
         THAT I HESITATE TO SET THEM DOWN AT ALL (emphasis added.)
 
It turns out that  the French have been  enjoying a novel on  the international
implications, SOFTWAR: LA GUERRE DOUCE,  by Breton and Beneich.  A  translation
is  scheduled  for  publication  here  by  Holt, Rinehart & Winston.  The study
revolves around the  sale of a  high-power computer to  the Soviet Union.   The
U.S. allows its export because it has  a "software bomb" in it.  When the  U.S.
Weather Service  announces a  certain temperature  at St.  Thomas in the Virgin
Islands, the program proceeds to subvert every piece of software in the  Soviet
Union.
 
A pair of Italian programmers  were "inspired" by the translation  of Dewdney's
original article to dream up a virus (a virus is a computer-to-computer killer,
whereas a worm is  resident in one man's  computer).  They figured out  that by
infecting a  disk operating  system disk  (these start  computers and tell them
what to do with programs and electronics), and then installing it on disks used
by the biggest computer shop in the city, they could create an epidemic.   They
decided not to do it.  In short, the only restraint is SELF-RESTRAINT.
 
A high school student in Pittsburgh wrote a virus which was more subtle than  a
data-destroying virus, which  at least tells  us that we  have a problem.   His
virus created  a plague  of very  subtle errors  in the  disk operating system.
"All of this seems pretty juvenile," he wrote, but "Oh woe to me!  I have never
been able to get rid of my electronic plague.  It infested all of my disks, and
all  of  my  friends'  disks.   It  even  managed to get onto my math teacher's
graphing disks."  He wrote a program  to destroy the virus (an "antidote")  but
it is not anywhere near as effective as the virus is.
 
Warning: do not copy disks from your friends' copies.  This act of piracy could
cost you plenty.
 
 
 
                              A COMMERCIAL WORM
 
 
Just a few days after I wrote "Electronic AIDS, Part I," I read a column in the
WASHINGTON TIMES, the conservative  (Moonie-owed) daily newspaper.  One  of the
reporters  has  a  computer.   He  had  purchased a newly released program from
Microsoft Co., called  "Access."  Understand that  Microsoft supplies the  disk
operating system which is used by  the IBM PC, the most popular  microcomputer.
In other words,  this is no  backyard company.  It  is one of  the two or three
software  giants  in  the  U.S.  (Its  owner  is  under age 30, which tells you
something about who is pinoeering the microcomputer revolution.)
 
As he was setting up his computer to take advantage of this  telecommunications
program, a  warning flashed  on his  screen: "The  weed of  crime bears  bitter
fruit.  Now  trashing your  program disk."   Wham!  He  lost all  his files  --
probably a couple of year's worth of work.  Sure, he was probably smart  enough
to have made back-up copies, but think of the risk.  And what if it had been  a
worm that kept silent for a few years, infecting all of his back-up disks?
 
He called Microsoft, and they gave him the runaround.  They told him that  they
were not  responsible.  Some  programmer had  put in  the worm  in order to zap
program pirates,  but the  journalist insisted  that he  was an original buyer.
Tough luck, they told him.  Obviously, they didn't know that he was a reporter.
 
Then  he  published  his  article.   All  of  a sudden, the victim was not some
average buyer.  He  was big trouble.   Things started moving.   INFOWORLD (Oct.
28) reports that Microsoft has admitted that a programmer put in the worm,  but
without permission.  The offending text  has now been removed, we  are assured.
But what if it had sat in the master for three years?  HERE IS THE PREMIER FIRM
IN THE SOFTWARE BUSINESS, AND IT HAD AN UNAUTHORIZED PROGRAMMER INSERT A  WORM.
This  is  not  idle  speculation.   It  has  already  happened,  verfiying   my
hypothetical scenario within a few days after I published it.
 
Can you imagine the absolute havoc that a dormant worm or virus could create if
it were imbedded in  all updates of Microsoft's  masters of PC DOS  and MS DOS,
the  operating  systems   for  all  IBM   microcomputers  and  IBM   compatible
microcomputers?   It   could  cost   the  U.S.   economy  billions,   and  some
microcomputer-dependent firms  wouldn't survive.   Any Microsoft  spokesman who
says, "it's impossible; it  could never happen" has  to explain how it  already
did happen to "Access."
 
 
 
                            ADAM OSBORNE'S WARNING
 
 
You may  know the  name Adam  Osborne.  He  invented the revolutionary portable
computer, the  Osborne 1.   Before there  was an  Osborne 2,  the company  went
bankrupt.  Compaq, the  most successful first-year  firm in U.S.  history (over
$100  million  in  sales  in  its  12  months  of  operations) and others built
imitations that were far superior.
 
That isn't my point,  however.  Adam Osborne was  "present at the creation"  of
the microcomputer industry.  He created Osborne publications, and then sold out
to McGraw Hill.  He knows what is going on.  In his delightful paperback  book,
RUNNING WILD, which  is a history  of the microcomputer  (desk top) revolution,
1975-82,  he  offers  this  warning.   He  says  that three areas should not be
allowed to be computerized: 1) bank  money transfers; 2) the stock market;  and
3) elections.
 
All three are just about fully computerized.  Another ten years, or maybe five,
and they will be 100%  computerized.  Several firms allow microcomputer  buying
and selling of stock (e.g., Charles Schwab), and New York Stock Exchange  floor
transactions eventually will  be fully computerized,  at which time  it will be
pressured to get rid of  the "specialists" who make (and  sometimes manipulate)
the market, short-term  -- Richard Ney's  hated "Wall Street  Gang" -- but  the
price of getting rid of them may turn out to be horrendously high.
 
"The  great  fortunes  of  the  21st  century,"  Osborne predicts, "will be the
legacies of the great computer thieves of the 20th."
 
Three years ago, I used a firm to supply computer services I needed.  The  head
of it was a  former businessman, quite young,  and a true "space  cadet."  I've
quoted him  in the  last issue.   I call  him Tom.  He operated  in a world far
removed mentally from the rest of us.  He is a nice fellow, a Christian, and  a
moral philosopher of sorts.
 
He ran the operations of the local elections.  He did it fairly  inexpensively.
He told me why: "I want to keep these elections honest.  It would be incredibly
simple to rig the program to produce whatever outcome I wanted in close  races.
If I can do it, anyone with enough skill to set up the system could do it."
 
I asked him  if he thought  Osborne was correct  in his predictions  about bank
theft.  "It would be a piece of cake for me to steal three or four million from
any local bank.  I could  go in the next week,  offer to give 90% of  the money
back, keep 10% as a finder's fee, and promise not to tell the press how easy it
was to steal.  They would probably pay me my 10% just to keep me quiet."
 
Look, these people  are geniuses.  Worse,  they are geniuses  in a vary  narrow
field technically, which is now  being used to control darned  near everything.
This  unique  intellectual-technical  skill  is  the  possession of literally a
handful of people,  mostly under 35  years of age.   They are "fooling  around"
with Chase Manhattan Bank's  computers.  What happens when  a few of them  stop
fooling around and get deadly serious?
 
Computer program designers keep telling us that there is no 100% secure way  to
defend data banks.  Maybe  there will be a  98% secure system someday,  but not
now.  THE SYSTEM RELIES ON THE INTEGRITY OF YOUTH TO DEFEND ITSELF.  In  short,
SELF-GOVERNMENT is the major defense.
 
And where have they learned self-discipline?  In the public schools?
 
 
 
                            "NOW YOU'VE DONE IT!"
 
 
About four years ago, I read an article in the ROLLING STONE, the tabloid aimed
at rock music fans.   It was the only  article I ever read  in that periodical.
It was a gem.
 
It described a subculture of students at Stanford University, "hackers."  These
people are computer freaks.  The mainframe computer at Stanford was cheaper  to
use after midnight, so from midnight  to 6 a.m., the hackers gathered  at their
terminals.  They lived on candy bars, junk food, and high-technology dreams.
 
One of the games they played  was breaking into each other's programs.   It was
considered the mark  of a master  hacker to be  able to crack  another hacker's
defenses.  They would spend hours trying.  They were "hacker-crackers."
 
One bright fellow then designed a classic booby trap.  He wrote a program which
warned  trespassers  not  to  tamper  withit.   This,  of course, alerted every
would-be electronic safe-cracker to the  challenge.  It was a complex  program,
and it took days  to crack it.  Then,  after repeated warnings, the  successful
trespasser got a surprise.  Japanese  letters appeared on his screen.   Roughly
translated, the words proclaimed, "Now you've done it!"
 
At that point, the victim's computer screen went blank.  Then the names of  all
his own  computer files  appeared on  the screen  -- files  that may have taken
years to assemble.  One  by one, they blipped  off the screen.  In  horror, the
victim would stare at the screen, unable to stop the process.
 
As it turned out, the booby trap  was only a practical joke.  It really  didn't
erase all the victim's files.  It only listed the NAMES, and then erased  them.
But for a horrifying few minutes, the victim wouldn't know this.
 
Hackers play games.  Very interesting games.
 
The kind of  people who spend  six hours, midnight  to 6 a.m.,  trying to break
into each  other's programs  are different  from the  rest of  us.  Among their
ranks are some highly individualistic  people.  Some of them are  libertarians.
I mean anarchists.  They  are electronic "don't tread  on me" sorts of  people.
They do not appreciate bureaucracy.   They appreciate being pushed around  even
less.
 
The folks  at Chase  Manhattan really  do have  a problem.   Do you  attempt to
prosecute a  legally unprosecutable  kid?  A  kid who  has already cracked your
computer  system?   I  don't  think  you  do.   You  play the role of stern but
appreciative banker.  "Son, I  am impressed by your  ability to break in.   But
understand, we are honest people.  There is a code of honor here.  You wouldn't
want to break that code -- of honor, I mean -- would you?"  Because if this kid
gets angry, he can do it again.  Quietly.  And next time, he deposits a virus.
 
Of course, Chase may hire a  programming team to create an unbreakable  system.
Sure.  "Hire fox  A. Give him  chain link fence  B. Hire him  to build fence  B
around chicken coop C."
 
 
 
                                TEEN CHALLENGE
 
 
Suppose that the  public gets wind  of the threat  to the whole  banking system
which is posed by  viruses?  What do the  bankers (or anyone else)  announce to
the public?  "We want to assure you that our computer program is  impenetrable.
No one can break in.  It is foolproof."
 
Here is a challenge -- rather like the Stanford program that announced: "Do not
trespass."  These kids see breaking in  as a challenge, a kind of  sport.  They
do not regard it as vandalism, even  if it costs a company millions of  dollars
to unscramble.  They may be ethical in other respects, but they think of  "core
wars" as a game.
 
How would you like  to be the 60-year-old  banker who doesn't know  a byte from
usury, but  whose public  relations department  tells him  to inform the public
that nobody can crack his bank's code?  To cite Mr. T in "Rocky III," that bank
is dead meat.  So are its depositors.
 
But if he keeps quiet, and the story still gets out about the vulnerability  of
the system, one or two small "virus-demolished" banks could trigger a  collapse
of the  system, as  people do  the only  smart thing:  run for CASH.  The whole
fractional  reserve  banking  system  would  deflate;  only  the FED's printing
presses could "save the day," in a wave of fiat money.
 
What I  am saying  is this:  I THINK  THAT WE  WILL SEE  THE END  OF FRACTIONAL
RESERVE BANKING IN OUR DAY. At the very least, I think we will see it subjected
to tremendous shocks.   People will lose  faith in electronic  promises made by
bureaucrats who do  not know anything  about the monsters  that their efficient
computers can be turned into.
 
 
 
                            ATTACK ON MARTINSBURG
 
 
Now, let's take it a step  farther.  Some day some state or  Federal bureaucrat
is going  to step  on the  toes of  some genius  entrepreneur who has created a
software development firm.  The bureaucrat  will try to wrap this  enterpreneur
in red tape.  Or maybe -- just maybe -- he will try to sock him with a tax bill
that the entrepreneur regards as unfair.
 
In Martinsburg,  West Virginia,  there is  a large  computer.  It  is owned and
operated by the Internal Revenue Service.   Into it, over the next five  years,
the IRS apparently intends to deposit all the records it can assemble on  every
US taxpayer.  This computer data base will be the biggest in the world.  It  is
the tool by which  the IRS hopes to  increase taxpayer compliance.  And  it may
succeed.  For a while.
 
This is  one reason  for saving  all letters  to and  from the  IRS. If the IRS
becomes  dependent  on  its  computer   system,  which  is  likely,  then   any
short-circuiting of its  data base could  create havoc for  tax collecting.  If
word gets  out that  a major  failure has  hit the  IRS, the  tax revolt  could
multiply overnight.  You would see the deficit become astronomical.  If the IRS
continues  to  tie  its  "voluntary"  compliance  program  to  the myth of "the
all-seeing computer," then news of the computer's scrambling could backfire.
 
It is  possible that  the story  of the  IRS data  base is  a myth.  Maybe they
aren't going to build it.  But if the public believes that such computer  power
is at the disposal of the IRS, and taxpayers then learn either that the  system
has been blown, or  that it was mythical  from the start, the  tax revolt could
spread like  an epidemic.   The elctronic  epidemic could  trigger a tax revolt
epidemic.
 
He who lives on the cutting  edge of technology eventually dies on  the cutting
edge of technology.
 
 
 
                         "PEOPLE ARE BASICALLY GOOD"
 
 
Let's return to my  taped interview with "Tom."   In a 90-minute interview,  we
covered a lot  of ground.  But  one topic which  stands out in  my mind is  our
discussion of the  presupposition which goes  into the creation  of a computer-
based  society.   The  computer  people  have  all adopted the assumption which
undergirds modern  science, namely,  that participants  are well-meaning,  that
they  will  not  fake  their  experiments,  and  that  they will play fair.  If
scientists  had  to  check  every  aspect  of  every article, science could not
advance very fast.
 
What about the computer  industry?  The whole system  rests on faith: "Men  are
not malevolent..  They are not envy-driven.  They will not deliberately seek to
destroy the  work of  some random  victim."  Tom  says categorically  thay this
assumption is false.  There are bad people with tremendous computer skills, and
that modern society has not  restructured its economic institutions to  protect
itself.
 
Here is one example  of a break-in technique.   Someone phones into a  computer
which has been left open temporarily  by some user.  The lock is  unlatched; he
needs no  key to  get in.   He then  seeks to  penetrate te  inner core  of the
program, such as a  bank's program.  He creates  a deliberate error, which  all
too  ofter  triggers  a  kind  of  electronic  explosion.  The protective shell
self-destructs, and the invader now finds himself inside the system, where  far
fewer defense mechanisms exist.
 
Tom  designed  his  own  firm's  defense  against  this  tactic.   His  program
automatically records the source of the  error, and throws the user out  of the
program.  The  program has  protection against  deliberate errors,  but most of
them don't, he says.  A major error simply simply collapses the program's outer
shell.
 
In my previous issue, I speculated  that a Soviet spy or agent  could penetrate
U.S.  computers.   Note:  I  did  not  assume  that he would simply phone in; I
assumed  that  a  disloyal  programmer,  or  a  team,  could plant the virus as
insiders.  From there, the virus would spread though the system through  normal
telecommunications.  Several people have written  in to tell me that  a wrecker
cannot destroy  the system  by penetrating  it from  the outside.   They may be
correct.  But when informed  that I am assuming  an INSIDE JOB by  someone with
access  to  a  major  computer,  the  critics  have admitted that this might be
possible.
 
The weed of crime bears bitter fruit: FOR HONEST, COMPUTER-DEPENDENT PEOPLE.
 
 
 
                                FEDERAL FUNDS
 
 
The Federal Funds  bank transfer lines  allow banks to  borrow money overnight.
Hundreds of billions of dollars go  across these lines every working day.   The
bank's   computers   communicate   with   each   other   by   means   of   this
telecommunications hook-up.  What if someone  were to plant a long-delay  virus
in  the  software  which  operates  these  transfers?  And what banker ahs even
thought about this problem?
 
What if this scenario  were to take place:  A virus triggers the  disruption of
bank records -- not a total  breakdown initially, but disruptions in the  data?
It  might  be  weeks  or  months  before  auditors recognized the extent of the
problem.
 
As rumors begin to leak  out about complex accounting or  other data-management
problems of major banks all  over the U.S. (including off-shore  branches), the
various banking regulatory  agencies would be  swamped with crises  and outside
rumors.  Then, all at once, bank computers begin breaking down.
 
The rumors then explode.  The lines appear in front of banks.  The only  answer
at this point is to print up paper money.  It would be printed by the  hundreds
of billions in  order to offset  the deflationary effects  of bank runs  (paper
money which is pulled out but redeposited in another bank).
 
YOU COULD TOPPLE THE FRACTIONAL RESERVE BANKING SYSTEM ALL OVER THE WORLD.  The
entire  payments  system  could  easily  become  engulfed in chaos.  Debits and
credits would  no longer  be meaningful.   A pure  paper money  inflation would
replace  the  manipulated  "fine-tuned"  monitary  inflation  of modern central
banking.
 
All of a  sudden, market-created alternative  currencies would be  revived.  It
would  the  be  METALLIC  CASH  that  talks  loudest.   Silver  dimes  are  not
electronic.  They can't be infected electronically.  They still circulate  when
banks are "temporarily closed, due to circumstance beyond our control."
 
The  loss  of  efficiency  would  be  initially horrendous, I would guess.  The
division of labor would break down.   You could that have the crash  that lurks
in the minds and suspicions of average depositors.  Who says it cannot  happen?
A lot of public relations firms  hired by the banks -- computer  illiterates in
high places?
 
What  we  have is  AN  INTERNATIONAL  BANK  MONEY  WIRE SYSTEM which is TOTALLY
VULNERABLE to  some vindictive  programmer.  There  is little  doubt in my mind
that the bankers are desperatesly fearful of this sort of vandalism.  It  could
topple  people's  confidence  in  the  fractional  reserve  banking system, and
confidence is the only thing which keeps it going.
  
 
                                  CONCLUSION
 
 
Technologically, there  is no  solution at  this point.   I have  no heartening
message.  Maybe later; not now.  Keep precious metal coins.  Don't assume  that
it  an't  happen  here.   It  can.   The  only  thing  holding  it  back is the
restraining  hand   of  God,   through  the   temporary  self-restraint   of  a
technological priesthood.
