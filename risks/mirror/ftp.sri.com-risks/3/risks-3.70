One of the nice things about computer-driven controls, as opposed to
mechanical controls, is that they allow you to be less draconian in
specifying limits.  You don't have to build a bomb release that can never,
ever allow the pilot to drop a bomb while inverted; you can instead say "You
know, if I do what you've asked, the bomb is going to fall on the wing and
probably strip off your starboard control surfaces." and the pilot can say
"Yes, I know, do it anyway."  And by providing a (safety-covered and
hard-to-reach) button that says "Override control limits" you can even make
it possible for the pilot to say in advance that at this point she feels the
danger in overriding the controls is smaller than the danger in not
overriding the controls.

The reason we think it's reasonable to require automated controls to allow
exceptions is that we know the automated controls have allowed and
encouraged us to incorporate limits and we recognize that (1) those limits
may have erred on the side of normal safety, (2) since the systems are new,
the necessary operational envelope may not be known, and (3) the interaction
of the limits may create unanticipated problems.  Yes, users should be
allowed to override automated controls in almost all cases AND designers
should make very, very sure that the effort to override is proportional to
the danger of the override.  In many cases there should also be logging of
overrides, so that operators, maintainers, and designers have an opportunity
to notice that actual use seems to be violating the design assumptions.

I wonder how many readers of this list [NO, this is NOT a survey, DON'T
write to tell me] drive cars with manual transmissions precisely because
they want to be in control, want to know that doing x and y will result in
the car doing z, without any control system in the way to place limits on
actions or responses...

Today's AP noted that the FAA may cite the pilot of the Grumman Yankee for
being in restricted airspace, at precisely the moment of the crash between
the Aeromexico jet and the Piper Archer (which was also in restricted
airspace), which distracted the air traffic controller from attending to the
jet and the Piper (the absence of whose altitude information was also a
factor) -- at precisely the time the crash occurred.  The controller did
tell the Grumman pilot that he was in restricted air space, but then granted
him permission to continue (and that negotiation took two precious minutes
away from his attention to the jet).

A computer of the AAAS sent out renewal bills for SCIENCE to some subscribers:
                 Subscription price $6647, Postage $732, 
                 Voluntary contribution $10, Total $5437.
The subscription price during 1986 was $60, and the accompanying letter from
the president of AAAS noted that inflation had required an increase.  A quite
amusing editorial by Daniel Koshland, Jr. in the 26 Sept 86 issue wondered 
whether any people would rush out to take advantage of the incorrect addition.

A minor correction to Chuck Fry's comments - the first anti-skid system on a
production car was installed on a Jensen (pre-dating the Jensen-Healey) in
the 60s. It was made by Lockheed, and derived directly from aircraft systems.

Subject:  Sanity in Automating Keyword Abstracting

Here is an example of a risk associated with the use of computers.  The risk
is to the accurate dissemination of information and is caused by faulty
programming (programmers?).

Today, the BRL Librarian informed us that the Defense Technical Information
Center (DTIC, formerly known as DDC) now requires that the titles of our
technical reports (the principal products of a research lab such as the BRL)
be written so that the "keywords" are found in the first five words of the
title.

Thus, a report which formerly was titled "Communication Modeling in the
Artillery Control Experiment" with keywords "error control," "tactical
communications," "networks," and "modeling" would have to be titled
"Modeling, Tactical Communications, and Error Control Networks," thus
sounding like, as one chap here put it, "a four volume set by Harry van
Trees" instead of a 25 page report.

Exact text of our librarian's notice follows:

There has been an enormous amount of difficulty in dealing with the ARPANET
since early September, perhaps related to the installation of new IMP
software and subsequent patches when the new release did not work properly.
I had devastating problems TELNETing from four different East-coast hosts to
three different SRI systems (irrespective of whether there was a gateway at
my end, and even with no loads on either system).  No answers have been
forthcoming from any of our gurus, so the problems remain pervasive and
painful.  I am also getting a rash of returned net-barfed RISKS mail (as
well as RISKS filling up peoples' directories when they go on vacation).
There are also local problems.  Last Friday a message from SRI-STRIPE to
SRI-CSL took 7 hours to be delivered, while TN and FTP between those two
machines worked fine.

  From: David L. Edwards <DLE@SRI-STRIPE.ARPA>
  It is becoming increasingly apparent that there are serious network
  problems.  There has been some discussion of this on the TCPIP forum.
  Network delays, failed connections, inability to make connections etc. are
  being reported by hosts all over the network.

  BillW has noticed that direct communications between SRI and SU are bad.  In
  your case there are one or two gateways involved in addition to the IMPs.
  The mailer recently reported 750+ attempted connections with 670+ failures.

Old age?  Software rot?  Incompatible changes to net software?  Saturation?
Who knows.  Stay tuned.
