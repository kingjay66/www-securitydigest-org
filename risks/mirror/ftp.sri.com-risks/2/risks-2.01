To: RISKS@SRI-CSL.ARPA

With RISKS-1.45, my MM saturated completely on its ability to cope with all
of the Volume 1 issues of the RISKS Forum (at 289 pages) in one .TXT file,
so it must be time to start Volume 2! Thus, let me take this opportunity to
review the six months since RISKS Volume 1 Issue 1, on 1 August 1985.

The SDI pallaver seems to have overwhelmed some of you, but it has opened up
some serious problems -- as does the unreleased Eastport Report, which is
perhaps most interesting for what it does not cover! (You may have concluded
that SDI is a religious issue that cannot be decided rationally?)  The Space
Shuttle tragedy also opens up all sorts of questions on how much trust we
can place in technology and what the risks are -- although those questions
have been around all along.  They are simply elevated to a higher level of
public awareness now (temporarily?).  For example, the issue of the safety
of self-destruct mechanisms has been lurking, and is clearly a concern in
general -- but is only one concern.  There are lots of others.  We must
remember that risks come many sources -- not just from maliciousness and
accidents, but also from unforeseen combinations of problems.

So far we have addressed many important issues, although some of them quite
superficially.  We have overlapped on occasions with ARMS-D, Soft-Eng, and
Security distributions.  However, it seems that RISKS does provide a focus
that cuts across these other mailings, and that it serves a useful purpose
-- particularly when it indeed focuses on the risks to the public.

A few platitudes are in order:

  No system is ever going to be 100% guaranteed all of the time,
  especially if it runs standalone.  Even with humans in the loop, 
  humans can make mistakes -- especially in real-time.

  Risks may come from unexpected directions.  A system that has run
  perfectly may still suddenly malfunction.  Hardware may fail.  Bugs may
  remain undetected for years, and suddenly become activated.  Besides,
  software may age poorly, especially if changes somewhere else interfere
  with old working software.

  The operating environment may contain risks that undermine sound design,
  impementation, and operations.

  The notion that all critical concerns -- security, reliability, etc. --
  can be confined to a small portion of a computer system or distributed 
  system (e.g., a kernel) is a fantasy, particularly with conventionally
  designed systems.  

  The notion that distributed control solves problems that cannot easily be
  solved with central control is also often a myth -- problems of updating,
  synchronization, concurrency, backup, verifiability, etc., may be equally
  severe in many operating environments.

  Lowest-bidder efforts are intrinsically risky.  Commercial software is
  commonly far behind the state of the art.  That may be an advantage in
  some cases (!), but is often detrimental.  But there are significant
  benefits to be gained from using certain software engineering techniques.

  There are inherent risks in using computer systems in critical
  environments.  These must be continually reexamined.  Critical and open
  discussion of critical systems and critical environments is essential.
  We as technologists must better understand the risks and their implications.
  And we must apply that increased understanding to new developments.

And now, a word from our sponsor: This forum was established at the request
of the Association for Computing Machinery, and chartered as an activity of
the ACM Committee on Computers and Public Policy (of which I am the
chairman).  However, the opinions reflected herein do not constitute an
endorsement by the ACM.  On the other hand, if I screw up and do something
the ACM does not like, I probably lose my (volunteer) job.

As a summary of some of the problems that have occurred, and as a possible
inspiration for undiscussed areas of concern or areas of hope, I include in
this issue an update of the disaster list that those of you who have been
with us since the beginning saw in Vol 1 No 1.

    are known, but not publically acknowledged.]

---------------------- REFUTATION OF EARLIER REPORT --------------------------
* "Exocet missile not on expected-missile list, detected as friend" (SEN 8 3)
   [see Sheffield sinking, reported in New Scientist 97, p. 353, 2/10/83]; 
   Officially denied by British Minister of Defence Peter Blaker
   [New Scientist, vol 97, page 502, 24 Feb 83].  Rather, sinking abetted by
   defensive equipment being turned off to reduce communication interference?

SOSP 7 (SEN 5 1) and follow-on (SEN 7 1).]
