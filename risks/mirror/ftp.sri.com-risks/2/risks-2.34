As an example of how bureaucratic priorities can sometimes override known
safety considerations, it is worth noting that the Office of Mismanagement
and Bean-counting did suggest saving the cost of the Vandenberg shuttle
facility by launching north from KSC.  This idea was a non-starter for about
five different reasons, range safety not least.  It's amazing that it was
ever suggested, but it was -- quite seriously.

Apparently I confused a few people judging by the mail I've gotten...what I 
said about missiles launched at the Cape not flying over land applies ONLY TO 
MISSILES IN THE LAUNCH PHASE.  Obviously, satellites in orbit pass over a 
large part of the Earth's surface.  And as another contributor pointed out,
some test ranges routinely fly missiles over land; I was talking only about 
the Cape, which does not.

I think this discussion is reaching the point of diminishing returns from the 
RISKS viewpoint.  I will continue to answer detailed questions by personal 
mail, but let's move them out of RISKS.

Since when does a Ph.D in math, or even one in Computer Science, teach you
how to be a hacker (either kind)?

Most of the "Computer Burglars" I have come across were entirely self-taught.

       [I presume that is why Geoff titled it the way he did.  It is guys
        such as Armstrong who are headstrong -- except that their heads are
        in the sand.  They really believe it takes sophistication.  Readers
        of RISKS supposedly know better, although I have tried to be fairly 
        gentle in exposing gross security flaws in existing systems.  PGN]

  There was a story on the front page of the Washington Post on February
20th headlined "Maryland Computer Whiz Kid Faces Seven Theft Charges" and
subsubtitled "Credit Card Numbers Shared Electronically".  It described a 15
year old who got credit card numbers off a pirate CBBS and ordered computer
equipment over the phone to be sent to a vacant house.  Other than this, the
"whiz kid" did nothing at all remotely exceptional.
  It looks to me like the wave of computer hysteria still hasn't passed.
One of our Senators here in Virginia is introducing a bill to allow
unlimited government snooping into personal computer files on the grounds
that there might be data on child molestation (!) on the floppies.  Seems to
be an equally good case could be made on those grounds for warrantless
searches of personal papers, and any other violations of the Bill of Rights
I can think of.
  Computer security is the responsibility of system managers.  There is a
growing trend toward making microcomputers, often with no security systems
at all, available over phone lines.  Unknown phone numbers are NOT good
security.  Lots of kids dial numbers randomly searching for modem carriers.
  And there can be NO excuse for not having important data backed up.
To make frequent backups should be the first thing anyone learns about
computers.  And being able to easily and frequently save state is one
of the most important things any program should do.
