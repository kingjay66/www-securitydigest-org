 The RISKS Forum is a moderated digest.  Its USENET equivalent is comp.risks.
 Undigestifiers are available throughout the Internet, but not from RISKS.  

 SUBSCRIPTIONS: PLEASE read RISKS as a newsgroup (comp.risks or equivalent) on
 your system, if possible and convenient for you.  U.S. users on .mil or
 .gov domains should contact <risks-request@pica.army.mil> 
 (Dennis Rears <drears@pica.army.mil>).  UK subscribers please contact
 <Lindsay.Marshall@newcastle.ac.uk>.  Local redistribution services are 
 provided at many other sites as well.  Check FIRST with your local system or 
 netnews wizards.  If that does not work, THEN please send requests to 
 the automated <risks-request@csl.sri.com> list server, with first text line 
   SUBSCRIBE or UNSUBSCRIBE
 [with option of E-mail address if not the same as FROM: on the same line].
   INFO    
 gets you this file.
   HELP

 although not all are implemented for RISKS.

 CONTRIBUTIONS: to risks@csl.sri.com, with appropriate, substantive Subject:
 line, otherwise they may be ignored.  Must be relevant, sound, in good taste,
 objective, cogent, coherent, concise, nonrepetitious, and without caveats
 on distribution.  

 Diversity of content is welcome, but personal attacks are not.  PLEASE DO 
 NOT INCLUDE ENTIRE PREVIOUS MESSAGES in responses.  Contributions will not be

 **PLEASE** include your name & legitimate Internet FROM: address.
 Anonymized mail is not accepted.
 ALL CONTRIBUTIONS CONSIDERED AS PERSONAL COMMENTS; USUAL DISCLAIMERS APPLY.
 Particularly relevant contributions may be adapted for the RISKS sections
 of issues of ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes.

 * Submissions:  By submitting an item that is accepted for publication
 in RISKS, the author grants permission for unlimited public distribution 
 and redistribution in electronic or other form.

 * Reuse:  Blanket permission is hereby granted for reuse of all materials
 in RISKS, under the following conditions.  All redistributed items must

 As a courtesy, reusers of individual items (as opposed to forwardings of 
 entire issues) should notify the authors, and should pay particular 
 attention to any subsequent corrections.

 RISKS can also be read on the web at URL http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks

 RISKS ARCHIVES:  ftp://unix.sri.com/risks  if your browser accepts URLs, or
   ftp unix.sri.com<CR>login anonymous<CR>[YourNetAddress]<CR>
   cd risks<CR> or cwd risks<CR>, depending on your particular FTP;
 Issue J of volume 20 is in that directory: "get risks-20.J<CR>".  For issues
 of earlier volumes, "get I/risks-I.J<CR>" (where I=1 to 19, J always TWO 
 digits) for Vol I Issue j.  Vol I summaries in J=00, in both main directory
 and I subdirectory; "bye<CR>"  I and J are dummy variables here.  REMEMBER,
 Unix is case sensitive; file names are lower-case only.  <CR>=CarriageReturn;
 FTP.SRI.COM = [128.18.30.66]; FTPs may differ; Unix prompts for username and
 a password.  Search engines may find other mirrored sources, but those do
 not necessarily reflect occasional amendations.

 The ftp.sri.com site risks directory also contains the most recent PostScript
 copy of PGN's comprehensive historical summary of one liners:

 PRIVACY DIGESTS:

* The PRIVACY Forum is run by Lauren Weinstein.  It includes a digest (which
  he moderates quite selectively), archive, and other features, such as
  PRIVACY Forum Radio interviews.  It is somewhat akin to RISKS; it spans
  the full range of both technological and nontechnological privacy-related
  issues (with an emphasis on the former).  For information regarding the
  PRIVACY Forum, please send the exact line:
     information privacy
  as the BODY of a message to "privacy-request@vortex.com"; you will receive
  a response from an automated listserv system.  To submit contributions,
  send to "privacy@vortex.com". 

  PRIVACY Forum materials, including archive access/searching, additional
  information, and all other facets, are available on the Web via:
     http://www.vortex.com

* The Computer PRIVACY Digest (CPD) (formerly the Telecom Privacy digest) is
  run by Leonard P. Levine.  It is gatewayed to the USENET newsgroup
  comp.society.privacy.  It is a relatively open (i.e., less tightly moderated)
  forum, and was established to provide a forum for discussion on the
  effect of technology on privacy.  All too often technology is way ahead of
  the law and society as it presents us with new devices and applications.
  Technology can enhance and detract from privacy.  Submissions should go to
  comp-privacy@uwm.edu and administrative requests to
  comp-privacy-request@uwm.edu.
