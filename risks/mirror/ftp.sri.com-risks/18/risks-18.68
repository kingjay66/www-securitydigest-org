Subject: California tax-form attacks: a new tax on businesses

A California Franchise Tax Board computer apparently went berserk, resulting
in thousands of extra copies of 1996 tax forms being sent to California
businesses -- including a San Diego dentist who reportedly received about
16,000 copies of the 1996 forms.  [Source: An AP item in the *San Francisco
Chronicle*, 14 Dec 1996, A16.]

Subject: Communications errors delay response to San Francisco fire

>From Saturday's San Francisco Chronicle (Dec 14, page A20, also available
online: http://www.sfgate.com/wais/search/chron-pro.html):

San Francisco fire officials acknowledged yesterday that communications
errors delayed the arrival of vital equipment at last month's huge fire at
Pier 48 -- the second time this year that the department has had problems
getting firefighters to major blazes."  [...]  According to [Deputy Chief]
Gamble, a dispatcher -- alerted to the waterfront fire at 2:48 p.m. --
initially sent only four pieces of equipment by computerized message when he
should have sent seven. Gamble said the dispatcher mistakenly entered into
the computer that the alarm had come from a street box, triggering a
relatively minimal first response.  The second error occurred when the first
units at the scene immediately called for help. At that point, Gamble said,
the dispatcher told the computer to send the next wave -- only to discover
six minutes later that the units never got the message.  Gamble explained
that because the dispatcher gave the computer the wrong message on the first
alarm, the computer wouldn't accept the second."  [...]

  The RISK seems to be a user interface that makes it too easy to make
  mistakes entering data, and "business rules" that assume that whatever was
  previously entered into the computer is correct.

Response to query on laptop usage in PRC from a non-Sinologist

>From Frank Conlon <conlon@u.washington.edu>

With reference to Susan Blum's query, I cannot say anything at all about the
PRC, but will mention the strategy I followed whilst in India in 1990-91
using a laptop.

It may be too late or to unwieldy to use my approach, but what I did was buy
several extra storage batteries and a charger.  Except in Bombay city which
had a relatively stable power system, I never, that is NEVER, plugged my
computer directly into an electric source.  During my previous visit we had
purchased a top of the line, industrial strength surge protector made in the
U.S.A.  It lasted 6 days before the Delhi Electric Supply Undertaking sent a
spike through the line and blew the little hummer into the next world, if
there is a next world for surge protectors and transformers.

Instead, in 1990-91, since I had a computer that used batteries which could
be replaced and charged in a separate charging device, I just kept cycling
batteries through the charger and replacing them as needed.  Because I was
going to be there for almost a year, I purchased a substantial surge
protector in India--the sort folks there buy for their televisions and
refrigerators there.  Being manufactured in India meant that they were
engineered with a realistic grasp of the vagaries of most Indian power
supplies.  As the power surges came it buzzed and spat, but the battery
charger blissfully escaped unscathed.

Now if you are travelling around a lot, that might be inconvenient, and
perhaps such devices are not readily and cheaply available in China, but my
computer and data reached home safely, and the surge protector made a
handsome gift to one of the many folks who had done favors for me during my
stay.

Bon voyage, bon chance.

Subject: Re: repetitive strain injury suit (PGN, RISKS-18.68)

Repetitive Strain Injuries are a very common risk from computing; they can
easily lead to disabling injuries.  The fact that these people sustained
million dollar injuries give you an idea of how bad it can be...  However,
RSIs can be avoided with proper typing technique, ergonomics, stretching,
etc.  For instance, simpler than installing foot-pedals is to train oneself
to hit ctrl, shift, etc. with the index finger of the opposite hand.  For
tips about typing technique, and other information about RSIs, see
http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/RSI, which is pretty good (OK, as the author I'm
biased) although a bit Harvard specific.  Another good page (OK, maybe
better) is http://www.engr.unl.edu/eeshop/rsi.html.

Subject: November, 1996 CACM article on InfoWar Defense - highly critical

***** FLAME ON *****

Dateline: Livermore - Dec. 16 9:02AM

CACM AIMS RIGHT BUT MISSES INFO-WARFARE TARGET

Yes, Neil Munroe aimed right, but as usual, he missed the Info-Warfare target.

He correctly identifies the problem - disruption (a.k.a., corruption and
denial of services) - but he misses the target by talking about privacy,
privacy, and more privacy.

The phone system could be brought down... but we have to protect privacy
The power grid could go down... but we have to protect privacy
Planes could crash... but we have to protect privacy

Questions: Suppose we had absolute and perfect privacy but still had the
current inadequate level of information assurance.

	Could the phone system still be brought down? Yes
	Could the power grid still be brought down? Yes
	Could air traffic still be brought down? Yes
	Does privacy protection solve the information assurance problem? NO!

Question: Suppose we had absolute and perfect information assurance.

	Could we still have perfect privacy? Probably

So what is the relevance of the "... but we have to protect privacy" when
the issue is not privacy but assurance (integrity and availability)?

If we aim at information assurance and we keep hitting privacy, we will
never achieve our goal.

The target is NOT privacy!
This issue is NOT ABOUT PRIVACY!!
PRIVACY IS THE WRONG TARGET!!!

The right target is integrity and availability - a.k.a. information assurance.

How many times have I heard this misdirection? Hundreds at least. What's the
cause?  I don't know.

	It could be that people think of computers as infallible and that
	for that reason integrity and availability cannot be of concern.

	It could be that people just don't understand.

	It could be that the media attention and publicity is all aimed
	at privacy. I've even seen media stories of computer viruses causing
	computer crashes and heard the media people comment on how privacy
	problems have to be addressed in order to solve this.

Get a clue!

How come the editors at the ACM couldn't figure this one out and tell the
author to hit the right target?

	They must not have a clue!

How come the author calls the privacy advocates to find out about
information assurance?

	He must not have a clue!

How come the FBI seems to think they need to tap phones to protect NII
integrity?

	They certainly don't have a clue!

How come the president puts people without a clue in charge?

	The president doesn't have a clue either!

As clueless Louis once said:
	"If you want to make sure your phone works,
		make sure your number isn't in the yellow pages."

Subject: You can't rewrite history in Internet Explorer 3

Microsoft Internet Explorer 3 for Windows 95 maintains two special
folders. One, the 'Temporary Internet Files' folder, actually contains four
MS-DOS directories, used to cache HTML documents, GIFs, JPEGs and other
files downloaded from the Web. The other is the 'History' folder, which does
a similar caching task, but for URLs. Although each URL appears as a
separate entity in the folder they are actually stored in two .DAT files.

Clearing the History folder removes the entries visible in the Explorer
folder, but does not delete, or reinitialise the DAT files. These are still
visible using File Manager, and can be opened with a text editor to show all
the 'deleted' URLs. The files cannot be deleted by normal means including
first resetting attributes) from within File Manager or Explorer.
Presumably they are overwriten 'as needed' by new URLs.  Risks? We know
where you've been today...

Subject: When is an upgrade not an upgrade?

A few days ago a non-technical neighbour of mine asked me to pop over and
check out the new Pentium PC she had bought for her family and herself.  She
is not particularly familiar with computers and this was her first PC.  Her
main concern was that the computer dealer was going to "come back in a few
days" to upgrade the Pentium Chip from a 133Mhz to 166Mhz and she wanted to
make sure she wasn't wasting her time installing any new software if the
upgrade was going to trash her hard disk.

The new machine was running Microsoft Windows '95 and the dealer had
helpfully renamed the "My Computer" icon on the desktop to say "Pentium 133"
- presumably as part of their standard installation process.  Fair enough.

My neighbour told me the dealer had told her that the machine was "running
at 95 percent full power" and that he would return in a few days to "switch
it to 166Mhz".  She *knew* it had 16MB of memory because the machine counted
it as part of the boot-up process when the machine is switched on.

When the dealer's technical guy arrived (1 week later) he didn't have any
parts or boards with him and he proceeded to rename the "My Computer" icon
from "Pentium 133" to "Pentium 166".  He fiddled around with the CD ROM (my
neighbour had asked him to fix an unhealthy vibration).  I hadn't told the
technical guy that I was computer literate (I have my own software company)
and he - wrongly - assumed that my neighbour's lack of knowledge was typical
of all in the house.

The dealer's employee completed his inspection of the CD ROM and put on his
coat ready to go.  My neighbour's inquiries of "Is the PC running OK now?"
were answered with assurances that all the work was completed and he was
ready to leave - all this without once opening the PC case.

One assumes that either the dealer has been charging customers for Pentium
166 chipped PCs and installing the cheaper processors or the dealer's
employee has been up to no good himself.  Either way, my neighbour would
have been no wiser - as far as she would have been able to tell the upgrade
had been carried out as agreed.  Technology is so advanced in her opinion
that she thought it possible to upgrade the PC merely by sitting at the
keyboard and typing.  The processor inside the machine was actually a true
Intel Pentium 133 (I checked!) but it could have been a Pentium 90, Cyrix or
indeed just about anything else and a non-technical user would have had very
little obvious way of checking.

The risks?

Just because a PC says it has a Pentium 133 inside it doesn't actually mean
that it has.  Just because someone says with authority that everything is as
it should be it doesn't actually mean that it is.  And always get a second
opinion if you are about to spend a lot of money on something you don't
really understand.

Needless to say my neighbour (and her rather large and incensed husband)
took the PC back to the dealer and demanded her money back (which was
finally paid by cheque even though she paid cash).

Subject: Beware of Year2000 Sharks:  A Story for Non-Believers

BEWARE OF YEAR2000 SHARKS:  A STORY FOR NON-BELIEVERS

I offer the following story as a different slant on the effect Year2000 may
have on companies.  The Year2000 Shark may be after your customers too...

I was sitting in the waiting room of a tire-repair shop.  The room was
dingy, and the owner/manager behind the counter was covered in tire carbon
from head to foot.  Into this scene walked a well-dressed arrogant-looking
fellow with a meek assistant.  He walked up to the counter and assertively
asked the manager if he knew whether his credit-card authorization system
was Year2000-compliant. Needless to say, the manager was clueless.

The salesman offered to test the store's CC unit with a test card.  No
sooner had the manager given the slightest nod of agreement, the salesman
was swiping his card through the unit and pointing triumphantly at the
message that popped up saying the card was invalid.  "This card," he said,
"has an expiration date of January 30, 2000.  This system is not
Year2000-compliant.  May I ask where you got this system and how much you
paid for it..."

That manager was helplessly snowed by the circumstances.  If there was some
way for him to require that salesman to legitimize himself (and his test
card), it didn't occur to him.  I thought about stepping in, but wanted to
see where things went first.  The manager succeeded in fending off the
salesman's push for an immediate sale, so I figured he'd be OK.

THE MORAL: Even companies who have dealt with the Year2000 problem
effectively need to ensure that their customers do not fall prey to such
sharks or wily competitors who may seize the opportunity caused by the lack
of information. I'm not a marketing person, but I imagine marketing staffs
around the business world will be "strategizing" on this very soon, if they
haven't already started...

[It is] even harder to read on monitors with 80x8 pixel resolution, or 2x8
pixel resolution (Braille readers) or without a monitor at all (Speech

As far as I can see, the risks are monumental. From my viewpoint, a format
like HTML (which was designed to be accessible to everyone and every piece

photographs of each page in turn.

It may be simple for companies to produce .pdf documentation, but by doing

Subject: Re: .pdf files, RISKS of using Adobe Acrobat Reader (Ehrich, R-18.67)

I'm sure glad I don't use a user-hostile system like a Mac.  Instead, I use
a user-hostile IBM compatible.  My fun has been with Microsoft Visual FoxPro
5.0.

The Language Reference manual supposedly is a language reference manual, but
it isn't.  It has information on the syntax of the command, what the
arguments are, BUT LITTLE TO NOTHING ABOUT THE SEMANTICS.

Fortunately, that is available in the on-line documentation.  Needing a
language reference manual, you might want to print all of the on-line docs.
So you print it out.  (Cost?)  Then you find that the heading isn't printed.
With most of the commands, the syntax diagram just down from the top has the
item name, but with some retained for backward compatibility, they are only
documented with something like "This feature retained for backward
compatability.  Use <something else> instead." and nothing else.

Did you want to print the topics more than one at a time?  To do that, you
put the topics you want into the on-line docs notepad (where they are listed
in reverse order), print them (and find they print in reverse order (A nice
match!)), and then delete them from the notepad (ONE at a time).

Are you finding this confusing?  Try the on-line help for the on-line
documentation.  I got lost.  It's the worst on-line help I've ever read.

The RISK?  A customer (me) could refer to your manuals as "flingware" and
raise hell with technical support.  He might also switch to another product.
(If the product itself wasn't reasonable, I might have.)  VFP looks good,
but if you can't get it going...

Subject: Women into Computing Conference 1997, last call for papers

WOMEN INTO COMPUTING CONFERENCE 1997 IN ASSOCIATION 
WITH CENTRE FOR COMPUTING AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

To be held at De Montfort University, Milton Keynes, UK.
10th July - 12th July 1997

*** PAPER SUBMISSIONS DUE 6 January 1997 ***

PROGRESSION:   FROM WHERE TO WHAT?

Computing and information technologies are now ubiquitous and of vital
importance in the global society.  Gender related issues in computing
continue to be critical in realising the potential of these technologies.
Computing as a discipline has a clear gender imbalance.  Recent figures show
recruitment of women into the discipline is continuing to decline.

To date, significant determinants of women's success in the computing field
have been explored primarily in terms of societal, cultural and
organisational work factors.  The perspective of women computer
technologists and engineers has often been overlooked.  Tensions between the
different groups exist but there has been insufficient dialogue between
these different groups to date.  This conference will address this situation
and provide an opportunity for a greater understanding between all those
working in and associated with computing.

Papers are invited within the broad area of Gender related computing
research.  This includes but is not limited to:-

1.  Telematics -the field of computer mediated communication.
2.  Women systems/software engineers - a contradiction in terms?
3.  Professionalism, legislation and the role of women.
4.  Women Returners 
5.  'Man Machine' Interface to 'human Computer' Interface to what?
6.  Feminist perspectives in computing research.
7.  Education - computing education and the use of computers in education.

An underlying theme of the conference is to be social responsibility and
therefore we wish to encourage papers emphasising this and ethical issues.
Papers taking different cultural, national and societal aspects are
particularly welcome as are globally oriented papers.

In addition, we are looking for sister organisations throughout Europe to
participate in the conference.  The aim is to report on European Women's
Organisations, initiatives and relevant research.  We will be maximising
participation through the use of video conferencing services at De Montfort
University.

For further details, or if you would like to register an intention to submit
or participate in the conference, please email : wic97@dmu.ac.uk 
We will then add you to our mailing list for registration

Subject: Privacy Digests
 
Periodically I remind you of TWO useful digests related to privacy, both of
which are siphoning off some of the material that would otherwise appear in
RISKS, but which should be read by those of you vitally interested in
privacy problems.  RISKS will continue to carry general discussions in which
risks to privacy are a concern.

* The PRIVACY Forum is run by Lauren Weinstein, with some support from the 
  ACM Committee on Computers and Public Policy.  He manages it as a rather
  selectively moderated digest, somewhat akin to RISKS; it spans the full
  range of both technological and non-technological privacy-related issues
  (with an emphasis on the former).  For information regarding the PRIVACY
  Forum, please send the exact line:
 
     information privacy
 
  as the first text in the BODY of a message to:

     privacy-request@vortex.com

  You will receive a response from an automated listserv system.  To submit
  contributions, send to "privacy@vortex.com".
 
  Information and materials relating to the PRIVACY Forum may also be
  obtained from the PRIVACY Forum Archive via ftp to "ftp.vortex.com",
  gopher at "gopher.vortex.com", and World Wide Web via:
  "http://www.vortex.com".  Full keyword searching of the PRIVACY
  Forum Archive is available through the World Wide Web access address.

* The Computer PRIVACY Digest (CPD) (formerly the Telecom Privacy digest) is
  run by Leonard P. Levine.  It is gatewayed to the USENET newsgroup
  comp.society.privacy.  It is a relatively open (i.e., less tightly moderated)
  forum, and was established to provide a forum for discussion on the
  effect of technology on privacy.  All too often technology is way ahead of
  the law and society as it presents us with new devices and applications.
  Technology can enhance and detract from privacy.  Submissions should go to
  comp-privacy@uwm.edu and administrative requests to
  comp-privacy-request@uwm.edu.

There is clearly much potential for overlap between the two digests,
although contributions tend not to appear in both places.  If you are very
short of time and can scan only one, you might want to try the former.  If
you are interested in ongoing discussions, try the latter.  Otherwise, it
may well be appropriate for you to read both, depending on the strength of
your interests and time available.
