Subject: Maryland Lottery Computer Glitch

*The Washington Post* 13 Sep 1996 reports that a software error caused the
wrong lottery numbers to be distributed to the state's 3,800 outlets.  More
than 22,000 people successfully bet on one or more of the numbers, but threw
out their tickets thinking they lost.  Others mistakenly thought they had
won.  Getting one or two numbers right gets people $1-$5, although two
people bet numbers entitling them to $5000 in this six-state lottery.

The firm, which recently won the contract to run Maryland's lottery
games, stated that the numbers were correctly entered, but two of the
six numbers were altered in the transmission process.  A spokesman
said, "To the best of our knowledge, it was a software error."  The
Post noted that the firm recently lost its contract in Arizona due to
computer problems.

Evidently, one of the RISKS is getting bad press.

According to an interview with Margot Kidder in People Online, a computer 
virus was the last straw leading to her nervous breakdown. 

The virus (not identified) on her computer destroyed files, including the 
book she had been working for three years. Having, apparently, no backup 
copies, the entire work was lost. This loss triggered her widely reported

The primary network that serves Minnesota (the Minnesota Regional Network)

Minnesota ultimately get their connection to the rest of the world through
MR.Net.)  Following are the initial announcement that they had discovered

Subject: VeriSign's policy statement

I was looking at VeriSign's web page, in particular their Certification
Practice Statement (CPS).  <URL:https://www.verisign.com/repository/CPS>

Buried among the legal gobblygook, I found the following:

  "the certificate is being used exclusively for authorized and legal
purposes, consistent with this CPS," from Section 7.2.(v), Representations
by Subscriber Upon Acceptance,

and

  "By accepting a certificate, the subscriber assumes a duty to retain
control of the subscriber's private key, to use a trustworthy system, and to
take reasonable precautions to prevent its loss, disclosure, modification,
or unauthorized use." from Section 7.3, Subscriber Duty to Prevent Private
Key Disclosure.

I do not understand what Section 7.2 is supposed to mean.  Authorized by
whom? Legal according to which country's laws? Section 7.3's requirement "to
use a trustworthy system" would seem to eliminate about 99.5% of the market:
almost all computers are not trustworthy, even if they are (in practice)
trusted.

RISKS: Although you agree to all of this (and that you've read it) before
you receive your VeriSign certificate, it is not reasonable to expect people
to wade through a 13-chapter work.

If almost nobody meets the requirements for using VeriSign, what good is it?
Who accepts the risk of something going wrong, when the conditions for use
are not met, and VeriSign issued a certificate knowing that these conditions
are not met?  A false sense of security can be worse than no security....

Well, here's some anecdotal evidence. About 3 years ago, I was in seat 1D on
a Delta MD88 flying at cruise altitude over NE New Mexico on a clear summer
afternoon.  A flight attendant came out of the cockpit (fightdeck?) and with
a clear sense of urgency made a PA announcement to turn off all portable
electronic devices and instructed the other FAs to check all the passengers.
They quickly reported that the only device in use was a laptop in seat 2C
(right behind me) and this guy was having trouble saving his file so he
hadn't turned it off yet. The first FA said "I'm sorry sir, but you have to
turn it off NOW!" He did. She went back into the cockpit, and came out about
two minutes later. She went over to the guy in 2B, apologized, and said that
when the captain called her into the cockpit the first time (this is an
exact quote) "All the gauges were black." (The MD88 has a "glass" cockpit.)
She said that they were just now coming back on. She then said (I'm not
making this up) "The captain wants to know if you have a Compaq computer."
He said, with surprise, "Why, yes, it IS a Compaq." It was a older one with
an external mouse. I told them that I had read somewhere that external mice
greatly exacerbated the problem. I then had another cup of coffee.

It made a true believer out of me.

OK, let's be more blunt.

The Federal Aviation Administration has long been criticised for its dual
charter of both enforcing safety and encouraging the development of air
commerce.  The two roles are contradictory, representing an inherent
conflict of interest. This does not reflect upon the character of the many
skilled and motivated individuals that work there.  But the agency's
existence and function is based upon constraints that are often defined by
external parties, and the people that make up the FAA must work within those
constraints.  Just to make it clear, those constraints are "political," not
"scientific."

In the specific case you find "deplorable," actions taken to challenge the
operation of the ATR-72 in the US, the author makes credible points that
external influences--namely, the ramifications of a bilateral accord, in
which the US is obligated to accept the findings of the European
airworthiness authorities; economic events which had nothing to do with the
certification process; and French threats of reprisals against US
aircraft--were factors in the FAA's action (or inaction).

Faced with such heavy-duty forces, the author exploited media interest in
the October 1994 crash to point out what his concerns (as a pilot) were.  He
initially gave a public interview on a daytime talk show, and, eventually,
churned out the book. He states he did so out of concern for the safety of
the flying public.  It is arguable that the media attention influenced the
political climate.  No bureaucracy wants to be seen as fallible, and it is
equally arguable that ongoing pressure forced action on the issues.

I fail to see why this is unacceptable.  Particularly given the criteria
that you yourself have laid out, namely that it is an expert attempting to
manipulate the system in his favor.

If we lived in a science-fiction world in which some mysterious quantity
called Truth were feasible and easily obtained, then, yes, I suppose we
could live in a quasi-fascist society in which the anointed protect the
unwashed masses from the ambiguities of life.

However, we do not live in such a world.  In our world, issues often reflect
the vested interests of multiple parties, all of whom may be "in the right,"
but who may nonetheless have conflicting agendas.  There are many checks and
balances in such circumstances.  The government has competing agencies
(e.g., NTSB vs. FAA) to ensure that institutional cultures do not get out of
hand. The public can comment via its elected officials and the free press.
The victims' families can react via their lawyers. If information is
suppressed and kept in the province of "experts," the system stops working.

Creating star chambers is not the answer, particularly when it affects
operations in such a huge industry, in which MANY qualified individuals are
in credible positions to comment, and, especially, in a situation when SO
many peoples' lives can be put on the line.

I concede that investigation teams need room to work.  The NTSB freely
concedes that it must make periodic reports on the status of its
investigations.  It does not issue a probable cause statement until the
final report is issued.  However, your model implies that no discussion
whatsoever should take place until that final report is released.  That's
just unrealistic, in my opinion.  It is contrary to safety and even ignores
the interests of the affected parties--particularly the traveling public.

Subject: AT&T -- Lessons forgotten

Just got my brand new AT&T residential long-distance statement. Of course, I
pay "electronically". The quotes mean that I do it through my fancy computer
with Internet connectivity. And then the check gets printed out on wood
pulp, physically hauled in a mail sack to AT&T's post office box, removed
from the envelope, and then some clerk (automated?) keys it in and credits
it to my account.

As error-prone as this process is, it sort of worked since the account number 
had a check digit which gave some hope of correctly crediting the account. My 
new account number no longer has the additional digits which, I'd assumed, 
were a combination of unique code and check digit. Now a single slip of a 
keystroke and my check gets credit to another's phone bill. But at least, the 
new bill is pretty with an Olympic logo and AT&T's corporate logo. Who cares 
about the data.

To be honest, it isn't clear that companies really used the check
information anyway. The attitude, as with credit card companies, seems to be
deposit and, if someone complains, and verifies by showing the back of a
physical check (which banks try to not provide any more), you might convince
them that you really paid and they just miscredited it.

One day, in the far far future, there may be a course in "data integrity" as
part of the accounting or MIS curriculum Until them, may your checks find
the right home more often than not.

Subject:  Word for Windows risks, continued

In RISKS-18.44, Edward Reid explains how Word saves files.  But it's worse
than what he describes.  I'm working on a Word 6 document (under Windows
3.1), trying to excise some references to obsolete terms.  I searched for
and deleted all of the references, and did a "Save As" to ensure that I'm
creating a new file without any "leftovers" from earlier versions.  Doing a
search doesn't find any references to the deleted terms, but the "Find File"
option (and utilities such as Norton Desktop's SuperFind) still locate the
supposedly deleted text.  So I presume they're somewhere in the file, which
gives me very little confidence in the safety of handing someone a Word
file.

The difference between this and previous discussions of the topic (I
believe) are that others have indicated that doing a "Save As" or disabling
the "Fast Save" option would avoid this behavior.  That's clearly not the
case, for at least some versions of Word.

Subject: Re: Microsoft VC++ property pages guaranteed to crash first time

Aside from the gratuitous insults, the below RISKS posting is also factually
incorrect in a number of places.

The resource modification done below is *NOT* a modification to the file on
the disk. It is done via a copy-on-write mechanism. The page containing the
modified resource is written out to the paging file, not back to the
original image. So there is no difference in the exe and whatever you ship
to production IS THE SAME AS THE ONE THAT WAS TESTED.

Writing to a read-only resource does not cause a crash for the customer.
The default unhandled exception filter for any Win32 application handles
access violations caused by writing to a resource by changing the protection
on the page from read-only (the default for resource sections) to
copy-on-write and restarts the instruction. It will now succeed, but the
modified page is written to the paging file instead of back to the original
image. For more gory details, see KB article Q126630 "Resource sections are
read-only" at http://www.microsoft.com/kb/developr/win32dk/q126630.htm

There are two reasons this behavior will cause you pain. You will see a
first-chance exception if you are running under a debugger and have the
debugger configured to handle first-chance exceptions for access violations.
If you don't understand the difference between first-chance exceptions
(exception filter functions have not executed) and second-chance exceptions
this can be confusing.
http://www.microsoft.com/kb/developr/win32dk/q105675.htm should help you out
here.

Second, if your code has a filter function that handles this exception
before the top-level exception filter sees it, the right thing is not going
to happen. This is a RISK you always take when your exception filter handles
exceptions it doesn't know how to handle.

Subject: Re: Microsoft VC++ property pages guaranteed to crash first time

Microsquish Stealth Bug Insertion Technology

While I'm kind of dismayed by the "if you can't innovate, litigate"
philosophy so often applied to Microsoft, this is a particularly lethal
little gem from their MFC team.  In many development environments, this
problem will almost certainly guarantee that your app will crash the first
time it is executed on customer machines, but the crash will only happen
once, and will mystify tech support.

The problem arises in the use of property pages, otherwise known as tabbed
notebook dialogs, as they are designed and implemented in the Visual C++/MFC
environment.  VC allows the developer to use interactive resource editors to
design the property pages, but IT ONLY DOES THE FINAL STEP OF THE PROCESS IN
EXECUTING THE APPLICATION, not in the development cycle.  This step, where
the style of the page is changed in the resource will cause most machines to
abort the software as it is attempting to change a read only resource.

What really concerns me from a risks perspective is that the traditional
development model is to release an exe to the test/qa group, and then to
ship this exe to production when it receives a blessing from test/qa.  This
means that the exe shipped to production IS NOT THE SAME AS THE ONE THAT WAS
TESTED, because the tested exe has been executed, and the one sent to
production has not.  Hence, every customer who launches the app for the
first time will be rewarded with a crash, which can never be reproduced.

Yes, you can get around it with careful use of filtered exceptions.  The
problem is that this is rather insidious, and outside the realm of thinking
of most developers, who view an exe as the final product of the development
process.  In this case, the final product is an executed exe.

Personally, I feel this is a lot like the Monty Python "Frog chocolates"
sketch.  VC too should have a great big warning sticker on it saying "An EXE
from the linker is NOT A PRODUCT.  YOU MUST EXECUTE IT TO MAKE A PRODUCT."

 -- -- -- -- -- -- ORIGINAL MICROSOFT DOCUMENTATION    -- -- -- -- -- -- 
Applies to class CPropertyPage, specifically the DoModal function that
causes the page to be presented on the screen.

virtual int DoModal( );
  
  [... standard usage documentation deleted...]
  [HERE IS THE INTERESTING BIT!!!]

Note.  The first time a property page is created from its corresponding
dialog resource, it may cause a first-chance exception. This is a result of
the property page changing the style of the dialog resource to the required
style prior to creating the page. Because resources are generally read-only,
this causes an exception. The exception is handled by the system, and a copy
of the modified resource is made automatically by the system. The
first-chance exception can thus be ignored.  Since this exception must be
handled by the operating system, do not wrap calls to
CPropertySheet::DoModal with a C++ try/catch block in which the catch
handles all exceptions, for example, catch (...). This will handle the
exception intended for the operating system, causing unpredictable behavior.
Using C++ exception handling with specific exception types or using
structured exception handling where the Access Violation exception is passed
through to the operating system is safe, however.

The system could have been configured so that it would have been difficult

Windows 95 security may not be its best aspect, but even a certified secure
product is only secure with respect to its security claims and only then
under certain conditions - eg, the procedures in the accompanying Trusted

However there's an interesting interaction between US and UK laws here. We

any computer without proper authorisation. If I declare that unsolicited

anyone sending such mail to me is committing a criminal offence.

If we can enact a junk fax act on the basis of direct cost, we can

Subject: Re: Sometimes junk e-mail is already a fax (Franklin, RISKS-18.45)

Having tried to quash this theory repeatedly, I'm discouraged to see it
re-emerge yet again in RISKS.  The fact is that courts are not going to read
TCPA as applying to junk e-mail.  Most of the reasons are set out in the
NetGuide article whose URL I gave in my previous message.  I won't repeat
those arguments here, but here are two I didn't have room for in print:

1) Section 227(d)(1)(B) of Title 47 makes it illegal 

  to use a computer or other electronic device to send any message via a
  telephone facsimile machine unless such person clearly marks, in a
  margin at the top or bottom of each transmitted page of the message or
  on the first page of the transmission, the date and time it is sent
  and an identification of the business, other entity, or individual
  sending the message and the telephone number of the sending machine
  or of such business, other entity, or individual.  

Note this section applies to noncommercial messages as well as
commercial ones.

If a computer equipped as described by Dan Franklin were really a TFM for
purposes of the TCPA, then almost every Usenet post (and a vast amount of
e-mail) would be illegal, since it is highly unusual for senders to put
their telephone numbers in the headers.  (I leave aside entirely the problem
of what a "page" is in an e-mail message, other than to observe that this is
further evidence that Congress had only conventional faxes in mind.)

BTW, it is not an adequate response to say "oh, but 'telephone number' here
just means your correct e-mail address."  If you're not willing to read
"telephone number" literally, why on earth should anyone adopt a
hyperliteral reading of the definition of a TFM in sec. 227(a)?

2) Suppose someone in your company sends e-mail to the two dozen people in
his/her working group advertising a bake sale or yard sale.  Assume further
that a single recipient reads this e-mail on a networked PC equipped with a
modem and printer.  Under the proposed broad reading of the TCPA, this would
be illegal.  Is that what Congress intended?  (The legislative history
certainly doesn't offer any support for it.)

FWIW, there are no cases addressing this question of whether junk e-mail is
covered by the TCPA.  Frankly, I think the issue will be moot before very
long; this is too hot (and vote-getting) an issue to be ignored by Congress,
which has been more than willing to legislate rules for the Internet this
year.
