Subject: L-vis Lives in Virtual TV

L-Vis (Live Video Insertion System) allows arbitrary images to be
superimposed on television pictures (for example, for advertising purposes)
but without those images appearing to live audiences or on instant replays.
The Princeton Video Image system "uses missile guidance technology and a
customized computer" to insert electronic billboards in the viewer-perceived
program.  The computer system recognizes familiar patterns (such as the wall
behind home plate in a baseball stadium) and automagically inserts the
desired logo or other graphic in the specified location.  The image is
logically removed whenever it would in the real world be physically obscured
from camera view (e.g., by a batter or umpire).  [Source: *San Francisco
Chronicle*, 6 Jun 1996, p. A1 and A13.]

Subliminal advertising was tried in movies back in the 1950s.  This is
perhaps more insidious, because you can no longer tell what is real and what
is virtual.  Added icons of virtual victuals depicting the sponsor's
products all over the ball park -- perhaps even on the pitched balls, with
adjustments for spin?  The label on the Cincinnati Reds' owner's favorite
beverage transformed into the sponsor's label, or Schottzie overlayed as a
pit bull?  Think how the TV producers could alter Chicago Bulls' Dennis
Rodman's appearance (pet bull?), dynamically color coordinating to adapt to
the arena surroundings.  Signs visible to the live audience (such as "Smoke
El Hempos") could be transformed appropriately (e.g., "DON'T Smoke El
Hempos") for the TV audience, to satisfy an emerging FCC broadcast
regulation against tobacco.  L-vis has absolutely glorious RISKS-related
possibilities, such as when the pattern recognizer indentifies something
that unexpectedly happens to match the given rules.  A contradictory message
might get added to the sponsor's message, or an obscenity might emerge as an
inadvertent juxtaposition of symbols.  Stay tuned for more excitement
appearing in RISKS on this one!  PGN

Subject: Another Java attack

There is another serious security bug in the class loading code for all
currently available Java browsers:

    Netscape up to versions 2.02 and 3.0beta4 (except Windows 3.x)
    Oracle PowerBrowser for Win32
    HotJava 1.0beta
    'appletviewer' from the Java Development Kit up to version 1.0.2

Sun, Netscape, and Oracle have been sent details of the problem (which is
partly related to the ClassLoader attack found by Drew Dean, et al. in
March).  The attack works by exploiting a design flaw in the mechanism that
separates JVM classes into different namespaces.

Using this bug, an attacker can bypass all of Java's security restrictions.
This includes reading and writing files, and executing native code on the
client with the same permissions as the user of the browser.

The only way to avoid this problem at the moment is to disable Java. For
more details see
    http://ferret.lmh.ox.ac.uk/~david/java/bugs/

Technical details will be posted when Sun, Netscape, and Oracle release 
patches.

Subject: Another Java attack

David Hopwood, a Java researcher in the UK, has uncovered a new security bug
in Java [RISKS-18.18].  In simple terms, he has been able to manipulate the
way objects are assigned and the way they collaborate, in order to undermine
the applet security manager.
  
Hopwood contacted JavaSoft directly re: the bug, and we have had a team
working on a fix for the past 72 hours.  In addition, we are applying
Hopwood's model to conduct a security review, to determine if there are
other bugs that may apply.

We are currently thoroughly testing the fix, and plan to release a patch as
soon as possible.  As we complete more testing of the fix, a more detailed
description of the bug and the fix will be added to the JavaSoft security
FAQ at http://java.sun.com/sfaq/.

JavaSoft is grateful for the internet security community's active interest
in reviewing our code and we welcome feedback that makes Java better
technology.

From: ig25@fg70.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de (Thomas Koenig)
Subject: FORTRAN and heat exchangers

This is an old hat, but it still keeps coming up.

A co - worker of mine was doing experiments on a heat exchanger; he was also
modelling it with a FORTRAN (77) program that ran on a PC.

One dimensionless quantity used in heat-exchanger theory is the Nusselt
number, defined as

   Nu = alpha * l / lambda

(alpha is the heat transfer coefficient, l a characteristic length, and
lambda the thermal conductivity).

The name of the variable he chose was NU; he did not declare this variable,
so the FORTRAN compiler implicitly typed it as an integer.  Since the range
of NU was between 10 and 200, this introduced a maximum error of 10% to 0.5%
in his calculations - small enough not to be noticed immediately.  I don't
want to make a bet on how many commercial heat-exchanger design codes make
the same error.

Related is the "5/9" problem (this expression silently evaluates to
0 in FORTRAN and C), which often bugs translations of formulas by
hand into FORTRAN, which makes a**(5/9) equal to 1.

Some tools (notably ftnchek for FORTRAN 77) recognize this, and issue
a warning.  Unfortunately, these tools are not in wide use in the
scientific community.

  Faulty computer blamed in Ariane rocket failure
  
     Experts studying the moments before the Ariane-5 rocket explosion
     say faulty computer software may be to blame for the rocket veering
     off course. Apparently, the rocket was misfed information that made
     it think it was not following the right path. The rocket then
     changed direction, causing the upper part to began to break apart.

Subject: The European Space Agency's little problem

After the European Space Agency's little problem this week and the reports
now filtering out that is was 'a computer error', it sounds more like a
sensor fault or a wiring fault.  (Apparently, the computer tried to correct
for what it thought was a disturbance to its trajectory and then set the
thrusters full over - one big disturbance or was it positive feedback).

Anyway, the ground controls hit the 'explode' button.

Why O why didn't the payload have a chute. After all it must have had
separator blasts. The 'abort and blow up' sequence could have consisted of a
'separate and chute' the payload stage followed by blow up the rest.

Didn't the early Apollo missions do this, or some other satellite launchers.

Is this complacency at work here.

What a risk - millions of (pounds, dollars, whatever - big in anyone's
currency) and all that work.

Subject: Ariane Explosion - Positive Aspects

On 4 June 1996 the Ariane 5 prototype European space launcher veered off
course and was destroyed by its controllers 40 seconds after blast-off
(details from *The Guardian*, UK 5th June 1996). The launcher development
had cost UKP5bn (pounds sterling) and the explosion destroyed a UKP500M
four-satellite experiment to monitor the sun, and as the headline
says..."And It Wasn't Insured".

Leaving consideration of what went wrong until details emerge, it is worth
noting aspects that were successful or at least were not as poorly managed
as may appear. Firstly, there was no loss of life - the safety precautions
for destruction by ground control worked as planned (the TV pictures showed
the destruction happened within seconds of the off-course problems becoming
visible, suggesting that either data had already indicated problems or that
the controllers were remarkably responsive at pressing a pretty expensive
button). Secondly, the European Space Agency is in a risk taking business,
and the price of risk taking is occasional failure - Ariane 5 is the follow
on to existing Ariane rockets that bring the agency's commercial arm UKP666M
per year, with a waiting list valued at nearly UKP3.3bn. Thirdly, regarding
the financial losses, it is nigh on impossible to obtain insurance for test
flights, and the cargo was being flown for free (the scientists responsible
for the experiments didn't have the budget for a paying flight, so took the
risk of a prototype launch).

It is certain that there will be lessons from the investigation, but it is 
worth noting that, but for some risk management at the high level, it could 
have been much worse and that risks were recognised by the participants, 
even if not adequately protected against.

Subject: RAL loses satellite cluster to Ariane Five

Although the uninsured satellite was carried on a free flight with known
risks that it wouldn't work right first time, I think we now know that
there's no such thing as a free launch.

Personally I think they should bring back Blue Streak.

Actually, as readers of the Airbus thread will know, I have a bias in favour
of the European aircraft industry - whether I would travel in a capsule on
Ariane Five is another matter, but I remember the quote about what either
John Glenn or Alan Shepherd thought about when waiting to launch ("the
rocket contains 5 million parts, all made by the lowest bidder" ,
approximately) so I suppose launch vehicles will inevitably be either
unreliable, or Bad Value For Money - so make sure your satellites are all
reproducible by CAD/CAM. And perhaps there should be a few more CASE and
automatic testing systems around?.

So for a change the risk is, there might not be enough computerisation?

Although I sign this stating where I work, this is very definitely my
personal opinion, not RAL's!!!, however the destruction of the rocket when
it went off course and tried to attack French Guiana made the national news
here: I don't think my bad publicity will equal what Ariane has had from the
press. The satellite design computer was attacked by organised hackers via
Sweden a month or so ago - perhaps this was an indication of how the Eastern
Bloc intends to prop up its launcher industry?. In any case, it's worth
bearing in mind that this sort of"navigation error" could easily creep in if
a virus or a hacker gets onto the development computers. Computer security
that's worth money isn't only confined to banks.

Subject: Accidental shooting down of F-15 revisited (Re: RISKS-17.56)

Some of the readers of RISKS will recall that I reported an accidental
shooting down of an F-15 fighter plane by another F-15 during interception
training of the Japanese air force last December.

To refresh your memory, what happened was that 
 - Two F-15 airplanes took place in an interception training.
 - One of the planes carried live missiles.
   The reason given was that the airplanes were routinely engaged in
   REAL interception missions and taking missiles off takes time.
   (BAD decision: They ought to have unload the live missiles in
    the first place.)
 - The main fire unit was supposed to be off (by turning off main switch).
 - However, somehow, it got turned on. (static electricity problem?)
 - Despite the visual cue on the main firing display console,
   which showed that the main firing system was ON and live,
   the pilot triggered the firing button, and launched a sidewinder
   missile against another F-15.
 - The F-15 was hit and destroyed. The pilot escaped by parachute. 

The defense agency released its investigation report on the the
accident.  (I think it was released last week.)  Some newspapers had
articles following the release of the report, but they are all
sketchy. My conclusion after reading articles is this.

  - Yes, indeed, the main firing system was turned on. But, they could 
    not determine the cause of the malfunction(!).

  - The report seemed to imply that the visual cue on the firing
    console ought to have alerted the pilot that the system was live
    and that the pilot should have taken notice and refrained from
    triggering the missile.
   (I think Japanese pilots have less live missile traing than, say,
    U.S., or Israel pilots, and so pilots may have tough time figuring 
    out what the real operating modes are from complex computer
    display alone. Well, this is the reason they need training in the
    first place anyway, though.)

  - (To my disbelief) It was suggested some type of plastic cap be
    placed on the main trigger during future training missions to
    prevent pilots from triggering(!?).
  
Frankly speaking, I was pretty much dismayed at the depth of of the
investigation.  It didn't really go to the bottom of the malfunction.

The same hardware/software problem might persist in other F-15s in Japan.
(It was not clear whether same type of problems are ever reported before in
the U.S.A.. My understanding is that F-15s used in Japan are licensed and
manufactured in Japanese factories. But computer firing systems are often
brought in as is from U.S.A. as black boxes.)

The last low-tech solution to the prevention of triggering the missile 
was almost comical. 

Some conspiracy theorists could argue that the air force might want to hide
some mistakes during the manufacturing of Japanese version of F-15 by
shifting blame on the pilot. But I digress..

Now that the Japanese naval boat shot down a U.S. airplane off Hawaii,
I am interested how far the investigation of *THIS* accident goes and
what way. I hope they nail down the cause this time around.

The newspaper involved is the Collegiate Times, the student run paper of
Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.  In an article on page
A6 of the April 30th edition, the paper ran an article about seven students
who were accepted into the Governor's Fellows Program.  In the center of the
article was a featured quote from Sharon Yeagle, an assistant to the vice
president of student affairs.

Unfortunately for the newspaper, the template used for the layout 
contained a "humorous" title meant to be replaced.  Somehow the quote and 
quotee were filled in but her title was never entered and the 
placeholder, "Director of Butt Licking" was published instead.

And this is not the first time this has happened.  According to the 
article in the Roanoke Times, in the Oct. 27th issue the phrase also 
appeared.  However, that time an accurate quote was attributed to a false 
name and a false title.

The risks?  If you're going to have a generic template, make it generic.  
And if something bad happens once, it's going to happen again so fix it 
after the first occurrence.  Personally, when I'm writing and need to 
leave something to be completed later I always enter in a string of at 
least five question marks.   It has become second nature for me to search 
for that string before "committing" my writing.  And when I've forgotten, 
it has resulted in some confusion but fortunately no lawsuits.

Subject: Pornography and throughput?

In RISKS-18.15, Bob Morrell takes an assertion (cited from RISKS-18.13) that
a particular ISP would triple its throughput if it accepted alt.binaries and
parlays that into a claim that the Internet is mainly about pornography.
Occam's Razor suggests a more general explanation: Images contain much more
information than text, regardless of content.

Here is an example.  I am writing a book.  A picture will fill the front
cover; a smaller picture will appear on the back cover.  The publisher sent
me a JPEG file representing the front cover; that file is 252,368 bytes.
The file with the back-cover picture is 54,070 bytes.  Total: slightly more
than 306,000 bytes.

The entire text of the book (400 pages) is just under 695,000 bytes
[that is, excluding the covers].

In this case, a picture is worth much more than a thousand words.

I have in the past done computer security work for several large banking
institutions which everyone has heard of.  In my opinion, with respect to
the business case of choosing to pay blackmail or fix the problem, it is
cheaper to make a few blackmail payments than to protect an entire
multinational (or even single-nation) banking organization with strong
information security (cryptography, of course).  This is probably true even
with five "cyber terrorist" organizations operating, but this obviously does
not scale well.

This is, of course, disappointing (especially speaking as someone who might
attempt to make all that money legitimately designing security systems).
However, I don't find it surprising at all.  One blackmail payment of this
level approximates the daily operating expenses of one of these
organizations.  Consider this loss alone, ignoring the lost profits and
public relations nightmare, and you might pay the blackmail, too.

What these banks are surely not considering is that there are many other
advantages to strong information security.  Some bans are considering this,
but not quickly enough, IMHO.

I've believed for a long time that the people who need security most won't
do anything until they personally feel some intense pain.  (This is
analogous to the multitude of people who didn't believe in regular backups
until one of their disks crashed.)  If there was another Barings which
folded due to inadequate security instead of financial mismanagement, maybe
then the banking industry would do something real, and stop complaining at
how painful security was.  An ounce of prevention, and all that.
