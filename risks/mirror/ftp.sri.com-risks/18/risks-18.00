Subject: Info on RISKS (comp.risks), contributions, subscriptions, FTP, etc.  

 The RISKS Forum is a moderated digest.  Its USENET equivalent is comp.risks.
 Undigestifiers are available throughout the Internet, but not from RISKS.  

 SUBSCRIPTIONS: PLEASE read RISKS as a newsgroup (comp.risks or equivalent) on
 your system, if possible and convenient for you.  BITNET folks may use their
 LISTSERV (e.g., LISTSERV@UGA): SUBSCRIBE RISKS or UNSUBSCRIBE RISKS.  U.S.
 users on .mil or .gov domains should contact <risks-request@pica.army.mil> 
 (Dennis Rears <drears@pica.army.mil>).  UK subscribers please contact 
 <Lindsay.Marshall@newcastle.ac.uk>.  Local redistribution services are 
 provided at many other sites as well.  Check FIRST with your local system or 
 netnews wizards.  If that does not work, THEN please send requests to 
 the newly automated <risks-request@csl.sri.com>, with first text line 
   SUBSCRIBE or UNSUBSCRIBE
 [with option of E-mail address if not the same as FROM: on the same line].
   INFO    
 gets you this file.
   HELP
 gives instructions on using the Majordomo listserver in other ways,
 although not all are yet implemented for RISKS.

 CONTRIBUTIONS: to risks@csl.sri.com, with appropriate, substantive Subject:
 line, otherwise they may be ignored.  Must be relevant, sound, in good taste,
 objective, cogent, coherent, concise, nonrepetitious, and without caveats
 on distribution.  

 Diversity of content is welcome, but not personal attacks.  PLEASE DO 
 NOT INCLUDE ENTIRE PREVIOUS MESSAGES in responses.  Contributions will not be
 ACKed; the load is too great; if you feel neglected, send a follow-up message.
 **PLEASE** include your name & legitimate Internet FROM: address,
 especially from .UUCP and .BITNET folks.  Anonymized mail is not accepted.
 ALL CONTRIBUTIONS CONSIDERED AS PERSONAL COMMENTS; USUAL DISCLAIMERS APPLY.
 Particularly relevant contributions may be adapted for the RISKS sections
 of issues of ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes or SIGSAC Review.

 * Submissions:  By submitting an item that is accepted for publication
 in RISKS, the author grants permission for unlimited public distribution 
 and redistribution in electronic or other form.

 * Reuse:  Blanket permission is hereby granted for reuse of all materials
 in RISKS, under the following conditions.  All redistributed items must
 include the Risks-Forum masthead line.  All reuse must be accompanied by 
 the following statement:
     Reused without explicit authorization under blanket permission
     granted for all Risks-Forum Digest materials.  The author(s), the 
     RISKS moderator, and the ACM have no connection with this reuse.
 As a courtesy, reusers of individual items (as opposed to forwardings of 
 entire issues) should notify the authors, and should pay particular 
 attention to any subsequent corrections.

 RISKS can also be read on the web at URL http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks

 RISKS ARCHIVES:  ftp://unix.sri.com/risks  if your browser accepts URLs, or
   ftp unix.sri.com<CR>login anonymous<CR>[YourNetAddress]<CR>
   cd risks<CR> or cwd risks<CR>, depending on your particular FTP;
 Issue J of volume 19 is in that directory: "get risks-19.J<CR>".  For issues
 of earlier volumes, "get I/risks-I.J<CR>" (where I=1 to 18, J always TWO 
 digits) for Vol I Issue j.  Vol I summaries in J=00, in both main directory
 and I subdirectory; "bye<CR>"  I and J are dummy variables here.  REMEMBER,
 Unix is case sensitive; file names are lower-case only.  <CR>=CarriageReturn;
 FTP.SRI.COM = [128.18.30.66]; FTPs may differ; Unix prompts for username and
 password.  Also ftp bitftp@pucc.Princeton.EDU.  WAIS repository exists at
 server.wais.com [192.216.46.98], with DB=RISK (E-mail info@wais.com for info)

 PRIVACY DIGESTS:
 
* The PRIVACY Forum is run by Lauren Weinstein, with some support from the 
  ACM Committee on Computers and Public Policy.  He manages it as a rather
  selectively moderated digest, somewhat akin to RISKS; it spans the full
  range of both technological and non-technological privacy-related issues
  (with an emphasis on the former).  For information regarding the PRIVACY
  Forum, please send the exact line:
 
     information privacy
 
  as the first text in the BODY of a message to:

     privacy-request@vortex.com

  You will receive a response from an automated listserv system.  To submit
  contributions, send to "privacy@vortex.com".
 
  Information and materials relating to the PRIVACY Forum may also be
  obtained from the PRIVACY Forum Archive via ftp to "ftp.vortex.com",
  gopher at "gopher.vortex.com", and World Wide Web via:
  "http://www.vortex.com".  Full keyword searching of the PRIVACY
  Forum Archive is available through the World Wide Web access address.

* The Computer PRIVACY Digest (CPD) (formerly the Telecom Privacy digest) is
  run by Leonard P. Levine.  It is gatewayed to the USENET newsgroup
  comp.society.privacy.  It is a relatively open (i.e., less tightly moderated)
  forum, and was established to provide a forum for discussion on the
  effect of technology on privacy.  All too often technology is way ahead of
  the law and society as it presents us with new devices and applications.
  Technology can enhance and detract from privacy.  Submissions should go to
  comp-privacy@uwm.edu and administrative requests to
  comp-privacy-request@uwm.edu.
