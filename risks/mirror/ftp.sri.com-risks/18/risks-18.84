Subject: Highly classified files copied by Croat teens?

Dave Farber <farber@cis.upenn.edu> noted a 19 Feb 1997 Reuter report from
Zagreb indicating that 3 Croatian teenagers apparently broke Pentagon
protection codes on the Internet and copied classified files from the
Anderson nuclear installation and an unnamed satellite research center.
``The damage caused by the teenagers' destruction of high-profile protection
programs could reach half a million dollars,'' according to the Zagreb
daily, *Vecernji List*.  The three youths attend a special Zadar
math-science school.  ``Principal Zdravko Curko said the three had no
criminal intent and their `success' was a compliment to their education.''
[PGN Abstracting]

Might we suspect that the files were actually unclassified, that the $.5M is
overblown, and that the breakins did not require much high-tech attacks?

Accidental Year 2096 in e-mail message crashes Navigator w/ Win 95 

The following was posted to two HTML related mail lists. The individual had
his computer date accidentally set to 2096.  Any mail that he sent or posted
to a news group would crash the reader's computer if they were running
Netscape Navigator Mail under Windows 95. The entire content, with headers,
is supplied below.

Subject: Sorry if you crashed (W95 FYI: Chaos in 2038!)

It was brought to my attention that my posts to these lists have caused
Netscape Mail running on Win95 to crash.  I tried to test this by sending
myself a message but was unable to run NS Mail at all.

I'm glad to say I found the problem: In the course of a HD upgrade my system
clock had somehow built a 100-year bridge to the 21st century and was set to
2096. Subsequent testing shows that dates beyond 2038 cause many unwanted
side effects in Win95, including the aforementioned crashes when NS Mail
receives a message so dated.

Having returned to the present, I retrieved my previously sent test message
dated 2096, and, sure enough, NS Mail crashed.

Sorry if anyone experienced this problem. It was not intentional.

(Also sorry that I rewrote/resent a 'transparent text' post on www-style. I
thought one of these crashes had trashed the message.)

Subject: Year 2K and my VCR...

As one of the few people who actually PROGRAMS his VCR, it came as a shock
to me the realization that this piece of electronics (roughly two years old)
will fail in the year 2000.  One wonders how prevalent this problem is, in
embedded systems shipping today.  And I doubt there will be a bug fix for my
VCR.

Subject: Downloading UPS-captured Signatures

From a UPS ad in the Feb 1997 Wired:

  Once a signature is captured and downloaded to our mainframe, you can use
  UPS OnLine Tracking Software to view it. You can even print it. To get the
  software, just call 1-800-XXX-XXXX or visit our web site at www.ups.com.

Sure, we've all known about the capturing ever since UPS started doing it,
but now malicious users can add this to their toolbag. The more things
change the more they stay the same.

Subject: Re: Myths about digital signatures (Felten, RISKS-18.83)

   * Myth 2: If X has signed a program, and I trust X, then it is safe for me
   to download the program.  [...]

Ed, It's even worse than what you described.  Even if X has carefully
managed his cryptographic keys, and X's security hasn't been penetrated, X
might not have designed the component carefully, or have executed a
competent implementation of that design.

For example, if an Active X component has a loophole where (with the right
document) said component can be induced to interpret and execute arbitrary
Visual Basic statements, even if the signer was honest, and legitimate, and
properly went through all of the Microsoft certification procedures, it
still might be possible to exploit a security bug in the Active X component.
The Java security model at least *thinks* about this issue, where as the
Active X approach completely punts about this concern.

So this is a double-edged RISK, combining the RISK of people not
understanding what the digital signature means, and the RISK of more and
more complex applications with powerful macro facilities being used in
interesting ways (the prime example being the Word concept virus; the
demarkation between code and data can get awfully blurry!).

Both of these RISKS aren't new ones, but when combined with the web and the
automatic downloading of Active X components, the potential for problems
caused by this combined set of RISKS is quite scary and sobering.

I appreciate your insightful opinion on this matter, however...
	Anyone can get a signature key without authenticating their
        legitimacy.  It's relatively easy to break into a system and take a
        legitimate key.  The default may be changed by the user for one use
        and remain changed.  Other flaws in Explorer may be used to turn
        that feature on - then look out.

	This is not accurate.  The very nature of ActiveX makes it

	No disguise is needed for malicious ActiveX programs.  Any ActiveX
	program can potentially - either maliciously or by accident or even
	as a result of configuration differences, cause a system crash, the
	corruption or destruction of information and/or unlimited leakage
	and it doesn't depend on some hard-to-find hole in an otherwise

	Even if you choose wisely, ActiveX is a hole waiting to be exploited
	and provides essentially no protection.  As the folks at Microsoft

I appreciate your insightful opinion on this matter, however...
	"...while providing appropriate safeguards" is just not true.
	Microsoft has a long history of providing systems with no
	protection, and only recently introduced the first system with
	even mild protection in it's NT product.  Java provides a lot of
	functionality within the "sandbox", but I am not an advocate of
	Java either. The syle of computing being pushed out to consumers
	is inherently risky and must be implemented with substantial controls
	if it is to be used safely. But this is not Microsoft's goal.

	There is nothing wrong with having signatures, but it is no
        guarantee either.

I appreciate your insightful opinion on this matter, however...  Microsoft
	still has not addressed Work Macro viruses, PC viruses, Windows

This is what annoys me most about this response: not only are Microsoft
attempting to justify giving away the family silver, but they're also trying
to imply that they're the ones responsible for the idea of code signing
(just like MS and IBM have been implying that they've recently invented
multitasking....).

When Java was announced at the Sun UK User Group conference back in '95,
Chuck McManis said that code signing was in the plan, and that the main
problem was the US export controls. He also commented that while exporting
decent authentication software wasn't allowed, Sun had been told that there
was nothing wrong, in principle, in shipping "a library for doing math with
really big numbers". :-)

I wasn't following Java back when it was called Oak and set-top boxes were
the name of the game, but I wouldn't be hugely surprised to discover that
signed code was part of the plan even then. Anyone with more authority care
to comment?

Subject: ActiveX - a real world view

While at a technical level, most of what has been said about ActiveX and
security is correct. It's worth noting that users take code from untrusted
sources all the time.  While the experience of users says that code they
download is mostly well intended (even if it has harmful bugs) it's going to
be a hard sell trying to convince them that a limited Java model is "better"
than ActiveX.

I'm using ActiveX on software.net (a restartable download control from
centric development).  Our experience it that it has a close to 100%
acceptance rate by users (as compared to less than 50% for Netscape plug
ins).  Certainly the cute "certificate" dialog has a very positive impact on
user confidence.

We're about to start signing all the downloads from software.net (we
download 1600+ commercial titles).  We had an interesting debate about the
ethics of signing other peoples code.  However the user perception issue won
out, we will sign the archives that we download (but not the applications
inside them).

In all the research we've done (and we download a lot of software) users big
perceived risk is that their credit card # will be stolen.  The idea that
the copy of Microsoft Word we download to them may not be the real thing
does not even feature.

The corporation is being sued, I think, because it allegedly tolerates a
culture of racism. At least part of (perhaps all?) the evidence for this
happens to be an e-mail passed between employees.  How this e-mail came to the
attention of those who wish to sue has not been specified - at least by this
discussion.

There is a risk here if the courts were to find the corporation liable
because it failed to prevent the e-mail being distributed in the first place
(hardly practical or, indeed, desirable) or it is found responsible for the
attitudes of its employees _soley_ on the basis of such e-mail.

The relationships that existed between the people with whom the e-mail was
communicated are surely relevant. For example, if the e-mail was sent to
_all_ the white members of a group, but specifically not to the black
members of the same group by the supervisor of that group then I personally
think that might well be considered unprofessional behaviour in need of a
disciplinary response. If it was sent to the black members too then that
would either be stupid, tactless or both stupid and tactless.

If the e-mail was sent between friends then, yes, the ethics of the situation
are different, even if the ethics of the "humour" itself are not.

E-Mail should not, ipso facto, be eliminated as evidence simply because it is
e-mail. E-Mail happens to have the property, unlike the spoken word, of
automatically leaving traces of itself about the place. This means that,
technically, it is good evidence. Of course, one assumes that the e-mail in
question was not digitally signed and is therefore not _very_ good evidence
:-).

Of course, this is not to say that e-mail should always be used as
evidence. Clearly privacy concerns are important. If the e-mail in this case
came to light because a system administrator snooped it, then it probably
shouldn't qualify as evidence. If it came to light because one of its
recipients decided to divulge it then it's fair game.  What's the bet that
it came to light because someone printed it and pinned it to wall?

It would be interesting to learn more about the circumstances of this matter
and what the eventual outcome of the case is. One suspects that the media
will not report it unless there is something controversial about the ruling.

I'd expect that the consumers affected would have the option of suing for
actual damages (i.e. phone charges) from the fraudulent scam operators.
This would be akin to having your car stolen and illegally parked--the
parking tickets would come to you as the registered owner of the vehicle.
You could attempt to get the thief to cover your costs (if you can identify
him/her :), or argue with the municipal parking clerk to waive them.

>> ... But if you steal my phone line, AT&T thinks I'm at fault.

This is an improper analogy.  A more proper analogy: If someone steals your
car, and crashes it into another car, totalling both, the owner of the other
car is not responsible.  If someone steals your phone line and makes lots of
calls, AT&T is not responsible.

The difference is that in the car situation, one or both insurance companies
will pick up the costs (in most states), and then try to recover from the
thief.  You probably don't have wire fraud insurance.  But perhaps AT&T
should.

In reality, such insurance would probably not be a good investment for
either AT&T or the insurance company, because wire fraud, unlike car theft,
is guaranteed to happen to AT&T.  Instead, AT&T increases rates a little (in
effect, implicitly selling you the wire fraud insurance) to cover the costs
of fraud.  This seems fair, because wire fraud is relatively unlikely for
any particular customer, just like car theft.

Of course, as you point out, AT&T is better off if they can make you pay for
it, but that doesn't mean AT&T is right, it just means they're acting in
self-interest, which is exactly what most of their shareholders would want.
