Subject: Fault-tolerant software for escaping "upgrade hell"

The recent America Online blackout has spurred my thinking on the subject of
decreasing the risks of software upgrades for real-time systems. I want to
highlight for your readers some very significant techniques that I perceive
to be underutilized to date and, if developed and used widely in the future,
could hold great promise in drastically reducing the hazards of simple
software upgrades. They are inspired by a maddeningly familiar pattern in
software upgrades one might call "upgrade hell":

The fundamental difficulty we are observing in real-time software is that
the system is often only designed to run one version of the software at a
time. Designers are forced to bring "down" the system while they install new
software, which may or may not function correctly. Often they can only test
the full range of behavior or reliability of the new software by actually
installing it and running it "live". Then, if the software fails to work, a
process that in itself may be difficult to detect, they are forced to "down"
the system again, and reinstall the old version of the software, if such a
thing is even possible (in some cases the configuration of the new version
is such that an older version cannot be readily reverted to).

This story repeats itself endlessly in many diverse software applications,
from very large distributed systems down to individual PC upgrades.  
In pondering this I came to some observations.

1. Many designers currently assume that new versions of software will be
   "plug-and-play" compatible with older versions.

2. Systems are designed to run one version of software at a time.

3. A system has to be inactive during transitions between versions.

4. Upgrades are only occasional and the downtime due to them is acceptable.

These basic features of software and hardware interplay, despite their wide
adherence, are not in fact "carved in stone". Could we imagine a directly
contrasting system in which they are fundamentally different?

1. Let us assume that new software is not necessarily compatible with
   previous versions even where it should be, despite our best attempts to 
   make it so. In fact let us assume that humans are notoriously fallible 
   in creating such a guarantee and that in fact such a guarantee cannot be
   realistically achieved.

2. Let us imagine a system in which multiple versions of software (at least
   two) can be running simultaneously.

3. Let us imagine a system that "stays running" even during software version
   upgrades.

4. Let us assume upgrades are periodic, inevitable, and ideally the system
   would "stay running" even throughout an upgrade.

The above assumptions lead to some attractive properties of the whole I will
describe. One feature is similar to the way drives can be configured to
"mirror" each other, such that if either fails the other will take over
seamlessly and the bad one "flagged" for replacement. Imagine now that
computations themselves are "mirrored" in the hardware such that two
versions of software are running concurrently, and the software checks
itself for mismatches between the results of the computations where they are
supposed to be compatible (this can be done at many different scales of
granularity at the decision of the designer). The software could
automatically flag situations in which the new code is not functioning
properly, even while running the old version.

What we have is a sort of "shadow computation" going on behind the scenes.
When a designer wants to run a new version of software, he could "shadow" it
behind the currently running software to test its reliability without
actually committing to running it.

Under this new system, software upgrades tend to blend together:

- There is a point where only the old version is running.
- Then the old and the new version are overlapping or the new "shadowing"
  the old but the new not actually determining final results.
- Then reliability is actually measured, and continued to be
  measured until gauged sufficient.
- Finally, the actual commitment to running the new version alone 
  can be made.
- Additionally, keeping around old versions that can be switched to
  immediately in times of crisis would be a very powerful advantage--
  losing some new functionality but preserving basic or core functions.

There would be vastly fewer "gotchas" in this system than those I outlined
above in the classic "upgrade hell" scenario. Once the concept of different
versions is embodied within in the software itself by the above principles,
rather than it being considered foreign or external to the system, we have
other very powerful techniques that can be applied:

A "divide and conquer" approach can be used to isolate bad new components.
Different new components, all part of the new upgrade, can be selectively
turned "on" or "off" (but still shadowed) to find the combination of new
components that creates bad results based on the "live" or "on-the-fly"
benchmarks of previous software. In fact, it may become possible to write
software that actually automates the process of upgrading in which new
versions of the components are switched on by the software itself based on
passing automated reliability tests.  The whole process of upgrading then
becomes streamlined and systematic and begins to transcend human
idiosyncracies.

These new assumptions could lead to radically different software and
hardware systems with some very nice properties, potentially achieving what
by today's standards seems elusive to the point of impossibility yet
immensely desirable to the point of necessity: robust fault tolerance and
continued, uninterrupted service even during software upgrades. Of course,
the above techniques are inherently more difficult to achieve in
implementation, but the cost-benefit ratio may be wholly acceptable and even
desirable in many mission-critical applications, such as utility-like
services like telecommunications, cyberspace, company transactions, etc.

One difficulty of implementing the new assumptions above relative to
software is that often such changes need to be made from the ground up,
starting with hardware. But the software and hardware industries have shown
themselves to be very adaptable to massive redesigns relative to new ideas
and philosophies if they are shown to be efficacious in the final analysis
despite some initial inconvenience, such as object oriented programming.  I
am not saying the above alterations are appropriate for all applications.
They can also be introduced to varying degrees in different situations,
ranging from a mere simplicity in switching between versions all the way to
fully concurrent and shadowed computation with multiple versions immediately
available.

Also, I am sure your astute readers can point out many situations in which
the ideas I am outlining already exist. I am not saying they are novel.
However the emphasis on them in a collection as a basic paradigm I have not
seen before. In the same way that many designers were using OOP principles
such as encapsulation, polymorphism, etc. before they were focused into a
unified paradigm, I believe the above ideas could benefit from such a
focused development, such as designing hardware, software, and languages
that explicitly embody them. Many of the ideas I outline are used in
software development pipelines and distinct QAQC divisions of companies--
but I am proposing incorporating them in the machines themselves, which to
my knowledge is a novel perspective.

Actually, the root concept behind these ideas is even more general than mere
application to software. It is the idea that "the system should continue to
function even as parts of it are replaced". We see that this basic premise
can be applied to both hardware and software. It is such a basic attribute
that we crave and demand of our increasingly critical electronic
infrastructures, yet so difficult to achieve in practice. Isolated parts of
our systems today have this property-- is it the case that it is gradually
spreading to the point it may eventually encompass entire systems?

Many of these ideas come to me in considering a new protocol I am devising
called the "directed information assembly line" (DIAL), a now-brief
theoretical construct that supports such features, which I can forward to
any interested correspondents who send me e-mail. Some of the key
assumptions I am reexamining are those given above. I believe that actually
changing our assumptions about the reliability of humans to be more lenient
can actually improve the reliability of our systems. Let us start from new
assumptions, including "humans are fallible", rather than "humans approach
the limit of virtual infallibility if put under enough pressure" (such as
that always associated with new versions and software upgrades).

Subject: RISKy cars coming!

In the 22 Jul 1996 issue of Fortune was an interesting look into the future
of automobile electronics, "Soon Your Dashboard Will Do Everything (Except
Steer)".  The topic of steering has already been discussed in this forum,
but what caught my eye was a review of the "OnStar" product from GM.
Besides being a navigation aid, it also contains "some anti-bonehead
features".  These include the ability for you to call GM's "control center"
for help if you lock your keys in the car, or forget where you parked it.
From the control center, they can "electronically reach into the car" to
unlock the doors, or honk the horn and flash its lights.

Since the article doesn't discuss how the control center will authenticate
that you really own the car you are asking them to unlock, or what measures
are used to prevent a would-be control center from gaining access, it's not
clear how the term "bone-head feature" should be applied...

While trying to download the 128-bit high-security version of Netscape,
there was a notice about how they try to verify that you are a US Resident.
Apparently they pass on the information you entered to another service and
presumably if you don't show up you don't get to download the software.

That service is: http://www.lookupusa.com/lookupusa/ada/ada.htm
[[ SHORTC~1.URL : 4620 in SHORTC~1.URL ]]

I found this rather interesting.  My name is not listed in most of these
lists because they are usually based on phone numbers and mine is unlisted.
This one, however, had my name and address, but no phone number.  Not only
that but it directly connects with a mapping service so you can get a direct
map for the person's exact location.  Quite neat, until you start to realize
that it won't be long and people will VERY EASILY be able to find out a lot
about you.  Getting a map with an X on your house doesn't please me if
someone is ticked off at me.  Say they don't like my driving style on my
motorcycle.  (naw couldn't happen) Although personal information is no
longer available from CA DMV I do believe you can get someone's Name from
the license plate.

Now the Business lookup is even more fun.  Not only can you map the location
but you can get a Credit profile.  Ours says Satisfactory.  For $3.00 you
can get the complete information.

Enjoy, and protect your valuable information.

Subject: Operator error or system design fault in Atlanta 911?

Last weekend the national press here in the UK published extracts from the
police transcripts of the emergency traffic concerning the Atlanta bomb.

One thing that struck me was the operator's belief that the system's refusal
to accept Centennial Park as a valid location was her fault.  She even
queried with the Police dispatcher whether she had spelled Centennial
correctly.

I see two risks. Firstly, an overexpectation that a computerised system is
error-free, and that every problem is operator error.  Secondly, the
deskilling of the operator's job increases the first risk.

Subject: The 1994 A300-600 Nagoya accident - final report

Aviation Week and Space Technology, 29 July 1996, pp36-37, contains the
article "Pilots, A300 Systems Cited in Nagoya Crash" by Eiichiro Sekigawa
and Michael Mecham, which summarises the final report of the Japanese
Aircraft Accident Investigation Committee into the tail-first crash of China
Air 140 into the runway at Nagoya on 26 April 1994, along with further
information on the history of the A300 flight-control design for
automatic/manual interactions.

Thus this accident has HCI aspects. It was discussed extensively in RISKS
editions 16.05 (Stalzer), 16.06 (Wittenberg), 16.07 (Ladkin), 16.09
(Yesberg), 16.13 (Terribile), 16.14 (Ladkin, Overy), 16.15 (Shafer, Dorsett,
Overy, Kaplow), and 16.16 (Dorsett, Ladkin, Kaplow, Mellor, Niland). The
final report contains no surprises.  Early rumors of a higher-than-expected
blood alcohol level in the pilots (there is normally some found in autopsy,
due to decomposition) and of an electrical power failure before the accident
did not finally figure.  All comments below within quotation marks "..." are
quotations from Aviation Week.

The final report said that the crash was the result of the pilots fighting
the autopilot.  It concluded that the pilots were inadequately trained in
the "use and operational characteristics" of the autopilot.  It also faulted
Airbus Industrie's cockpit design, specifically the position of the
autopilot's TOGA (takeoff/go-around) lever beneath the throttle; and
"unclear writing" in the Flight Crew Operations Manual (FCOM).

The sequence of events was as follows. The First Officer (FO) was flying the
approach to Nagoya, using the Flight Director (FD) and autothrottle, and
accidentally triggered the takeoff/go-around (TOGA) lever (at time T), which
is positioned just below the throttle levers. This caused the automatic
flight system to go into `go-around' (GA) mode: the FD issued `pitch-up'
commands. The captain noticed it, autothrottle was disengaged and thrust
manually increased. Autopilots 1 and 2 were engaged (it's not clear why,
perhaps in thinking to recapture the glideslope - the descent path - from
which the aircraft had now departed), which didn't help since the AFCS was
in GA mode. The aircraft was flying 18 degrees nose-up. The FO attempted for
20 seconds to force the nose down by pushing hard on the control column,
thus `fighting' the autopilot, which in response rolled in full nose-up trim
to keep the pitch up. Finally, at T+45, the autopilots were disengaged, the
captain took control. However, the alpha-floor protection triggered at T+50
from excessive angle-of-attack (that means that the aircraft was close to
stalling) and brought in maximum thrust. However, this increased the nose-up
attitude to over 52 degrees (since the wing was barely flying because the
airplane was by now so slow, the thrust generated a pitch-up moment about
the horizontal axis through the wings, which was uncountered by aerodynamics
at such a slow speed). The captain disengaged alpha-floor by retarding
thrust, but the airplane had slowed to 78 knots, stalled at 1,800ft above
the runway threshold, and crashed tail-first.

The cockpit voice recorder (CVR) shows the pilots were confused as to why
the aircraft was not responding to the heavy manual nose-down command,
despite C's recognising that GA mode had been engaged.  The autopilot on all
transport-category aircraft including this one can be manually disengaged by
pushing the red autopilot-disconnect button on the handgrip of the control
wheel.  There is also an on/off switch on the cockpit forward control panel
of A300/310 series aircraft which can be used to disconnect the autopilot.

The accident aircraft had automatic yoke-force disengagement of the
autopilot inhibited below 1,500 ft AGL to avoid accidental disengagement of
the autopilot during automatic landings.  Airbus had already issued service
bulletin SB A300-22-6021 recommending modification of the flight control
computer (FCC) to allow disengagement by significant control column force
above 400 ft AGL.  China Air had not modified the accident airplane to SB
A300-22-6021.  Airbus "resisted changing its autopilot software below 400
ft. [sic] out of concern that pilots would have insufficient time to recover
control if they inadvertently moved the yoke during an automatic blind
landing." However, in March 1996 Airbus modified the system to deactivate
below 400 ft. against yoke pressure of 45 lb. push and 100 lb. pull.

The Committee 
   o   said that alpha-floor combined with the unusual out-of-trim state in
       fact generated a heavy pitch-up moment, the opposite of what would
       be needed for stall recovery. It recommended that the BEA "study" this;
   o   said that the captain misjudged the situation and should have taken over
       flight control earlier;
   o   noted that Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas aircraft would have
       automatically disengaged the autopilot when heavy yoke forces were
       applied. "Their autopilots are also less likely to trim against
       pilot yoke inputs";
   o   criticized Airbus for eliminating an audio alert for the
       stabilizer-trim-in-motion condition when the THS is in autopilot
       control. "Airbus should consider making the [..] sound in a
       THS out-of-trim condition, or if the THS moves continuously,
       regardless of autopilot engagement";
   o   said Airbus needed "to study the function, mode-display and
       warning/alert system"  in the current automatic flight-control
       system to "consider" pilot reactions. It concluded that the present
       system is too complicated in emergencies. "The BEA rejected
       this criticism";
   o   called for Airbus to "improve" the FCOM instructions for manual
       override of the autopilot system, its disengagement in GA mode,
       and recovery procedures from an out-of-trim condition.
   o   "was critical of Airbus" for not making modification
       SB A300-22-6021 mandatory in light of three similar incidents in
       1985, 1989 and 1991; 
   o   recommended that manufacturers standardize specifications
       of automatic flight systems to make pilot training easier.

The US National Transportation Safety Board has accepted the findings of the
report, as did Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration (with only minor
reservations). But the opinion of the French Bureau Enqu`etes Accidents
differs in certain aspects, and the report includes a rebuttal of the BEA
view.

The captain had over 2,600 hours in B747 and over 1,600 hours in A300-600
airplanes, as well as over 4,800 hours air force flight service. The FO had
over 1,000 hours in the A300-600. Their behavior in fighting the autopilot,
rather than disconnecting it (notwithstanding the yoke-force-disconnect on
other airplanes); and in trying to force the airplane onto the ground
(rather than going around and landing on the next try), remains simply
incomprehensible to most pilots including this one.

More details and a fuller explanation of technical terms may be found
under the Nagoya synopsis of my compendium `Computer-Related Incidents
and Accidents with Commercial Airplanes', accessible from

I disagree. This view seems to be unnecessarily defeatist. What we are
talking about here is measuring an attribute of a software-based system
which is usually referred to as "maintainability" and can be defined
quantitatively as "effort required to diagnose and fix a fault".

Software producers are in a position to measure this. (Whether they actually
do or not is another matter.) The procedure to be followed would be
something like the following:-

1. During the system trial (or beta-test), every failure is recorded 
   by the testers (or users) and reported to the design authority, 
   with all relevant data, such as symptoms and exception messages 
   observed at the time, memory dumps subsequently taken, etc. 

2. The design authority then diagnoses the latent fault that was activated
   and so gave rise to the failure. This would involve finding out:- 

   a) the location of the fault within the software, 
   b) the identity of the fault in terms of what exactly is wrong 
      with the code, the module specification, or whatever, 
   c) the "trigger" conditions which activate the fault, and 
   d) a classification of the fault according to its cause 
      (e.g., programming error, specification error, etc.) and 
      effect (e.g., system crash, files corrupted, etc.). 

3. The DA then devises a "fix", which might be a "work-around" to 
   avoid the trigger conditions, or a modification to the software 
   to remove the fault permanently. 

4. Regression testing is then required to ensure that the fix is 
   effective, and that it does not introduce any new faults. 

5. The effort (person-hours), overhead costs (e.g., machine time 
   for regression testing), and elapsed time taken, are recorded for 
   each of these steps. 

The result is a set of statistics (effort, cost and time to diagnose 
and fix each fault reported) which can be used as the basis for 
estimating effort, cost and time to deal with any fault reported 
during live use of the system. 

Obviously, the effort, cost and time will vary, but a statistical 
analysis would yield useful figures such as mean time to repair (MTTR) 
and standard deviation, or median time to repair (MeTTR) with percentiles 
(and similar statistics for cost and effort). The analysis could 
also break down the cost, effort and time by type, location, and 
severity of the fault. 

Armed with this information, the producer is now in a position to 
make a sensible estimate of repair time, with confidence intervals, 
based on past data. 

OK, this makes it sound simple, and I am fairly sure that few software
producers actually compile such statistics. (I would be very interested to
hear from any who do!) The best I could get (many years ago, for a support
team debugging large mainframe operating systems) was a vague statement from
the support manager to the effect that "My staff get through about three a
week each."

However, if this seems odd, or unnecessarily onerous in terms of data
collection, bear in mind that it is quite normal for hardware equipment to
be sold with quoted mean time to failure (MTTF) and mean time to repair
(MTTR), with both of these statistics broken down to apply to particular
modes of failure. (In the hardware case, which widget has dropped off, and
how long does it take to find and fit a new one?)  The reliability (measured
by MTTF), availability (MTTF/(MTTF+MTTR)) and maintainability (measured by
MTTR) are known.

[In the software case, there is a slight complication. Since software faults
tend to be transient (remove the trigger conditions and the failure
condition goes away), the attribute "recoverability", measured in terms of
"time to restore service", is of equal interest to maintainability.
(Typically, you record and report the failure, reboot the system, and carry
on working while the diagnosis and repair takes place off-site.) ]

As long as software producers are unwilling to make the necessary
measurements, then software development and support will continue to remain
a "black art", and will not merit the term "software engineering" in the
same way that we talk about "mechanical engineering", "civil engineering",
etc.

> ... Not something that I want to hook my house up to.

Sorry about that, but your house is hooked up to it.  Philadelphia Electric
used to be pretty good about reserve capacity. (I haven't lived there for
years, so I don't currently know.)  However, what do you think caused the
Great Northeast Power Blackout?  What was obviously the real cause of the
recent western blackouts?  The interconnect grids are great if demand stays
within bounds, but when heavily stressed they become amplifiers.

In the recent past politicians and financial analysts alike have been
encouraging utilities to reduce their on-line excess capacity, and to shut
down plants when not required for the current demand level.  But excess
capacity on-line is necessary to have a stable interconnect system.  The
difference in stability between 10 plants at running at of 81% capacity and
9 plants at 90% is dramatic.  (If one facility has a glitch the network goes
wild.  It has just been thrown from stable operation into instantaneous
overload, and at the best of times it will take the network hundreds of
milliseconds--a dozen or so cycles--to stabilize.  If transients cause
generation facilities or transmission lines kick out before substations, the
system is gone before any humans can react.)

The Northeast Blackout was caused by a coil failing in a relay in Niagara
Falls.  The relay had a backup coil which was energized immediately, and the
main contacts never completely opened.  In other words, the failover met
specification.  By the time the (amplified) voltage transient reached New
York City, the result was spectacular, did damage in the tens to hundreds of
millions of dollars, and killed a number of people.  Some of you just saw a
similar demonstration.  Trying to figure out whether a fire in Idaho or a
breaker tripped in California started the electric dominos toppling is
detail.  The important lesson is that if you run a grid too near the edge it
amplifies fluctuations and imbalances.  One glitch and we all reap the
whirlwind.
