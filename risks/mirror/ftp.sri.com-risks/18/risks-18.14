Subject: Largest Computer Error in US Banking History: US$763.9 BILLION?

Approximately 800 customers of the First National Bank of Chicago were
surprised to see that their balances were $924 million more than they
expected last week. The cause was the traditional ``change in a computer
program''.

According to The American Bankers Association, the total of $763.9 billion
was the largest such error in US banking history. Do the RISKS Archives
agree?

When Jeff Ferrera and Cindy Broadwater checked their checking balance at the
First National Bank of Chicago, the automated voice gave it as
$924,844,208.32.  More than 800 other folks had similar stories to tell.
The sum total for all accounts was $763.9 billion, more than six times the
total assets of First Chicago NBD Corp.  The problem was attributed to a
``computer glitch''.

Subject: Credit Lyonnais Fire

I'm not sure how widely this was reported, but the head office of the Credit
Lyonnais (a bank) in Paris (8e, rue du Quatre Septembre) had a major fire a
few weeks ago.  I forget the date, but it was a Saturday and the fire burned
for quite a while.  The investigation is proceeding, but my source of
information has some things to say that may be interesting to RISKS readers:

    1. The VMS machines in the building were part of a cluster that was
       replicated remotely.

       So far so good.

    2. There appears to have been no sprinkler system or fire doors
       in the building.  I've seen it, from the outside, and it's more
       or less gutted.

       Asking for trouble?

    3. The UNIX machines were backed up daily, except for Fridays which
       was done on Sunday.  These machines were backed up to tape and
       it appears that the tapes stay in the machines until just before
       the next backup is done.  Remember, the fire was on saturday.

       24 hour operations are not that expensive.  Courier the tapes
       offsite, after they've been written.  Offsite parallel operations?

    4. On the Saturday the UNIX machines had the tapes for Thursday night
       still loaded.  They had not yet been put in the fireproof safe and
       the backup of Friday's data had not commenced.

       Backup your data ASAP, preferably to a remote site across a        
       network.  If the tapes have to stay on site, put them in the safe.

    5. In the middle of the _fire_ someone realised this small problem and
       _while the fire was still burning_ the tapes were rescued from the
       UNIX machines and from the fireproof safe.

       I wonder who volunteered?

    6. Apparently the fireproof safe was not deemed to be waterproof or
       taking the tapes _during_ the fire was deemed a better choice than
       maybe getting them later.

       Water follows fire. 

    7. From the news reports it appeared that there was also some concern
       over whether safe deposit boxes (in the basement?) were waterproof.

All of this is unconfirmed, but I think my source is ok.

BTW: I bank with the Societe Generale.

Subject: Computers facilitate foolishness

I saw a demonstration of modern computer-voice-recognition s/w tied to modern
ideographic text-processing software.  It appeared to me to work pretty well
(given that I didn't understand the language involved).

Even a few years ago, it appeared that the "information age" was generating
forces which would push people away from ideographic writing systems.  Most
intellectual work would be supported by computerized systems running on
alphabetic text; ideographic processing when available was costly, awkward,
and slow.  Furthermore, hardly anyone could program his computer (in the
general sense) using ideograms.  Though people using different alphabets
could exchange information fairly easily, ideographic data was not very
portable.

These forces seemed progressive.  Alphabetic writing systems are much more
convenient for most purposes than ideographic ones.  Worse, cultures using
ideographic systems force their young to spend tremendous amounts of time and
effort memorizing ideograms--time which they could otherwise devote to
productive or entertaining activities.  Ideographic systems are bad for people
with poor visual memories; though they may be capable of intellectual work,
they find themselves crippled by their obdurate writing system.

But now computer advances (not unanticipated) will relieve some pressures
which worked to push people away from ideographic systems.  The tedium of
penmanship will go away.  Recognition of ideograms for programmatic purposes
will become widely available.  Most computer systems will become able to
process and display ideographic text.

I fear that the usual forces of reaction and inertia which operate to maintain
the cultural status quo may overpower the diminished forces of progress.
Even though ideographic writing systems are demonstrably counter-productive,
the slow-to-accrue benefits of abandoning them may never outweigh the
instantaneous costs of doing so in the minds of adult (already ideographized)
decision-makers.

Advances in computer systems will enable us to avoid advances in our "human
systems."  Heck, it's worse than "will enable us to avoid advances."  It's
more like "will actively retard us..."

Subject: Screensaviour?

The 17 May 96 FORWARD (an American Jewish interest weekly newspaper),
page 5, has a brief article about a Jewish CD-ROM put out by the
Jewish Publications Society that had a Christian gospel screensaver
by mistake.

JPS is a large Jewish publisher.  But they had never done a CD-ROM
before, so they asked Logos Research Systems, a leader in Christian
software products, to do the scutwork.  Apparently the screensaver
was added in at the last minute, and since there were no instructions
regarding it, the generic Logos screensaver was packaged in, and
presumably nobody beta (beth?) tested it.

JPS and Logos are now splitting the cost of replacing hundreds of
CD-ROMs already sold, and are pulling off those on the shelves.

Subject: 12am: noon or midnight?

There are compelling reasons to consider "12 am" to mean noon,
as in the hour-by-hour sequence 10 am, 11 am, 12 am.  But just
as compelling is the minute-by-minute sequence 12:00 pm, 
12:01 pm, 12:02 pm.  People generally duck (actually clarify) the
issue by saying "12 noon" and "12 midnight."  Another dodge is to
make rules and laws go into effect at such times as 12:01 am.  But
is there a more or less universally understood meaning of 'am' or
'pm' as applied to exactly 12?  If there isn't, what should it be?
The truly logical answer to this, of course (try to get this one
through Congress) is to replace 12 by 0:  there's no confusion about
what 0 am and 0 pm would mean.  Not to me anyway.

    [Lots of folks around the world solve this by going from 
    00:00 through 12:00  to 23:59 each day.  Who needs am, p, n, and m?

Subject: The `pound' sign

The pound sign `#' is often used as shorthand for the word `fracture'  by
medical staff from the UK and other countries. For example, "Mrs Smith has
a # radius and ulna".

Our hospital computer systems move data from one system to another.  If Mrs
Smith's diagnosis is entered as above on the administrative system and then
her information is called up from the pathology system the diagnosis appears
as "=A3 radius and ulna".

Of course, the same problem may occur in transmission of this message.  The
pound or hash sign is replaced by the stylised L used to designate the pound
sterling (currency).

RISK: the patient's arm may be more valuable to pathology than anyone else.

Subject: Addendum to my tirade on bad numbers (... Births, RISKS-18.10)

I'm watching CNN as background noise and they are touting the use of
Astrology for investing. The problem is just another illustration of how
difficult it is to get straight information to form ones one judgment. They
noncritically report that three successful predictions including the Gulf
war. There is not an iota of incredulousness -- not only does the reporter
not do fact checking (what is a prediction?) there isn't even the idea of
checking to see if there is any significance against the larger set of
predictions. Astrology is an obvious target but there is no reason to assume
any of the other reports are any better researched. Reminds me of the great
Dilbert strip where the Boss is determined to track down the miscreants
since a full 40% of the sick days were on Monday or Friday. But it's not
just innumeracy.

Lest we be smug (whoever "we" are) the same naivete appears in assuming that 
one can simply design a system and deploy it without a continual learning and 
refinement cycle. (formerly known by its denigrated name of "maintenance").

Subject: When your last name's also a first name ...

I have the misfortune to have both an unusual first name (Scottish Gaelic)
and a last name which passes muster as a first name in most, if not all, of
the English-speaking parts of the world.

Our Microsoft Exchange mail system stores names as <last name> <first name>.
So I am seen by the world as "Scott Alastair" when Exchange puts its own
header at the top of mail messages I send. Despite many variations - of
increasing literary violence - of signature most (about 75%) of my Internet
email is addressed, "Dear Scott".

I am told that names are stored as <last name> <first name> because, for
example, the sender can type "Scott Al" and Exchange will match my name
automatically without the poor sender having to spell "Alastair" correctly.

A fix has been considered - storing the names as <last name>, <first name> -
but was rejected as too risky because people would forget the comma.

So I can't win! If an Alistair Scott (note the spelling, which is
actually more common than my spelling) joins,

Subject: Number cruncher derides numbers

A story in the 29 Apr 1996 issue of Web Week, a magazine devoted to the
World-Wide Web, describes new developments in the controversy between
Nielsen Media Research and a group of academics from Vanderbilt and North
Carolina, who criticized an earlier Nielsen study as overstating Internet
usage in the US and Canada.

The magazine quotes the following from David Harkness, senior VP of
Nielsen Media Research: "What doesn't matter now, in my opinion, is
how many users there were in August of last year, because the Internet
is growing so fast. The Internet is not being served by this debate".

The last comment may cause anyone who has forked out $5,000 - what the
magazine says it takes to buy a copy of the Nielsen report - to raise an
eyebrow or two. Are we to understand that the purpose of such a study is to
"serve the Internet", that is to say cheer up everyone in the Internet
industry by reporting good news, rather than provide a snapshot of the
reality?

But the most interesting part remains the first sentence in Mr. Harkness's
comment. If I understand properly: let's not quibble about minor differences
between the two studies (a mere 8 million people - or actually 20 million,
making the result more than 100% off target, if you compare Nielsen's
"Internet access" numbers with the academics' estimates of actual Internet
use!); we all know the Internet is expanding by leaps and bounds.


Which of course brings up the whole question of why we should trust
Nielsen's numbers any more than Mr. Harkness seems to. For example,
according to his study, 1.51 million people have used the Web to make
a purchase. Even if you bought the report, better double-check before
making a major policy decision based on such statistics.

Call for Participation
Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Conference on Risk Management:
acquisition, programs, projects, systems, and software

Managing Uncertainty in a Changing World
Hotel Cavalier
Virginia Beach, Virginia
April 7-9, 1997

In today's world of downsizing and reengineering, you're moving into
uncharted territory. You've been asked to acquire and develop systems with
less money, and said, "I can do that."  You've been asked to succeed with
shorter schedules, and said, "I can do that."  You've been asked to use fewer
people, and said, "I can do that."

So, how can you do that? 

You need to improve your ability to acquire systems, to proactively manage
your resources, people, schedules, and budgets--to predict and avoid
problems before they occur. You must rapidly integrate, under controlled
conditions, the acquisition of complete systems providing end users with
predictable system performance. You need to determine which risks are more
critical to the success of your program to make effective use of scarce
resources. You need proven methods and techniques as well as suggestions for
advanced capabilities.

Acquisition practices and risk management are being implemented and improved
throughout the government and industry. To maintain your competitive edge in
this uncertain world, you need effective acquisition and risk management
practices. This conference is a way to find out what's going on and what's
applicable and useful to you.

The SEI Conference on Risk Management will provide a forum that brings
together the government, industry, and academic managers, practitioners,
change agents, and researchers using and exploring risk management and
acquisition. The conference will provide a unique forum for exchanging ideas
and experiences with experts and professionals who practice or study
acquisition and risk management. This is a tremendous opportunity to
increase your awareness and to advance your knowledge and skills by being
exposed to the latest methods, tools, and techniques, and some of best
practices in the field of system development and acquisitions. Managers will
find the means to improve their ability to make informed decisions and to
gain better control of their project's cost, schedule, and technical
contents. Practitioners will find the ways to increase awareness of risks
and their ability and skills to avoid or mitigate them. Both development and
acquisition professionals will gain insight from the experiences of leading
experts and professionals, learn about the latest developments and
technological issues, and learn how to manage uncertainty in a changing
world.

The SEI Conference on Risk Management will feature keynote speakers,
distinguished presenters, selected presentations from invited speakers,
panel discussions with experts and professionals, and exhibitors. It will
also provide learning opportunities with hands-on tutorials and
opportunities to accomplish work to advance the practices of acquisition and
risk management through mini-workshops. The conference will further provide
value for different audiences such as managers and practitioners, beginners
and advanced professionals, or development and acquisition professionals
through separate tracks for presentations and panels. Opportunities to
mingle with people who have similar interests will be provided through
birds-of-a-feather sessions.

The Hotel Cavalier in Virginia Beach provides beach-side accommodations. The
Virginia Beach area is convenient to Washington, D.C. and offers golfing,
