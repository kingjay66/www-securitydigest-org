Subject: Another way to run native code from Java applets

In addition to the security bug found by Drew Dean, Ed Felten and Dan
Wallach in March, there is another way to run native code from a Java
applet, which will require a separate fix to the current versions of
Netscape (2.01 and Atlas PR2) and Sun's Java Development Kit (1.01).

Both this attack and the previous one rely on an applet being able to create
an instance of the same security-sensitive class, but each does so using an
independent hole in the bytecode verifier.

Once an applet is able to run native code, it can read, write, and execute
any local file, with the permissions of the browser.  These attacks do not
require any additional preconditions, other than viewing the attacker's web
page with Java enabled.  They can be done without the user's knowledge.

Recommended actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Netscape (2.0beta*, 2.0, 2.01):
  Disable Java (on all platforms except Windows 3.1x), and if possible
  Javascript, using the Security Preferences dialogue in the Options menu.
  Note that the section on security in the Netscape release notes is not
  up-to-date.

Netscape (Atlas PR1, PR2):
  As above, except that the options to disable Java and Javascript have 
  moved to the Languages tab in the Network Preferences dialogue.

Appletviewer (JDK beta*, 1.0, 1.01):
  Do not use appletviewer to load applets from untrusted hosts.

HotJava (alpha*):
  Sun no longer supports HotJava alpha, and does not not intend to fix
  any of its security holes until a beta version is released.

Subject: The T-43A Accident in Dubrovnik

There are many articles in RISKS wondering about various aspects of the
safety of increasing automation in aircraft. We should remember that
increased automation can also help to avoid accidents.

Nancy Leveson (RISKS-17.21) pointed out some incidents in which TCAS (the
Traffic Avoidance and Collision Alert System) seems to have helped avoid
collision accidents. In RISKS-17.89, I referred to a report that the US Navy
was speeding up acquisition of digital flight control systems for F-14s to
help avoid loss-of-control accidents.

There is another example in recent news.  From newspaper reports, it seems
as if the safety of flight IFOR 21, a US Air Force T-43A (a type of
B737-200) which crashed on approach to Dubrovnik, Croatia, could have been
enhanced by more modern navigation equipment. This flight carried US
Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown.

The USAF does not normally release results of its investigations to the
public. So I have summarised facts from a short *Washington Post* article,
two articles from *Flight International*, and a *New York Times Service*
feature article that appeared in the *International Herald Tribune* on
Monday 29 Apr 1996. I also include some of my own observations and (a link
to) the approach plate (map) for the Dubrovnik NDB Runway 12 approach that
the aircraft was in course of executing. This summary is available in the
Compendium `Computer-Related Incidents and Accidents...'  under my WWW home
page at http://www.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/~ladkin/

Subject: FAA drops navigation system contract

Citing cost overruns and schedule delays because of mismanagement, the
Federal Aviation Administration canceled a $475 million contract that was
intended to help the airlines get extremely precise navigational data from
satellites.  The FAA announced the contract in August with Wilcox Electric
Inc. of Kansas City, a subsidiary of Thomson-CSF SA of Paris.  The FAA said
the action was part of a new strategy of cutting losses early, rather than
struggling along for years with mounting delays and cost overruns.

Subject: The RISK of attributing error to malice

I'm writing this up as a reminder re: the importance of not jumping to
conclusions, especially when computers are involved. My hope is that perhaps
this story will one day be recalled by a reader facing a similar situation,
and a better outcome will result.

Recently, one of our staff members found an incomplete outgoing message in
her e-mail that she did not write. The appearance was that another staff
member might have been forging an e-mail message from her machine, but been
interrupted. The creation date was several days before the message was
found, making it appear that the creation date had been faked; there were
two copies of the message in two locations, making it appear that the
message had been copied; the writing style was not that of the machine's
owner; the issue mentioned was one that had a bone of contention between the
staff members days earlier.

In my initial investigation, I reported that without full security and a
reliable audit trail it wasn't really possible to prove that such a forgery
had been done, but that this did look suspicious. Relationships within our
group had been strained, and this was enough to start accusations flying.
The climate in the office, already toxic, grew poisonous.

Yesterday, I put my finger on the actual smoking gun: I hadn't known it
initially, but the two staffers were using Macintosh file sharing and one
was mounting the entire hard disk of the other as a server volume using the
owner password, which gave complete read and write access to the entire
volume. This was counter to our written guidelines on safe file sharing.
The mail program in question, poorly-written, stores full path names to keep
track of the folder where it creates outgoing mail. One system's internal
hard disk had been renamed from the default "Macintosh HD" and the other had
not - I'm sure most readers know by now where this is going.

The mail program found its outgoing messages folder on the wrong machine and
the message in question was created there. I replicated this exact sequence
of events on two other machines yesterday while my supervisor watched. I
haven't explained the duplicate copies on the remote machine or why the
message was seen earlier, but this isn't necessary in order to convince me
that this "forgery" was really an accident.

Upon reflection, there was no clear motive, and everyone agrees now that if
the attempt had been to defame a fellow employee, a much more coherent and
effective job would have been done. Public apologies have been made. We're
switching e-mail clients and our staff members will be expected to follow
guidelines for safe file-sharing. I personally was far, far too willing to
blame a staff member before exhausting every technical possibility. Now
we've got to work at building a trusting work environment again, and hope
that this can be put behind us, but I don't think the accused staff member
will quickly forget being the target of an unfair accusation where the only
evidence existed on a computer, and my confidence in my own judgment has
been badly shaken.

The RISK is of attributing to malice what is easily attributable to
poorly-written software, incomplete understanding of the system your
co-workers use, and failure to follow good security practices. There is a
further risk that a pre-existing climate of suspiciousness can push an
investigation of an anomaly into a witch hunt. The last RISK is that it is
too easy for someone like myself, inexperienced at managing conflicts
between staff members, to lose his objectivity and start becoming more
suspicious of a person than of a computer. As a regular RISKS reader, I
should have known better.

Subject: Need to censor AOL's name! (Re: RISKS-18.07)

I can't wait for AOL to try this with other languages.  The "am" in
"America" means the same in Turkish as what they're objecting to in
Scunthorpe.  Perhaps they need to transform themselves to "Omerica On-Line"!

The first time I ever saw the offending word in print, it was spelled with
an "o" anyway; this was in the early 60s in a script in _Plays and Players_,
a British magazine devoted to contemporary drama.  They presumably did that
to get by the English drama censor (the Lord Chamberlain, whose
idiosyncratic prohibitions provided the British intelligentsia of the time
with nearly as much amusement as their modern American counterparts get from
the CDA).

Subject: Re: AOL censors town's name! (RISKS-18.07)

It seems somewhat ironic that AOL's substitution of an 'o' for a 'u' in the
name of Scunthorpe has just translated the problem -- turning an embedded
English vulgarity into a French one, the same one just to add to the fun
(what my dictionary refers to delicately as: "Vulg. Sexe de la femme.")

AOL, or any other organisation applying such a policy on a global basis,
runs the risk of altering a name to avoid a perceived English vulgarism and
creating as much, if not more, offense in the language and culture of
origin.  This is complicated by the fact that these second-order vulgarities
would likely be unrelated to the English obsession with body parts and
functions and thus be much harder for the censor to detect.

Subject: Re: AOL censors British town's name! (RISKS-18.07)

[Long message excerpted for RISKS ...] The real message is:

1) Use PGP.

2) If you receive PGP e-mail and find it to be offensive, and only
   that, give up corresponding with the person in question.

3) (which is the crux of the matter) Does the e-mail contain a serious
   threat or form of intimidation?, in which case it is covered by the
   normal strictures against intimidation, does it contain slanders or
   libels (N.B. English law doesn't consider a statement of fact to be a
   slander or libel, so I don't in all honesty think this law counters
   freedom of speech, even though its heavier users are Tory MPs)? and
   finally is it in some other way criminal?, e.g., a chain letter to
   deprive you of all your cash, which I admit I tend to dismiss as being
   the "buyer"'s problem to worry about - AOL aren't protecting you from ANY
   of these rather larger problems.

and the message to America On Line is that they should probably provide
something on the lines of PGP, however ropy and possible to crack, and stop
fooling around with people's e-mail and free speech. IBM must have had this
problem, because under VM it was possible to monitor only your own id, not
the id of someone you managed - a lesson I think Unix should probably have
learned too (as a result a VM manager could claim not to be responsible for
the nasty activities of the users).  [...]

The AOL censorship item in RISKS-18.07 reminds me of Paul Hilfinger's story
about the time the Carnegie-Mellon University computer-center staff was
ordered by the CMU administration to change the name of the "finger" command
(despite it being an ARPAnet standard).  They changed "finger" to "where"
and also took it upon themselves to change Paul's name to "Paul Hilwhere"
(initially intending it to be temporary).  Paul actually approved of the
change (as a kind of gentle protest), and it remained that way for some
time.

> French forenames must be taken from saints and/or antiquity ...

Funny about how French mores are constantly misrepresented in the
Anglo-Saxon world - usually to present France as a kind of Soviet Union
where everything is government-regulated.

The informal guideline until a few years ago was that the name should either
be from antiquity or appear in some calendar. This includes religious
calendars (not only Catholic), but also e.g. the Revolutionary calendar,
where months appear with names like Nivose and Ventose, and days have names
like Cerise (cherry). I believe all the law said was something like local
authorities should exert proper care; the calendar approach was a pragmatic
way to resolve borderline cases. In last resort, of course, the courts would
decide.

In the past twenty years or so pragmatism has reigned, what with the large
immigrant populations (if you go to a playground you'll hear parents calling
"Leila" and "Tarik" all around - not typical Catholic saint names), the
influence of American movies (every other child seems to be called Jessica
or Gregory), and a general move towards more laxity in tolerating individual
tastes.  This clearly has some limits, and I don't think that `Brfxxx...'
would pass any more there than in Sweden.

Subject: Re: Former Oracle worker ... bogus e-mail (RISKS-18.07)

I think PGN forgets a very important one:

10. Never accept to handle the account of some other person or
    having access to his/her computer.

The reason is obvious: should that person commit any crime s/he can always
argue that since you had access to his/her account you could have forged or
impersonated him/her. If that person is your boss and more powerful and
reputed than you are, chances are s/he will be believed and you will charge
with the responsibility for the crime.

Note: I'm not implying this could in any way whatsoever have happened in the
Oracle case. But with computers it is now so easy to deny the authenticity
of any document and imply it is a forgery that loading responsibilities on
someone else's shoulders is trivial.

Adelyn Lee having Larry Ellison's password is significant. If she had his
password, she may or may not have used it to send the e-mail. But as a RISKS
matter, the technological evidence is not conclusive, even beyond some of
the ways PGN mentioned.

For example, the cellphone records don't even have to be forged. Unless they
checked all possible cellphone numbers in the area that he could have used,
they can't rule out his having both his own cellphone and another line with
a cellular modem. Or having had the e-mail sent via an at job or other
automatic scheduled mechanism. Also, was the clock set to the same time for
their computer and the cellphone records?  Conceivably, he also could have
had someone else with access do it (but allegations of conspiracy, like talk
of black helicopters, don't do much to establish the credibility of a
particular line of argument).

Since the technical evidence is not conclusive, it comes down to a
credibility and bigger lawyers issue. I'm concerned about the precedent that
may be established if judges rule on an issue while the parties have not
explored all reasonable arguments about the technology. We'll see what
happens with the perjury charge. -S.

        COORDINATION AND ADMINISTRATION OF THE INTERNET 
           Workshop Announcement and Call for Papers 
 
This is a first announcement and call for papers and proposals for a
workshop to be held at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Cambridge,
MA, USA, on September 8-10, 1996.  The workshop will address issues in the
international coordination and management of Internet operations.  We are
seeking papers which address the economic, organizational, legal and
technical issues in migrating to internationally sanctioned,
industry-supported processes and institutions.  What should a fully
internationalized Internet look like, and how do we get there from here?
 
Topics to be explored in the workshop and resulting publication include:
 
  - policy and management issues concerning
      network addresses 
      domain names 
      routing policy 
      settlements 
      interconnect points 
      intercontinental connectivity 
      quality of service standards 
 
  - legal and institutional structures for supporting core Internet functions
       
  - institutions and policies needed to ensure the future scalability and
    extensibility of the Internet
       
  - technical and implementation issues presented by heterogeneous national
    information policies
       
  - the need for data in support of Internet planning, including issues of
    how data should be collected and maintained
       
  - coordination needed for the deployment of new technology

  - international crisis management for the Internet
       
Although the Internet is already substantially privatized, certain essential
functions -- notably the domain name registry, network number assignment,
and the routing arbiter -- are still funded by the U.S. Government.  Unlike
the local telephone exchange, these integrative services are managed by
third parties, contributing to an open competitive environment which has
helped enable rapid growth of the Internet.  Rapid growth,
commercialization, and internationalization are putting stress on current
institutions and procedures -- which are neither self-sustaining nor
officially recognized at the international level.  The National Science
Foundation plans to phase out support for core administrative services and
for international connections, just as it has withdrawn support for
production-level backbone services.  Conflicts over tradenames and number
assignments suggest that international legitimacy is needed for domain name
and network number management.
 
Beyond support for essential functions, there are many practical and policy
issues where some greater degree of coordination or institutional leadership
may be desirable.  For example, how can the implementation of new technology
and protocols be expedited? What common definitions and guidelines should
exist to describe network performance?  Should the functions performed by
current Internet institutions (such as the Internic, RIPE, APNIC, and the
IANA) be brought into a more robust international infrastructure, and if so,
how?  To what extent are multilateral peering arrangements and settlements
needed to encourage continued growth and competition in the Internet access
industry?
 
The conference will engage scholars, practitioners and policy makers in
examining and discussing these issue.  It will bring together stake-holders,
academics and individual leaders within and beyond the Internet community to
help define the future institutional infrastructure of the Internet.
 
Workshop papers will be revised and edited following the workshop for
publication by MIT Press as part of the Harvard Information Infrastructure
Project series.  Potential participants are encouraged to submit papers that
can be developed and revised for publication (copyright assignment is not
required).  Please send an abstract by June 15, 1996, for review by the
program committee.
