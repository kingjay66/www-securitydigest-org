SUMMARY OF RISKS VOLUME 14, collected in RISKS-14.00 (3 Nov 1992 - 2 Sep 1993)

 The RISKS Forum is a moderated digest discussing risks; comp.risks is its 
 Usenet counterpart.  Undigestifiers are available throughout the Internet,
 but not from RISKS.  Contributions should be relevant, sound, in good taste
 good taste, objective, coherent, concise, and nonrepetitious.  Diversity is
 welcome.  CONTRIBUTIONS to RISKS@CSL.SRI.COM, with appropriate, substantive
