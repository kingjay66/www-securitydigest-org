Subject: A risk of laparoscopy

To make a long story short, Kristina A. Fox received a supposedly minimally
invasive laparoscopy in 1998.  Unfortunately, the wand-like electrical tool
that cuts tissues and seals blood vessels was emanating an undetected stray
electrical charge that created a small hole in her colon.  The complications
resulted in 13 operations and serious complications.  Her lawsuit argues
that the risk of accidents from laparoscopic surgery could be sharply
reduced with the use of fault-detection static and dynamic testing devices
that are currently available but used by only 1/4 of U.S. hospitals.  A
gynecologist is quoted as saying "It wouldn't surprise me in the least if
[this problem] caused more than 100 deaths and 10,000 injuries annually."

Subject: Security flaws could cripple missile defense network

The network that stitches together radars, missile launch sites and command
control centers for the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) ground-based defense
system has such serious security flaws that the agency and its contractor,
Boeing, may not be able to prevent misuse of the system, according to a
Defense Department Inspector General's report.

The report, released late last month, said MDA and Boeing allowed the use of
group passwords on the unencrypted portion of MDA's Ground-based Midcourse
Defense (GMD) communications network.

The report said that neither MDA nor Boeing officials saw the need to
install a system to conduct automated log audits on unencrypted
communications and monitoring systems. Even though current DOD policies
require such automated network monitoring, such a requirement ``was not in
the contract''.  [...]  [Source: Bob Brewin, *Federal Computing Week*, 16

Subject: Tesco advertising SMS unsubscription requires loyalty card membership

Buried deep, deep in the small print in the back pages of the Tesco (the
leading UK supermarket chain) mobile phone service information booklet, is a
brief sentence that if the customer wishes not to be involved in "market
research", to wit, having their demographic details tracked and shared, they
need to phone customer services and opt out.

Yesterday, my phone number transferred to the Tesco network and I put twenty
pounds into my account.

This morning, I received an advertising SMS from Tesco.

This reminded me I needed to call customer services regarding "market
research" and advertising SMSs.

Now, and here's where it gets interesting, they tell me I'm not involved in
"market research" because I don't have a club card (a loyalty card) - but
that for the same reason they *cannot unsubscribe me from advertising SMSs*.

Tesco can *add* you to their advertising SMS list without a club card, but
they cannot *remove* you without a club card.

What customer services do in this situation is that the shift manager visits
a store, picks up a blank club card, registers it to the customer and
unsubcribes them.

Subject: Elevator software risk

I work in a three-story office block.  Being so high, the building is
equipped with a pair of elevators, which appear to co-operate in handling
passenger traffic.  These are modern elevators, equipped with a female
chip-voice announcing which floor the elevator has arrived at and which
direction the elevator is about to travel in.

The upper floors of the building are lightly populated and so the bathroom
facilities on those floors are considerably more pleasant and less crowded.

I recently emerged from a pleasant, uncrowded bathroom and pressed the
button summoning an elevator.  An elevator arrived, its doors opened and a
female chip voice announced the arrival of the elevator at the first floor.

The chip voice was muffled since it was coming from the *other* elevator,
which was also on the first floor with closed doors.

I stepped inside and selected "down".

The muffled other elevator announced I was about "going down" and the doors
closed and the elevator took me to the ground floor.

The doors opened and the female chip voice from the floor above then floated
down to me..."ground floor".

I'm grateful that it was not necessary for me to operate the controls in the
other elevator.  If that had been so, I wonder if the emergency button would
still have worked?

Subject: When trusted systems fail

On Friday, March 10, McAfee's antivirus program gave users a nice lesson on
the meaning of the term "trusted system".  Due to a faulty virus definition
file, the software began deleting or "quarantining" hundreds or thousands of
legitimate system files (including, among others, Microsoft's excel.exe).

Subject: It's now a crime to delete files

What: International Airport Centers sues former employee, claiming use of a
secure file deletion utility violated federal hacking laws.

When: Decided March 8 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit
Outcome: Federal hacking law applies, the court said in a 3-0
  opinion written by Judge Richard Posner.

What happened, according to the court: Jacob Citrin was once employed by
International Airport Centers and given a laptop to use in his company's
real estate related business. The work consisted of identifying ``potential
acquisition targets''.

At some point, Citrin quit IAC and decided to continue in the same business
for himself, a choice that IAC claims violated his employment contract.

Normally that would have been a routine business dispute. But the twist
came when Citrin dutifully returned his work laptop--and IAC tried to
undelete files on it to prove he did something wrong.

IAC couldn't. It turned out that (again according to IAC) Citrin had used a
``secure delete'' program to make sure that the files were not just deleted,
but overwritten and unrecoverable.

In most operating systems, of course, when a file is deleted only the
reference to it in the directory structure disappears. The data remains on
the hard drive.  But a wealth of programs like PGP, open-source programs
such as Wipe, and a built-in feature in Apple Computer's OS X called Secure
Empty Trash will make sure the information has truly vanished.

Inevitably, perhaps, IAC sued. The relevance for Police Blotter readers is
that the company claimed that Citrin's alleged secure deletion violated a
federal computer crime law called the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

That law says whoever ``knowingly causes damage without authorization'' to a
networked computer can be held civilly and criminally liable.

The 7th Circuit made two remarkable leaps. First, the judges said that
deleting files from a laptop counts as ``damage''.  Second, they ruled that
Citrin's implicit ``authorization'' evaporated when he (again, allegedly)
chose to go into business for himself and violate his employment
contract. ...

http://edition.cnn.com/2006/US/03/11/cia.internet.ap/index.html

An interesting article, reiterating what we already know, that in the
present age of search tools, almost nothing can be hidden from those willing
to pay for someone to do a search.  The article basically says it succinctly.

Subject: Another Paypal scam, social engineering against ethical people

My wife just received what from the Subject line looked like a Paypal buyer
payment notice to her, as a seller. But she hasn't recently sold anything.
Having been taught to be very careful, she looked at the message source
before opening it.  She then checked Paypal to confirm there had been no
payment to her corresponding to this message.  So far so good, but now come
the gotchas....

When she went to forward the message (using Outlook Express) to spoof AT
paypal.com, of course the message was opened and displayed.  I figured this
was safe, since she would not open any attachments.  But, it turns out the
content of the message was a small bit of HTML, composed of just an image
with a clickable area.  In recent versions of IE, such images would be
prevented from being downloaded unless approved.  Not so in Outlook Express.
It retrieved the image, presumably identifying my wife's computer to the
originating web site. Oops.

But the interesting part is that the image was a good likeness of a Paypal
message, with a complete bogus transaction (to pay money to my wife) and a
button to click labeled "Dispute Transaction".  They are specifically
preying on people who want to correct mistakes and give money back.  That
is, preying on ethical people, not greedy people.  We didn't click on it.  I
have no idea what would have happened next, but probably a request to log
into her account to confirm the transaction was incorrect.

Subject: Mindless precision

When I worked at Bell Labs, before the breakup of the Bell System in 1984,
once in a while a memo would come around describing a change to some piece
of hardware or other that I knew nothing about.  The reason would be that
the hardware was so widely used throughout the company that the easiest way
to reach everyone who might care about it was to send a memo to every member
of management.  As an "exempt" employee, I was considered a member of
management although I had no one reporting to me.

One day I received a memo that announced that as of some date,
0.511-microfarad capacitors were going to be replaced by 0.51-microfarad
capacitors, and the old ones would no longer be available.

The punchline?  In both cases, the capacitors had +/- 10% tolerance.

  [Unfortunately, the capacity of management often has a tolerance
  greater than +/- 10%.  PGN]

Subject: Re: Complexity causes 50% of product returns (RISKS-24.19)

This problem affects more than consumer devices.  When I was working on a
project for the Army in the very early 1970's regarding repairing tank
engines, a significant fraction (1/4 - 1/3) of tank engines that were sent
back from Viet Nam had "nothing wrong" with them.  (I don't know how they
came up with this statistic -- we've all gotten our cars back from the
repair shop, only to find that the problem that we took the car into the
shop for in the first place had not been fixed.)

Of course, a number of the broken engines had been "hacked" -- i.e.,
"hot-rodded" by some good ol' boys, so they failed in a sometimes spectacular
manner.  But that is a different story...

I'm glad (well, not really) I'm not the only one who's seen their data
swallowed by Excel.  I have seen this with data provided by a custom
application for a 'large northeastern USA transit operator'.  Basically,
there's certain data that's represented in hexadecimal format.  When the
output file (comma separated values, csv) is brought into Excel, Excel
'helpfully' converts some of these into scientific notation!  And you can't
turn it off or unformat it, period.  It's converted and that's that.  I
haven't bothered calling MS, representing data as typed is apparently too
advanced a concept for them to understand...

At least what we're looking at isn't super critical, and Excel is only one
tool that we use.  The scary thing, though, is there's no warning, and you
can't turn it off.  Who knows what other liberties MS takes with your
data...

Subject: Re: Excel garbles microarray experiment data (RISKS-24.19)

I do not see this as a problem in Excel, which is a spreadsheet program
designed primarily for accounting calculations - calculations which commonly
use numbers and dates.

Rather, this is a problem introduced by the designer(s) of the "new
bioinformatics programs", who seem to have decided to use Excel as a
database program.  A crowbar can be used as a hammer, but one runs the risk
of making a large hole in a wall instead of simply driving in the nail.
Similarly, using Excel as a database instead of Oracle, or SQL Server, or
even MS Access (if for some reason use of the MSOffice suite is desired)
runs the risk of non-accounting data being interpreted as accounting data.

Subject: Re: Excel garbles microarray experiment data (RISKS-24.19)

Excel doesn't play well with others.  This is not the only kind of data
Excel garbles.

In the financial world, we use CUSIPs (8 or 9 character codes) or tickers
(1- to 5-letter codes) to identify equities.  Excel typically garbles these
by being over-helpful as mentioned in the article on micro-array data.  So,
CUSIPs are sometimes left alone and often treated as numbers because they
are a mix of letters and numerals with the a preponderance of numerals.
Tickers are less commonly mangled though there is a company with the ticker
"TRUE" which Excel decides is the value "TRUE", not the character string.

However, potentially even more insidious is the fact that Excel does not
properly handle .CSV files.  This "Comma-Separated Values" format has been
around for decades but Excel has never handled it properly.  Both on input
and output, it will often ignore the double-quotes that are intended to
distinguish character from numeric fields.

Because of this, the obvious solution of putting CUSIPs and tickers in
quotes does not work with Excel.

Perhaps even worse, there are applications that expect the Excel variant of
.CSV files and reject properly-formatted ones.  To see how ridiculously
complicated this can get, look at the section "Excel vs. Leading Zero &
Space" in http://www.creativyst.com/Doc/Articles/CSV/CSV01.htm#CSVariations.

Thus the risk of the popular error propagating, muddying the waters for
years to come.

Subject: Call For Proposals: Data Surveillance and Privacy Protection workshop

CRCS Workshop 2006: Data Surveillance and Privacy Protection

* Can you find the terrorist in your database?
* Do hospital admission records hold the secret to catching and
  confining Avian Flu outbreaks in humans?
* What do banks really know about their customers?
* What's the real purpose behind that RFID tag on your sweater?

On June 3, 2006 Harvard University's Center for Research on Computation and
Society will hold a day-long workshop on Data Surveillance and Privacy
Protection.

Although there has been significant public attention to the civil liberties
issues of data surveillance over the past few years, there has been little
discussion of the actual techniques that could be employed in any but the
most restricted settings. Likewise, there has been little discussion of
methods and technologies for conducting data surveillance while respecting
privacy and preserving civil liberties.

Today's newspapers and TV shows are preoccupied with NSA wiretaps and the
accidental release of names and social security numbers.  Meanwhile, a far
more pervasive surveillance infrastructure is being created around us: the
routine use of database information for law enforcement, counter-terrorism,
and commercial markets.

The Center for Research on Computation and Society (CRCS) is a new research
center with a mission to develop a clear understanding of issues of
technology and public policy where the actual technology makes a difference,
and to pursue innovative computer science and technology research informed
by that understanding.

Some of the issues that we would like to explore at the workshop include:

* Techniques for mining databases within and between organizations without
  exposing proprietary or privacy-sensitive information.

* Techniques that are planned for deployment (or are actually being used) to
  survey hospital admissions data for evidence of epidemics or bioterror
  attacks.

* Techniques that have been tried, or proposed, for finding terrorists or
  criminals through the examination of transactional information.

* Techniques that could be used to automatically detect phishing attacks or
  other kinds of financial fraud.

The workshop will take place on June 3, 2006. Registration for the workshop
will open in early May.

CALL FOR PAPERS AND PRESENTATIONS

The CRCS Workshop Organizing Committee is looking for academics, government
officials, business leaders, and individuals who are interested in
submitting papers or making presentations at the June 3rd workshop. If you
are interested, please send us a 2-paragraph abstract of your proposed paper
or presentation.
