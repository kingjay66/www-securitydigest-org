Subject: Browns Ferry 3 nuclear power site scrammed

This is another example of a system environment in which components that
were supposedly not safety related could compromise safety.  The case is of
considerable interest to RISKS.

On 19 Aug 2006, operators manually scrammed Browns Ferry, Unit 3, following
a loss of both the 3A and 3B reactor recirculation pumps, as required after
the loss of recirculation flow -- which placed the plant in a high-power,
low-flow condition where core thermal hydraulic stability problems may exist
at boiling-water reactors (BWRs).  Generally, intentional operation is not
permitted under this condition.  Although some BWRs are authorized for
single loop operation, sudden loss of even one pump could present the plant
with the same stability problems and could result in the reactor protection
system initiating a shutdown of the plant. [Source: Effects of
Ethernet-based, Non-safety Related Controls on the Safe and Continued
Operation of Nuclear Power Stations, United States Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, Washington, DC 20555-0001,
17 Apr 2007; PGN-ed, although the following text is abridged but unedited.]
http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/gen-comm/info-notices/2007/in200715.pdf

The initial investigation into the dual pump trip found that the
recirculation pump variable frequency drive (VFD) controllers were
nonresponsive. The operators cycled the control power off and on, reset the
controllers, and restarted the VFDs. The licensee also determined that the
Unit 3 condensate demineralizer controller had failed simultaneously with
the Unit 3 VFD controllers. The condensate demineralizer primary controller
is a dual redundant programmable logic control (PLC) system connected to the
ethernet-based plant integrated computer system (ICS) network. The VFD
controllers are also connected to this same plant ICS network. Both the VFD
and condensate demineralizer controllers are microprocessor-based utilizing
proprietary software.

The licensee determined that the root cause of the event was the malfunction
of the VFD controller because of excessive traffic on the plant ICS network.
Testing by site personnel performed on the VFD controllers confirmed that
the VFD control system is susceptible to failures induced by excessive
network traffic. The threshold levels for failure of the VFD controllers due
to excessive network traffic, as determined by the on-site testing, can be
achieved on the existing 10-megabit/second network. The NRC staff's review
of industry literature and test reports on network device sensitivity, and
the threshold levels for such failures, confirmed these testing results. The
licensee could not conclusively establish whether the failure of the PLC
caused the VFD controllers to become nonresponsive, or the excessive network
traffic, originating from a different source, caused the PLC and the VFD
controllers to fail. However, information received from the PLC vendor
indicated that the PLC failure was a likely symptom of the excessive network
traffic.

To ensure that excessive network traffic will not cause future Unit 3 VFD
controller malfunctions, the licensee disconnected these devices from the
plant ICS network before restart. The licensee also disconnected the Unit 2
VFD controllers from the plant ICS network.

Licensee corrective actions included (1) developing a network firewall
device that limits the connections and traffic to any potentially
susceptible devices on the plant ICS network and (2) installing a network
firewall device on each unit -- VFD controller and condensate demineralizer
controller. The Browns Ferry Unit 3 event is discussed in Licensee Event
Report 05000296/2006-002, dated October 17, 2006, Agencywide Documents
Access and Management System, Accession No. ML062900106.

The reason the licensee at Browns Ferry investigated whether the failure of
one device, the condensate demineralizer PLC, may have been a factor in
causing the malfunction of the VFD controllers is that there is
documentation of such failures in commercial process control. For instance,
a memory malfunction of one device has been shown to cause a data storm by
continually transmitting data that disrupts normal network operations
resulting in other network devices becoming locked up or nonresponsive. A
network found to be operating outside of normal performance parameters with
a device malfunctioning can effect devices on that network, the network as a
whole, or interfacing components and systems. The effects could range from a
slightly degraded performance to complete failure of the component or
system.  Major contributors to these network failures can be the addition of
devices that are not compatible, network expansion without a procedure and a
overall network plan in place, or the failure to maintain the operating
environment for legacy devices already on the network.

While only non-safety related network devices became nonresponsive at Browns
Ferry Unit 3, it is important to protect both safety-related and non-safety
related devices on the plant network to ensure the safe operation of the
plant. The 19 Aug 2006, transient unnecessarily challenged the plant safety
systems and placed the plant in a potentially unstable high-power, low-flow
condition. The potential safety implications for future similar events would
depend on the type of devices that are connected to the plant ethernet.
Careful design and control of the network architecture can mitigate the
risks to plant networks from malfunctioning devices, and improper network
performance, and ultimately result in safer plant operations.

Subject: Reactors, remotely defended

In *The New York Times*, 25 Apr 2007, a headline (A22, National Edition)
reads 'U.S. Takes Step to Address Airliner Attacks on Reactors'.

The agency was the Nuclear Regulatory Commission; its 'step' was to urge
that reactor designers seek to mitigate the effects of suicide attacks 'to
the extent practicable' -- rather than to aim for 'the capability to
withstand the effects of an aircraft crash.'

'Mitigate' vs 'withstand' is being debated, with one mitigator among the
commissioners citing difficulty in making cost-benefit analyses based on
speculation about probabilities.

The story goes on to say 'By the time new plants are actually built, he
added, the aircraft industry may have solved the problem by installing
equipment to control planes remotely in case of hijacking.'

It may be that the commissioner does not read RISKS.

Subject: Unit confusion caused fatal chemotherapy overdose

The Alberta Cancer Board has released a report into the death of patient
Denise Melanson last August due to an accidental overdose of the
chemotherapy drug fluorouracil.  The prescription gave the dosage as "5,250
mg (at 4,000 mg/m2) intravenous once continuous over 4 days" and then as
"baseline regimen 1,000 mg/m2/day = 4,000 mg/m2/4 days".  The m2 here
apparently refers to the total area of the patient's skin and explained how
the dose in mg had been calculated rather than how it was to be
administered.

To administer the drug, a nurse loaded it into a portable infusion pump.
The drug label would have read "Final Concentration: 45.57 mg/mL; Dose: 5250
mg/4 days (1312.5 mg/24h); Rate: 28.8mL/24h (1.2mL/h)".  The pump had
several options to program the rate of flow, but none of them involved a
rate per day.  The nurse selected milliliters per hour, and recalculated the
rate herself, but forgot to convert days to hours, and typed in the number
for mL/day, which she saw on the label.

For some other drugs 28.8 mL/h would have been a plausible amount, but with
fluorouracil it was fatal.  Another nurse checked the arithmetic, partly
mentally, and did not spot the error.  The problem was only realized when
the drug supply ran out, and then it was too late.  The fact that the pump's
user interface said "mL" when it meant "mL/h" cannot have helped.

The report summarizes the causes as: "miscalculation; opportunity for false
confirmation on label; information required to program pump not part of
medication administration record; double check process failed; complex
workload and multitasking; no feedback from pump; and low knowledge of
hazard."

This is not the first time this sort of thing has happened, and the report
details some of the other ones as well as making recommendations for
improved procedures.

Subject: Error in climate data recording software

Charles Perrow noticed this:

From the latest Nature: 447, p 7140

In 2006, data from the array led a team of scientists to the surprising
conclusion that the world's oceans had cooled during 2003 exceptionally warm
years in terms of global surface temperature. The team published its
findings in Geophysical Research Letters1. Such apparent cooling was seized
on by people keen to highlight the uncertainties in forecasts of global
warming2.

That cooling has now been shown to be an artefact. In some of the buoys --
they are manufactured in separate batches -- a software glitch caused the
temperature and salinity data to be associated with the wrong depths. When
the problem data are excluded from the analysis, the cooling trend drops
below the level of statistical significance.

Subject: Another sat-nav accident: car destroyed, driver escapes

Accepting satellite-navigation directions without sufficient thought has
caused another accident.  A young woman in Great Britain followed its
directions onto a country lane which was blocked by a gate.  At first she
thought it was a dead end, she said, but "the sat nav insisted it was the
correct way so I opened it and drove through."

After the first gate there was a second one, so she got out to close the
first gate and open the second one, apparently not thinking about why there
might be two gates across a road, or why there was a sign saying to proceed
"if the light is green".  (None of the news reports I found says any more
about that light than that the sign existed.)

And while she was out of her car, a train came along the tracks and
demolished it.

Subject: Touch typing

I have long been a fluent touch typist.  I consider Typing to have been the
high-school course that has been most useful during my professional career.

Early this year I started noticing increasing problems with my typing.
Sometimes characters would be dropped.  As many as half of them.  When
things got bad, even if I slowed down and typed a single character at a
time, I lost quite a few.  I was sometimes reduced to a mode of typing a
character, seeing if it appeared on the screen, and then either typing it
again or proceeding to the next character.  I found this quite distressing.

Initially, I thought it might be my keyboard, since I'd fairly recently
acquired a new ergonomic keyboard.  However, swapping the old keyboard back
in didn't help.

I thought maybe I'd done something to mess up my software configuration, but
checking all the settings I could think of that might be relevant didn't
turn up anything out of the ordinary, and none of the changes I tried seemed
to help.  (Deleting Temporary Internet Files did sometimes seem to help a
little bit, as did exiting Internet Explorer and restarting it.)

I found that I had the same problem on both my home and office computers,
which made it seem unlikely that it was a problem with my hardware.

The problem seemed most acute when using Blogger, but checking the Help and
searching the Web turned up no indication that anyone else was seeing this
problem with Blogger.  And it didn't only happen when I was using Blogger.

By this time I had to consider the possibility that the common factor was
me.  My neurologist ran some tests, and concluded that this was NOT
peripheral neuropathy affecting my fingers (although I did have a mild case
of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome that cleared up very quickly wearing wrist splints
at night).

The penny dropped yesterday during a frustrating session creating a new blog
post: I realized that the typing problem had started when I converted to
Internet Explorer version 7, with its feature of "tabbed browsing," which I
rather like.  I typically have four to ten tabs open at any given time, more
when I'm looking for information and links to put into my blog posts.  The
troublesome combination was typing into an IE form (e.g., the Blogger
editor) while having a large number of tabs open.

I quickly tested this by opening a second IE window with only a single tab
for Blogger, leaving the other window on the screen with all its tabs still
open.  Glory be!  I could touch-type at my old speed once again!

It appears that IE 7's input de-multiplexing routine is so inefficient that
it can't reliably keep up with a couple of characters per second when there
are more than about six tabs open, even on a dual-core Pentium D 3.40 GHz
processor with a 1 GB memory!  This seems so preposterous to me that I'm
asking for other IE 7 users to do the experiment and let me know if they see
the same thing; alternatively, perhaps someone else can offer me a better
explanation.

Since those four digits are so useful for authenticating all manner of

Subject: Microsoft sets the wrong time in the PC's real time clock chip

The MS design error and the risk:

Microsoft has always set your PC RTC (realtime clock chip) to the "Local
Time" and not to UTC as unix and others do.

It then applies rules to correct that actual chips RTC time (again and
again) during your daylight saving transitions.

This fundamentally broken idea results in a correction function with two
possible time answers at the time shift boundary overlap.

Hence the ban on rebooting your PC multiple times in such and an overlap
period, as would force multiple time shifts!

However, if the RTC chip stored UTC and applied a UTC local time offset
correction factor, then there is never ambiguity.

Even with VISTA WOW our wizards at Microsoft will apparently not fix this
stupidity as no doubt it would break a few thousand apps.

This is not likely a result of anything you have done.

DST under Windows (all versions) is fundamentally broken. The way they chose
to implement the time change is to adjust *all* dates by one hour when DST is
in effect.

Try this simple test:

  1. Set your system time to the day before a time change.
  2. Create a file and observe the timestamp.
  3. Set your system time to the day after a time change.
  4. Observe the timestamp on your file.

The time stamp will be one hour different after the time change.

This applies to *all* timestamps on *all* your files.

This also applies to *all* the entries in your event logs.

This is by design and is not likely to change. Ever.

This is a know problem (see http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/22.35.html#subj10
for example).

The first statement may be correct but not in the way you mean. The second
statement is correct in general with respect to Windows systems.

I cannot say for certain not having looked at the code but I can only assume
that products such as Outlook/Exchange which do calendaring which must be
correct across time changes have entire libraries of code to deal with this
issue outside of the standard Windows system libraries. Maybe someone who
knows can enlighten the rest of us....
