Subject: Three days of San Francisco BART upgrade crashes

BART has been attempting a software upgrade to modernize the software
controlling its rapid transit system.  Unfortunately, computer system
problems were responsible for a combination of system-wide slowdowns and
shutdowns on three consecutive days (Monday/Tuesday/Wednesday), including
during rush hours.  The first two days' problems resulted from observed
potential safety failures of the new software.  The third day's problems
resulted from an attempt to revert to a backup system -- which apparently
overloaded a network switch, which crashed the computer system.  The new
supposedly self-correcting software had passed all of its tests on the
previous Sunday, but evidently the testing was incomplete.  (This upgrade is
only part of what is thought to be a carefully phased multiyear
modernization that is expected to take at least another five months.)

Subject: Nashville airport X-ray baggage screeners offline: "software glitch"

As reported at www.cnn.com/2006/TRAVEL/03/31/airport.security.ap/index.html:

  A software glitch knocked out the computerized X-ray machines at Nashville
  International Airport for five hours Friday, causing long lines and flight
  delays.

No indication of what the glitch might be.  The article goes on to state:

  David Beecroft, who oversees security operations at Nashville for the
  federal Transportation Security Administration, said all
  U.S. international airports were alerted because the company that supplies
  the software for the Smiths Heimann X-ray detectors also serves several
  other airports.  But TSA spokeswoman Laura Uselding later said other
  airports were not notified because the situation in Nashville was an
  isolated event. The discrepancy could not be immediately resolved.

There are two discrepancies as I see it.  Was this an isolated event or one
that affected screening machines at several airports?  Were several airports
alerted or not?

Also some questions come to mind.  If there was a problem, why would only
*international* airports be alerted (shouldn't domestic baggage be screened
with correctly functioning equipment)?  Were these machines perhaps only
used at intl airports (this isn't clear from the story)?

Subject: IT Corruption in the UK

The 2 Apr 2006 issue of the Sunday Times has an article by the distinguished
journalist Simon Jenkins, 'Desperate Dispatches from the banana republic of
Great Britain'.  There he lists a number of multi-million pound scams.  I
have told him by way of consolation that in the U.S.A. they multi-billions.
Here was one item that he missed!

In a recent *Private Eye* (#1154, 17 March 2005, p.4) we have the following
item, starting:

``How appropriate that Mapeley, the company that does most of its business
through secretive tax havens -- hotbeds of money laundering, terrorist
financing and tax dodging -- should win the contract to manage the 70-odd
`authentication by interview' centres at which the Passport Service will vet
and biometrically test new applicants in the interests of national
security.''

*The Eye* goes on to remind readers of Mapeley's questionable record as
financial manipulators.  For readers of RISKS, it is more interesting that
the UK government has chosen this firm -- which at best has no experience
whatever in the field -- to manage the introduction of a controversial,
untried, rapidly developing and highly sensitive technology.  In that anyone
with the most elementary prudence would recognise that the ID card scheme
will immediately attract hackers, criminals and terrorists to come in on the
ground floor, this contract is evidence for the genuineness of the Blair
government's commitment to security.

Subject: Computer problems with voting system (Danya Hooker)

Computer problems caused the University of Wisconsin-Madison Student Council
to throw out online votes cast this week for campus offices, but retained
votes cast for two referendums on the same ballot.  The cause of the problem
may have been a "little-used, multiple-name tool has worked in prior
elections but may have been corrupted by a database upgrade several months
ago."  The main risk appears to be the lack of testing of the voting system
prior to the vote (along with no testing after a major software upgrade).

The parallels with the world of voting machines are obvious: the voting
system needs to be tested and certified BEFORE voting occurs.

Six thousand votes for Student Council seats will be tossed out, but votes
cast for two referendums will be counted, under a plan approved by the
Associated Students of Madison on Wednesday night.  [...]

knows that you have an eFax or j2 account and knows or guesses the e-mail
address you use with that service, he can send a spate of bogus (or real)

One acquaintance of mine tested this with his j2 account.  No prior
registration for this service was required.  He simply e-mailed as above,
and his account was debited 10 cents and the fax was sent.

There does not seem to be any way to disable e-mail addresses from this
service, for anyone with an eFax or j2 account.  One can, of course, change
the registered e-mail address used with the service, however.

What an accident waiting to happen this is, all in the name of "convenience"!

Subject: Maplin gives "How To..." advice on Wireless Networks

I dropped in to one of my local Maplin (www.maplin.co.uk) stores today.
While standing in the queue, I noticed a leaflet entitled "How to...Create a
wireless network".

It was full of useful information (the 5 most important advantages of a
wireless network are, apparently, no messy cables; no need to drill holes;
simple to expand for more users; the ultimate freedom - Internet anywhere in
your house of garden; no need to open up your PC to install hardware).

Alas, absolutely nothing about the risks of a wireless network, and nothing
on how to secure one. Bear in mind that this is supposedly a "how to...",
not an advert.

They did, however, offer a link (www.maplin.co.uk/wireless) with more
information. When I got back to the office I tried the link, hoping for a
more complete set of instructions dealing with the issues - after all, there
is a limit to what can be put on an A4 sheet.

The further information consisted of the phrase "DETAILS TO FOLLOW...". I
waited for a few minutes just in case there was a flash animation loading or
a page redirect being especially slow. Then I checked the page source. No
flash, no redirect - they just hadn't uploaded the page.

Risks?

1. Pushing technology without due regard to security (a common topic in
   RISKS, alas).
2. Publishing literature with web links in. but not having them ready when
   the literature is released, does not reflect well on a company.

Subject: Rootkit: erosion of terms?

Wearing my "glossary guy" hat, one of the things I've noticed is how
difficult it is to come to complete agreement on the precise definition of
many terms that are used in infosec.  There are, for example, three quite
distinct meanings for the term "tar pit."  (And that's in terms of
networking alone.)  (It is highly unlikely that we will ever be able to
reduce the number of tar pit definitions to one: all the definitions came at
about the same time, and all are important and equally valid.)

However, what really irks me is when defined and agreed upon terms start
being misused, sometimes to the point where the original term becomes
useless.  There is, of course, "hacker."  (And I've given Hal a diatribe
about "zero day" which will probably be coming out in the next ISMH.)

The latest endangered term seems to be "rootkit."  A rootkit has been
defined as programming that allows escalation of privilege or the option to
re-enter the compromised system with greater ease in the future.  Often
rootkits also contain functions that prevent detection of, or recovery from,
the compromise.

Starting with the recent Sony "digital rights management" debacle, the
general media now seems to be using "rootkit" to refer to any programming
that hides any form of information on a system, and specifically any
functions that impede the detection of malware.  The latest reports are that
Bagle and other malware/virus families now contain "rootkits."
Antidetection features in viruses are nothing new: there was a form of
tunneling stealth implemented in the Brain virus 20 years ago.  Therefore,
to use the term rootkit to refer to this activity can only degrade the value
of the term.

It has been difficult to ensure that infosec specialists can at least talk
to each other and exchange useful information.  However, this may not last
much longer if our "precious verbal essences" become contaminated.

  While working on a joint UK / German product development we discovered

Probably because Germans use 'decimal comma' instead of 'decimal

period is used for grouping of digits, i.e. every three digits.

This actually makes perfect sense to me, on both counts. File deletion is
damage, and both the laptop and the data seem to have been the property of
IAC at the time that he chose to destroy the data.

Imagine sacking a developer, and the developer deletes all the source code
he has written during his employment before leaving the building.  Such data
vandalism is justifiable only if you also plan to return all wages paid
during employment, and even then the employer should have the choice.

More over, depending on the terms of the employment contract, Citrin may not
even have had a right to a copy of the data for himself.

While we all speculate on the cause of the error, if the pilots were in

the ground people might want to say to the flight deck crew something like
"Oxygen Now!!" then diagnose the problem.  If the flight deck people had
oxygen (they were by recollection communicating with the ground people),
this might have brought them to their senses so they could solve the
problem.

Subject: The 2005 Helios B737 Crash (Re: RISKS-24.22)

One aspect of the Helios B737 crash not discussed by either Peter Ladkin or
Don Norman (RISKS-24.22) is the relatively short interval available for
the crew to discern the problem and take corrective action.

According to a published accident report
(http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20050814-0) the airplane
climbed from Larnaca airport, at sea level, to 34,000 feet in approximately
19 minutes.  That means an average rate of climb of nearly 1,800 feet per
minute (FPM).  Normally jets climb rapidly from takeoff to 10,000 feet in
order maintain a speed of 250 knots or less, then enter a cruise climb with
higher airspeed and better fuel economy, although air traffic control can
require deviations.  I was unable to find any more detailed information
about the climb profile of this particular flight.

 From the time the cabin altitude alert went off at 12,000 feet
(http://www.ntsb.gov/ntsb/brief2.asp?ev_id=20050825X01309&ntsbno=DCA05RA092&akey=1)
it would take just 6 minutes and 40 seconds to reach 24,000 feet if the
climb rate was 1,800 FPM.

The Time of Useful Consciousness (TUC) at 24,000 feet is at most 3 minutes
(http://www.smartcockpit.com/operations/Surviving%20Cabin%20Decompression.pdf,
http://www.aviationmedicine.co.za/AM_S_Hypoxia.php).  Victims of hypoxia may
be conscious after the TUC but are incapable of taking proper corrective and
protective action, even when instructed or coached.  The TUC is further
reduced by the rate of change of altitude, by increased mental activity,
such as pilot workload in an emergency, and by exercise, such as struggling
out of a cramped cockpit seat to check circuit breakers.

Apparently the captain and co-pilot did not don their oxygen masks when the
cabin altitude alarm sounded.  The "Surviving Cabin Decompression" document
discusses incidents where pilots alerted by an explosive or rapid
decompression lost consciousness after brief delays in donning their masks.
These events are announced by unmistakable cues such as a loud bang and/or
mist forming in the cabin.

The slower loss of pressure as the accident airplane climbed appears to have
allowed hypoxia to develop without these cues.  It would probably take a few
minutes after an initial radio call to base to get qualified engineering
assistance to the microphone.  The fact that neither flight crew member
responded to the Helios engineering department instruction/question
regarding the status of the pressurization panel indicates that hypoxia was
probably far advanced by the time the instruction was given.

In the US, Federal Aviation Regulations require that whenever the airplane
is above 25,000 feet, if one pilot leaves the controls, the other must don
an oxygen mask.  The rules may be different in Greek airspace.  There are
reports (e.g., http://www.airlinesafety.com/editorials/737CrashInGreece.htm)
that this regulation is not always strictly observed.

Had the Helios co-pilot followed this rule when the captain left his seat,
this accident would have been prevented, regardless of the crew's apparent
misunderstanding of the cabin altitude alarm.  Even if he was so trained,
his hypoxia may have prevented him from performing normally.

Most depressurization incidents are resolved without fatal crashes.  This
and other depressurization accidents demonstrate how little time is
available for even fully trained, alert, and competent flight crew to don
their oxygen masks and prevent a tragedy.  The uniqueness of the warning
signal may or may not have played a role in this case; the short interval
between the first indication of trouble and complete incapacitation of the
crew certainly did so.

I am astonished at the underlying safety concept.

It is obvious that climbing with no pressurization and no (crew and
passenger) oygen is fatal.  Then why just issue a "warning"?

I would propose this Basic safety concept: before the system will allow
itself to move into dangerous situations, the pilot must confirm that he is
aware of the specific danger involved.

Implementation for this case: well before attaining a dangerously low cabin
pressure, the autopilot refuses to allow further climbing (even manual)
until the pilots override this barrier by confirming explicitly "we have
donned oxygen".

The same system would - in case of high altitude depressurization -- initiate
an automatic rapid descent until the pilots override it with the same
confirmation.

Credit cards are relatively new things for fast food restaurants.  Just
about every one I've set foot in recently hasn't upgraded its point-of-sale
systems to integrate them beyond adding a "paid by credit" button so there
won't be cash expected in the till.  Card transactions are being handled
separately by VeriFone or similar countertop terminals which have no idea
whether you're selling French fries or Ferraris.

Transactions at countertop terminals do have a bounds check, but it happens
at the wrong point in the transaction.  The customer receipt and store copy
are printed *after* the charge has been committed to the clearing house,
leaving the cardholder with no way to approve the amount.  (Even
restaurants, which have an extra step where you add a gratuity, have this
problem, because the final figure is still un-verified by the customer.)
Even if the customer refuses to consummate the transaction by signing, it's
still a done deal and the only recourse for correcting it is to take it up
with the bank.

I suspect that's what happened in this case, and it's a very good reason to
use a real credit card instead of a debit card.
