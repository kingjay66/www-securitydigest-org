Subject: Half of Norway's banks offline for a week: erroneous keystroke

  http://www.digitoday.no/dtno.nsf/pub/dd20010807092448_er_28707255
(in Norwegian)

This is a mix of abstracting the above article and whatever has been on the
news the last few days, and one or two of my own comments:

EDB Fellesdata AS runs the computer services of about half of Norway's
banks.  On Thursday 2 Aug 2001, they apparently installed about 280 disks in
their Hitachi storage.  Then, instead of initializing the new disks, they
initalized _all_ their disks -- thereby wiping out the entire warehouse.
EDB Fellesdata itself declines to make any statements in the case pending
further contact with their customers, the banks.  They are considering
lawsuits, but if one of their own employees made a "user error", they may
have a hard time of it.

Talk about a lot of eggs in one basket, one can only imagine how many
terrabytes of database this is, considering the number of disks, and how
long it takes to restore from backup, and how many transactions were waiting
to be processed from _other_ banks once the restore is done.  Apparently the
computers were running by Sunday, card services and ATMs were available on
Monday, but Internet banking and automatic-phone-banking access is limited.
They have announced that updated account balances will not be available
until Wednesday, the 7th day after the mishap.  The concerned banks'
customers could pay their bills by visiting a local branch office the whole
time, but apparently the transactions had not been processed because
creditors have been warned that money may be late in arriving (but
presumably retro-credited once the transaction is processed?).

Subject: E-Divorce banned in Singapore

SMS (short-text messaging) enables short messages from one cell phone to
another. Muslim authorities had previously permitted men to divorce their
wives by SMS.  In April to June 2001, 16 divorces were so reported.
However, now the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS), the Syariah
Court and the Registry of Muslim Marriages are "unanimous in their view that
divorce through SMS is unacceptable. ... Only a judge can confirm a divorce
after deciding that there is merit in the complaint filed by the couple with
the Syariah Court."  [Source: Singapore bans text-message divorce, CNET

  [Contributed by Mark Brader.  PGN]

Recently there has been some discussion on AUE of the many fascinating
ways in which the venerable letter-substitution scheme called "rot13"
can be used.  Well, this article may be of some interest:

  http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/comment/0,5859,2800985,00.html

It deals with a certain Russian cryptanalyst who has been jailed for
cracking and exposing the encryption schemes that some electronic book
publishers use to protect their copyrighted properties.  Turns out that one
publisher of industrial reports was using rot13 to protect its valuable (to
the tune of $3,000 a pop) works.

Subject: GA scholarship info exposed

Computer passwords and personal information about participants in Georgia's
HOPE scholarship program were inadvertently exposed on the web as early as
December 2000. The information was apparently cached by several search
engines, including Google. From the *Atlanta Journal Constitution*, 8 Aug
2001, "State staff may feel byte from hackers":

  "Last Nov. 14, he said, a member of the agency's technical staff
  copied a file onto the HOPE computer system that prevents
  Internet search engines from indexing the system's contents.

  But another program in the system deletes unused files after 30
  days, Newsome said. So about Dec. 15, the security file was
  wiped out, exposing other files."

It's not clear what "security file" was accidentally removed. The news
articles I've read about this have not named the file. I'm guessing it was
either robots.txt or .htaccess, hopefully the latter.

Many system administrators have discovered the risks of deleting "unused"
files without being sure of their purpose. Having the procedure happen
automatically compounds the problem.

It was not the kind of "Kodak moment" the city of Lakewood hoped for.  Its

sped through a school zone June 8. Or so it seemed.

After receiving a notice, a thumbnail copy of the incriminating image and a
demand for $71, Mason put pen to paper:

"This is my sworn statement, under penalty of perjury, that your system
cannot distinguish between the sporty coupe shown in the ticket picture, and
the Honda CR-V sport-utility vehicle that I drive. In other words, I swear
that you have the wrong car, since the one shown in the ticket is not my

Abstract: Passport is a protocol that enables users to sign onto many
different merchants' web pages by authenticating themselves only once to a
common server. This is important because users tend to pick poor (guessable)
user names and passwords and to repeat them at different sites. Passport is
notable as it is being very widely deployed by Microsoft. At the time of
this writing, Passport boasts 40 million consumers and more than 400
authentications per second on average. We examine the Passport single signon
protocol, and identify several risks and attacks. We discuss a flaw that we
discovered in the interaction of Passport and Netscape browsers that leaves
a user logged in while informing him that he has successfully logged out.
Finally, we suggest several areas of improvement.

Subject: More Adobe plastering (Re: Maggard, RISKS-21.56)

In RISKS-21.56, Michael Maggard writes, "...Adobe has been installing a
mysterious file of their own that regularly 'calls home' for reasons
unknown."

Perhaps this kind of reporting software is necessary, but it may be the
reason why I'm slowly giving up on Adobe products. My version of InDesign
crashes frequently. My version of ImageReady has the strangest bug. If my
system has been up for a bit, ImageReady refuses to run. If I reboot, it's
fine. I suspect this has something to do with the quick blip of the network
access LED on the router that flickers just after starting up. Maybe that
little phone-home program doesn't say the right thing to ImageReady. I
thought about complaining or investigating, but I decided that making the
transition to GIMP is simpler.

This topic has been on my mind while I've been working on creating simple
watermarks for a pay-per-copy experiment. (See
http://www.flyzone.com/satstory/ or just end $.75 to satstory@flyzone.com
for a copy of a story on DirecTV hacking) I considered complicated
encryption mechanisms and gave up. The complexity took too long to develop
and excluded too many legitimate customers. In the end, I just insert the
purchaser's name in the file on the way out the door.

This kind of watermark may be easy to defeat, but that has
advantages. First, bright kids get no boost from hacking the system.  It's
trivial. But it is still complex enough to require someone to take a
positive step to defeat it. If they can live with themselves, well, they'll
get enough punishment. Finally, there is no complexity to crash systems and
drive users nuts.

%T   "Computer Security Handbook, Third Edition"

Overall, this work appears to be strongly influenced from a time when
computers were mainframes locked in glass rooms, and the information
technology department was under the jurisdiction of accounting.  Although
some effort has been made to address more recent topics, the attempt is
piecemeal at best, and quite limited in depth.

Part one looks at the responsibility of management in the security concern.
The first essay, specifying the role of management, certainly dates the work
in the big iron era, defining security solely from the perspective of
availability.  Disclosure of information does get a mention, but even the
list of risks to be considered concentrates primarily on malfunction or
disaster.  A second paper takes a rather vague look at policies and related
documents, but is backed up with a number of examples.  The review of risk
analysis is similarly nebulous, although it does have some potentially
useful tables of probable threats.  Optimism about the availability of
background information seems to surround the discussion of employee
policies, but some important basic principles are presented.  Legal issues
are dealt with briefly, but over a wide range of topics.  The article on
computer crime is not particularly realistic: as one example, the
examination of controls concentrates on provisions for preventing
programmers from installing logic bombs, but the case studies actually cited
as examples of the need for such controls were perpetrated as fraud by those
in positions of authority.

Part two outlines basic safeguards.  Disaster recovery is, again, reviewed
primarily from the mainframe perspective.  The principles may be the same,
but the important resources for a corporation probably involve many more
aspects than just a mainframe and data.  An overview of insurance sounds
very much like a sales pitch, although it does divide the topic up by type
of threat, and examines different factors that can affect price and the
willingness of the insurers to make good on a loss.  (I was amused to note
that the section on viruses basically admits that vendors will use
extraordinary interpretations of standard wording to weasel out of paying.)
The chapter on auditing appears to have been written solely from an
accounting perspective, and, while the points listed would be helpful in
creating part of a security policy, they address only those issues related
to internal fraud.  System application controls are discussed strictly in
terms of development cycles and ideas such as "total quality management"
(TQM).

Part three moves to physical protection.  Hardware protection takes a
detailed look at internal error situations right down to the gate level, as
well as a more superficial examination of architecture concerns and
environmental problems.  Accidental calamities are also the major emphasis
in computer facility protection, although there is some attention paid to
the need to secure cabling.  "Monitoring and Control Devices" presents
theory behind surveillance and alarm systems.

Part four starts to look into technical aspects of data security.  A chapter
on software and information security appears to have some valid points to
make (aside from the misinformation on viruses) but is written in such a
convoluted manner that most material must be read several times to puzzle
out the meaning.  An essay on records retention has been retrofitted to
become an examination of computer data security.  The paper on encryption is
extremely disjointed (for example, dropping a discussion of network
topologies into a purported explanation of the RSA [Rivest Shamir Adleman]
encryption algorithm), and almost completely lacking in details.  A rather
generic security overview (with questionable virus information) is supposed
to address data communications and networking.  A grab bag of penetration
techniques and countermeasures provides some interesting prompts to consider
various attacks, but is not organized or complete enough to fully cover the
subject.  The chapter on viruses and related threats is rife with errors,
and confuses the various types of problems with each other as well as with
unverified speculation.

Part five deals with special protection issues.  Chapter twenty suggests
that you might want to be a little careful when dealing with outside
contractors.  While there is some disorganization, and a few odd
anachronisms, the paper on personal computers is much more practical than
most of the preceding material.  The essay on LANs presents a primer on
networks, and then a generic overview of security, without an awful lot of
relation between the two.  The chapter on Internet security has some basic
information, but is quite disorganized.

Supplements are supposedly produced to update the work.  Some such documents
ask you to replace paragraphs and correct errors: others offer additional
sections to enhance the original essays.  In the 1997 supplement (ISBN
0-471-17297-9) there are some weak addenda for auditing, encryption, and
viruses, as well as a decent, though still disorganized, extension to the
Internet material.  There is also a first rate examination of e-mail privacy
issues and a reasonable though uninspired review of single sign-on.  When I
contacted the publisher, I was told that the 2000 supplement was still in
the editorial stage.  In fact, so was the 1998 supplement!  So I wouldn't
expect any updates for the book in the near future.

Most of the material is fairly obviously old, and originally intended to
address topics applicable solely to mainframe computer establishments, or
even non-computerized systems.  Patchwork updating is evidently an
afterthought.  A great deal of material is repeated many times over in
different essays.  Generally the papers have little detail or depth, so the
recapitulations do not add much new content each time.

There is useful material in the work, but it is difficult to abstract the
good from the outdated and mundane unless you are already quite expert in
the field.  The newcomer would be advised to get some basic training or
reading before attempting to deal with this work, but the expert will be
able to find some useful nuggets.
