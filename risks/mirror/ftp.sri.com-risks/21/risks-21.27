Subject: Stockholm power outage hits high-tech companies

As reported in various Swedish media, including *Dagens Nyheter*
(http://www.dn.se/), Mar 12, 2001:

A fire in a tunnel containing power cables caused a long-lasting
blackout for 50,000 people and a large number of high-tech companies
in several Stockholm suburbs. The incident happened on Sunday
morning, and utility company officials hoped that customers
would have power again late Monday evening.

The largest employer in the area, Ericsson, told 11,000 employees to stay at
home Monday as their workplace had no power. IBM did the same thing for
their 2,000 employees.

The blackout also caused problems with other depending services, such as
water, heating, landline phones, mobile phones, pagers, Internet traffic and
servers, and public transportation. Police and fire departments have been
busy with burglaries (no lights or alarms working), fires (caused by candles
and even indoor BBQs) and black traffic lights.

A spokesperson for the utility company Birka Energi says: "The cable damage
is total. We cannot handle it with normal rerouting, because all the cables
were destroyed."

All the cables in one tunnel, that is.  Did anyone mention eggs and baskets?

Subject: New USB Army 'Land Warrior' tech connects the next cybertoys

Apparently TransDimsensions is a defense contractor that is using a version
of USB (Universal Serial Bus) (and Bluetooth) as the basis for the
"Soldier-of-the-future" project. I can understand that some of the promised
peripherals are "cool" and even useful. But one of the major lessons of the
Internet is the power of the "end-to-end" approach that puts the onus on the
end points to provide reliability. Bus architectures like USB provide a
reliable and synchronous transport that is the basis for brittle designs
that have little resilience. Unlike the Internet where each participant
takes responsibility for quenching failures, in USB creates dependencies in
which failures propagate.  Of course USB also has the problem of not having
an addressing structure for peer connectivity beyond a very local scale.

The problem is that stories about the soldier of the future are very glitzy
and that it is easy to claim one needs a reliable networking technology such
as USB rather than an imperfect one like IP. But that's like saying that you
can't risk exposing children to germs because they might get sick. It works
fine until the children are deployed (become adults). At that point they
have no survivability.

Subject: In Japan, do trains check for drivers?

I thought checking for a driver on computerized trains was routine.  They
must not have deadman switches on Japan's bullet trains (Shinkansen).  A
driver left his seat to search for his misplaced hat -- because the company
rules state that he must have his hat on at all times.  Fortunately, (1) the
train was going in the neighborhood of 15 miles per hour at the time, and
(2) there were no passengers at the time.  Drivers have now been informed
that if they misplace their hat, they should continue to the next station.

Subject: UCITA implements DoS and DDoS Vulnerabilities

Ed Foster's "The Gripe Line" Column in the 5 Mar 2001 issue of *Infoworld*
(www.infoworld.com) raises a pair of interesting Denial of Service (DoS) and
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack vulnerabilities.  He says:

  Foremost among the perils posed by UCITA is the "electronic self help"
  section that allows software publishers to equip their programs with
  remote disabling capabilities.

Think about this in terms of a DoS vulnerability. The vendor may say that
the capability is disabled for software bought with a Commercial bulk
license.  For example, Microsoft has indicated that they disable this
"feature" for their bulk license sales.  However, how can a DoD/Commercial
user with a very critical application be sure that the process that disabled
the remote disabling capability can't be circumvented?  Consider the
motivation an adversary would have for software used in critical DoD
applications.

In another section of his Column, Ed commented (*Italics* added by Warren
Pearce):

  A perfect example is the service agreement posted by Juno in January,
  particularly the section in which Juno claims the right to use its
  customers' computers during their downtime to run its own "Computational
  Software".  Juno's service agreement states, "In connection with
  downloading and running the Computational Software, Juno may require you
  to leave your computer turned on at all times. ... *You expressly permit
  and authorize Juno to initiate a telephone connection from your computer
  to Juno's central computers, ... and you agree that, as between you and
  Juno, you shall be responsible for any costs and expenses resulting from
  the foregoing."* ... As has been widely reported, in February Juno
  announced its Virtual Supercomputer Project, which will harness its
  customers' unused CPU cycles to sell as a *distributed computing service.*

Think about *distributed computing service* as *distributed DDoS service*.
Consider *"You expressly permit and authorize Juno to initiate a telephone
connection from your computer to Juno's central computers"* and you have
only one telephone line to your house. This indicates that Juno can occupy
this line at their volition? Hope you don't need to make a 911 call!!!  The
user *shall be responsible for any costs and expenses.* The lawyers and Juno
will have fun after the DDoS attack.

Subject: Mistaking list for scalar context brings cops

A high-school sophomore last week was called to his private school's office
and asked to explain some suspicious text on his Web site.  What was
intended to be a quote from /usr/games/fortune was instead the *first line*
from its output.  The school staff was very alarmed because the full output
would have been:

   I put the shotgun in an Adidas bag and padded it out with four
   pairs of tennis socks, not my style at all, but that was what I
   was aiming for:  If they think you're crude, go technical; if they
   think you're technical, go crude.  I'm a very technical boy.  So I
   decided to get as crude as possible.  These days, though, you have
   to be pretty technical before you can even aspire to crudeness.
   - Johnny Mnemonic, by William Gibson

Using a variable in list context on the left side of a perl expression
puts the right side into the same context, and many operators behave
differently in different contexts.  These two statements are not
equivalent:

   my $f  = `fortune`; # returns fortune as scalar, stores in $f
   my($f) = `fortune`; # returns each line of fortune as one element
                       # in a list, stores first line in $f

Only the line about the shotgun in the Adidas bag made it to this kid's Web
page, and the school went into crisis mode.  They called the police just to
be on the safe side.

http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/03/13/208259

Everything was eventually explained to their satisfaction, but the cops
still talked to this sophomore and his father for a couple of hours and
they're keeping his name on file... again, "just in case."

The risk is, I think, being a private high-school student a week after a
high-profile school shooting, and having a Web site.

(Given that there seemed to have been no way, for example, to add or

Mr. Schneier is, of course, quite correct. And, as far as I am concerned,
his observation, above, should be printed on almost every computer security
product marketed today --- something like the Surgeon General's warning on
tobacco products.  It is also worth remembering that even *real* air gaps
cannot totally prevent the leakage of sensitive information (or, in theory,
going the other direction, possible attacks).  An air gap might reduce
covert channel bandwidth dramatically, but it cannot reduce that bandwidth

And not only soldiers.  Though the "smarts" are of a different variety (user
authentication versus targeting), the probable faults of so-called "smart
guns" are a hot topic within the gun control debate.  Even setting aside the
question of civilians, would you want police (who are more often shot with
their own guns than any other, in the USA), never mind the military, armed
with such technology?  Some designs deactivate the gun if the battery dies;
soldiers may maintain their weapons well (even in peacetime, for fear of
discipline), but police (at least here in the USA) are infamous for not
doing so.  Many designs are even susceptible to jamming signals easily
generated with a handheld device (which of course will be a hot item, so to
speak, among criminals).  Some require punching in a code in order to
activate the gun... and of course the keypads (another point of failure)
have to be small (to fit) and difficult to depress (to avoid false presses
during normal handling), so the chances of fumbling under the stress of
having your life in immediate danger are greatly magnified.  The list of
risks goes on....

Independent of whether the weapons are being oversold, I find myself writing
to RISKS yet again to point out the meaninglessness of the statistics cited.
Consider first of all the word "most," used presumably because it sounds
impressive. If you read the BBC article you discover that what they mean:
"bombs hit fewer than 50% of the targeted radars." So if 49% of the bombs
hit, "most" of them missed.

Now consider "fewer than 50%" as a bomb hit rate. Is that great, ok, or
terrible? Right, you don't know.

Third, it's a doubly meaningless statistic. One relevant point is, compared
to what? The comment in 21.26 claimed in passing that they "have been little
more effective than plain dumb bombs." Really? What's the accuracy of plain
dumb bombs? Is it 49%? No doubt some folks in the audience actually know the
answer to that and can supply it, but the BBC report didn't say and neither
did the Risks posting.

The second half of the meaninglessness is that accuracy isn't measured as
hit or miss; bombs (and missiles) don't have to hit the target to be
effective.  Sometimes 2000 pounds of explosive going off in even the general
neighborhood is quite enough.

One standard measure is "circular error probable," a circle within which 50%
of the bombs would fall. The relevant statistic is the size of that
circle. One source indicates that in WWII, "more than half the bombs dropped
missed their targets by well over 1000 yards"
(http://www-cgsc.army.mil/usaf/Pubs/Enemysytem.htm), i.e., they fell more
than _half a mile_ from the target. How much better is conventional bombing
now, and how do the smart bombs compare? That would be an interesting set of
numbers.

In the absence of the relevant numbers and relevant comparison points, the 
widely repeated "more than 50%" is simply meaningless, no matter how 
melodramatic it sounds.

Subject: Re: SETI@Home felled by a single point of failure (Pack, RISKS-21.26)

If there had been a (lower speed) backup link we could have applied
rate limits to the SETI@Home traffic, to keep it from swamping the
link.  Granted, this may have been almost indistinguishable from
blocking the SETI@Home data server altogether, but it would have
allowed other SSL net traffic to get through.

> LBNL and SSL are cut off from the 'Net altogether until this SPF is

This is only partly true.  The severed cable connected LBNL to the UC
Berkeley campus.  LBNL has other connections to the Internet, so they were
not completely cut off.  SSL and the Lawrence Hall of Science are
administratively and topologically part of UC Berkeley, even thought LBNL
lies between them and the rest of campus.  They *were* completely cut off
from the net for about 5 days.

> ... drop-out rate may increase as people simply give up instead of
> checking the home page for an explanation for their lack of progress.

I don't have any information on drop-outs, but the data volume has returned
to normal levels since the cable was repaired, so I'd guess the impact was
minimal.  The disruption to the everyday business of SSL and LHS was
undoubtedly much worse than the overall effect on the SETI@Home data
processing.

There were some interesting side effects.  SETI@Home has a LOT of users.
Even though only a tiny fraction went to the trouble of looking up contact
information for UC Berkeley, we were getting a steady stream of e-mail
queries asking why SETI@Home was off the air.  We redirected their Web
server traffic to that status page in order to cut down on the number of
queries.

The redirection had the intended effect.  However, we used one of our
standard Web page templates for the status page.  The template includes some
links to our own Web pages, such as the one for job listings in our
department.  So that's why we saw a big increase (an order of magnitude) in
the number of employment inquiries during the outage.

Even if they had a backup line, it's very likely that it was bundled in the

Subject: Re: When will they EVER learn? (Kuenning, RISKS-21.25)

We had the other side of this problem at our site.

We generate and e-mail an initial random string password to ensure that a
user has at least supplied us with one piece of valid, somewhat traceable,
information.

Since we have no choice but to send it back in e-mail we did NOT include the
login name, which the user has chosen themselves, in that e-mail.

Thus, if the e-mail was seen (we figure there is more chance of it been seen
on the office printer than by a sniffer) at least one essential element was
still missing.

Well, what happened next was that customer service started getting e-mail
and calls from users who could not recall what login name they had selected!

I should add that the password is generated and e-mailed immediately, and
will normally arrive in someone's inbox no more than a minute after they
complete the sign up.

We have also had to gradually reduce the efficacy of the random string, as
customer service requested we eliminate numbers and mixed case because of
the number of calls they fielded because of "shiftkeyanemia".

Our site only serves professional bond traders, investment managers, bankers
and such. Not the general public.

Neither do they on a Psion Series 3 or 5 if you have left the serial link

device in full if the serial link has been left online.  And I don't think
I'd need to point at the obvious risk of storing your data on removable

However, there is hope here: you can always protect the individual files by
running a crypto program over it - whilst accepting that PDA security could
