"Emergency lines went dead for six minutes shortly after 1am [on Wednesday,

callers rang during the critical period, noone could have sought assistance
had there been an emergency. ... In case of power failure, the call centres
have a diesel generator. But Mr Bahr [technical representative for the

Subject: Security advisories becoming less open?

Recently there has been some discussion on BUGTRAQ regarding some companies
attempts to change the way they publish security advisories.

Some background:
http://www.securityportal.com/list-archive/bugtraq/2000/Dec/0036.html
http://www.securityportal.com/list-archive/bugtraq/2000/Dec/0042.html

http://www.securityportal.com/list-archive/bugtraq/2000/Dec/0076.html
http://www.securityportal.com/list-archive/bugtraq/2000/Dec/0101.html

Basically, it started when Microsoft abruptly switched to a new advisory 
format where the notification e-mail included only a cursory description 
of the problem and a [malformed] URL for the actual report. Today, Elias 
Levy announced that @Stake wanted to switch to a format with more 
information in the message but still requiring a visit to their website 
for the full advisory.

Some interesting RISKS:

  - Access for people with marginal Internet connections or browsers other
    than IE/Netscape is less convenient.

  - Information is unavailable if the webserver is down or overloaded, as
    might happen with an important advisory. It seems counterproductive to
    put important, time-sensitive material behind a single point of failure,
    particularly when the decision is to deliberately avoid using a free
    distributed, fault-tolerant distribution channel.

  - It makes it much easier for a vendor to change an advisory without
    notifying anyone, especially since changed or removed advisories won't
    be archived in anywhere near as many places as a mailing list such as
    BUGTRAQ. In addition to covering up bad work, this would also make it
    easier to remove or tone-down past advisories about companies the author
    is now aligned with.

  - It opens the prospect of tailoring content to the reader. This could be
    as simple (and annoying) as charging for access to some content or as
    complex as determining what to show based on where the request came from
    (e.g. competitors, vendors or journalists).  While this would probably
    be caught for something major, particularly at first, it would not
    surprise me to find at least subtle tampering happening regularly if
    this becomes commonplace.

I find it hard to ignore the above concerns given that the switch 
provides no benefits of any sort to the reader, let alone enough benefit 
to outweigh them. The only legitimate advantage from such a policy is 
that it makes it easier for the author to change the contents of a 
released advisory. For legitimate purposes, this is unnecessary:

  - Updates to current advisories can be published in the same fashion as
    the originals, ensuring that anyone who received the original will
    receive any updates.

  - It's extremely easy to add a link to the advisory which people could use
    to check for updates.

  - It discourages the use of proper change control, since it's easier to
    update an existing advisory than release a update.

  - It will cause old links to break if they ever move content 
    around and neglect to install a redirect for the old URL. 
    (Microsoft is notorious for this, especially with links that break 
    only for visitors using something other than Internet Explorer)

To: BUGTRAQ@SECURITYFOCUS.COM

One thing that I noticed about the new Microsoft security bulletins is that
they now contain Web bugs.  The bugs look like they are used to count the
number of people coming to read the bulletins.  Here is the URL for one of
these bugs:

http://c.microsoft.com/trans_pixel.asp?
source=www&TYPE=PV&p=technet_security_bulletin

I didn't see a <IMG> tag for the bug, so I'm assuming it is generated by one
of the JavaScript files included on the page.

One thing that Microsoft is learning here is what bulletins people consider
important.  With the older format, where all the info was in an e-mail
message, they did not get this feedback.

I don't see the use of Web bugs here as a big deal, but still interesting.

Subject: Making something look hacked when it isn't

A brief e-mail has been getting forwarded around our campus which reads:
  Check out breaking news at CNN:
  http://www.cnn.com&story=breaking_news@18.69.0.44/evarady/www/top_story.htm

At first glance, this appears to be a genuine article on CNN, but a quick
read reveals that a cute joke.  Most people who have seen the fake article
have immediately assumed that www.cnn.com has been hacked in some manner.

Those more familiar with HTTP specification, however, will notice that the
URL is completely valid, and does not lead to or redirect from any cnn.com
computers.  No machines have been hacked.  Instead, the e-mail just plays
with your expectations of what a URL should look like.  The risk here is not
a computer one at all, but a social risk that even (or perhaps especially)
knowledgeable people will assume something has been hacked when it hasn't
been.

An even sneakier URL might be:
  http://www.cnn.com&story=breaking_news@306511916/evarady/www/top_story.htm

For those of you still pondering why that URL works, read the HTTP
spec and try the equivalent:
  http://username@18.69.0.44/evarady/www/top_story.htm

Subject: The risk of a seldom-used URL syntax

Recently, a mailing list I'm on forwarded a report of a "hack" of the
CNN.com site.  Upon looking closely, I found that the CNN site hadn't
been hacked at all -- it was the *minds* of readers of this hoax "report"
that were being hacked! Rather cute, actually, but it exposes what is
perhaps a larger RISK, so please bear with me while I set up the story...

An MIT student named Eric Varady took a parody news article from
The Onion <URL:http://www.theonion.com/onion3637/bush_horrified.html>,
edited the layout to resemble CNN's format, and copied it to his own site
<URL:http://salticus-peckhamae.mit.edu/evarady/www/top_story.htm>.
(Note that multiple threatened legal actions have since forced him
to remove the original content, but an explanation page is still there.)

He then passed around a "report of a hack of the CNN site" with a URL
[which I *do* hope makes it through the mail-to-HTML scripts at Catless!] of
<URL:http://www.cnn.com&story=breaking_news@18.69.0.44/evarady/www/top_story.htm>.

If you look very closely, you'll see that the actual host named by this URL
is not "www.cnn.com", but "18.69.0.44" (a.k.a. salticus-peckhamae.mit.edu).
That is, for IP-based/Internet URL "schemes" such as HTTP or FTP, the
general format defined in RFC 1738 is:

    <scheme>://[<user>[:<password>]@]<host>[:<port>]/<url-path>

The "user" field is very rarely used, and even then is more often seen with
FTP than HTTP. But since it contained an at-sign before the first slash,
the hoax URL was really <URL:http://18.69.0.44/evarady/www/top_story.htm>
with the (ignored) user field of "www.cnn.com&story=breaking_news". Cute, eh?

More serious scams of this sort are possible, given the number of users
who (1) have *no* idea what the formal syntax of a URL is, and (2) routinely
access the Web through "portals" which often create complicated indirection
URLs to aid with logging or tracking to support advertising revenue, e.g.:
<URL:http://www.foo.bar.com/logger.cgi?http://www.other.place.com/some_article>

The RISK is that users are being bombarded with these monstrosities so
often that they've grown used to it, and that they'll fail to recognize
when they're being sent someplace they might not really want to go!!
(Perhaps when it's not a joke, such as being sent to a porn site while
working at a company with a "no tolerance" policy.)

From: djb0x77376989@scream.org (Dan Birchall)
Subject: Intelligence risks of e-mail auto-responses

For some time, I have been associated with organizations that maintained
e-mail lists for communication with customers.  Each customer mailing
generates some quantity of e-mail responses to the mailing address or a
specified reply-to address.  Heuristic filters handle the most frequent
types of responses, generating automatic replies or redirecting mail to
appropriate addresses.  There are, though, always some messages which the
filters can't adequately handle, so my involvement tends to involve
eyeballing them.

The workload is by no means immense - for every 6,000 outbound messages
sent, I manually handle one response.  Some are questions the filters didn't
catch, which I pipe to various scripts.  Some are bounce messages.  Some are
chain letters - I grep those for From: headers and bounce them to the
appropriate administrators; nothing to spread holiday cheer like a corporate
policy smackdown.  A good many are auto-responses.

Within the set of auto-responses, a significant minority pose non-technical
risks.  Users who are going to be "away from mail" or "out of the office"
for even a single day frequently leave instructions on who should be
contacted in their absence, and their responses often include other
information that could be considered sensitive.

Their expectation is, of course, that they will receive mail from co-workers
and colleagues who already know where they work, what they do, and have some
need for the information.  However, if they are subscribed to mailing lists,
it is quite possible that the information they provide will be seen by
completely unrelated users at other organizations.

  "I will be away from [government laboratory] from [departure date]
  and will return on [return date].  If you need to reach someone
  from the IT Security staff, Please contact [coworker] at [number]
  or e-mail to [address]."

Congratulations.  You've just told me what department you work in and where
you work (the combination of which might not be the sort of thing you don't
just go blabbing around), and given me a co-worker's name and direct contact
information.  The potential for a social engineering hack is giddying.

This is, of course, a somewhat extreme example.  But for each one like this,
there are hundreds of others from people in business, academia and
government.  People who're perfectly willing to send total strangers
information about their personal schedules - who they are, what they do,
where they do it, when they're leaving, when they're coming back, where
they're going, how they can be reached while they're gone, or who to contact
instead.

Perfectly normal information to give to a co-worker, colleague or neighbor.
Somewhat risky information to give to strangers, in an era of competitive
intelligence, corporate and other espionage, etc.

Workarounds?  You could hack your MTA/MUA/MDA to only send responses to
certain domains, or omit all personal information from your auto-response.
A more balanced approach would involve not re-stating information authorized
users already know, and delivering necessary information in a minimal form.
Ergo, instead of:

  "I will be away from GovLab from December 22 and will return on 
  December 26.  If you need to reach someone from the IT Security 
  staff, Please contact John Smith at 809-555-1212 or e-mail to 
  jsmith@govlab.gov."

send something like this:

  "I am currently away from work.  If you need to reach someone, 
  please contact John <jsmith> at 555-1212."

The logic, of course, is that an authorized person already knows
where you work, what you do, your e-mail domain, and your area code.
Nobody needs to know how long you'll be gone, if there's someone
else who can help them.

One of the aspects of the American election that is very strange to someone
used to the British election process is that so many different votes are
made on the same ballot paper. If one ballot paper is used for each vote
then the counting process can be made much simpler, faster, and more
reliable. The ballots can be quickly split into piles per candidate, and
then those piles can be counted in parallel.  Votes for different issues can
also be counted in parallel. Separate "ambiguous" piles can be examined more
closely if necessary.

This also means that statewide elections can use the same ballot paper
across the state without affecting the need for counties or cities to have
their own ballots for their own elections.

Subject: Re: ATM network for voting: a non-starter (Jefferson, RISKS-21.15)

David Jefferson's well thought out critique of ATM-based voting misses
one small but important point.  Depending on where you live, it is not
necessary to provide any authentication, or even to sign, in order to
vote.  Until this year, in Virginia all I had to do was state my name
and address to the election official, and that was sufficient.  Given
the number of voters in each precinct (thousands in a presidential
election), it's likely that I could have voted several times using a
different (valid) name each time.  If I knew the names and addresses of
people in other precincts, I could therefore vote for them as well.  

The law changed this year, and now you either have to present some form
of picture ID, or you must sign an affidavit.  But they don't have a
signature to compare to at the voting booth, so in the best case they
find out after the fact that *someone* voted illegally (but they can't
tell which vote it was).

I mention this because all of the discussions about electronic voting
(ATM-based, Internet-based, or otherwise) presuppose a requirement for
strong authentication.  If we're trying to model the paper world, that's not
necessarily so.  [Recognizing, of course, that there's not enough time to
vote 1000 times in the same day in the paper world, under the assumption
that I'd have to rotate between precincts to escape detection, but I can
certainly vote electronically 1000 times in the same day.]

We've heard this mentioned repeatedly in discussions about online voting.
I don't know how voting works in your community, but there's virtually no
authentication in my town.  I go to the polling place, they ask me my name
and address, and they cross it off the voter list; another person does the
same thing when I turn in the completed ballot.  None of the people there
know me, yet they never ask for any proof of identity.  A teenager trying
to get into a bar at least has to have a fake ID; he wouldn't need that to
vote as someone else -- all the information he needs is in the phone book.

However, if I tried to vote multiple times in the same precinct I suspect
they would recognize me.  So in order to stuff the ballot, I would have to
go to different precincts, which would be quite tedious.  With an
electronic system, the door is opened to massive fraud by a single
individual.

Subject: Re: ATM network for voting: a non-starter (Jefferson, RISKS-21.15)

There's only one positive feature to using the ATM network for voting, which
is that you can pay bribes to voters right on the spot.  Other than that,
it's totally impractical - ATMs use common physical formats for cards and
for currency, but they don't have common processors, programming
environments, network protocols, or user interfaces, and the real
interoperation is done by the host processors that feed the networks and
common banking standards, not because there's any interoperation out at the
edges.

Most of them use some variant on SNA, which was relatively appropriate
technology at the time ATM networks started evolving, and are some variant
on a PC - I've seen Dead-MSDOS messages on out-of-order ATMs, some have run
OS/2, some Unix, while others probably have custom or other production
operating systems.

My (equally sardonic) comment is about the original (hidden) assumption 
that one can somehow compare chip error rates with software error rates.  I 
was not aware that there was a published conversion factor converting 
transistors to lines of code.  Perhaps I'm using the wrong metric and it's 
errors per pound of silicon that can be converted somehow to an equivalent 
in errors per line of source code.  In any case, I'll bet if we first 
converted lines-of-code to pixels-to-display-a-line-of-code, software and 
hardware error rates would start to look a lot more similar.

Subject: Re: Another DMV Break-in, in Oregon (PGN, RISKS-21.15)

In the mid 1990s, Pitney-Bowes developed and demonstrated a system for
digitally-signed drivers licenses. I believe that the system was called
VERITAS, but I could be wrong. The system provided for a 2D barcode on the
back of each driver's license. The barcode contained a digitized copy of the
driver's photograph, name, address, height, age, etc. The 2D barcode was
signed with the digital key of the day, which itself was signed with the
system key. I believe that the system key was changed every year.

The company's business plan, I believe, was to basically give away the
identity systems to state governments and then to sell verifiers to stores,
restaurants, bars, etc. You would slap a person's driver's license down onto
the verifier and it would display their photograph and tell you if they were
old enough to drink, etc. It would also verify the signature.

The Pitney-Bowes system was specifically designed to prevent the
break-in-and-steal-it problem. Each morning the systems in the field would
call up and get their key-of-the-day signs by the system-key. If a system
was stolen, those systems wouldn't get signed. If they actually issued
fraudulent cards, you could blacklist those cards and distribute the
blacklist to the verifiers. You could even use caller ID to make sure that
you wouldn't issue certs the phone number it was calling from wouldn't match
the caller ID, and the system wouldn't issue a key.

I saw this system at the RSA conference in 1993 or 1994. I was quite
impressed. But Pitney-Bowes never sold it. I believe that there was a patent
infringement problem.

I find this highly implausible.  I could perhaps accept a claim that
these systems are very secure, but to say that _no one_ has _ever_
gained unauthorized entry strains credibility.  How does Mr. Martin
know this?  More to the point, how could _anyone_ know this?  In the

If nothing else, authorized users can be bribed, coerced, or fooled by
"social engineering".

Using the "latest" hardware and software does _not_ boost my confidence
in "extraordinary" security.

Some of the RISKs here:
* Wildly over-optimistic claims like these suggest that (as usual)
  management is pretty clueless when it comes to computer security.
* Managers who actually believe the systems are _perfect_ don't have much
  incentive to improve them, or even examine/audit them too closely...
* Line employees who might actually be very competent are more likely
  to quit when confronted with pointy-headed bosses.
* And oh yes, the UW statement was right: claiming "our systems have
  never had unauthorized access" probably _does_ boost the chances
  of further attacks.
