Subject: Did a human factors problem affect the U.S. presidential election?

The outcome of the U.S. Presidential election may have been determined by
poor human factors in a computerized vote-casting system.

As of this writing (early afternoon on Wednesday), Bush and Gore are
separated by less than 1800 votes (.03%) in Florida.  Due to the arcana of
U.S. election law, whoever carries Florida at this point will win the
overall election.  And there's a problem in one county that may have
resulted in ~3000 votes that were intended for Gore in fact being cast for
Buchanan, a minor party candidate.

Palm Beach County uses a punch-card voting system.  Because of the layout of
the names relative to the holes and the buttons to punch those holes, it was
apparently easy to get confused about how to vote for Gore.  Apart from all
the calls to the election board by confused voters, there is circumstantial
evidence from the actual tally: Buchanan drew 3407 votes in this county,
more than anywhere else in the state, and considerably at variance with both
the usual demographics (this county is heavily Democratic, and would be
expected to vote for Gore) and with the number of votes Buchanan received in
similar, neighboring, larger counties (789 in Broward; 561 in Miami-Dade
County).

The director of the state Department of Elections doesn't think there's a
problem -- but he was appointed by Jeb Bush, governor of Florida and brother
of the Republican presidential candidate...

Subject: More on Florida in this and previous elections

In addition to the Palm Beach County curiosity noted by Steve Bellovin, a
heavily loaded ballot lock box was found today in a heavily Democratic
precinct.  I don't think this is what Al Gore meant by a "Lock Box on (Social)
Security."

  [CORRECTION ADDED IN ARCHIVE COPY: Apparently this box contained
  supplies, not ballots.  But *The NY Times* 10 Nov noted various 
  precincts in which ballot boxes and a bag of cards had not been 
  included in the original count.] 

For some historical perspective, we might recall the 1988 election in
Florida, in which there were 200,000 fewer votes for the Senate race than
for the presidential candidates, and the remarkable anomaly was mostly only
in four counties administered by a particular computer system vendor.  The
declared winner was Connie Mack, who has just retired, 12 years later.  See
*The New York Times*, 12 Nov 1988, and RISKS-7.78.

And then there was the St Petersburg city election in March 1993 in which
1429 votes were recorded for the incumbent mayor tabulated under an
industrial precinct that had ZERO voters, where the mayor won the election
by 1425 votes.  Fuzzy math strikes again?  See Rebecca Mercuri, Corrupted
Polling, Inside Risks, *Communications of the ACM*, vol 36 no 11, Nov 1993,
p.122, on her Web site at 
  http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~mercuri/mynewhome/Papers/corrpoll.html

I would not trust a computerized voting system even if I had written it
myself, because of the many ways in which such systems can be subverted.
(Last night's events will undoubtedly slow down the final wrapup of
Rebecca's PhD thesis noted in RISKS-21.10, because there is more potential
grist for her mill -- not just in Florida, but in other states as well.)

Subject: E-voting as a panacea for Florida count?

http://www.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/11/08/e.voting.no.gamble.idg/index.html
An article on CNN.com quotes "experts" as saying that the problems getting
an accurate vote could have been avoided if everyone used electronic vote
counting technology.  [Note: not online voting... just electronic voting
machines.]

The article says in part "'Of course you would have 100 percent accuracy
with electronic voting. That would prevent the necessity of a recount,' said
Hans van Wijk, who markets electronic voting systems for Groenlo,
Netherlands-based Nedap.  In the Netherlands, some 80 percent of precincts
use e-voting, he said."

As has been discussed numerous times in RISKS (including yesterday in
RISKS-21.10), electronic counting is certainly not 100% accurate.  But if
this is what the public thinks of electronic counting, will there be the
same naive expectations about accuracy of online voting?  The article talks
about that too (quoting someone from Baltimore Technologies as saying
"Online voting would not only dramatically reduce the count time but also
ensure a more reliable initial result").  There is an acknowledgement that
online voting has its own dangers, noting the risks of accurate
identification of users, denial of service, and malicious attacks.  No
recognition though of the risks of just plain malfunctioning software,
though.

Gotta go.  All this gore-y discussion of a recount in Florida has me
bush-ed.

CNN's story about voting technology, on-line and otherwise:

An interesting quote from the article: "But Dublin-based electronic security
company Baltimore Technologies said reliability is no problem. "Online
voting would not only dramatically reduce the count time but also ensure a
more reliable initial result," said a spokeswoman. She added that online
voting would help older, ill, and disabled voters to take part in the
polls."  

RISKS readers will be happy to see there is also a discussion of potential
fraud and security risks.

"Hacking the Vote" (November 8, 2000)

"If they'd been listening to me all along, all of this election confusion
could have been avoided," said Paddy Mastoid.

Paddy is the president of trust-us-not-to-badly-screw-up-your-vote.com, a
firm promoting Internet voting systems.  I found 12 messages from him on my
voicemail this morning, as the nation awoke to the bizarre aftermath of
election day, with a historically close election still undecided and the
U.S. population swinging slowly in the wind.

"Look at this mess," said Paddy.  "Now they have to re-count all those votes
in Florida, there are concerns over voting irregularities down there, and we
might well end up with a President who didn't even win the popular vote!
Talk about not having a mandate.  And I could have prevented all of this
hassle!"

"How so?" I asked.

"Basically, our plan is to eliminate all those long lines at those obsolete
polling places.  We want to toss the antiquated paper ballots, punch cards,
and mechanical voting machines out the window.  We'll let people vote online
using the same home and office PCs that they already use for accessing
offshore gambling sites and downloading porn."

"Hmmm.  Sounds like a tempting goal, but aren't you worried about security,
reliability, all that sort of stuff?" I asked.

"Hey, we didn't just fall off the turnip truck.  We're using secure,
redundant Web servers, so your vote will be just as safe as your credit card
numbers during online purchases," said Paddy.  "You're happy buying things
online, aren't you?"
 
"Well, no, not really, not with all of the security breaches at sites that
were supposed to be secure, and their compromising of personal information.
I realize that things can go wrong with old-style voting systems, especially
if they're set up badly, but at least with them it's usually possible to do
various forms of meaningful re-counting when there's a question about an
election's validity."

"But that's my whole point!" said Paddy.  "Look at all the trouble being
caused by even being *able* to do a physical re-count.  Wouldn't it be better
to have a nice, computerized system where all the votes are electronic and
stored safely in computers where nobody but programmers, system
administrators, and top election officials can screw around with them?  You
don't think any of those guys would mess things up do you?  When it's all in
the computer, you don't have any *choice* but to trust the computer!  You
can't really re-count so there'd be no point to complaining.  Problem
solved!"

"Hmmm.  What about hackers?  If these systems are on the Internet, they'd
seem just as vulnerable to attack and manipulation as any other so-called
secure sites."

"Not to worry!" said Paddy.  "We ran a contest and invited hackers to crack
our demonstration system.  Five people tried and the only guy who got in was
a 12 year old kid in West Palm Beach, and he promised cross-his-heart not to
tell anyone how after we gave him a DVD player!  No problem there."

"But why would most hackers even want to tip their hands by playing with your
demo sites?  Wouldn't the real pros just wait until a real election and then
flood your servers with garbage to block real voters out?  Couldn't they
plant surprises in unrelated downloads that could hide on people's PCs for
months or years before being activated on election day to disrupt or
manipulate the voting process?  There's really no way to secure the typical
operating systems that most people have on their home or office computers
from those sorts of attacks," I said.

"Picky, picky, picky!" said Paddy.  "I say let's just deploy these Internet
voting systems now and keep the people happy.  If these hypothetical hackers
you're talking about are really that good, we probably wouldn't even realize
that they'd been screwing around with the election anyway.  Ignorance can be
bliss.  And that would sure be preferable to all the hassles they're having
in Florida today!"

"I really don't think that's necessarily true ..."

"And at least we wouldn't have network TV anchors getting punchy from being
up all night!" said Paddy.

"You do have a point about that," I said.

"I knew that I could convince you, Lauren."

Subject: Web sites report exit poll results before networks do

Whereas mainstream news organizations were bound by self-imposed rules
preventing them from releasing state exit poll results before the polls
closed, a number of politically oriented Web sites leaked the results as
soon as they were available. Voter News Service (VNS), the consortium of
news organizations that conducted the exit polls, is threatening to bring
legal action against the sites that leaked early results, including
DrudgeReport.com and Inside.com -- which, however, indicated that they
obtained the information not from VNS but from unidentified sources.
Inside.com editor Michael Hirschorn said that he had received e-mail leaks
from dozens of mainstream journalists, and that the public have as much
right to know that kind of information as journalists do. He added: "The
genie is out of the bottle, and it's wishful thinking that you could put it
back in. Once this information is out, thanks to e-mail and the Internet, it
becomes incredibly easy to distribute." [AP/*San Jose Mercury News*, 7 Nov

Subject: Vote auction Web site moves operations overseas

A Web site offering to sell 21,000 votes for President to the highest 
bidder has changed its domain name and transferred its registration to a 
company based in Germany. The www.vote-auction.com site asks visitors to 
fill out personal details and then offers to sell the votes in blocks 
broken down by state. The goal, according to the Web site, is to bring "the 
big money of campaigns directly to the voting public," but the owners, who 
are Austrian, say they still need to work out the details of how everyone 
would get paid, and how to verify that they cast the right ballot. The site 
has been criticized by election officials in Michigan, New York and other 
states, but as of its reopening this week, more than 2,500 California 
voters had offered their votes and the leading bid was $48,000, or $19.61 
per vote. In August, six people offering to sell their votes for President 
drew bids as high as $10,000 on eBay before the online auctioneer shut them 
down.  [AP 25 Oct 2000 http://news.excite.com/news/ap/001025/20/votes-for-sale

A week later, the FAA route center at Indianapolis is still running on

flight delays and at least two close encounters between airplanes".  The
cause of the original outage was still unknown.  The route center has 6
diesel generators, three of which are used normally and the other three are
for backup.  However, after the outage, the diesels fired up, but the main
radar could not be brought back up.  The 70 controllers had to had planes

The Verisign stuff is suppose to properly timestamp the signature, but
their clock is very wrong!! I did the signature at 12:42, and the .exe now
has a new modification timestamp of 12:42, but the certificate claims it
was signed at 12:46. So we cannot really believe the times in any of these
