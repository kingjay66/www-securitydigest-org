Subject: Playboy says hacker stole customer info

By Greg Sandoval and Robert Lemos, CNET News.com, 20 Nov 2001

Playboy.com has alerted customers that an intruder broke into its Web site
and obtained some customer information, including credit card numbers.  The
online unit of the nearly 50-year-old men's magazine said in an e-mail to
customers that it believed a hacker accessed "a portion" of Playboy.com's
computer systems. In the e-mail, a copy of which was reviewed by CNET
News.com, Playboy.com President Larry Lux did not disclose how many
customers might have been affected.

Playboy.com encouraged customers to contact their credit card 
companies to check for unauthorized charges. New York-based 
Playboy.com also said it reported the incident to law enforcement 
officials and hired a security expert to audit its computer systems 
and analyze the incident.  [...]

Subject: The cure is only slightly worse than the disease...

This story taken off of the newswire today:

http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20011121/od/tech_hongkong_champion_dc_1.html

Concerns a signal-jamming technology being developed by a Hong Kong company
to block cellphone calls in areas where they are not wanted. Not a bad idea,
but the following excerpt caught my attention:

  "A Hong Kong company hopes to sell signal-jamming technology previously
  used by the military to thwart lethal missiles to block annoying cellphone
  calls in places such as hospitals, places of worship and restaurants."

Hospitals? Now, I admit I know very little about jamming technology, but I
know that, at the very least, it requires transmitting radio energy on the
same frequency as the signal you are trying to jam. Presumably, it involves
transmitting at a considerably higher power than that of the target
signal. Now, as I understand it, hospitals' no-cellphone policy is based on
the fear that the phones' radio transmissions might interfere with hospital
equipment.  Are we to understand, then, that they intend to combat the
problem by installing a device that, by definition, must transmit on the
same frequencies at the same or considerably greater power?

I hope this was simply an error on the writer's part...

Subject: My daughter is failing high school!

OK, you ask, what does that have to do with RISKS?  Hold on a second!

Fairfax County Virginia has one school system (unlike other counties around
the US where each municipality or region has their own system).  My daughter
goes to a magnet high school program within the county, but not the one that
would ordinarily be our "home" school (i.e., the one closest to our house).

Last week she got her report card for the first quarter from the magnet
school.  Yesterday she got a second report card from the home school, which
doesn't show any courses or grades.  Luckily, it doesn't show a GPA either
(I guess the programmer was smart enough not to try to average zero credit
hours :-).  But it does show she attended school for 40 days and was absent
two days... the same number as in the magnet school.

So the county obviously has one database to record absences, but the
software isn't smart enough to realize she's not taking any courses at the
home school and therefore shouldn't get a report card.  Or maybe that's a
safeguard in case the child drops all classes without telling the parents?

I *hope* that when she goes to apply for college that they'll report her
actual GPA, and not something silly like 0.0 since the school system
obviously doesn't understand where she is!  The risks of poorly designed
database applications...

Subject: Network Solutions ad inadvertently names my domain

Back some months ago -- 11 Apr 2001, in fact -- a promotional mailer in the
form of a folded post card (11 inches by 15 inches) was mailed out to who
knows how many residences in Virginia (U.S.) by Network Solutions, a
VeriSign Company, advertising Web site services.

Amusingly, the advertisement listed www.squirreling.org as a sample domain
name, describing a "matching e-mail address like this" with
yourname@squirreling.com as their "matching e-mail address."

Aside from the fact that Network Solutions mixed .ORG with .COM, apparently
they didn't bother to check first to see whether Squirreling.ORG was an
existing web site before they advertised it as an example.  In fact I had
registered the domain name on February 2'nd, 2000 and had acquired hosting
shortly after that.  The name "Squirreling" was doubtlessly picked because
it sounds amusing and Network Solutions probably assumed that nobody would
have such a domain.

The risks?  What if my web site had been something sinister?  Network
Solutions could have suffered massive embarrassment and revenue losses had
my web site contained "Bonsai Kittens" or something equally stupid on it.

Subject: Another date risk (Re: Brown, RISKS-21.76)

Lotus and most other spreadsheets have another date risk, caused by trying
to maintain compatibility with Visicalc in the original Lotus and carried
over from there.

Dates are stored as the number of days since the start of 1900. That is Jan
1, 1900 is stored as 1, etc. The problem is the original programmers thought
that 1900 was a leap year.

Enter 60 into a date-formatted cell. Many spreadsheets will display it as
Feb 29, 1900!

Microsoft Multiplan handles this by making Jan 1, 1900 store as 2 rather
than 1. But that means dates in it won't match dates in other spreadsheets
if they are before March 1, 1900.

There's no good solution anymore due to the spread of this "misfeature" thru
spreadsheets across the world. All you can do is double check *any* date
info from before 1900-03-01 that has passed thru (or may have passed thru) a
spreadsheet.

Subject: Re: Researchers probe Net's 'dark address space'

We have fallen into the accidental misconfiguration trap a few times for
some of these cases -- the primary reason it happened to us is that routes
advertised using "classless" IP address ranges do not get treated properly
by a router that doesn't have 'ip classless' set (in Cisco-speak). This is
the Classless-InterDomain Routing (CIDR) system that replaced the old
Class-A, class-B, class-C hierarchy. The cable modem and military people
tend to populate parts of old class-A blocks - this is any IP address that
starts with a number less than 128. In our case what happened was we had a
"specialty" internet provider that only provided access to certain networks
which they advertised to us via the BGP protocol, and they filtered out any
traffic coming from us that didn't match that list of networks. But it
turned out that some of the networks they advertised were small portions of
these old class-A networks, and we naively did not have "classless" routing
turned on, so our router thought the ENTIRE class-A had to be routed through
them. So traffic between us and any address in that class-A block not passed
through by our provider was blocked.

One reason we didn't have classless routing turned on was some previous bad
experience where one of our partners' router's memory had been filled with
spurious /32 routes (routes with only a single address) due to the use of
classless routing, the fact that we did not have all possible routes to our
own address space properly advertised to one another, and the malicious
actions of some printer software that tried to scan every single address in
our (class-B) address space, looking for printers.

In short, it's very easy, if you do not have much background in IP
networking, to misconfigure your routers to have this sort of thing happen -
and it's a little hard to spot since the network connections are generally
working fine otherwise - nobody may ever complain!

According to a well-placed friend within Apple, the failure was a bit more
complex than described.  He says that the bug in the script was actually
discovered prior to the software being posted, but that the corrected
version somehow did not end up being posted (classic version management
issue.)  Furthermore, the fact that broken script had been posted was
discovered in the middle of the night, but the folks responsible for the
server did not pull it down until hours later, thus increasing the
collateral damage (classic people management issue.)

And of course no self-respecting non-US anti-virus firm is going to put a

Somehow the first time it is detected by anyone it will get into F-Prot,
F-Secure, AVP and a number of other non-US products that are widely used
even in the US, and then what?  If the AV product vendors ignore this
software, they are in for attack from their customers, and if they detect it
they are in for attack from the FBI?

Which would you choose were it your corporation?  This type of program and
its detection is too much of a risk for the FBI for them to widely
disseminate it, and ignoring such a program is too much of a risk for the AV
product vendors to accept, since alienating their clients will unfortunately
result in a major downturn in their corporate viability, once it becomes
known, which will be almost immediately.

First off, nothing about this program indicates that it is a virus.  There
is nothing about reproduction in the description.  In any case, a virus
would be a fairly imprecise way of delivering a security breaking package
(although steps could be taken in that regard).

As the later material shows, the program is not capable of reading encrypted
data, it simply steals passwords.  Fairly common activity for trojans in
past years.

As Peter notes, Microsoft Outlook is somewhat susceptible to this type of
thing, but in pretty much every other case you'd have to convince the target
to run an attachment.  That might be a little trickier.  "The attached
Microsoft Word document contains an application form for our special Kali
cartel `frequent pusher' discount, good for an extra 10% off on shipments of
100 kilos or more."  "Run this hilarious screensaver with inspirational
(secret) messages from our beloved leader Osama, along with detailed
instructions on the construction of truck bombs."
  [But this seemed to happen all the time with IL*V*Y**, etc.  PGN]

The targeting of PGP is interesting.  Does this mean that the US government
is still ticked over its creation, or that they are finally (tacitly)
admitting that open-source software really *is* more secure?

It would certainly be easier to collect information, particularly for
ephemeral data, such as e-mail.  On the other hand, how are the authorities
supposed to get at the data?  I suppose sending out only the passphrase
would be less suspicious if someone was keeping track of traffic.  (On the
other hand, if anyone was logging port activity it would be fairly easy to
scan for Magic Lantern in the same way that people scan for Back Orifice,
SubSeven, Bionet, and other RATs.)

Penetrating how?  I would hope that the RISKS audience is somewhat less
suggestible, along these lines, than the general public.  [You must be
kidding!  PGN]

>  Penetrability of supposedly secure systems has long been noted here ...

True, but the penetration is still probably going to happen on a case by
case basis.  Viruses would be a good way to break confidentiality (just look
at Sircam), but are rather a blunt instrument, tending to drown signal with
noise (look at Noped).

> The best folks prefer product engineering (aka 'development'). 

I don't believe this is true at all.

I believe that the vast majority of employees, and many managers, in the
computer field regard product engineering as the "senior" department, the
superior order amongst technical professionals.  [That upper management
often considers sales to outrank all technical groups takes a while to
discover....]  The result is that other technical departments, such as QA
and IT, are often staffed largely with junior engineers biding their time
and acquiring years of experience to try to get into product engineering.
Naturally, they're not very good at what they're currently being paid to do
-- they'd much prefer to be in product engineering -- but they're not
necessarily any better at *it*.  On the counter side, there *are* a few
excellent, committed QA and IT and Tech Support folks around -- "the best"
in these realms -- and often that is intimately tied to their discovery of a
personal preference for one of these "ancillary" roles.

I would say that the *majority* prefer product engineering -- and that this
is linked, chicken-and-egg fashion, to other branches being
under-appreciated and staffed largely by inexperienced, uninterested, and
(as a consequence) ineffective personnel.  The consequences?  We read about
them on the RISKS Digest every week.

According to the Dec 2001 issue of *Consumer Reports*, your problems with
toasters are not unique, and they were able to get better toast from some
simpler toasters (that is, without all the sensors).

However, the risk of toasters not turning off until they have popped has
been addressed in the US. There is now a Consumer Product Safety Commission
standard requiring toasters to turn off when the cycle is over, whether or
not the "pop" has occurred. It takes effect for toasters manufactured after
November 2001, but many toasters are now compliant (and some actually give
some indication of this compliance on the box).

In RISKS-21.76, we read about (800)555-1212 re-directing information
calls. Those familiar with the history of the telephone system may recall
that Almon P. Strowger, generally regarded as the inventor of automatic
telephone switching apparatus (at least in the U.S.A. :-) was an undertaker,
who produced his invention because he was tired of the telephone operator in
his town "accidentally connecting" his calls to his competitor, said
operator's husband. Of course, all those helpful Web "directory" sites have
been doing this for years, and "Smart-Links" threatens to move the betrayal
right to your PC. (Yes, I know, not _right_ now, yet...)

Brett Glass's story on operator-assisted dialing that resulted in customer

apparatus in place for many decades. (As the story is told, Strowger
[STRO-jer] suspected the local telephone exchanges of routing potential
customers [well, I suspose the families of potential customers!] for his
funeral parlor to his competitors' parlors. Paranoia was the mother of
Strowger's invention.)

As long as callers leave the recipient-to-number translation in the hands of
others, for convenience of any other reason, this problem will likely persist.

While this is certainly an issue; IMHO Bret has the risk all wrong. This
is a classic case of 'Never attribute to malice what can be explained by

I'm not going to comment on national ID cards directly, but only upon Adam
Shostack's reasoning.  Every web page (instruction, datum, etc.)  is
accessed a first time, as well, but caches still work pretty darn well on a
statistical basis.

Screening will always be a statistics game, but we need to attach wildly
different costs to various kinds of screening misses.  Clearly, 20 box
cutters can ruin a lot of days.  The IBM 360/30 didn't execute a "divide"
instruction or a "convert to decimal" instruction very often, but when it
did, they was so slow that they often dominated instruction trace timings.
So the next generation of 360's improved the execution speed of those
particular instructions.

However, much of the improvement in computer execution speeds over the past
twenty years is the result of tuning to more broadly valid statistical data,
rather than focusing only on rare but costly instructions.  Similarly, we
need to continue to make _flying as a whole_ safer, rather than focus only
on the threat of terrorism, as the recent NYC crash sadly proves.

This is probably a result of aggressive product management.

Some years ago I worked for Mitsubishi Consumer Electronics in their
software department, and was tasked to write the code to implement
parental lock on a (now long defunct) chassis of TV set.  

I'd implemented it so that all the settings would remain as parents locked
and unlocked the TV, so that parents could set all their settings for each
channel once and allow or deny TV viewing according to those settings as
they liked.

Much of that logic had to be re-implemented for a different behavior:
unlocking the TV caused ALL of the information about which channels or times
were or were not permissible to be erased, requiring that they be re-entered
next time.

The reason for this was that apparently support telephone calls on the issue
of parental lock nearly never asked the question "Why can't I lock my kids
out of the television?" and instead nearly always asked "My kids have locked
me out of the television.  What do I do?"  Since those calls cost money to
support a product for which the company had already been paid, they were to
be minimized.  The product had to be easy to unlock and hard to lock.

I suspect this behavior in Windows XP is a similar matter.

Subject: Let's get really paranoid about e-mail and spam...

Re: Porn spam being sent in my name (Sanders, RISKS-21.76)
 
Here's how much worse it can get: In the past couple of years, I've opened
up e-mail accounts on three different systems: Yahoo Mail, HotMail, and
MyRealBox.com.

These accounts were used ONLY for testing internet e-mail gateways on new
e-mail systems that we set up for clients They have never been used for
posting to a list, responding to an ad, and/or have never been entered into
any Web site.

 - Within two months of opening the Yahoo! Mail account, it started
   receiving spam, none of it from Yahoo.

 - Within three days of opening the HotMail account, it started receiving
   spam, in amounts far larger than the Yahoo account.

In both of the above cases, I had specifically selected to NOT be listed in
either of the systems' directories, and to NOT receive e-mail offers from any
of their "marketing partners".  Neither of these accounts were ever used to
respond to offers, entered into Web sites, or published anywhere.  They were
only used to send and receive test e-mail messages to and from new e-mail
servers.

Either Yahoo Mail and HotMail are lying about not publishing or selling
addresses, or someone's harvesting e-mail addresses by sniffing packets.
(Hence the subject of this message.)  As much as I'd like to bash the
vendors ... I strongly suspect the answer is that someone's found a way to
harvest e-mail addresses.  (Keep reading.)

I next opened up a third test account, on MyRealBox.com.  This is a
demonstration mail service operated by Novell, Inc., to show off its NIMS
product, and having met people from the NIMS team at various Novell
functions, I had been informed that they specifically do NOT sell the
MyRealBox accounts, nor use them for marketing purposes of any kind.

For about six months, I received no spam of any kind on the MyRealBox
account.  Suddenly, I was flooded with everything from "failed delivery"
messages to angry missives threatening me with bodily harm for spamming
them.

Some of the missives included the complete message, which was a piece of
spam generated with my MyRealBox account name in the "From" and "Reply-To"
fields!  The messages did NOT originate from MyRealBox, however, nor did
they pass through any "traceable" intermediate mail servers (only IP
addresses were shown in the headers).

This raises the question: if the MyRealBox account name wasn't sold (and I
believe it wasn't), then how on earth did the spammers "harvest" my specific
MyRealBox account name to use to send spam with?  (And are there any steps
one can take to prevent it from happening again?)

This also brings to mind the risk of using a "free" internet e-mail account,
or any type of outsourced e-mail server over which one has no legal or
authoritative control.
