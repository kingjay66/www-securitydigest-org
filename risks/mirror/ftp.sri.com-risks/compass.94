COMPASS is an annual conference committed to bringing together
researchers, developers, and evaluators who work on problems
related to specifying, building, and certifying high-assurance
computer systems.  What distinguishes COMPASS from similar
conferences is its emphasis on bridging the gap between research
and practice.  Researchers are provided an opportunity to present
results, new theories, and new technologies to both other
researchers and practitioners who can put them to practice.  They
can also learn from practitioners of new research problem domains
and of problems encountered in building real systems. 
Practitioners have an opportunity to share lessons learned, to
learn of new research, and to influence future research.

Welcome to COMPASS 94, the ninth in a series of annual symposia on
Computer Assurance. This year's conference focuses on both the use
and assessment of formal methods and on alternatives to formal
verification in a variety of critical areas:

                       * Safety
                       * Reliability
                       * Fault Tolerance
                       * Concurrency and Real Time
                       * Security

At COMPASS, the diverse program and small conference atmosphere
provide plenty of opportunity for audience and speakers to mingle
and share their experiences.  The audience bring their own wealth
of knowledge, and interchanges among industry, members of
government agencies, and academia provide unique opportunities to
discuss current requirements and future needs.  We invite you to
participate and increase the benefits of COMPASS by your
attendance.Conference          General Co-Chairs:  Jarrellann Filsinger,

                    1.  "Formal Software Development Using Z"
                        John McDermid, University of York

                    Much has been written about the benefit of
                    formal methods for developing high integrity
                    software -- but there are relatively few
                    examples of successful use of formal methods
                    on large scale projects.  This tutorial
                    demonstrates that cost-effective formal
                    software development is now possible, using Z
                    and a refinement approach into Ada that is
                    supported by two tools: CADiZ and ZETA. 
                    CADiZ supports the production and analysis of
                    Z specifications.  ZETA supports formal,
                    rigorous or informal stepwise development of
                    Ada from Z specifications (in compliance with
                    the UK Interim Defence Standard 00-55) in a
                    cost-effective way that enables the user to
                    determine the level of rigor for the
                    refinement. Examples will be offered, and the
                    tools will be demonstrated in support of the
                    presentation.

                    2.  "Software System Evaluation and
                         Certification" 
                         Hans-Ludwig Hausen, GMD (German National
                         Research Center for Computer Science)
                         [FULL DAY]

                    Software quality evaluation and certification
                    have been recognized as important issues for
                    the American, European and especially the
                    Japanese software industry.  This tutorial
                    focuses on the methods and tools for the
                    evaluation and assessment of software
                    products and processes. Particular emphasis
                    is given to identifying and selecting
                    software characteristics and metrics and the
                    handling of evaluation methods and tools. 
                    The impact of the SEI Capability Maturity
                    Model, SPICE, ISO 9000 series, ISO 12119, ISO
                    9126 and the EVALUATION METHOD will be
                    discussed in detail.

                    The goals and techniques of software hazard
                    analysis will be presented and general
                    procedures, including new state machine
                    algorithms, discussed.  Topics include
                    Software System Hazard Analysis and Software
                    Requirements Analysis.  Finally, an example
                    using a real application (TCAS II) will be offered.

                         [HALF DAY]

                    In this half-day tutorial, the participants
                    will play the roles of entrepreneurs who are
                    developing a new medical device.  The goal is
                    for participants to develop the preliminary concept
                    for the device, including safety requirements. 
                    If time permits, participants will develop a plan
                    for validation and verification of the device, 
                    addressing regulatory Good Manufacturing Practice
                    issues in the process.
