Subject: Bruce Schneier on Airport Photo ID Checks

Opinion

The TSA's useless photo ID rules
No-fly lists and photo IDs are supposed to help protect the flying
public from terrorists. Except that they don't work.

By Bruce Schneier

August 28, 2008
http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-schneier28-2008aug28,0,3099808.story

The TSA is tightening its photo ID rules at airport security.  Previously,
people with expired IDs or who claimed to have lost their IDs were subjected
to secondary screening. Then the Transportation Security Administration
realized that meant someone on the government's no-fly list -- the list that
is supposed to keep our planes safe from terrorists -- could just fly with
no ID.

Now, people without ID must also answer personal questions from their credit
history to ascertain their identity. The TSA will keep records of who those
ID-less people are, too, in case they're trying to probe the system.

This may seem like an improvement, except that the photo ID requirement is a
joke. Anyone on the no-fly list can easily fly whenever he wants. Even
worse, the whole concept of matching passenger names against a list of bad
guys has negligible security value.

How to fly, even if you are on the no-fly list: Buy a ticket in some
innocent person's name. At home, before your flight, check in online and
print out your boarding pass. Then, save that web page as a PDF and use
Adobe Acrobat to change the name on the boarding pass to your own. Print it
again. At the airport, use the fake boarding pass and your valid ID to get
through security. At the gate, use the real boarding pass in the fake name
to board your flight.

The problem is that it is unverified passenger names that get checked
against the no-fly list. At security checkpoints, the TSA just matches IDs
to whatever is printed on the boarding passes. The airline checks boarding
passes against tickets when people board the plane. But because no one
checks ticketed names against IDs, the security breaks down.

This vulnerability isn't new. It isn't even subtle. I first wrote about it
in 2006. I asked Kip Hawley, who runs the TSA, about it in 2007. Today, any
terrorist smart enough to Google "print your own boarding pass" can bypass
the no-fly list.

This gaping security hole would bother me more if the very idea of a no-fly
list weren't so ineffective. The system is based on the faulty notion that
the feds have this master list of terrorists, and all we have to do is keep
the people on the list off the planes.

That's just not true. The no-fly list -- a list of people so dangerous they
are not allowed to fly yet so innocent we can't arrest them -- and the less
dangerous "watch list" contain a combined 1 million names representing the
identities and aliases of an estimated 400,000 people. There aren't that
many terrorists out there; if there were, we would be feeling their effects.

Almost all of the people stopped by the no-fly list are false positives. It
catches innocents such as Ted Kennedy, whose name is similar to someone's on
the list, and Islam Yusuf (formerly Cat Stevens), who was on the list but no
one knew why.

The no-fly list is a Kafkaesque nightmare for the thousands of innocent
Americans who are harassed and detained every time they fly.  Put on the
list by unidentified government officials, they can't get off. They can't
challenge the TSA about their status or prove their innocence. (The U.S. 9th
Circuit Court of Appeals decided this month that no-fly passengers can sue
the FBI, but that strategy hasn't been tried yet.)

But even if these lists were complete and accurate, they wouldn't
work. Timothy McVeigh, the Unabomber, the D.C. snipers, the London subway
bombers and most of the 9/11 terrorists weren't on any list before they
committed their terrorist acts. And if a terrorist wants to know if he's on
a list, the TSA has approved a convenient, $100 service that allows him to
figure it out: the Clear program, which issues IDs to "trusted travelers" to
speed them through security lines. Just apply for a Clear card; if you get
one, you're not on the list.

In the end, the photo ID requirement is based on the myth that we can
somehow correlate identity with intent. We can't. And instead of wasting
money trying, we would be far safer as a nation if we invested in
intelligence, investigation and emergency response -- security measures that
aren't based on a guess about a terrorist target or tactic.

That's the TSA: Not doing the right things. Not even doing right the things
it does.

On 26 Aug 2008, the Atlanta Federal Aviation Administration facility had
difficulties processing data, which meant that all of its flight-plan
information had to be processed by the Salt Lake City facility -- which
became overloaded.  As a result, airports experienced hours of flight delays
on Tuesday afternoon and into the evening.  A similar event occurred on 8
Jun 2007.  [Source: CNN.com item, 26 Aug 2008; PGN-ed]

Subject: Aug 26 flight plan fiasco

Apropos of the Aug 26 flight plan disaster, FAA spokeswoman Diane Spitaliere
said that the investigation into what caused the problem is still ongoing,
and she did not know when it would be completed. "It usually takes a while
to be quite honest," she said. (AP, 8/26/08)

Is this improper to imagine: "Traffic control to all planes in flight: We're
having problems with traffic logistics and don't know when they will be
unsnarled, to be quite honest. Please proceed to and augment the nearest
holding pattern, remain aloft, and observe VFR until further notice."

  [Unfortunate recording of what she said?  "It usually takes a while to be
  quite honest."  It should NEVER take any time to be honest.  We presume
  that what she said orally should have been transcribed as "It usually
  takes a while, to be quite honest."  But commas are seldom COMMAndeered

Subject: States throw out costly electronic voting machines

The demise of touch-screen voting has produced a graveyard of expensive
corpses: Warehouses stacked with thousands of carefully wrapped voting
machines that have been shelved because of doubts about vanishing votes and
vulnerability to hackers.

What to do with this high-tech junkyard is a multimillion-dollar
question. One manufacturer offered $1 a piece to take back its ATM-like
machines. Some states are offering the devices for sale on eBay and
craigslist. Others hope to sell their inventories to Third-World countries
or salvage them for scrap.

Much money could have been saved had those bureaucrats just been subscribers

Subject: And here we go off the rails: "spam hunter"

A large amount of spams were sent out in the name of a well known "spam
hunter" in Switzerland, alleging he was about to commit suicide (Article in
German at <http://www.20min.ch/digital/webpage/story/19754588>).

The attack (according to the media and interview with the person involved)
appears to bear signs of the "Russian Internet mafia", and appears to herald
a change into personal territory by the criminals involved.  This attack has
already had effect in that the subject is reconsidering what he does for a
living.  It's not a new idea to go personal, especially Spamhouse has
suffered its share over the years.

The ensuing discussion on a security mailing list was interesting.  It
started with a simple observation that it maybe was a drive-by attack with
infected websites, but there are some deeper implications.  I've compiled
the observations below.

  - - - first response - - -

>  AFAIK no DriveBy download, as the domains are not responding at all.

That may have more to do with actions of ISPs in the chain or there may be
irony at work - the serving DNS may have been poisoned, thus having one
evil canceling out another.

Calling it that way ignores the real issue IMHO..

> Apparently several people contacted the police to report a possible

What happened here was that the spammers got personal, and with a large
degree of success as the guy is now reconsidering what he's going to do
professionally.

Let me translate this for you:

1 - he was obviously successful in what he did or whoever did this would not
have bothered;

2 - a couple of published successes like that will ensure this to become a
frequent event.  The good news is that the effect will diminish over time,
the bad news is that this will take time.  Are you prepared to have family
and friends threatened in this way - YOU may know it's mostly air, but most
non-professionals don't., and it won't stop here.

  - - - next response - - -

yep. try to explain THAT to your friends, customers, business contacts,
etc. IF they are on the recipient list for that kind of spam. It could
take you out of business, if people read that kind of crap and probably
believe it. Even worse: Who are you going to inform about the faked story?
If you inform all of your contacts, you will alert also those who did
not even know about the SPAM problem.

Foucaut's wireless bill from T-Mobile arrived a few weeks ago. It included

Montreal -- the equivalent of downloading about 80 novels.

At the moment, we experience tropical storm Fay here in the Miami area.  It
does not seem too bad compared to past tropical storms, and we have only
experienced some few power outages that got fixed fairly quickly
(typical). We've had some pretty impressive wind gusts (I'd guess about
40-50MPH). However, I noticed something really weird.

I have a battery operated clock that syncs via radio signal reception with
the atomic clock in Boulder (very common - made by Oregon Scientific). It
currently shows the correct time (as of writing: 9:05 PM EDT) but shows the
date as Saturday September 27th 2008 instead of the correct date of Monday
August 18, 2008!

I have no idea why this has happened. Perhaps some weird electromagnetic
effect due to the storm (I have noticed things like compasses giving 180
degree wrong readings and spinning during storms)? Perhaps just some other
glitch that just coincidentally happened during the storm?

Subject: Risks of omitting off-site backups?

Victor M. Deeb is wondering why 20 years of his work was thrown away.  At
71, he had been experimenting in his basement laboratory.  When firemen came
in to put out a fire in a window air conditioner, they found 1500 vials,
jars cans, bottles, and boxes of chemicals in his basement when they went to
turn off the power.  The Massachusetts state hazardous materials team
reacted by having everything that was deemed hazardous removed and disposed
of.  So, 45 years of his research in polymer chemistry went down the drain
(so to speak).  However, all of his materials were approved by the U.S. FDA
and seemingly nonhazardous.  City officials maintain he was violating zoning
laws.  They also maintain he was given opportunities to recover his 20-years
worth of notes, which were apparently seized.  [Source: Priyanka Dayal,

Subject: Telephone banking password /in/security

See this story in the BBC news: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hereford/worcs/7585098.stm

The story raises at least two questions.

Firstly, if we are to believe the story, the person found out what his
password had been altered to.  So the whole text of the password was
available to him (and probably to members of bank staff also). This should
not be the case for obvious reasons.

Secondly, the story itself is extraordinary, as the BBC seem to have no
notion that there might be a serious problem here, rather than just an
amusing story.

It's tempting to add that this must mean that telephone banking passwords
are held in plain-text equivalent, and that this is obviously a huge
security problem.  It does mean that they must be in plain-text equivalent,
but things are not quite so simple: given the common "tell me characters a,
b, and c of your password" approach, a conventional one-way hash of the
password does not work.  I suppose you could create hashes for every
possible subset of (say) 3 characters (so for "password", hash "pas-----",
"pa-s----" & so on), but that may be quite a lot of hashes (I think it is
the number of combinations, so for 3-from-10 it would be 120 hashes, for
3-from-20 it would be 1140), and might also give an attacker a way into
guessing the whole password.  Still, that would probably be a lot better
than keeping it in clear, which seems to be what is happening here.

Several readers have reported being charged $49.95 for a permit application,
which is a pain as the previous paper I-94W forms were free.  As far as I
can tell, applying via the official ESTA web site is free, but it appears
that doing a Google (or similar) search for the site will match on some

agencies may be offering some sort of value-added service, but the RISK is
that people may be persuaded to pay a third party unnecessarily for
