Subject: Optic fibre fragment kills Telecom worker

Not too long ago a Telecom worker in Western Australia was reportedly killed
when a fragment of fibre optic glass accidentally got into his blood stream.
Remembering this, I was horrified to see at a recent trade show some very
casual handling of raw fibre by visitors and sales reps at a stand.  Some
children were trying to handle the fibre bundle too (I stopped them) The risk
is apparent, in the frenetic effort to "de-mytholise" [demythologize?]
technology for the general public, we (industry professionals) unknowingly
jeopardise their safety.

Can anyone confirm the Telecom worker report?  (RISKS-15.17, `Fiber Optic
Cable "Meltdown" in Connecticut' prompted this response, as it is not strictly
computing.)

Subject: Lanocaine (sp?)

There was a story on the radio (which is why I can't spell it) about patients
dying from incorrect dosages of Lanocaine (sp?) because the syringes for the
different dosages look too much alike. It brings to mind the discussion on
incorrectly calculated radiation dosages. While one can argue that the
computer-based systems are very complex and need to meet high standards, I
wonder how the problems of such systems compare with those of more
conventional systems. The estimates I've heard about incorrect dosages during
normal hospital procedures is very high. (Yes, I'm being vague but I don't
have the actual numbers readily available).

Subject: Ethernet addresses as "port" IDs

  In RISKS 15.18, padgett@tccslr.dnet.mmc.com (A. Padgett Peterson) discusses
a scheme for using the ethernet MAC address as a mechanism for verifying
location, much like we used to do with hardwired mainframe ports.

  Unfortunately, there are two problems here.  The first is probably the
most damaging - the ethernet address is the address of the transmitting unit
ON THAT ETHERNET segment.  If the unit is not on that segment and is sending
via a router, for example, then the ethernet address will be that of the 
router's ethernet transmitter, and not the originator's physical address.

  As to re-writing the ethernet address in the unit itself, I believe that
cicso routers can do that rather easily.  I don't have the manuals here at home
but I seem to remember that is a functionality that is needed in the DEC world.

Subject: File on Four on safety-critical software

The BBC Radio 4 programme "File on Four" last Tuesday was devoted to the 
subject of safety-critical software. 

It discussed the causes of the "software crisis", described a number of the 
famous recent disasters, and then considered what can be done about it. 

The problems that arise with software are due to "complexity", "novelty", 
and "discontinuity". 

Prof. Cliff Jones of Manchester characterised the complexity of software in 
terms of the number of branch points it may contain, and hence the number of 
possible paths through it. The combinatorial explosion of possible paths 
makes exhaustive testing impossible in all but the simplest programs. It may 
be difficult to achieve with 50 Lines of code and 10 branch points. With 
10,000 LOC and the same density of branch points, the testing time would 
exceed the time elapsed since the big bang. As he pointed out, the Sizewell B 
Primary Protection System contains 100,000 LOC. 

Prof. Bev Littlewood of CSR criticised the tendency of manufacturers to take 
advantage of the presence of software to make systems perform more and more 
new functions, so that the soft-centred systems are many times more complex 
than those they replace, and are also attempting completely novel things, 
whose consequences may be poorly understood. 

Cliff Jones returned to describe the discontinuous nature of digital systems, 
whereby changing one bit in the internal state or input may cause a vast 
change in the output. This is in contrast with the "traditional" engineering 
approach which relies on the fact that, in systems which are governed by 
the laws of physics instead of the rules of logic, a continuous variation 
of input leads to a continuous variation of output. 

I spoke briefly about the problems of certifying software to a certain 
numerical level of reliability, with particular reference to avionics systems, 
where the regulations specifically exclude software from reliability 
measurement, with the result that manufacturers treat its reliability as 1 
for the purposes of calculating overall system reliability. 

Martyn Thomas described the guidelines for avionics software as simply 
exhorting the manufacturer to "try harder" with the more critical stuff. 
Dan Hawkes of the CAA pointed out that "do your best" is an approach often 
used with certain hardware systems on aircraft, and said that software was 
treated no differently from some hardware. 

Martyn was in favour of using formal methods on safety-critical software, and
also of qualifying the people who work on it. There are no formal
qualifications required before a practitioner may tackle a safety-critical
item of software, and yet, as Cliff Jones pointed out, programming
productivity has been found to vary by up to a factor of 10 between
individuals. "Error-prone" modules are regularly found in industry, and this,
Cliff speculated, could be due to their being written by error-prone
individuals.

Various disasters were cited, including the recent Gripen crash in Stockholm, 
and the London Ambulance fiasco. Both have been well covered on the list. 
A couple of anecdotes of interest concerned the man who called an ambulance 
for his mother, who had suffered a stroke. After several hours, he took her 
to hospital in his own car. The ambulance turned up 10 hours later. The crew 
of another ambulance radioed base after being sent out on a call and asked why 
the undertaker had managed to get there before them! 

My favourite item concerned the garage owner who specialises in tuning 
software. He gets the binary from the engine management ROM by mounting it 
in some harness on his PC. With experience, he is able to spot the data 
tables containing the engine parameters, and he alters the values. By trial 
and error, he has found how to undo the "detuning" that is often designed 
into these systems, and he makes the car give you "... a bigger kick in the 
back, when you give it some boot!" (or words to that effect!). 

Regarding Sizewell B PPS, which was discussed at some length, a "confidential 
leaked document" had found its way into the producers' hands, and was 
quoted at length. Presumably, this was the same as the one that was featured 
on BBC Channel 4 TV news not long ago, and is now being sold for two pounds 
by Computer Weekly? I'll let you know when I receive my copy! :-)

Subject: Cracking feature in the small press

This week's (October 21) "Coast Weekly", a Monterey County free entertainment
(mostly) paper has an article on "hacking" by staff writer Nicole Volpe.
I'll quote part of an introduction from the editorial page.
    "While interviewing computer hackers for this issue, it occurred
    to me that there are a lot of similarities between reporters and
    cyberpunks - We share a belief in freedom of information, a general
    suspicion of those in power who operate secretly, and an unfortunate
    tendency to invade privacy.

    This reporter got a taste of what it's like to be on the receiving end
    of privacy invasion when a hacker I was interviewing handed me a
    printout of personal information about me that he had retrieved,
    using nothing more than my home phone number.  His reasons were valid
    enough - he wanted to be sure I was who I said I was.  As a reporter
    I was impressed with the investigation, but on a personal level, it gave
    me the creeps.  It was a lesson they don't teach you in J-school..."

The main article covers the exploits of some crackers in the Monterey area,
their concern about the Clipper proposal, some stuff about arrests of
crackers in other parts of the country, and an interview with a security
man from Metromedia's long distance business.  The latter says, "If you
picked up the phone a year ago, dialed one digit, and then hung up, I
could go back and find out what that one digit was.  All the records are
stored on magnetic tape."     [Balance of message was apparently truncated.]

Watt counts as a high-power emitter? I'd be ohm-bliged for amp-lification.
The radios (including transponder) in my humble Archer take roughly 7 amps at
something approximating 14 volts when transmitting.

Subject: Re: Clipper

I refer all of the risks readers to a set of articles in the LA Times of
10/3/93 which discusses risks related to the Clipper chip.  And to fuel the
debate, I add my own comments:

	IF we hinge everything on the clipper chip and an enemy breaks it,
we are vulnerable at every level.  Isn't diversity a good idea for protecting
the US combined information assets?

	I will be willing to use the clipper chip for all of my encryption IF
the NSA, DoD, and ALL US Government applications use the clipper chip for ALL
of their encryption as well.  Do they really trust it that much?  I doubt it.

	The NY Times article says the US is considering giving clipper chip
keys to other governments so they can monitor our communications as well!
Does this mean France will be able to steal our trade secrets?  They have
already started doing it on airplanes, but now they will be able to do it
en-masse at low cost - sponsored by the US Government.

	Now that we all know the clipper chip is manufactured by Micronix in
Torrence, CA, how long will it be before spies manage to get the design and
the `secret' keys?  Do we really believe that security there is good enough
to trust our entire national assets to it?

	Is the US Government giving a monopoly to Micronix for all cryptography
in the US?  Since when do they have that right?

	Won't the criminals the government claims to be trying to catch be able
to buy encryption from the rest of the world?  Even if it's illegal to do so,
they are criminals, so they will probably be willing!  That means that only
the criminals will be able to avoid surveillance designed to only observe
criminals.

	If there are only a thousand or so legitimate phone taps per year in
the US, is it really worthwhile to spend $26 per chip times a few hundred
million chips (over 2 billion dollars) nationwide just to assure 1,000 phone
taps?  That's 2 million dollars per (phone tap per year)!  I would think that
for 2 million dollars per criminal, the US Government could come up with a
much more effective plan for getting the information they need.

	Suppose the NSA is wrong?  They've been wrong before!  Suppose Clipper
becomes not so hard to break because of some mathematical breakthrough?  Are
they willing to bet the farm on this?

Well, that should get things going - FC

United Press Intl newswire via CompuServe Executive News Service:

  Computer chip manufacturer seeks way to stem theft
     SANTA CLARA, Calif. (UPI) -- One of the nation's largest manufacturers
  of computer chips said Friday it will start to put serial numbers on its
  products in an effort to stem the rising tide of robberies."

This move should make it harder for thieves to sell their loot; one hopes it
will therefore make warehouses less attractive targets for the armed gangs who
have terrorized Silicon Valley in recent months.

And the problem with stealing chips is that you can't take just one....

Subject: Re: Dangers of Anonymous Mailers

In Risks 15.17, an32153@anon.penet.fi remarked upon the dangers of including a
signature with anonymous postings.  It's not quite as absurd as it seems, if
someone uses a mailer that appends the signature automatically ( I can't
imagine that anyone who cared about their anonymity, as opposed to those who
just are assigned an anonymous id because they reply to somebody who uses one,
would deliberately append a revealing signature ).  The solution to that, at
least on anon.penet.fi, is simple: The server considers anything after a line
beginning with two dashes as a signature and cuts it off ( this can be a
complication if someone tries to append a document to a message and uses a row
of dashes to separate it from the main text ).  So if you want to send mail
anonymously, either dump your signature or be certain it starts with --.

Subject:  Re:Swiss AntiViral legislation

Colleagues and friends, thanks for the very helpful and positively critical
comments. I append Mr. Frigerio's reply for your information. Klaus
(Oct.21,1993)

PS: Mr. Frigerio will have another fight with lawyers who think that any
legislation is dangerous as it may also hurt the "good viruses". I argued that
"good viruses" exist only in Dr. Cohen's head, as those applications which he
always mentions can be realized by non-replicative methods. Moreover, any auto
matic reproduction has an unwished side-effect, as copyrights for any software
does only apply to the original (=uninfected) program, so viruses "steal" also
legal rights from both the originator and the user (who looses the guarantee,
if any, of a working program :-)

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Mr. Frigerio's response <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Thanks to everybody who replied on the subject of Swiss Anti-Virus Legislation.

As somebody noticed there was a word missing in the English translation. It
should have been: "... destructs electronically or similarly saved or
TRANSMITTED data will..."

The text posted to the net, was a trial to include into the "data damaging"
even creation and dealing/circulating computer viruses. The idea behind this,
is that the virus itself already carries the malicious intent of his author.
Therefore it is dangerous in any circumstance. Actually a virus can not be
abused, as the idea of abuse includes the possibility, that a virus can be
used in a good way too. As I have been told by specialists, there is no such
"good use" of a virus as any unauthorized change of data has the potential of
interfering with other data and/or programs in environments, that the virus
author did/could not foresee. And even the unauthorized use of storage space
is a damage, as this space will not be available for authorized uses of the
computer system. Computer virus are an "absolute danger", and as any other
dangerous thing (like explosive, poison, radioactive materials or genetic
materials in specialized labs) computer virus should not be created or
circulated without restrictions.

It has been remarked that in the text there was no word about the requisite
intent or requisite knowledge of the committer. This way any BBS sysop would
always risk criminal charges, if his BBS carries any virus infected software
but the sysop isn't aware of it.

I apologize for not having told that Swiss Penal Law only considers
intentional crimes, if there is no explicit indication that negligent acts are
punished too. Therefore according to Swiss Penal Law terminology and system,
the text posted to the net only considers who "knowingly and willingly"
commits the act. That means that the author of the virus has to know it was a
virus, what he created: this is always the case. And who circulates the virus
has to know it was a virus and he wanted to circulate it. The knowledge that
SW was or carried a virus can be proved easily by the fact that nobody
knowingly stores viruses without labeling or marking them in any way, in order
not to be infected himself (yes, I know: if there really is somebody so
foolish, I have to find another way to prove his knowledge). For BBS a "Virus
Directory" containing viruses or virus source codes is evidence enough for the
"requisite knowledge and intent". The law does no want to punish accidental
distribution of viruses.

The phrase "means destined for unauthorized deletion" has been considered
unclear. "Means" certainly includes not only software, but source code (on
paper as on disks) too. It has been remarked that it's the classical toolmaker
problem: a knife can be used as woodcarver to make a great work, but it might
be used by a thug to commit murder.  I realized this problem, but would you
consider a knife as generally destined to commit murder? Or would you consider
explosive as generally destined to create damage? We have to be aware that
most items can be used in a legal or abused in an illegal way.  Seldom an item
can only be used in an illegal way, but computer viruses are such items!  I do
not speak about software using virus specific reproduction techniques (like
"killer viruses" for copyright enforcement or "anti-viruses" supposed to fight
viruses) that make data changes with the explicit (contract/license) or
implicit (highly probable agreement of the user) authorization of the user.
This kind of SW is actually not included in the definition of "means destined
for unauthorized deletion, modification, or destruction of data".  Therefore
you cannot say that Norton Utilities, WipeFile or any other similar general
purpose SW or utilities are "destined for unautorized deletion, modification
or destruction", although they certainly could be used for this.

The text doesn't say anything about malice, malicious intents or the intent to
damage, as these elements are very difficult to prove in trial, if the accused
denies any such intention. Actually I considered these subjective elements as
not really necessary, as the virus already carries the malicious intent of its
author: the malice of the author is proved by his virus, and the malice of
somebody circulating the virus is proved, if his knowledge, that he was
circulating a virus, is proved.

According to general principles of penal law the site of crime is the main
link to charge somebody. If a virus has been created or circulated outside the
national borders of Switzerland, Swiss Penal law cannot be applied. But if a
virus created outside Switzerland is transferred electronically to
Switzerland, the downloader will be held responsible, no matter if he was in
Switzerland or abroad, as "importing" as a way to circulate the virus.  The
"success" of the act will take place in Switzerland. Anyway Art. 7 of Swiss
Penal Law follows the principle of territoriality and the "Ubiquitaetsprinzip"
(sorry: didn't find the correct English word: an act is considered being
committed not only where the committer was, when he started his crime, but
also where the "success" has been realized. Anyway I do consider clarifying
this by inserting that "importing" virus is considered as "circulating in any
way".

As this crime is prosecuted as soon as police or prosecution authority knows
about it (so called "ex officio", there is no need for a specific complaint: a
detailed information about a fact is enough to start investigations, no matter
where the information came from (e.g. abroad).

There is no doubt, that professional ant-virus specialists and scientists
should have access to viruses and be allowed to even create viruses. As long
as this is covered by the aim of studying strategies to fight computer
viruses, this is OK. I actually planned a system of registering these people
with a federal authority (e.g. the IS Security Dptm. at the Swiss Federal
Office of Information Technology and Systems or the Ministry of Justice). The
posted text would be then need to be completed as follows: "Who, without being
registered with the proper federal authority, creates...  Only trustworthy
individuals, who are professionally or scientifically active in combatting
such means, may be registered on demand."

The Swiss legislator is actually not only considering "data damaging" but
"hacking", "time theft" and computer fraud too, but these ARE NOT subjects of
the discussion in this forum now. The same applies to software piracy, already
ruled by another law. I will gladly email/fax the German, French or Italian
text of the Penal Law draft to anybody interested. Please do not ask me an
English translation of these, as I am not a professional English translator of
legal text.

I am aware that the UK and Italy have/are going to have laws allowing to
prosecute the creation and circulation of computer viruses. If anybody knows
of other countries, may he please let me know in any way and as soon as
possible.

On Monday, 25 October 1993, there will a meeting with the Ministry of Justice
in order to convince them to propose this to the Parliament. This will be very
very difficult, as there generally is very little knowledge on, or concern for
the threat through computer viruses. Most people have simply never suffered an
attack of computer viruses.

Thanks again for following this item with your comments.
