I am chair of USACM, which is the new U.S. Public Policy Committee of ACM.
A few months ago we asked Steve Kent to chair a panel that would study
encryption policy in the U.S. and produce a report for ACM.  As Dorothy
mentions, she is on the panel, together with several other illustrious
individuals, including the esteemed moderator of RISKS.  I have included the
list of panelists at the end of this note.  CPSR is no more a member of the
panel than are the National Security Agency or the Department of Justice.
The panel does have members who are affiliated with all three organizations.

I am certain that Dorothy did not intend to give the impression that the
ACM panel has decided that ACM will not have a public position on Clipper.
However, since her email might have been misinterpreted by some readers,
I want to clarify that, while ACM has not taken a position on Clipper,
there has not been any decision made within ACM of which I am aware that
prevents ACM from taking a position at some future time.  In addition,
it is my understanding that there has been no final determination made by
the panel of precisely what the report will or will not contain.

Barbara Simons, Chair USACM

The members of the ACM encryption policy panel are:

  Dr. Clint Brooks, National Security Agency
  Scott Charney, Department of Justice
  Dr. Dorothy Denning, Georgetown University

Dorothy Denning has raised important questions about the Clipper proposal.  As
she says "the issues are extremely complex and difficult."  Below I've tried
to answer the points she has raised.  I apologize in advance to RISKS readers
who know all of this.

Please read her comments and my response.  Speak with others interested in the
Clipper proposal.  If on balance, after reviewing the arguments, you decide
Clipper is a mistake then you should express your opposition by sending a
message to:

     CLIPPER.PETITION@CPSR.ORG

The letter to the President makes clear that we are concerned about "Clipper
and associated standards" which include the Capstone EES configuration for
data transmission.

It is clearly the intent of the EES proposal to cover both voice and data
transmissions.

This is a little bit like saying that leaving a master key for every house on
your block with the police will not make it easier for the police to open
locked doors.

We may disagree about whether this is a good idea, but let's be clear about
the intent of the proposal.

The NSA is responsible for foreign signal interception.  It has no legal
authority to conduct wire surveillance.  What are the NSA's "national

To the best of my knowledge, there has never been a proposed technical
standard that generated more opposition.  Firms across the telecommunications
and computer industry oppose Clipper.  Computer security people and
cryptographers oppose Clipper.  Privacy experts oppose Clipper.

Dorothy endorsed the proposal before she joined the "review" team.  The group
that she refers to, a White House task force, has an interesting history.  The

Senator Frank Church, who conducted the most extensive hearings ever held on
the National Security Agency, said that the NSA's intelligence gathering
capabilities were important for the security of the United States.  He also
said that the massive eavesdropping capability created "A tremendous potential
for abuse." If ever turned against the communications system of the United
States:

The original replacement for DES, proposed by the Department of Commerce in
1989, would have had these characteristics:

-- public, unclassified
-- implementable in both hardware or software
-- usable by federal Agencies and U.S. based multi-national corporation
-- a level of security sufficient for the protection of unclassified, 
   sensitive information and commercial propriety and/or valuable information.

The final proposal, developed with the "technical assistance" of the NSA, has
these characteristics.

-- The Clipper algorithm Skipjack is classified
-- Public access to the reasons underlying the proposal is restricted
-- Skipjack can be implemented only in tamper-proof hardware 
-- It will not be used by multi-national corporations
-- The security of the configuration remains unproven.

The Computer Security Act was passed precisely because the NSA tried
previously to grab civilian computer security turf.  The law was specifically
intended to control the type of abuse that results from secret
standard-setting arrangements.

If there any doubt among RISKS readers about the illegal activities of the NSA
in the development of the EES, please consult the minutes of the NSA/NIST
Technical Working Group (TWG) that produced the standard.  The minutes should
be available from the National Security Agency Public Information Office.

The statement is illogical.  There is still no evidence to support the FBI's
claims.

The FBI made certain claims that cryptography was impeding criminal
investigation conducted by wiretap.  CPSR investigated the FBI's claims by
filing a Freedom of Information Act suit to obtain the relevant documents.
The documents provided to us by the Department of Justice revealed that none
of the FBI field officers had encountered any obstacles.  The Department of
Justice has just informed us that they provided to us all relevant documents
concerning the Clipper proposal.

There is one reported case where cryptography made it difficult for law
enforcement to obtain evidence. That case concerned reading the contents of a
file on a hard disk after it was seized.

If this is the problem that the Clipper proposal is intended to solve, then
the key escrow scheme must be extended to every single encrypted file -- not
just encrypted communications -- everywhere in the world.

Every encrypted file. Everywhere.

An FBI legislative proposal now under consideration at the White House would

This premise, if accepted, would mean that people in the United States would
have no right to express political views when the government claimed "national
security." Certainly, there are matters of national security that must be
protected, but when an agency with expertise in wire surveillance develops a
secret standard for eavesdropping and tells those who raise questions that
there are matters of national security that they would not understand, there
is good reason for concern.

Subject: Re: Campaign and Petition Against Clipper

I would like to comment upon a few points raised by Dr. Denning:

>The decisions that have been made were not made lightly.

While I appreciate the sentiments expressed by Dr. Denning here, I'm
sure that those who oppose the Clipper initiative are also intelligent and
have also worked very hard to make their concerns known.  I have studied this
issue actively and I assure you that I did not sign the petition "lightly".

>The standard (FIPS 185) is not a standard for the Internet or any other high
>speed computer network.

While the Clipper initiative only covers the phone system, the entire proposal
(Clipper and Capstone and the key escrow system) will touch the high-speed
networks and should be taken as a whole.

>...assuming
>the communications are not superencrypted with something else.  Law
>enforcers still need to get a court order just to intercept the
>communications in the first place...

There are two points to address here.  First, it is currently very difficult
to produce and export cryptographic software of any significant strength due
to export controls.  A private entity which has the resources to produce a
strong cryptographic solution will have to invest a great deal to produce such
software.  The current export controls would make it impossible for such an
entity to compete on the world market, thus limiting profit, possibly to the
point of non-profitability.  This makes superencryption pretty unlikely, and
this is one of the purposes of the current export controls on encryption.
Also at issue is whether the government will outlaw non-Clipper/Capstone/Key
Escrow encryption entirely.

Second, law enforcement needs to get a court order to intercept phone
communications.  I know of no such need to get a court order to intercept
communications on a high speed network w.r.t. Capstone.  The current
administration proposal does not require a court order to get the escrowed
keys themselves.

Currently the community which is informed on this issue is rather small.  It
is unclear whether that population of 250 million would support the initiative
if they were fully informed.  Assuming the people which responded to the
Commerce Department solicitation is representative of the public at large,
it is clear that this is not a popular initiative outside of government/
law enforcement/national security circles.

>I have been one of the reviewers of the standard.  We have completed our

I'm sure that the committee which reviewed the algorithm made as accurate
an assessment of the algorithm they could in the limited time they were given.
What the NSA refuses to answer on this point is whether it, or the rest of the
national security community will use the escrow system.  If the [national
security] community does not sign up [for the key escrow system], then the
escrow system will be effectively compromised.

>...I am not aware of any recent evidence
>that the NSA is engaging in illegal intercepts of Americans...

From what I understand, the Act was passed in response to the incident in the
1970s.  Just because one doesn't have evidence doesn't mean that abuses don't
exist, and one can't make basic policy decisions based upon that.  When
considering important policy like this, one has to actively consider the risks
of abuse.

>...

From what current reports show, NSA pushed the proposal through NIST, and it
was NSA, not NIST, which was the true author and sponsor of the initiative.
They were operating on a "gray area" where because they were the only source
for the standard considered, they effectively set the standard without
explicitly violating the law.

>...  I can tell you that it

Dr. Denning, would you, as a service to RISKS readers, disclose your evidence
of how encryption has hampered criminal investigations?  And how often?  And
what kind of investigations were hampered?

>...  In the absence of understanding the national security issues, I
>believe we need to exercise some caution in believing that we can understand
>the full implications of encryption on society.

I disagree and Dr. Denning contradicts herself.  If the decision is made at
those levels, the public will not be informed.  This policy is too important
to relegate to a back room.

It apparently came close to covering everything.  I have heard from several

In any case, that point may be somewhat moot because Capstone applies to data!

The language sounds to me like it covers ISDN which is rapidly becoming the
standard for non-local networking, all switched circuits, which will soon
include most cable systems, and standard commercial modems carry the vast
majority of all current computer communications.  What do you think the
superhighway is going to be made of?  We have AT+T trying for the twisted pair
as the standard, and the cable companies going for a cable version, and some
chasing optical, but it is all circuit switched at one point or another.

> ...  The standard will make it much

For someone who lived through Watergate and Irangate and all the other
gates, I am amazed that you can still take this position.  It only means
that the class of people who will be able to get the information will be
restricted to the richer and more powerful.  Anyone familiar with the
telephone system today knows that to tap a line requires only that the FBI
tell the telephone company the phone number.  The rest happens in a matter
of seconds.  With clipper, it will be the same way.

> ...  Keys are escrowed so that if someone uses this technology, they cannot

How much do these escrow agents get paid, and how well are their families
protected?  How many guards watch them continuously? Who are we kidding?
US Nuclear codes were leaked to the Soviets at the height of the cold war.
Do you really think that we will protect these escrow agents any better?

>As near as I know, neither CPSR nor any other group has conducted any
>systematic poll ...

I know for a fact that most of the major telecommunications providers are
worried that Clipper will be made the standard.  The reason is that they need
better protection and they have to be able to do more things more flexibly
than Clipper allows.  They also don't want to have to pay the company who
makes clipper a fortune to use a technology they don't want to use.

>Hundreds of people is hardly overwhelming in a population of 250 million ...

Do you claim to believe that the great silent majority is in favor of Clipper?
Actually, hundreds of people who opposed it against only a few who supported
it would tend to indicate that 245 Million oppose it and 5 million are in
favor.  Not that this was a statistically valid sample.  After all, the people
who oppose it are probably more knowledgeable than the general public.

>... concluded it was very strong.  ...

In the light of 5,000 years of cryptographic history where experts claimed
that systems were very strong only to find them broken soon after, I find it
hard to trust the hand picked committee of 5 so-called experts who are given
money and time to pass judgement on a technology that is so weak that they are
afraid to expose it to the light of day.  If it is so strong, why not let the
rest of the world review it? The German experts said the same thing about
Enigma, and lots of US experts said the same thing about <name withheld> for
national security reasons.  The infoscape is littered with failed
cryptosystems and failed experts wo trusted them.

>...  I do not believe that our requirements for protecting private

It is hard to believe that such a well known expert is that naive.  It is the
blind belief in government that allows it to get away with so much.  We need
more questioning, not less.  We need affirmative facts that show they are
not doing this before we will believe it.  Just because they haven't been
caught, doesn't mean they are innocent.

>The 5 of us who reviewed the algorithm unanimously agreed that it was very

I disagree strongly with this assertion.  The mere fact that 5 experts agree
that a technology is strong gives me no confidence whatsoever.  If it is so
strong, what's the big secret? If it's so strong, why does it have to be
protected by a special hardware mechanism? If it is so strong, why not tell
all of us so we can start to develop similar systems of our own? How can you
claim it is so strong when you are afraid to even tell us how it works?
History has shown that secret systems such as these are not strong.  The
evidence I use to condemn is 5,000 years of history.  Your evidence is 5
people in a room saying it's strong.  Which should we give more weight to?

>...  I can tell you that it

If technology hampers criminal investigations, why not eliminate cars except
for police.  Then we could catch a lot more criminals.  This is a stupid
argument.  Let's get better police and better tools for them to use, and not
try to weaken the very fabric of our information society instead.

This is the argument of dictators, not democracies.  If it cannot be opened
to public scrutiny, it does not belong here.  The implications of controlled
encryption are the ones you are afraid of airing.  But I am not.  Controlled
encryption is just another way for those with power to tighten their grip.
What is so frightening to you about encryption that you can't even discuss
it? Is it that people will have privacy from their own government? Is it that
we will be able to assure integrity in communications?  Giving power to the
public is not something to be feared.  It is something to be sought out and
encouraged.

Why is it that you think you understand more about the implications of
cryptography on national security than the rest of us? This elitist crap has
got to end.  It is bad for our country to have elitists who believe they know
more than the rest of us dictating how we will live our lives.  It is bad for
our country that the esteemed members of this forum do not have access to your
rational in order to openly discuss your points of view.  It is bad for our
country that professors at universities tell their students and the public not
to think about the issues, but to trust that the professors know best.  If you
want to serve the national interest, get the debate out in the open!

Subject: Clipper Chip Politics

At first I was astounded by the hysteria over the Clipper chip but have come
to the conclusion that it is really a matter of Politics and Money - technical
worth has nothing to do with it.

Have just finished reading the Cantwell Bill text on export controls and have
come to a similar conclusion. Lots of good sounding words modified by vague
exclusions. (Could not tell if PGP was permitted since all the user has to do
is install or excluded since each user must generate a unique key).

Clearly, if I were to design a custom mechanism for a client and the client
had the only copies in existence, the old rules would apply & if the client
were "offshore" I would be in violation.

According to the EFF, Mrs. Denning and I must be the only people publicly on
the net who are in favor of Clipper/Capstone as a cheap means for very simple
limited protection. It will fill the great void that exists between that which
*should* be protected and that which *is* being protected.

In the last few months, virtually every RFP I have seen deals with protection
of "Sensitive but Unclassified" information. Presently, this is done with
STU-IIIs and DES. Clunky. Ex$pen$ive. Requires effort to initiate.

Government agencies faced with field offices, telecommuting, and 
electronic filing desperately need something that is
1) Cheap
2) Easy to use
3) Blessed by the Government
4) Sufficient to deter hackers and reporters

- not because they are personally concerned about disclosure but because
public law 93-579 (Privacy Act) and public law 100-235 (Computer Security Act)
says they *will*. And for these uses Clipper/Capstone is *good enough* (C).

People bemoan the fact that the government is creating a self-indulgent
monopoly, but I have not seen anyone else rushing to fill the gap (three years
ago I outlined both in magazines and at conferences a very simple means for
access tokens/smart cards such as those from Enigma-Logic, Racal, and
Secure-ID to be used to securely encrypt remote dial-up sessions. No one was
interested. I have not seen ads for the Beaver BCC-007 encrypted laptop
computer lately either.

To me the whole key escrow procedure is a legal sop, I fully expect certain
government agencies to be able to break any transmission within seconds given
the right equipment and all of the keys (not necessarily who has which, just
*all* of them), but I do not really care since anything that needs more
protection will just receive stronger encryption before C/C ever sees it. The
real value is for authentication and protection from volume analysis. (Today,
it is easy to tell which of my missives are protected and which are not. How
much and where can be valuable information even without reading the contents.
With C/C you will have to decode everything to find out which is important and
which is a take-away order).

The NSA/FBI meeting at Bellcore included an assertion that a "National
Laboratory" would be required to reverse engineer the chip.  Does anyone think
that it would not be easier/cheaper to simply buy someone on the inside ?
"Security by Obscurity" may be effective for short durations and limited value
objectives but we are talking strategic value here.

Thus in my opinion, the whole broohah is a smoke-screen. C/C is going to
happen, it will do what it is supposed to, it will become a standard since it
is going to be cheap and enough, and some organizations are going to make
billions of dollars off it - that is just the American Way.

I still want some to play with.  Padgett

Subject: Re: Campaign and Petition Against Clipper

In RISKS-15.48, Dorothy Denning combines some good points with some very
paternalistic and unsupportable claims.  I will primarily address the latter.

>... The Clipper initiative is the result of
>considerable deliberation by many intelligent people who appreciate and
>understand the concerns that have been expressed and who worked hard to
>accommodate the conflicting interests.  The decisions that have been made were
>not made lightly.

In other words, despite the fact that many intelligent and well-informed
people *oppose* Clipper, "we know best, so stop complaining."  The fact that
the decision was made by well-intentioned people does not make it correct.

>The standard (FIPS 185) is not a standard for the Internet or any other high
>speed computer network.  It is for the telephone system.

In the first place, many people access the Internet via various forms of
telephone lines.  If they are encrypted, it will be easier to tap them if they
use Clipper.  In the second place, the Administration has been quite up-front
about its desire to force key-escrow encryption into nearly every encryption
application.  So while Ms. Denning is technically correct in her narrow
reading of the document, CPSR is equally correct in raising an alarm about the
larger issue of high-speed networks.

>As near as I know, neither CPSR nor any other group has conducted any
>systematic poll ...

Ah, the old "silent majority" argument.  I thought that went out when Nixon
resigned.

The truth is that, among the tiny fraction of the public which has expressed
an opinion, there *has* been overwhelming public opposition.  Very few people
have written the Government to say, "my, what a wonderful idea!"

Organizations like TV networks have a multiplier rule they apply to letters,
where they figure that every letter received represents N people who felt the
same way, but didn't take the time to write.  To suggest that only one's
opposition took the time to write, and that everyone else is in agreement, is
at best disingenuous and at worst intellectually dishonest.

> The ACM is in the process of
>conducting a study on encryption.  CPSR is a member of the study group, as am
>I.  Steve Kent is chair.  Our goal is a report that will articulate the
>issues, not a public statement either for or against.

In other words, having attempted to discredit what little data we *do* have,
Ms. Denning is stating that there are no plans to conduct a scientific study
of public opinion.  Perhaps the ACM or the CPSR should fund Roper or Gallup to
investigate a few questions, approved by both Ms. Denning and a CPSR
representative as being unbiased?

> The International Association for Cryptologic Research has not to my
> knowledge made any official statement about Clipper.

I don't see what relevance this has to anything.  One organization of
cryptologists has remained silent.  So what?

> Hundreds of people is hardly overwhelming in a population of 250 million,

The first part of this statement is patently false; the same argument
could be applied to any Harris poll.  The second part, about "form
letter" distortions in public issues, is relevant and important.  All
the more reason to do a more scientific survey.

The 1978 act was passed in response to the abuses of the early 70's.  It
should not have been necessary, since the NSA was prohibited from domestic
spying even before that, but the NSA figured that since the cables involved
were international communications, it was OK to eavesdrop on them.  This is a
rather classic case illustrating the way the NSA used the loosest possible
interpretation of restrictions, rather than actively trying to respect the
privacy of law-abiding citizens.

> I am not aware of any recent evidence
> that the NSA is engaging in illegal intercepts of Americans.

Once burned, twice cautious.  Ms. Denning, think of the egg you'll have on
your face if the NSA gets caught misbehaving a few years from now.
Personally, I don't see why I should trust any person or agency that is so
secretive.

The question is of who was in control.  There is a world of difference between
drawing on "advice and assistance," and stepping out of the picture to let
someone else do the job.  I believe that the latter is what CPSR is worried
about.

> ... I can tell you that it
> is a fact that new communications technologies, including encryption, have
> hampered criminal investigations.

Without data or references, how are we to believe this?  CPSR carried out, at
great difficulty, some preliminary research.  There is no indication that they
selected that data, and I hope that Ms. Denning is not suggesting this.
Again, we have an attempt to invoke the "silent majority" argument to claim
that the sampled data is invalid.  Only this time Ms. Denning doesn't even
offer anything to back up her counterclaim.

In the first place, let's have some facts here.  What criminal
investigations have been hampered by new technologies?  How many?

In the second place, a pervasive thread in Ms. Denning's thinking seems to be
that there is no room for a tradeoff between law enforcement and freedom.  Let
me point out that crime would drop tremendously if the police were allowed to
search anyone's home at random, without warning, and to confiscate anything
they chose.  But I don't think I'd want to live in such a society.  Similarly,
I'm perfectly willing to let a few criminal investigations be "hampered" or
even fail, if it means I can use strong encryption without fear of
eavesdropping or prosecution.

> The standard is voluntary -- even for the government.

That's not what I remember.  I seem to recall that the original announcement
said that the standard would be applicable to all government agencies.  Is
there a citation to support the claim that it's voluntary within the
government?

As to outside the government, yes, it's voluntary.  For now.  But there are
already major pressures being applied to make sure that this "voluntary"
standard is the only practical choice.  For example, Clipper will be much
easier to export than RSA, Idea, or even the venerable Enigma.  Government
dollars are being used to make sure that the Clipper chip is available and
cheap, undercutting the possibility of fair free-market competition.  And
hints have been dropped that any future encryption made available to the
public will also require a key escrow scheme.
