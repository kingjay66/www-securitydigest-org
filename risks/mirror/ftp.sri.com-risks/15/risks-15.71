Subject: Risks of washroom automation (Erma Bombeck)

Here's one paragraph of Erma Bombeck's humour column, The Kingston
Whig-Standard, 28 March 1994.

	"I dropped by an airport washroom.  In my stall, I wrestled
	with my jumpsuit, and in doing so the belt fell into the
	commode.  Before I could retrieve it, the automatic flusher
	sucked it away and into the sewers of San Jose.  I held my
	hands under the automatic water tap and went for a paper
	towel.  I turned in time to see my handbag fall into the
	sink and activate the water.  It proceeded to drown."

The column also enumerates many other more familiar problems with
automation.

Subject: Pay-per-View failure lets adult station go unscrambled

Cable company adds unexpected Spice to subscriber's dinner hour.

A problem with a pay-per-view system caused all customers of the Greater
Media Cable TV service in Worcester Massachusetts to receive the unscrambled
broadcast of an Adult cable cannel offered by the system.  The Spice cable
channel was unscrambled for 90 minutes between 6:00pm and 7:30pm on Monday
March 28th.

	According to a representative of the cable company, Ed Goldstien, the
cause of the glitch was not known and an investigation was in progress.
Goldstien presented the cable company's apology and promise that it would not
happen again to subscribers over the local radio station WXLO.

The Greater Media Cable system uses a call in voice response system to allow
customers to activate the pay-per-view stations offered by the system.  The
activation code for the customer's cable box is broadcast over the cable
system to unscramble the selected pay-per-view offering.  RISKS readers could
speculate that this incident is an indication that a universal activation
code must exist for all cable decoders in the system.  We could further
speculate that the voice response system could have broadcast this code in
response to a pay-per-view request of a single subscriber if internal tables
were faulty.

The RISK here is dependence on an automatic system to save cost when the cost
of its failure is not taken into account.

Subject: Role-playing Addiction

Washington Post Staff Writer John Schwartz has published a moving and
insightful article entitled, "Game Boy."  It explores the life and death of
an eighteen year old man addicted to cyberspace role-playing.  I have asked
Mr Schwartz for permission to post the original article in its entirety.  For
the time being, here's a brief summary.

<<begin summary>>

Nathaniel Davenport was an unassertive, socially-isolated teenager who did
poorly in high school but had excellent S.A.T. scores.  He entered the
University of California at Santa Cruz autumn 92 and quickly became active in
AmberMUSH, a M.U.D. (multi-user dimension) loosely based on the _Amber_
stories of Roger Zelazny.  AmberMUSH "features a series of mirrors that you
walk through into different elaborate fictional situations: One is the ruins
of a city; another a rowdy Western town; a third, the smoky darkness of the
"World's End Bar," a cross-dimensional speakeasy. Wherever you go, other
players are there, gathered from around the world to engage in a collective
fantasy; you converse with whoever is in the `room' you are in at the time,
something like a pickup game in basketball."

Nathaniel became a M.U.D. addict.  He was asked to leave his university
because he had missed all of his classes while living in AmberMUSH.  Back in
Virginia, he continued his addiction through student terminals at George
Mason University, where he would spend entire days interacting with other
role players from around the world.

Nathaniel's persona in AmberMUSH was Sabbath, a beautiful seductress devoid
of empathy for the characters she manipulated.  For example, she spent months
seducing another character, only to goad him to his death in a battle with a
more powerful character.

After bitter arguments with his family, Nathaniel agreed to get a job.  He
began working at a computer company from 5 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.  He incorporated
his new job into his frenetic role-playing life by skimping on sleep.  A week
after starting work, he apparently fell asleep at the wheel of his mother's
car and smashed head-on into a truck.  He died instantly.

When Nathaniel's father sent out requests for correspondence on the Internet,
addressing the AmberMUSH users his son had spent so much of his life with, he
was astonished at the volume and quality of the responses.

Over time, Tom Davenport came to believe that Nathaniel's interactions were
not futile game-playing or pornographic flirting.  "[I]n his quest to better
himself, Nathaniel had also turned to the tool he was most comfortable with:
He was using his character to explore social interactions, to learn to be
funny, charming, direct. `He was using the net,' says Davenport, `to work out
his life.'"

"Contacted via e-mail, AmberMUSH administrator Mark Grundy said the death of
Nathaniel Davenport has made him think hard about players' responsibility to
one another in the on-line society. `The future for human relationships in
the Communication Age seems particularly uncertain,' Grundy wrote. `For me,
the lesson that Tom has taught is that the answers can come, if you look for
them with the right heart.'"

<<end summary>>

This young man, isolated from a local community, unhappy in his own skin,
found happiness as a different person in a different world.  The pity is that
he lost touch with his own body's needs.

Like a rat on an endorphin high, poor Nathaniel died from addiction to his
own form of satisfaction.  Should we shrug and dismiss his death?  "It's his
problem--he was free to act as he chose."  Surely, but could anyone in his
cyberspace community have helped avoid this sad end, crushed uselessly at the
age of 18?  I wonder if cyberspace role-players will reach out to accept and
support the tangible person behind the electronic persona?  Would it have
helped if someone had asked how Nathaniel was doing instead of focusing only
on Sabbath?

As human beings interact electronically, we will be forced to integrate
morality and reason into cyberspace.  Cyberspace must not remain a moral
vacuum; common sense must grow to encompass all the ways we now have to touch
other people's lives and alter our own.

JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer, reports on the Software Publishers
Association's statistics concerning software theft.  Key findings:

o	Worldwide losses of $7.4 billion for business software in 1993.

o	Rate is down 25% from $9.7 billion in 1992.

o	Business software (spreadsheets, electronic mail, accounting and 
data base programs) sales revenues in 1993 were $6.8 billion.

o	Companies whose employees make unauthorized copies or put single-copy
programs on network servers account for the most frequent violations of
software copyright.

o	The SPA audited or initiated lawsuits against 245 companies, all of
which were resolved out of court.

o	Settlements totalled $3 million.

o	Manufacturers in the U.S. lost $1.57 billion; Japan lost $650 million;
France lost $435 million.

o	Software theft grew fastest in India and Pakistan (up 95%); Korea and
Brazil showed 89%, and Malaysia's theft grew 88%.

Subject: Risks of spelling checkers

I was recently quite shocked (UK: gob-smacked) to find that an event 
connected with my spell checker could have put me at risk of losing my job. 
I was editing a publication to be sent to several hundred of my client 
contacts, and had made a series of trivial spelling corrections, the last 
being a  "replace".  Sitting poised over the replace button, I was presented 
with the suggestion that the word "Goldman" (as in a large company we all 
know) should be replaced with "goddamn". The word processor involved was MS 
Word for the Macintosh.  I then tested this on Word for Windows, and got the 
same result.  (I have the `always suggest' option selected) 
 
This event scared me greatly, because it is easy to go unconscious in front 
of the mouse and press "replace" one too many times without realizing the 
result.  I contacted my support agency and was told that "goddamn" is in the 
main dictionary, and that I could not delete it from the main dictionary.  It 
was suggested that I program Goldman as a replacement to goddamn. 
 
Of course, defining a replacement in this one case does not assure me that
the "bad" word will not be suggested in the future for other replacements.
And, I have not yet encountered other unprofessional and undesirable word
replacements which I would grudgingly agree that, in an academic sense,
belong in the dictionary, but are a risk to my job.  Yet, I wait in fear of
these discoveries.
 
My concern here is that products such as word processors that are sold for 
use in "business" applications should either not freely suggest profane words 
in the main dictionary, or should have an option to leave them out or supply 
an extra warning.  Obviously, the problem is further complicated by words or 
phrases that have different meanings in different countries even when the 
language seems otherwise equivalent. 
 
Has anyone else had problems similar to this?  Are there any alternative 
"business-oriented" main dictionaries which can be purchased to eliminate the 
risk?  And, should I be obligated to live-with/fix this problem when 
purchasing a "business" product?

The RISKS archives are full of cases such as transforming a Mafia "enforcer"
into an "informer", "payout" into "peyote", "back in the black" to "back in
the AfroAmerican", and many other garbles.  And I just happen to notice a note
from Abhijit Chaudhari <abhijit@sware.com> in the YUCKS digest (from
spaf@cs.purdue.edu) noting that NeXTSTEP 3.0 Webster's barfs on "UNIX", and
offers "unfix" instead.  That is not Unix-friendly, although I distinctly
recall Steve Jobs suggesting at the San Francisco birth announcement for NeXT
that NeXT was UNIX-emulatable and UNIX-friendly (but that nobody would care
once they had seen NeXT!).  I wonder what that spelling corrector does to
NeXT?  Maybe it gets turned into a NeWT.

Subject: Busy-waiting woes

A few years back, I was working as a student computer consultant at UC Santa
Cruz.  The San Diego Supercomputer Center was pulling itself up by its
bootstraps, and a few of the researchers at UCSC had won grants of CPU time
on SDSC's CRAY Y/MP.

SDSC sent some of their tech. support staff up to Santa Cruz to give our
researchers a quick introduction to UNICOS (CRAY's flavor of SYSV UNIX) and
SDSC's special features.  Needless to say, they didn't want to leave their
tech support people in Santa Cruz, so they gave us a small grant for our
consultants to use while learning their system.  I was one of the lucky
consultants who got to participate.

So far so good.

At the same time, one of my friends was finishing up his physics thesis (a
weird little study of aerodynamic surfaces), and had written a small flight
simulator to do some of his calculations.  This study was weird enough that my
friend was calling his programs 'funny', 'goofy', 'damgoofy', etc.  It was a
simple program which simulated the flight of a plane for a short duration, and
the user couldn't adjust any control surfaces after the program started.

As a favor to him and as a convenient way to learn more about the Y/MP,
I ported his program over to UNICOS.

The program normally asked the user for its parameters when it started up,
printed the results to the terminal, and waited for the user to hit return
before quitting.  The program was almost entirely math, so all I had to do was
convert it to batch processing.  Simple: just change a few scanf()'s to
fscanf()'s, tweak a few paths, and we're all set....  Or so I thought.
(ominous background music, please).

I ftp'd the files over to the cray, compiled them, and made a few short test
runs.  No problems.  So I set it up to calculate 30 seconds of flight at 1ms
intervals, and to print out the time when it started and stopped.  Then I set
it loose.  It was truly impressive watching those columns of numbers scrolling
by.  But alas, my next class was starting, so I couldn't wait for it to
finish.  I was capturing the output to a file anyway, so I just disconnected
and went to my class.

That was Friday evening.

Sunday morning rolls around, and I get rudely shaken from bed by a phone call
at 7am!  Imagine the nerve!  hmph.  It was SDSC's support staff calling.  It
seems that a renegade program had eaten up all the consultant's time grant
by running continuously (100% CPU usage) for 35 hours in the interactive
`batch` queue!  Clearly this program was intended as some warped prank,
considering it was called 'damgoofy'!  Uh-oh.  I was sure there was some kind
of mistake, so I rushed up to campus to see what had happened.

It turns out that I had forgotten to remove the program's last gets(): that's
the line which made the simulator wait for the user to hit return before
quitting.  That shouldn't have been a problem in itself, since the function
should've immediately returned with an error after it discovered it had lost
it's terminal (when I logged out).  It didn't.  No problem, right?  The
program should've just stopped waiting for input, consuming no CPU resources.
Nope.  Under that version of UNICOS, the program was waiting in a busy-loop,
uselessly using the CPU while it waited for input.  :(   Ooooops!

Luckily SDSC was nice to us, and the Y/MP was underutilized back then anyway,
so they just refunded the money, my friend got an impressive simulation, and
I got an anecdote.  :)

Subject: Recent useful newspaper pieces on crypto policy

Two interesting newspaper articles on encryption policy recently appeared:

In The Australian, an influential national newspaper similar to The Guardian
in the U. K. or The New York Times in the U. S., a large article describes
the Clipper chip controversy including a bit more technical detail than is
common for U. S. newspapers.  Professor Bill Caelli of Queensland University
of Technology's School of Data Communications is quoted as saying "Is Clipper
the start of a more onerous agenda?  Does Clipper represent attempts to
outlaw the use of encryption in any form by the public unless he or she uses
an 'approved' (and breakable) cipher system such as Clipper?  This last
question is a far darker scenario and goes to the very heart of freedom and
privacy in a democratic society."  -- All this in The Australian of 29 March
1994.

In the New York Times of 26 March 1994, on the first page of the second
section and wrapping around to page 26, there is an article "Collisions in
Cyberspace on Data Encryption Plan" which starts "To paraphrase Oscar Wilde,
the Clinton Administration threw a couple of its lions into a den of savage
Daniels here this week" (now last week).  That refers to the Fourth
Conference on Computers, Freedom, and Privacy in Chicago, and the article
appears under a wonderful photo of Emmanuel Goldstein, editor of 2600, clad
in T-shirt, etc., taling with Frank Carey of Bell Labs, replete in coat and
tie, but holding beer bottle.  The article goes on to describe an arrest of a
man in the conference hotel (actually a conference attendee) who fit the
description of fugitive hacker Kevin Mitnick and the rough go Dave Lytel of
the President's Office of Science and Technology Policy had as the keynote
speaker trying to defend Clipper.

>They had 911 on speed dial?  Come on - that's inexcusable, given how easy it

Not when the phone manufacturer provides speed dial buttons explicitly
labelled for that purpose.  I own a General Electric phone (purchased about
five years ago) that has three buttons on it labelled "Fire", "Police", and
"Ambulance".

There are other risks associated with such a phone, in addition to
that of pets (or small children) accidentally hitting one of those
buttons.  The buttons need to be programmed with the correct number,
since 911 is not (yet) universal in the US.  If the owner of a phone
does not set the numbers for those buttons - or worse, moves without
changing the numbers (where one of the old or new locations does not
have 911) - one could picture a scenario where a guest is present, the
phone's owner is incapacitated, and the guest tries to use the "Ambulance"
button to contact same...

Subject: Banknotes and photocopiers

In RISKS-15.70, Tom Standage noted that some color photocopiers prevent
forgery by reacting to the color shift in the ink.  This seems similar to how
our Xerox black-and-white copiers react to an American Express card.  The
cards apparently use two different inks for the pattern filling the face of
the card, one of which is invisible to the copier, although both inks look
identical to the eye.  When photocopied, the card image bears the word VOID
all over its face (this is the green card; haven't tried it with a gold or
platinum one).  Perhaps a similar technology is involved in preventing copying
of currency.

Subject: Re: IRS persistence (Methvin, RISKS-15.70)

This is not a good idea. What happened to me, basically, was that I closed my
old VISA account with the State Bank Victoria (Australia) with 4 cents
credit, <CREDIT, not debit>, believing I was a good guy for not trying to get
the money out - after all, it probably costs VISA $x per transaction.  Some
years later I had occasion to apply for another VISA card...

When trying to use my bank DEBIT card to pay for petrol a security alert was
flashed to the operator and my card was seized. Using my ATM card showed no
funds and my ATM card was seized. My PASSBOOK account had a security trigger
fire when I presented it at the local branch... It was all caused by the
previous VISA account; the four cents was never allowed to be reabsorbed by
the bank and my application for a new card found a bug in the validation
software that said "there is a problem with this applicant".  This
automatically put a hold on all my finances! Even the home loan joint account
was frozen.  It took TEN WORKING DAYS for a human to finally backtrack to the
root cause (the security re-asserted itself each night) I did get an official
letter of explanation (I was beyond accepting apologies) on letter-head so
future repercussions could be minimised.

What may happen to "dwm" could be something bizarre like being arrested by
the IRS for undisclosed income, not so improbable as a friend had his 1987
tax refund assessed as income for 1988!

(Did I read in RISKS about a person having $1M accidentally transferred into
 their savings account, now fighting it out with the bank over the $50,000
 funds-transfer tax?)
