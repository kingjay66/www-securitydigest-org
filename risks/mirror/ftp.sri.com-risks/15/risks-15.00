 SUBSCRIPTIONS: PLEASE read RISKS as a newsgroup on your system, if possible
 and convenient for you.  BITNET folks may use a LISTSERV (e.g., LISTSERV@UGA)
 with SUBSCRIBE RISKS or UNSUBSCRIBE RISKS as needed.  Users on US Military 
 and Government machines should contact <risks-request@pica.army.mil> (Dennis 
 Rears).  UK subscribers please contact <Lindsay.Marshall@newcastle.ac.uk>.
 Local redistribution services are provided at many other sites as well.  
 Check FIRST with your local system or netnews wizards.  If that does not
 work, send requests to <risks-request@csl.sri.com> (not automated).
