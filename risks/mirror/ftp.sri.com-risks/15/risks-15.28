Subject: Power problems stops Milano Stock Exchange for 4 hours

Yesterday, 16th of November, trading at the Milano Stock exchange started late
at 14:30 because the "telematic" system was down due to a power failure
"dating from the previous day" (I am quoting "Il Sole 24 ore", "political
economical-financial daily"). The day was bad for the market, with the "Mib"
stock index going down 2%. This is attributed to political uncertainties
coinciding with a normally bearish period of the year. A morning radio
newscast, interviewed an "expert". Excerpts (from memory): the system is
undergoing major changes as it will soon handle 100% of the trading vs 70% now
(it was not clear whether by number of transactions, of stocks or by value);
there is no reason for worry "as this was a hardware, not a software fault";
such problems are unavoidable, as "even satellites and space shuttles, with
computers that are not duplicated but _triplicated_, have had their launches
aborted due to such problems" (the interviewer sensibly asked "leave
satellites alone and tell us about stock exchanges", and the interviewee said
that comparable failures have occurred at the London, Paris, New York
exchanges. I have no information about the stated availability requirements,
the architecture of the system, and the provisions for recovery (if others
have such information, I'd appreciate it if they mailed it to me).

Subject: Lawyer discovers the RISK of computer efficiency

>From the New York Times, Friday November 12, 1993 (page B20):

At the Bar. David Margolick. "Court asks a lawyer, if a computer is doing
most of the work, why the big fee?"

[Abstracted and excerpted] Craig Collins, a lawyer in San Mateo California,
used the West CD-ROM library, a system that contains every court opinion
published in California in the last 33 years on three compact disks, to
research a parental rights case. Under penalty of perjury, he swore that he
had devoted 22 hours, ten of them over the Fourth of July weekend, to writing
several memorandums concerning the rights of step-parents in custody cases.
"At his normal rate of $225 an hour, that worked out to $4,950, part of his
total tab of $9,591.50. The money was to come from the stepfather, who lost
the case, provided it was approved by Judge Roderic Duncan of the Alameda
County Superior Court."

"That was not quite what happened. Indeed, after deconstructing the
mechanics of modern computer research, Judge Duncan not only balked,
but handed Mr. Collins to the disciplinary enforcement section of
the State Bar of California."

As it turned out, large portions of Mr. Collins memorandums were copied
directly from the court opinions, without attribution. Collins explained
that he had quoted the courts at length because "their language ``was
better written than I would have composed it myself.''" The court, however,
found that 22 hours was rather extreme for cutting and pasting since Mr.
Collins was an experienced lawyer. At the hearing, William P. Eppes II, a
representative of the West Publishing Company testified that Mr. Collins
had used the system for a total of of 9 hours and 33 minutes since he
had purchased it. The witness, who was also a lawyer, testified that it
seemed entirely plausible that Mr. Collins had put in the time he claimed.

The judge was impressed by the witness' reasoning and withdrew his claim
that Mr. Collins had not worked as long as he did. "All those hours at
the computer, the judge seemed to say, reflected inefficiency rather than
dishonesty."

Although disciplinary proceedings were dropped, Mr. Collins is still
displeased with a judge who, in an interview, he described as "a ``cavalier''
judicial ``maveric'' whose ill-considered opinions had periodically been
criticized by the California courts of appeal. How did he know? He consulted
his trusty CD-ROM, and plugged in the words ``Duncan'' and ``reversal.''"

  ["Quotes" are directly from the article. ``Quotes'' are quoted material
  in the original article.

  On the same page of the Times, you will also find an interesting article on
  modern computerized fingerprint systems. The FBI has a database of 30 million
  unique cards and performs more than 32,000 searches per day.  The modern
  systems can compare a print at rates faster than 1,000 per second.

Subject: Living Will Database

A recent item on the New York Times newswire described a patent granted to
Victor Alan Perry (date: 11-14-93 1811EST/category: Financial/ subject: BC
PATENTS/title: PATENTS: FAT SUBSTITUTE COULD BURN UP; LIVING WILL
DATABASE/author: TERESA RIORDAN).

Apparently, Mr. Perry, et alia, have been granted US patent 5,241,466 for a
"system for administering a central depository for living wills".  He
envisions an '800' number that doctors and hospitals can call.  The system
will then fax back a copy of the appropriate document (living will, durable
power of attorney, etc.) for the patient.  He would also like to extend the
system to be modem-accessible.

The purpose of the system is to save some of $10,000,000,000 which is claimed
to be spent "for artificial life support of people who did not wish to be kept
alive".

   [That would make an interesting target for computer break-ins!  PGN]

Subject: "Second Contact" by Resnick

BK2NDCNT.RVW  931014
 
Tor Books
49 West 24th Street
New York, NY   10010
"Second Contact", Resnick, 1990, U$3.95/C$4.95
 
The jacket blurb states that this book is a treat for anyone who likes
"computers, science fiction, or just a plain good read."  The "good read" part
is going to depend on personal preference:  the science fiction part seems to
be almost a side issue.  The computer enthusiasts will be presented alternately
with ideas and giggles.
 
The book is set seventy-five years into the future.  Neither politics nor
technology appears to have advanced very far and, with a publication date just
before the "Seven Days That Shook the World" (as CNN would have it), the major
national security concern of the US is still "Russian spies".  (Interestingly,
the book lists the US, Russia, China and Brazil as spacefaring nations, while
the cover shows a clear shot of a "NASA/ESA" logo on a rocket-like device.) 
Computers equipped with voice recognition still cannot deal with more than one
speaker.  At one point a computer retailer tells one character that if the
modem (what happened to ISDN?) she is trying isn't fast enough, they have one
that will transmit at "38,400 baud."  (If the author isn't just confusing baud
and "bits per second" this indicates some improvement over "voice grade" lines,
but hardly enough for the seemingly ubiquitous "vidphones" unless trellis
coding has gotten *really* sophisticated.)
 
None of the data security or communication issues raised are terribly
sophisticated.  The author has apparently never heard of telnet capabilities or
the like.  As usual in fictional accounts, the "hacker" is not only skilled
with computers, but is a phone phreak as well.
 
Two of the security topics are of some interest.  One is the account of files
being secured by "moving".  The concept of "security by obscurity" is
justifiably condemned, but it is true that leaving "standard" accounts open or
having "standard" directory and file structures is, to a certain extent, a
potential security loophole.  The next logical step, beyond putting files in a
non-standard location, is to keep moving the files.  Unfortunately, there must
be a way to retrieve the files, so somewhere there must be a pointer to them.
 
The other point regards database security.  At one stage of the plot, the
heroes are trying to track the identity of an individual who is "classified to
the max."  By using the database inference problem, they are able to pinpoint
his location.  The example is somewhat simplistic, but involves generating a
number of queries and discarding the ones the computer does *not* reject as
classified.
 
The topic of alien contact, suggested by the title, is really of relatively
minor importance.  A computer security whimsy in sf clothing.

Subject: UK government to scrap safety laws

The following is extracted from the lead article on the front page of the 14
November 1993 issue of The Independent on Sunday:

   "A RAFT of safety legislation will be scrapped in a Bill that the
  Government is to announce this week in the name of minimising costs to
  commerce and industry. It will be the biggest shake-up of health and
  safety law in 20 years. ...
    One element will be the abandonment of the longstanding assumption
  that safety legislation can only be repealed if it is replaced by
  regulations just as tough. ...
    Michael Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade, also wants to
  revoke European regulations safeguarding millions of people who work
  with computer screens. He plans to play down the risk of repetitive
  strain injury and abolish the requirement on employers to provide eye
  tests and glasses if they are needed."

As is typical in the UK, details were leaked to the press ahead of the planned
Deregulation Bill to be announced in the forthcoming Queen's Speech to
Parliament.

        "Beware the tablespoon my son,
        The teeth that bite, the Claus that catch.
        Beware the Subjects bird, and shred

        He took his Verbal sword in hand:
        Long time the monitors fog he sought,
        So rested he by the Tumbled tree,
        And stood a while in thought.
        And as in selfish thought he stood,
        The tablespoon, with eyes of Flame,
        Came stifling through the trigger wood,
        And troubled as it came!
        One, two! One, two! And through and though,
        The Verbal blade went thicker shade.
        He left it dead, and with its head,
        He went gambling back.
        "And host Thai slash the tablespoon?
        Come to my arms my bearish boy.
        Oh various day! Cartoon! Cathay!"
        He charted in his joy.

Subject: Visa introduces transaction UIDs

There is an article in The New York Times of 14 Nov 1993, Page F9, about how
Visa is (finally!!!) introducing transaction-unique IDs into its system as a
way of tracking transactions and, of course, reducing fraud. They also use the
term "digital signature", but, I presume, they are simply corrupting a
technical term by misappropriating it for another function.  They seem to mean
"unique ID", but perhaps they are also worried about spoofed transactions.
Can someone provide more information on this?

Subject: Re: CERT Reports and system breakins (Karn, RISKS-15.22)

	We need strong security mechanisms based on good cryptography
	and well thought out protocols. They're underway, but they will
	take time to develop.

In RISKS-15.22, Phil Karn suggests that the major network security issue is
the lack of good protocols.  While that's certainly a problem, I don't think
cryptographic authentication will do that much to solve the network security
problem.

Cryptography does two things: it provides secrecy if you want it, it it
provides authentication, either explicitly or implicitly, since a packet
encrypted with the wrong key will decipher to garbage.  Both will help
somewhat; properly-targeted encryption will eliminate password-sniffing, and
cryptographic authentication will allow more hosts to extend trust to users or
other hosts on a more rational basis.

However, cryptography does nothing to solve the *host* security problem.  My
incoming mail traffic could be protected by triple DES composed with quadruple
IDEA -- and it will do me no good if the mailer has bugs in its implementation
of good old RFC821 and RFC822.  Nor will Kerberos and my one-time password
help against an opponent who has sabotaged my shell, so that he or she will
get back-door access to my account and my cryptographic credentials.  After
all, the privileges that let intruders monitor Ethernets and install
boobytrapped login and telnet commands will let them change anything else on
my system.  Fixing network protocols will do nothing to guard against buggy
specifications or buggy implementations.

The real issue is one of software engineering.  At the last USENIX UNIX
Security Conference, Robert H. Morris gave the keynote address.  Its title was
on the order of ``If your software is full of bugs, what does that say about
its security?''  That's the real issue -- learning how to get *host* security
right.

Subject: Re: Ada Usage

There are real problems for which Ada is not the best language.

1. Simulation--due to the lack of support for coroutines, Simula-style
   semaphores, condition queues, call by name, and event lists,
2. Test generation--for similar reasons,
3. Multi-threaded applications with external inputs, where the usual
   tasking libraries run into problems. What happens is that the OS
   and the run-time environment sometimes need to enter messages or events
   into the same queues. Unless the library has been carefully integrated
   with the operating system, race conditions can occur, losing entries.
4. Object-oriented programming in the full sense,
5. Completion routines for inter-device protocols, and
6. Anything that needs to run close to the bare metal.

But the defense business is a very peculiar flavor of capitalism.  The

Subject: A Myth is as good as a Smile

I received a lot of out-of-band comments about L.Detweiler's piece in
RISKS-15.25, and still more asking why I devoted a whole issue (RISKS-15.27)
to the responses.  (I tend to do dedicated issues when I get an enormous
flurry of follow-ups, so that if you do not appreciate the subject matter, you
can disregard it in its entirety.)  There were many suggestions that this
topic should end immediately, which it will, I hope, with this message.  But
remember, folks, the lack of E-mail authenticity, message integrity, and
personal accountability is a real potential problem throughout the Internet,
not only on April Fools' Day.

Almost no one commented	on the original title, Snakes of Medusa.  Someone
suggested that the Hydra might have been more appropriate, the serpent that
started with nine heads and regenerated two to replace any one that was
severed.  There is a REAL multiple-identity problem.  (Medusa was the
snaky-haired Gorgon whose glance would turn you into stone.  A cheesy biography
of stoned individuals might been written by Gorgon Zola.)

At any rate, further follow-up messages from Eric Hughes and L.Detweiler can
be found in the RISKS archive on CRVAX.SRI.COM in directory RISKS: under the
file name RISKS-15.28X.  That is the end of it in RISKS.  For further
