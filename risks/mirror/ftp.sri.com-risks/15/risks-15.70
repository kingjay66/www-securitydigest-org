Subject: April Fools on the Senate

Hello ACE,

In the April issue of PC Computing, John Dvorak's column describes a Senate
Bill, supposedly introduced by Senator Leahy and co-sponsored by Sen. Kennedy,
to keep people from being intoxicated on the information highway.  The column
is an April Fools hoax and I'm sure plenty of people will find it amusing (see
below).
  
Unfortunately there are also people that are actually believing it to be true.
Our office has received several calls from outraged constituents and I
understand Leahy's staff has as well.  I originally received the article via
e-mail, and I understand that the on-line rumors are flying leading some
people to learn about it without the benefit of the actual article (which when
read closely, reveals the hoax).

Congress has taken some great forwards steps recently, particularly through
the availability of the Senate and House gophers (gopher.senate.gov,
gopher.house.gov) and it would be unfortunate if people weren't aware of them.
I share this with ACE in hopes that you can help quash any of these on-line
rumors if you see them.  Feel free to put people in touch with me if they'd
like to hear more about what's happening in the cyber-Capitol :-)

Thanks for any help.  I enjoy April Fools gags, but a lot of folks just aren't 
getting this one! 

Regards,

Chris

Subject: Risks to government

My records show this happened on 22 February 1994.
The risks we take using computers are one thing, but the risks government
officials take when talking about computers are extreme.  Here I am, at home
watching CSPAN.  The entire morning is devoted to the new regulations from the
Federal Communications Commission concerning cable television.  I find it
quite interesting.  Then the chairman of the FCC shows up in a news
conference.  He answers questions about the new rules and regulations.  The
chairman of the FCC then opines that information about and from the FCC will
appear on the "Information Superhighway".  He says to connect to ftp.fcc.gov
What follows is a near a quote as I remember his words: "G O V stands for
government.  F C C stands for [long pause] F C C.  I don't know what F T P
stands for."  Remember, this is the chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission speaking live on CSPAN.  === Being a curious person, I made the
connection to ftp.fcc.gov and as of that morning, no FCC files were available
for FTP.  However, one directory, bearing a name which may have been the
initials of a system operator at the FTP site had something in it.  One file,
a GIF picture of actress Erika Eleniak, wearing most of her clothing, was
available for FTP.  So I grabbed it.  As of today (28 March) that directory
does not appear on the system, but there are directories containing FCC stuff.

Subject: IRS persistence

Unlike [many others], I dutifully filed an IRS Form 942 for a nanny we
employed in the first quarter of 1992.  Unfortunately, my calculations were
too high by a dollar; I suspect human error.

The ever-vigilant IRS computer found my mistake and issued a $1.01 refund
check within a month, even adding that penny for interest.  Something about
having a $1.01 government check really tickled me, so I decided to just keep
it instead of cashing it.  Since the check expires after a year, I figured I
was doing my part to reduce the deficit.

This week, two years later, I get _another_ check for $1.01, with the same
notation ("F-942 REF 03/92") as the previous check. I'm not cashing this one
either; now I want to find out how badly they want to give me this money.

Subject: BT Billing computers innocent

The current issue of New Scientist (26 March 1994, p. 19) includes an article
following up from the one I quoted (RISKS-15.56, 17 February 1994: Telephone
charges fail to fit the bill) regarding the overcharging on some telephone
bills in multiples of \pounds 420.

  ``Human error, not computer failure, was to blame for British Telecom's
  recent overcharging of some subscribers.  BT says that each case of
  incorrect billing was caused by ``an extremely unlikely combination of two
  human errors''.  The findings exonerate the computers, but indicate that BT
  staff sometimes ignore odd discrepancies in bills.

  The first error arose when an engineer working on a new digital exchange
  broke house rules and used a procedure borrowed from old analogue exchanges.
  He sent a handwritten note to BT's billing department, asking it to log the
  meter reading as zero on its computer.  The computer's software registers
  the last four digits of the meter reading, and on being given a reading
  ending in a string of zeros it deduced that the meter reading must have
  risen past 9,999 to 10,000.  When the time came to prepare the bill, the
  computer then took the same logic a stage further and added together two
  spurious quantities: one from the last real reading up to 10,000, and one
  from zero to the new reading.  Each unit costs 4.2p, leading to an
  overcharge of \pounds 420.

  The second error came when BT's automatic verification system correctly
  highlighted these figures as inordinately high compared with past readings
  on the same line.  But BT's staff ignored the warning and dispatched the
  bill, complete with errors.''

New Scientist made no reference to their last sentence of the original
article: ``[Insiders] believe that BT has a bug in its accounting software and
that the problem is thus much more widespread than has so far been
recognised.''

>From the article as I understand it, it seems that the computer software has
difficulty in making the distinction between freshly reset meter readings, and
normal `clocked' meter readings.  This could be explained cleanly if it was
not possible (or unnecessary or difficult) to reset the meters of old analogue
exchanges.  The move to digital exchanges would therefore either need a change
in the software or a change in the procedures.  Ignoring my suppositions,
though, the system (including personnel and computers) is designed correctly
to cope with both analogue and digital exchanges.

Subject: Insurance claims ignore patients name

I just got off the phone with my prescription plan holder, trying to find out
why my son Jason's deductible had not been fulfilled.  I picked up a
prescription for him last week and had to pay the full $43.95 cost of the
medicine.  My plan has a $50 deductible per family member but I was sure that
he had had several other prescriptions since the beginning of the plan year.
I check my records and, sure enough, the prescriptions totaled more than $50.
After checking back with the pharmacy, it was determined that although the
Jason's name was on the prescription, the prescription had gone toward
fulfilling my other son Graham's deductible.  The pharmacist had entered the
wrong code (02 rather than 03).  However, I was also sure that Graham had had
several prescriptions filled, so his deductible should already have been
fulfilled.  Further checking showed that Graham's prescriptions had been
charged toward my deductible (my code is 00).

Talking to the prescription plan representative on the phone, I declared that
this was a stupid way to do things.  The system ignored the name that was
entered and keyed only on the family member's number.  I was assured that this
was the best way to reduce the RISK of a mistake (he used that word).  I guess
the person who set up the system must have had several siblings with the same
name.

Fortunately, my wife keeps all our medical records in good order so we were
able to find documentation and figure out what had happened.  The monitary
cost to us would have been small if we had not sorted it out, but I can easily
see this happening where the costs could be much higher.

Subject: The RISKs of Canadian Poodles using 911

   VANCOUVER (Reuter) - A pesky pet played havoc with Canadian police who
   responded to an emergency call only to find they were barking up the 
   wrong tree.  A team of officers burst into a Vancouver home after
   receiving a 911 emergency phone call but found nothing more threatening 
   than a poodle inside, police said Wednesday.  The dog had knocked the 
   phone off the hook and hit an automatic dial button that called police.
   Police feared the worst when all they heard on the line was the dog
   barking.  ``We came screeching over. It was a bit silly,'' confessed
   police spokesman Joe Arduini.

They had 911 on speed dial?  Come on - that's inexcusable, given how easy it
is to accidentally hit the wrong button on a phone.  Do that many people die
because they never finish dialing all three numbers?  "Poor guy.  Would have
made it, but he was only able to hit 9-1."

I suppose the moral of this story is that the RISK isn't necessarily in the
technology but rather in the people (mis)using it.

Subject:  Ottawa, Canada, Radio contest overloads phone system 

Friday, March 25th, the Ottawa radio station CHEZ-FM offered 53 pairs of Pink
Floyd concert tickets free to callers.  The offer was open from 6 pm.  The
station is on a specially equipped exchange, but an estimated 300,000+ call
attempts in an hour caused delayed dial tone and other problems from Cornwall,
Ontario to Pembroke, Ontario (about 100+ miles).  Ottawa is Canada's capital.

One story noted that some people (100 or so) called 911 to report telephone
trouble, instead of 611.  There were reports of actual outages, but it is not
clear that people were waiting for dial tone and not hanging up and trying
again.

Personal observation - I certainly had delayed dial tone, but only delayed 10
seconds or so.

One person I spoke to said that he had had seven phone lines active trying to
get the free tickets.

Very little is new here.  I leave the obvious pun for the moderator.

Subject: 911 as wrong number - they don't seem to care anymore

When 911 was first implemented (many years ago) here in Peoria IL, everyone
with a phone number of the form x91-1xxx was forced to change their numbers.

After a few years, though, the phone company started reassigning numbers of
this form.

Jeff Hibbard  jeff@bradley.bradley.edu

   [In various old small-town switching centers, one could dial just the
   last four digits, or in some cases five digits, for local calls.  That
   led to similar problems when 911 was introduced, and has now disappeared
   almost everywhere in the U.S.A. (although for other reasons as well.) PGN]

Subject: Re: Denver Baggage Handling (Wexelblat, RISKS-15.68)

1. I would think Frankfurt/Main airport (FRA) was the first to have an
integrated, computer-controlled baggage distribution system. For years I heard
they were the only international airport able to guarantee 45 minute
connections because of it.

2. When the system was installed (ca. '72), the contractor, AEG, required
something like six months past the deadline to get it running. In that time,
they reputably paid a penalty (or whatever you call "Konventionalstrafe" in
English) of DM 200K _per_day_. I don't think they made much profit on the
contract...

I cannot explain why the Highway Dept. chose to blow up the deceased whale.  I
can, however, explain why this problem fell to the Highway Dept.  Unlike most
states, which allow private ownership of beaches, Oregon has kept all its
beaches owned by the state.  The mechanism for this, curiously, is that the
beach is technically part of the of state highway system--although you
generally aren't allowed to drive on it.  So the whale shows up on a state
highway, and it's the Highway Dept.'s problem

From: Tom Standage <thomas@primrose.demon.co.uk>
Subject: Are there really pictures of banknotes inside photocopiers?

Following the resent posting about how photocopiers prevent banknote forgery,
I wonder how many other readers' jaws dropped open at the suggestion that
there is a ROM inside a colour photocopier (such as the Canon CLC350/550) with
images of common banknotes in it. This just wouldn't make sense, aside from
the fact that it would rapidly go out of date - it would simply be too
computationally expensive to compare every image placed on the copier with the
images in ROM. The Canon machines in question can also be used as colour laser
printers in conjunction with special interfaces, so presumably any
anti-forgery computer inside the copier would also have to check that
banknotes weren't being scanned into a personal computer and then printed out
via the colour copier. This is absurd.

We have a CLC300 at work, and when an engineer came to fix it one day, he said
that the problems we were having (with jammed paper) were a design fault that
had been fixed on the CLC350. I asked what other features the 350 had, and he
said it had anti-forgery features - and proceeded to tell me the same story
about a chip with pictures of banknotes in it. I found this so hard to believe
that I asked around, and eventually someone gave me a more believable
explanation. Apparently the security measures depend on special inks used when
the banknotes are printed. These inks change colour when illuminated by the
scanner in the copier, and produce copies of the banknote with an obvious
colour shift. I don't know whether the 350 and 550 have a different kind of
bulb in the scanner or are able detect the special inks, but I have also heard
of other documents that won't copy properly because the copier thinks they're
banknotes. Rumour has it you can get round this by photocopying through very
thin tracing paper - which presumably works with banknotes as well.

Anyhow, perhaps someone at Canon can give us a definitive answer. On the other
hand, I wouldn't be surprised if they wished the status quo to continue, where
we all believe that copiers have chips with pictures of banknotes in them.
What makes me laugh is the message on the front panel of the CLC300, which
warns you not to copy money or certain other documents: "you *may* be
committing a criminal offense for which you *may* be prosecuted." Pretty
strong language, huh?

Subject: "Funny Money" and Smart Copiers

Once upon a time, long long ago in a galaxy far far away, an automobile
manufacturer known to all of its employees as "Generous Mother" began using
computers to control such things as mixture and spark advance and a host
of other variables. The maps for these variables were carried in 1k x 8 PROMS.

Certain individuals who shall remain nameless acquired the maps of these
programs for certain "performance" cars and designed their own maps. 

Unfortunately, these new maps, though amazing in improving performance
and efficiency were not what the manufacturer had certified.

So the aspiring young engineers replaced the 1k x 8 PROM with a 2k x 8 EEPROM
and a switch concealed under the dashboard. The lower 1k contained the stock
settings and the upper 1k, settings of a more "interesting" variety. For
roadside tests the switch was turned "off" and for normal driving "on".

I suspect that copiers that rely on "firmware" to block copying of bills
might soon acquire such switches.
