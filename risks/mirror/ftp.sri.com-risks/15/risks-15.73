Subject: A320 software goes on "3rd Party" maintenance

While I was in Copenhagen earlier today, a Danish friend, who knows of my
interest in the A320, drew to my attention an item in today's issue of the
news magazine "Goddaj" (if I recall the spelling correctly - it means "Good
Morning"). A translation of the article follows (courtesy of my Danish
friend):-

   --------Translation of Article in "Goddaj", 1st April 1994 -------- 

                   Danish Firm Scores Notable "First"
                   ---------------------------------- 

Thor Avionics, one of Denmark's most advanced high-tech firms, has secured 
a contract which makes it the first software house in the world to provide 
"third party" maintenance on a major safety-critical software system. 

In order to reduce the maintenance costs on its fleet of Airbus A320 aircraft 
(the first type of civil airliner in the world to have a computer-controlled 
"fly-by-wire" system), Air France has placed Thor under contract to provide 
all future maintenance on the software of this highly-automated aircraft. 

Wolf Larssen, director of Thor, said "This is the first contract of its type, 
and it won't be the last. Users of commercial software long ago discovered 
that there are great savings to be made by getting a "third party" firm to 
maintain their software. I am only surprised that it has taken users of 
safety-critical systems so long to discover the advantages. I expect other 
A320 operators to be placing similar contracts before too long." 

A "third-party" in this context means a firm which is independent of both the 
user and the supplier. Such firms, being "lean and mean" are usually capable 
of providing a much better and more cost-effective service than the original 
supplier, since they have fewer overheads and are less stifled by bureaucracy. 
In the commercial world, such contracts have usually gone to small, dynamic, 
organisations, and it seems that the world of safety-critical software will 
follow suite. 

"We had to beat some stiff opposition from Sextant Avionique, Matra, Logica, 
and similar large firms." said Mr. Larssen. "The fact that the software on the 
A320 will need to be maintained indefinitely means guaranteed jobs for highly 
qualified Danish workers for a long time to come." 

M. Theophile Gautier, spokesman for Air France, said "We have the utmost 
confidence in Thor to deliver the goods, both in terms of reduced cost, 
improved system performance, and increased safety." 

The automated systems on the A320, particularly the flight control and flight 
management systems, have sometimes been called into question following the 
various accidents involving this type of aircraft, although the accidents 
have generally been ascribed to pilot error. Even so, there is an obvious 
question mark over the ability of a third-party firm to maintain the level 
of safety. 

When asked about this, Mr. Larssen said "Our software maintenance and 
validation process is second to none. Although Airbus Industrie have refused 
to release the source code, so that we will have to strip out the binary and 
work from that, we anticipate no problems. Most of the modifications we will 
be making are fairly slight, so that regression testing can easily be done 
on a software flight simulator running on an Apple MacKintosh." 

A spokesman for the JAA (Joint Aviation Authority, which is responsible for 
certifying that any new or modified design of aircraft is airworthy) said 
"The basic design has already been certified. All that Thor will be doing 
are minor post-certification modifications. Thor themselves have been 
certified as conforming to the ISO-9000 quality standard and to SEI level 2, 
so it should not be difficult for them to meet the requirements for our own 
certification, which is based upon an industry standard referred to as 
RTCA-DO/178B." 

In response to questions about what the maintenance would actually involve, 
Mr. Larssen said "Occasionally, Airworthiness Directives are issued by the 
JAA which require changes to be made to the design of an aircraft in order 
to correct a fault. Where this change involved modifying the software, Thor 
will be responsible for doing this. The beauty of software is that the 
modified version can be installed on all existing aircraft in seconds, simply 
by inserting a new eprom. In addition to this corrective maintenance, we will 
also be offering Air France enhancements to improve the performance of the 
A320. The practice of "chipping", or modifying the firmware in the engine 
management system of an automobile such as a BMW in order to make it go 
faster, is well established. I don't expect that we could make your A320 
perform like an F-111, but we could certainly extend the "safe flight 
envelope" beyond the rather conservative limits originally set by the 
manufacturer."

   [This is quite a Thor-ny piece.  Incidentally, I note that "goddaj" is
   really "good day" (albeit used in the morning, as in the case of Guten
   Tag), and April 1 is certainly a "goddaj".  Unfortunately, occasional
   adjacent-key typing errors might easily replace the "j" with an "m", which
   might be an appropriate reaction.  PGN]

Subject: Re: Risks of spelling checkers

The main risk is in relying too heavily on spell-checkers.  As people produce
more of their own documents, they no longer have someone who does most of the
proof-reading, and rely on a program instead.

Automation of other parts of document production has caused a change in the
type of errors that can get through.  Up until a few years ago, most errors in
trade books were switched letters ("b" for "d") probably caused by manual
typesetting.  Now one finds many more mistakes of a wrong word, no doubt from
a spell-checker substitution.  Perhaps we can ask, who checks the
spell-checkers?

Subject: Re: Risks of spelling checkers

By definition, a spell checker is a product which eliminates a large set of
errors in a text. It does not eliminate them all.  I would suggest that you do
not go onto "auto pilot" when using the spell checker.  Instead use the same
level of awareness that you do when your write.  In fact it makes sense to
examine the text around every place the spell checker stops.  There are a lot
of errors which can only be eliminated by human attention.  As far as I can
see your general problem would not be eliminated by getting rid of profanity.
Suppose you had a "Ms. Gorse" in your document.  A spell checker might offer
"Goose".  Your client (or boss) might be equally offended.

Subject: Re: Mud Slide Cuts East Coast Phones (Re: RISKS-15.72)

Note this took out a reported 200+ DS3 circuits. That's ~~100,000+
voice-grade circuits (if all were such). 

Netcom's DC POP was one of the DS1's. They had leased the circuit from WilTel,
but WilTel in turn had subcontracted the facilities from MCI.  Further, while
MCI had the cable back up by 11pm, somehow WilTel did not communicate this to
Netcom. Thus the POP was not restored until the next morning. (Irony here -
WilTel got started pulling fiber through abandoned oil pipelines. Schedule 300
pipe provides much better than average protection against backhoe fade.)

Classic RISKs:
1) Too many eggs in one basket. While MCI surely has reserve capacity,
it does not seem to have 200 DS3's worth. No self-healing ring, it
seems.

2) Lost-in-translation syndrome - Once more than two organizations are
involved, the chances of getting any intact message from one end to the
other goes down as an exponential function of the number of hops.

ps: Ispell wants to turn "WilTel" into "Wilted"........

Subject: Aural Sex and Rudder Actuators (RISKS-15.72)

It is interesting that both of these incidents have a common thread - 
no feedback loops.

Way back in the '70s when I was part of the team that designed the full
authority digital flight control system for the AFTI F-16, we had a similar
problem: the system was so complex and so many people were involved that it
was easy to miss the change that Jon made today would affect Harold's system -
and this was during the design stage. In production, component substitution
could have the same effect, some so subtle that it would not be noticed until
a pilot found himself in an interesting situation.

One of my tasks was to develop the simulation software used in a 40 foot
Evans & Sutherland dome & as such with each revision of the flight control
software, the appropriate changes had to be fed into the dome system.

In order to maintain continuity we developed a "configuration control model"
that simply scanned the source code for all uses of a variable or subroutine
and provided a map of the points of contact for each variable.  When a change
occurred, it was a simple matter to report the change to each affected
engineer/programmer. It was also an excellent tool for reporting when someone
had accidentally used the wrong variable in an equation since it would
suddenly show use in a routine it had not been used in before.

This tool also made it possible to notify those responsible for affected
modules when a component change was made since the tree for the variables
used with the component was readily available.

The process was really simple but deductive rather than inductive: changes
were detected not by people submitting a change notice but by a comparison
of "current" versus "last", active configuration management rather than
passive. Several times changes were found before the paperwork arrived.

The simple fact is that any large system, from a telephone number list to
aircraft fight controls is subject to Chaos math: small omissions over time
will increase in effect. Murphy says that unknown effects will be destructive.
Multiple omissions multiply effects.

The most effective answer I have found is active feedback loops, something 
computers are very good at. Today one way I protect sites from intruder 
attacks is by requiring modem registration and briefing of owners. I also 
conduct random sweeps of the telephone lines looking for unregistered modems. 
Without the second, the first would rapidly become obsolete. This has two
advantages:
1) I find omissions quickly.
2) People are less likely to make omissions knowing that they will be noticed.

Over the last few years I have seem many instances in RISKS of problems with 
aircraft flight controls making the wrong decision or telling the pilot
the wrong thing and each time have wondered if active design or configuration 
management feedback loops could have prevented them.

Subject: More jail-door openings

I saw on San Francisco's channel 4 last night that a jail in Marin which
houses such people as Polly Klaus' killer has been having problems with
their cell doors.  Apparently, without reason, they would just open.
The prison said their was no danger in escape.  They blamed the problem
on "software errors".

How about that?

Subject: find/xargs strangeness

Man, just when I thought I understood this stuff.  I have condensed
this down to the following:

euclid% euclid% mkdir something_scwewy
euclid% cd !$
euclid% foreach i (a b c d)
? echo $i > $i 
? end
euclid% find . -type f -print | xargs -n1 more
./b
./c
./d
--More--(Next file: ./a)          # Hit <SPACE>
./a
::::::::::::::
a
euclid% 

Now, to my way of thinking, it should be executing the commands "more ./a;
more ./b; more ./c; more ./d".  Certainly I have had and come to expect this
sort of behavior from xargs in the past.  It seems to be a problem with
"more", because I get decent behavior with, say, "echo" and "cat":

euclid% find . -type f -print | xargs -n1 cat
a
b
c
d

Yet:
euclid% find . -type f -print | xargs -t -n1 more
more ./a 
./b
./c
./d

BTW, if there are more than a screenful of files, I get prompted by
more to scroll through the list of them before it actually runs
more on the first file.  I don't get this at all.  This is on SunOS 4.1.3.

Subject: Re: Peter J. Scott: find/xargs strangeness]

This is an example of a strange interaction of two bugs, one in `more' and one
in `xargs'.  All bugs are RISKS to some extent, its not clear how severe or
unusual they need to be to make it into RISKS...

There are two strange things occurring here.
1. When `more' is invoked with its standard input connected to something
   OTHER than a terminal, it treats `stdin' as the first file to display.
2. `xargs' doesn't close the input to the child it invokes.

So what happens is, `xargs' invokes `more ./a', and `more' reads everything
it can from its standard input, which connects to the `find'.  When
`more' finishes, `xargs' finds that its `stdin' is empty and exits.

To exercise these bugs separately, try:
echo a b c | more ./a
echo a b c d | xargs -n1 cat -

Subject: P. R. China Computer Security Rules (long)

connection to the Internet (CHINANET; sub CHINANET to
LISTSERV@TAMVM1.TAMU.EDU).

The Chinese have named their new project to connect China to the Internet the
"Golden Bridge" project.  The following document purports to be the newly
developed "PRC Regulations on Safeguarding Computer Information Systems."  It
seems quite appropriate for RISKS.

As you read this, keep in mind that 1) in China accused persons are guilty
until proven innocent; 2) laws referred to in the document as ones applying in
certain circumstances are often harsh, subject to change without notice, and
so vaguely worded as to make easy the prosecutor's job, not of proving guilt
(not necessary), but of arguing why the penalty should be maximized; 3) the
"Public Security" laws referred to are the same laws that stipulate that the
families of serious offenders will be billed for the single bullet used in
judgement; 4) certain concepts (virus, special security products) are either
poorly defined or all inclusive; 5) in China when there is doubt as to the
legality of any particular act, illegality is assumed (this is important not
only in court, but also in normal life, where people tend to be more
conservative in part because of it.)

As we welcome this brave new domain into our net.universe, it will be
interesting, and perhaps surprising at times, to see how another set of
explorers on the electronic frontier are approaching the flow of information.
Golden Bridge, indeed.  As read, sending email without filing a customs
declaration, or accepting a shareware registration for an anti- virus product
could both be construed as being illegal.  There's a lot of room for
improvement here, imho.
