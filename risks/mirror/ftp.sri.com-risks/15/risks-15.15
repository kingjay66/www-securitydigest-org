Subject: Confirmed reservation ... for non-existent flight

One Sunday in August this year I was booked on a scheduled flight from Buffalo
to Ithaca. The ticket was issued in the UK and the reservation was confirmed.

It was a little surprising therefore to be told at Buffalo airport that I had
been booked on a non-existent flight: there just is no such flight on a Sunday
and the printed timetable confirms this.

How was I issued with such a ticket? The airline informs me that "it is rare
for a problem of this nature to occur". Apparently, "when your agency made
reservations for the two flights in question, our system accepted the
reservation as confirmed even though the flights did not operate". They are
"unable to determine where an error may have occurred" but "it is generally
thought to be due to a software or message switching malfunction".

That it is "rare" does not really help much. Must I (and everyone else
travelling by the airline) now check *every* ticket to ensure both that the
reservation status is OK and that there is actually such a flight? Or just
some tickets? Which ones?

(For information, this is a large international airline, not a small
operator.)

Subject: Re: Corrigenda: RISKs of trusting e-mail (Lee, RISKS-15.13)

The *real* problem is the perceptions casual users of computers and
computer networks have.  A few, but not all, are:

	- If you are reading it on a computer, it must be true
	(similar to people believing photos, television, newspapers, etc.

	- Electronic mail is private and untamperable

	- Falsification of e-mail indicates that the security of the
	system, network, or user account has been compromised.

We know that it is easier to falsify e-mail than p-mail, but not *much*
easier.  It is very easy in every organization I have been associated with
(high school, 2 universities, a no such agency in the government, a large
computer firm, and now, TIS) to get official stationery.  Now, with PostScript
and PCs, it is trvial to create your own stationery.

The wet signature on p-mail sets it apart from most (sans digital signatures
with or without certificates) e-mail.  But, this is significant, in this
instance, only if the recipient recognizes the wet signature.

What organizations need to do is set policy on such rude behaviour.  E.g., a
statement indicating that misrepresenting yourself as, or impersonating,
someone else -- whether in e-mail, p-mail, or on the telephone -- is against
the rules and will result in certain sanctions.  Faking p-mail is less common
because there are a bunch of steps to go through along the way, allowing
multiple decision points for the person's conscience to kick in (getting
paper, typing, putting in envelope, sealing, addressing, stamping, taking to
mail drop, and mailing).  E-mail is typed up and gone in less than a minute.
Most e-mail systems treat that like p-mail dropped into a postal box: from
that point on it is the "property" of the recipient.

Subject: Re: Porn, Wiretapping, DES, HERF (RISKS-15.14)

Several items in this digest struck my interest.

First was John Gray's comments on "porn" accidentally making it onto a
CATV "children's channel".

>Have you ever wondered how much trust you place on what you see on television?
>Not only that broadcasters will show "appropriate" programs but that the

Very little. And I do not expect this to change. I really do wish the
population at large would discover the "end to end principle" for
itself. They should stop demanding that the CATV companies, satellite
uplinkers, broadcasters, video store owners, the government, i.e.,
anyone and everyone but themselves, be responsible for controlling
what they and their children watch.

all those easily offended households: it's call an "off switch".

Bingo! This was one of the things that convinced me that the
widespread use of strong cryptography to defeat wiretapping will on
balance be a Good Thing.  But to be honest, when this happens (and it
will, whether the government likes it or not) it will admittedly
become more difficult, though not impossible, to prosecute a few
crimes that actually ought to *be* crimes. Foremost among them is
influence peddling and bribery among government officials.

I had resigned myself to this as an unfortunate consequence of an
otherwise positive development. But then it occurred to me: the only
reason crimes like influence peddling and bribery are possible is
because the public has granted government officials so much trust and
power in the first place! Who knows? Perhaps one of the consequences
of universal cryptography will be a lessening of the power of
centralized government and the delegation of much less personal
authority to those within it.

Re Kevin Burfitt's note on a new Australian cipher to replace DES,
does anyone know if the algorithm will be publicly available?

|> Isn't part of the security with DES its slowness, which implies that this

Not necessarily. DES was originally designed for hardware
implementation, and many of its operations are inherently slow in
software. A good example are the initial and final permutations, which
consist simply of renumbering the input and output bits. This is
trivial in hardware but a real pain in software. Some even suspect
that these permutations were added solely to sabotage efficient
software implementation, as they contribute nothing to the strength of
the algorithm. Certainly not to a brute-force keysearch attack, which
can be conducted after the permutations have been "factored out".

A new encryption algorithm designed specifically for efficient
software implementation could run much faster than software DES
without necessarily being less secure. It would use the native
operations and native data sizes found on most modern computers.
Examples include IDEA and MD5 (although MD5 is not, strictly speaking,
a cipher, it does have a cipher-like structure).

|> Subject: The FAA and HERF

Winn Schwartau's article on "The FAA and HERF" is exactly the kind of article
we've been seeing far too many of in the media lately. Not because the subject
isn't worth investigating, but because the article is long on scary anecdotes,
impressive sounding jargon and calls for action, and short on cold,
quantitative information and logical reasoning.

The term "High Energy RF" is something I'd associate with broadcast
transmitters, long range radars and microwave ovens, not your average laptop
computer. Exactly what constitutes "high energy"?  A few orders of magnitude
would be good enough.

And there are quite a few radionavigation systems in use by commercial
aviation, each with its own uses, strengths and weaknesses, including
vulnerability to interference. Which ones are we talking about?  Over land,
VOR and DME are the most common. And they work by two very different
principles on widely separated radio frequencies. DME is inherently much more
resistant to interference than VOR.  ILS (instrument landing system), is a
cousin to VOR.  It probably has about the same susceptibility to interference,
but in a situation with a much smaller margin for error -- which is why many
airlines now ban electronics during landing, even though it may not be
strictly necessary.  And over the oceans you have Omega, operating at VLF
frequencies, usually combined with an Inertial Navigation System (INS). (GPS
is not yet permitted as a primary navigation reference, and LORAN-C is common
in US private planes and helicopters but rare in commercial aircraft.)

So exactly which system was in use by the 747-400 in question? Chances are it
was an INS, found on almost all commercial transoceanic aircraft. And INS's
main feature is that it lacks a radio receiver, making it virtually immune to
radio interference! This makes the anecdote just a *little* less credible.

Again, I'm not trying to belittle those concerned about interference to
aviation navigation. I myself fly frequently with a laptop. If there really
were a hazard, believe me, I'd want to know about it. But what we need are
some carefully controlled tests producing reliable, quantitative information.
The closest I've seen to this appears in the October 1993 issue of PC
Computing magazine. They actually measured the RF emissions from a variety of
personal electronic devices, including cellular phones, AM/FM broadcast
radios, walkmans, laptop computers, CD players and handheld games. Their
conclusion:

"...it was highly unlikely for laptops and most PEDs [portable electronic
devices] to cause navigational interference. Of the devices tested, nearly
half produced signals so weak they couldn't be measured above the baseline
noise present on all radio frequencies... In general, we were unable to
produce any real VOR interference except when we used FM receivers and
cellular phones, and when we placed other devices unrealistically close --
within 6 to 12 inches of the VOR receiver antenna."

A recent issue of PC Magazine conducted a series of tests using an HERF 
detector to determine the amount of leakage generated by portable computing 
equipment. They found that common equipment did NOT generate HERF 
interference above the background noise level. In other words, apart from 
widespread anecdotes, there is yet no evidence to back up claims that 
portable computers are responsible for interfering with in-flight equipment. 
I accept that the author's experience with corrupt FCC certification labs 
means that some very badly made portables could be exceptions.

However, PC Magazine did find that most common non-computing devices, such 
as Discmans or Walkmans, DID cause measurable levels of HERF interference. 
It is conceivable that if such a device is used close to a control board, 
interference will occur.

[Incident involving possible HERF interference due to a laptop.]
>Investigating the incident, Boeing engineers bought the same model

This demonstrates the point of the first paragraph. All that is available 
are anecdotes, which show only a weak cause/effect link, and which in many 
cases aren't reproducible.

While the possibility of HERF interference does suggest the possbility of 
new devices for carrying out terrorist acts, consider the following:

1. Most airlines require you to declare whether you have any electrical 
items in your baggage, and will ask you to remove the batteries (e.g. 
British Airways, Cathay Pacific)

2. Some airlines will not carry unaccompanied baggage (El Al is a pretty 
good example).

3. Some airports require you to turn on electrical devices at the security 
check to demonstrate that they work normally. At the levels of radiation 
output suggested, the X-ray/metal detector equipment would probably 
malfunction, which ought to make the security personnel suspicious. 

The ability to circumvent these procedures and successfully smuggle a 'HERF 
bomb' onto a plane does NOT make HERF interference any more RISKy than 
other devices which could destroy a plane. Instead, it points to poor 
execution of security procedures. If an airport's security is really bad, 
then one could probably smuggle a real bomb on board.

As for a HERF gun aimed at planes taking off - why is this a serious risk 
beyond that posed by more conventional weapons? A guy standing off the end 
of the runway with a rifle could probably put enough holes in the fuel tank 
to cause trouble, and it's easier than building a HERF gun.

>Cyberspace has indeed come of age, and modern airplanes are as much a part 
>of it as computer networks.

>It's just that the FAA doesn't know what to do about it yet.

>Let's hope they get up to speed quickly.  Very quickly.

Current research (of which there is admittedly little) indicates that 
portable computers are extremely unlikely to be the cause of HERF 
interference; the FAA would be wise to do a study on the effects of 
electrical devices on in-flight control systems. The security threat posed 
by malicious HERF bombs or guns seems no more (or no less) serious than the 
threat posed by conventional terrorist devices, and certainly does not 
justify the shock-horror writing style of the original article. There are as 
many RISKS in creating unnecessary panic as there are in overlooking 
hazards.

Subject: HERF Danger to JQ Public

HERF is *high energy*. It doesn't come from laptops, CD players, or FM radios.

My understanding is that HERF comes from the government's testing of directed
energy weapons. The characteristics of the directed energy are classified.

Design and test for electromagnetic compatibility is not easy; especially when
the electromagnetic environment is not defined. And that is the root of the
HERF risk.

BTW: I don't deny that there are risks associated with radio frequency
interference from laptops, mobile transmitters, and other electronic devices.
I just don't want HERF to be put in the same risk category.

Using the same technology, it is possible to create digital pseudonyms that
can both assure a retailer of the purchaser's credentials while protecting his
or her (or it's) identity.  It is even possible to create "digital cash" that
can be anonymously handed from person to person, copied ad infinitum, yet
spent only once.

A simple example: you register several pseudonyms with a credentials agency;
the retailer can present your pseudo to the agency and be told "it's ok, he's
on the up and up."  Yet you can give each retailer different pseudos if you so
desire.

Of course, this requires you to trust the credentials agency; there are other
protocols that eliminate this need, but they are more complicated.

Burfitt describes a new Australian encryption algorithm, notes that
it runs at 20 Mbps, and asks:

	 Isn't part of the security with DES its slowness, which
	 implies that this new encryption method will be inherently
	 risky because of its speed ?

No, DES was never designed to be slow, though there are some aspects of
its design which are inherently quite slow if done in software.  You
may be thinking of the UNIX system password hashing algorithm, which is
based on DES, and which was indeed intended to be slow.

Not that 20 Mbps is particularly fast today.  Eberle and Thacker have
described a 1 Gbps DES chip (Proceedings of the IEEE 1992 Custom Integrated
Circuits Conference), and 40 Mbps chips are readily available.

There is some slight risk in an encryptor being able to run too quickly, in
that it makes exhaustive search somewhat more feasible.  But key size is a
much more important variable.  DES's 56 bits are too few; see Wiener's design
(CRYPTO '93) for a US$1 million DES-cracking machine, or for that matter the
Diffie-Hellman critique of DES in 1977 on just those grounds.

In evaluating this new algorithm, I'd look at the key size, whether or not the
algorithm is open to public scrutiny, and whether or not the Australian
government is fond of things like key escrow.

There was a good discussion of the Multics ring structure in the new (this
year) ALT.OS.MULTICS discussion (we don't give up easily!). What was
interesting was that the revisionist view is that rings were not all that
useful. Rings were useful internally to provide a supervisor and
supersupervisor (kernel) mode and a user mode, though they were overkill for
that purpose. Nontrivial attempts to use rings ran up against the mutually
suspicious subsystem problem. Similarly the hardware pointer validation was
insufficient for real applications.

Basically, protecting the operating system is a minor problem as systems 
become more complex and the focus shifts from operating system as master of 
the universe to the operating system as a nice utility that helps keep the 
local system intact but the real action is in the interactions between 
subsystems and physically separate systems.

year old technology from the mainstream of OS development indicates a strange
risk: if it was developed in academia so that you can't patent it most of
industry will go for a patentable alternative even if that's patently
inferior.  Tom Thomson tom@fiveg.icl.com P.S. for anyone interested, the
manufacturer, mainframe series, and OS referred to above are ICL, Series 39,
and VME respectively; 16 ring hardware protection fully exploited by the
software, with an OS that's been around for 20 years.
