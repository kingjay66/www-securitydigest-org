Subject: FireFly in the ointment? 

Don Watts of Tustin CA checked in by SnailMail with a note that the StarWars
decoy/laser-radar program (FireFly) worked completely backwards (for example,
with respect to incoming maneuvers) because the accelerometer was wired in
opposition to the directional assumption in the software.  (The shaker tests
of the decoy were omitted in an effort to save money.)

Don Watts also offered the following memo from Steven Ray of the Ball Efratom
Division, dated 20 Jan 1994, and lightly edited by PGN.

  Aging Analysis Software malfunction

  On Monday, 17 January 1994, a `bug' developed in the IBM-based ``Ball
  Aging Analysis'' software program.  This bug prevents us from plotting
  any aging data after 16 Jan 1994 even though the data actually exists
  in the database.  This bug effectively shut down all shipments of units
  because no graphs could be generated.  After some initial investigation,
  this bug was linked to the modified Julian date of 2148 and that any 
  date before that was OK, but any data after that would not plot.  So,
  as a temporary fix while the software code is being corrected and to
  continue to be able to ship units, I have set the dates on all of the
  Aging computers back one year, to 1993, so that the aging data can be
  plotted on all Aging plots until a permanent fix can be done.

Subject: Clinical diagnosticians and diagnostic clinicians

Which of the following is *not* a reason for the clinician to remain an
essential part of the diagnostic process?

A Computers are unable to collect and evaluate nonverbal data.
B Patients have poor acceptance of computer-assisted assessment.
C Computers are poor at temporal reasoning.
D Computers cannot assess the clinical significance of a behavior.

The answer was given as B, though of course AI researchers are working on the
others....

Anyway, the _Psychiatric Annals_ Jan 1994 Vol 24, No 1 issue is about "Using
Computers in Psychiatry".  Shrinks can get continuing education credit for
reading this mag and mailing in a quiz included.

Titles of articles range from using computers to teach ugrads (including
showing video clips of psychopaths from popular hollywood productions..)  to
expert systems making drug recommendations, to computational models of the
mind and Psychiatry.  Most articles are written by MDs with a few real
doctorates.

Subject: UK bank preparing for electronic money trial

I was hoping that someone else might have seen more about this and posted 
information here, but it appears not; in that case I'll mention what I know,
in the hope that someone will be able to fill in the details.

One of the big UK banks is apparently planning to introduce a trial in
Swindon, UK of an electronic money system, where money is held on plastic
cards (I'm not sure whether magnetic or smart). Money is transferred through
the system using either a handheld reader or an EFTPOS system in a shop. The
cards are not personal, but can be locked with a 4-digit PIN code. A card that
isn't locked can be used by anyone, while a locked card requires the code in
order to view the balance or deduct money from the card. The nature of the
system allows individuals to transfer money from card to card using the
appropriate palmtop-sized system.

I assume that the money is "cryptographic", but I've forgotten the details (I 
read all this in a paper some months agp). Does anyone know any more about this
system? It raises a whole host of issues, both social and technical.

Subject: What goes around, comes around

The following was posted on a local BBS about the recent incident on the 
network.

ANDREWS NEWS
 
Staff member suspended for network abuse, by Wendy Wein
 
     Clarence Thomas, systems administrator for "Redwood," the administrative
computer, will be temporarily suspended from his job because he sent a 5,500
character religious message to between 1,200 to 1,500 news groups across the
world through the Internet.  This act violated the system's purpose, giving
Andrews University a bad reputation among the Internet users. Over 1,200
complaints came over the Internet to the Andrews computer science department
demanding justice.
     According to Mailen Kootsey, chair of the academic computing committee
and dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, Thomas will be suspended from
his position for a week. His status will be reviewed at the end of the time
period. During this week Thomas will not have available access to the network
computers.
     Sometime between five and eight o'clock Monday evening, January 17,
Thomas sent his three-page message titled "Global Alert for All: Jesus is
Coming Soon," from the Andrews computing center to the news groups which are
accessible through the Internet, a computer system which connects computers
throughout the world.
     These news groups deal with different individual topics. For example, if
a news group is about cars, then only information about cars should be sent to
that news group. Some people subscribe to more than one group and some
universities and organizations are subscribed to almost all of them. Thomas
sent his religious message to all of these groups.
     People who were not interested received this message, some more than
once. Some organizations received 1,200 to 1,500 copies.  For many of the
subscribers religious input was not accepted very well. This message took up
their time and money.  The message accumulated 5.5 kilobytes of disk space.
Within an hour after the message was sent, Daniel Bidwell, administrative
contact for the network at Andrews, received Internet messages from the East
coast.
     In two hours they came from the West coast and within four hours,
complaint letters came in from other countries. The letters made statements
such as "This is not what I am paying for" and "Will this guy be stopped?"
     In addition to the news groups, Thomas also sent his message through a
mailing list, filling others' electronic mail. This could have been changed by
sending it to only a few news groups so fewer copies could have been
distributed.  "If he sent his message through a news group which dealt with
religious issues then everything would be fine," said Bidwell, "No one would
have known."
     There are no laws against Thomas' actions, yet he violated and broke some
of the unwritten rules of society. That is why many people are unhappy.
     This act created poor reactions towards the university.  Thomas' intent
was to spread the good news of Jesus' return to all those he could reach.
Thomas was trying to witness to others, yet instead of creating joy in
peoples' heart, he only created anger and resentment. "He was doing the right
thing in the wrong way," said Bidwell.
     Some of those who wrote to complain said that they agreed with the
message, but that Thomas delivered it wrongly. This message has created bad
public relations for the church at another's expense.
     The letters that were received included threats. They wanted Thomas
fired, or else the Internet connections from the Andrews campus could be
"taken." People are now writing and finding ways to contact President Lesher.
Not only have strangers called, but also a large amount of Adventists claiming
that something must be done to save the church's sacred reputation.
     On Monday morning, January 24, Rob Barnhurst, Thomas's supervisor and
director of the computing center, Ed Wines, vice president for finance, and
Kootsey, met to discuss the incident.  They decided to send out an apology
through the Internet, explaining that they did not condone Thomas's act and
will try to keep this from happening again.
     Thomas graduated from Andrews with a computer science degree.  Those at
the computer science department feel that he knew better then to send out that
many copies. "It was clearly, very definitely abuse," said Ray Paden, chair of
the computer science department.  "He broke the guidelines for the Internet
and violated the net etiquette. The trust was violated."

CompuServe:

Glitch Reveals The Power Of Internet; New Group's Offer Unleashes Users' Tirade
By John Burgess and John Schwartz, Washington Post Staff Writers, 31 Jan 1994
  
  A small organization promising free access to a global computer network
  found itself recently the focus of a deluge of electronic hate mail. To its
  chagrin, the messages were carried all over the world by the very network
  the group promotes, the Internet.

The authors explain that the International Internet Association (IIA) issued
ads last year offering free access to the Internet.  However, to get access,
eager users had to submit a credit card number.  Then, potential customers
were told, the free-access ports were generally busy.  If they wished, such
customers could subscribe to the service at $0.20/minute, charged to the
credit card.

Scott Ward, an official with CapAccess of Washington, DC, another service
providing free Internet access, investigated IIA and couldn't locate any
evidence of its computer.  He then sent out an electronic warning that was
widely circulated. He wrote, "I am not convinced this organization exists and
highly discourage any Internet user from sending information until you make
certain that the IIA is real."

Unfortunately for everyone involved, the IIA was real.  The Executive Director
of the IIA, Max Robbins, promised to repair the damage to its credibility
caused by the incorrect electronic rumour.  He announced changes in the
organization's financing: all access would be free, but the IIA would solicit
corporate donations.


This story once again illustrates the need for the same (or greater) level
of care in verifying what we post on the Internet.  Because information in
electronic form doesn't fade, get wrinkled, or impossible to read after
multiple use, electronic rumours can circulate forever.  RISKS readers will
recall the case of Craig Shergold's unstoppable avalanche of post cards.

Medicare Billing to Join Electronic Superhighway; One National System to
Handle All Payments, By Spencer Rich, Washington Post, 20 Jan 1994

    By the end of the decade, one giant nationwide computer system will
  electronically pay nearly all of the 1 billion bills Medicare handles each
  year. Beneficiaries will only have to hand their Medicare cards to their
  doctors, hospitals, laboratories or nursing homes to make sure their bills
  get paid.
    Once a patient's identification number is punched into a terminal at a
  hospital or doctor's office, the computer will compute how much Medicare
  owes, electronically transfer that amount to the doctor's or hospital's bank
  account, calculate how much an individual's Medigap (supplemental insurance)
  policy owes and automatically bill for that. If the Medicare beneficiary has
  no Medigap policy, the government computer will bill the patient for
  whatever is owed."

The article continues with the following key points:

o    $19 million six-year contract to GTE Government Systems Corp. of
     Chantilly, Va., for design and implementation;
o    implementation '96-'98;
o    Medicare Transaction System (MTS) will eliminate many manual procedures;
o    may save $200 million a year.

    Then, it's the speech-as-written and not the                  
    speech-as-delivered.

    That's a knee-jerk reaction and totally inaccurate. The       
    speeches-as-written are usually delivered a few hours in      
    advance of the speech, with an embargo on publication until the 
    speech has been delivered (the same embargo the rest of the   
    news media observes, by the way). If you look in the White    
    House Papers gopher hole (accessible for anonymous ftp by     
    telnetting to vector.casti.com), which mirrors the gopher     
    SUNsite at Syracuse University), there are several examples of 
    speeches-as-written (indicated by "as prepared") being followed 
    by clearly indicated "CORRECTED--as delivered" speeches.

    These are no longer contained in directories which are mirrored 
    by whitehouse.gov, as they are not White House documents. Talk 
    to Mr. Perot and get the address of *his* ftp site (I doubt if 
    he has one).
 
In the future, make sure you get the FACTS before you spout off
about stuff you--apparently--know nothing about. I know that doing
a bit of investigative research would greatly hobble your
arguments, but it would be the courteous thing to do.
 
If you have questions about what is or isn't contained in the

    In RISKS-15.47, mech@eff.org (Stanton McCandlish) asks us to "*Please take

your support of H.R. 3627, her bill to liberalize export controls on

    It's unclear if Rep. Cantwell

For more information and detail on one aspect of this see the December 1993
issue of IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology.  This magazine is probably
of interest to many Risks readers, since the subject is an intersection of a
significant risk area with a significant computer content.

The discussion of ethics in the December issue is probably the most important.
It should act as a strong reminder that the risk of computer malfunction is
merely one aspect of system ethical analysis.  Just as most people now
understand that risk analysis must include the whole operational environment,
not just the literal instructions, we will eventually learn to consider risks
in the larger ethical context.  The initial step is to begin to understand the
ethical issues.

> ... the FORTRAN library disk i-o routine did retry for read failure, 

This reminds me of something I had meant to send in long ago, but which
may still be relevant.  The NEC CDR-72 CD-ROM seems to have used a similar,
highly successful error recovery technique.  I don't remember the exact
details, but the drive would substitute either the previous or the next
block for the one it had meant to retry.  There was absolutely no indication
of error to the host machine, just _silent_ data corruption.  Given what we
expect from CD-ROMs, the risks of this kind of failure mode are obvious.
(Oh, and note that this problem showed up with the first soft errors after
but a few months of dust accumulation.)

I think NEC's treatment of the problem shows a worse risk, though.  They
knew the flaw existed and they took no action to contact registered owners
(let alone unregistered ones).  Moreover, their first-level technical support
was either uninformed or else was instructed to avoid the issue.  When I
explained the problem to them in great detail, they kept insisting that I
send them the specific CD that was showing the problem and/or try a different
CD in the drive.  They could not (or would not) grasp the concept that an
unreported error was unacceptable in this context.  And they felt that if
any CD could be found to read without corruption at least once then the
drive must be fine.  I asked that they have somebody with a more technical
background get back to me, and indeed somebody did get back to me.

The technical person was so technical, of course, that he would not listen
to my detailed description of which blocks ended up where.  Instead he
required me to bring the phone to the computer to perform a ``special test.''
The test turned out to be to copy a file from the CD to the hard disk and
then run the ``special'' DOS program COMP on the two copies.  I was to
report the number of mismatches shown.  The number of mismatches was
the maximum that COMP will display before giving up, and reciting that
number won me a replacement drive for what he admitted was a known
problem.  I hate to think what would have happened if the drive failed
the same way during the COMP as during the copy.  Or worse, if I didn't
have a DOS machine on which to run the ``special test'' to his satisfaction.

I'm no expert on the uses of CD-ROMs, but I'll bet someone can come up
with a pretty bad scenario caused by these kinds of errors.
