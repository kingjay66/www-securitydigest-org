Today I tried to send a FAX to a local lawyer.  It dialed but instead of
reading the paper it generated a copy of a document from the lawyer to a
Canadian Embassy many thousands of miles away.  Moral: Don't use FAX if you
want it to get there!

Recently I had a coworker at our HQ arrange to "pull me in" to a conference
call a vendor had arranged.  We had a conversation about their product, after
which I hung up.  After I left, apparently the vendor techs all discussed the
number of bugs in their product, and how glad they were that I would not be
able to evaluate it for several weeks, since that gave them time to fix them.

How did I know this?  My coworker noticed them still on the line, and
after turning "mute" on with his phone, rejoined the conversation.

The risks are obvious.  This was a computer security vendor no less!

Subject: Apple Computer Distributes a CD-ROM with a "Trojan Horse"

Apple Software Dispatch is Apple Computer's new way to buy application
software. They send you a CD (mine came unsolicited in the mail, but there
are ads for it in MacWeek, etc.). You run an application on the CD,
register your CD by a code that comes with the package, and then you can
call an 800 number to purchase applications on the CD. You give them a
credit card number - they give you some code number that unlocks/decrypts
the application.

While the documentation nowhere says so, the registration process 
installs a System Extension onto your startup disk.

[Technical digression - System Extensions (sometimes called INITs), are
pieces of code that execute at system initialization time that add to or
modify the function of Apple System Software. They do this by intercepting
calls to system routines and executing before, in place of, or after the
builtin routine. This is considered a normal practice, and is used by Apple
and 3rd parties extensively. A serious Macintosh configuration issue is the
possibility that some set of extension conflict in some way. For example,
if they intercept the same system routine , they may make the assumption
that they are the only piece of code to do so. Debugging this can be time
consuming - the last extension you add may uncover problems with an
extension that to that time has been trusted and stable. Thus, careful Mac
users are _very_ conservative about adding extensions and do things like
configure anti-viral software to warn of new extensions being added.]

The documentation left me with the impression that some sort of data file
with decryption keys or, perhaps, licensing information, would be left on
my system, though, again, there is nothing that says that. The only warning
I had was from anti-viral software, telling me that a new extension was
being put in place when I ran the registration program.

Unfortunately, on my system, this extension clearly conflicted with
something, rendering my disks (hard, floppy _and_ CD-ROM) unmountable.
Removing the extension fixed the problem. Booting with Software Dispatch as
the only extension also worked, so Software Dispatch is not inherently
buggy - it just suffers from classic Mac extension conflict problems.
However, since this extension is not mentioned in the documentation, there
are people who are in for a rude shock. And, since the symptoms for this
problem are just a dialog saying "This disk is unreadable on this
Macintosh. Would you like to initialize it?", there are people who are
going to waste endless amounts of time, restoring and rebuilding their
disks needlessly. After they do that, if they still don't notice the
Software Dispatch extension, they still won't have fixed the problem. And,
if they reinstall Software Dispatch, they'll see the problem again.

I can't believe that I'm the only person to whom this has happened. While I
run a fairly complex Mac, I am relatively conservative about system
extensions - with one or two exceptions, the extensions I have aren't
particularly funky, they're from Apple or 3rd party vendors. I expect that
Apple will be suffering from real grief about this, and, regrettably, they
deserve every little bit of it.

I should note that I did report this to Software Dispatch tech support. They
took all the information and promised to get back to me.  I'm still waiting.

  Mitterrand Guard Says Elysee Ordered Phone Bugging

  PARIS, Dec 2 (Reuter) - A former senior security guard of French President

  TOKYO (UPI) -- Police arrested a former bank official and two advertising
  agency executives Friday on suspicion of fraud for allegedly stealing nearly
  $550,000 using a computer.

The article goes on to explain that the accused, Masuji Yamashita (a bank
official), and Yasuo Ueno and Yoichiro Suzuki (clients) are alleged to have
made 15 fraudulent computer entries transferring the equivalent of U$497,000
from Sakura Bank to the account of an advertising agency, Ken Enterprises.
The fraud occurred over about a month (1 Feb to 4 Mar 93).  "Yamashita
reportedly moved the money from Ken's checking account to its savings account
as cash deposits.  Ken Enterprises used the funds to service its payable
drafts."

  [Seems like over-commitment to client service.]

Compuserve, 7 Dec 1993:

    NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Fifteen salespeople at a car dealership were charged
  with using the credit records of more than 450 people to steal millions of
  dollars. 
    The salespeople tapped into credit reports through their computers, used
  the information to change the victims' addresses, and then ordered credit
  cards and ran up charges, Secret Service agent Peter A. Cavicchia said.
    They also allegedly used the credit information to obtain bank loans and
  cash advances."

The article goes on to say that the average theft was $7,500.  Although the
victims don't have to pay that amount, they do have to waste their time trying
to correct their credit records.  Apparently Autoland managers noticed the
excessive and unauthorized use of their computers and reported their
suspicions to the police.

o Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services currently

The risk to the patients is extortion.  In today's highly-charged atmosphere,
being identified as HIV-positive has about the same social effect as a bubo
during the Black Plague (even though in fact AIDS is not very communicable in
non-intimate social contacts).  I hope anyone victimized goes to the police
immediately if they are threatened with disclosure of their status.

CompuServe, 2 Dec 1993:

  Credit Scam Targets Mailboxes; 9 Postal Workers Among 40 Arrested in
  Washington Area Thefts (Serge F. Kovaleski / Washington Post Staff Writer)
 
  Thousands of Washington area residents have been targeted by sophisticated
  scam artists who have pilfered mail from homes and post offices to get
  credit cards, checkbooks and information that they have used to steal
  millions of dollars, authorities said.

The article continues with details of the fraud, none of which will surprise
readers of RISKS.  Salient features:

o    Thieves monitor external mailboxes on homes for weeks in wealthy
     neighbourhoods to steal credit cards and new cheques arriving in the
     mail.
     
o    Pre-approved applications for credit cards are particularly
     vulnerable, since the thieves fill them out, send them in, and then
     intercept them shortly after postal delivery.

o    The thieves impersonate bank officials to obtain personal information 
     from victims, then impersonate the victims when they call banks for
     new personal identification numbers.
     
o    Some victims have seen as much as $300,000 stolen through their
     accounts; the credit card companies (which is to say, all users of the
     cards) have swallowed the charges.  

o    A task force has been formed including members of "the Postal Service, 
     the Immigration an Naturalization Service, the Drug Enforcement 
     Administration, D.C. police and other local law enforcement agencies."
     
o    Theft has struck hundreds of people in some neighbourhoods, and
     residents are organizing to repair insecure mailboxes and watch over
     them.
     
o    Some residents are renting Post Office boxes.
     
o    Current credit-card and bank fraud cost about $4 billion a year in the
     U.S.
     
Banks and credit-card providers have been reluctant to discuss security
measures [trusting to the discredited principle of security by obscurity--MK].
Nonetheless, the authors note, certain changes are already being implemented:
     
o    Some new credit cards don't work until the card owner confirms receipt
     [This alone will not stop the thieves, but see next point.--MK]
     
o    To authenticate the card holder before activating the card, officials
     will use a personal profile, asking for previously-registered details 
     of personal life.  [This won't stop the criminals who fill out new
     card applications and give false information.--MK]
     
o    The credit thieves use classical scavenging techniques: stealing all
     mail to learn about a victim, or dumpster diving to retrieve discarded 
     documents with tidbits of personal information.
     
o    Some thieves have re-recorded fraudulent information on discarded,
     expired cards and used them successfully.

Additional comments by MK:
     
At first glance, one might ask how such crimes are relevant for RISKS readers.
I think we should be watching these developments because credit cards have
become the most widely-used access-control tokens on the planet.  Because their
use is usually mediated by other people, it may not seem obvious to naive users
that they are in fact using computer networks for electronic data interchange.
It is when credit and debit cards are personally inserted into an automatic
teller machine that the close link to computer networks should be evident to
everyone.

As access-control tokens, most credit cards are weaker than debit cards.  At
least debit cards require manual input of a personal identification number
(PIN) at all times.  Why don't credit card companies require a PIN too?  

In Canada, some banks send credit cards only by registered mail.  This sounds
good in theory, but in fact I have never been asked for identification.  I
have often sent a clerk to collect registered mail and parcels without any
trouble at all.  Holding the notification card seems to be all that is
demanded by clerks at Canada Post.  We must sign a register, but such
signatures cannot be verified and are thus useless.  Perhaps banks will be
interested in requesting improved authentication measures by postal employees.

In the U.S., some credit cards include a digitized photograph laminated into
the card.  This technique presumably reduces fraudulent use in person, but
does not yet affect use in banking machines or by phone.  Photos would not
stop fraud by thieves who steal application forms and create new cards, but it
would help when legitimate cards are stolen.

Use of cards over the phone must be the easiest channel for abuse. Because
there is no PIN, there is no authentication at all.  Simply reciting a number
suffices to debit the credit-card account as long as the card is currently
valid.  If a PIN _were_ required, how could it be recorded by the sales person
without compromising the card's security?  I think there should be a method
for entering card numbers and PINs via touch-tone phone panel; such a system
should preclude the order-taker from seeing the account number or at least the
PIN.  If a direct link between the customer's phone and the validation system
were not feasible or affordable, an encryption routine on the receiving end
could convert the transmitted PIN into a temporary, time/date-dependent
version which would be unusable at any other time.  This cryptogram would then
be manually entered into the validation system by the order-taker.

Decisions on improving security boil down to cost and benefit, as always.  As
long as interest rates and card services charges are still acceptable to the
victims, er, users of these services, there will be little incentive to
change.  I look forward to seeing a credit card company with the vision to
protect its users and succeed in lowering costs as a result of lowered fraud.
Then the industry will change its ways.

I'm afraid I disagree that this echoes my account. Although Udo may have
correctly reported what the TV said, I find the account misleading. I'd like
to clarify some differences.

First, `causes': the final report from the Polish authorities will be *the*
legally valid document enumerating the factors. The major players are all
discussing their favored candidates, but there is not unanimity. At least one
candidate factor mentioned in my article has not been reported yet by the
media [RISKS is sometimes first!]. It was not on Udo's list, which is a strict
subset of the candidates so far. There may be more that we're not aware of
yet.  Factor 3 reported by Udo is a misleading statement of the braking logic.

Udo reports that Airbus `agreed to modify its control system'.  I wonder. The
so-called `modification' has been available as an option to operators for some
time, and has been installed on delivered A320s.  Airbus has already noted
that this option is available to operators. This can't count as modification.
