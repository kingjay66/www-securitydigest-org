Subject: "Computer" gets exam results wrong:  Rounding error

The Australia and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists is the professional
body regulating training and qualification in anesthesiology in this area.
To become a Fellow of the College trainees take two exams. Each is composed
of three parts: a multiple choice paper, essays, and an oral exam.  The oral
is held some weeks after the written papers. Candidates are told their
results at the end of the day of oral examinations.

At a recent sitting of the primary exam a number of candidates failed. 
"Three or four" (out of an estimated sixty sitting the oral) were
contacted a few days later to be told that they had, in fact, passed. 

The "explanation" they were given was as follows. The exam format had
changed. Instead of three essay questions, there were ten. The essays were
weighted (as before) at 30% of the overall mark. A new computer system (not
specified) was used to calculate the scores. "It" had rounded all figures
down. The unlucky/lucky candidates marks had been rounded below the
pass/fail threshold after division. Rounding was not a problem before, as
the raw essay scores were merely added to the exam total (30 marks max =
30%).

We look forward to a fuller explanation in the next examiners' bulletin of
how the College came to use such a foolish computer program.

Subject: The Royal Majesty revisited (RISKS-17.19)

The Royal Majesty was in _The Boston Globe_ again today (11 Aug 1995). The
explanation given for its being off course is that the GPS antenna failed
and the alarm was not loud enough to alert the crew to switch to Loran. So
it wasn't "our" fault.  The software worked perfectly, and the software
methodology worked perfectly.

Yeah, sure. The problem is that just churning out code is the trivial aspect
of the problem of designing systems. A much much harder problem is the
ad-hoc integration of disparate systems. Software methodologies do little
good unless we can deal with real-world interactions and unless the system
design takes the right responsibility. Seems like no system really took
responsibility for navigation. Of course, the Captain is responsible, but
that's moot if the subsystems are reliable enough that constantly watching a
perfect system is counterproductive.

How do we design systems that can take responsibility for component failures
and how to do we get the components to cooperate? We don't have any good
answers. Ironically, if we do manage to get a handle on the integration and
responsibility problems, much of the methodology used to build individual
systems become less important since, theoretically, the individual systems
should become simpler and less critical.

What work is being done to deal with the issues that arise as systems
interact? There is work being done on component integration and building
standard building blocks but rigid integration is an issue. What happens
when subsystems fail? The problem is that failures are not well-defined..
How does one report a failure that isn't in the semantics of the client? The
more serious problem with failures is that that they tend to occur when
things are going wrong (of course) and thus frustrate attempts towards neat
solutions.  The user of a GPS system might not even realize that there is a
flag that can switch reporting between magnetic and true North? What happens
when the switch flips? (*67 is another example of this (That's implicit
reference, but readers of Risks should recognize the "toggle caller ID"
problem).

As a long-time reader of RISKS, I see repeated complaints about how systems
are not reliable, but I view reliability as a crutch. The problem is not
assuring that all components are perfectly reliable, but rather delivering a
sufficient service out of unreliable components. Any navigation system is an
unreliable component.

Sufficient in the case of the Royal Majesty is first assuring that it
doesn't sink and secondly that it gets to the right destination on the right
course.  The rest are details. At least it didn't sink in the middle of the
ocean.

This is an interesting point. It brings to mind the issue of regulation and
legal responsibilities of database owners.

Are there any efforts in the US to make database owners responsible and
legally liable for the accuracy of their data, the access to it, and the
uses of it? Thus, a database owner might be subject to criminal or civil
liability if it contained inaccurate information regarding an individual
(regardless of the purpose of the database); if someone gained unauthorized
access to it or abused authorized access (these might be regarded as failure
by the owner to take adequate security measures); or if someone used that
data to commit a crime.

One could imagine an all-encompassing scenario where a database record
incorrectly listed a home address, a stalker gains unauthorized access to
the record, goes to the wrong address and murders the wrong victim in the
dark (of course, this might happen just by using the phone book or other
public records, but people know that these records are not always accurate
and up to date, whereas they assume computerized records are). The database
owner might justifiably argue that they cannot be responsible for the
inappropriate use of that data when it is used without their knowledge, but
should be liable on the other two counts. If, on the other hand, the data is
knowingly made available to someone engaged in illegal activity, the owner
should be liable.

Database owners would probably argue that such liability would be burdensome
and would simply be bureaucratic invasion of their enterprise. The irony of
this argument would probably never occur to them. However, there might be
several benefits to society. First, a database owner who was not diligent in
ensuring accuracy or protection of the data could be held accountable. How
many people's lives have been disrupted, sometimes severely, because some
municipal database couldn't handle someone with the same name? And the
response of the database owner? Gee, we're sorry, maybe you should change
your name. Second, it would be another charge to use against someone engaged
in illegal activity, ensuring that they are punished even if they were able
to evade other charges (remember why Al Capone went to jail?). Third, it
could discourage database owners from storing such detailed data in the
first place, in favor of anonymous systems.  Make it a hassle for them if
they can't justify it.

Right now massive collection of incidental data takes place because it is so
easy, it just costs storage space, which is cheap. There is no risk in it.
Put some legal risk into it and people will start being a little more
careful, storing only what is truly necessary and keeping a closer eye on
it. An analogy is a financial institution, where people voluntarily give
over access to and control of their funds. What bank would be silly enough
to leave the cash lying out in the open? What bank would stay in business if
they did not take adequate measures to protect that money? What bank would
be permitted to knowingly launder money for illegal activities? If we simply
replace money with information (which is generally already the case in the
age of the plastic card!), we have a good initial model for responsibility
and liability.

Far be it for me to propose greater bureaucracy, but the apparent total lack
of responsibility of database owners cries out for regulation. I infer from
several items about database abuse in the UK that they require databases to
be registered in some way with the government. I don't know if that has
worked out well or not, but it's not a bad idea when backed up with some
teeth. A database can be a dangerous weapon.

Jeez, I was afraid of this...

I do not know this poster, but I originated the cautionary  notice re
Fluke meters to a very small group of electrical safety people, and it is
spreading out of control.  The info was VERY PRELIMINARY at the time, & I
do not want to set off any kind of anti-Fluke stampede.  The facts quoted
below are accurate for the most part.  We did discover this flukey defect
(pun intended) in one of our labs.  Fluke has NOT totally duplicated the
condition at the factory, but they have been able to get the meters to
freeze up under limited conditions.  Meanwhile, we have sent the 2 meters
in question back to the factory for analysis.  I will post the results to
this newsgroup.  I would like to emphasize that thus far, Fluke has been
very cooperative, straightforward and concerned.  Anyone in the business
knows that their meters are top notch. 

By the way, if anyone out there uses these particular meters to test
500-1000 vDC, I would appreciate it if you could do the experiment
described [in the previous message] and forward the results to me.
I will compile and forward to Fluke.  Thanks-

Subject: Re: Oakland ATC Problem (RISKS-17.24)

   In RISKS-17.24, Peter G. Neumann cited a _San Francisco Chronicle_
article that asserted that the Oakland ARTCC covers an area of 18-million
square miles.  This cannot be so, even if the airspace over the eastern
Pacific Ocean is included.  Of course the aircraft at greatest RISK were not
evenly distributed.  Aircraft in the terminal areas in Northern California
and Reno were controlled by the Approach Control facilities or the Control
Towers.  For enroute aircraft, the matter of clear skies could have been
more of a RISK than a help, since there are fewer aircraft (or none)
purposefully flying under Visual Flight Rules when the weather is bad.
 
   The Airman's Information Manual and Federal Aviation Regulations specify
the procedures to be used for enroute aircraft when radio communication is
lost.  Those procedures are geared toward a problem with one aircraft rather
than with the ARTCC, but, particularly with the abundance of military radar
facilities in California and Nevada, most aircraft should have been able to
establish contact with some other radar-equipped ATC facility.

   [I thought about the seeming absurdity of the 18M-SqMile area when I
   first saw it in the Chron, and meant to flag it in RISKS-17.24 -- but 
   then forgot.  "Paul M. Karagianis" <KARYPM@SJUVM.bitnet> noted that such 
   a circle has a radius of over 2393 miles, and I observe that the Page 1
   map appears to show a somewhat prolate shape with a pseudoradius of

   200,000 square miles.  Off by a factor of 90?  Not bad at all.  PGN]

Subject: Oakland Center Outage a RISK?

In RISKS-17.24, Peter Neumann notes the outage at the Oakland
En-Route Air-Traffic Control Center. He reports:

     Fortunately, the weather over northern California was good, and
     en-route flights could operate visually.

A commercial flight is under en-route control, the least demanding flight
regime, when it is not near its airport of take-off or landing.  The
air-traffic control system is designed to be safe in the event of total
communications failure. Airplanes have altitude and routing requirements
(`clearances'), along with information on future expected clearances, along
with precise procedures to follow, that define the entire flight at any
time.  Flight rules require that the FAA guarantee that this space-time slot
is free from conflict.  Controllers lose efficiency significantly under
communications failures by losing the ability dynamically to modify
clearances, but in principle safety is not compromised. It's not clear there
would be any computer-related safety RISK.

In positive control areas at lower altitude covering airports of take-off
and landing, there may be a risk at the exact moment of outage, since
airplanes are often given partial routing clearance (e.g. `radar vectors')
to sequence them for landing and take-off. No such areas were affected
in this incident.

The rules allow flights to operate `visually' only below 18,000 feet,
usually attained by a commercial jet within, say, 10 minutes of take-off.
Flights into and out of SFO operate under positive control of the terminal
area controller at and below 12,000 feet, and this control remained
available (I don't have an SFO chart or regs handy -- I believe the positive
control extends to 12,000 feet but I may be mistaken.) Between 12,000 feet
and 18,000 feet, the crew must be looking out of the window to spot and
avoid other planes flying under `visual' rules and not under positive
control. They *must* do this, comm failure or not: the en-route controller
may issue `traffic advisories' but these are not definitive information
about other traffic flying under visual rules. TCAS may help.  These
intermediate altitudes are thus potential `trouble spots' and some thought
has been given to providing some positive-control-only airspace for all
altitudes on the ascent/descent routes in the vicinity of major airports, so
that commercial flights may fly entirely in positive-control-only airspace.

It may have been more `fortunate' had the weather been bad at the
intermediate altitudes.  Potential conflicts with visual-rules traffic
do not arise where visual flight is not possible.

Of course, all this presumes that everyone follows the rules.

Subject: Re: Oakland ATC Problem (RISKS-17.24)

While triggered by the news of the Oakland air-traffic control center
outage, hopefully this can give RISKS readers something new to worry about
also.

Both the article I read in my morning paper, and the item in RISKS regarding
the outage at the Oakland air-traffic control center seemed to indicate that
this was just another example of problems with the aged computers being used
for air-traffic control.

In this particular case it would not matter what method or equipment was
being used, the outage would have occurred.  The only way to avoid it would
be if the entire air-traffic control center was operated by a strictly
mechanical means, as in with falling water turning wheels and moving levers.
The outage was caused by a LOSS OF POWER (hence the loss of radar and radio
contact, and probably lights also, is not surprising).  The real problem
being poor planning by the designers in making sure of a constant flow of
electricity.

This hits home because my job is with a public power utility, keeping the
computers going that keep the electricity on.  The power grid across the
country must constantly be kept in "tune", or it will fail.  As people turn
switches on or off, generators must change their output.  As loads go up and
down capacitors and reactors must be switched in and out of the system to
keep power flowing efficiently.  (this is an extreme simplification of
electric power system control).  Each company does this (or has it done by
another utility) by monitoring the power system every few seconds using, you
guessed it, computers.

  While usually nondescript or at least unlabeled, you may have noticed at
times a power company building resembling a small bunker with some
combination of fencing and electronic surveillance.  In other cases the
building may look normal from the outside, but once inside the security
becomes quite apparent.  Their are two reasons for this.  The first is that
the control operation must continue no matter what the weather.  Our
building is designed to take a direct hit by a tornado and not effect the
control room personnel.  The second reason is to keep the bad guys out.  You
could quite easily black out large areas of the immediate control area (to
disable alarm systems and screw up police and other emergency
communications?) and theoretcally pull down the entire grid (eastern or
western) from within one of the control rooms of a larger utility.

In the past the computer systems have been electronically separated from the
outside world.  As the older systems (ours is late 1960's hardware with 70's
software) are replaced, the tentacles of networking are getting hold.  In
order to insure we do not lose the operation of these systems we start with
multiple computer systems, each of which will take over for the other(s) if
a hardware or software problem arises.  But now I come full circle back to
the air-traffic control center.  Our building has two separate power feeds,
coming from sub-stations and transmission lines located miles apart.  Should
both of these fail, there is a backup generator with many days of fuel.  If
this fails there are two redundant battery UPSs (Uninterruptable Power
Systems) that will each last several hours.  In addition, internal switch
gear (power distribution), and cooling systems are either redundant or sized
such that remaining units can handle the load of a failed unit.  We believe
we have minimized the risk of a power outage inside of the building.  This
is expensive to build and maintain and comes out of your electric bill, but
the alternative would be increased numbers and duration of power outages.
Have you ever tried to live even a few hours, especially in extremes of
weather, without electricity?  Would you like to be flying into an airport
without electricity?  Why did the planners building the air-traffic control
center not think a constant supply of power would be important?

And finally, why is it that when you have tons of machinery, a lot of highly
volatile fuel and a couple of hundred people going several hundred miles an
hour 40,000 feet in the sky (in direct opposition to gravity and friction),
you are allowed to "remove your seat belt and move freely about the cabin".
But when you are firmly planted on the ground creeping along at less than 10
miles per hour you are sternly warned to "keep your seat belt fastened until
the plane has come to a complete stop".

This is, unfortunately, not true. The only way to tell strong encryption
from weak encryption is to actually go about trying to break the encrypted
message. Thus, this policy would imply that *all* encrypted messages would
be broken, in order to separate out the weak from the strong.

Faced with this as an alternative, I would certainly prefer the Clipper

Politicians love vague phrases like "the needs of the majority..." the
RISK here is that you can make such blanket statements without any
statistics and if you choose the period properly (say 1950-1970) for
determining the need, you may even be right.

This is the one that confuses me every time I see it (and I have seen
it a lot) but it really seems to be popular among the clueless. WHY
should good crypto immediately attract attention ? Consider the following:

1) Person has pgp. Encrypts file.
2) Person then double encrypts with "approved" crypto.
3) Sends file.

Now the only way anyone is going to notice is if they routinely decrypt
*everything*.

Also, this only works because a pgp-encrypted file advertises the fact.
What if Steganography is used ? Message in the lower bits of a JPEG ?
CD-ROM OTP ? Navajo ? or does the proposal include a requirement that
only messages understood by the gov be sent ? Fact is that while it
is fairly easy to separate plain text from "something else", it is very 
difficult to account for all the "something elses". IMNSHO, YAPBI.
