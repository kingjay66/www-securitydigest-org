Subject: New Yorker Article on Potential Building Collapse: The 59-Story Crisis

	"If they built buildings they way we build software...."

	There's a fascinating article in the current issue of The New Yorker
  ("The Fifty-Nine-Story Crisis", Joe Morgenstern, The New Yorker, vol. LXXI,
  no. 14, May 29, 1995, pp. 45-53) that should be of great interest to all
  with an interest in software engineering.  It's the story of the discovery
  and patching of a design/implementation flaw in a 59-story building in New
  York City (the Citicorp Center) that had the potential to cause the building
  to collapse disastrously under high winds.

	The parallels with software are uncanny, because the reasons the 
  problem occurs are exactly the things that occur in so many software projects:

  1. An unusual or novel aspect to the problem. (Building around an existing
     structure, a church).

  2. A creative, innovative solution that required new design & analysis.
     (Putting the main support columns in the middle of each side of the
     building, rather than at the corners.)

  3. Not quite getting all the implications & analysis of the innovation 
     right.  (The reviewers of the design treated some special, new
     diagonal wind braces as trusses rather than columns, thereby
     disregarding a required standard and exempting them from a safety
     standard.)

  4. A critical change in the specification made by the contractor during
     construction to save time & money that was not reflected back to the 
     designers and/or re-analyzed/reviewed for its impact that greatly 
     weakened the design.

  5. A resulting flaw that would only show up in heavy load, and not
     under normal use/test.

	Anyone interested in making software engineering a profession
  will also find the article of interest.  Everyone involved exhibited
  a high degree of professionalism throughout the discovery, analysis,
  and fixing of the problem. (Even the lawyers!)   Another amazing thing
  is that there's been little if any publicity of this before (at least
  to my knowledge; this is the first report I remember seeing).  Part of
  that may be due to the fact there just happened to be a newspaper
  strike going on in New York City at the crucial time.)

  WARNING:  Do not start reading this until you have time to finish it; I
	    found it a case of "can't put it down" reading.


  [Note: I'm unable to always follow the risks forum closely, but haven't
  seen anything on this in there, either recently or in the past.
  It will certainly appeal to risks readers.  Apologies if others
  have submitted this or it's been covered in the past & I just missed
  it, in which case simply hit the delete key.  Might note also that
  if people find this interesting, an interesting book on similar
  things that I read a couple of years ago while doing some investigating
  on operating system reliability is: "Why Buildings Fall Down", by
  Matthys Levy & Mario Salvador, New York, W.W. Norton, 1992.  One of
  the conclusions is that many buildings fail due to a lack of redundancy,
  which I find very interesting since very few operating systems (or
  software of any kind) has any kind of redundancy designed or built
  into it.]

Subject: Military (hi-res) GPS to be opened up?

On 31 May 1995, I heard a story about GPS on NPR-All Things Considered of
interest to RISKS readers. Apologies for any omissions, I didn't take notes
so the following is from memory.

A "blue-ribbon" panel just issued a report on whether to open all of the
satellite-based Global Positioning System (GPS) to civilian use. As it works
now, GPS transmits a low-resolution signal for civilian use, which has
random errors added to it (resolution: about 100m), and an encrypted signal
for military use that's much more precise.  The civilian capability was made
available worldwide after the KAL 007 downing over Soviet Airspace during
the Reagan administration, and it is now widely used not just by ships and
planes, but also by hikers and tourists (a palmtop GPS locator sells for
about $300 in the US).

The panel concluded that the hi-res signal had to be opened to use by all.
The military's objection is that enemies could use it to e.g. guide missiles
(one of their own applications) to US targets.  They're proposing that the
error may be increased, or the system turned off altogether, at the
discretion of the US President, in "time of war".  Civilian aviation
authorities aren't thrilled about using a system on which they don't have
their "hand on the switch," as an official from the British aviation
authority said.

The cat may already be out of the bag. FAA is testing a system that uses the
civilian GPS on an aircraft in concert with a ground-based civilian GPS,
through a radio link. Since the ground based GPS knows its coordinates, it
can listen to the signal from satellites, figure the error, and inform its
airborne partner. Precision is in the 1 meter range now, enough to put a
plane on a glide path and land it in dense fog.

The various RISKs are left as an exercise to the reader.

Subject: British man convicted as malicious virus writer

Finally, after months of delay and postponement, a 26 year old 
unemployed computer programmer, Chris Pile, pleaded guilty Friday,
May 26, to eleven charges related to computer virus writing. The 
case at Plymouth Crown Court was the first of its kind in British legal 
history since passage of the Computer Misuse Act in 1990.

Pile, known as the Black Baron, pleaded guilty to hacking into business
computers and planting the computer viruses known as SMEG/Pathogen and
SMEG/Queeg. The case followed an investigation by fraud squad officers and
experts from Scotland Yard. The eleven charges stemmed from a period between
October 1993 and April 1994 when the Black Baron obtained unauthorized
access to computer programs and seeded them with viruses he'd written. He
also pleaded guilty to one charge of inciting others to plant his viruses.
Authorities state that tracing the viruses and repairing damage caused by
them cost "well in excess of half a million pounds." Pile was released on
bail and the trial adjourned for two months to allow the defence to prepare
a pre-sentencing report.

Pile, a Devon man, wrote the SMEG viruses which quickly gained the attention
of anti-virus developers worldwide in mid-1994. Due to publicity on the nets
and in the computer underground, they were rapidly distributed around the
Internet at approximated the same time Pile was arrested in connection with
the charges on which he was tried.

Sentencing will probably depend upon the interpretation of Pile's intent to
incite others to write viruses using his "SMEG" encryption kernel which was
distributed internationally to virus exchange underground bulletin board
systems in mid-1994. It is an arcane issue which calls for the examination
and tracking of a computer archive containing a detailed technical "how-to"
on installing Pile's "SMEG" virus encryption kernel into new viruses, the
encryption software and a sample demonstration virus.

In 1993, another English virus writer, Stephen Kapp, was arrested in
connection with telephone fraud charges.  Kapp was known as the "President
of ARCV," or ARCV virus writing group which stood for Association of Really
Cruel Viruses.

It is worth noting that in 1992 at the height of the Michelangelo virus
scare, few virus writers were easily identified.  This is no longer the
case. Due to the growth in computer networks and an increasing desire for
underground network celebrity, many of the most prominent virus writers in
the world live in plain sight.

Australia's Clinton Haines, a student at the University of Queensland, is
responsible for writing and putting the Dudley and NoFrills computer viruses
into the wild in his country.  At various times since 1992, these viruses
have infected SunCorp, a large Australian insurance firm; Australian Telecom
and the Australian Taxation Office, which is similar to the IRS.  Haines has
been interviewed at length by the Australian newsmedia.

In America, James Gentile, a teenager living in San Diego, has written a
number of viruses, all of which have emerged in the wild.  His Satan Bug
crashed US Secret Service networks in 1993.  Since then another of his
creations, known as Natas - Satan spelled backwards - has become one of the
most common computer viruses in North America. It has been reported as far
south in the hemisphere as Argentina.

the packet flow...  It is past time for the deployment of encrypted

>From the Associated Press news wire via CompuServe's Executive News Service:

Pricey Pay Phones,, By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer 

WASHINGTON (AP, 29 May 1995) -- Between appointments, Mary Viar dashed to a
pay phone in Hagerstown, Md., to wish her daughter in Pittsburgh a happy
birthday. A week later, she got the bill: $21.39 for her 22-minute call.
For the same amount, she could have called Paris and talked for half an hour.

Key points:

o	FCC handling growing number of complaints about unexpectedly
	high prices for calls made through pay-phones:  4,280 complaints 
	in the last 12 months.

o	Beware of phones controlled by "MD-based Oncor Communications, 
	whose rates are three to four times as high as those of the 
	big phone companies."

o	Users have filed 800 complaints to the FCC about Oncor's rates.

o	Hotels and pay-phone owners charge the high rates even if user 
	requests connection to their own lower-cost carrier.

o	Users can bypass the automatic charges by rogue phone companies
	by dialling directly to use their own 800 or 950 access codes 
	for more reasonable phone carriers.

o	Some companies add a surcharge to each call and share the revenue/
	with "the hotel, bar or other establishment where a public phone
is located...."

o	"The FCC said Oncor's surcharges alone have totaled as much 
	as $10 per call."

In a related article, the author included the following information:

	If you believe you have been unfairly charged for a long-distance 
	call, you can file a complaint to the FCC, which oversees 
	interstate service. For local calls, contact the state's 
	public utility commission, which oversees local phone service. 
	You may also want to send a letter to the state attorney general,
	many of whom have raised concerns about rate gouging.

	Complaints may be sent to the Federal Communications Commission,
	Enforcement Division, 2025 M Street, N.W., Washington, D.C., 
	20554. Additional information also can be obtained by calling 
	the FCC at 202-418-0190.

Subject: Cellular Roaming broken

Last week I was trying to use my cellular phone in Seattle. I couldn't get
it to work because it is a Boston based phone and the Boston database was
being upgraded last week and, basically, got screwed up. I didn't now about
this till Thursday evening but apparently it was a week long problem
according to the Boston Cellular One. The Seattle people said that they
couldn't do anything about it. The first time I called customer support the
suggested solution was to power off and try again in a little while since
they were clueless as to the cause of the problem. Later I spoke to someone
who was more familiar yet was still unable to help.

Perhaps no one really roams on these phones, but one would think a major
outage like this would get more attention and be taken more seriously. But
then, the reality of the cellular network is that it is not a reliable
service. Before automatic roaming you'd have to register locally but that
was only available on a 9 to 5 basis.

Perhaps this is a nonrisk. By not providing a really reliable service,
people are not going to be overly dependent upon the network. Actually, they
will be dependent upon it for emergency services until the first emergency
...

A recent trade publication article contained inaccuracies regarding the
purpose and operation of the Registration Wizard, the on-line registration
application in Windows 95.  The purpose of the Registration Wizard is to
offer an electronic version of the paper-based Registration Card that
traditionally comes with all Microsoft products.  The Registration Wizard
asks for similar information to that listed in the paper-based registration
card, such as your hardware configuration and applications usage.  Just like
with a traditional registration card, providing this information is
optional.  A customer using the Registration Wizard receives dialog prompts
asking them whether they would like to send this information.  They must
actively click 'send' for any information to be sent.

There are lots of benefits to customers that provide this information - such
as product update mailings and improved product support because the product
support engineer can refer to your exact system configuration information
on-line.  In the end, though, sending this information is optional and a
conscious decision by the user.

Microsoft traditionally does not make information gathered during the
registration process available to third-parties.  If the customer chooses to
send system and software information to Microsoft with the Registration
Wizard, it is a one-way, one-time occurrence and takes place at the time the
customer selects 'send.'

Subject: MS SMS product, others pose risks

The June 5 Information Week has a big product review story about network-
distributed PC management products which using software on PC's and on
servers to let administrators inventory PC contents, update PC files,
distribute software, monitor usage, and so-on and so-forth.  Two of the
products, including most notably Microsoft's SMS, will put any PC into
promiscuous mode to sniff packets from the LAN's to which it may be attached
and forward the data to another machine for analysis.

I feel disappointed that the story doesn't even mention the possibility that
these products may pose security risks.  Three such occur to me instantly:
that people can place bad data onto PC's using the distribution facilities;
that people can retrieve confidential data from PC's using the inspection
and monitoring facilities; and that people can steal confidential data from
the network using the remote packet sniffing facilities.  I'm sure there are
many more problems.  Not only does the story ignore risks, but consequently
it does not mention or rate any product features which might mitigate such
risks (e.g., schemes by which PC's could authenticate purported management
server commands before responding to them).

Doesn't anyone out there in the software business give a hoot about these
issues?

Malcolm Vincent from a UK email address writes:

It may not even be necessary to have a US based account.  The mechanism
used is to do a DNS name lookup on your IP number.  However there are
plenty of non-US sites with DNS names which look American (end in .com for
instance).  Some of the sites have weaker checks, merely requiring you to
agree by virtue of downloading that you are a US citizen.

There are plenty of routes whereby crypto software can leave the US with
very low risk of detection.  Consider, for instance, that the software
could be encrypted with PGP, and mailed through a chain of encrypting
anonymous remailers.  In fact something of this nature must already have
happened for it is available for ftp in the UK from Oxford University:

	ftp://ftp.ox.ac.uk/pub/crypto/misc/nautilus-0.9.0.tar.gz

Also, ITAR only clearly holds if you are a US citizen, currently living in
the US.  I don't believe this situation (ftp from outside the US of US
export controlled software) has ever been explored in court, but it is not
immediately obvious that a US law which makes an action illegal in the US
could be held to apply outside the US.  Particularly as the physical
jurisdiction in question does not have a similar law.

The whole question rests on the legal interpretation of the action of ftping
a file, which jurisdiction is ftp initiator considered to be in.  A
non-computer based example which could be used as a metaphor: obtaining
information from a foreigner on the phone.  Say that a US citizen had made a
phone call to the former Soviet Union and had requested KGB classified
information, information which was freely available in the US, would the US
person have committed an offense on Russian soil and hence expect to be
extradited?  The telephone example is very similar to the modern
computerised example, ftp is merely an automated information retrieval
system.

Another somewhat related risk, is people outside the US posting crypto code
to USENET, for instance my sig file below implements RSA encryption in 3
lines of perl.  If you are not familiar with encryption schemes, RSA is one
of the most secure public key encryption schemes, and is the one used in
PGP.  It is also very firmly on the ITAR export control list.

Information on the sig is at:

	http://dcs.ex.ac.uk/~aba/rsa/

Some US folks are printing a T-shirt with this code on it, in honour of
ITAR, to produce an export controlled "munitions" T-shirt.  Also on the web
page is postscript for a 1x4" mailing label with the code as handed out by
New York lawyer Duncan Frissell at Computers, Freedom and Privacy '95 - for
an export-controlled mailing label.  A picture of one of these labels was
printed on the front page of the business section of the New York Times
(April 10th).  

   [As I recall, the left margins were (intentionally?) fuzzied.  PGN]

In using this sig, there is the risk that news distribution paths cross the
US borders a few times on the way, does this constitute "export"?  What
about a mailing list, members will receive copies via the US list server.
Some unsuspecting US usenet reader might quote the sig by accident.

Living in the UK, I feel fairly confident of the safety, and legality of
using my sig, but what about larger programs posted by those outside the US.
I mean if a non-US citizen living outside the US were to fetch nautilus from
the Oxford ftp site and post it (speaking hypothetically here of course)
uuencoded to sci.crypt, would that person be in trouble?  I am not sure that
this would be a good idea, but it is an interesting question from a legal
point of view.  But the perl rsa implementation is okay at 3 lines?  The
question arises about where the cut off point is: 10 lines, 1000?

This reminds me of something a colleague told me a few years ago, when her
employer first installed voice mail.  Mysteriously, the system would often
prevent her from leaving messages.  After the beep, she would start leaving
a message, and then at some point (usually near when she was almost
finished) it would cut her off, saying "That is not a valid code, please
re-enter your message", for no apparent reason.  Naturally, this drove her
up the wall.  It did not behave this way for anyone else.

It turns out that since her voice is pitched relatively high, the voice mail
system mistook her voice for one of the phone number tones.  I guess it
wasn't zero or one, or she would have gotten further instructions.  Last I
heard, she started leaving messages with her best James Earl
Jones-impression, and that worked.  I don't know if the problem was ever
fixed.  Again, the RISK is assuming certain things about the human voice.

Subject: Re: Negative Ions

This talk about positive and negative ions is really nothing new.  If you go
through the literature, especially the medical literature of the 60's and
70's on the subject, early research suggested (perhaps empirically in some
cases) that negatively ionized environment promote health, accelerated
healing, and an overall sense of well being.

I have had negative ion generators at home for years, but never too near
computers because `crashes' became too common.  In the late 70's and early
80's, companies were attempting to market humongous negative ion generators
for use in the air conditioning systems of new buildings to neutralize the
`positive ion effects of computer equipment.'

I've not yet seen a study of whether wholesale ionization of air-conditioned
buildings with no ventilation is a justified investment or not; some have
claimed that increased worker productivity and fewer sick days were an
immediate benefit.

But that assumes the computers still work.

I'd like to see more of the recent work on the subject, as my file 
cabinets full of these files are `antique' - more than 15 years old.
