Subject: Air Traffic Control Computers Down in Chicago

CNN reported that ATC primary computers and their backup went down for
several hours the morning of 12 Sep 1995 in Chicago.  Schedule delays of
over an hour were common.  Channel 9 local news in Washington, DC, reported
collision alarms going off when an American Eagle plane and private jet came
within 3.5 miles of each other during the downtime.

Subject: 911 call-box scams in California

Two Oakland men have apparently been ripping off (literally and
figuratively) freeway emergency call boxes, reverse-engineering the serial
numbers, and programming them into cellular phones, which they either sold
or used themselves.  More than $40,000 in cellular-phone calls (some from
New York) were attributable to those serial numbers.  About 200 call boxes
worth $250,000 were involved (mostly in Alameda County).  The remaining call
boxes have now been reprogrammed to be able to dial only 911, which might
end that scam --- unless they can be subsequently re-reprogrammed...

Subject: Is it possible to live without risks?

  [The following item is an excerpt from Paul's forthcoming book,
  "The Gatekeeper: The Gate Contracts" and seems very appropriate
  for inclusion in RISKS.  PGN]

        "George, is it possible to live without taking risks? I mean,
    without taking any risk at all."
        "No."
        "Why?"
        "Because almost everything we do has some danger to it, even if
    it's a small one."
        "Exactly.  Every time you get up, there is a risk that termites
    have eaten holes in the floor and it's no longer strong enough to
    hold you, or you might slip in the bathtub, or that you might get
    hit by a car crossing the street, or your deodorant might be too
    strong and give you a bad rash for a while.  
        "For most things we do, there is a tiny, infinitesimal risk of
    death or injury.  For some things, the risk is higher.  The range of
    risks run from the chance of dying from a heart attack, due to
    strain caused as a direct result of moving your arm, while brushing
    your teeth, being nil, all the way to stepping into an operating
    blast furnace, the risk of death being certainty.  Usually we do not
    weigh the risk, because it is too insignificant to matter.  But if
    there is a significant risk, you must decide if you can afford the
    cost.  Got me so far?"
        "Yes."
        "Risks do not always involve life and death issues.  Every action
    you take has some risks involved.  When we have to do something about
    those risks, we call that the consequences surrounding the action. 
    Nonetheless, it is important that people understand that actions have
    consequences, and that they must take responsibility for their actions. 
    This means they are acting in a manner that shows them to be responsible
    people.
        "All human misery stems from one cause, and one cause only:
    someone not taking responsibility for their actions. The result of 
    this directly causes that responsibility to be borne by someone
    else, or that their default caused the responsibility to not be 
    borne by anyone, and the consequences of that decision indirectly 
    causes someone else to bear the consequences of their act, and they
    suffer for other people's irresponsibility.
        "In any undertaking, as long as you consider the what the 
    consequences of your actions are, and are willing to take
    responsibility for them, and are in fact capable of taking on 
    those consequences, then you are acting in a responsible manner.
    You are still acting in a responsible manner even if you find out 
    you were wrong either way, as long as you took into consideration 
    all outcomes that could, by any reasonable analysis of the 
    matter, be expected from those actions."

Subject: At some schools, Windows 95 gets an 'F'

New Software Is Blamed for Networking Problems at a Few Universities
By SIMSON L. GARFINKEL, Special to the Mercury News
(C) 1995, Simson L. Garfinkel
Permission granted for electronic redistribution on the Internet

Microsoft's new Windows 95 operating system is playing havoc with the
computer networks at a few of the nation's universities, prompting at least
one university to issue a policy restricting students and faculty from
running Windows 95 on its computer network.

University administrators say problems have occurred when a user running
Windows 95 connects that machine to a network running the Novell Netware
operating system, one of the most popular versions for allowing a group of
computers to operate collectively, or over a ''network.''

Windows 95 has a new network feature that allows computer users to share
information stored on each other's computers. The problem, according to
people who have worked with the software, is that a computer running
Windows 95 can be configured to masquerade as an organization's Novell
Netware server, or centralized ''control'' computer. When that occurs, the
computers trying to talk with the server shut down, or ''crash,''
university officials say.

Utah State University already has instituted a policy forbidding its
students and staff from using a specific type of Netware networking feature
that's built into Windows 95.

''We have published a policy that we will come and break your kneecaps if
you do this, so please don't,'' said Joe Doupnik, a professor of electrical
engineering at Utah State University in Logan, Utah.

Besides Utah State, representatives from the University of Kansas and some
other institutions have reported similar problems.

So far, no corporations have reported any troubles with the popular new
operating system, according to a Microsoft spokesman. That suggests,
according to computer experts, that it is only in less regulated
environments -- such as college campuses -- where there may be problems. At
larger corporations, the computer network is closely managed by experts who
would know how to avoid the traps that could lead to the woes being
experienced at some universities.

The problem reported by the universities has to do with the inner workings
of Novell's Netware operating system. Under normal circumstances, when a
desktop computer running Novell's client software is turned on, one of the
first things that the computer does is send a request out on the network
for the nearest Novell server, said Doupnik. Under normal circumstances,
the nearest Netware server responds to this request and tells the client
computer how to go about accessing files on the organization's local area
network.

But when a Windows 95 computer configured to act like a server is attached
to the same network, Doupnik said that computer can respond first. The
result is that the person who has requested information from the network
ends up with an unresponsive, or dead, computer. For the user running a
computer with the Windows 95 operating system, nothing appears to be wrong.

Microsoft, meanwhile, denies that the problem exists.

''We have done extensive testing with Novell's products,'' said Mike Conte,
a group manager with Microsoft's Personal Systems Division. ''There was an
issue . . . during the beta [test period], but actually the problem has
been fixed for months.

''Normally, people won't encounter this issue at all, because it won't be
turned on,'' Conte said, referring to the program that turns on the
specific networking function. If users do turn it on, he said, they need to
specify a ''preferred network'' for Novell Netware clients to use. Windows
95 will then automatically send the client's requests to the appropriate
Netware server.

But computer system administrators -- and Novell itself -- disagree. Novell
and Microsoft are competitors in the lucrative networking software market.

William Donahoo, director of product marketing at Novell, said his company
has offered to work with Microsoft, but the Washington-based king of
desktop operating systems has rebuffed Novell's overtures.

''We have several license programs and computability testing programs,''
Donahoo said. ''They have not wanted to participate. They have wanted to do
it on their own.''

Donahoo said there is a way for system administrators to prevent system
crashes, but representatives from the universities say they have been
unable to resolve the problem.

For example, Michael McGinnis, a network consultant at the University of
Kansas in Lawrence, said a student at that university on Friday caused
havoc on the network system when he tried to hook up to the network after
he had installed Windows 95.

McGinnis said it took him and two other computer consultants three hours to
track down the culprit.

''I have had the problem, and I have gotten e-mail messages from system
administrators at three other universities who have seen the problem,''
McGinnis said.

McGinnis called Microsoft for technical support. ''I spent an hour on the
phone, and couldn't get to anyone at Microsoft who knew anything about this
problem. I talked to one tech support guy who said he didn't know of any
such problem. He gave me a phone number of another Windows 95 Networking
Support Group at Microsoft. I have not called them yet, because I didn't
have authorization to spend $35.''

About this last point, McGinnis is particularly resentful. ''We bought 375
copies and they won't let me talk to a tech support person unless I pay
them.''

       [This came from harry via a long chain of senders (Bostic, 
       Cate III, Olsen).  It seems worthy of RISKS in light of various
       recent developments.  PGN]
 
>From alt.folklore.computers

I heard this story from someone who worked for a French company, they had a
problem with a program on punched cards written for them by a US subsidiary.
The programs never worked when loaded in France but the US systems house
swore blind that they did at their end.  Eventually, in exasperation,
someone followed the working set of cards from the US to France.  At French
customs, they observed a customs official remove a few cards at random from
the deck.  Apparently, the french customs are entitled to remove a sample
from any bulk item (such as grain), so a few cards from a large consignment
shouldn't matter, should it?

[Later posts by Joe Morris and Tom Rauschenback confirmed the story.  Mr.
Morris said that the company was Oak Ridge National Labs, and the cards
contained unclassified data.  Mr. Rauschenback said that the story
originally came from him.  RMacN]

This was excerpted from alt.current-events.clinton.whitewater:

from The Washington Weekly (http://www.federal.com)

    It has come to my attention that several dissident sites on
the World Wide Web have been visited by White House computers
this week.  Apparently, all information regarding Whitewater,
Foster, and Mena has been transferred to White House computers.

    Specifically, the sites,

"Washington Weekly" (http://www.federal.com),
 "The Whitewater Scandal Home Page"
(http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~crow/whitewater/)
 "Whitewater & Vince Foster"
(http://www.cris.com/~dwheeler/n/whitewater/whitewater-index.html)

have been visited by White House computers ist1.eop.gov, ist6.eop.gov,
ist7.eop.gov, and gatekeeper.eop.gov between August 28 and August 31, and a
total of 128 files have been transferred to those White House computers. For
all sites, this constitutes a significant increase over previous access by
White House computers.

After receiving an erroneous error message about an address from

and (2) fix their mail transfer agent so problem reports are sent to the
REPLY-TO: or FROM: fields in preference to the SENDER: field they currently
erroneous use.

The following automatic response did not enhance my confidence in Compuserve

On BBC (British TV) I just heard a claim that the government logs all
international calls made. Not only the numbers called are stored, but also
the actual contents of conversations which were claimed to be stored for 90
days. There is an automatic keyword check that alerts a real human in case
of 'offensive words'.

I bet they were right thinking 'massive amounts of computer ...' were needed
for this.

It might be interesting to know what other countries do in this area, and
whether this is as true as I heard it or not.

Subject: Re: Initiative for better Usenet discussions (Meyers, RISKS-17.34) 

I read the article on SELF-DISCIPLINE.  While I agree with the basic thrust
of it, I feel that it is too organized and legalistic.  The kinds of things
that are addressed in this proposal need to be internalized; they need to be
second-nature.  I also would not be surprised to see news.discipline, if
created, become subject to endless wrangling about questions like whether
posting A is really following the rules or not.

On the other hand I like Tom Van Vleck's guidelines (cited at the end of
Bertrand Meyer's SELF-DISCIPLINE www page).  I think one way to internalize
good behavior is to read moralizing preachments like Van Vleck's over and
over.  Eventually some of it sinks in and BECOMES second-nature.

The basic problem, in my view, with Usenet news is that people have stopped
thinking of the person at the other end of the wire as a human being.  I
think it's the same (technologically induced) depersonalization we
experience behind the wheel of an auto.  The will to power takes over.

Most Microsoft programs *require* that one of the floppy disks be

among others, record the owner's name and company on one disk during
the first installation, and subsequent installations from the same set

Subject: Yet Another Bank Error

Apropos of Patrick Combs' $95,093.35 junk check follies, a bank in Chicago
reported a $520,000 deposit to the account of Glenn Turner's late mother.
He thought it was a mistake, checked with the bank, who reported it was not
an error.  After three weeks, he started spending it, racking up $189,000 in
expenditures.

Now a SECOND bank, the one that made the mistake, is suing him for the money
back.  His lawyer says that bank should be accountable; based on reading the
information Combs discovered on his odyssey, that appears to be likely.

The RISK is an old one: reliance on systems over common sense.  In this
case, since his mother had died, Mr. Turner might reasonably be able to
claim that he didn't know every detail of her finances and thus was able to
reasonably assume that, since the bank had verified the deposit, it was
legit.

P.S. to W.F. Linke: Have you read the information at the URL listed?  I
would have agreed with your distress until I did; assuming that Mr. Combs'
actions continue to back his words, his only evil (such as it is) seems to

Bill Linke said he thought the person who deposited this check was a thief
and should be treated as such.  While he has a point, the fact that Mr Combs
has not spent the money (as he reports) tempers my opinion of him as a thief
and makes me want to point a finger at the company that issued the 'check.'
IMO he did not pass a bad check - he deposited a check that "met all nine of
the legal criteria for a valid bearer document."  If that is not intent to
deceive (i.e. fraud) I don't know what is.  I think the company that issued
this check should be slammed for the 95k.  Then maybe the torrents of sleazy
junk mail I receive weekly would slow down.

Subject: Re: Bogus check for $95,000 (Linke, RISKS-17.34)

 > so, morally he is a thief, regardless of what a lawyer might make of it.

I have to disagree.  I believe that what Combs has done is a form of civil
disobedience, not against the government per se, but against a system which
clearly has flaws which need to be addressed, and which may very well be
addressed as a result of his actions.

In particular, if the check he deposited was in fact legally negotiable,
then the Federal check clearinghouse should not have rejected it (or, going
back further, the company that sent out the mass mailing should not have
sent out a negotiable check).  If the check was *not* negotiable, then that
should have been caught by Combs' bank or by the regional check
clearinghouse which allowed the check to clear.  Letting a $95,000 check of
questionable validity clear is not a minor problem, it's a *major* problem
(before disputing that, stop to think for a minute if you really think your
bank would catch it if a crooked cashier at the grocery store made a copy of
one of your checks and used the resulting information to forge another check
on your account for a large amount of money).  Without something like what
Combs did, I'm quite certain that the banks and check clearinghouses would
simply continue to ignore the problem for as long as they can.

A basic principle of civil disobedience is that those who engage in it
aren't supposed to profit from it.  So, you're right, it's not OK for Combs
to say, "Nyah, nyah, you missed the deadline, so I'm going to keep the
money!"  However, so far, that isn't what he has done.  He has kept the
cashier's check in a safe-deposit box, while trying to get people with
authority to acknowledge that the error occurred and do something to ensure
that the same error doesn't happen again.

Therefore, as long as the bank and/or the clearinghouse system refuse to
concede that they screwed up and to specify in detail what they've done to
prevent such screwups in the future, I think that Combs should leave that
check sitting in the safe-deposit box (except, of course, that he should
take it out, cash it, and put the money into a new cashier's check
periodically, so that the check doesn't expire).  Combs (and, more
generally, we the consumers) have no leverage on The System to force it to
fix itself, unless we can wield the threat of hitting it in the pocketbook,
and that's what Combs is doing.

Subject: Re: $95000 withdrawn from bank (Alan Wexelblat, RISKS-17.32)

Since he has the $95000 on a cashier's check that hasn't been cashed yet,
the bank still has the actual money.

The legal quirks are there to protect people from each other should one of
them try to defraud the other. That they also work in quite interesting
ways otherwise is another matter.

If I were he, I'd return the check -- IF the bank actually takes steps to
make sure this nonsense doesn't happen again. The info on his Web page says
he met with one of the Bank's lawyers a week ago and they reached some kind
of agreement (bank gets the check in return for complying with a list of
demands or whatever -- the Web page didn't specify). We'll see what happens
next. I've asked him via E-mail to clarify what these "ten things [he]
wanted" are. 

Anyway, and again IMHO, it's a Good Thing that this mistake actually hurts
the bank. That's a good way to improve the odds that it won't happen
again. (I was going to write "make sure" instead of "improve the odds" at
first, but common sense prevailed...)
