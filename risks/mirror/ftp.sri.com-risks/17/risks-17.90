Subject: Response from Strassmann/Marlow on remailers 

 [From Paul A. Strassmann, National Defense University 
 and William J. Marlow, SAIC, via Dorothy Denning]

We find that a report by a Mr. Viktor Mayer-Schoenberger [e.g., RISKS-17.87]
citing our alleged statements at a Harvard University Conference has been
widely quoted on Internet, out of context.

Specifically, he attributed to us statements that a number of anonymous
remailers in the US are run by government agencies and that the most popular
remailers in France and Germany are also run by government agencies.  What Mr.
Viktor Mayer-Schoenberger reported as facts are his interpretations.  Our
comments were of a general academic nature.  We were not attributing remailer
activities to any specific governments, but rather commenting on the general
situation where much of the research on the use of networks has been paid for
by governments and therefore one can assume that they would know how to make
use of such facilities.  We have no specific knowledge of any particular
agency of any government offering remailers services.  Whether or how they use
remailers is not known to us.  Online users just need to be "aware of the
risks."

Subject: University of California computerized retirement system flawed

A University of California computer system administers U.C.'s $20 billion
retirement program.  A recent report by Infortal Associates concludes that
the security of the system was very weak, and that the audit trails were
flimsy and easily disabled.  Furthermore, no one had responsibility for
reviewing the audit trails.  The system can be accessed from the Internet,
and Infortal was able to do so using a widely known password.  However, a
University spokesman observed that no adverse penetrations had actually
taken place, no money has been lost, and the security flaws have been fixed.
[Source: *San Francisco Chronicle*, 14 Mar 1996]

  [Well, in the absence of good audit trails, you may not know you have been
  penetrated.   Also, even if a few security flaws may have been fixed,
  such a system is never totally invulnerable to attack (whether on the
  Internet or not).  But you all know that by now?  PGN]

Subject: PGP - the next level...

 [This is from mini-AIR (e-mail synopsis of the Annals of Improbable Results).]

1996-03-05      PGP-Y Ill Advised

Reader Andrew Rock has been investigating our foolproof data security
protocol, PGP-Y (Pretty Good Parapsychology). He intuited this missive to us:

  "You were ill-advised to release the details of your PGP-Y -- "Pretty Good
  Parapsychology" protocol on an international mailing list such as mini_AIR.
  US law prohibits the export of such highly secure transmission technology,
  defining it as munitions. Your proposal must await government-approved key
  espcrow [sic] systems rumoured to be under consideration by the NSA. The
  approved systems will prohibit the possession or transmission of ideas
  beyond the imagination of government officers. Please do not carelessly put
  the publication of AIR at risk while I have nearly two years left on my
  subscription."

Investigator Trevor Green and a large team at the University of Saskatchewan
have also been laboring in the field. Green reports:

  "After an initial trial period of PGP-Y within our department, we have had
  some disappointing initial results. While the transmission rate is nothing
  short of paraphenomenal, the security mechanism is, alas, not wholly
  foolproof -- everything worked fine, until my friend Steve started imagining
  that he was intercepting the telepathically-transmitted data. We are sure
  that this technical loophole may be overcome but wish to alert your
  paranormal engineers to the oversight. Meanwhile, I am pleased to report
  that the credit-card fraud charges against Steve will be settled out of
  court."

From: ri-cook@uchicago.edu (Richard Cook)
Subject: Re: Possible future risk of virtual reality 

Recent discussion of appropriate renaming of v.r. systems prompts one to
note that being an attractive sink for funding often involves production of
a two-word nonsequitur comprising an adjective and a noun.  The
juxtaposition of the incompatible modifier with the noun yields a conflicted
notion that makes possible a degree of cognitive friction generating new
ideas, permits wild and unsubstantiated claims to flourish, and empowers
marketing hyperbole that has no equal.

Examples include not only "virtual reality" but also "artificial intelligence"
and "expert systems".  In each, the combination is unlikely to the same
degree as a zen koan.  Although the metaphor may be a little overextended, 
proponents seem to regard contemplation of the terms as one means of
achieving the experience of satori.

While the clever use of language is required to initiate funding flows, it
is generally unable to sustain it for more than about a decade.  Skilled
operators are able to generate a new term-pair every decade or so to ensure
continued flow of funds for research and development.

Subject: Re: Denormalising databases (Teen convicted, Jewell, RISKS-17.87)
 
I agree that denormalise database design may be better, but not for the same
reasons Phil suggests.  What Phil has described is an example of poor coding
and understanding of relational design rather than a case for
denormalisation.  The use of a unique key that refers to the product number
(and name) would overcome this problem.
 
The RISK here is confusing the theory with the (bad) practice.

Subject: Hyphenation in names

Our school has some servers that run Solaris and some that run SunOS.  I
discovered that when I posted to USENET on the Solaris machines, my name
showed up as "-Hwa Huang" instead of "Wei-Hwa Huang".  After we traced down
the problem recently, it turned out that inews on the Solaris machines
assumed that the names in the passwd file looked like

  foo-John Smith(bar)

where foo and bar are used to mean stuff that doesn't concern the user's name.
On the other hand, inews on SunOS used

  John Smith,foo,bar

instead.  Obviously, the Solaris machines saw

  foo-Wei-Hwa Huang(bar)

and got confused.

The RISKS are obvious.  Whomever compiled inews on the Solaris machines made
the assumption that the hyphen was a safe delimiter that would never appear
in a user's name.  Of course, with the SunOS method, names with commas in
them would confuse the system instead.  If there are people out there with
strange names, or perhaps use 2-byte characters, these "standard" systems
wouldn't fare too well.  On the other hand, while using something strange
such as $ for a delimiter would work in more cases, it certainly makes for
difficult reading of the source.  What's a designer to do?

Kudos to my excellent sysadmins for pinpointing and fixing the problem so
rapidly, by the way.

Subject: Domain Name translation at ISP = Wrong Address

I recently changed ISPs and suddenly mail from one individual I correspond
with had a change in her address, so that my replies to her messages were
coming back with the User Unknown response.  Since I also obtain her
postings at a second ISP, I checked and found that her address was still the
original address at the second ISP.

[Incidentally, my mailer automatically uses the reply-to address if supplied,
or falls back to using the from address.  In this case, the "From:" address
was being used, and was being changed at *my* ISP when it was received,
whether in a Usenet message or a personal e-mail message.]

Having discovered this, I called the new ISP's technical support group and
explained my discovery.  While laughing, the support person tested my
contention internally on their system and discovered that, lo and behold, I
was correct in my theory.  For some reason, the @ns.net was being translated
to @norm.net by their system.  They name each of their machines, and one had
been named "norm".  For some reason, they had, somewhere in their system, a
conversion where ns=norm.  While this may have been required for some
purpose, it was being applied for a different purpose, totally unintended.
[Whether they could have discovered this via testing is unknown to me.]

It took two days, but they HAVE fixed the problem - without letting me know
when they had it fixed, and without letting me know exactly where the
problem occurred.

The risk is obvious, if you only have one ISP...  When mail is returned as
undeliverable, it may be that the address is incorrect because of something
your ISP has done and is totally unaware of. Believe me, this CAN result in
annoyance and frustration, both on your part and on the part of the person
you correspond with, half way around the world.  Fortunately we were not
involved in any correspondence where time was of the essence, or the problem
would have been far worse.

Subject: More e-mail address problems

The message from Bob Heuman reminds your moderator that I have been itching
to grumble again about the ongoing RISKS bouncemail problems -- along the
lines of Phil Agre's posting on the risks of e-mail (Bouncemail Top 10) in
RISKS-16.76.  In the past week alone, I have had at least 20 new subscribers
using the majordomo listserv whose "From:" address or other explicitly
provided address was not a valid address, so that they could not receive
mail at their own given addresses!  This is truly ridiculous, although it
may be attributed to the rapid growth of the Internet community among folks
not used to the subtleties of life on the net.  I sometimes get as many as
100 bounces a day; even if I have just pruned away all the previous hard
bounces, I still get a bunch of *new* ones on the next issue.  The good news
is that the Internet is dynamic.  The bad news is that the Internet is
dynamic.

If you do not get RISKS for a long while, you should check the archives to
see whether you have been dropped from the list because of prolonged bounces
(or whether I have just been otherwise occupied).

Subject: Re: Risks of automatically publishing to the Web! (Junt, RISKS-17.89)

	The first risk is that of including `live' code fragments in a
	publication, especially one which is subject to several media.

	The second risk is that of using an automated process to construct
	and publish information on the Web -- especially if the input to
	that process is e-mail.

Just to expand on the above: ``Live code'' can stealthly come into
documents.  Any web site that offers to take online "feedback" or "comments"
has an open invitation to such trojan codes -- for example, an attacker can
simply type in applet code into an online form.

Moreover, it is perhaps more convenient to collect and sort these feedback
automatically and then view them through a web browser (instead of an editor
such as Emacs or MS Wordpad).  Thus, the risk is often there if one uses a
java-capable browser to do something useful.

On the other hand, there is the tendency that a newly discovered attack will
quickly lead to a patch that disables a useful feature in the browser or
interpreter.  Soon the features list is shortened to almost zero and ones
starts to ask why the language is needed at all.

From: brian@piglet.cam.cornell.edu (Brian Kelley)
Subject: Netscape White pages "Who Where?" risks

A mate of mine, whom I will call Skip and his computer ralph.nomame.edu, 
decided to look himself up on the "Who Where?" database.
He found his name, selected it, and was rewarded with the response:

* Name: ??? Console
E-mail: skip@ralph.nomame.edu
Organization: cornell university, ithaca
Last Updated: --

This is all fine and good, except that a) he never registered himself with
the server and b) ralph.noname.edu is not a mail server and all mail there 
will bounce.  So the question is, how did this E-mail address show up?  So, 
I looked at my entry.

* Name: Brian Kelley
E-mail: brian@piglet.cam.cornell.edu
Organization: cornell university, ithaca
Last Updated: --

Now, piglet.cam.cornell.edu is also not my e-mail address.

We did a little digging and discovered that the standard unix command 
"finger @ralph.noname.edu" responded with 

[ralph.noname.edu]
Login	Name	TTY	Idle	When	Where
skip       ???  console 10:30  Tue 22:22

and "finger @piglet.cam.cornell.edu" responds with

[piglet.cam.cornell.edu]
  User     Real Name         What    Idle  TTY  Host      Console Location
brian    Brian Kelley                        4 piglet   357 Theory Center

So, our assumption is, which is also a risk in itself, that some program
is fingering computers and "grep"ing the return info which, in the case
of skip is incorrect.

However, the real question is, how did these machines get registered with
the page?  The answer is, Netscape.  My best guess is that by selecting the 
"Who Where?" page, or some other page, automatically registers your machine 
with the database which then fingers your machine for information.  To
test this theory, just look up the entries for "root."  (Which indicates
many more risks, i.e. root running Netscape, et. al.)

This would be fine if there was a notice that entering this page
automatically registers you (and everyone currently logged onto your
computers) with the database.  However, the page highlights and underlines
the phrase "Add Your Listing" which indicates that it has not been added
already.

The risks, in the case of skip, are obvious.  However, it was just another
reminder to myself about the propagation of personal information (that
may indeed be inaccurate.)

Subject: How I lost my Y2K innocence

A brief note of appreciation to Bear Giles (RISKS-17.89):

I had been focussed on Y2K as a technical problem.  At the risk of showing
my age, here's how I lost my innocence.

Our timesharing mainframe's OS failed on December 1, 1979.  Operations was
able to restart it; it would run a short while and fail again in the
supervisor. I won't mention the OS since we had extensively modified it and
it wouldn't be fair to sully the vendor with our self produced problem.

The memory dump showed a data exception in our online accounting routine, it
was doing a packed decimal operation on a field that contained the
hexadecimal sequence '000197AF'.  You grey beards (Yes, I have seen *you*,
Mr. Moderator.) out there will recognize the problem.  Even though the field
had the century indicator, our assembly language programmer had chosen to
increment only the year portion.  He extracted the 4 bits, incremented the
year, and stored the year back.  This subroutine worked for years 1970
through 1979 but 197A is not the next year, at least not until we replace
decades with hexadecades.

(sidebar ALC lesson, of '000197AF', the 'F' means a positive number.  This
representation is packed decimal; the programmer used binary arithmetic
operators on a packed decimal number.)

This code calculated the billing period, lived in our operating system, and
was executed at the end of each batch job or timesharing logoff.

A lot of the popular writing on the Y2K problem (I'd been calling it, the
century end problem) has focussed on application data, cobol, database,
accounting, and reporting issues.  These are certainly the larger part of
the problem and the 'suit' consulting companies will have their hands full.

Because I have seen and debugged an operating system catastrophic failure
caused by a calendar issue, I believe this problem has a darker, more
ominous side.  There are subtle Y2K problems that are not revealed by
scanning the external data.  Some of these problems are implemented in
assembly language.  Some of the assembly language source code has been lost
over the decades.  There are very few of us left who can read and write
machine language.

Contrary to reports in the popular press, the world does not run on PCs and
client/server systems.  It runs on big water cooled mainframes and a lot of
old, old software maintained by aging staffs.  Each year, a substantial
percentage of the machine language programmers leave this business.

Who is going to fix the hard problems?

Subject: Re: Leap-years and leap-seconds (Dellinger, Risks-17.86)

> A leap second is a 61st second in a minute (always just before UT
> midnight), so ... some date specifications such as "23:59:60 Dec 31
> 1972" are actually perfectly valid.

Yep -- but that particular date and time combination is valid only if the
time zone is assumed to be UTC.  In the Newfoundland time zone, for example,
23:59:60 would never be a valid time, but on days with a leap second, one of
20:29:60 or 21:29:60 is valid.  22:29:60 could have been valid too if there
had been a leap second in the summer of 1988 when Newfoundland tried double
daylight saving time, but there wasn't one then.  In other words, true
validation of a time of day requires knowledge of the time zone.

Of course, this is true anyway even without regard to leap seconds, since
you also need to know about daylight saving time transitions.

Which reminds me of something instructive -- a few weeks ago, Dafydd Price
Jones (dafyddpj@dafyddpj.demon.co.uk) asked in rec.puzzles: "What was the
longest month of 1995 in New York?"  The right answer is October, when
daylight saving time ends.  But there must have been half a dozen readers
who forgot that, remembered the latest leap second, and leaped to post the
wrong answer "December".

The moral?  Merely what we've been saying already.  Date and time
computations are surprisingly tricky.

(There was also a wonderful "cook" of the puzzle, with its own Risks
implications.  Chris Best (cab@col.hp.com) said that the longest month
was the only 9-letter one, September!  Peter will remember the time that
comp.risks itself was bitten by a longer-than-average spelled-out date.)

Joe continues:

| This has worked reasonably well so far, but I've read predictions
| that within only a couple of decades we'll first start needing leap
| seconds every year, then twice a year, then even more and more often...
| What shall we do then?  Redefine the second?  Keep two separate time
| standards, one with a fixed second and another with a stretchy second
| that changes to accommodate the Earth?

Already done -- those would be TAI and UT1 respectively.  Neither one is
what's used for civil time, though.  Civil time is based on UTC, which is
called *Coordinated* Universal Time precisely because it is derived from
*both* TAI and UT1.  And this is exactly why we have leap seconds.  UTC uses
the fixed-size seconds of TAI, but keeps its time within 900 ms of the
current time according to UT1, by using a leap second (or, as Joe noted, in
theory an anti-leap second) when needed.

But maybe Joe meant that people would actually need to use both kinds of
seconds in everyday life.  It'll be a *long* time before things come to
that, and I think we can safely defer the problem for now.

Incidentally, while TAI is an acronym in French, UTC is not; it's in
English, but the C is last because it's effectively a subscript.  Both UT1
and UTC are considered variations of UT, Universal Time; there are others too.

obtained by e-mail from me.

The for those who don't want to browse through 500-odd lines to find it,
the key part of the Act that defines the leap year pattern decrees:

#  That the several Years of our Lord, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300, or
#  any other hundredth Years of our Lord, which shall happen in Time to

except that in the actual Act, all of the numbers are written out in words.

Pope Gregory's original proclamation would also be of interest, but I presume
it was in Latin; anyway, I've never seen a copy of it.
