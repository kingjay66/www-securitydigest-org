Subject: SpaceCom technician disables pagers massively

A SpaceCom technician at their uplink facility in Tulsa, Oklahoma
accidentally send out a spacey command shutting down the satellite receivers
used by pager systems throughout the country, affecting millions of pagers.
SpaceCom supports 5 of the largest 10 paging outfits.  This happened at 1
a.m. yesterday, and each receiver had to be manually reprogrammed -- which
took all day until most of the service could be restored.  Al Stem, VP and
GM of SC said, "This hasn't ever happened before.  And we're putting
additional systems in place to make sure it never happens again."  [Source:

Subject: Fault-Tolerant Computer System Survives Heat Wave

I recently received the following story from one of our customer engineers.
I am submitting it to the Risks Forum as a "good news" story.  Here is a
case were the system worked as designed (indeed, may have exceeded its
design limits) and saved a customer from a serious outage.  I have omitted
the name and location of the customer for obvious reasons.
     
This Stratus system manages a robotically-automated repair parts depot for
a major US railroad.  If the system is down equipment cannot be repaired.

     On Friday, July 14, 1995 at approximately 6:00 pm, the computer room
     air conditioning unit at the Maintenance Facility of the Railroad
     registered an over-temperature condition.  This alarm is set to trip
     at 80 degrees F.  The computer room is generally unmanned at this time
     so there were no operators or any other personnel onsite to receive
     the alarm.  This information has been extracted from the alarm logs
     and has been confirmed.  The a/c compressor was failing and now the
     fans were circulating the same air and the temperature was rising
     steadily.
     
     At Friday at 20:44:57 EDT the Railroad's Stratus system telephoned a
     failure notification to the Stratus Customer Assistance Center (CAC)
     in Marlboro reporting that the CPU in slot 30 had failed and had been
     removed from service.  This failure may have been caused by the
     increased temperature.
     
     On Sunday at 12:58:00 EDT the system reported a second problem:  a
     D604 disk drive had failed and had been removed from service, possibly
     as a result of the increased temperature.  The system had been
     operating in a over-temperature condition now for 42 hours.
     
     During this time the Stratus CAC personnel had been trying to bring
     the system back to normal and were attempting to contact the Railroad.
     The Railroad personnel could not be reached.
     
     The CE for the site was aware of the problem Sunday evening having
     been notified by the Stratus e-mail system.  At 7:00 am Monday the CE
     arrived at the Stratus office and attempted to contact the Railroad.
     The customer returned the call at 9:00 am.  The CE advised the
     customer that he would be on-site shortly to restore the system to
     normal.
     
     The parts, a CPU and a D604, were already onsite when the CE arrived.
     The D604 was from a previous call not related to this problem.  The
     computer room was still 110 degrees when the CE arrived onsite.  This
     was 10 degrees cooler from the time the customer arrived.  He managed
     this reduction by using desktop fan units from offices of Railroad
     employees.  The Stratus module was operating with users even when
     several other Railroad computers, including two systems from a
     different vendor, had failed.  Further complicating the Railroad's
     problems was the fact that the other vendor did not have any personnel
     on-site and no phone support was evident.
     
     The CE replaced the failed CPU in slot 30.  Two drives were out of
     service.  One drive was setup and recovered and is still fully
     operational, and one was replaced and recovered.  Both the CPU and
     disk drive repairs were performed with the application online.  During
     the entire time from 6:00 pm Friday to 9:00 am Monday, 63 hours, the
     Stratus System performed in a environment which had reached
     temperatures of 120 degrees and functioned without interrruption.  The
     system was fully duplexed in less than one hour.  The two Brand X
     systems which had shutdown completely were restored by 2:15 pm by the
     customer.  He did not have the assistance of Brand X personnel either
     onsite or by phone.

Stratus systems are designed to work at temperatures from 10 to 40 degrees
Celsius environment (50 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), with humidity from 20 to
80% noncondensing.  We actually test them from 0 to 40 degrees C.  For our
Telephone "Central Office" models, we specify and test up to 50 degrees C --
122 degrees F.  The CO models are not significantly different from the
non-CO models.  The specification relates to the ambient temperature of the
room; it is not unusual for internal temperatures within the cabinet to be
20 to 30 degrees C higher.  The locations that run at this higher
temperature are designed to withstand it.

Unlike the other brand of equipment that this customer was using, we elect
to keep running, rather than shutdown, because we are aiming for continuous
availability.  In other words, we are trade off reduced equipment lifetimes
for higher levels of availability.  We're betting that, as in this case, a
few failures won't bring down the entire system and that the overall
situation can be discovered and repaired in time to prevent an application
outage.

Thus, I believe that our design and testing standards carried us thru this
heat wave, not luck or accident.

From: David Olsen <olsen@Rational.COM>
Subject: Vote by mail

New methods of voting designed to replace the traditional polling place 
and ballot box are a regular topic of discussion on RISKS.  The method 
being discussed usually involves voting by phone or by computer.  The 
state of Oregon is experimenting with a new voting method, but is using 
a technology that may be older that the voting booth itself: the mail.

Sen. Packwood's replacement, to be elected on January 30, will be the 
first member of the U.S. Congress ever elected in an all-mail election. 
Ballots will be mailed out to all registered voters a few weeks before 
the election date.  Voters fill out the ballots in their own home at 
their leisure.  They can then either send them back through the mail, 
or take them in person to a designated drop-off point.  All completed 
ballots must arrive by January 30.

Oregon has used all-mail elections before for local elections, with pretty
good success.  But this will be the first time it has been tried in a
state-wide election.  No one claims to fully understand the risks involved,
so people will be watching this election very carefully.  Election officials
like all-mail elections because they don't have to set up any polling places
or find people to run them.  Most think that voter participation, long a
problem in the United States, will increase.  The potential for fraud is
greater, but most officials seem to have enough faith in the general public
that they are not worrying about it very much.  The timing of campaigns will
definitely change.  Any last-minute media blitz is useless because most
people will have already voted.

If you do this on a Macintosh (Excel v5.0a on a PowerMac 8100/110) you get
a result of 1.40737488355328 = 1.28, proving that the Macintosh is 6 times
more accurate than Windows machines.

The (non-Microsoft) Macintosh calculator desk accessory does not have
this problem.

Subject: Re: Identifying Numbers and E-mail (Parnas, RISKS-17.36)

McMaster's use of student numbers in email is indeed odd (not to mention 
making it very difficult to remember undergrad email addresses!)

Is it even legal?  I was under the impression that, under Canada's access 
to information and privacy laws, the open publication of university 
student numbers (i.e. providing grades on office doors) is not allowed, 
but is continued simply due to the fact that there has been little 
resistance to this long-standing practice.  

If it is not illegal, perhaps it should be: posting a printed list on a
professor's door is one thing; having it correlated electronically to one's
name is another issue entirely.

Subject: Re: Abandoned oil tank phones... (Reifschneider, RISKS-17.36)

The woman being haunted by the mystery calls lives near me.  The local
newspaper had a much more thorough coverage of the story. Here are the
facts:

The "oil tank" was a home heating oil tank in a private residence.  It
was not a million-gallon monster owned by an oil company.

The tank had an auto-dialer attached, and was programmed to call the
heating oil service company when the oil level fell.  They would then
dispatch a truck to top the tank off.

Years ago the heating oil service company went out of business.  The
phone company reclaimed the 800-service telephone number that the
auto-dialers used. (Do you see where this is going?)

The 800 number was assigned to a _business_ in Massachusetts.  It was
set up for nation-wide availability, and connected to a FAX machine.  The
business is quite small, and is run by its owner from her home office.

An electrical storm happened in Maryland.  Apparently a nearby strike
somehow woke up the auto-dialer.  The business in Massachusetts starts
to get late night "hang-up" calls.

The calls were finally traced.  The retiree that owned the tank knew
nothing about the auto-dialer, and said she was very sorry that her oil
tank was making crank calls.

The real risk seems to be assuming that the public news organizations
understand anything technological.  A secondary risk, as Sean pointed
out, is that no one was responsible for making sure that _all_ the
auto-dialers were disconnected, when the oil company went bankrupt.  I
wonder how many more of them, still programmed to that 800-number, are
still waiting for their "wakeup" call?

Subject: CERT Summary CS-95:02

      [The CERT bulletins are generally too long and too frequent to 
      include in RISKS.  However, they represent a valuable collection
      of information regarding vulnerabilities (albeit primarily those 
      for which fixes are known).   This is a metamessage that may be

CERT Summary CS-95:02
September 26, 1995

The CERT Coordination Center periodically issues the CERT Summary to draw
attention to the types of attacks currently being reported to our incident
response staff. The summary includes pointers to sources of information for
dealing with the problems. Starting with this summary, we will also list new
or updated files that are available for anonymous FTP from ftp://info.cert.org

Past CERT Summaries are available from 
     ftp://info.cert.org/pub/cert_summaries
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recent Activity
---------------
Since the July CERT Summary, we have seen these continuing trends in incidents
reported to us:

1. Sendmail Attacks

We receive several reports each week of attacks through sendmail, with
intruders using a variety of techniques. Most of the attacks are aimed at
gaining privileged access to the victim machine.

To combat these threats, we encourage sites to take the appropriate steps
outlined in the following:

  ftp://info.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/CA-95:11.sun.sendmail-oR.vul
  ftp://info.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/CA-95:11.README

  ftp://info.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/CA-95:08.sendmail.v.5.vulnerability
  ftp://info.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/CA-95:08.README

A number of sites have reported some confusion on the need to continue using
the sendmail restricted shell program (smrsh). You need to run the smrsh tool
in conjunction with the most recently patched version of sendmail for your
system.

Information on the smrsh tool can be obtained from these places in
  ftp://info.cert.org/pub/

                   tools/sendmail/smrsh/
                   cert_advisories/CA-93:16.sendmail.vulnerability
                   cert_advisories/CA-93:16a.sendmail.vulnerability.supplement
                   cert_advisories/CA-93:16a.README
                   cert_advisories/CA-95:11.sun.sendmail-oR.vul
                   cert_advisories/CA-95:11.README

The smrsh program can be obtained from

  ftp://info.cert.org/pub/tools/smrsh/

It is included in the sendmail 8.7 distribution.


2. Network Scanning

Several incidents have recently been reported in which intruders scan a large
address range using the Internet Security Scanner (ISS). As described in CERT
advisory CA-93:14, this tool interrogates all computers within a specified IP
address range, determining the security posture of each with respect to
several common system vulnerabilities.

Intruders have used the information gathered from these scans to compromise
sites. We are aware of many systems that have suffered a root compromise as a
result of information intruders obtained from ISS scans.

You may wish to run ISS against your own site in accordance with your
organization's policies and procedures. ISS is available from

  ftp://info.cert.org/pub/tools/iss/iss13.tar

We encourage you to take relevant steps outlined in these documents:

  ftp://info.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/CA-93:14.Internet.Security.Scanner
  ftp://info.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/CA-93:14.README
  ftp://info.cert.org/pub/tech_tips/security_info
  ftp://info.cert.org/pub/tech_tips/packet_filtering


3. Exploitation of rlogin and rsh

We have received some reports about the continued exploitation of a
vulnerability in rlogin and rsh affecting IBM AIX 3 systems and Linux systems.
This is not a new vulnerability, but it continues to exist. Sites have
reported encountering some Linux distributions that contain this
vulnerability.

Information on this vulnerability and available solutions can be
obtained from

  ftp://info.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/CA-94:09.bin.login.vulnerability
  ftp://info.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/CA-94:09.README


4. Packet Sniffers

We continue to receive new incident reports daily about sniffers on
compromised hosts. These sniffers, used to collect account names and
passwords, are frequently installed using a kit. In some cases, the packet
sniffer was found to have been running for months. Occasionally, sites had
been explicitly warned of the possibility of such a compromise, but the
sniffer activity continued because the site did not address the problem in the
comprehensive manner that we suggest in our security documents.

Further information on packet sniffers is available from

  ftp://info.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/CA-94:01.network.monitoring.attacks
  ftp://info.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/CA-94:01.README

Information about detecting sniffers using cpm is in the CA-94:01.README
file.
