Subject: New Massachusetts password law invoked on hospital technician

Mark L. Farley, 34, of Lowell, was arrested on 9 Apr 1995.  Working as an
orthopedic technician in the Newton-Wellesley Hospital, he allegedly
accessed a former employee's computer account to search through 954
confidential files of patients (mostly young females) for telephone numbers,
which he then used to make obscene calls.  (He had pleaded guilty in 1984 to
raping an eight-year-old girl in Erving.)  He is apparently the first person
to be charged under a new Massachusetts statute that makes it a criminal
offense to use someone else's password to gain access to a computer system.
He is also accused of stealing hospital trade secrets, and making obscene or
annoying telephone calls -- apparently from the hospital.  [Source: Hospital
Worker Charged under New Massachusetts Password Law By MATTHEW BRELIS, *The
Boston Globe*, 12 Apr 1995.]

Subject: Less than robust wiring designs

I just received this peach from a friend at a local multi-million dollar
computer company (after their phone was busy all day).  They recently had
some layoffs, but frankly it sounds like their problems started long before
that:

> My phone isn't really busy.  There's a little problem at ******* today.

> got left with the layoff.

The Risks of not having detailed instructions for disaster recovery are
apparent.  The question of why a lab is sharing power with the main phone
system is a sub-Risk left for the student.

While I'm at it, just why would you design an earthquake detection system
that didn't require two or more significantly separated points for
verification?  Local shocks from people dropping heavy objects are
relatively common...

Subject: Fugue-by-Wire!?

You've heard of Fly-by-Wire? well what about Fugue-By-Wire! The UK New
Scientist magazine, 15 April 1995, reports that Notre Dame's organ is not
suitable for concerts following a two year restoration costing =A31.3
million (Pounds Sterling) in which six computers were installed to relay the
organist's instructions from the manuals (keyboards) and pedals to the organ
pipes.  The cathedral's administrator has cancelled all concerts as a series
of malfunctions, including `memory failure', has caused the organ (as he is
reported as saying) `to suddenly stop working. It takes five to ten minutes
to get it going again. This is too stressful for the organists who never
know when it will happen'! It is still used for Mass, however, as when it
`crashes' a small organ fills in the unintented silence.  JS Bach should
have been warned that his `Toccata & Fugue in D Minor' would be too `memory
intensive' for organs of the future!

Eleven Electronic Bulletin Board Systems Dismantled
(From A Royal Canadian Mounted Police news release)

Montreal, April 12, 1995 - Seventeen searches conducted in the Greater 
Montreal area by the Copyright Investigations Unit of the Montreal RCMP 
Federal Enforcement Section put an end to the operation of eleven 
electronic bulletin board systems (BBS).

Since 6 o'clock this morning, 75 RCMP members have been dismantling bulletin
boards specialized in circulating copyrighted Canadian software such as Le
Correcteur 101, CorelDraw, Winfax PRO, as well as products developed by
Audodes [Autodesk?], Borland, Clark Development, DataStorm, Disney, IBM,
Lotus, Microsoft, Windows 95, Mustang Software, Novell, Playboy,
Quarterdeck, Sierra, Symantec and many other firms.

Computers and peripherals worth more than one hundred thousand dollars were
seized, along with millions of dollars of pirated software.

This is the most important operation of this kind yet in Canada against 
illicit bulletin board systems.

About 15 persons will appear in court at a later date to face charges 
under the Copyright Act which sets out severe penalties for offenders:
-	6 months and/or $25,000.00 per count for summary conviction 
	offenses;
-	2 years and/or $1,000,000.00 per count for indictable offenses.

_La Presse_, the largest newspaper in the greater Montreal area, published a
news story about the raids on 13 Apr 1995 (translation and summary by MK):

	Major Strike by the RCMP in the InfoBahn
	[Gros coup de la GRC dans l'inforoute]

	by Eric Trottier, La Presse

	The RCMP has decided to do a little house-cleaning in the
	joyously anarchic world of the electronic highway.

	Thanks to a computer-science infiltration operation, the 
	federal police yesterday dismantled 11 bulletin boards that
	were trafficking in tens of thousands of software packages
	around the world.

	"It's the first time we have been able to implement this type
	of penetration of BBSs.  Even in the U.S., the most important
	dragnet of this type has so far only allowed the dismantling of
	six BBSs at a time," said Sergeant Serge Corriveau to La Presse
	shortly after the investigators completed more than a dozen
	penetrations and seized more than C$200,000 [U$140,000] of
	computer equipment.

Key points from the article:

o	News of the raid spread rapidly through the Internet;

o	The 11 BBSs were involved in large-scale fraud in N.America 
	and Europe.  Subscription fees of C$30-C$50 per month allowed
	participants to download copies of proprietary software at will.

o	"Everything available legally on the market was offered by these
	BBSs," said Sgt Corriveau.

o	Some of the more audacious BBSs offered beta copies of Windows95.

o	There are about 700 BBSs in the greater Montreal area; the RCMP
	estimate that three-quarters of them traffic in stolen software.

o	Some of the BBS have become virtual flea markets of pornography,
	bomb-making instructions, and details of how to succeed at suicide.

o	In one of the shut-down systems, stolen goods and illegal assault
	weapons were advertised for sale.

o	It has taken a year to infiltrate the BBSs; some officers had to 
	wait up to four months to gain entrance to the inner areas of the
	boards they were investigating.

o	The raids involved 75 officers in Montreal, Outremont, Repentigny,
	Longueuil, Saint-Amable, and the St-Jerome area.

o	The BBSs shut down are:  Notice, Twins, Red Alert, Perfect Crime,
	Beyond Corruption, Line-Up, Wolf Pack, On the World, Restricted Area
	and Necromancer Mecon.

o	Most had about 6 telephone lines for full-time access, serving 
	100-250 clients, with some in Europe.  The larges, Notice, had 
	350 clients who each paid $50/month, for an untaxed revenue of 
	C$210,000 per year.

o	The police estimate that 11 to 15 criminal hackers will be 
	indicted as a result of the raids.  They each face fines of
	C$25,000 to C$100,000.

Of course not. Everyone would have switched to Win 95 by then...

Maybe there is a RISK here. Suppose a software developer finds problems in
some current version of a program, but instead of sending out an immediate
bug-fix (with all its attendant negative publicity), elects to wait until
the next major version release before including the fixes. If this release
is then delayed, are users then left using broken software for longer than
is necessary?

>Could it be that the visual and mental concentration required to

>for a police officer?

Depends on the situation.  It would be foolish to begin using the computer
when you knew you were in a tactical situation that demanded keen awareness
of your surroundings.  However, a cop who spent his entire shift worrying
about being ambushed by someone with a high-powered rifle would, I should
imagine, have a brief, ineffective, possibly even dangerous career en route
to a psych disability.

But perhaps there is a risk, related to the way a computer sucks your
attention into a black hole where space and time have little meaning.  A cop
who pulls over into some secluded area to finish up his paperwork might well
face a less absorbing task that lets him monitor what's going on outside the
car.

There's a RISK much more probable than getting ambushed, though.  I became
aware of it while watching "Cops" on the bread-and-circuses dispenser one
night. Our hero was driving along a city street at a pretty good clip while
in a complete heads-down mode, using the computer.  Had there been a bicycle
or baby buggy in front of the car, the screeching noise from underneath the
axle would've been his first clue that something was wrong.

Subject: RE: RISKS of patrol-car computers (Story, RISKS-17.06)

The story relating to the murder of an Oakland Cop, who was slain while
using in car-computer, brings another "interesting" RISK to mind.

Since the cop was murdered while using the computer, it is safe to assume
that the cop was properly signed into the system, when he died.  The
criminal could have used the computer to access police files, perhaps alter
them, or otherwise infiltrate the system and violate the integrity of the
computer system.

Subject: "Friendly" user interfaces [ Was: Re: Searching for a book... ]

In response to Erik Kraft's message about the lack of power inherent to many
"user friendly" interfaces:

This sort of thing happens quite frequently; it's one of the reasons why I
won't touch Window & Mac machines, while I love UNIX.  The typical problem
is that it's much easier to implement a "computerese" interface (which
requires little design) than to design & implement a worthwhile
user-friendly interface *that has the same flexibility*.

The risks?  Building software upon software that doesn't allow complete
flexibility!  Eventually *something* is going to break, and if low-level and
flexible configuration/command ability isn't available, the only person
who's going to be able to fix it will be the original programmer.

Perhaps some advice: build the graphics interface to critical utilities on
TOP of a flexible command-line system, not concurrent with it.

[obRisks: since I don't deal with inflexible user interfaces any more, I don't
 have any recent examples of this sort of thing.  The most relevant one I
 can think of is the (old?) NeXTStep graphical system manager interface.
 Once I deleted the NetInfo database, and (after browsing the manual pages
 in single user mode for several hours) had to reinstall the entire system.
 It's virtually impossible to change the system using the command-line
 utilities. ]

Subject: Re: Searching for a book in a database (Kraft, RISKS-17.06)

Erik Kraft responds to my comment about the advantage of "human search" of
available computer search techniques in finding a book in a library listing
by describing a similar problem he had, which he was able to solve by talking
to a friend at the computer center and gaining access to the "computerese"
interface.

Curiously, when I first described my problem to a friend who uses the same
library, he pointed out that the programs involved provided two interfaces:
The "easy to use" hierarchical menu system meant for customers, and the
higher-powered system meant for librarians.  The particular search I needed
could, indeed, have been done fairly easily from a librarian's terminal.

But this illustrates another aspect of the same risk.  Most people don't have
friends at the computer center, or even know librarians who will let them use
the "privileged" interface.  The only interface available to them is the
"public" interface, which in the interest of ease-of-use by a population who
have no reason, time, or desire to "learn about this fancy computer stuff",
has been deliberately limited in its capabilities.

I recall a discussion I had a number of years back with Alan Perlis.  (Alan
was a wonderful person with a very broad range of interest and insights, so
this isn't as odd as it will sound.)  I had just been trying to buy a wood
trash can.  I couldn't find any - just cheap metal and cheap molded plastic
"fake wood".  I commented that technological advances sometimes lowered the
quality of the products one could find.  Alan's response was that, no, I was
looking at it wrong.  Pre-technology, most people could only afford to buy
low-quality versions of a product; the reasonably well off could buy
higher-quality versions.  Technology - particularly automation - made it
possible to raise the quality of the cheap stuff.  This eliminated both the
older forms of the product: The real junk was no cheaper to produce than the
better post-technology product so couldn't compete; and the former
"reasonable quality" was now much more expensive, and only a bit better.
Often, a new "super-high-quality" stratum came into being as well - where
"quality" often really means "snob appeal" - but at much, much higher
prices.  (Sometimes this already existed and simply continued; sometimes
not).  For the relatively less well off, technology provides better products
for equal or less cost.  For the very well off, it makes little difference.
But there is a range in the middle who actually lose ground.

We are seeing a similar effect in these library interfaces.  For the vast
majority of people, who rarely use the library systems and have no need to
do anything sophisticated when they *do* use them, they are a clear step
forward.  Those people who are "wealthy" by virtue of having special access
and knowledge at worst break even, and often gain.  But there are those in
the middle for whom the new technologies are a step backward.  Library
systems are not alone - those of us who, for example, are used to writing
command files or shell scripts to accomplish sophisticated things find GUI
interfaces frustrating.  More and more systems are "sealed" - at least Mr.
Kraft's friend in the library computer center could give him access to a
low-level interface.  What happens when the only access is through a Web
server that no one can log onto?  You get the services it chooses to give
you, period.

Subject: Risks of online documentation

I've long been a bit disturbed by the trend toward distributing software
without documentation, instead referring the user to online documentation at
a WWW site.  Here is an example of how this arrangement can go wrong:

Note that there is a mirror of the NCSA documentation at
http://www.vtls.com/docs/, but it is not clear that either VTLS or NCSA
have made a commitment to keep the mirror up to date (nothing at the
VTLS site mentions version httpd_1.3R+).  This highlights another risk
of online documentation: without a careful versioning scheme, it is
easy to find oneself fetching documentation for a different version of
the software than the code at hand.

Subject: Risks of online catalogs

Cliff Stoll makes an excellent critique of online catalogs in his new book
_Silicon Snake Oil_. He enumerates many of the criticisms that contributors
to RISKS have discussed.

I recently ran into a problem with the online catalog for the library where
I work. Asking to see the card catalog, I was told that it was 2-3 years out
of date. The online catalog that replaced it accessed classified information
and was therefore unavailable for general use. The librarian had to perform
the search for me. Since I was looking for a specific book, it was not a
problem. On the other hand, if I was doing more general research, I would
have been stymied.

Subject: Computer-controlled electrocution (RISKS-17.06)

People seem upset by the use of a computer to control an electric chair.
While I agree that electrocution is horrifying, nobody has identified the
computer-related risk.  The claimed "risk" seems to be that computers and
other electronic devices are being used to kill.  But how do the inventors
of those gadgets feel about the fruits of their labor being used by military
forces?

The obvious actual risk is that the computer might make more mistakes
than human executioners, or might make worse ones.  But the human
executioners apparently already have a record of botched executions,
so a proper assessment would have to weigh the risks on both sides.

Of course a better solution might be to do away with electrocutions
altogether, but that debate doesn't concern the use of computers.
