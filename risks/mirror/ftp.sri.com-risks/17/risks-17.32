   Martin Virtel wrote a wonderful article "Fehler, Fehler, Feler" in 
   Die Zeit (Nr. 33, 11 Aug 1995, page 49) observing the 10th anniversary 
   of RISKS.  The following item came to him as a response from a 
   German teacher, Thiomir Glowatzky, of Bamberg.  I include the German, 
   with "u umlaut" being represented as "|", but the essence of it is simply
   that the spelling corrector wanted to replace

      Kafka, Musil and Schnitzler
 
   with 

      Kaffee, M|sli, and Schnitzel.

   It must have been from Hungery.  PGN

Subject: Bogus check for $95,093.35 deposited and retained!

RISKS readers may be interested in the story to be found on the web at
	http://www.dnai.com/g-think/$$tablecontents.html

It tells of a man (Patrick Combs) who, according to himself, deposited into
an ATM a "check" for $95,000.  This "check" was one of the authentic-looking
come-on gimmicks that we so often receive in our junk mail.  In this case,
it was a solicitation for a get-rich-quick scheme and the "check" was
purportedly an "example of the kind of money" one could earn using this
scheme.

The "check" bore a valid signature and account number as well as a realistic
amount ($95,093.35).  The only indication that it was not a valid document
was the phrase "not negotiable for cash" inconspicuously placed in a corner.
More interestingly, the "check" met all nine of the legal criteria for a
valid bearer document.

Apparently, the warning message was not seen and the amount was credited to
Mr Combs' account.  The amount remained in his account for several weeks
and, after repeated inquiries to the bank Combs withdrew the money in the
form of a cashier's check, which he then placed in a safe-deposit box.

Throughout the story, Combs maintains that he had/has no fraudulent intent.
The fact that he has not spent a cent of the money despite ample opportunity
to do so lends credence to his claim.  Eventually, of course, the bank
detected the error and demanded its money back.  Its method of treating Mr
Combs will be familiar to many of us who have had to deal with inflexible
financial institutions.

However, the story is complicated by the fact that (by both law and many
legal precedents) Mr Combs is now legally entitled to keep the money.  Banks
must refuse payment within a fixed time period and must serve notice in a
specific manner, both of which Combs' bank has failed to do.  The story
details his research into the legal side of it, as well as his negotiations
with the bank.

In reading this story, a number of RISKS-related issues came to my mind:
	- Combs apparently ascertained that none of the bank tellers would
	  be held liable for the fault, since the "check" was deposited into
	  an ATM.  But *someone* had to open those envelopes and verify the
	  data.

	- Combs comments that he was under the impression that checks of
	  greater than a certain amount were subject to additional
	  verification.  That clearly did not happen here.  Why?  No
	  information is given in the story as to what part of this process
	  is manual and what is automatic.

	- Through a bit of social engineering, Combs claims to have traced
	  the flow of the money: apparently his bank got the money from the
	  clearinghouse bank in Chicago (which also missed the
	  non-negotiable warning).  It was not until the "check" was sent to
	  the Federal Reserve bank that it was rejected; the money was then
	  retrieved by the Chicago bank from Combs' bank which no doubt
	  assumed it could get the money back from Combs.  However, they
	  waited 16 days from the time they received notice of their error
	  and by that time the money was gone from Combs' account.  Who was
	  responsible for generating notice to Combs?  How did they fail to
	  take action?  Again, it is unclear how much, if any, of the bank's
	  procedures are automated.

	- There is also a social RISK in that the bank's treatment of Combs
	  has clearly exacerbated the problem and generated a good deal of
	  cost and negative publicity for the bank (as well as the obvious
	  monetary loss).  Banks, despite being in a customer service
	  business, have gained a widespread reputation for inflexibility
	  and for gouging customers for ever-increasing charges and fees.
	  Combs asks readers to suggest what he should do, and opinion is
	  clearly against the bank.  As new digital technologies make cash
	  and location less important, banks RISK putting themselves out of
	  business altogether if they are not seen to be serving their
	  customers.

It seems clear that a large number of procedures must have broken down in
this story.  It is also interesting that the Federal Reserve, which deals
with a much larger volume of paper, was able to catch an error that two
local banks did not catch.  I confess that I voted for Combs to keep the
money or give it to charity, in large part because of my reaction to the way
the bank treated him and how I have been treated by banks in the past.

I hope RISKS readers find the story interesting and worth their time to
investigate.

Subject: Automated bridge risk

(I was absent of the town at the time of this event, so there may be some
errors, but the core is solid.)

This week Kuopio, a small town in Finland faced sudden problem with
automated bridges.

The town is located in the middle of a lake district, wonderful
transportation method during past centuries but a problem if you use cars
instead of boats. The only way from the town to north (to airport among
other places) is through one bridge, which has one (small) openable bridge
for boats.

Suddenly one morning the bridge, which (as you may have guessed) is
computer-controlled, opened without any reason in the middle of the morning
rush. No-one going to work could get anywhere in the north side of the town.
The bridge was not manned (since it was not in use at that moment) and it
took some time to get anyone there. The bridge computer didn't do anything
and there was no manual button to force closing of the bridge(!!!!!).

The bridge had to be closed by hand, using crank, by several strong men
turning the wheels. Interviewed representative said that the situation
occurred due to "unpredicted combination of events" (what else :-}) if my
memory does not fail me. (What events they were, I haven't heard of.)

The risk is old and well-known on this list: Automation of something 
without leaving backup-system.

The good side is that the automatic lights and fences connected to 
the bridge-system worked well and warned people that the bridge is 
raising, so there was no risk to people.

Subject: Another "Units" crash...

  The NTSB ruled that human error augmented by fatigue probably caused the
  crash of a DC-8 cargo plane Feb. 16 at Kansas City International Airport,
  killing all three crew members.  [...]  The NTSB found the pilot lost
  control of the DC-8 on takeoff, mainly because the flight engineer used
  the wrong calculations to determine how fast to supply power to the
  engines.  The engineer based his calculations on Fahrenheit temperatures
  instead of centigrade as he should have.  [Excerpts from AP reports]

RISKS readers will recall the Gimli incident in Canada where another metric
conversion error led to a shorter-than-expected flight.

As often pointed out by my EE prof's, calculators let you get the
wrong answer 10 times as fast....

Subject: Mass Pike Electronic Toll Collection Update

I was listening to Boston rock-and-roll station last week when I heard an
advertisement criticizing the Mass Pike's RFP for an electronic toll
collection system.  I called the company, ATCOMM, based in Marblehead,
Massachusetts and spoke with Mike Greenstein to get details:

Recently, the Mass legislature passed a law requiring the Pike to develop
standards for electronic toll collection.  The Pike responded with a Request
for Proposals (RFP) which substantially narrowed the allowable technical
solutions.

The Pike's RFP specifically wants to have a centralized accounting
mainframe.  As the driver approaches, an electronic tag (about the size of a
pack of cards) is polled and this is used to debit his account.  The user's
balance is displayed by the tool booth as the driver goes through.
Information about the user's movements are entered immediately to the
centralized database.

ATCOMM sells a technology which adds a keypad, microprocessor, and an LCD
display to the tag.  The keypad allows the user to ask questions about his
balance at any time, and the LCD displays the remaining balance.  ATCOMM's
technology was specifically excluded by the narrow RFP and so the decided to
go to the radio campaign to make their case, alert the drivers and other
stakeholders that this is an issue.

I asked Mr. Greenstein about the motivation for the Pike's RFP and he was
unwilling or unable to speculate.

The Mass Pike is a quasi-independent agency by virtue of its bond contracts
and independent of governmental oversight.  The Pike has been a source of
patronage jobs with mutual backscratching between the Democratic party
government officials and the Pike's authorities.  However, recently, Gov.
Weld has moved to bring the Pike under government control and this will take
place Summer next year.

According to Mr. Greenstein, there's no concern for privacy of drivers, and
this does not appear to have been the Pike's motivation for issuing the RFP
calling for a centralized database.  ATCOMM could be programmed to ensure
privacy, but currently it is not.  There's some small benefit to ATCOMM's
technology, because the information about the movements of specific cars
through the tolls is not centralized, but kept at the toll facility.
However, this can be collected periodically so there's little difference
from the centralized scheme.  Probably, privacy is not a big selling point
for companies making proposals to governmental RFPs.

Subject: MS-Word "Find File" feature scales poorly with MAE/NFS

Macintosh Application Environment (MAE) is a product that runs on Sun and
Hewlett-Packard workstations, emulating a Macintosh computer under
X-Windows.  It allows 680x0 based Macintosh applications to run on the
workstation accessing the Unix filesystem (including NFS partitions) as if
they were folders and files on the Mac.

Recently, a secretary who was new to the Mac environment tried to access a
file she had saved from her mailer in Unix from MS-Word under MAE.  She knew
what the name of it was, but wasn't sure *where* it was, so, when she saw
the "Find File" feature in the "Open File" dialog box thought that she would
try it...

Unfortunately, the workstation was connected to a 256GB NFS fileserver which
MS-Word under MAE dutifully began to search.  Furthermore, neither MAE nor
MS-Word made it apparent how to cancel the request once it was set into
motion.  (Alt-'.', which often works in a Mac environment did nothing.)
Even stranger, the X11 window manager ceased to respond to requests to
pop-up the window's menu to close it.

Fortunately, there were still some Unix windows around to "kill" the MAE
process--but at a loss of any unsaved information created previously in the
MAE session.

The RISK?  Perhaps that scale factors were not considered in the design of
the "Find File" feature.  The Mac Style Guide states that all applications
must confirm operations that are either not "undoable" or which may perform
extensive changes.  Perhaps a similar rule should apply: all operations
which may take an extensive amount of time to complete should include a
status window with a cancel operation.

Or perhaps, the cancel operation *does* exist, but by the time I got there
the X display server was not refreshing the "exposed" regions on the MAE
window (after having been covered and uncovered) so that only a rapidly
changing filename was visible in the middle of an otherwise blank region of
the screen...  In that case, the RISK may be in reliance of X-Windows or
other software emulation to reliably reproduce the emulated hardware
environment.

From: "Marc Rotenberg" <rotenberg@epic.org>
Subject: 10 ARGUMENTS AGAINST COMMERCIAL KEY ESCROW (CKE)

1. Increased network vulnerability.  The key escrow configuration
necessarily increases the likelihood of communications compromise and
improper interception by third parties. Computer crime will skyrocket.

2. Policy incoherence.  The key management needs of business differ sharply
from the real-time intercept plans of law enforcement. The latter has little
to do with the former.

3. Emergency circumstances taps.  The current wiretap law permits the
initiation of a wiretap *without court order* upon a certification that
emergency circumstances exist. If this procedure is built into the CKE
procedure, then there will be *no judicial review* prior to the disclosure
of keys.

4. Complexity.  Has anyone really given thought to how many communications
will be encrypted in 20 years and what the key management requirements will
be to develop a unitary key escrow system to satisfy the government's
concerns?  Its staggering.

5. Cost-benefit. The Bush White House rejected the original digital
telephony bill for this reason.  As time has passed, the argument has
strengthened. The cost to match each new technology with an intercept
capability is rising rapidly.  The benefits of wiretap are falling.

6. Intrusiveness. How will the government monitor compliance by escrow
agents and crypto users with statutory requirements?  Will separate
penalties exist for escrow agents and key holders who negligently fail to
comply with procedures even though there is no evidence of criminal conduct?
If so, law enforcement could "pull over" anyway on the info highway who is
using crypto (the broken tail light problem).

7. The future of PGP.  Will PGP and other non-escrow schemes be permitted if
CKE is adopted? What will be the implications for developers and companies
in the communications industry?  The

8. Ability to Defeat. It will be trivial to send non-interpretable
communications in a key escrow network -- foreign dialect, bury text in
graphics, speak in code!  The bad guys know all about this. They've assumed
their phones were tapped for years.

9. The Long Term. Where does the CKE policy take us in 20 years?  A secure
network where crime is more difficult or a platform for surveillance of
private communications and compromise of business information?

10. Oklahoma City. For more than a year, the White House warned that if
Clipper was not adopted terrible terrorist incidents on US soil similar to
the World Trade Center could not be prevented.  Guess what? It happened and
Clipper, CALEA and all these other dumb ideas didn't prevent the deaths of
170 innocent people. The FBI hadn't even bothered to request a wiretap
warrant for this type of threat (arson, weapons, explosives) since the late
1980s.

Subject: Pittsburgh HOV Follow-up

A couple of follow-up items regarding the recent head-on crash on
Pittsburgh's HOV lane.

A Pennsylvania Department of Transportation worker has admitted that he made
a mistake and opened the northbound gate before closing the south- bound
gates.  There is no interlock of any sort to prevent this.  The worker in
question has been fired.

There apparently is still some question as to whether this led to the accident
or not.

I mentioned some dual-use ramps downtown.  One of the ramps in question
(near Three Rivers Stadium) actually is a single ramp with an exit and an
entrance.  When the entrance is officially closed there is a barrier across
it.  To enter erroneously (if the barrier is in place) one has to make an
extremely acute right hand turn onto the exit ramp (or be traveling the
wrong way on the major street surrounding the stadium.)  I view this as no
different than the arrangements on many such lanes around the country (e.g.,
the express lanes on the Kennedy Expressway in Chicago.)  The other downtown
ramp in question is at Anderson Street, and as best I can tell from the
photos is a true dual use ramp.  There is no possibility of a barrier at
this location.

Just to clarify: the attack method reproduced on page 185 of the September  
1995 issue of C'T (which allegedly lead to forged mail
From: <president@whitehouse.gov>) is the telnet-to-sendmail-type mail  
forgery attack described many times, i.e. in alt.2600.faq available from  
mail-server@RTFM.mit.edu among others.

In my eyes, using the old sendmail on one hand and banning the export of
software capable of message authentification (this is, PGP) on the other
makes up to a pretty bad (this is, risky) policy regarding electronic
exchange of information.

One more thing: does anybody around have a CCopy for me

Subject: US White House Hacked?  sendmail or SMTP? (Kennedy, RISKS-17.31)

The article "US White House Hacked?" describes a series of forged messages
sent to computer users; the sender was supposedly Bill Clinton.  It then
describes the reaction to it, including a dispute about whether the White
House computer was broken into and the forgeries sent from it.

What surprised me the most was the assumption that sendmail had been used or
even that a break-in had occurred.  Why?  In 1985, we forged a letter from
Opus the Penguin at whitehouse.arpa (which didn't exist) to our office staff
asking for more kippered herring heads at our weekly meetings.  (Those
meetings were in the bloomin' county ...)  All it takes is knowing the SMTP
protocol, and being able to access port 25.  So, given the information in
the article, I'd go with Occam's Razor and assume someone did it that way.

      ['Occam dead, Matt!]

In particular, this part:

  He claimed the White House uses an old version of software for electronic
  mail handling which is obsolete. This program makes it possible to falsify
  mail.  Many other System Administrators also use this older version,
  leaving the network vulnerable to similar attacks.

was somewhat depressing; I would think the editor of a computer magazine
would know better than to assert mail forgery is due to an "old version of
software" and not due to the nature of the underlying protocols.
