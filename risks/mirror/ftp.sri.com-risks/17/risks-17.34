Subject: Open letter to Geoff Greiveldinger, DoJ [key escrowed, export] 

NIST (the National Institute of Standards and Technology) held a two-day
public meeting on 6-7 September, 1995 to discuss Software Key Escrow as a
possible means of achieving export of cryptography.

In the morning of 7 Sept, Goeff Greiveldinger of the Department of Justice
gave a description of the kinds of crimes which DoJ wants to use wiretapping
to solve.  He closed this litany of lawbreaking with the assertion that
software manufacturers don't want to provide products which allow such
lawbreakers to keep their criminal evidence hidden from law enforcement.

I'm sorry to disillusion you, Geoff, but I *do* want to make such systems.

Would you have Ryder stop renting trucks because some terrorist decided to
fill one with explosives and kill many innocent children?  Would you have
Americans stop making automobiles because bank robbers have been known to
use cars for getaways?  Would you have all new buildings constructed with
FBI microphones in every wall because some criminals meet in private rooms
in order to plan crimes?

When an American company sweeps its conference room for bugs, finds some and
destroys them, it doesn't matter whether those bugs were planted by industrial
spies or the FBI.  The company has a right to eliminate them.  When that
company ties two such conference rooms together by video-conference equipment
and encrypts the line between them using strong link encryption, it is
performing the same defensive operation in cyberspace.  It is protecting
itself from spies and it doesn't matter that the wiretaps it frustrates might
be illegal ones by industrial spies or legal ones by the FBI.  The right to
attempt to achieve privacy is a long-standing one in this country and not one
to allow to be lost.

When I design and build systems for privacy for my customers, I am providing
products for law-abiding, honest people.  I am aware of criminals, of
course.  Criminals are the threats against whom I protect my customers.
These criminals are usually not in the government but that doesn't mean that
I believe I should offer my honest customers up for a strip-search in
cyberspace.  The law enforcement agencies of this free country have no right
to expect blanket access to the ciphertext of citizens.  It will take
legislation to get that right and I will do everything in my power to keep
such legislation from passing.  Barring such legislation, I will make sure
that honest American citizens have cryptography with which to attempt to
maintain their privacy, even from the government.  We have the right to
attempt to keep a secret from government agencies and continuous
demonstration of that right is an important part of this free country.

On the other hand, I am sympathetic to law-enforcement officers.  I have
several friends in that business.  I have asked my friends and acquaintances
who do surveillance (2 IRS agents investigating organized crime for tax
evasion; 2 undercover cops in Boston's highest drug neighborhood; 1 DEA
agent in the midwest) if they ever encounter encrypted communications or
files.  They don't.  Neither does anyone in their offices.  Of course, even
if they did it would remain so important to preserve our right to attempt to
keep secrets from the government that their frustration would just have to
be accepted.  The fact that this isn't a real problem makes my decision that
much easier.  I am left with no moral qualms at all.

In summary, criminals are so few that I will not design for them.  I will not
treat my vast majority of honest users as if they were criminals just because
some criminal might someday use my product and frustrate you.

ObRisk: We run the risk of losing our fundamental right to attempt to keep a
secret from the government -- a practice we need to preserve in order to
protect ourselves from criminals in cyberspace.  There are powerful forces in
the US government attempting to cajole us into giving up that right.

Certainly not the first such item seen in RISKS (Coke machines...), but
you've got to admit that taking 6 months to identify the source of calls
arriving every 90 minutes has to be some kind of record!

Persistent oil tank hassles woman

BILLERICA, Massachusetts - For six months, a woman thought she was in
tele-marketing hell.  Every 90 minutes, her phone would ring, but the caller
would never say a word.

The phone company eventually traced the calls to an abandoned oil tank in
Maryland. It was rigged to call the oil company when the oil level was low,
but the phone number was scrambled and it called her instead.

  Computer trouble results in fatal fall
	
  NEWARK, Del. (AP) -- A University of Delaware student fell 13 floors to
  his death out of his dormitory window, apparently after he lost his balance
  when he put his fist through the glass in anger over computer trouble.
	
  Robert Keepers, 19, of Spotswood, N.J., went through the 5-foot

  Keepers "got up and ran around the room in a pique of anger" and struck
  the window with his fist, said Tim Brooks, dean of students, citing the
  account of two students who were in Keeper's room during the accident.
	
Well, I had never considered this risk of incorrectly operating equipment
before; however, I have no need to fear.  My dormitory window is a scant

Subject: Initiative for better Usenet discussions

This initiative has been out for a while but it only now occurred to me that
it is in the subject matter for comp.risks. Endless newsgroup discussions
and flame wars are certainly a computer risk; yet the potential of News (as
forums such as this one have demonstrated) is great and it is a pity to see
it wasted.

To see if I can help improve the situation I have started a modest program
called SELF-DISCIPLINE. In keeping with the spirit of the program, which is
to maximize signal and minimize noise, I will not describe SELF-DISCIPLINE
here, but just give the pointer to the Web page that presents it:

Cheswick and Bellovin's "Firewalls and Internet Security" (cf. BKFRINSC.RVW)
will continue to be seen as the classic reference with the seriously
technical crowd.  Chapman and Zwicky, however, have here created the first
reference for the more normal run of system administrators: those whose
lives do not revolve around hacking the UNIX kernel.
 
Part one could almost stand as a separate book, itself.  It is an
introduction to firewalls.  More, it is a very down-to-earth and practical
guide to evaluating security needs and planning for security systems and
practices.  The writing is completely clear, and the explanations
first-rate.  Chapter four, on firewall architectures, is a perfect
introduction for the manager who, while not having a technical background,
must lead or administer a security project.
 
Part two gets into more technical details of firewall construction and the
communications needs for Internet services.  The writing, though, is still
clear and easily accessible to any intelligent reader.  Part three covers
maintenance and administrative work.  Appendices list information and
software resources as well as a brief introduction to TCP/IP basics.
 
This is the first book that truly explains, to the non-specialist, the
various factors and functions involved in firewall choice and construction.
For those building their own and for those evaluating vendor proposals, this
book is a must.

Subject: Re: Voting by Phone in the Netherlands (PAT, RISKS-17.33)

   The TELECOM Digest's Editor wrote:

> They'll hear none of it ... which is odd, [...]  PAT

   Not odd at all.  The editor answered his own question.  There are many
people in office today who know they got there due to fraudulent voting
practices.  (No reason to name names, but there are still two seats in the
US House of Representatives being contested due to fraud, and one state
governership from last year's elections.)  There have been many such
"elected officials" in the past, and there will be more in the future.

   So there are two types of voting systems, those that work privately and
without risk of fraud, and those where fraud is impossible to prove in
hindsight, and often impossible to stop on the spot.  There are very, very
few of the former in use anywhere in the world, mostly in uncontested
elections to corporate boards of directors. :-(

   If we really want trustworthy voting systems, someone other than
the politicians will have to impose them.

   And now to relate this to comp.risks.  It is getting to be much harder to
cheat.  Exit polls and computer based vote projections can show where the
votes were diddled and by how much.  There have been many incidents around
the world where the incumbents resorted to force when massive fraud was
revealed by exit polling, international observers, etc.  In some cases, like
the Philippines, where Cory Aquino was declared the winner in the exit polls
and the streets, and the official vote tallies ignored, the net effect has
been beneficial.  But in many other cases the result has been years of
bloodshed.  Some leaders have even started wars to avoid (or win) elections
they couldn't win otherwise.  (No, not Maggie, the Argentinian Generals.
Margaret Thatcher just called an immediate election once the war was over
because she was well ahead in the polls.)

   If we don't insist that the quality of the actual voting procedures be at
least as trustworthy as the widely available means for predicting the
results, all we will be encouraging is further bloodshed.  (And we also need
to insist on a diversity of sources of predictions.)  Right now the polls
you see and hear in the news before elections have an expected error of 3 to
6 per cent.  The results of exit polls are much more accurate, usually in
the 1/2 to 1 per cent range.  This has resulted in a strange marriage of
convenience with a single organization doing almost all the exit polls and
vote tabulations in the US, with the TV networks and the politicians as
customers.  (The different networks base their own projections on the same
data.  There have been lawsuits by smaller parties because their results
have not been included in the published data.)

too a virus!  Read and infected Word doc, and it infects your Word macro

the NORMAL.DOT file, and gets stored between sessions.  Once the macro space
ahs been infected, any files saved with the FileSaveAs function are infected
themselves.  Send somebody an E-mail message over the MSN, and in one mouse

Subject: 'Tis too a virus! (PGN comment, RISKS-17.33)

Must disagree. Within its target environment (default WORD 6.0 or better),
it satisfies the difference between a "trojan horse" and a "virus" in that it
is able to propagate. Such an AutoOpen macros could be a trojan, but in this
easy-to-block case (and both of MS's fixes, WD1215 and the later one whose 
number I forget seem to target this virus specifically - have looked at 1215 
but not the other so caveat y'all).

I would be surprised if this is anything more than a "15 minutes of fame" but
does point out the value of turning the default "do anything you want without
notice" off. ("Prompt to save Normal" & "DisableAutoMacros" are good starting 
points - of course if you disable these, the MS "fix" won't work...

BTW, essentially this is traceable to ANSI bombs and programmable PF keys on
the VT-100 (had to put the sequence in a companion .com (DCL) but have seen
it done) so capability dates back at least to the late 1970's. Same thing
would work on a uVax as well as a 780 so guess that made it
"cross-platform". And then there was the VT-103...

If it stores itself in the global template file, then it can be loaded every
time Word starts. Hence, it has "infected" Word, and can cause any documents
saved ("FileSaveAs") to carry the "virus", which will then execute the viral
loader if these documents are loaded in another copy of Word.

This seems to make a good case for being a virus: infection of a host and 
the ability to reproduce toward the goal of infecting other hosts.

I was quite distressed to read the article in the RISKS-17.32 by Alan
Wexelblat about a man (Combs) who deposited a fake check for $95000 and
withdrew the money.  Clearly, the system failures in the case are worth
discussing.  But I wonder how many readers were taken aback as I was by the
amoral slant to the article?  On the face of it, Combs appears no more than
a common thief, and the only "service" I can imagine the bank owes to him is
to have him arrested for passing bad checks.

Regardless of any legal quirks, or how the bank treated him, the test is
simple: did he knowingly take money not belonging to him, and keep it?  If
so, morally he is a thief, regardless of what a lawyer might make of it.

Concerning the ban on self-disabling software, two questions occur to me:

- I wonder how often such software uses a simplistic, date-driven algorithm
that is triggered if an operator mistypes the system date.  And using other
measures (such as total number of invocations) could lead to wildly
differing period-'til-disablement values for different users, according to
their work habits.

- It occurs to me that it might be argued that buggy software is itself a
form of self-disablement.  I wonder how hard a good lawyer would have to
work to argue that this law makes software with non-trivial bugs illegal
_per se_.

Subject: Re: Password cracking 'improves' security (Booth, RISKS-17.33)

While I don't know anything about this particular program, I did hear
recently about a program with similar functions. The following may be
apocryphal, as I have not been able to verify details and did not hear the
story from anyone who claimed to have experienced it firsthand.
                                                                               
The marketers of the alleged program found an interesting problem: it worked
so fast that it destroyed users' confidence in the security of their
passwords, with the result that they just turned them off and didn't buy any
more copies of the password recovery program.
                                                                               
The reported marketing response was ingenious: the program's developer
inserted a no-op loop into the password-recovery process so that instead of
taking about a second, it took several minutes.  This made it look like the
program was doing something hard; the users liked the modified program much
better and didn't lose confidence in the built-in "security" of their
applications.
                                                                               
As Laurie Anderson might say, "Hmmmmm".                                        

  [Based on the net address and RISKS-15.41, I must presume that the

Duncan Booth <Duncan@rcp.co.uk> posted a note about a product called WDPass
that claims to crack passwords for a number of products.  I suspect that, by
reducing the risk of lost passwords, this would indeed increase the
likelyhood that careless users would use password protection, and the
increased use of passwords would improve security in the face of casual
browsing and similar common but low-level threats.  At the same time, the
product clearly exposes the well known (at least in technical circles)
triviality of the password protection schemes used on many common products.

If the product works against the password protection scheme used by Lotus

You're assuming that everyone will realize this product exists.  A
knowledgeable attacker would not be deterred by the encryption features of
existing software, but it might be enough to deter a casual attacker.  But
at the same time management might downplay the encryption features from fear
of a subordinate trying to "hide" crucial information.

Alas, many environments don't even have those "traditional locks and keys."
Oh, the offices will be locked at night and care will be applied when
deciding which employees get keys... but then they'll have minimum wage temp
employees come in to remove the trash.

In this case the _only_ effective protection in place might be the
encryption provided by those packages.  A knowledgeable attacker will be
prepared, but it might be enough to stump a compromised custodial staff
member.
