Subject: Prodigy Held Liable

A New York state trial court ruled on 24 May 1995 that Prodigy is
responsible for the libelous statements of its users because it exercises
editorial control over their posts. In the case, an anonymous Prodigy user
made statements against New York Investment firm Stratton Oakmont accusing
it of criminal and fraudulent acts. Stratton Oakmont sued Prodigy and the
volunteer moderator of the forum where the statements were published.

The Court found that Prodigy was acting as a publisher and therefore was
responsible for the content of the posts. The Court distinguished the case
from the earlier Cubby v. Compuserve decision, which found that Compuserve
was subject to the standards of a bookstore or library. It that case, the US
District court ruled that Compuserve had no editorial control over the text.
According to the New York state court:

  In contrast, here Prodigy has virtually created an
  editorial staff of Board Leaders who have the ability to
  continually monitor incoming transmissions and in fact do
  spend time censoring notes. Indeed, it could be said that
  Prodigy's current system of automatic scanning,
  guidelines, and Board Leaders may have a chilling effect
  on freedom of communications in Cyberspace, and it appears
  that this chilling effect is exactly what Prodigy wants,
  but for the legal liability that attaches to such censorship.
   
  Let it be clear that this court is in full agreement with
  Cubby and Auvil. Computer bulletin boards should generally
  be regarded in the same context as bookstores, libraries
  and network affiliates...It is Prodigy's own policies,
  technology and staffing decisions which have altered the
  scenario and mandated the finding that it is a publisher.

The court also attempted to downplay the significance of its 
decision on the greater area of electronic networks:

  Prodigy's conscious choice, to gain the benefits of editorial
  control, has opened it up to greater liability that Compuserve
  and other computer networks that make no such choice. For the
  record, the fear that this Court's finding of publisher status
  for Prodigy will compel all computer networks to abdicate        
  control of their bulletin boards, incorrectly presumes that
  the market will refuse to compensate a network for its 
  increased control and the resulting increased exposure.

The Court also found that the volunteer "Board Leader" of the Prodigy
Bulletin Board was acting as an agent of the company. The Court found
Prodigy exercised control over the Board Leaders though the the Bulletin
Board Leader Agreement and the actions of Prodigy's employees.

Prodigy has said that it will consider appealing the decision. EPIC has
materials on free speech available at http://epic.org/free_speech/ We will
be making a copy of the decision available in the next few days.

>From the Associated Press news wire via CompuServe's Executive News Service:

	Hacker High, by RAYNER PIKE,	Associated Press Writer 

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Some of New York's best and brightest set out 
	to show that they can rush in where high schoolers are not 
	supposed to tread -- the computer systems of Ivy League colleges. 
	They succeeded. Their principal was not amused. Their victims 
	were not impressed.  The systems of Columbia and Princeton, as well
        as Bucknell University, were targeted by hackers from the elite
        Stuyvesant High School. 

Key points:

o	Principal said, "No harm was done and none was intended."

o	School adding ethics classes to computer courses.

o	Bucknell University staff said the hack was a prank and not slick.

o	"...students got a couple of Bucknell passwords and used them to 
	send E-mail. They left one note without removing coding that 
	tracked the sender back to Stuyvesant, a public school for 
	academically gifted children."

o	Students used one Columbia University ID but no obvious damage.

o	Princeton IDs and passwords obtained but apparently not used.

	WP   05/29       NETWORKINGS

	Making the On-Line Community Safe for Decency -- and Democracy 
 	By John Schwartz  
	Washington Post Staff Writer  

	Sen. James Exon sounds for all the world like a man who's ready 
	to make a deal. Sitting in his Capitol office, the Nebraska 
	Democrat puffs amiably on his pipe and discusses the bill that 
	has made him anathema to many people in the on-line community, 
	the Communications Decency Act.

	Exon's bill, part of the Senate version of a broad 
	telecommunications bill, would impose jail terms and fines on 
	those who create or solicit on-line material that is deemed 
	"obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent."

Key points:

o	Massive opposition from all sectors, including the Dept of Justice.

o	"For the record, Exon has no personal experience on-line, but 
	says he finds the positive uses of the networks exciting."

o	Christian Coalition's http://www.cc.org home page has support
	for such restrictions.

o	Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) wants to clamp down on anarchist files.

o	The author writes:

	...a Justice Department memo ... describes the bill as an 
	enforcement nightmare that would criminalize constitutionally 
	protected speech. The memo concluded it would clash with other 
	laws and "hamper the government's ongoing work in stopping the
	dissemination of obscenity and child pornography and threaten 
	law  enforcement's continued ability to use court-authorized 
	wiretaps."
 
o	The Exon bill would make materials which are legally available 
	in print illegal if obtained online.

o	Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-VT) proposes to help parents exercise
	greater control over their children's access to cyberspace using
	technology--"lockout boxes" like devices being made available to
	cable-TV subscribers.

o	The author quotes Sen. Leahy:

	"To say that everyone using the Internet is going to be held 
	to the standard of my neighbor's 7-year-old child is wrong -- 
	and is going to cripple the Internet," said Leahy....
	Overly restrictive legislation, he said, "will make one of 
	the best free-enterprise experiments a hollow shell."

o	The article ends with signposts for further information:

	The Exon bill is a hot topic on-line. You can find World Wide 
	Web sites devoted to the bill at http://www.cdt. org and 
	http://www.eff.org/pub/ Alerts maintained by the Center for 
	Democracy and Technology and the Electronic Frontier 
	Foundation, respectively. Folks whose Internet access is 
	limited to e-mail can get information by sending a message 
	to cda-infocdt.org in which the text area is left blank and 
	the subject line reads send-events. Sending the same message 
	to cda-statcdt.org will get you the current status of the bill.

Subject: Defying pitfalls of a cashless society

Defying pitfalls of a cashless society
Victor Keegan  (The Guardian, Economics Notebook, 30 May 1995)

The kingdom of cash is starting to be attacked in a pincer movement:
from in front, by electronic, or digital, cash, and from behind, by the
growing popularity of the barter system Letts - artificial local currencies
(rather like a baby-sitting points system), which people use instead of
real money to pay each other for services rendered.  [...]

The world's central banks -- including the Bank of England -- are beginning
to wake up to the fact that digital money could pose a threat to their
hegemony. This is particularly true of the so-called "electronic purses"
(like Mondex, which Midland Bank and others are pioneering) and, much more
so, the digital (and untraceable) cash being-pioneered by DigiCash, the
Amsterdam-based company.  [...]  As long as these are issued by banks-like
Midland's Mondex-then it is nothing more than another bank deposit, albeit
in electronic form.  [...]

Central banks have been sufficiently worried about the provision of
electronic purses getting into the wrong hands to set up a working group of
the European Monetary Institute. The conclusion was predictable: they are
all right-so long as they are restricted to approved credit institutions
(that is, banks), so that they can be properly monitored.

Enter DigiCash, whose founder, the proselytising David Chaum, wants to
create a digital system which could assume a life of its own. He has even
patented a process whereby a bank or a company could validate a secret
number which could be used as a unit of currency even though the issuing
authority could not trace it.

The place just waiting for such anonymous digital money (which would also be
rather useful for kidnappers and launderers of drug money) is the Internet,
the worldwide electronic cobweb of computer data bases.  [...]

Should the Net be provided with its own currency, it would suddenly become
not only a global market place, but a virtual economy as well. It could
become the first economy without a government or even a central bank at the
centre. But if there is no government, no one will pay taxes.  [...]

We are not talking science fiction. Mr Chaum has already distributed a
million digitised dollars to 5,000 pioneers taking part in a trial. Their
Cybercash can be spent purchasing goods and services from 50 companies
taking part in the trial.

At the other end of the scale, the growth of Lett schemes is not yet a
problem, if only because most of the schemes are small-scale and the people
involved are probably earning below the threshold at which they would be
required to pay tax. In a typical scheme one member might help another
build a wall, thereby earning himself currency points, to be exchanged for
work by someone else or for buying goods.

If such a scheme went nationwide and electronic (so that the participants
carried their points on a micro-chip on a plastic card), this could quickly
evolve into electronic money effectively outside the control of the banking
system and on which the participants would be reluctant to pay tax. The
transactions might even take place through the Internet.

Of course, central banks will move quickly if they feel their supervisory
role and their divine right to print money is being challenged. The point is
that the financial world is moving into uncharted waters. The change could
be as far-reaching as the transition from metals to money in the last
century.

  [What I found interesting was the way this article tied together (hi-tech)
  developments related to digital cash and the rise in popularity, at least
  here in the UK, of (typically low-tech) barter schemes.  BR]

From: Robert J Horn <rjh@world.std.com>
Subject: A slightly more global look at time and date issues

The date/time discussion illustrates two more global risks related issues.

1) There is a risk from overconfidence and lack of proper analysis when the
subject matter is something you have known "completely" since childhood.
People often get very excited or upset when they realize that there is
significant hidden complexity.  Most of us have achieved our full
understanding of time by the age of ten.  It has no more mysteries (except
perhaps time zones).  Discovering just how much more there is to time and
its measurement is a surprise.

QUIZ: For a more timely example than 18th century calendars, when does
Sunday become Monday?  (See below)

2) There is a significant misunderstanding around the relative merits
of integer vs floating point notation in general.

If your real world process can be represented as a finite field mapped onto
the integers, then you can eliminate concerns regarding representation
error.  This makes an integer representation attractive because it reduces
your error analysis problem to:

  a) Prove that the finite field mapping is correct.  

If your application involves division, you don't have a finite field.
You also better be sure that the finite field mapping is understood
the same way by all involved.  It can be a big problem if well into
your project you discover that you need additional resolution.  So
don't skip this step.

  b) Analyze the error characteristics of your algorithms in the
confident knowledge that the errors have been reduced to:

  initial error = measurement error, and
  results error = numerically propagated measurement errors.

Lots of people seem to think that you can skip the numerical analysis just
because your operations are on a finite field.  This is not the case.
Measurement error is still present and it still propagates.  I've seen too
many instances where people omit the error analysis because "integer
computations are error free".  You may have a finite field, but measurement
error must still be analyzed.

Still, the analysis is simpler and integers are often an excellent
representation for measured data.

With floating point representation, you have different advantages:
 a) Much greater dynamic range
 b) Much more uniform error characteristics (always present, but
    lacking the sudden lurch that occurs when your finite field mapping
    fails.) 
 c) The psychological pressure to analyze errors because some error
    is always present.

The difficulty is that your error analysis is harder:

  initial error = measurement error + representation error
  results error = propagated measurement error +
                  propagated representation error +
                  representation error.

This can be more work, although I have found that in most real world
situations the measurement errors have dominated.  Usually I could
completely ignore representation error because the measurement errors
were orders of magnitude larger.

Oh, and the answer to the quiz:

It depends upon what part of the world you are in.  In some areas,
the day ends at sunset.  So during some parts of the year, 1730
(local) Sunday occurs before 1800 (local) Sunday, and in other parts
of the year it occurs after.  And you need to know the latitude and
longitude to figure out when sunset occurs.  Is it any wonder that
people who care about time quickly end up using UTC for everything.
But this is a lurking trap for the unwary who want to make a properly
internationalized application that allows the use of local time.

Subject: "Calling the Ahperator"

My attempts to reach the long-distance operator from my Washington DC hotel
instead connected me to a voice-activated interface instructing me to say
"Operator" to get through, but my British pronunciation clearly didn't sound
right.  I found I could get through with a phony American "ahperader" but
only on the second attempt, the first attempt always getting a lengthy
recorded apology and a repeat of the (even lengthier) instructions.  Out of
frustration, I resorted to dialling the number direct, for which my hotel
charged me $95 for a call that would otherwise have cost $52.

It seems strange to require long-distance callers from DC hotels, many of
whom are presumably foreigners trying to reach overseas, to speak with an
American accent.  No alternative means of reaching the operator is offered,
and this could be a source of risk in emergency situations.  When I got
through to the supervisor to point this out, she agreed, but said, "You could
have dialled zero instead."  Why didn't I think of trying this?  But the
recorded instructions say nothing about this option.

The following was posted to a Local (New Zealand) group. Both iprolink and
Cybernet are ISP's servicing the Auckland market and targetting similar

Organization: Internet ProLink NZ, Auckland

Last week (15-20 May) Internet ProLink NZ, along with InfoTech Weekly,
TUANZ, Megascreen, Atrium on Elliott, and Dymocks, sponsored a week
long series of free Internet demonstrations at the Atrium in Auckland.

The event was marred by an attack on our system during the first three
days of the show.  The intent appears to have been to deny us the use
of our Internet connection during the show.

This posting should serve as a warning to system administrators.  Note
that eliminating these types of attacks requires filtering at the site
to whom you are connected, and that similar attacks with the traffic
destined to routers can be difficult to monitor.

Monday:
        Thousands of ICMP echo packets each minute from 202.36.227.10
        (mserve.cybernet.co.nz) saturate our link in both directions.
        These high priority packets almost completely prevent us from
        using our link at all.

        The packets initially were sent to iprolink.co.nz, but later
        to router1.iprolink.co.nz.

        The attack lasted approximately two hours from about 2:15 pm and
        stopped when we unplugged our link for several minutes.

Tuesday:
        ICMP packets sent to our router again completely saturate our
        link.  Attack begins around noon and ends when the University
        of Auckland temporarily disconnects Cybernet's link.

Wednesday:
        TCP packets (again from mserve.cybernet.co.nz) were sent to
        ports 7, 8, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,
        18, and finally port 19 on iprolink.co.nz, where our outbound
        link was saturated with traffic for more than one hour.  No
        further attacks were seen after Cybernet was contacted by the
        University of Auckland.

Our apologies to those who turned up for the show during these attacks
only to find that the Internet link was too slow to be used.

Thanks to the  University of Auckland Computer Center staff who did a
tremendous job in helping to monitor and stop this attack.

From: Daniel Frankowski <dfrankow@winternet.com>
Subject: Drug-Addicted Geniuses Built Cyberspace

I have the pleasure of presenting one of the most absurd claims I've read in
the mainstream press in a long time.

In the Minneapolis Star Tribune, Monday, May 22, 1995, on page 10A, yet
another inflammatory article about the Internet appeared, titled
``Cyberstoned''.  The article is adapted from Boston Magazine, written by
Stephen Rodrick at Boston Magazine and Vladimir Edelman, a Boston-based
freelance writer.

The point of the article was that there is drug dealing on the net, and that
there are net-specific problems for law enforcement.  I agreed with parts of
the article, e.g. that law enforcement needs to learn about the net, that
freedom of information and anonymity make law enforcement more difficult,
etc.  The writers give away their position when they report that ``after
Internet zealots howled about the loss of privacy, the fate of the Clipper
chip remains in doubt,'' but I forgive them.

Then they make an absurd pronouncement backed up by scant evidence:

  In fact, much of the cyberspace revolution of virtual reality, the
  Internet and other high-speed technology burst out of the minds of
  computer geniuses spaced out on drugs such as acid and ecstasy.  In his
  book *Cyberia: Life in the Trenches of Hyperspace*, Douglas Rushkoff
  traces the creation of the drug culture's special place on the Internet.

  `Developments in the computer industry and on the Internet are being made
  by the same people who made the counterculture of the '60s possible.
  Those willing to explore hallucinatory dreamlike realms that didn't exist
  before -- never-before-navigated turf of consciousness,' Rushkoff says.

I have a master's degree in computer science from the University of
Minnesota, and I read newspapers with regularity if not often.  I cannot
recall a single story about the arrest for drug possession of a computer
scientist familiar to me from their academic work.  Abramson, Tannenbaum,
Liskov, Stonebraker, Lazowska, not to mention my own professors and numerous
others have all thus far managed to hide their dirty little secret.

The risks?  Reporters who are not knowledgeable about computer science.
This risk generalizes easily: lawyers who are not knowledgeable about
computer science, patent clerks, politicians, bureaucrats, ..

If the two quoted paragraphs about "much of the cyberspace revolution"
coming from druggies annoyed you as much as it did me, please email the
Op-Ed page of the Minneapolis Star Tribune at opinion@startribune.com.
Ptooie!
