Subject: The risks of flying pigs

The Toronto Globe and Mail reports that a commercial jet carrying 72 pigs
and 300 human passengers had to make an emergency landing after having its
fire alarms triggered by excessive levels of methane, ammonia and body heat
in the cargo hold where the pigs were traveling (you surely did not expect
that the pigs were traveling economy class).  Apparently, excessive
flatulence, urine, droppings and the heat generated by the bodies of the
pigs caused the automated fire-extinguishing system to flood the cargo hold
with halon, killing 15 of the very valuable hogs. The risks of flying pigs
are evident.

Subject: Same Old Song: More calendar problems

For my personal E-mail, etc., I use the services of an Internet provider.  I
noticed today that the systems were still on Standard Time.  I sent a
message to the operators and received the following in return.

  Due to an obscure bug in the system libraries, for this particular switch to
  daylight savings time only, the system calculated when it should change to
  DST incorrectly.  (It thinks it does not start until this coming Sunday.)
  Because the bug will not occur in other years, and because we would have to
  rebuild all the system programs which depend on this system library, which
  would take longer than a week, we decided to just wait out the week until the
  clock returned to sanity.

  If this is causing you any specific problems, please let us know.

I'm sure this sort of thing is well documented in RISKS ... so much so I
continue to be surprised that I'm surprised that it continues to happen.

Subject:  The Risks of believing in Lawyers 

Atlas Computer Systems has fired the advertising consultant who suggested
that posting an advertisement to all the Usenet newsgroups was an effective
way of advertising a 1-gigabyte hard disc drive. Atlas suffered several days
of mail-bombing as well as repeated calls to its 1-800 number from irritated
Usenet readers. The New Scientist quotes Atlas's vice-president Matt Nye as
saying that the consultant suggested spamming the newsgroups after reading
Canter and Siegel's infamous publication "How to make a fortune on the
Information Superhighway".

It's nice to know there is some justice in the world. - Jacky Mallett

Subject: Re: More on German Train Problems (Weber-Wulff, RISKS-17.02)

: The defensive programmer will assume that all allocations will fail, 
: and structure the software to handle such a case. 

Furthermore, the software's ability to recover from the failure of any
particular allocation attempt must be tested if we're to have any confidence
in its working.  It is not enough merely to bear in mind the possibility of
allocation failure while writing the client code.

Is it feasible to test all possible allocation failure modes?  Forcing the
allocation routine to always fail would be pointless, since attempts to
allocate storage are likely to be contingent on the success of earlier
attempts.  Alternatively, one could maintain a counter N of program runs,
and coerce the allocator to fail on its N'th call.  This is a computational
effort proportional to the program run time multiplied by the number of
memory allocations in each run.  This exhaustive method would exercise all
possible failure modes for a given input, but is likely to be intolerably
time-consuming for real programs.

So we retreat to heuristic approaches.  One such involves examining the
sequence of stored program counters on the stack when the allocation routine
is called.  A checksum of the program counters can then be computed and
compared against a list of those already seen.  If no match is found, insert
the checksum into the list and return failure; if a match is found, allocate
the storage and return success.  Thus, upon the first appearance of a
particular sequence of program counters on the stack, the allocator will
return failure.  This has the desirable effect of exercising allocation
error recovery code that might appear anywhere in the call chain.  However,
if that error recovery code contains a bug that only manifests itself when
the program variables assume some particular state, the bug may not be
found.  Consider the following slightly contrived example in C:

    void *p1;
    void *p2;

    Bool allocate_p1_and_p2() 
    {
        int np1bytes;
        
        for ( np1bytes = 1024; (p1 = malloc( np1bytes)) == NULL; np1bytes >>= 1)
            ;
        p2 = malloc( 1);
        
        if ( p1 == NULL && p2 == NULL)      /* never satisfied */
            return TRUE;                    /* XXX: should be FALSE */
        else if ( p1 == NULL && p2 != NULL)
            free( p2);
            return FALSE;
        else if ( p1 != NULL && p2 == NULL)
            free( p1);
            return FALSE;
        else
            return TRUE;
   }

With the stack-examining allocator described above, the line marked
with "XXX" will never be executed, and its bug won't be found.

One can imagine an allocator that fails pseudo-randomly according to
some probability distribution, but again, the more failures, the
longer the run time, with no guarantee of finding all possible bugs in
the recovery code.

In the real world, people also make various adjustments when faced with
short lines, the most prominent of which is to use the service more,
causing the lines to get longer very fast. (NB: Note that people with
immediate heart problems are unlikely to come back later. :-( )

This is shown in analyses of real-world commuter traffic patterns. People
use the shortest way to work available. So if there's a congestion and you
build a new bypass, within a few weeks more people will use the new road,
until it's just as congested as before. Unless you eliminate all points
where congestions can form, which is of course impossible in the real
world.

The better way to reduce congestion is to offer an alternate service. 
For commuters, you use railroads (or tell them to stay at home and commute
electronically ;-)  -- for people with heart problems, the sensible solition
would probably be a fast-track way to get people with life threatening
problems ahead of those who wait for getting their warts burned off.
Don't ask me, though -- the real RISK is to jump to untenable conclusions
("halve the response time by standardizing on one defibrillator") based on
incomplete data.

Subject: Photo ATMs  (Re: Insecurity over ATM security, RISKS-17.03)

This reminds me of an incident that happened about 2 years ago.

In Toronto, we used to have these wonderful wall-mounted ATM's in shopping
malls.  They had high, wall-mounted, membrane keyboards, and were located
where lots of people could "hang out".

A generally shorter, thinner than average, female co-worker told us
that she had used such a machine, had entered a fairly complex
transaction, removing money from a secondary account.  A hour or
so later, while shopping for clothes, her purse was stolen.  Within
minutes, large amounts of money were removed from her accounts.

It was fairly obvious, that someone had watched and memorized her
entire key-sequence.  They then followed her, or sent someone to
steal her purse at an unguarded moment.

Luckily for her, it was shown that her PIN number was not obvious, 
and was not written down anywhere.  The bank fought furiously, but
she had family and friends with a lot of influence (threatened to
take out all their money), and she got her money back.

Although the bank denied everything, it was interesting to note, that
within months, all such machines were being ripped out from shopping
areas and being replaced with "shrouded" keyboards.  Also, "hidden"
cameras are now appearing everywhere.

Subject: re: Errors in patent databases (Gray, RISKS-17.01)

In RISKS-17.01, John Gray summarizes a report from New Scientist about
problem in searching databases of patents, including in particular problems
arising because of typos and spelling errors in the database.

Plus ca change, plus ce la meme chose.  In roughly 1980, I did some work on a
spelling checker program.  As part of this, I dug through the literature.  I
found an article - source and details long forgotten - that reported on an
empirical study of some kind of textual database.  The study found that a
significant portion of the entries in the database contained spelling or other
recording errors, many of them in the indexed portions of the data.  The
conclusion was that queries based on exact matches stood a significant chance
of failing to find entries they should have found.  I don't recall the domain
of the database involved, but as I recall missing even one entry that should
have matched was considered to be a problem.  As a result, they recommended
that all queries use some kind of "loose match" algorithm.  (I don't recall
if they suggested one.)

At least fifteen years later, we appear not to have learned this lesson.

This is, by the way, an example of a significant limitation of many
computer- based indexing systems: They make it difficult to use the *human*
ability to do smart approximate matching.  A couple of years ago, I heard a
fragment of an interview with an author of a book that sounded interesting.
I was only able to get the author's last name, and an understanding of the
meaning of the title - not the actual title.  When I later tried to use the
on-line catalogue at the local library, I found it very difficult to locate
the book.  The catalogue was tree-structured: I had to first choose a
particular author - and there were a good number of them with the same last
name - then view titles by that author, a few at a time.  I gave up after a
little while and located a paper copy of "Books in Print", where a few
seconds of scanning "by eye" located the book.  Computer interfaces work
well when you use them to do what the designers had in mind, but when it
comes to true flexibility, more traditional designs can often win big,
exactly because they are better at "getting out of the way" and letting the
pattern matcher in our heads do the work.

Subject: Risks of tightly-packed telephone-number space

Here in Saint Louis we're running low on telephone numbers.  With the 
rapid rise in cellular service, many new phone numbers have been 
assigned in this area code (314), leading to something of a shortage.

This causes (at least) two problems:
   1. more wrong numbers when people transpose digits
   2. rapid reassignment of numbers when service is disconnected

#1: wrong numbers are more likely to successfully connect -- to the 
wrong person

The first problem became REAL noticeable to me when some company in 
Australia tried to FAX documents to a decorating company in my 
exchange several times a night over several nights -- AT ABOUT 2:00 
AM, Saint Louis time.  They had the last 2 digits of the phone number 
transposed.  At no time did they try the number by hand or turn on / 
listen to their FAX speaker.  (You'd think that after several 
unsuccessful FAX attempts in a row to a new number, they'd try it 
with a voice phone!)

This is really a risk of having voice and data communications over 
the same network.

The fix:  I hooked up a FAX machine to my home phone and received the 
FAX one night.  By reading the FAX I could tell who sent it and who 
they were trying to send it to.  (The correct FAX number, without 
digits transposed, was printed on the FAX they sent!)  I forwarded 
the FAX to the intended recipient, and called them, asking them to 
talk to their Australian customer.  But their telephone operator was 
playing stupid that day, and kept asking what business relationship I 
had that their Australian customer would want to FAX documents 
through me.  Telling her about the transposed digits in the phone 
number didn't help.  Eventually I gave up and called the Australian 
company directly.  They understood the problem immediately.  (...and 
we wonder why we loose business to foreigners -- who have brains and 
use them.   ;-)

#2: disconnected numbers are more likely to connect -- with the wrong 
person

After moving in, I was given a number that had obviously just been 
released by someone moving out of my exchange.  For the first few 
months, I'd get several calls a week asking for the other person.  I 
called directory assistance and found his new number.  (He was still 
living in Saint Louis.)  When I get calls for him, I give them his 
new number.  There's nothing the telephone company can do to fix 
this, given the shortage of phone numbers.

It's amazing:  After 2 years, I still get 2 or 3 calls a month from 
sales people asking for that other person.  He must be on all the 
best "telephone sucker lists."  The sale people almost always give up 
as soon as they find I'm not who they're looking for.

Subject: RISKS of Digital Analogy [SATAN]

>      By close analogy, SATAN's parents' attitude appears to be that it's
> perfectly OK, perhaps even admirable, to go from house to house ...

and extends the analogy to argue that those probing systems
gratuitously should be punished even if they cause no harm.

I think that this quote illustrates well the RISKS associated with what
Usenet readers once referred to as "analogy wars" (did Tom Duff coin this
phrase?).  The risk comes in two parts:
	1) It is easy to confuse an analogy with an
	isomorphism, and behave accordingly.
	2) It is easy to take advantage of (1) to win an
	argument by choosing an analogy which, if treated as
	an isomorphism, leads to a desired conclusion.
In this particular case, consider the following scenarios:
	a) I decide to implicate X in a crime, so I hack a copy
	of SATAN so that it looks like my security probes are
	coming from X.
	b) I probe randomhost.subdomain.cs, and the DNS resolver
	decides that this must have been in Czechoslovakia.
What are some analogous situations in "burglary world"?
	a[b]) I disguise myself as X, and then deliberately let
	myself be caught burgling a house.
	b[b]) I decide to try to break into my own house to
	test its security, but accidentally try to break into
	another house which looks like mine.

Neither of these "burglary world" situations seems too likely.  This can be
seen to be a result of subtle problems in the analogy: In a[b], it would be
difficult to disguise oneself effectively enough to achieve the desired
result.  In b[b], I am unlikely to be confused about which house is mine. (I
also am unlikely to try to test a home's security by attempting a breakin.)

The "burglary world"
  [system == home, network == world, port == front door,
   security == lock, intruder == burglar,
   legal system == legal system]
analogy is very popular on the net, but it really doesn't seem to me to work
very well.  I find the final identity, in particular, very disturbing.  I
personally think that SATAN's authors (*not* parents :-) had the attitude
that "it's perfectly OK to send network packets to a computer system in
order to see how it responds" -- which seems to me like a much less
controversial statement.

Subject: SATAN, burglaries, and handcuffs (anonymous in RISKS-17.04)

The SATAN tool's proper use is very different: it's for checking YOUR OWN
systems.  I doubt that the unnamed correspondent, or anyone else, would
object to its use in that capacity.

The argument that SATAN should not have been released because it can probe
systems not under the prober's control strikes me as odd.  The analogy of
housebreaking given above overlooks that attempted burglary is illegal in most
jurisdictions that I know of.  That's what the intruder would be charged
with in the analogy above.  Does this mean we should ban all tools that
could be used to aid someone in checking the safety of a house, since
those tools can be used to find the weak points in another's house?

Perhaps a simpler conclusion to draw from the analogy is that there is no tool
or device that is completely beneficial.  Everything can be abused, and SATAN
is no exception.  The response should not be to focus on the release of the
tool, but to focus on educating people in the customary codes of behavior
and chastizing those who abuse the tools -- anyway, that's my opinion.  The
anonymous poster makes this same point later on, but its importance is vitiated
by the characterization of the morality of the authors of SATAN (a
characterization with which I disagree, by the way).

Matt Bishop

   [BTW, RISKS received too many responses to the original message to
   include here.  Many were supportive of SATAN as a sincere effort to
   improve security.  Several messages took offense to the anonymous
   author's choice of analogy.  Others were seriously annoyed at the mention
   of the National Rifle Association.  In these respects, your moderator
   regrets apparently being less than careful in his (im)moderation.  
   Sorry!  PGN]
