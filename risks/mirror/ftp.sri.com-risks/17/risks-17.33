Subject: Virtual reality damages vestibular-ocular reflex?

Electronic Engineering Times, 14 Aug 95, has an article entitled "Neural VOR
predicts illness." According to the article, "A complete model of the
vestibular-ocular reflex (VOR) was demonstrated here at the World Congress
on Neural Networks.  The neural-network-based model accurate mimics not only
the behavior of a VOR but the abnormal behavior of damaged VORs.
Separately, the author estimates that at least two months' exposure to
inaccurate virtual-reality simulations could damage health VORs."

Choose your interpretation... does this highlight a RISK of virtual reality,
or a RISK of drawing real-world conclusions from computer modelling?

Subject: Sony satellite dishes REMOTELY reprogrammable?

An article in the _Boston Globe_ 8 Sept 1995 mentioned that some Sony
miniature satellite dishes have a problem, the nature of which is that the
screen freezes and the audio drops for a second or two.  What raised my
eyebrows was a comment by a Sony official that the company is investigating
the possibility of downloading a fix into the dishes (the problem is
apparently software in nature, with the result being that the tuner doesn't
lock properly).  This would require no action on the part of users, and the
TV set (in the words of the article) would not need to be on when the fix
was downloaded for it to have effect.

If the official knew that this kind of remote reprogramming facility exists
(as opposed to this person being a PR flack just blowing smoke), well, the
possibilities may be left to the imaginations of my fellow RISKS readers.

Subject: Password cracking 'improves' security

The following extract is from an advertisement for a program called WDPass:

        Never lose your passwords again. For many organisations the
        major deterrent to using the security features in programs
        such as WordPerfect and Lotus 1-2-3 is the fear of
        rendering crucial files inaccessible by losing or
        forgetting passwords. It is logical to have an immediate
        solution to recovering passwords and enhancing security.

        WDPass can immediately recover lost passwords and, thus
        access locked files allowing users to feel secure in using
        passwords to lock confidential files.

        [Ingram Micro Services advertisement in September 1995 issue
        of Connectivity (a newsletter published by the PC User Group)]

The program claims to work for a variety of Wordperfect, Microsoft, Lotus
and Borland file formats. I find it hard to believe that anyone could read
this advert and think that buying a program that breaks the passwords on all
of their files will make the confidentiality of their data more secure, but
the risk is that out there are some senior executives gullible enough to
think that this allows them to rely entirely on password protection of
documents instead of more traditional locks and keys.

Subject: Viruses Plague Microsoft Programs (Edupage, 31 Aug 1995)

A strange virus is invading documents created with Microsoft's popular Word
program.  While it doesn't destroy files or cause serious damage, it changes
files into templates, which can then be awkward to work with or transfer.
Microsoft is distributing a fix that gets rid of the virus and inoculates
against future contamination, available though help lines or at <
http://www.microsoft.com >.  (Wall Street Journal 30 Aug 95 B2) Meanwhile,
some would-be Windows 95 users are complaining that they get stuck after the
first disk.  A Microsoft spokeswoman says that a virus already on the users'
computers is at fault -- when it's activated by the first Windows 95 disk,
it prevents any other disks from being installed.  Details on how to fix the
problem will be forthcoming, but meanwhile, users who install the program
via floppy disk should use a virus checker to scan their systems first and
set the write-protect tab on their program disks before installing them.

Subject: Word Macro virus, platform crossing, and VBA

In regard to the recent postings on the Word.Macro/WinWord.Concept virus by
Paul Ducklin, Gene Spafford and others, there are some related developments
of note.

As the postings have said, the concept of macro or interpreted viral
"programs" has been known, experimented with and theorized for some time.  A
major factor in the success of such a virus is a "critical mass" of
compatible systems.  For a time the Rexx language appeared to be poised on
the brink of "success" as a cross platform macro environment, and currently
there is interest in MIME (Multi-purpose Internet Mail Extensions).  Neither
of those systems, however, has yet become a major player.

By a quirk of chance I have recently reviewed a number of books on
Microsoft's Visual Basic.  All of them have mentioned Microsoft's move
towards Visual Basic for Applications, or VBA.  This is to be a fully
compatible programming/scripting/macro environment replacing and augmenting
the various macro functions in Microsoft products.  Once VBA is implemented,
a macro virus word not merely be able to spread from WinWord to MacWord
documents, but to Excel, Access, FoxPro and a host of other applications as
well.  Indeed, from the information in the books, Microsoft is interested in
licensing VBA to other developers for inclusion in non-MS applications.

Perhaps it's time to turn off the macro "autoload" capabilities in all
your applications?

   Mike Crawford, on the risks of Trojan horses in PostScript files.  PGN]

Subject: Re: Two Way HOV Lane (Weinstock, RISKS-17.30,32)

My colleague, Chuck Weinstock, recently reported to this forum a terrible
accident that happened here in Pittsburgh, PA, regarding a head-on collision
between two vehicles travelling in opposite directions on a high occupancy
vehicle (HOV) lane.  Several people were killed in this accident, and two
individuals remain hospitalized.  This HOV lane is supposedly only open in
one direction at a time.

There are three new developments in this incident, according to last night's
news:

1) There have been news reports of at least three other incidents of cars
travelling in both directions simultaneously in the HOV lane--three more
potential head-on crashes occurring just since the fatal accident last week.

2) An employee of the state department of transportation (PennDoT) who had
been responsible for manually opening and closing the gates and turning
on/off the signs to control access to the HOV lane was fired yesterday.  His
attorney reportedly admitted that he had opened the south end of the lane
before closing the north end (in violation of procedure) and then lied to
investigators by claiming that he had followed procedures.  There may be
criminal charges filed against the former PennDoT employee.

3) PennDoT reportedly is planning to spend a million dollars to upgrade the
control system and signage for this HOV lane.  According to the news
reports, it sounds like they are planning to put into a central location a
set of manually-operated switches to control the gates and signs, much as
they are manually controlled in the field by a single operator now.

IMHO, I'd have serious concerns about this sort of "automated" control
system coupled with the use of a manual checklist. The same potential
problem for human error or failure to follow the checklist could still
exist, if the appropriate safety mechanisms are not built in.  The only
difference is that the problem has now merely moved from the physical gate
and sign devices to a control panel in a central facility.  All one needs to
do is look at the prior literature on human error in control rooms to
validate this concern.

For example, in the nuclear power industry, estimates of human error (as a
percentage of system failures) range from twenty to sixty-five percent
[Moray88].  Within a particular type of system, operating power plants, 15
to 30% of reported events occurring during operation involved a human error
component [Griffon-Fouco87].  Of these events:

- --  approximately 80% occur during operation and periodic tests
- --  about 50% occur in the control room
- --  almost 40% of these errors are evidenced by inappropriate user 
	actions [Griffon-Fouco87].

Related studies [Meclot & Griffon-Fouco88] have indicated a number of deep
causes of these human failures.  Although sixty-two percent of the
significant incidents can be attributed to the ergonomics of the workplace
and the organization of the work, another fifty-six percent can be
attributed to failure to follow procedures (26%), content of procedures
(16%), task complexity (11%) and the form of the procedures (3%).

Taken from these prior studies, procedure following in a control room is
still far from perfect reliability--human error can still occur.  I hope
that PennDoT does more than just add in switches to manually control the HOV
lane, and also incorporates appropriate interlocks into their control room.

Johnson's earlier book, "Computer Ethics" (cf. BKCMPETH.RVW), may be considered
the preeminent work in the field.  This collection of papers, co-edited with
Nissenbaum, enhances, but does not extend, that prior work.
 
Ethical problems may be divided into a number of groups in the computer world. 
Three stand out in particular.  Some dilemmas arise from a conflict of agreed
"good" values.  These are the situations described in moral scenarios:  should
the poor man steal the medicine necessary to cure his wife from the inventor
who will not reduce his price.  A second class have to do with unknown or
unpredictable situations.  In the non-computer world, an example would be
megaprojects of unknown environmental impact.  The third grouping would include
situations where a vast majority hold to a certain standard of behaviour, while
a minority act otherwise.  Cults and certain brands of terrorism would fall
into this category.
 
Most non-computer ethical discussion is directed at the first class of
problems, and most works on morality in computing follow suit.  The articles in
this book go a bit further.  Chapter five, and parts of six and seven, raise
issues related to group two problems.  The ethical analysis is, however,
limited and tentative.  The inclusion of articles by Stallman, and Dorothy
Denning's interview with Frank Drake, would seem to be an attempt to discuss
the third type of issues.  The bulk of the work, though, speaks with a single
voice from the position of conventional morality, yet fails to address
realistically the problem of bringing outsiders into the fold.
 
The papers seem to have a fair distribution between academic and popular works. 
Be forewarned:  some of the latter have a Saturday-magazine level of accuracy
to the information.  Non-American readers should note a heavy reliance on
American case and constitutional law, although most discussions are
sufficiently detailed as to raise common law issues.

  Book: Software Assessment: Reliability, Safety, Testability
  Authors:  Michael A. Friedman & Jeffrey M. Voas
  Publisher:  John Wiley & Sons, New York (1-800-225-5945)
              ISBN 0-471-01009-X; Hardbound, $54.95

Is software quality testing really effective or just a waste of time?  The
skeptics conclude that it is an exercise in futility to try to measure the
reliability and safety of these complex systems under all critical
circumstances.  They contend that quality assurance comes only through a
strict adherence to rigorous development process models.  In this
groundbreaking book, Michael Friedman and Jeffrey Voas dispel that myth.
They demonstrate that extremely accurate, cost-effective software quality
testing can now be a reality, thanks to powerful new analytical tools.
Central to the approach outlined in Software Assessment is an assessment
optimization technique called testability analysis.  Pioneered at the
College of William and Mary and NASA by Jeffrey Voas, testability analysis
predicts the likelihood that latent bugs will be detected through testing.
Because no test oracle is required, testability analysis can be automated.
The book offers a balanced presentation of theory and practice.  Featuring
exhaustive coverage of the foundations of reliability, safety, and
testability, it uses real-world examples, illustrations, and clear
descriptions to explore all of the latest techniques for assessing those
qualities.
