Subject: Re: Backdoors, bugs, and Oracle [Identity withheld, RISKS-17.88]
 
On 9 March, an unidentified user posted a message concerning backdoors,
bugs, and Oracle7.  He mentioned a specific (security-relevant) bug that he
had reported through Oracle's normal bug reporting mechanisms and which
Oracle has subsequently fixed.
 
It is general - and prudent - security practice not to publish details of
security-relevant bugs, in order to protect exposed systems from potential
attack. In his rush to expose `backdoors and bugs,' The unidentified user
has irresponsibly put other Oracle7 customers - who may not have had a
chance to upgrade - at risk, while his systems are, of course, protected.
 
  (As a sidebar, many of his other comments were inaccurate - but a
  discussion of the reasons for this properly belongs on
  comp.databases.oracle rather than this forum.)
 
The RISK? That users who think they know a little about security can, by
posting before thinking, create or magnify the threat they are allegedly
trumpeting against.

Subject: Errors in W2s and other tax forms

I recently got a call from a friend where I used to work (The MITRE
Corporation).  MITRE recently "re-engineered" their financial systems.  It
turns out that these "new and improved" systems mis-printed the W2 forms
(U.S. tax form showing earnings and tax withholdings.  Up here in Canada we
call it a T-4 form, eh?)  The employer ID number was printed incorrectly.
It should start with a leading zero, but this zero was suppressed, leaving
the employer ID with the wrong number of digits.

MITRE made a quiet announcement about this problem in its weekly news
bulletin, and it was only through a phone call from a friend still there
that I found out about this problem.

My mother recently had a problem with a IRS 1099, which mistakenly reported
tax-exempt interest income as taxable.  She was lucky to catch the mistake.
Otherwise, she would have received a dunning letter from the IRS assessing
taxes and penalties and requiring lots of back-and-forth to rectify the
mistake.  (Been there, done that...)

The MITRE incident raises two questions, one technical and one social.

Technically, the problem with the mis-printed number is the distinction
between "radix numbers" (e.g. Federal Employer ID number, Social Security
Number) which are required to have a fixed number of digits, and where the
leading zero is significant, and "cardinal numbers", where the leading zero
can (and usually should) be suppressed.  Of course, COBOL gets this exactly
right, with two different format strings (9 and Z).  But other languages
don't make this clear distinction, and I suspect that the MITRE system was
not written in COBOL...  (I shudder to think what it WAS written in.  There
are lots of horror stories about the failure of this system...)

The other issue concerns the employer's responsibility to report errors on
computer-generated forms, to both the IRS and to the former employee.  I
think that publishing a "by-the-way" notice in the company newsletter is NOT
a sufficient response to errors on a legal document.  (If anyone thinks that
a W2 is not a legal document, good luck arguing this with the IRS!)

The unfortunate thing about computers is that it's so easy to replicate
mistakes.  (Reminds me of the ``Dear Rich Bastard'' letters...)

Subject: Music, nonstop!

As I sat reading the latest RISKS, the local Radio Station here announced
that their computer is down, so they won't be playing any advertisements --
just music all afternoon.  Apparently all the adverts are now kept as
digitised files on the computer rather than on "carts" as they formerly
were.  I'm sure there's a "risk" in this story somewhere, but I'm not
exactly sure what it is.

  [Count your blessings, not your adverts.  
  But it is amazing that they could not ``Ad lib''!
  Most stations keep manual backup copies or readable hardcopies 
  for just such situations -- they hate to lose ad revenue.
  But, I hope this outage was not blamed on a home-grown
  compiler, so that we can conclude that
    ``The key, we see, is not the KiWi-C.''  PGN]

From: Mark Rafn <dagon@halcyon.com>
Subject: Stupid ftpd messages

Has anyone else been surprised by an FTP server, when it denies access
because of too many users, affirming that the user-count isn't a bug?

For example, the ftp.adobe.com site gives the following message:
# Sorry, there are too many anonymous FTP users 
#   using ftp.adobe.com at this time.
# There is currently a limit of 90 anonymous users.
# This message is not the result of a bug. 

What is the purpose of the last line?  I can't imagine that it's actually
somehow checking number of users in more than one way, and only generating
the "not a bug" comment when both methods match (and therefore generating a
"this might be a bug" message if there's a discrepancy).  All I can think of
is that someone once reported a bug which turned out not to be a bug and the
comment was put there to prevent more non-bug reports when the server's busy.

The risks are somewhat obvious, although minor.  If there *is* a bug, it'll
take longer to find and fix, because it's clearly labelled "not a bug", so
it won't get reported as soon or often.  I think there's also a risk in the
programmer attitude that erroneous bug reports can be best prevented by such
disclaimers - I'd much prefer that an informative sentence (such as "it's
not uncommon to see 300 users or more trying to access this site") be
displayed than a condescending and difficult-to-believe "this is not a bug".

Subject: Ironic risks on ATM story

	Here I am, watching the Discovery Channel.  There's this show called
"Invention", which has this interesting story about Automated Teller
Machines.  On the show they have the Scottish inventor of the ATM, Shephard
Barron (I probably have the spelling wrong).  They go and introduce him and
show him walking down the street of his home town, and him walking up to an
ATM and in plain sight you see him insert his card and TYPE IN HIS PIN!
	If that weren't ironic enough, later on in the story you hear him
talk about how he had some buddies at MI6 try to break the system.  (they
couldn't)
	You also got to see at least one other "person off the street"
demonstrate the ATM and his poor PIN is seen typed in in plain view.  (in
closeup this time!)
	The risk?  Shows like this only reinforce people's ignorance of how
important it is to keep PINs private.

Subject: Risks of using an insecure browser, as discussed on RISKS

I am having a really difficult time working up much sympathy for the folks
who complained in RISKS about the html "mailto:" code getting triggered:
Netscape 2.0's security flaws have been widely noted.  But I find it very
interesting that RISKS readers, who ought to know better, are still using a
browser with known security problems.  (Netscape 2.01, which has been out
for a week or so, has plugged this particular hole, and allows you to turn
off Javascript altogether).

For all the complaints decrying the ignorance of "those people out there
still running unsecure sendmail, etc.", we find that even those that "know
better" still do the same thing.  Of course, like the majority of drivers
who think that they are the minority of very good drivers, RISKS readers
probably think that "they know what they are doing".

==Doug Claar

     [Besides, Netscape is paying good money to folks who are helping 
     them find new flaws!  Sounds like a constructive strategy,
     considering how difficult it is to solve the security problem,
     especially in the presence of Trojan horses!  PGN]

Subject: Reminder: Computers, Freedom and Privacy '96, 27-30 March 1996

On March 27-30, MIT (and its Laboratory for Computer Science, together with
the World Wide Web Consortium) will host the Sixth Conference on Computers
Freedom and Privacy (CFP).  Since its inception in 1991, the series of CFP
conferences has been the premiere forum for exploring the implications of
computer and telecommunication technologies for privacy and civil liberties.
This year's conference brings together international experts from the fields
of computer science, law, business, public policy, law enforcement, and
government to confront controversial issues that have dominated public
discussions of computer communications policy over the past year.

Highlights of the conference include

- The Constitutional challenge to the Communications Decency Act. Computer
companies, internet service providers, publishing and library associations,
and civil liberties groups have filed suit in Federal court to overturn the
Communications Decency Act of 1996 on the grounds that it violates the First
Amendment.  A judgment is expected in April.  One basis for the challenge is
the existence of less restrictive means to protect children from indecent
material on-line, including filtering software developed at the MIT Lab for
Computer Science.  At the conference, lawyers involved in the ongoing suit
will discuss the progress of the suit and analyze the Constitutional
arguments raised in briefs by the challengers and by the Department of
Justice.

- Limiting on-line speech on campus.  Harvard Law School's Arthur Miller
will moderate a panel of university administrators, lawyers, and journalists
to explore the conflicts between universities and the free-speech rights of
their students.

- Can the US government outlaw unauthorized encryption?  In cooperation with
the Criminal Justice Section of the American Bar Association, the conference
will present a moot Court hearing on the Constitutionality of a proposed law
that criminalizes the use of encryption methods that have not been
authorized by the government.  The arguments, which pit former federal
prosecutors against noted civil liberties lawyers, will be conducted before
a distinguished panel of federal appellate and district court judges.

- China and the Internet.  The Chinese expression "may you live in
interesting times" clearly applies to issues of computers and society as the
Internet spreads explosively throughout China and the rest of Asia.
Sociologist Gary Marx and a panel that includes officials of the China
Education and Research Network (CERNET) discuss the likely social impacts of
the Internet on China.

- Export-controlled encryption software on the Internet.  Jeff Schiller,
Manager of the MIT Network, and Ron Lee, General Counsel of the National
Security Agency, will describe the legal and technical procedures to be
followed in distributing software over the Internet in compliance with US
export controls.

- FBI/DOJ law-enforcement training on computer crime.  On the afternoon of
March 27th, Peter Toren of the US Department of Justice Computer Crime Unit
and Richard Ress, Head of the FBI's National Computer Crime Squad, will run
a training session devoted to crime and law in cyberspace.  Admission to
this tutorial will be free for law-enforcement personnel, so long as they
pre-register.  (Qualified law-enforcement personnel should phone
617/253-1700 for information.)

- George Metakides, Director of Research and Development in Information
Technologies for the European Union, will present a keynote address on
Freedom and Privacy in the Information Age: A European Perspective.

- Michael Dertouzos, Director of the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science,
will deliver a banquet speech on "Ancient Humans in the Information Age".

- A free-admission, all-day "Technology Fair" on March 27 will include
hands-on demonstrations of computer technologies affecting freedom and
privacy.

- Noted privacy advocate Marc Rotenberg and a panel of international experts
will discuss the roles of governments and technology in dealing with data
privacy in the Global Information Infrastructure.

- What policies and regulations are under consideration for the
international control of cryptography?  How does a multinational company
meet those requirements?  How do we resolve tensions between countries,
between governments and industries, and between governments and popular
groups?  Dorothy Denning of Georgetown University, Deborah Hurley of the
OECD, Chairman David Herson of the European Commission's Senior Advisor
Group on Information Systems, Nick Mansfield of Shell, and White House
Special Assistant on Information Technology Mike Nelson examine the issues.

- The struggle to control controversial content on the Internet is being
waged in the the US Congress and in open and restrictive societies around
the world.  Will conflicts among governments over what and how to censor
restrict the flow of ideas for all?  Moderator Danny Weitzner of the
Washington-based Center for Democracy and Technology and an international
panel will offer their views.

- Representatives of business, banking, and law enforcement look at the
future of Electronic Money.  Should on-line payments be anonymous or
traceable?  David Chaum of DigiCash, the American Bankers Association's
Kawika Daguio, and Stan Morris of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network
(FINCEN) will compare different perspectives.

- Will copyright law be an enabler of freedom of expression in digital
networked environments or will it be an impediment to free speech?  Does
digitizing information so fundamentally change the economics of creating and
disseminating information products as to render copyright law obsolete?
Pamela Samuelson of Cornell Law School will explore this topic with and
international panel of copyright experts.

- Science fiction authors Pat Cadigan, Tom Maddox, Bruce Sterling, and
Vernor Vinge will present their unique perspectives on the future of freedom
and privacy in an increasingly computerized world.

Subject: Re: jury duty (Bruhin, RISKS-17.91)

> Emily is only 8 years old and, therefore, is not *eligible* for jury duty...

I'm guessing there's more to it than this.  As far as I know, all potential
juror names are pulled from some known pool.  Traditionally, the list of
registered voters was used.  Some areas are now using lists of licensed
drivers.  Either pool would yield people of the proper age.  The last time I
served at the county level here in Pennsylvania I was pulled from the list
of registered voters.  However, we were told that licensed drivers would be
used in the near future to get a larger pool and not discourage people from
voting to avoid their "other" civic duty.  I don't know if this sort of
decision is typically made at the state or local level.

No comment on WPVI.  But if you're in Philly and it snows, you can 
turn to Channel 6 to see every flake.

Subject: Re: FTC Targets Internet Fraud (Edupage, 17 March 1996)

The *SJ Mercury* article about this had a bit more information. Near the end
of the article they listed just what it was that the FTC found in its first
busts. The scams had nothing to do with the Internet: they were the same
kinds of scams you see flyers for on non-computer bulletin boards and the
classified ads of most newspapers (credit history fixing and so on).

The RISK here is that people tacking the word "Internet" onto the job they
are already doing makes the job sound more important and the Internet more
dangerous than the rest of the world. In this case, neither are true.

Subject: More on Iomega stock volatility (Re: Edupage, RISKS-17.91)

: ... postings on Motley Fool and other BBSs have contained false information

This is speculative and misleading.  No one has demonstrated that online
discussion influences the price of a stock.  Companies often complain to the
SEC about alleged manipulation; such complaints, in my experience, are
usually spurious, as there are no adverse consequences to the company from
making unfounded claims.

Share prices go up or down primarily on the decisions of mutual fund
managers, who don't have the time or inclination to read newsgroups.  The
amount of capital controlled by Internet users is minuscule compared to the
$1+ trillion in equity mutual funds.

Subject: Re: Hare Krsna chants trigger answering machine (Cross, RISKS-17.91)

Concerning the attempt to record Hare Krishna chants on a telephone
answering machine...

When Ma Bell invented touch tone dialing it was quite reasonable to choose
frequencies that fall within the range of the human voice -- after all, all
the equipment was and still is optimized for that range.  It was many years
before anyone tried detecting these "DTMF" tones in a context where a person
would be speaking.  It is difficult to avoid false detection of DTMF tones
in human speech.  Of course, if the telephone answering machine industry had
waited around for the development of "out of band" signalling systems such
as ISDN, a multi-billion dollar industry would never have gotten off the
ground.

Subject: Re: Hare Krsna chants trigger answering machine (Cross, RISKS-17.91)

Voice activation of tone-detection equipment is a long standing issue with
voice mail/answering machine systems.  The problem has been significantly
alleviated by the transition from analog circuitry to digital signal
analysis, but some voices still register as one or another DTMF signal.
Fortunately, digital signal analysis has eliminated the far more annoying
problem of the recorded message triggering tone detection when it is played
back.  If the expected signal may be both quite brief and the margin of
error is wide (to accommodate some PBX systems which generate fixed length
and remarkably dirty tones), a wide variety of voices may cause a problem.

For the record, my answering machine thinks that Lisa Kudrow and Chrissie
Hynde singing harmony on "Smelly Cat" sounds like a DTMF * (end-of-message
indicator).  Or maybe it just has taste...

From: "Rapalus, Patrice" <prapalus@mfi.com>
Subject: Call for Papers -- CSI 23rd Annual Conference

The Computer Security Institute invites you to submit an abstract of a
proposed topic to be considered for presentation at the 1996 23nd Annual
Computer Security Conference, November 11-13, in Chicago.

We are looking for presentations on the following possible topics: access
control, electronic commerce, remote access security, Internet,
cryptography, risk management, business continuity planning, security
awareness, telecommunications security, network architecture, wireless
network security, LANs, WANs, management issues, network viruses,
client/server systems, single sign-on, imaging, privacy issues and e-mail.

We are particularly interested in case studies -- in-depth practical
discussions of network-related security projects, problems, and solutions
for the real world.

Next year's conference will offer approximately 120 scheduled sessions.
Faculty are intended to address a broad range of experiences, expertise and
interest in networks and related security issues. Sessions generally run one
hour and fifteen minutes. Double sessions are scheduled if warranted by the
topic. If your abstract is selected, you are required to provide a paper for
inclusion in the proceedings.

Applicability to Attendees
The proposed presentation should offer successful concepts, models, processes 
and applications useful to those responsible for information security.

Innovation/Originality
A presentation that advances existing or presents new ideas is better than a
presentation that merely repeats information already widely known. The
timeliness of ideas is important. A presentation designed to sell a name
product or service will be rejected. A presentation should focus on the
general attributions, benefits and drawbacks of a given application or tool.

Some general guidelines
Courses that offer tips and techniques to increase productivity, in addition
to theory, are much more valuable. Sessions on novel and unique applications
of products and tools are good but keep in mind that emphasis on a single
product can limit the scope of appeal for the class. Case studies of
computer security projects, problems and solutions are very popular.

To ensure a wide variety of perspectives, no more than three principal
speakers per organization will be allowed to present at the conference.
Papers presented at other computer security conferences will be disqualified
unless they contain substantial new or updated information.

The Submission Process
To be eligible for selection as a speaker, you will need to submit an
abstract that describes the content of your talk(s), a biography that
describes your background, and complete contact information including your
e-mail address and fax numbers. We must receive your submissions by April
15, 1996 to be considered. Please include any scheduling conflicts you have
as well.

The abstract should be approximately 200-300 words (8-10 sentences), and
classified by the presenter as entry-level, intermediate or advanced. Please
provide 3-6 "bullet points" telling us what attendees will learn from your
session. Indicate any special prerequisite knowledge required of
participants and emphasize what attendees will learn.

We prefer to receive submissions electronically. E-mail should be sent to
prapalus @mfi.com. Upload to the CSI BBS at 415/905-2480.  Abstracts can
also be mailed to CSI, 600 Harrison St. San Francisco, CA 94107 or faxed to
415-905- 2218. For more information, please call Patrice Rapalus at
415-905-2310.

Speakers receive complimentary registration for the 2-1/2 day conference and 
attendance at all lunches and receptions.
