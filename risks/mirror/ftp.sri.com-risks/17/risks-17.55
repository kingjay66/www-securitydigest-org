Subject: NY Stock Exchange halted for one hour this morning

Tomorrow's papers will undoubtedly have some coverage on the the NY Stock
Exchange, which opened an hour late this morning.  From what I can glean
from various preliminary sources, the weekend had been spent upgrading the
system software.  However, at 9:15 this morning, it was discovered that
there were serious communications problems in the software between the
central computing facility and the specialists' displays.  The problem was
diagnosed and fixed by 10:00am, and the market reopened at 10:30.  It was
the first time since 27 December 1990 that the exchange had to shut down.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Boston Stock Exchange, and Philadelphia
Stock Exchange all waited until the NYSE opened as well.

Subject: Laser Shows and Aircraft

An article on the Dow-Jones news service (which I presume means that it is
also in the Wall Street Journal) discusses the risks of display lasers
(mostly used instead of the old carbon-arc spotlights to call attention to a
place) co-existing with aviation.  Some of the interesting tidbits:

. The Luxor in Las Vegas has a beam which reflects off of a waterfall.  When
  the water pressure of the fall weakens, the reflections cause problems for
  the nearby airport.  A check valve has been installed to shut the beams 
  down when the water pressure drops too low.

. A McDonnell Douglas study found that 45% of participants crashed a flight
  simulator when exposed to a laser beam while making a turn.

. Several incidents of laser blinding have been reported by pilots.  Example:
  A pilot for Southwest Airlines, took off from Las Vegas's McCarran
  International Airport. About three miles into the flight he was blinded by
  a flash of brilliant light, requiring his fellow pilot to grab the controls.

. The FDA has ordered a halt to laser light shows within 20 miles of any Las
  Vegas airport as a result of such incidents.

. The Las Vegas Hilton has installed TCAS(!) - Traffic Collision Avoidance
  System which will shut off its lasers if it senses any type of aircraft in
  their path.  But the system is unreliable with aircraft below 1,200 feet.

This reminds me that laser blinding played an important role in a recent Tom
Clancy novel.

Subject:  Electronic food stamps failure

An old risk repeated: The December 15 issue of the Fort Worth (Texas)
Star-Telegram reports that the computers used for tracking food stamps in
Texas failed, and some merchants were unable to accept cards.  The system
normally processes 350,000 transactions per day.  For some reason (not
explained in the article), only some of the 14,000 retailers who accept the
card were affected.  As of when the article was published, the computers had
been out for about a day, and the problem was not yet fixed.

Subject: Timing cryptanalysis and its hardware analog

Paul Kocher's announcement in RISKS-17.54 about timing attacks to find
secret keys reminds me of an analogous (and analog) attack that can be made
on chip cards.

Since chip cards can fall into attackers' hands, not only must the
encryption algorithms run in a fixed and independent amount of time, but the
hardware must consume a fixed and independent amount of power for all
branches through the critical code.  Attackers have been known to use
sensitive measurements of the current drawn during the authentication phase
to determine keys.

Timing attacks can be based on apparent optimizations in software
multiplication of long numbers.

Current (amp) attacks can even be used against single-cycle multiplications,
if the hardware designers are not careful.

"Softies" might be surprised by what the hardware reveals about their code
and data.

Subject: Invitation to the CFP'96 Technology Fair

Many RISKS readers are familiar with the annual conference on Computers,
Freedom and Privacy. For those of you who are not, CFP is the leading
conference exploring issues having to deal with the complex interactions of
computers, privacy, and our legal system. Past conferences have been heavily
attended by law enforcement, academics, and journalists, has been a place
where people on different sides of complex issues such as national
cryptography policy can get together and talk things out. This year's
conference sponsored, in part, by the National Science Foundation, the John
D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, America Online, IBM, News Corp,
and the Freedom Forum First Amendment Center. You can get more information
about CFP at http://web.mit.edu/cfp96

This year, CFP will be having a technology fair. I am one of the people who
is putting the fair together.

We are looking for companies and individuals who are interested in
exhibiting. We have identified the following key areas that we are
interested in:

People to invite for the technology fair:

* Internet Filtering Technology
* Voice and Data Encryption
* Smart Cards
* Secure Payment Systems
* Public Access Internet
* Personal Dossiers Building Technology
* Crime Tracking
* Internet Monitoring & Marketing

The fair will be on Wednesday, the 27th of March. It will be open to the
public, and there will be no admission charge. We estimate that there will
be at least 400 attendees form the conference, plus another 1000 from the
MIT and surrounding Boston/Cambridge high-tech community. We can provide you
with a table and electricity, plus a connection to the Internet, if that
would be useful.

If you are interested in exhibiting at the fair, please send mail to me
(simsong@vineyard.net) or to cfp96@mit.edu

Subject: "netfuture" announcement

O'Reilly & Associates    101 RT. 21C  Ghent, New York 12075  1-518-672-5103

    WHAT TO DO WHILE WAITING FOR THE NEXT WAVE OF INTERNET BACKLASH

O'Reilly & Associates is establishing the "netfuture" mailing list.  This is
a moderated list to which O'Reilly editor, Steve Talbott, will post
approximately weekly pieces concerning high-technology trends in relation to
individual responsibility.  Some of these pieces will be selections from his
own forthcoming collection of provocations, "Daily Meditations for the
Computer-entranced."

Technology and the Net: Who Is Responsible?

The "netfuture" list will have a focus similar to the well-known and
estimable comp.risks newsgroup, with this difference:  "netfuture" will
look beyond the generally recognized issues such as privacy, access, and
dangerous computer glitches, seeking especially to address those deep
levels at which we half-consciously shape technology and are shaped by
it.  What is half-conscious can, after all, be made fully conscious, and
can become material for public discussion and policy-making.  As we wait
for the second wave of Internet backlash, what better to do than try to
understand the forces that have propelled the Net so dramatically onto
center stage amid near worship on the one hand, and (among a few)
something more like dread?

Once "netfuture" is under way, a companion, unmoderated discussion list
may be launched, based on the advice of participants.

Steve Talbott is author of "The Future Does Not Compute -- Transcending the
Machines in Our Midst," currently available from O'Reilly & Associates.

To subscribe to the "netfuture" mailing list, address an e-mail message to:

    listproc@online.ora.com

No "Subject" is needed.  The first line in the body of your message should
read like this (but with your name substituted for "John Doe"):

    subscribe netfuture John Doe

Within the next day or so (usually much sooner) you should get a reply
message welcoming you to the list and explaining how to participate.  If you
don't get the initial reply, or if you have other problems or questions,
please send e-mail to: netfuture-owner@online.ora.com -- tell us when you
sent your message and include your telephone number.

If you have more than one computer account or read e-mail on several
different services, be sure to send your subscription request from the place
where you want to read "netfuture". Our system automatically reads your
e-mail address from your subscription-message and registers you at that
particular address.

  [If your FROM: address is different from your desired address,
  you'd better complain to Steve directly.  I suggested they should
  fix that problem, or at least respect the REPLY-TO field, but apparently
  they can't.  It is extraordinary how much mail I get with FROM: 
  addresses to which I cannot answer.  PGN]

Subject: Taxing data (Re: Alvarez, RISKS-17.54)

I recently became victim of a virus that erased the FAT on my hard disc.
Because my most recent backup was about three weeks old (highlighting
another well-known RISK), I was obliged to seek the services of a data
recovery company.

After the work was done, the bill included a charge for sales tax.  It was
explained to me that sales tax must be collected because of the process
involved, to wit: they salvaged the data (minus FAT) from my hard drive and
saved it temporarily on another drive.  After reformatting my hard drive,
they reconstructed the FAT and copied the data back again.  The fact that
they placed "new" data on an empty hard drive is what triggers the sales
tax.  (I'm in California.)

Subject: Re: Something funny about the funny pages item (Alvarez, RISKS-17.54)

RISKS-17.54 had a short mention about an NPR piece on IRS policies on taxing
cartoonists. I didn't hear that piece, but the description in RISKS cannot
be correct. Sales tax is a state thing, not from the IRS. There is an issue
right now concerning the California State Board of Equalization's attempts
to collect sales tax on printed comic book original pages, which may be what
was mentioned on NPR. Since the BOE is trying to tax the sale of the
documents (claiming that they are commercial illustrations and taxable and
not author's literary manuscripts, which are not), it is the case that
transmitting cartoons electronically may not be taxable. The only reference
to this I have found on the net doesn't say much, but see
http://www.insv.com/cbldf/cases.html under the heading "San Francisco,
California". That's a page at the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund web site,
home page http://www.insv.com/cbldf/

Paranoia is an occupational disease in the computer security business.
I try to watch out for it myself...

You are automatically allocated an anonymous account if you ever send mail
to someone else's anonymous account.  You can do this directly, or
indirectly via a mailing list -- if an anonymous account is a subscriber,
even indirectly, the mail to them will be routed through penet -- and you'll
get your own id.

Now -- a few years ago, and possibly still, there were some attacks aimed at
discovering who owned which anonymous ids.  There are, after all, people who
want to know who posts to alt.sex.gerbils or the like -- think of your
favorite extremist politician.

		--Steve Bellovin

    [The automatic enrollment was noted by a score of respondents!
    RISKS was also swamped with war stories of previous spoofings of .fi,
    often using forged e-mail.  Apparently, anon.penet.fi now requires
    passwords (which themselves are spoofable).  And don't forget that
    monitoring incoming traffic and outgoing traffic can enable someone
    to identify the [apparent] sender's FROM: address unless multiple  
    layers of anonymity are used.  Or you can be tricked into answering
    a message that can reveal YOUR identity!  Or any of several other
    horrible risks.  Perhaps we need a comp.risks.anonymous.  
    Caveat emptor.  Beware of Anonymous Bosch.

    By the way, several Unix-centric folks also noted that ls -lu 
    shows the time most recently read (well, to a first approximation, 
    anyway), but neglected to note that can be tampered with also!  PGN]

Subject: Re: Classified Disks Lost--Court Martial (Kennedy, RISKS-17.54)

A "Severe reprimand" in the Royal Navy is something that will remain on the
service records of those two officers and will continue to be held against
them for the rest of their careers. The nature of the data lost should also
be taken into account when considering the severity of their punishment;
they were returning to their unit after having given a presentation on wages
- the data was therefore more likely to be of a personal confidential nature
rather than a more serious threat to UK security. If however they had just
attended a presentation on the latest thing in Communications Security I'm
sure that the punishments would have been a little more severe. (But that
still asks the question, what were they doing in a pub with sensitive
data?).

As regards the apparent lack of exposure to classified material claimed by
one of the officers, I find this quite believable. Instructor Officers, as
their title implies, are specialist instructors and would not usually be as
used to handling secure information as their colleagues.

As a military man, Dave knows that a "severe reprimand" can ruin an
officer's career - especially at the Commander level.  If they were in the
Royal Navy - the article does not say so specifically - they will have
"incurred Their Lordship's displeasure" - now THAT is a bad thing !  As for
the embarrassment, let the punishment fit the crime - Their Lordships were
severely embarrassed...  Peter Horsburgh zawlhpvh@ibmmail.com

Something I've noticed in the use of British and American language is that
the British make an art out of understatement.  So, having your head bashed
by an iron bar during a robbery becomes "creating an affray while committing
a criminal act" and actually killing someone is "a breach of the peace" (!)

                       Widespread Attacks on Internet Sites

Over the last several weeks, the CERT Coordination Center has been working
on a set of incidents in which the intruders have launched widespread
attacks against Internet sites. Hundreds of sites have been attacked, and
many of the attacks have been successful, resulting in root compromises at
the targeted sites. We continue to receive reports, and we believe that more
attacks are going undetected.

  **********************************************************************
  All the vulnerabilities exploited in these attacks are known, and are
  addressed by CERT advisories (see Section III).
  **********************************************************************

We urge everyone to obtain these advisories and take action to ensure that
