Subject: Spelling Correctors Self-Applied? Not in Microsoft Word

A cute article by Joan E. Rigdon in the *San Francisco Sunday Examiner and
Chronicle* Computers & Technology section (``How do you spell dated?  MS
Word hasn't brought dictionary into cyber-age'' -- 26 Nov 1995, B-5) points
out that the Word spellchecker makes the following suggestions for words
that putatively would seem important to Microsoft:

   Internet      --> interment
   Internet's    --> internee's
   e-mail        --> emboli (blood clots)
   cybershoppers --> [no suggestions]
   Netscape      --> [no suggestions, although pretending that your
                     competitors don't exist is a nasty strategy.

Ms. Rigdon also notes that Microsoft should have received adequate warning
last December when the *Dallas Morning News* ran a garbled story resulting
from an editor accidentally accepting all of the alternative spellings,
including the following conversions:

   Intel         --> Until         
   Microsoft     --> Microvolts

As noted in RISKS on numerous occasions, our archives are full of such
transgressions (most recently, see RISKS-17.32).  [Transgreshams Law,
I suppose.]  Similar to MS ignoring Netscape was Scott Siege's item in 
RISKS-15.72 that the Apple MacIntosh spellchecker suggested changing 
"Laserwriter" to "Laserjet" (not surprisingly, an Apple product).

Subject: Another Oakland airport radar outage

The Oakland airport radar failed again on 28 Nov 1995 for about two hours,
beginning at 9:44am.  ("The cause ... was not known.")  Backup radar at
Moffett Field was used; however, it covers a smaller area, and delays were
incurred on 17 takeoffs at SFO.  There had also been a brief failure on 27
Nov 1995, but it caused no disruption.  Usual statements were made about how
safety was not impaired and no one should be concerned.  FAA spokesman Mitch
Barker said, "We don't let it operate if it's not safe."  He was also quoted
in a made-for-RISKS statement: "Things are going to go wrong from time to
time, especially with a system as complicated as this."

[Source: *San Francisco Chronicle*, 29 Nov 1995, A13.  For further
background, the August 1995 Fremont (Oakland) ATC outage is discussed
beginning in RISKS-17.24 to 28.  Another Fremont outage earlier this month
required the backup system to be used for two days, but was not reported in
RISKS at the time.  Other ATC problems are also noted in recent RISKS -- in
Chicago (17.35) and Las Vegas (17.41).  The system may be safe, but it does
not seem sound.]

Subject: "Black Baron" gets 18-month sentence for virus activities

Christopher Pile, 26, the first person in Britain to be convicted of
creating computer viruses, was jailed for 18 months.  His creations
(Pathogen and Queeg) were apparently rather sophisticated stealth 
viruses that used an encryption program (Smeg) to hide their presence.

Subject: Denial-of-service attack

According to a front-page story by James W. Roberts in the 29 Nov 1995
_Asbury Park Press_ (NJ), a student at Monmouth University has been charged
with disrupting the school's electronic mail system for five hours by
bombarding two adminstrators with 24,000 e-mail messages.  The student's
computer access had been terminated on 9 Nov 1995 because of posting
advertising and business venture solicitations to "inappropriate sections of
the Internet" (presumably, Usenet groups).

It took 44 hours to trace the source of the attack through a service
provider in Atlanta, GA and back to an account based in Red Bank, NJ, shared
by the student.  The student is being charge with a federal crime because of
using interstate communication to deny service.  Carl Stern of the Justice
Department is said to have remarked that this is the first time the federal
computer fraud act has been used for an act of this type.

Subject: New software that is just too clever

Ray Panko's story of being outsmarted by Excel trying to be clever in
dealing with percentages reminded me of my recent struggles with WordPerfect
6.1.

I recently started using WordPerfect 6.1, upgrading from 5.2.  It  
has some nice features, but several strange things happened:

- I couldn't leave two spaces between a chapter number and the chapter name:
I would type two spaces but one would mysteriously disappear

- typing (c) in a list (as in (a), (b), (c)), resulted in the copyright
symbol appearing.  There was no warning - in fact a document converted from
WP5.2 had to be recalled and reprinted when we noticed this change.

- I could not select part of a word with the mouse: only all of it or none
of it.

After a lot of aggravation, and buying a couple of books, I found that the
strange behaviour resulted from "enhancements" in WP6.1.  I've now disabled
the enhancements, so the software will do what _I_ want.

Subject: Alarm and alarm-silencing risks in medical equipment

I recently underwent total hip replacement surgery.  As part of the
procedure, for pain control, the doctors fitted me with an intravenous 
infusion system that gave me a continuous morphine feed in fluids at a 
constant rate.  The system used two intravenous infusion (IV) pumps, one to
feed the morphine into the carrier fluids (a potassium salt solution, I
think), and the other to feed the carrier fluids into me.  Both pumps were
capable of operation from AC line or from internal rechargeable batteries;
this allows the patient to be transferred from the surgical suite to the
various other wards of the hospital without worrying about extension cords
on the way.  The pumps have an audible alarm, and there are several 
illuminated icons on the front panel to indicate the reason for the alarm.

Morphine is a controlled narcotic, and IV pumps for morphine have a number
of special features.  The morphine is carried in a large syringe that is
mounted inside the pump, behind a locking panel cover.  The programming
controls for the pump are behind the locking panel as well; the pump cannot
be set up or reset without the key.  There is a patient-operated demand
switch, with an associated programmable lockout time, that allows the
patient to get an extra boost on demand, but no more often than the certain
interval.  The patient is expected to use the switch if he anticipates a
need for more pain control than the baseline; this happens for example when
the patient is transferred between beds, or when the physical therapists
enter the room.  (The physical therapists do a very necessary job that is
unfortunately not a whole lot of fun for the patient.)  Additionally, the
physician will generally allow the patient to request an additional booster
dose from the nurse, at longer intervals.

Because of other medical concerns, I spent the first 24 hours or so post-op
in intensive care, rather than going immediately to the orthopedic floor.
When we transferred me up to orthopedic, the ICU nurses rearranged everything,
loaded the pumps onto a conventional IV tree, switched them over to battery
operation, and we were on our way.

Transferring a patient from an ICU bed/gurney to a standard hospital bed is
something of a production, requiring several nurses to lift and a patient
not to scream.  Then all the various hoses coming out of the patient have to
be arranged, the IV pumps situated, power cords plugged in, and etc. etc.

About an hour after the transfer to orthopedic was completed, one of the
IV pumps alarmed.  I called the nurse's station and told them "alarm on the
IV pump".  I couldn't see the pump face to see which alarm indicator was on.
A nurse, not the one assigned to me, came in, said, "Oh, that is just the
battery alarm; you don't have to listen to that; I'll silence it."  She did
something on the front panel of the morphine pump, and the alarm stopped.
I asked whether the pumps were in fact plugged in; she glanced at the
power cords and said they were.

A few minutes later, the assigned nurse came in, just as I was starting to
notice discomfort building up.  She asked about the alarm; I explained; she
checked the morphine pump, and discovered that it had just shut down from 
battery exhaustion.  She had to go get the patient chart and the safety key
and reprogram the pump, after plugging it into the wall.

The risks in the above design should be evident.  1) There should be an
unequivocal indication, continuously present, that the pump is running on
batteries.  2) There should be no operator procedure, other than getting the
pump running on AC line power, or shutting it off completely, to silence a
low-battery alarm.  3) Personnel have to be trained to think about WHY a
particular alarm is sounding, and the implications of the alarm, BEFORE they
reach for a "Silence" key.

Subject: Re: Can you have enough backups? (Cushman, RISKS-17.48)

The story from <M.Cushman@lse.ac.uk> about multiple failures of back-ups in
RISKS-17.48 reminded me of a somewhat similar incident which I perpetrated
many years ago while working in the Service Programming Department at ICL in
Stevenage.

The main programming effort was concentrated in the Executive Programming
Department. (The basic operating system on the ICL 1900 series was referred
to as an "executive". There was a more powerful operating system known as
GEORGE 3, but this ran on the larger machines in the range. Stevenage was
responsible for medium range machines which ran executives. I still think
that if ICL had played its cards right, GEORGE 3 could now have been a
serious rival to UNIX, but that is a separate story! :-)

Anyway, one task of Service Programming (as well as writing and maintaining
editors, assemblers and various utility programs) was to keep back-ups of
the source programs. The "executive masters", which were sources from which
a compiled executive for any hardware configuration could be derived, were
big beasts. The back-up involved running a disk-to-tape copy program, using
a grandparent-parent-child cycle of three pairs of tapes. If a pair of tapes
became full, the administrator (me) had literally to go from desk to desk
and persuade people to delete their out-of-date sources to make room for the
latest ones.

My job included reading the printed operator's log every morning to check
that the previous overnight back-up run was OK, and in particular that it
had not overflowed the two tapes. Came the day when I had neglected to do
this check for a while, and discovered that three nights previously, the
back-up had overflowed. All three generations of back-up MT had been
overwritten with a truncated copy!

Worse, the stuff that had dropped off the end included executive masters
that had not been changed for years. (They were still very live, however,
just not under active development.) The on-line medium was exchangeable disk
store (EDS). In those days, the largest EDS pack held 8 megabytes, and the
department had three drives. Only active sources were kept on-line. The
*only* copies of the masters I had lost resided on those back-up tapes.
Ouch!

I confessed. The most polite and least personal comment was from the
programming manager: "Oh my God! What are we going to do?"

*Fortunately*, on the day after the overflow, some of my colleagues had
deleted several large files. The result was that Monday night's back-up (for
the sake of illustration) had resulted in tape overflow and a truncated copy
of the back-up. On Tuesday night and Wednesday night, the actual size of the
entire back-up had been reduced, so that the second tape of the pair was
nowhere near full. (The back-up procedure was driven by a set of parameter
cards which specified which files were to be added and which deleted. The
back-up program worked by first copying any new files from disk, then
copying the child tapes to the grandparent tapes (overwriting them in the
process) omitting files which were declared as "deleted" by its parameters.)

Eureka! The "lost" data might still be there on the end of the second of one
of the pairs of tapes. So I took a program which would do a hardware
block-by-block read of a magnetic tape, patched into it a modification (in
1900 object code) so that instead of stopping at the "end of tape" (EOT)
mark, it halted with a suitable display and could then be restarted to copy
what lay beyond EOT, and so copied the tail-end of one of the less than full
back-ups.

Sure enough, there were all the files I had "lost"! My annual salary
increment began to look healthier!

For some reason, when I told my colleagues how I had saved the day, they
were less than impressed by my ingenuity, and unfortunately their responses
were couched in language which cannot be repeated in a polite forum such as
RISKS! :-)

This triggers an old memory: In April 1971, my then boss bought a new

was driving all over Northern Virginia and the gauge hadn't moved since
leaving the dealership.  The gauge was still registering 3/4ths of a tank

spot welded (accidentally? bored autoworker?) in place.

Subject: Is chip theft high-tech crime?

I differ from the current practice of grouping online activity, information
theft, and component theft into "high tech" crimes.  While I feel strongly
that most malintentioned online activity is covered as an instantiation of
existing law and practice, it is a different kind of activity from stealing
chips.  In my mind, hijacking a truckload of RAM chips is just like
hijacking a truckload of flavorings destined for a food plant, or grabbing a
package out of the hands of someone just leaving a jewelry store: simple
theft of valuable material with low traceability.  True "Internet crime"
might be using a hole in security to gather information about another
system; and that's no different in intent from using an insecurely-locked
door to breach the physical security of the building to get at the same
system.

Reductio ad absurdum:  If someone breaks into my house and steals my 
silverware, that's low tech crime;  if they steal my computer, it's 
high-tech crime; and if they take the stereo, it's medium-tech crime.  

We should educate the press and public on this matter, before we find 
carjacking considered a "high-tech" crime because of the engine 
computers.

Subject: Network Security Moves to Front Burner (Edupage, 28 Nov 1995)

Corporate America is emerging from a lengthy state of denial, and beginning
to take measures to protect its electronic assets.  Nearly half of the
respondents to an Information Week/Ernst & Young poll reported having lost
valuable information during the past two years, with at least 20 saying
they'd lost information worth more than $1 million.  Nearly 70% said
security risks had worsened in the last five years, and nearly 80% now have
a full-time information security director.  As one analyst noted, "As
organizational structures are flattened, corporate reliance on the
availability and integrity of information systems is becoming painfully
obvious."  (*Information Week*, 27 Nov 1995, p32)

CERT Summary CS-95:03, November 28, 1995

The CERT Coordination Center periodically issues the CERT Summary to draw
attention to the types of attacks currently being reported to our incident
response staff. The summary includes pointers to sources of information for
dealing with the problems. We also list new or updated files that are
available for anonymous FTP from ftp://info.cert.org

Past CERT Summaries are available from 
     ftp://info.cert.org/pub/cert_summaries

 * * * * *

RECENT ACTIVITY 

Since the September CERT Summary, we have seen these continuing trends in
incidents reported to us. The majority of reported incidents fit into four
categories:


1. Packet Sniffers

We continue to see daily incident reports about intruders who have installed
sniffers on compromised systems. These sniffers, used to collect account names
and passwords, are frequently installed with a kit that includes Trojan horse
binaries. The Trojan horse binaries hide the sniffer activity on the systems
on which they are installed.

For further information and methods for detecting packet sniffers and Trojan
horses, see the following files:

  ftp://info.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/CA-94:01.network.monitoring.attacks

  ftp://info.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/CA-94:05.README


2. Exploitation of SGI lp Vulnerability 

The vulnerability described in CERT advisory, CA:95:15 "SGI lp Vulnerability"
continues to be exploited, though we have seen a decline in the number of
reports since the advisory was released on November 8. Intruders gain
unauthorized access to Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI) IRIX systems through a
passwordless lp account; they use this initial access to leverage additional
privileges on the compromised system.

As distributed by SGI, the lp account (as well as other accounts), has no
password on a newly installed system. This fact is addressed in the
documentation that SGI distributes with their systems: "IRIX Advanced Site 
and Server Administrative Guide" (see the chapter on System Security).
More information on this vulnerability and how it can be addressed can be
obtained from

  ftp://info.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/CA-95:15.SGI.lp.vul


3. Network Scanning

We continue to receive several reports each week of intruders using the
Internet Security Scanner (ISS) to scan both individual hosts and large IP
address ranges. The ISS tool, which is described in CERT advisory CA-93:14
"Internet Security Scanner", interrogates all computers within a specified
IP address range, determining the security posture of each with respect to
several common system vulnerabilities. Intruders use the information
gathered from such scans to gain unauthorized access to the scanned sites.

As part of a defensive strategy, you may want to consider running ISS against
your own site (in accordance with your organization's policies and procedures)
to identify any possible system weaknesses or vulnerabilities, taking steps to
implement security fixes that may be necessary. ISS is available from

  ftp://info.cert.org/pub/tools/iss/iss13.tar

More information about the ISS tool and steps for protecting your site are 
outlined in the following documents:

4. Sendmail Attacks

New reports of intruders attacking sites through sendmail vulnerabilities are
continuing to arrive daily, although most reports indicate the attacks have
failed. The types of attacks are varied, but most are aimed at gaining
privileged access to the victim machine.

We encourage sites to combat these threats by taking the appropriate steps,
described in the following documents:

                    Call for Systems Demonstrations

The major goal of the AMAST Conferences is to put software development
technology on a firm, mathematical foundation.  Particular emphasis is given
to algebraic and logical foundations of software technology.  An eventual
goal is to establish algebraic and logical methodology as a practically
viable and attractive alternative to the prevailing ad-hoc approaches to
software engineering.  We invite submissions of system demonstrations
showing the improved effectiveness of software developed on a mathematical
basis.

The topics of interest include, but not limited to, the following:
  SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENTS
  SUPPORT FOR CORRECT  SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT
  SYSTEM SUPPORT FOR REUSE
  TOOLS FOR PROTOTYPING, VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION
  THEOREM PROVING SYSTEMS

We invite prospective authors to submit 6 copies of system demo proposals (4
double spaced pages maximum) in an area relevant to the conference theme.
Papers should provide adequate information for the reviewers to assess the
significance and anticipated impact of the system on software technology.
All submissions must be sent to the program chair at the address below; the
proposals must be received by January 15, 1996 (new extended deadline).
