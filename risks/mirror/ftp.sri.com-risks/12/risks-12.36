Subject: AT&T phone failure downs three New York airports for four hours

Operations at all three New York airports ground to a standstill from 5pm until
9pm yesterday [17Sep91] when an AT&T internal power failure at a Manhattan
4-ESS switching center knocked out long distance calls in and out of the city.
Neighboring commercial power was unaffected.  The 4-ESS system is used to route
calls between AT&T's long-distance network and the local companies.  The air
traffic control centers use a network of radio towers linked by phone lines.

   Although the precise origin of Tuesday's problems remained unclear, the
   extent of the difficulties provided yet another example of how dependent
   today's telephone networks are on a few pieces of equipment.
   
   In recent years, AT&T and other companies have gone to great lengths to
   emphasize the back-up capacity and redundancy of their systems. Yet the
   long-distance carrier was unable to reroute all traffic to other gateways
   for several hours after the problems first became apparent.''

Calls were redirected to the two remaining gateways, but those could not handle
that much increased traffic.  [Quotes above are by Ed Andrews, whose article
``AT&T Phone Failure'' appeared in the N.Y. Times, 18Sep91.]

I just spoke with Ed Andrews, who is working on a story for tomorrow's NYTimes.
The current theory seems to be that AT&T was trying to be helpful to ConEd in
NY by cutting its usage of commercial power on a hot day by running on internal
power, but somehow did not realize that their backup power generator was not
properly linked in, and that they were actually running on batteries for 6
hours until the batteries were drained!  As the details unfold, we may find out
the extent to which the system diagnostics and alarms gave a true picture of
what was really happening.  (Shades of the Three Mile Island crew trying to
figure out what was happening?)  So, check Ed's article tomorrow for further
details.

Here we have another example of creative redundancy and supposedly conservative
design (hardware reliability, fault tolerance, extra capacity, alternative
routing, standby power, etc.) still not being good enough to prevent massive
outages.  From the system level viewpoint, it seems that we should be learning
something more from the repeated cases of telephone outages (AT&T and Sprint
outages reported here in the past, due to software, cable cuts, etc.) and
airport shutdowns resulting from extensive telephone outages -- e.g., last
year's O`Hare disruptions due to the Chicago cable cut on 15Oct90 (R.I. Cook,
RISKS-10.62, and ACM Software Engineering Notes 16 1, January 1991) and the
three New York airport disruptions due to the fiber-optic cable cut in Newark
NJ, also affecting various commodities exhanges and long-distance calling for 9
hours on 4Jan91 (RISKS-10.75 and ACM Software Engineering Notes 16 1, January
1991).  On one hand, RISKS readers know that no matter how carefully designed
and operated a system is, it can still fail grotesquely.  On the other hand, we
still have to try much harder to avoid those possibilities -- and indeed
likelihoods.  You would like to think that airports and air traffic control
could find ways of not being crunched by the outage of a single switch, but
it keeps on happening!

I hope some of you will come to the ACM SIGSOFT '91 (Software for Critical
Systems) at the Fairmont Hotel in New Orleans, 4-6 December 1991, where some of
the underlying problems and potential solutions will be discussed.  In
particular, Michael Meyers of AT&T Bell Labs in Naperville will be giving an
invited talk on "Reliable Software for the 4 ESS Switch".  Henry Petroski's
talk on "Human Error in Design" is also relevant to this topic.  The
preliminary program and other information appeared in RISKS-12.10.  The
registration packet is contained in the September CACM (pp.112-113), and is
also available on-line from Judith Burgess (Burgess@csl.sri.com).  I think the
program will be of great interest to the software oriented seriously minded
risks-aware community.  Peter

Subject: Fly-by-wire without leaving the ground

James Higgins, THE DETROIT NEWS, 15 September, page 1C: ...  Clemson engineers
... have patented a new automobile camshaft/throttle control system they say
can boost fuel economy by 20 percent in a gasoline engine-- more than that in a
Diesel. ... Just by announcing the development (in a press release which, by
the way, skated lightly over some serious concerns about the new system),
Clemson has made it more likely that U.S., Japanese and German automakers will
lose their fight against tough new fuel economy legislation in Washington.  ...
A camshaft controls the action of the valves that let mixed fuel and air into
an engine and allow burned gases to escape.  Usually it's set up so that the
valves will open or close according to just one setting.  That setting is a
compromise, not...optimal...for all engine speeds. ... In the Clemson system,
the camshaft consists of two shafts, one of which rotates inside the other.  An
infinite variety of valve settings is possible, theoretically allowing optimal
valve action in every situation.

In its announcement, the university said the Clemson Camshaft system "improves
fuel economy by approximately 20 percent."  Detroit engineers object
strenuously to this, saying optimal camshaft action can only boost fuel economy
by about 5 percent.  [co-inventor] Nelson agrees.  But here's the nub--his
system also includes a computer-controlled device that electronically allows
the camshaft to act as the car's throttle--a revolutionary idea.  All cars
today have a throttle plate that opens to allow air into the engine, and in
every car on the road the throttle plate is mechanically connected to the gas
pedal.

The Clemson system substitutes [for] the mechanical connection...a computer
control--a "fly by wire" device like those...on advanced aircraft.  When the
engine doesn't have to labor against a partially closed throttle, significant
fuel economy gains are possible, Nelson says.  This, together with the camshaft
action, is the source of the 20 percent figure.  But it also raises a whole
host of safety concerns--not to mention potential problems with cost,
manufacturing complexity, durability and so forth.  Overall, though, it looks
promising to this reporter.  And one hopes it will get a thorough investigation
from the industry on its own merits, free from the nasty politics surrounding
the fuel economy issue.

bank officials, who use computers to transfer billions from developed countries
to hard-pressed parts of the world, wondered at first if it was possible for
some tiny nation to fill its coffers by tapping into their inner sanctum.  An
international army of computer nerds and police experts soon tracked down the

that disgruntled hackers there are still at work injecting disruptive

Subject: The risks of a computer-based forum

Many people seem to approach e-mail and submissions to forums like RISKS as
informal conversation. Given the persistence of the typed word, however, it may
often be more appropriate to consider these forums as un-refereed journals.

Two recent examples from Volume 12, Issue 35:

Although I greatly appreciate Jeremy Grodberg's intellectual integrity spending
many hours researching the objections raised to his claims, and subsequent
posting of a retraction of those claims, I find his lack of references
disturbing. He has introduced new figures and new claims, backed up only by his
assertion of having spent "6 hours in a medical library". It is clear to me
that he may truly have found some additional sources, but it is puzzling why he
is unwilling to share them with us.

Clifford Johnson fails similarly in his diatribe against the misuse of the
MMPI. After an excellent introduction to the nature of the test and its
shortcomings, he berates "Minnesotan academics" for their "myopic" articles in
prestigious journals. Is he merely being polite by not sharing with us the name
of at least one of these journals, or a citation to at least on of these
articles of "statistical nonsense"?

While it is acceptable to make unsubstantiated statements such as these in
casual conversation, let us remember that the RISKS forum is not only archived
for posterity, but is often the subject of citations itself.

Subject: Descriptive terms

  [There are some people who prefer TYPE ONE ERRORS and
  TYPE TWO ERRORS to False Positives and False Negatives.  PGN]

How ugly!  And a retreat from clear, forceful, prose.

Fortunately there are four perfectly good terms from signal detection theory:
hit, miss, false alarm, and correct rejection.  Here is a grid that explains
them:
                 \
           said   \   was (what was actually the case)
      (what the    \
     test reported) \      signal              noise
                     +-----------------+-------------------+
       signal (yes)  |        hit      |       false alarm |
                     +-----------------+-------------------+
       noise  (no)   |       miss      | correct rejection |
                     +-----------------+-------------------+

Unlike false positives or type one errors, false alarms conveys the error and
its problems in vivid English.

Unlike false negatives or type two errors, misses denotes the type of error and
reminds us of outcomes.

This terminology gives us a reasonable way to distinguish various leading and
misleading statistics.  The chance of the test saying yes when the fact is yes
is:
                         hits
                         ----
                     hits + misses

This can also be called hit rate on signal trials.

The chance of the test saying no when the fact is yes is

                         misses
                         ------
                      hits + misses

This can also be called miss rate on signal trials.

The chance of the fact being yes given the test said no is:

                         misses
                         ------
               misses + correct rejections

This can also be called miss rate on said no trials.

And the chance of the fact being no given the test said yes is:

                     false alarms
                     ------------
                  false alarms + hits 

This can also be called false alarm rate on said no trails.

And so on.  All of these may be distinguished from the overall hit rate:

                         hits
                         ----
      hits + misses + correct rejections + false alarms

The overall miss rate:
                         misses
                         ------
      hits + misses + correct rejections + false alarms

The a priori chance of the test saying no:

               correct rejections + misses
               ---------------------------
      hits + misses + correct rejections + false alarms

The a priori chance of the fact being no:

            correct rejections + false alarms 
            ---------------------------------
      hits + misses + correct rejections + false alarms

Clearly these are all derived numbers.  The numbers you want are the
raw numbers in the grid, e.g.:

                 \
           said   \   was (what was actually the case)
      (what the    \
     test reported) \      signal              noise
                     +-----------------+-------------------+
       signal (yes)  |        50       |        10         |
                     +-----------------+-------------------+
       noise  (no)   |         5       |       100         |
                     +-----------------+-------------------+

Or more compactly, 50 hits, 10 false alarms, 5 misses, 100 correct
rejections.  From this you can derive all the numbers you want to
compare, make all the inferences the data can sustain, and make the
wisest decisions based on the available information and your personal
values.

Subject: Risks of mistreating programmers

 One of our local public radio stations carries BBC news before the regular NPR
news on weekdays, and I heard this on my way home. Pardon any errors in
reporting, I was after all in a car and this is all from memory.

 Apparently there's been a rash of new computer virus infections since the
collapse of the Eastern Bloc, coming out mostly from Bulgaria.  Since the
Bulgarian government couldn't buy western computers or software, they would get
one copy illegally and then copy them freely. Since most software is
copy-protected in some manner, they trained a number of programmers to find
ways to defeat said protection. Because the programmers didn't like doing this,
and since they didn't pay them very much money, the programmers also spent some
time perfecting their skills at virus-writing. Now that it's easy to send
software back and forth, these virus' (virii?) are now spreading through the
rest of the world. The one quote I do remember is "There's one bulletin-board
system in Sophia that's absolutely notorious for them, and people are uploading
virus' to it all the time."

No, factoring is in NP intersect coNP and it is widely believed that
no problem in NP intersect coNP is NP complete (but who knows).  People do
believe that factoring is hard though.  I also (vaguely) remember a theorem
that any problem you can build a public key code out of is going to be
in NP intersect coNP because you could verify both positive and negative
instances of the problem by watching a party with the key information
classify messages as legitimate or forgeries.

If P=NP then if the amount of information (entropy in Shannon's sense) in a
series of messages exceeds the amount of information in the encryption key then
you can learn something about the messages.  So if P=NP private key
cryptography is still possible- but only with *large* keys (like one time
pads).

I would argue that Mike is simply taking a requirement (the unique id each

if they were not required to have plates.

Society also allows people to advertise themselves, within certain limits,
by getting vanity plates. If it is such a detriment to society then it would
have been legislated out of existence. Since that's not the case I don't see
why Dave is upset about Mike and others who are well within the law in
expressing themselves.

Mike pays taxes as well. He certainly should have the right to express
himself. I don't agree with Plato's view of the ideal society as being an
antlike colony in which individuality can't/shouldn't exist (or if it
exists, can't mainfest itself).

The problem with this argument is that Mike was *not* misusing his license
plate. The problem, and the RISK, is that society allows people to have
non-standard plates without properly dealing with the consequences. If anyone
owes anything for the waste of the cop's time (and Mike's!), it should be the
people who designed the computer system without taking into account all of the
possible legitimate plates. Don't blame the effect for the cause.

You are misplacing the blame here.  The bureaucracy that controls the license
plates sells personalized plates for a fee.  They even advertise this (in the
US, anyway).  If this bureaucracy is stupid enough to advertise an offer that
causes them more trouble than it is worth, the blame belongs squarely on the

The connection between opinion and governmental action is much more tenuous
than you say.  People vote for legislators, not for policies, and a majority
isn't a consensus.

Perhaps this is getting peripheral to the original discussion, but I cannot let
Dave Roberts's characterization of ham radio license plates as a misuse of
license plates go unchallenged.

Ham radio plates are not a misuse of the system--they are sanctioned by it.
For example, in two states where I have lived, Michigan and Illinois, hams pay
a very small fee (about $2) or nothing at all for the privilege of having their
call sign on their plates, while other who get personalized ("vanity") plates
pay a substantial sum (about $75, if I remember correctly).

There are a couple of reasons why the state governments do this.  Ham radio
operators provide emergency communications during tornados, floods, and other
disasters.  Frequently ham radio emergency groups will have operators stationed
in the police departments and weather service offices, relaying information
between the government networks and the ham radio emergency networks.  Being
able to identify the vehicles of radio operators during an emergency is a
useful thing.  Of course, not all hams are involved in emergency service, but
there's a good chance that those at the site of an emergency are.

Also, state governments issue the ham plates to comemorate the service
of ham radio operators, just as they have (at least in Illinois) Armed
Forces plates, and purple heart plates, and ex-POW plates, and the like.

So, if the government of California issues ham plates, but can't find
them in their computer, this is a standard computer data entry problem,
not a misuse of the system by ham radio operators.

Possibly he was reading the zero as an O.  Someone in rec.ham-radio some time
ago mentioned that, in California, they once had some trouble during a traffic
stop because of their plate: WB6OOO (oh oh oh).  The policeman was *sure* it
was a bogus plate, because letter-letter-four-digits is the pattern used for
commercial vans (I believe), which the passenger car in front of him plainly
wasn't.  And sure enough, the computer had no record of "W-B-6-thousand".
Fortunately he eventually was convinced to try W-B-6-oh-oh-oh, and after some
gyration getting the person on the computer to type it in right, was rewarded
with valid registration info.  Oh-Oh-Oh indeed.
