Subject: Life, Death, and Faxes -- Convicted forger released by bogus fax

Jean Paul Barrett, a convict serving 33 years for forgery and fraud in the Pima
County jail in Tuscon, Arizona, was released on 13Dec91 after receipt of a
forged fax ordering his release.  It appears that a copy of a legitimate
release order was altered to bear HIS name.  Apparently no one noticed that the
faxed document lacked an originating phone number or that there was no "formal"
cover sheet.  The "error" was discovered when Barrett failed to show up for a
court hearing.

The jail releases about 60 people each day, and faxes have become standard
procedure.  Sheriff's Sergeant Rick Kastigar said "procedures are being changed
so the error will not occur again."  [Abstracted by PGN from "Fraudulent Fax
Gets Forger Freed", an item in the San Francisco Chronicle, 18Dec91, p.A3]

The RISKS annals contain earlier cases of people getting out of jail by
altering the prison computer system database (LA County) or nearly succeeding
in doing so (Santa Clara).  Authentication sufficient to automagically detect
bogus messages (EMail, Fax, voice mail, etc.) has been discussed here in the
past, and might have been useful here.  But probably not...  PGN

Subject: BT ordered to pay damages for keyboard injuries

     Oracle Teletext service (ITV, UK), 16-Dec-1991, has just reported that two
former keyboard operators have been awarded 6000 pounds Sterling damages
(approx. $10000) against British Telecom for pain caused by their work.  It
appears that the two operators suffered repetitive strain injury (RSI) because
of unsuitable chairs. Judge John Byrt, sitting at a court in London's
Guildhall, said that BT was not negligent by making them work too hard.  "
Union officials said the ruling was a breakthrough in making employers take
responsibility for serious injuries caused by high-speed work on computers. "

Subject: Re: Privacy of Email (Lui, RISKS-12.69)

>>A spokesman for Epson America, which is based in Torrance, CA, refused to
discuss Shoars's account of the monitoring episode and insisted that her
dismissal had nothing to do with her questioning of the electronic mail
practice.  He denied that Epson America, the United States marketing arm of a
Japanese company, had a policy of monitoring electronic mail.<<

Allow me to suggest that there may be some merit in this statement. I would
further suggest that there was far more to Epson v  Shoars than we have been
led to think. Some stories I've seen circulating suggest that Shoars was far
from what you would call the ideal worker, in terms of what she produced. At
this point, Epson was searching for a way to eliminate her.  Here, their
problems began. HAve any of you who happen to be supervisors, attempted to fire
a non-productive worker who was among the people supposedly trampled on by
society? I'm talking about EEO laws, of course.

(Before you get bent outta shape, I don't object to the concept of equality,
certainly... just the way the idiots in Washington have decided to provide it.)

 The Shoars case is  one  where the real issues were being masked by supposed
abuses of electronic mail, IMHO. It is perhaps this reason, that causes many to
think that it's not the landmark case that Shoars, as well as certain groups,
would have you think.

Another point... one that nobody seems to get... is her old super still working
for the company?

My old school-mate, Gene Spafford and I diagree on this one, I'm afraid. As
Mike Simmons says:

"If the corporation owns the equipment and pays for the network, that asset
belongs to the company, and it has a right to look and see if people are using
it for purposes other than running the business,"

 I would think restraint could be used on the part of the employer... and is in
most cases.... (FOr example, if my employer didn't, you'd not be reading this).

However, I would point out that with so much work today being done on company
computers... so much of the work day focused on that one item... that watching
Email is one of the few tools left to the employer to monitor the employee. Sit
accross an office from someone on their terminal. Can you tell if they're doing
cost estimates, if if they're laying odds on the ponies, or perhaps playing
D&D?

As someone recently said: If a train station is where a train stops, what is a
work station?

Opinions are my own, of course, and may or may not agree with official
policy... but give me time....

Subject:      Re: More on E911 and representation (RISKS 12.69)

In the Dutch telephone numbering plan, all area codes starting with 06 were
unused until a few years ago, presumably "reserved for future use".
When this empty can was finally opened, it quickly turned into a can of worms.
Within the 06 prefix today, you find:
- toll free services
- services carrying a surcharge, such as party lines (10 callers randomly
  put in "teleconference"), sex lines, etc.
- PTT special services such as Information, Fault reporting, Time, Weather
- Private and public companies and institutions wanting a nation-wide number
And, since mid 1991, the notion-wide emergency number 06-11!

The first digit following the 06 does provide some classification, for example,
06-0 and 06-4 are toll free numbers. But this is not consistent. 06-11 is toll
free, as you might assume, but the number as such is not in the 06-0 or 06-4
number group. The significance of the third digit is not widely publicized,
so it is not obvious what the charge for a certain number will be, unless you
study the subject rather carefully.

And now the computer RISK:
Many companies have programmes their PABXs to disallow calling 06 numbers
because most of these have little or no relevance to the company, and many
carry rather heavy surcharges. In so doing, calling the 06-11 emergency
number is also blocked!

Some companies start to realize the problem, and do something about it. But,
to my opinion, the real problem is a bad numbering plan. An emergency number
should really stand out from "common" numbers, and not be grouped together
with surcharge numbers.

Finally, I totally agree with Bob Frankston that more standardization is
called for in numbering. I travel quite a lot to several countries, and
often have difficulty remembering the international prefix when calling
out from a particular country.

                                First Announcement of
              THE SECOND CONFERENCE ON COMPUTERS, FREEDOM, AND PRIVACY
              L'Enfant Plaza Hotel, Washington DC    March 18-20, 1992

(A longer, complete, electronic version of this announcement is available
by sending a request with any title and any message to cfp2-info@eff.org.)

(The printed announcement (brochure) is available -- see end of this notice.)

     The rush of computers into our workplaces, homes, and institutions is
drastically altering how we work and live, how we buy and sell, and with whom
we communicate.  Computers are obliterating traditional political and
organizational boundaries, making time zones irrelevant, and bridging diverse
cultures.  They are fundamentally changing our culture, values, laws,
traditions, and identities.

     The turmoil of the changes calls into question many old assumptions about
privacy, freedom of speech, search and seizure, access to personal and
governmental information, professional responsibilities, ethics,
criminality, law enforcement, and more.  The only way to sort out these
issues and arrive at a consensus for action is to acknowledge that we don't
know the answers -- and then, with reason and good will, to find the
answers through discussion and education.  That's why the Conference on
Computers, Freedom, and Privacy was founded in 1991.

     The Computers, Freedom, and Privacy Conference is unique.  It has no
"agenda for change".  It seeks only to bring together people from all the major
communities and interest groups that have a stake in the new world being shaped
by information technology, so that they may share their ideas, ideals, concerns
and experiences.

     At the first conference, hundreds of people from the fields of law,
computer science, law enforcement, business, public policy, government,
education, research, marketing, information providing, advocacy and a host of
others met for several days.  It was the first time such a diverse group had
ever assembled, and the exchange of ideas and points of view was electric.

     The conference is "single-track" -- all participants attend all the
sessions.  A morning of tutorials at the beginning of the conference will help
participants get up to speed in specific "hot" areas.  The conference sessions
themselves take up timely and, at times, thorny issues.  Each session aims for
a balance of perspectives in order to assist diverse groups appreciate the
views of others.  A brief examination of the long list of sponsoring and
supporting organizations will reveal that this respect for diverse outlooks is
built into the conference from the ground up.

     The question is no longer whether information technologies will change our
world.  They are, now.  The real question is how we, as citizens and
professionals, will respond to and manage that change.  Those at the Second
Conference on Computers, Freedom, and Privacy will lead the way.
