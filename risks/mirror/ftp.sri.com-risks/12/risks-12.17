Subject: Computer-related problems at Cape Canaveral

Last week, the range safety officer at Cape Canaveral had to destroy a rocket
because it was off-course.  The reason: a technician hit the wrong key while
loading the guidance software, and the ground test version was loaded instead
of flight software.  And that caused the steering nozzles to lock in place.
The error was apparently obvious on printouts, but no one checked them.

Even the right code were loaded, the rocket may have malfunctioned anyway.  A
bug was discovered in the navigation programs of a second rocket of the same
model; it would have caused the rocket to head in the wrong direction.
Launches have been suspended until they can check things over some more.  (It
isn't known if the destroyed rocket had the same bug.)

The two rockets were conducting SDI-related experiments.  The article I saw
made no mention of the irony.

Subject: Computer communications and the aborted Soviet coup

Apprently EMail, Internet, CompuServe, and FAX played a major part in foiling
the aborted coup attempt in the Soviet Union.  Despite local news blackouts,
various communiques found their way around quite successfully.  ``While
messages from Russian President Boris Yeltsin and other coup opponents were
being sent throughout Asia, Europe and North America this week, the committee
that tried to seize power either didn't know about or couldn't keep up with the
instantaneous network transmissions.  ... The unprecedented connection, made
possible by the introduction of thousands of personal computers into the Soviet
Union under President Mikhail Gorbachev, put a kink into plans to control the
flow of information.''  [Source: DURING COUP ATTEMPT, SOVIET COMPUTER USERS FED

Subject: Medical records for sale

No computers seem to be involved in this story, but it's an illustration of
modern trends.

The New York Times (14 Aug 91, page A10) reports on a controversy that has
arisen in Greenville, South Carolina.  It seems that Dr. Donald Miller moved to
Michigan not long ago.  He tried, but without success, to find another doctor
to sell his practice to.  Ultimately, it was sold at auction.  Bidding against
a number of doctors and other salvage dealers, Claude Rogers, an area
businessman who runs an auto body and salvage company, an auto leasing concern,
and various real estate ventures, bought the building that held the practice
and all the equipment for $92,000.  He was also the only bidder at a separate
auction, at which he obtained thousands of patient records for $4,000.

Mr. Rogers felt the records were a valuable resource, defining a ready made
market of some 8,000 to 10,000 potential patients; he intended to sell them,
along with the physical pieces of the practice, to another doctor.  However, he
drew no offers - only cries of outrage that someone who was not a medical
provider ended up with access to confidential medical information.  Mr. Rogers
says he signed a document, at Dr. Miller's request, pledging to maintain the
confidentiality of the records.  In a move he viewed as a service to the
patients - but which many saw as an additional cause for concern - Mr. Rogers
ran ads in the local papers offering people copies of their medical records for
$25.  Mr. Rogers says the fee is the standard amount doctors charge insurance
companies in accident claim cases.  (According to a doctor I spoke to, $25
would be a rather low fee.  However, doctors do not normally charge patients
for copies of their own records.)  He says he's had about 30 requests for
copies, about half from people on fixed incomes, for whom he's waived the
charge.

There appears to be no clear legal protection for the confidentiality of
doctor's records when the doctor dies or dissolves his practice.  According to
the American Medical Records Association, which represents 35,000 people who
maintain medical records (is it my imagination or is there an "Association" for
every possible grouping of businesses?), privacy rules are clear regarding
hospitals, but less so for private practices.  The article doesn't indicate
what the rules are, or whether they are voluntary or enforceable under state or
Federal law, but the association's spokeswoman implied that hospitals must keep
medical records confidential.

According to Mr. Rogers, all that counts is a happy ending, and the story
appears to have one: Dr. Kevin Smith bought the records (at a "considerable
profit" to Mr. Rogers), and is leasing Dr. Miller's old practice.  Mr. Rogers
says the ready-made patient pool won Dr. Smith over; Dr. Smith was unavailable
for comment.

Subject: Automating commodities markets

  "The Chicago Board of Trade, departing from its 143-year-old tradition of
  frenzied pit trading, announced plans Wednesday [21 August 1991] for a new
  steel futures contract to be traded only on computer screens. [...]  It also
  represents a cautious step ... away from the increasingly controversial
  open-outcry trading technique that the Board of Trade practically invented.
  [...]  Open-outcry trading has been criticized in recent years ...
  prosecutors alleged corrupt traders used the pandemonium of the pits to cover
  for illegal schemes.  [...]"  [AP wire story]

It happens quite often that an organization or individual proposes to sanitize
the operation of some market--soybean oil, Impressionist masters, gold coins,
...--by moving the operation on-line.  It is EXTREMELY rare for an appropriate
discussion of the comp.risks of automation to accompany the litany of benefits.

Among the chief concerns of existing market participants are: privacy;
reliability; response time; exception-handling; and synchronicity.  Automated
data-processing certainly has experience addressing precisely those
requirements, but not all the experience has been happy.  There are bound to be
more problems in the future.

Personal opinion: from the little contact I've had, the Chicago exchanges have
been effective in their automation efforts.  I expect the BoT will make this
latest experiment a success, too.  However, it's quite typical of them to
present information to the public which includes no hint of the possible
negatives.

They plan to restrict the sale of laser printers?

This month's issue of "Byte" lists a relatively inexpensive software

printer.  Magnetic toner cartridges are available for about $150.  So much

Even if they restrict the sale of magnetic toner, most banks take the
occasional unreadable MICR numbers in stride and simply re-encode them on
a strip of paper glued to the original document.  The sheer volume of
checks processed makes examining even these special cases impractical.

I don't mind seeing them throw stones: in fact, I hope to see more of it.  Then
maybe some of these industry giants will put a little money into making

Subject: more about California's Automatic Vehicle Identification specification

A brief addendum to Phil Agre's note in Risks 12.15 about the State of
California's Department of Transportation and Automatic Vehicle Identification
(AVI):

The current version (dated 20 Aug 91) of the specifications for the
compatibility of the AVI equipment is now a "Notice of Proposed Regulatory
Action".  There will be a public hearing about this spec in Sacramento on
October 18, 1991.  Written comments will be accepted up to that date at the
address below.  "Following the public hearing and comment period, the
proposal may be adopted substantially as set forth without further notice."

The section on encryption, in the current version, reads in total: "The
encryption methodology to be used is defined with individual data message
formats.  There is no requirement that subsequent message definitions share
encryption method [sic] with previously defined data messages."  Elsewhere, the
standardized DES encodings are referenced although the requirement to use
encryption appears to be outside the boundaries of the technical specification.
Each type of radio message between fixed receiver and mobile transponder has
both an encrypted and unencrypted form.

A rather short, but useful, section in the preface entitled "Informative
Digest" details some of the history of AVI spec.  Basically, in Sept 1990
Senate Bill No. 1523 added some sections to the Streets and Highways Code, that
provided, in part, that "The Department of Transportation, in cooperation with
the district and all known entities planning to implement a toll facility in
this state, shall develop and adopt functional specifications and standards for
an automatic vehicle identification system."

"Requests for copies of proposed regulations or the initial statement of
reasons, written comments, or proposed regulations and questions concerning
the proposed adoption of the regulations and the public hearing should be
addressed to:

Les Kubel, Chief, Office of Electrical & Electronics Engineering
Department of Transportation, Division of New Technology - Materials and Research
5900 Folsom Blvd., Sacramento CA 95819          (916) 739-2405"

Comments about the Senate Bill are probably best addressed to your state
representative and the Governor.

Subject: Use of ATM for blackmail in UK TV script

A recent TV program in the UK shows a police investigation into a crime
(Indelible Evidence).  A blackmailer worked by requesting that money be
deposited into an account, which they then withdrew by ATM.  There was a point
in the program where a terminal was shown listing the card and account numbers
of EVERY use of an ATM. (Such equipment had been set up initially covering all
possible machines country wide.  Surely it would have been possible to have the
Bank's central computer recognise the card and put the location of use on a
terminal, without needing to display details of any of the customers who may
have used the machine.)

Subject: Desktop Forgeries (RE: Sherizen, RISKS-12.15)

Sanford Sherizen posts comments regarding use of desktop publishing to forge
paper documents:

One wonders if this is significant in comparison to copies made by high
quality copiers.

>A related issue is the modification of documents, so that unauthorized changes

This would seem to be a serious risk.

In the electronic document world, much work has been done on the issue
of cryptographic signatures, which both certify the signature and
protect the contents from undetected alteration.

Since most important documents today are generated by computer systems,
is there any reason that the same technology could not be used for
paper documents? When a document is generated, a cryptographic hashing function
would be computed, and the result PRINTED on the document. With certain
standardization on what is included in the hash, and what formats are used
(no old English script, or whatever), the document could be validated
using a scanner with associated crypto algorithm (probably using public keys).

Is any work being done in these areas? Should it be?

In an attempt to remain private, one is often required to make a big fuss and

Subject: sometimes you can only get there using the long way around

The primary Internet link between North America and Asia uses circuits in HAW-4
undersea fiber optic cable between California and Hawaii, and from Hawaii,
other undersea cable circuits to Japan and Korea (indeed, until recently most
Internet traffic between North America and Australia went through HAW-4 as
well, then via satellite between Hawaii and Australia; though recently they
switched to a direct satellite link with California).

At about 0100HST Saturday, repeater #37 on HAW-4 failed, bringing down all the
circuits on the cable.  An AT&T cable repair ship was dispatched from Honolulu
on Saturday, has been on site since Monday, and at last report was still
grappling to try to bring the repeater to the surface for repairs.  The precise
cause of the failure is not yet known.  Estimates of full restoration of HAW-4
service range from several days to as long as a couple of weeks.

Overseas telephone services were switched over to other, older (copper) cables
and various satellites in a fairly straightforward manner.  And while there's
less trans-Pacific phone capacity now, I don't believe there's been much if any
noticeable interruption of service.  Overseas television flows primarily via
satellite anyways, and as far as I know, hasn't been affected at all.

Finding alternative computer network circuits turned out to be
considerably more challenging.  An alternate circuit using
international satellite connections was set up between North American
and Japan fairly quickly.  But between the limited capability of the
older undersea cables and a shortage of U.S. domestic satellite
transponder capability (more precisely: an apparent shortage of
transponders which can use "spot beam" capability with Hawaii), there
didn't seem to be any way to set up an alternative connection between
Hawaii and the rest of the United States.

Until someone remembered that the circuits between Japan and Hawaii
were still working perfectly well...

As of approximately 1000HST Tuesday, Hawaii was reconnected with North America
via: an international satellite link between California and Japan, and an
undersea cable link between Japan and Hawaii.  Only at 384Kbps (1/3rd of the
former HAW-4 circuit speed), and it's a rather roundabout "bypass", but it
seems to work quite well.

Subject: Re: canopus.stanford.edu goes nova

On June 18, 1990 I reported how the Hitachi monitor of my color Sun 3-110
workstation had suddenly released enough irritating fumes to prompt the
evacuation of our (extremely poorly ventilated) Stanford building the previous
evening. Here is the promised followup...

Stanford Health and Safety was quite concerned about the incident; there are a
lot of Suns at Stanford, and the fumes were still powerful enough a day after
the event that persons entering my office would develop a headache and watering
eyes within a few minutes. People in our building naturally wanted to know what
toxic chemicals they were being exposed to. Health and Safety wanted to know if
this might happen again. (I wanted to know when I could use my office again.)
The Sun front-office people that Health and Safety first contacted insisted
that this failure mode was virtually unknown and it would almost certainly
never recur. We were suspicious of this claim, since in our research group we
owned only six Suns of that particular model, and mine was the _second_ monitor
to fail this way within as many years. (The first one fortunately had failed
when the building was empty and when the ventilation was working better, so
Health and Safety didn't get called that time.)

My posting to risks which appeared a few days later netted a handful of
accounts about similar incidents, mostly in Europe. More importantly, it
prompted an immediate response from more informed people within Sun [Health and
Safety was still trying to beat past the outermost layer of bureaucracy by
telephone with little success]. Sun quickly retrieved the offending monitor
from Health and Safety (who had carted it off and stored it as toxic waste) and
launched an investigation. Sun determined the part that failed was a capacitor
in the high-voltage line. This caused the flyback transformer coils to
overheat, which in turn caused "a small amount of the case material of the
flyback transformer to burn". Sun asked Hitachi, who made the monitor, to
investigate what was in the resulting smoke. The conclusion was "There were
trace quantities of a number of chemicals in the smoke. We do not believe that
a short exposure to the small amount of smoke emitted represents a hazard to
the individuals involved."

Sun helpfully included a copy of Hitachi's lab tests showing what they got when
they burned some transformer casing in a test chamber. It showed 10 parts per
million CO (with 100 the maximum allowed by the American Conference of
Governmental Industrial Hygienists), 800 ppm CO2 (no limit), 2 ppm Formalin (3
max allowed), 1.2 ppm Toluene (150 max), 1.7 ppm Ethylbenzene (125 max), and
3.4 ppm Styrene (100 max).  This seemed strange to me; if the smoke were so
innocuous why did breathing the air in my office still make me sick more than a
day after the event, despite my best attempts to dissipate the fumes? I wanted
to know how big a sample Hitachi had burned, and how much air the resulting
smoke had been diluted in!

The contact person at Sun seemed a little annoyed that I still wasn't
satisfied, and resignedly explained again and again that "parts per million"
was independent of the air volume. It didn't matter what size room the Sun was
in, how good the ventilation was, or how much transformer case burned.  I
pointed out that it was a good thing my sun hadn't been outside, or the entire
Earth's atmosphere would be contaminated with 2/3 the legal limit for Formalin.
Right? They promised to get back in touch with Hitachi.

Three months later I got another letter. It had the same numbers (in ppm) as
before, and again had no information about the volume of the test chamber or
the amount of transformer casing material burned in the test. It further
patiently explained "All of the measured smoke constituents are significantly
below OSHA's established minimum exposure levels. Since the smoke examined in
the analysis is of the same type as emitted during flyback transformer failures
at Stanford, no significant concerns are raised by the monitor failures you
experienced." I tried calling and asking for clarification again, got the same
explanations about ppm being independent of air volume (why couldn't I
understand such a simple concept?!). Finally I gave up (after all the smell was
gone by this time and there seemed to be no ill aftereffects).

The second letter did have some interesting new information, however.
Previously we had been told our monitor failures were practically unique; the
new letter stated that "When the flyback transformer failure was discovered the
total failure rate per month attributable to the flyback capacitors was only .4
percent. After the process improvement, which was promptly implemented, the
failure rate was reduced to .04 percent. Although the newer model is superior,
the older model was within the range of reasonable failure. Sun recognizes the
frustration and disappointment that you must have experienced as a result of
two monitor failures. This is an extremely unusual occurence [sic] and one that
Sun would like to avoid in the future."

Was it unlucky? We had 6 monitors for 3 1/2 years; given Sun's stated rate of
.4% per month, the chance of at least one failure was 1.-(1.-.004)^(12*3.5*6) =
64%. Having 2 failures instead of just 1 _was_ probably a little unlucky.  Was
our problem _unusual_? Probably yes; from reading between the lines it sounds
like the problem only occurred with certain smaller-sized Hitachi monitors
delivered around the same time ours were, Sept 1986 - Jan 1987. Our bad luck
was in getting 6 monitors from this batch, and then keeping them in near
constant use for several years.

The letter continued "Sun is prepared therefore to replace, at no charge, the
four monitors remaining in the Department of Geophysics ... for your
understanding that the failure rates are negligible and that in any event,
monitor failures are unlikely to pose future problems." Our research group took
the deal. Not surprisingly, the Geophysics department at Stanford has had no
more such incidents since the monitors were replaced (despite a significant
expansion in the total number of Suns in the building).

Since my research group accepted the deal, I thought it was appropriate to wait
until I graduated and had left Stanford before posting this. I do have a Sun
on my desk here in Hawaii and like it a lot; I don't expect it will go "Nova"
like canopus.stanford.edu did! I'll let readers draw their own conclusions
about the various sorts of RISKS illustrated by my story...
