Computer Watch On Nuclear Plant Raises Safety Fears
by Susan Watts, Technology Correspondent
 
Fears are growing that computer software designed to protect the Sizewell B
nuclear reactor from serious accidents is too complex to check.
 
Sizewell B will be the first nuclear power station in the UK to rely so heavily
on computers in its primary protection system.  A computer-controlled safety
system was seen as superior to one operated by people because of the risk of
human error.
 
But Nuclear Electric has told the Independent on Sunday that the system for
Sizewell B, based around some 300-400 micro-processors, is made up of modules
which in total constitute more than 100,000 lines of code.
 
A number of software engineers close to the project are known to have suggested
that the software is now so unmanageable that is should be scrapped, and the
whole system built again.
 
The Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII), the public's watchdog on the
nuclear industry, has taken the unusual step of publishing the safety
requirements it is asking of Nuclear Electric, the company that will operate
Sizewell B, before the utility can expect a licence to go ahead with the power
station.
 
This is an attempt to calm the mounting anxieties of specialists in
"safety-critical" programs such as the protection system at Sizewell - where
lifes are at risk should the software fail.
 
Two senior inspectors describe the watchdog's requirements in a paper in the
latest issue of the trade journal Nuclear Engineering International.  The paper
is unusual because the NII traditionally keeps its options open when decided
whether to grant a nuclear power station a licence.  The onus is on the
operator to prove that its system is safe.  Publishing this description of its
requirements gives a clear idea of what the NII expects of Nuclear Electric.
 
Independent experts in safety-critical software are not happy with the NII's
safety requirements.  They say the paper shows the inspectorate is not asking
Nuclear Electric to use the most stringent testing procedures currently
available to prove that the software will work as specified.
 
They also criticise the inspectorate for not insisting on the most up to date
mathematical analysis that could give an indication of the software's
reliability.
 
These critics what Nuclear Electric to publish the results of its own internal
assessments and those of independent consultants whose date would give the rest
of the industry a chance to see just to how reliable the protection software is
meant to be.
 
The British Computer Society says it would welcome the chance to comment of the
safety case for the software.  It is concerned about what it sees as "the
secrecy which surrounds the safety-critical software in the Sizewell B control
and production systems".
 
David Parnas, an advisor on a similar project at a nuclear reactor in
Darlington in Canada, agrees.  "If somebody is introducing a technology with as
bad a reputation as software, then they are obliged to show that they have done
a really thorough analysis."  Given the public interest, he says, the results
should be published.
 
The main worry is that the software, being produced by Westinghouse, an
American company, is so large and complex that it is impossible to verify that
is would react as it should if the reactor behaved dangerously.
 
A simpler system would be easier to verify and to maintain.  But it would be
difficult, though not impossible, to find a politically acceptable route
whereby the existing system could be scrapped and development started again
from scratch.
 
The software is thought to have reached its size because it has many extra
features which, although desirable, have complicated its structure and blurred
the distinction between the software which controls the nuclear reactor and
that which protects it.
 
David Hunns, superintending inspector at the NII, and one of the authors of the
recent paper, says that this distinction is "fundamental".  Nuclear Electric
insists that independence between the two systems "is fully maintained".
 
Mr Hunns adds: "We don't think it [the system] should be scrapped.  We believe
a safety case can be made.  But it has to be proven.  We have made a judgement.
It's an honest and it's heart-searched judgement.  We've looked hard at the
technology - all the aspects that we possibly can.  We've developed a rationale
that is expressed [in the paper].  Providing the elements of that frame work
are fulfilled that [Nuclear Electric] will make it.  If they are not fulfilled,
they won't.  Then maybe they will wish they had started in  another direction."

  [Subsequent to the above, the following appeared -- giving what I thought to
  be a very good introduction to the complex problem of testing, and how it
  relates to the Sizewell B Nuclear Power Station.]
 
>From the London Independent on Sunday, October 13, 1991
 
A Complex Problem of Tests, by Susan Watts, Technology Correspondent
 
Software engineers agree that it is not safe to assume that software will
always operate correctly - especially in systems such as nuclear power stations
where people's lives are at risk if the software fails.
 
But computer programs are notoriously difficult to verify.  The chief anxiety
over the protection system for Sizewell B is that it is very large and complex.
This bucks the trend in safety critical software, which is to built small,
simple systems.
 
It is usually impossible to test software for all combinations of the inputs it
may receive - say from the reactor in a nuclear power station.  It would take
thousands of years to test the most simple system.
 
An alternative approach is to rely on statistical analysis of the system to
give probabilities of its reliability.  This would involve running the system
for long enough to get an idea of the chances of it failing.  But even this
could take many years for a large system.
 
A more recent technique is to use so-called "formal methods".  This involves
converting the specification for a piece of software into a precise
mathematical model of the requirements to "prove" that it works.  But formal
methods are a new idea;  the software for Sizewell B began life some eight
years ago, when the concept of formal methods was embryonic.
 
David Hunns, superintending inspector at the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate
and co-author of a recent paper on protection systems for Sizewell B, says the
case for insisting on formal methods is not clear cut.  In his paper Mr Hunns
says "the NII has accepted that is not reasonably practicable to achieve their
incorporation for Sizewell B".
 
He adds that the viability of a second best approach, which involves
"backfitting" the mathematical techniques of formal methods to a completed
piece of software, also "remains unresolved".
 
Independent software engineers disagree.  This method of backfitting is being
used to verify software at a nuclear reactor in Darlington in Canada with a
similar, although far smaller, computer-based protection system.
 
Nuclear Electric has designed its system such that is should fail no more that
once in every 10,000 "demands" (a demand is when the reactor is in a state
where the software should shut it down).
 
It is just about feasible that a system with such a failure rate could be
simulated by building another  computer program to replicate the reactor,
hooking that up to the protection software and physically testing whether the
protection system behaves as it is designed to.  This approach would be
time-consuming, and expensive.
 
Nuclear Electric is building a scaled down version of such a test system, and
expects results next summer.  The test involves a prototype of one channel of
the protection software, but will not run for long enough to be described as
exhaustive.  Mt Hunns insists that if the simulation shows the software
contains an unacceptable number of errors, NII will ask Nuclear Electric to
extend the test.

Subject: Thermostat failure mode

I have a typical electronic setback thermostat installed.  A couple of nights
ago it failed "on", causing my furnace to run and run, until my three-year-old
woke up and came to tell me that she was hot.  The temperature had reached 92
degrees(F).

The thermostat itself had decided that it was still 68 degrees(F).  Rebooting
the thermostat by removing and re-inserting the batteries made it get back in
touch with reality.  I replaced the batteries too, but, considering it had
enough power to run the LCDs, that's probably not it.

There are electronic setback thermostats that mount over existing mechanical
(mercury switch) thermostats.  I always thought it was silly to have a little
motor move the arm up and down to cycle the furnace.  But now I have to wonder
about what temperature my electronically-controlled furnace would be driven my
house to before either reaching thermal equilibrium or igniting or melting
something, especially if left to itself over a vacation.  (I don't know yet
whether the furnace itself has its own thermal shutdown, but I doubt it.)  At
least with a mercury switch in there, the most extreme setting is probably
still below where my good old all-electronic device would have taken my house.

I recently caught a television programme on Channel 4 in the UK called "Who

programme dealt with some of the issues of software in fly-by-wire commercial
aircraft, particularly the `human factors' problem. A number of notable people
in the aviation field were interviewed.

I wrote to Channel 4 and asked if I could have a transcript of the programme,
and permission to post excerpts to RISKS ("RISKS is a highly regarded
international forum on software safety .. blah blah .. welcome comment .. blah

I believe these programmes to be sensationalist, interested in viewing figures
rather than rational discussion of the issues.

The other day, my wife called our local bank to discuss refinancing a 
loan. Her call was transferred to a loan officer, and she made an 
appointment for us to meet at the bank to discuss matters. When we got 
there, nobody at the bank had ever heard of the loan officer. It finally 
developed that the loan officer was based at another branch 35 miles away. 

When transferring phone calls within a company's phone system is so easy,
customers have no way of knowing that "the bank" they were talking to was
somewhere else. Perhaps phone systems could be designed for the office
personnel to be notified when a call has been transferred from another
location, by a special ring or tone on the line.

Subject: AT&T Outage

It is easy to focus on the proximate causes of accidents and even on the
general system level causes.  But the recent AT&T outage in NY is a perfect
opportunity to ask a question about very high level causes that has bothered
me for a while. Can the recent rash of failures in the phone system be traced
to divestiture and price competition in the phone business?  When new
technology (such as software of fiber optic cables) fails it is hard to
address this question.  But here we had a failure in one of the oldest
technologies in the business.  So we can ask the specific questions: Have
procedures or staffing levels in "power" changed since divestiture?  Would
pre-divestiture procedures or staffing levels have prevented the recent
outage?

I have no particular knowledge of this area.  Perhaps someone who does would
care to address my question.

Why have an all-or-nothing user interface?  If you're at 105% of design
tolerance for G force, it isn't the same thing as exceeding the design by
200%.  Tell the pilot by how far the design is being pushed, and let them

Despite the possible consequences of system design (including software) faults, 
it is still the case that fire, flood, and other "natural" disasters can be 
far more disastrous for a computer system, particularly a centralised one. 

Earlier this week, the London Evening Standard carried a very small paragraph 
reporting a fire at Hitchin College of Further Education. This drew my 
attention, since it is a few miles from my home, and my ex-wife works there as 
a secretary. 

The fire started at 2 a.m., and was not discovered for an hour. By then the
building complex housing the total computing facilities of the college, both
educational and administrative, had been gutted. The back-up tapes, needless to
say, were stored on-site, close to the computers, in a non-fireproof cupboard.

Total damage to computer equipment was quoted in the paper as 10 million 
pounds. This seemed a bit high to me (for a moderately-sized college with 
no large mainframe), and the figure probably includes other damage (library, 
dance studios, video equipment, etc., etc.) and a finger-in-the-air guess at 
consequential loss. The last item seems to be incalculable, however, given 
that the college's financial and student records have all been wiped out. 
It is on the cards that Hitchin College will cease to exist as a separate 
institution. 

My ex-wife was surprised that the college had not been regularly exchanging 
back-up media with its associated institutions in Letchworth and elsewhere. 
I replied that this is exactly what I recalled ICL doing: 3-level back-up 
cycled every day between sites, and all tapes stored in locked fire-proof 
safes. I then recalled why ICL adopted this admirable policy. In the early 
70s they lost an entire installation, including all back-up, when the night 
operator dropped a cigarette into a waste-paper basket. 

Do we always have to learn the hard way?

Granted --- but the system administrator should check these actions both when
installing the system and periodically thereafter.  (I do so once a month; a
more secure environment would require more frequent checks.)

That many novice Unix sysadmins do not check their crontabs (by the way, you
neglected to mention the V7 and BSD /usr/lib/crontab) is a RISK, but is in
essence their fault.  That modern "plug-and-play" Unixes do not provide an easy
means to do this for the novice sysadmin is a contributory factor; this can be
likened to the off-and-on "fly by wire" discussion on this list ("system
administration by wire"?).  Modern Unix systems do not take this into
consideration, mainly because the systems of the past did not --- but those
systems required competent system administrators anyway, so it was not a
problem then.

Subject: Friendly (?) viruses (Meyer, RISKS-12.47)

I think you are taking me a bit TOO literally.  True, there are things which
run on 'my' systems which I don't explicitly know about each instance of.
There are also things (user programs) which I generally don't know about
at all, but which are necessary to our service.

The point is that (as an admin), for every 'proper' thing running on the
system I can, if necessary, point a finger at who is responsible for it,
who DOES know about it (if I don't), and who is responsible for making
sure it behaves sensibly (if that's not me).  It's not that I know everything
that is happening, but I can, without needing to use heroic or unusual
procedures, find out what I need to know about it, and where I can get
help if required, in order to ensure continued service.

>It also seems that an automatic or semi-automatic bug correction service,
>working somewhat in the style of mail and news (that is to say, updating remote
>files in controlled conditions) wouldn't be such an absurdity as he suggests. 

The salient points here are your 'in controlled conditions', and (in a bit
I've cut) providing that the machine owner/operator/administrator has
`subscribed' to such a service.  (And that the group providing the service can
control it to ensure that only those sites which want it get it.  We don't
even install official manufacturer-provided upgrades without first evaluating
them under test conditions, to make sure they don't interact unfortunately
with other things we run.  It's surprising how often something can't be put up
exactly as supplied, without requiring other work.  I've long been in favor of
automagic DISTRIBUTION of bugfixes, rather than having to wait for the
semi-annual release tape.  But, with the present state of the art, I want to
look at them before I put them in.)

In a closed, time-shared system, if the kernel is secure, all of the kernel
mode communications are secure.  In a network environment, kernel messages
must travel over communication paths which are not guaranteed to be secure.
How long would a time-shared OS remain secure if user programs could monitor
queries made by kernel mode system calls to kernel databases?

By this line of reasoning, public key encryption is essential to the
development of reliable network based computing systems.  If you can't rely on
secure communications to distribute a key, there is not an alternative.
Distributed networks are almost by definition insecure.
