Subject:  Benefits and Risks of Knowledge-Based Systems

Readers of RISKs might be interested in a recent Oxford University Press
paperback book "Benefits and Risks of Knowledge-Based Systems" (ISBN
0-19-584743-9). This is a 76-page Report of a Working Party of the (UK-based)
Council for Science and Society, chaired by Professor Margaret Boden (Prof of
Philosophy and Psychology at the School of Cognitive and Computing Sciences,
University of Sussex).

The main chapter headings are:

1 How Knowledge-Based Systems Work

2 Applications of KBSs

3 The Benefits and Dangers of KBSs

4 Influencing the Future Uses of KBSs

5 Conclusions and Recommendations


Summarizing the final conclusions and recommendations:

1 The general level of public awareness about the applications and social
implications of KBS is low, and education about KBS should be included in
school courses.

2. There should be more interdisciplinary undergraduate and postgraduate study
programs in cognitive sciences and KBSs.

3. A government initiative applying KBSs to health education and health care
would be popular and in the long term cost-effective.

4. A KBS should complement human workers rather than replace them.

5. It is undesirable to substitute a computer for a human function, such as the
giving of psychiatric help, that should involve respect, understanding, empathy
or love between humans.

6. Great attention should be given to the immense hazards presented by possible
malfunctioning of military command and control systems and autonomous
decision-making programs.

7. The Data Protection Act should entitle people to know not only what data are
held about them, but also the rules by which they are processed.

8. Statutary regulation of KBS standards may be needed in future.

9. KBS vendors should adopt a suitable Code of Practice.

10. Meanwhile they should be legally obliged to insure themselves against
claims for damages by users.

11 Various industry standards are needed, especially in the interface
between the program and the user.

12 Professional associations such as the Society for the Study of Artificial
Intelligence and the Simulation of Behaviour, and the Expert Systems Group of
the BCS should adopt a code of conduct for their members.

13 Setting up a formal body for KBS practitioners with restricted membership is
*not* recommended.

I find it amusing that this user likes the system, despite its apparently

Subject: New Bank Software => Problems

Today I called my bank (Bank of the West) to transfer some money from one
account to another.  Before initiating the transfer, I asked for the balance in
the source account.  The amount the teller said was in my account seemed
somewhat high, but in the right ballpark.  Since I hadn't balanced my checkbook
recently and since it covered the amount I was about to transfer out, I
initiated the transfer, thanked the teller, and hung up.

Immediately after getting off the phone, I balanced my checkbook, and realized
that the amount she had read to me was about $2K too high (though the correct
amount still covered the transfer).  I called back immediately, this time
getting a different bank worker.  I told her that the amount I had been given
earlier was incorrect.  She said that the bank had just installed "new
software" the previous day, and all account balances were temporarily wrong
until "things sort themselves out", which would be a day or so.  She said that,
unfortunately, not all the bank's employees were aware of the problem.

I wonder what "until things sort themselves out" means.  "Until all
transactions recorded in the old system are entered into the new one", perhaps?
If so, why didn't they do this before putting the new system on-line to
workers?  Maybe "until bugs in the software are fixed?"  If so, their testing
of the new software was seriously inadequate.

The RSRE Viper microprocessor and Avra Cohn's report on its formal
verification, have been discussed earlier in RISKs. Readers may therefore be
interested in the following article, by Simon Hill, which appeared on p.3 of
the (UK) Computer Weekly for July 5, 1990. It is reprinted here in its
entirety, without permission.

::  
::  Teknis International Railroad Systems of Adelaide, Australia, is
::  seeking assurances that the Viper technology can meet the claims that

::  
::  Teknis, which is developing a signal and railway crossing control
::  system using Viper for the Australian National Railway Commission, is
::  also threatening action against the MoD's commercial licensee, Charter
::  Technologies.
::  
::  Worcester-based Charter was licensed in january 1988 to exploit
::  commercially the fruits of the Viper work carried out at the Royal
::  Signals and Radar Establishment at Malvern.
::  
::  Ron Davison, Teknis' business development manager, says, *We are
::  looking for every comfort we can get from the development and
::  suppliers of Viper:.
::  
::  Davison says the A$12m Australian railways project "is a world first"
::  in the safety-critical market, making the first time that Viper has
::  found a user outside the military and defence communities.
::  
::  Teknis' concern has been inspired by a series of reports in UK and US
::  academic circles about RSRE and Charter's claims that Viper is
::  formally verified for use in safety-critical applications where lives
::  may be put at risk if the technology fails.
::  
::  Davison says he is "surprised at the sudden rash of reports about
::  Viper coming out of the woodwork" 18 months after Teknis began work
::  with the chip.
::  
::  But the report that is most critical of Viper, written by Avra Cohn of
::  Cambridge University's computer laboratory, is two years old.  It was
::  published in May 1988 and delivered to RSRE, but Charter technologies
::  claims it was not shown Cohn's findings until mid-1989.
::  
::  RSRE and Charter claim that Viper is formally specified, with a chip
::  design which conforms to this specification.  Cohn says in the report
::  that this is misleading.
::  
::  "Such assertations, taken as assurances of the impossibility of design
::  failure in safety-critical applications, could have catastrophic
::  results," Cohn says in the report.
::  
::  The MoD says "It is a matter of interpretation of the words used to
::  describe the dependabiliity of Viper.  Nothing can be described as
::  absolutely fail safe."
::  
::  This year a report by US consultants Computational Logic for US space

::  report dated June 1989, obtained by Computer Weekly, the former chief
::  RSRE scientist on the Viper projects, John Cullyer, has indicated his
::  agreement with Nasa's conclusions.  Cullyer is now Professor of
::  Electronics at Warwick University.
::  
::  The MoD cannot say whether the Nasa and Cohn reports have been looked
::  at by RSRE staff, but a spokesman says, "Work is continuing to

::  
::  Marconi has asked the MoD to respond to the Cohn and Nasa reports, but

Subject: Cellphone risk to ABS?

The following appears in an article advising against the use of cellular
telephones in aircraft (it's illegal in most countries), published in Flight
Safety Bulletin (the quarterly journal of the General Aviation Safety Committee
in the UK):

"As a point of interest, the manufacturers of some mobile telephones have
issued a warning that they should not be used in cars fitted with an
electronic anti-lock braking system (ABS) because the cellphone could cause
the system to malfunction."

Presumably the risk is from EMI.

Does any RISKS reader have details on this? Is it just a precautionary
warning to limit legal liability, or is there evidence? If this is a real
risk, what about coaches, trains, other nearby vehicles ...?

The following is taken from an article by Kevin Eason in the (London) Times of
July 9th:

     A safety alert has been issued to thousands of mobile telephone
     engineers after an incident in which a Jaguar car lost all power
     because of faulty telephone installation.  The driver escaped
     safely when all electrical systems, including lights, brakes and
     engine, were shut down by a crossed wire. 
     
     Jaguar drivers were warned yesterday to use only car phones
     fitted and checked by company dealers.  The Federation of
     Communications Services has alerted its 350-member companies
     which handle mobile communications equipment that faulty
     installation could damage vital equipment, especially anti-lock
     braking systems (ABS), and urges them to check with manufacturer
     specifications.  
     [...]
     
     The Jaguar driver involved was stranded on a motorway when all
     power to the car failed.  Checks on the vehicle showed that a
     telephone engineer had crossed vital wires which caused a
     complete systems shutdown. 
     
     Most new cars now have complex computer engine management systems
     and increasing numbers have electronic controls for suspension,
     brakes, gearbox and safety mechanisms.  The new Mercedes SL
     convertible sports car, for example, has an automatic pop-up roll
     bar operated by computer.

Subject: Washington State Ferries slide into home

	I unfortunately had a Hertz rental car on Orcas Island, Washington,
when a Washington State Ferry rammed the Island's only car ferry dock and
knocked it out of service for a minimum of several days. The incident raised
several interesting points:

	1) Hertz had no category for this case; they repeatedly told
us "If the car were broken, then you could fly off the island and get
another car, and retrieving your car would be our problem. But since
you say it isn't BROKEN, every day your car sits on the island is a day
you are renting it... and of course if we have to pick it up there you get
a retrieval fee, a fee for renting one-way, etc etc".

	2) It would be interesting to get more informed information about
how the ferries work. From the June 29, 1990 Seattle Times:

	"All indications point to a failure in the vessel's computer-control
system. Inspectors will attempt to recreate the situation which caused the
computer failure, but 'often these computer glitches have a tendency not to
reappear'. ... The six Issaquah-class ferries ... were built in the late '70s
and early '80s and have been plagued by propulsion-control problems. The
system's top engineer in 1986 ... said then that the propulsion systems
were so unpredictable that if he had his way he would replace them. Last
year the state awarded a $550,000 contract ... to do design work for the
ferry system, including modifications on the Issaquah-class propulsion-
control system. ... Unlike the original propulsion system which controls
and reverses the variable-pitch propellers on the diesel-engine ferries
through a computer, the new system is simpler and more reliable ... ."

	From what I could gather from talking to the Seattle Times reporters
covering the incident, the ferries have a "fly by wire" propulsion system that
among other things does automatic docking. Occasionally the propulsion-control
computer hiccups, locking the controls for a few seconds. Normally this is no
bid deal, but in this case the computer system had the bad timing to hiccup
just as the ferry was supposed to start braking for the final stage of docking
at Orcas. As a result the ferry didn't brake at all and ploughed straight into
the terminal, causing $250,000 in damage. (Also costing island merchants much
of their July 4 weekend tourist revenue, and severely inconveniencing many
unlucky tourists. We eventually managed to get our Hertz car off the island
by private barge.)

Subject: Logica Code Slows Trident
Organization: Canon Research Europe, Guildford, UK

This is from the July 19 issue of Computer Weekly:

    The 9 billion pound Trident nuclear warhead programme is being held up
  because of serious problems with a computer system, developed by Logica,
  that keeps highly volatile nuclear materials apart during weapon assembly.
    The system, which ensures the safe movement and records the exact
  whereabouts of plutonium and other materials around two buildings at the
  Ministry of Defence's Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) at Aldermaston,
  is only able to handle half the volumes set by the MoD.  Despite this, the
  system went live on July 13.
    [...]
    The system is a high integrity movement control package, using Stratus
  fault-tolerant hardware, used in A45 and A90, the two buildings at AWE
  involved in Trident development work.
    One source says that the MoD has set a target for the system to handle
  200 units of nuclear material within the two buildings at any one time,
  but that the present system can only handle 100 units.
    The source says that the MoD and AWE have been revising the target
  downwards, but that Logica has been unable to meet the new figure.
    [...]
    A Logica spokeswoman says it is not company policy to comment on
  projects which have not been announced.

Yes, this is the same Logica that ran into trouble during a project for
San Fransisco's transit system.

Subject: GAO slams FAA computer systems

According to a story by Jeffrey A. Perlman in the 'Los Angeles Times' 18
July 1990, the General Accounting Office has issued a new report entitled
"Air Traffic control -- Inadequate Planning Increases Risk of Computer
Failures in Los Angeles."

The GAO says that in planning for a 1995 consolidation of Southern
California radar tracking facilities, FAA officials have refused to
consider computer solutions that could solve their computer problems
because the agency does not want to rewrite or develop software to run on
new, state-of-the-art hardware and expend the "additional time they believe
would be required to undertake such an effort."  

A 1989 GAO report singled out the Los Angeles - Orange County air space as
having the worst comuter-related aircraft tracking problems.  The new
report criticizes the FAA for ignoring the situation, saying air traffic
controllers may find their radar screens flickering, showing insufficient
data or blanking out at critical moments.

FAA officials "are still analyzing the GAO report and had no formal reply."

A short item in 'Business Week', July 30:

      BMW PUTS A BACKSEAT DRIVER ON A CHIP
    
The latest cars offer a plethora of computerized wonders -- like chips that
control the engine or warn you is a door is ajar.  But would anyone want a
computer that took over control of a car if it judged the vehicle was being
driven too fast or improperly for road conditions?  BMW engineers are
betting the answer is yes.
   
They've already installed an early version of their Heading Control system
in cars at the auto company's research center in Munich.  A camera above
the rearview mirror tracks the center stripe and the line along the right
side of the road.  If a driver gets too close to either marker, a small
electric motor integrated into the steering system is activated to put
things right.  Later versions will gauge road conditions and differentiate
between broken and solid lines, so the computer can tell such things as
whether it's okay to pass.  Drivers being corrected might feel a tug on the
wheel.  But they can easily override the computer by continuing with
wahtever they are doing.  BMW engineers say the system is at least five
years from market.  And they predict that once customers get used to the
idea, they'll love it.

Subject: British air defense computer suffers a "nervous breakdown"

>From the Reuters news wire:

BRITISH AIR DEFENSE COMPUTER SUFFERING A  "NERVOUS BREAKDOWN" 
    LONDON, Reuter - A nearly half-billion dollar computer
designed to mastermind Britain's future air defenses won't be
fit for action for another 10 years because of bouts of nervous
confusion, Defense Ministry officials said Wednesday.
    The $448.8 million system known as ICCS -- Improved UK Air
Defense Ground Environment Command and Control System -- was due
to enter service in 1987. But officials told Parliament's
defense committee the computer's problems with logic would delay
operation by up to 10 years.
     "We get wrong answers sometimes and the bugs have to be
tracked down and sorted out,"  Donald Spiers, who heads aircraft
control at the ministry, told the committee.
     "Secondly, from time to time it crashes. What this means is
the equivalent of a nervous breakdown. It becomes confused with
the information and goes wrong." 
    The production consortium, made up of Hughes Aircraft,
Marconi and Siemens-Plessey, have upgraded the main computers
driving the system to give more power, Spiers said.
    ICCS was designed as the sophisticated equivalent of the war
tables used during World War II when model planes were pushed
around a board.
    It will coordinate radar, fighters, surface-to-air missiles
and air command centers through a single network.
    The system is being developed on a fixed price contract and
Spiers said all extra costs had to be met by the consortium.
    He said the companies had not been paid for the past two
years because of the problems encountered.

Subject: British Rail signalling software problem

>From the Guardian, Mon. 23rd July, front page:

Headline: BR signalmen 'worked blind'

Subhead:  Computer software problems admitted at key commuter train centre

By-line:  Patrick Donovan, Transport Editor

British Rail has admitted that computer software problems have been uncovered
at a signal centre which controls London's busiest commuter lines. They left 
operators "working blind" after train movements were wiped off control screens
on at least one occasion over the last five weeks.

A BR spokesman said newly installed software, responsible for flashing up the
position of trains on the indicator screens of signal operators at Wimbledon,
has been found to contain two technical faults.

The Wimbledon centre controls 90 mph services south of Waterloo and includes
the Clapham Junction area, where 35 people died in a train accident in December
1988.

Faulty wiring on a signalling modernisation programme was found to have caused
the crash.

BR said one of the faults uncovered on the indicator screen software has not yet
been fully rectified. An internal investigation began after an operator found
that the system was providing "the wrong information". Realising that he had 
lost track of train movements, the operator immediately turned all signals to 
red.

A spokesman said that at no time was any train at risk. "What happened caused
concern to the signalman." But he stressed that the mechanical signal equipment
and all other equipment worked normally, bringing all trains to an immediate
standstill after the problem was discovered.

"The problem was caused by computer software fault in the signal box. [sic - PM]
It gave the wrong indication to the signal man. All the trains froze where they
were. The lights told him that something was different to what was happening
[outside]."

BR conceded that the faulty equipment served a vital function, "this little
piece of software tells the signalman what is happening outside".

The software faults were found inside the panel in the train indicator box in a
system responsible for operating the lights.

Alastair Wilson, contracts and production director of E. B. Signal, the 
manufacturers, said: "The system is under test. I do emphasise that things are 
going through a testing stage. It is not unusual to have minor software bugs."
[!!! - PM]

A spokesman for the National Union of Railwaymen said that any operational 
shutdown of train indicator screens would "at best create a major disruption
and at worst could create alarming safety hazards. If everything goes to red it
puts enormous pressures on an individual signalman."

[Remainder of article omitted. It goes on about unrelated signalling problems
in the Clapham Junction area, including a loss of communication between Waterloo
and Wimbledon signal centres, concern about the growing use of driver-only 
services on Network SouthEast, contradictions in the rule-book about whether or
not such services may operate with a defective radio, and the need for the 
driver to draft competent members of the public to assist him in ensuring safety
after an emergency stop.]

A few comments:

The report is rather confused, but it seems that the system receives information
about the position of every train in the region, and displays this to the
signalmen in the form of lights moving over a large indicator board. The bugs
were in the hardware/software module which drives the display, so it was a case
of "correct information in, garbage out". 

I wonder if the faulty module was rated as "safety-critical" in the hazard 
analysis.

It would be nice to know *how* the signalman knew that he was being given
wrong information, and what would have happened if he had not been so alert,
and continued to operate the network with the wrong information.

It is amusing to hear the manufacturer refer to a bug which brings an entire
railway regional network to a standstill for some time as "minor". Perhaps he
meant that only a few lines of code were in error! Somebody should have a word
with him about how to classify faults and failures!

If, as the manufacturer states, the system is under test, why was it being run
to control live traffic without any back-up system? Surely BR's testing
strategy can't be "Let the train take the strain"? (To quote one of their own
advertising slogans!)

Subject: Call for Papers on Testing, Analysis and Verification

                         CALL FOR PAPERS

          Symposium on Testing, Analysis and Verification 

        Victoria, British Columbia, Canada     October 8-10, 1991
                  Sponsored by ACM Sigsoft

The purpose of this meeting is to bring together researchers and 
practitioners who are working in the areas of software analysis, 
testing, and formal verification.  Papers and panel session proposals 
are invited on current and emerging techniques, strategies, processes 
and tools for determining the presence or absence of errors in software 
and for inferring other characteristics of software quality.

Papers should be a maximum of 5000 words in length.  They should present 
a clear picture of the original contributions made by the paper, while 
also carefully relating the work presented to the work of others.  The 
highest quality papers from the symposium may be considered for 
publication in a special issue or section of a research journal.

Authors should send six copies of their paper or panel proposal to the 
Program Committee Chair, Nancy Leveson, at the address below.
Papers must be received by March 1, 1991.
Authors will be notified of acceptance by May 15, 1991.
Camera-ready papers are due not later than July 1, 1991.
