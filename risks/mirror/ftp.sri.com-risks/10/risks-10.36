Subject: Railway Safe Working - large analogue systems

One area in which safety and reliability of analogue systems is well-understood
is railway safe working. Risks readers will certainly find L.T.C. Rolt's book
"Red for Danger" interesting and instructive. It covers the development of safe
working in the U.K.  from the first railways to the late Sixties (my edition
anyway).  There are many good examples of risks unnoticed, risks fixed badly,
re-appearing risks, and the work it takes to make people realize the risks and
then pay the price of fixing them.

Given the long experience in the U.K with safety in railway systems, you might
wonder why accidents such as Purley happen. It puzzles me too.  BR has the
technology to detect, on the train, the state of trackside signals, but only
uses it, in the first instance, to inform the driver.  In Australia (at least
NSW) signals are equipped with a small handle which pivots up when the signal
is at red and contacts a trip on the brake system if a train attempts to pass
it. The driver cannot subvert the systemin motion, although he can reset the
system and proceed once the train has fully stopped. This can only be done from
outside the train (by climbing down to the trip and manually resetting it).
This seems to be much more consistent with the rest of the safe working system,
where signal box interlocks are implemented by requiring two largish pieces of
metal to occupy the same space for conflicting events to occur. The only
failure mode here is severe deformation of the metal rods.

Of course, this kind of absolute block working is not always appropriate.  In
places where it is common to want to pass a red signal (dense suburban) extra
arms are installed between signals. These drop in sequence at a rate which
reduces the train speed to around 20 km/h.  Again there is no way to go faster
without overunning a raised arm.

Suburban trains have the usual dead-man's throttle handle (the throttle must be
pressed down continuously for it to work on the brakes not to be applied), but
long distance diesels have a vigilance button which must be pressed every sixty
seconds to keep the brakes off. It's a good thing that brakes are applied
automatically because it is commonly believed that old hands can press this
button even when sleeping. I've observed the automaton-like way that drivers
press this button and I have no doubt that it happens. So I remain surprised
that BR didn't seem to believe that train crew vigilance could be a problem.

Mind you, it all seems very safe compared to Canada where express passenger
trains are managed using CTC and walkie-talkie radios. I've seen passenger
trains following one another, separated by a few hundred yards, and relying
purely on the vision of the driver in the second train. Authorized by radio, no
hardware protection.

Michael Snyder's message about the Road Runner problem, i.e., that the system
may not be able to cope with roads that go into mountains, can be a serious
one.  If people rely on the system enough that they tend to take their hands of
the wheel and stop watching the road, then they could get in big trouble if
they suddenly come to a construction site.  Especially if they are moving along
quickly in their BMW :-)

In other words, if the system is good enough to give people confidence, but is
not good enough to deal with all possible situations, then it is risky.

Let's dispose of the supposition that this is a RISC/CISC issue.  Arne
Helme <arne@sfd.uit.no> reposted "crashme" to the comp.arch newsgroup,
and obtained a flurry of reports:

Obviously, some RISCs crashed, some CISCs crashed, some RISCs

The problem most likely is an OS bug. Chris Torek remembers the discussion as
follows: "on all the machines that crashed *except one*, it was a bug in the OS
and not in the chip.  The one exception?  A CISC."

One person said that, but is it true?  I find it hard to believe that excluding
undefined behavior would necessarily exact a performance penalty.  Further,
another person in that same discussion said that the types of bugs causing the
RISC machines to crash were typical of early hardware bugs in CISC machines
too, and that the reason the RISC machines were crashing was because the simply
weren't as thoroughly debugged as the CISC machines.

I don't know who's right, but both explanations seem equally plausable.  It
seems premature to lose sleep over RISC robustness at this point.

Subject: Robustness of RISC architectures

I don't believe this is a RISC versus CISC issue. The "execute-random-data"
program found an *OS* bug in both our (RISC) MIPS boxes and our CISC Sun 3/50s.

On the MIPS the behaviour of some instruction in the conditional branch format
is undefined. If there is an illegal FP instruction in the delay slot of such
an undefined branch instruction. The FP instruction traps to the OS which
determines the FP instruction is in a delay-slot and tries to calculate
the branch destination. The OS routine called to do this detects the branch
instruction is undefined but does the wrong thing, it calls "panic" halting
the machine. Trivial to fix.

On our SUN 3/50s (running SunOS 4.1) some random code sequences result
in a cpu-bound process which can not be killed. Rebooting is the only solution.

Its possible that OS bugs are more prevalent on RISCs because their OSs are
younger.

Subject: Re: Robustness of RISC architectures

In fairness, it should be noted that most of these crashes appear to have
been the result of *software* problems:  the operating system was not
prepared to cope with this bizarre situation when the hardware noticed it.

Very few RISC designers (none that I know of, in fact) are that stupid.
Yes, RISC architectures often state that the results of certain sequences
are undefined, but wedging the machine is *not* considered a legitimate
result.  (Not in a machine meant to support multi-user systems, at any
rate; the rules are different for some of the more specialized processors.)
Claims to the contrary are the result of ignorance or ulterior motives.

This is simply a question of proper design, not of RISC vs CISC.  Certain
early and buggy releases of a certain CISC processor were notorious for
bugs in the protection system, e.g. circumstances in which a memory
fetch would be done with "system" permissions when it was initiated
from "user" state, or vice-versa.  This was mostly a result of the great
complexity of the processor and its interactions with memory management;
a similar problem would have been rather less likely on a RISC machine.
So it cuts both ways.

It is necessary to understand that "known" and "viable" are two different
criteria, analogous to the frequently-mentioned-on-Risks distinction between
correct functioning and safe functioning.  It is not necessary that the result
of violating the rules be precisely defined and the same for all variants of a
particular architecture; what is required is merely that none of the possible
results endanger system integrity.

This was shown to be a OS bug on the DECstations (The OS could not correctly
resume a process that trapped just after a delayed branch and instead of 
killing the process panicked). One person also reported that his 386 (a CISC 
processor) could be crashed with the same program (He did not say which 
UNIX he used, however. My 386 running 386/ix did not crash).

And talking of VAXes. You can crash a VAX under ULTRIX by loading the frame
pointer with a negative value and then trapping into the OS.

Subject: Re: Robustness of RISC architectures

Many RISC architectures have a notion of a well-defined instruction 
stream, and undefined instruction sequences may exhibit undefined
behaviour. Whether this is a real RISK, as usual, depends on a host
of other factors and assumptions relating to the total system of which the
RISC processor is only a part. Here are a few that come to mind:

 o You are not supposed to write (much) assembly code on a RISC. Therefore
   if the compiler is "safe" (i.e. never generates illegal instruction
   sequences) , and object code is protected read-only, executing undefined
   instruction sequences is unlikely. Note that a "safe" compiler need
   not be correct. This idea is not new: these assumptions were necessary
   for the B5000/B6000 series of Burroughs computers of the '60s which had
   unsafe user-mode object code but relied on certified compilers.

 o If the processor is used in a single user application (e.g. an
   embedded application) then there is little difference between just the
   application program failing and the whole processor failing. Both
   may result in byzantine failures for instance.

 o One can question the complexity needed for operating system and compiler
   software as a result of the RISC approach. OS code must perform much
   more work on traps and interrupts than on a typical CISC machine,
   and compiler optimizations are required to realize most of the 
   performance benefits of RISC. Clearly these are not impossible
   requirements but my experience suggests that it takes several years
   *after* a RISC machine is introduced for the OS and compiler software
   to become robust.

A particularly bad scenario could be a multi-user university computer that is
used for a student compiler writing course and for payroll!

There was more than one report of a CISC machine that crashed.  The blame
was lain by some at the (possibly undefined) behaviour of some instruction
sequences of RISC machines, but no proof was given.  It is much more likely
that the machines crash because of bugs in the operating system.  (I know
at least one sequence of bytes that will crash a Sun 4 in some situations,
but I also know that it is due to an OS bug.)

The risk is obvious, one part of the system gets the blame, while nobody
looks at the remainder of the system.

I do know what break does: It gets me out of the enclosing switch statement
or loop. This is much less powerfull then EXIT, which does not just leave
this procedure (like C return) but eventually other procedures as well, which
is more than you can do with goto in C (You would have to use setjmp/longjump)
to do this.

Comparing EXIT with break does not make sense. It is a generalized return
(Handy with those nested procedures you have in Pascal).

The danger of break is not that it leaves the switch or loop, but that you
can leave it out were it would belong:

switch (a) {
case A:
	/* code */
case B:
	/* more code */
	break;
default:
	/* even more code	*/
}

Now should there be a break just before 'case B:' ? You have to understand
the algorithm to answer the question.

This can happen with EXIT just as easily.

Software doesn't wear out?  Doesn't that depend on your definitions?

Example: I use a program, duly protected by both copyright, and trade secret 
(of portions not disclosed in the copyright process).  I use that program 
under terms of a valid contract.  The program quits working some first of a 
month, because the contract has expired.  I order up a new copy.  When it 
comes, it is *not* necessarily backwards compatible with my extant data files.

Now, is my program "broken" [worn out] or not?  It may function well by the
*current* definitions of the vendor; but it does not get my work done any 
longer.  (At least, not until I "make the problem fit the new too.")
That sounds like a car that won't start, or run; but no, the trouble 
is *not* covered by the 5/50 warranty either.  Sorry.  (Or, perhaps better 
analogy, the car won't run; and the necessary repair part is no longer made.)

Apparently, "failure" has varied appearances, in the eye of the designer, (and
perhaps the programmer), the vendor, and the user.

In this situation it seems likely that Programmer A merely covered up or made
allowances for the bug. A real bug fix would have redesigned the code so the
condition that equired the obscure code didn't occur. The original comment is
that fixed bugs stay fixed. Patched bugs can (and often do) resurface.
