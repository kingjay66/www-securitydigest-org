Subject: Serious flaws in electronic voting systems

Johns Hopkins University experts say that high-tech voting machine software
from Diebold Election Systems has flaws that would let voters cast extra
votes and allow poll workers to alter ballots secretly. Aviel D. Rubin,
technical director of the Information Security Institute at Johns Hopkins,
led a team that examined the Diebold software, which has about 33,000 voting
machines operating in the United States. Adam Stubblefield, a colleague of
Rubin's, said that "practically anyone in the country -- from a teenager on
up -- could produce these smart cards that could allow someone to vote as
many times as they like." Diebold has not seen the Institute's report and
would not comment on it in detail, but a company spokesman said: "We're
constantly improving it so the technology we have 10 years from now will be
better than what we have today. We're always open to anything that can
improve our systems." Peter G. Neumann, an expert in computer security at
SRI International, said the Diebold code was "just the tip of the iceberg"
of problems with electronic voting systems.

Subject: South Africa bank Internet spyware and fraud

ABSA, the leading bank in South Africa has very weak Internet security.  All
you have to know is someone's bank account number and their pin, and you can
set up beneficiaries, pay money over, to your heart's content.  There is no
TAN like in German banks.  This story is not surprising at all, what is
surprising is that it took so many years for this to happen on such a big
scale.

Here is the story according to the Sunday Times.  Simple spyware was
installed on victim's computers and the account numbers and PIN sent back to
the perpetrator.  This allowed the thief to steal approximately R500,000
(about US$ 65000) from various victims.
  http://www.sundaytimes.co.za/2003/07/20/news/news01.asp

The bank responded with the usual tips:
  http://www.absa.co.za/ABSA/Media_Releases/Article_Page/0,1551,424,00.html

These were the funniest:

* Make sure that the software that is loaded onto your PC via a third party
is licensed. (How would that make a difference?)

* Update your operating system and browser with the latest Microsoft patches
to protect your PC from exploitation. These can be downloaded from the
Microsoft website http://www.microsoft.com (Assuming of course that everyone
in South Africa uses Microsoft - oh, all the victims used Microsoft!)

I am fairly confident that the police will catch the thief.  You cannot
transfer money out of the country from South Africa without special
clearance, so at least we did not have the problem with money ending up in
some country that would not cooperate.

He will probably be given a death sentence.  (Not directly, but a visit to
our jails is akin to a death sentence through HIV infection :-(

Subject: Stealing passwords from Kinko's

For two years a man stole passwords from customers in New York City Kinko's
copy/printing/office services stores, and used the information to try to
access and open bank accounts:

  "In pleading guilty to computer damage, [Juju] Jiang admitted that,
  between February 14, 2001, and December 20, 2002, without the permission
  of Kinko's Inc., he installed special keylogging software on computer
  terminals located at Kinko's stores throughout Manhattan to
  surreptitiously record keystroking activity on those computers, and
  collect computer usernames and passwords of Kinko's customers.

Jiang also admitted that he then used the confidential information he
obtained to access, or attempt to access, bank accounts belonging to other
persons, and fraudulently open on-line bank accounts.

Jiang also pled guilty to similar fraudulent conduct that he continued to
commit while on bail after his arrest on December 20, 2002."

Subject: New method cracks passwords in seconds

A senior research assistant at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology's
Cryptography and Security Laboratory has published a paper outlining a way
to speed up the process of cracking alphanumeric Windows passwords to only
13.6 seconds on average. The previous average time was 1 minute, 41
seconds. The new method uses massive lookup tables to match encoded
passwords to the original text entered by a person, thus reducing the time
it takes to break the code. "Windows passwords are not very good," says
researcher Phillippe Oechslin. "The problem with Windows passwords is that
they do not include any random information." The only requirement for the
cracker is a large amount of memory in order to accommodate the lookup
tables. The larger the table, the shorter the time it takes to crack the
password. Users can protect themselves by adding nonalphanumeric characters
to a password, which adds another layer of complexity to the process. Any
cracker would then need more time or more memory or both to accomplish the
break-in. For more information on Oechslin's method, check out

Subject: Bypassing the safeguards

On 23 Jul 2003, New York City Councilman James E. Davis was shot to death by
political opponent Othneil Boaz Askew inside New York's City Hall.  Davis
had a concealed handgun of his own.

How did the two opponents get their weapons past the metal detectors?
According to the news report, the councilpersons (and apparently their guests)
routinely bypass the detectors.

Subject: Biometrics technology: not yet ready for primetime

Gartner Research director Anthony Allen told guests at the launch of
European Biometrics Forum that while widespread use of biometrics was likely
by 2008, the technologies still had some kinks to be ironed out.
Biometrics, which includes technologies used for voice, face, iris and
fingerprint identification systems, is virtually useless without adequate
back security measures and databases, said Allen, and current systems have
several fallibilities that must be corrected. For instance, evidence shows
that wearing eyeglasses can fool an eyescanner, prosthetic makeup can
confuse face scanners, a sore throat can change a voice print and breathing
heavily on a fingerprint scanner can make prints unrecognizable. However,
newer generations of technology are beginning to rectify some of these
shortcomings; the latest fingerprint scanners now incorporate methods of
detecting body heat and blood flow and can scan below the surface later,
making it more difficult to deceive.  [*The Register*, 22 Jul 2003; NewsScan

Reuters Internet Report:

  A hoax e-mail was circulating around the Internet on Friday purporting to
  be a new cookery book from British celebrity chef Jamie Oliver dishing up
  recipes from sushi rolls to fish and chips.

Now here's the kicker:

  Penguin Books, the UK publisher for Oliver's books, said it was trying to
  track down the e-mail's author.  It contained a 121-page Microsoft Word
  document attachment replete with color photos, scores of recipes and a
  fictitious title, "The Naked Chef 2."

Subject: Adieu to 'e-mail'?

France's Culture Ministry has announced a ban on the use of the word 
"e-mail" in all government ministries, publications or Web sites and is 
encouraging French Internet users to adopt the term "courriel" when 
referring to electronic mail. Courriel is derived from "courrier 
electronique" -- electronic mail -- and, according to the General 
Commission on Terminology and Neology, the term is "broadly used in the 
press and competes advantageously with the borrowed 'mail' in English." 
However, some Internet industry experts disagree with that assessment: "The 
word 'courriel' is not at all actively used.   Protecting the language is 
normal, but e-mail's so assimilated now that no one thinks of it as 
American," says Marie-Christine Levet, president of French ISP Club 
Internet, who adds that her company has no plans to switch its terminology.

Subject: E-mail harvesting and re-use as a new virus vector?

I've recently received several e-mails from my Dad, with whom I regularly
correspond.  However, the subject lines and message texts were obviously not
intended for me, and I was able to deduce both the intended recipient and
the original time period when the messages were written, which was over a
year ago.  Each such message also contained an e-mail virus.  The headers
indicated the messages originated in Spain (where my Dad is living), but not
from his ISP.

I think this represents a disturbing new trend in virus vectors, the
'harvesting' of messages and correspondence addresses in order to sneak in a
virus disguised as a legitimate message from a trusted correspondent.  I use
Mozilla as my mail reader so of course I see the complete filename
(file.doc.exe) and cannot be tricked into opening it, but people with
Outlook or Outlook Express might easily be fooled.

Is this new, or have I just missed seeing it before?  Anyone else having
this experience?

Subject: Identity theft: a crime that pays?

The number of victims that have fallen prey to identity thieves is severely
underreported, according to a study by Gartner Research, which estimates
that 3.4% of U.S. consumers -- about 7 million adults -- have suffered ID
theft in the past year. Moreover, identity thieves generally get away with
it -- arrests are made in only one out of every 700 cases. "The odds are
really stacked against consumers," says Gartner VP Avivah Litan.
"Unfortunately, they are the only ones with a vested interest in fixing the
problem." Typically, victims of ID theft learn of the crime a year or more
later after it happens -- long after the trail has gone cold. "It is
different from payment fraud, where the thief takes a credit card number and
consumers are innocent until proven guilty. With identity theft, it is the
opposite: Consumers are thought to be guilty until proven innocent," says
Litan. "There is a serious disconnect between the magnitude of identity
theft that innocent consumers experience and the [financial] industry's
proper recognition of the crime. Without external pressure from legislators
and industry associations, financial services providers may not have
sufficient incentive to stem the flow of identity crimes."  [CNet News.com

The risk here is that what is purported to be a way to enhance communication
could actually be a way to do the opposite (Hmmm ... Navigate nine Web pages
instead of sending an e-mail from your mail client to
president@whitehouse.gov ... Gee, which would you choose?).  Is it a muddled
signal from the White House that they want the American public's feedback

Also, it's a handy way for the White House to sort its e-mail---those in
favor of their position and those who are not.  Would then, the President or
his people bother to read and consider the e-mails not favoring the White
House's policy on a certain national/foreign affair?  Would they pay more
attention to those that favor their position?

Would they have an "accurate" number of e-mails in favor of their policies,
but a nebulous one in regards to the e-mails that don't?

White House puts up obstacle course for e-mails
Critics cite burden of additional steps

Do you want to send an e-mail message to the White House?  Good luck.
In the past, to tell President Bush--or at least those assigned to read
his mail--what was on your mind it was only necessary to sit down at a    
personal computer connected to the Internet and dash off an e-mail note to
president@whitehouse.gov.

But this week, Tom Matzzie, an online organizer with the AFL-CIO, discovered
that communicating with the White House has become a bit more daunting. When
he sent an e-mail protest against a Bush administration policy, the message
was bounced back with an automated reply that instructed him to send the
message in a new way.

Under a system deployed on the White House Web site for the first time last
week, those who want to send a message to President Bush must navigate as
many as nine Web pages and fill out a detailed form that starts by asking
whether the message sender supports or differs with White House policy.

The White House says the new system, at http://whitehouse.gov/webmail, is
an effort to be more responsive to the public and offer the administration
"real-time" access to citizen comments.  [...]

You could lose a customer.

I've moved out to Colorado and was pursuing broadband through my phone
company. After they verified that my line was DSL-capable, they gave me a
call and asked what ISP I'd like to use. Helpfully, they suggested that MSN
had the best pricing deal with them.

After I agreed that this would be fine, they asked what user ID I would
like. I said 'jonlasser' would be ideal. The system rejected that and
several other variations due, the support technician decided, to the
three-letter word buried in my last name. She asked if I'd like to pick
another user ID.

I said no, and asked about other service providers I could use with their
service. It turns out that there's an option for those of us who already
have mail/web from elsewhere and just need the broadband, which is really
what I wanted in the first place. But for that decency filter, however, MSN

The article said nothing about "unmanned" tractors.  This equipment is

Farmers also know that things that have nothing to do with GPS can go wrong

allow roaming packs of automated, economically efficient death to go from
