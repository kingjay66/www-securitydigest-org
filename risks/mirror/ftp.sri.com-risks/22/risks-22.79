Subject: The risks of assuming things: German payrolls

The German government has a little problem. Up until now all of the
civil servants have been paid according to a pay scale that is the
same throughout Germany.  The salaries are paid out by the states, but
the federal government determines the pay level. The company SAP has
developed payroll software for the civil service that many states in
German use.  When a new payscale goes into effect, they just issue a
table update, and everything is fine.

Now suddenly the states are rebelling: Berlin has left the fold, and
just this week concocted a wacky payment system. Certain extras are
being cut, others kept, pay is being cut either 8, 10 or 12 percent
depending on what scale people are in, the work week is to be
decreased by 2 hours a week for most of them, etc. etc. No one really
understands it, except that Berlin is broke and is trying to save
money any way it can. The changes are to go into effect immediately -
except that there's the slight problem with the payroll system. It
assumes the same tariffs as everywhere.....

Looks like the folks down at SAP are going to have their vacations
canceled, as they try to whip up programs to institute this payment
schedule change.

Or as a colleague once said many, many years ago: No one can be *that*
crazy....  only to discover a few months later that there really was
someone with a really crazy schema for organizing stuff.

Subject: "Soft walls" will keep hijacked planes at bay

Article in *NewScientist* about an interesting new technique for
keeping airliners from crashing into skyscrapers:
  http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993893

The proposal suggests

  modifying the avionics in aircraft so that the plane would fight any
  efforts by the pilot to fly into restricted airspace. So if a plane
  was flying with a no-fly-zone to the left, and the pilot started
  banking left to enter the zone, the avionics would counter by banking
  right. Lee's system, called "soft walls", would first gently resist
  the pilot, and then become increasingly forceful until it prevailed.
  The risks of this technique I leave as an exercise to the reader.

Subject: "Soft walls" = dangerous avionics?

Edward Lee, at U.C. Berkeley, is proposing to implement no-fly zones
around skyscrapers (and avoid a repeat of the 9/11 massacre) by using
GPS to override the controls of civilian aircraft.  Based on a
database (in the aircraft) of building locations, the on-board
avionics would force the controls of large airplanes to prevent them
from flying into large buildings (with presumably known locations).

There's an interesting article in this week's New Scientist
(http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993893) that talks
about Lee's system and relates it to other ideas for counter-
terrorism.  Interestingly, one advantage that Lee uses is that other
systems require radio links with the ground and therefore "can be
jammed, or hacked into" (while, presumably, GPS cannot?).

Not surprisingly, Lee says that pilots are "openly hostile" to the
idea.

It seems to me that the system falls prey to a weakness that so many
pseudo-security systems do: it's in essence a cooperative system,
rather than a pre-emptive one (by analogy to multitasking in the
computing world).  Even assuming the avionics work flawlessly, it
would be impossible to install the "soft wall" system on every
airplane in the country, let alone the world -- and it only takes one
airplane with the soft-wall avionics missing or disabled, to defeat
the purpose of the whole system.

Subject: Error in E-Mini Dow Futures creates havoc at CBOT, CME

The Wall Street Journal today (7/3/03) reported that a mistaken order on
the Chicago Board of Trade's "e-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average
Futures" caused wild market swings today.

Apparently an order to sell 10,000 contracts instead of 100 was put in by
mistake. This caused the market, which had been on the upswing that day, to
plunge downwards in both the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. Several traders reported assuming that some bad news
such as a terrorist attack had sparked the sell-off.

The RISK of a typo on an electronic system causing financial havoc is
once again made clear.

Subject: Dead-pregnant-men software failure

In a NY Times story about the effects of NY City budget cuts:

  http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/07/nyregion/07BLOC.html?pagewanted=print

(link free until July 13 or so, after that they charge):

Is a discussion of yet another multi-million dollar software
development failure:

 Eight years ago, at the urging of [...] funeral directors, the
 city agreed to develop a computerized registration system [for the
 filing of death certificates].  About $3.2 million was spent to
 design one, according to an audit released on June 23 by the city
 comptroller. Then the plans were abandoned when the prototype system
 developed serious problems, like registering some men as having
 been pregnant when they died. The city now plans to spend $1.8
 million more for project design. The comptroller's audit called
 the aborted plans "a monumental waste" of taxpayer dollars.

The NYC Comptroller's press release announcing the audit is at:

 http://www.comptroller.nyc.gov/press/2001_releases/01-08-055.shtm

Where it is mentioned that the city Health Department, in charge of
the software development, violated both City and State procurement
procedures in using an existing contract with IBM for "computer
maintenance" to develop the new software system.  The full bill
for the system so far is more like $9-$10 million.  The system still
does not work, and the Health Department has issued a new RFP for
the project that does not contain any references to the old system,
so it appears they intend to throw it away.

The audit is available at:

 http://www.comptroller.nyc.gov/bureaus/audit/06-23-03_7A03-073.shtm

The Comptroller quickly reaches to the heart of the matter:

  "[...] the Department did not employ a formal systems development
  methodology or an independent software quality assurance consultant
  [as required by City rules, which] contributed to the apparent
  failure of this project."

Meanwhile, across the river in New Jersey, a similar project was
completed by leveraging an existing Sybase system from the New York
State Department of Health, taking only six months and $250,000.

Subject: Johnson Calls ATM Arrest Error 'Intolerable' (Re: RISKS-22.78)

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A33576-2003Jun25.html

Although this article is focusing more on the local Prince George's
County police force and detective function -- which has gotten a lot
of bad press here in the DC area for quite a long time -- I think the
message that is being missed is that technology can give the exact
opposite result from that intended. Photographs from ATM cameras
linked with ATM card usage and the system clocks are supposed to
provide exact measures of events. However, if the ones using the data
do not carefully collect it and interpret it correctly, then -- as
this article states -- three apparently innocent people are arrested
and held for 22 days. Humans cannot be completely removed from
processes that have severe consequences, but the humans that are left
"in the loop" must understand that what they do has severe
consequences. They should, therefore, be very careful about what the
"system" is telling them. In this case, the detention of the three
innocent people has allowed a killer at least 22 days to get away.

Annoyed by the prospect of a massive new federal surveillance system,
two researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are
celebrating the Fourth of July with a new Internet service that will
let citizens create dossiers on government officials.  The system will
start by offering standard background information on politicians, but
then go one bold step further, by asking Internet users to submit
their own intelligence reports on government officials -- reports that
will be published with no effort to verify their accuracy.  ''It's
sort of a citizen's intelligence agency,'' said Chris
Csikszentmihalyi, assistant professor at the MIT Media Lab.  He and

Awareness (GIA) project as a response to the US government's Total

Subject: FTC Increases Focus on Privacy

Bob Tedeschi, *The New York Times*, 30 Jun 2003

What started more than a year ago as a California teenager's quest for
blue jeans ended this month with a warning shot from the Federal Trade
Commission, which is moving more aggressively against e-tailers seen
as too lax about protecting their customers' privacy.  Online
merchants say they can handle the commission's new scrutiny.  But some
people, including the young man who set off the FTC investigation in
this case, are not so sure. And given that the young man pointed out a
security flaw in another well-known online merchant last week, he may
be right.

In February 2002, Jeremiah Jacks, then a 19-year-old computer
programmer, was set to buy a pair of jeans on the Web site of Guess
Inc. But before entering his credit card information, he took the
unusual step of checking the site's security - not the security pledge
in Guess.com's privacy policy, but the company's actual practices.  In
the site's address bar he entered a string of characters that, on an
insecure site, would produce a page listing the credit card numbers of
the company's customers. The vulnerability, he said, is well known
within the programming community.

It worked. About 200,000 customer names and credit card numbers
appeared in Mr. Jacks's browser. In an interview last week, Mr. Jacks
recalled that he had immediately tried to inform Guess of its
vulnerability to such a break-in [an SQL injection].  Guess.com
ignored his entreaties, he said, and Mr. Jacks soon reported his
discovery to SecurityFocus, an Internet security news site owned by
the Symantec Corporation, which then notified Guess. Within hours, the
company fixed the site.

Knowing which location register (cell-phone networks use, essentially,
remote procedure call with callbacks between "location registers" to
authorize outbound calls, correctly route inbound calls, etc.) a phone is
currently active on, or has recently been active on, is *not* the same as
knowing where a phone is with GPS precision, nor even the same as knowing
which cell site a phone is currently speaking to.  Logs of transitions
between LRs ("roaming", even if that hardly exists from most customers'

Microsoft Word documents are notorious for containing private

Last week, Alastair Campbell, Blair's Director of Communications and
Strategy, was in the hot seat in British Parliament hearings
explaining what roles four of his employees played in the creation of
a plagiarized dossier on Iraq which the UK government published in
February 2003.  The names of these four employees were found hidden
inside of a Microsoft Word file of the Iraq dossier which was posted
on the 10 Downing Street Web site for use by the press.  The "dodgy
dossier" as it became known in the British press raised serious
questions about the quality of British intelligence before the second
Iraq war.

I don't know exactly what it is about PayPal (as compared with any

to a non-PayPal site.

The newest variant is a bit more insidious than the previous ones I've

site, but appears to immediately re-direct you to a valid PayPal page.
You have to either be looking in the page source for the non-PayPal

Subject: Re: Phantom voting in Israeli Knesset (Ravin, RISKS 22.76)

It is worth noting that the computerized voting system used by the
Israeli Knesset has, as far as I know, no security whatsoever.  It
consists solely of a station of buttons at each Member of Knesset's
(MK's) seat for him/her to use to register his/her vote.  No
authentication is required for casting a vote.  All an MK has to do to
cast someone else's vote is to lean over and push the desired button
at the other MK's station.

In contrast, the electronic voting stations in the US House of
Representatives require a "Vote-ID" card to be inserted before a
Congressman can vote.  Furthermore, there are many fewer stations than
seats (Congressman line up to vote at the stations), so I suspect that
the stations all have cameras trained on them throughout each vote,
such that if there is suspicion of wrong-doing after a vote, it is
straightforward to replay the video to find out who voted twice.

The US Senate has no electronic voting equipment -- counted votes are
conducted by roll-call or paper ballot.

This is surely far from the first time that MK's have voted for each
other.  In fact, I find myself wondering not how this could be allowed
to happen, but rather why a fuss is being made about this particular
instance of it.  If the Knesset really wanted to prevent it, they
could do so, so it seems to me that they haven't seen it as a problem.
Perhaps the culture within Israel's government is changing, such that
what was previously acceptable behavior is becoming unacceptable.

Subject: Abridged info on RISKS (comp.risks)

 The RISKS Forum is a MODERATED digest.  Its Usenet equivalent is comp.risks.
=> SUBSCRIPTIONS: PLEASE read RISKS as a newsgroup (comp.risks or equivalent)
 if possible and convenient for you.  Alternatively, via majordomo,
 send e-mail requests to <risks-request@csl.sri.com> with one-line body
   subscribe [OR unsubscribe]
 which requires your ANSWERing confirmation to majordomo@CSL.sri.com .
 If Majordomo balks when you send your accept, please forward to risks.
 [If E-mail address differs from FROM:  subscribe "other-address <x@y>" ;
 this requires PGN's intervention -- but hinders spamming subscriptions, etc.]
 Lower-case only in address may get around a confirmation match glitch.
   INFO     [for unabridged version of RISKS information]
 There seems to be an occasional glitch in the confirmation process, in which
 case send mail to RISKS with a suitable SUBJECT and we'll do it manually.
   .UK users should contact <Lindsay.Marshall@newcastle.ac.uk>.
=> SPAM challenge-responses will not be honored.  Instead, use an alternative 
 address from which you NEVER send mail!
=> The INFO file (submissions, default disclaimers, archive sites,
 copyright policy, PRIVACY digests, etc.) is also obtainable from
 http://www.CSL.sri.com/risksinfo.html  ftp://www.CSL.sri.com/pub/risks.info
 The full info file will appear now and then in future issues.  *** All
 contributors are assumed to have read the full info file for guidelines. ***
