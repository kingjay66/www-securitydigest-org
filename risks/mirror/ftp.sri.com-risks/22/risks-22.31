Subject: E-ZPass Users in New Jersey Will Get Replacement Devices

New Jersey's E-ZPass windshield transponders are wearing out sooner than
expected, resulting in hundreds of thousands of mistaken violation notices
being issued.  Similar problems with the manufacturer, Mark IV Industries,
have arisen in 14 states (not all of which are E-ZPass customers).  Over
about 900,000 users out of six million will be getting free replacements.

Subject: The high risk of low security: element 118

Recently a prominent physicist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
was fired, and the reported detection of element 118 was retracted.
Everyone concerned agrees that essential data in a computer file had been
faked, forged, or fudged.

  [What to name the would-be new element?  
  Phonium?  Phakium?  Phorgium?  Phudgium?  PGN]

The fired physicist denies doing the dirty work.  According to *The New York
Times, Science section, 15 Oct 2002: ``He says he is as perplexed as anyone.
His account on the laboratory computer system was used by everyone in his
group, he says, and his password was an open secret.''

The outside key-code on my building has five buttons but ten digits -- two

Government's secret Celldar project will allow surveillance of anyone, at
any time and anywhere there is a phone signal

Jason Burke and Peter Warren, 13 Oct 2002, *The Observer*

Secret radar technology research that will allow the biggest-ever extension
of 'Big Brother'-style surveillance in the UK is being funded by the
Government.  The radical new system, which has outraged civil liberties
groups, uses mobile phone masts to allow security authorities to watch
vehicles and individuals 'in real time' almost anywhere in Britain.  The
technology 'sees' the shapes made when radio waves emitted by mobile phone
masts meet an obstruction. Signals bounced back by immobile objects, such as
walls or trees, are filtered out by the receiver. This allows anything
moving, such as cars or people, to be tracked. Previously, radar needed
massive fixed equipment to work and transmissions from mobile phone masts
were thought too weak to be useful.  ...

Subject: UCSD bans WinNT/2K -- will it do any good?

Seen in *Security Wire Digest* ... seems to me it's trading the devil you
know for the devil you ... know.  Is WinXP really any more secure than
WinNT/2K?  Now if they banned the use of Outlook, that might be a step
forward...

BTW, students have to pay for a copy of WinXP.  Maybe this is a fundraising
effort by Microsoft... put out products that are so vulnerable that users
have to spend more money to buy a less vulnerable version.  "I'm sorry
ma'am, but the wheels frequently fall off the 1998 model cars.  We have no
intention of fixing the problem.  Would you like to buy a 2002 model for
$20,000?  By the way, you'll also need to build a new garage on your house
to park it in, and a new driver's license, because the old ones aren't
compatible."

*UNIVERSITY BANS WINDOWS NT/2000
Citing security reasons, the University of California at Santa Barbara
(UCSB) has banned the use of Microsoft Windows NT/2000 on its residential
network, ResNet. In a posting on the ResNet site, UCSB officials blame the
OSes for "hundreds of major problems on UCSB's residential network during
the 2001-2 academic year," including exploited vulnerabilities,
denial-of-service attacks, port scanning, and infections by Code Red and
Nimda. UCSB recommends that ResNet users switch to Windows XP Home.

Subject: Microsoft Skins a Knee on the Astroturf

A grass-roots campaign orchestrated by a PR department is commonly called
"astroturf." What shall we call Microsoft's embarrassing sally at Apple's
successful "Switchers" campaign?  Let's consider "paid testimonial."  ...

No one expects Apple's ads to swing much market share, but perhaps Microsoft
was feeling their sting.  On Monday the company posted a Web page,
"Confessions of a Mac to PC convert," supposedly written by a young woman
who had switched from Apple to Windows XP. Her name was not given.  Her
picture, as Slashdot posters quickly discovered, was a stock image available
for purchase from Getty's Photodisc.  (Why the agency did not use an image
from the competing Corbis service, owned by Bill Gates, is another mystery.)

Subject: How we run elections in the UK

I have been following, with a mixture of amusement and alarm, the
correspondence about elections ever since Florida.

In the UK, we have a separate ballot paper for each issue at stake (perhaps
we're not as democratic as the USA - there is usually just one at a time),
and we use a manual count.  The counters are usually "volunteered" from the
class of people most likely to be able to count large numbers of pieces of
paper quickly and accurately - bank cashiers.

The count proceeds in two stages: separating the votes between the various
candidates, and then counting the individual piles, grouping them by elastic
band into packets of 500 or 100.  Dubious cases are taken out and argued
over separately. The counts are scrutinised by representatives of the
various political parties and others involved.  A partial recount can be
done very quickly by counting the number of packets in each candidate's pile
(e.g. a winning count of 25,000 votes is counted by counting the 50 packets
of 500 votes each), while a full recount involves recounting the number of
votes in each packet (not a very long job, but necessary only if the result
is close).  Any candidate can claim a recount, either if there is doubt
about who has won, or if there is doubt about whether a candidate has
obtained enough votes to keep his deposit.

Every general election, there is an informal competition between the various
constituencies to see which can declare their result first (the declaration
including a statement of the numbers of votes for each candidate, hence
requiring a complete count).  With an electorate averaging about 80,000 per
constituency, the time to first declaration is usually just over one hour
after the ballot closes.

At a general election, the result is usually clear enough for the loser at
national level to concede victory before the following dawn, and the removal
trucks (should they be required) move into Downing Street the day after the
election (in the UK, the result is, usually, effective immediately).

The system is low-tech, but quick, reasonably efficient, recountable, and
verifiable.

However, there are moves afoot to introduce electronic voting in the UK, and
it was reported last week that Dr. Rebecca Mercuri visited the UK last week
to voice her concerns about some of the proposed voting methods.  I
sincerely hope that the UK authorities will respect her knowledge and listen
to her concerns.

Is Microsoft's End User License Agreement for Windows 2000 Service

as being meant primarily to ask for permission to execute certain
tasks that the user is about to initiate: the tasks that constitute

doesn't spell out that the permission being asked for is limited to
an immediate response to a specific user request.

Well, it does say "recording electrodes", which sounds to me like there's no
output voltage.  Unless there's a need to send a small voltage pulse out to
cause a response for certain things being recorded, of course.

However, if it did control voltages, and those voltages had a range high
enough to cause damage to the patient, you are correct there's a big risk
here.  Whether that's from MS having an OS that might update itself during
surgery, or a hospital dumb enough to put something that could be harmful to
the patient on the Internet where MS updates are only one of a number of bad
things that can happen to it, I'm not sure.

Now consider that the phone menus are functions ....

I finally caught up with a fascinating analysis of the history of risk

%T   "Hacking Exposed: Network Security Secrets and Solutions, 3rd Ed"

Yes, I know that this book has the most sales for any security work,
ever.  And, for the life of me, I still can't figure out why.

Part one looks at gathering data for an attack.  Chapter one discusses
company information that is generally available.  However, while it
may alert some to the fact that a lot of information can be obtained
about them, most of the material deals with facts that you either want
to make available, or that you must make available.  Some suggested
countermeasures are useful, while others strain the topic, such as the
protection against domain hijacking.  Scanning for weaknesses and
loopholes, mostly with individual tools, in this edition, is the topic
of chapter two.  Enumeration, or finding weak user accounts and
unprotected system resources (mostly on Windows 2000) is covered in
chapter three.

Part two looks at details of specific systems.  Chapter four touches
on Windows 9x.  NT gets a fair amount of detail in chapter five, but
such vital and standard topics as disabling the Administrator account
and setting up auditing are barely mentioned.  Windows 2000 now has
its own chapter: six.  Some common NetWare attacks are listed in
chapter seven.  UNIX has the most extensive coverage, in chapter
eight, but it is hardly comprehensive.

Part three deals with network weaknesses.  Most of chapter nine
discusses war-dialling and dial-up, but there is a brief mention of
Virtual Private Networks (VPN).  Some device weaknesses (vendor
specific bugs, that is) are listed in chapter ten.  (There is also a
very brief mention of wardriving and detecting wireless networks.) 
Firewalls, in chapter eleven, are primarily addressed in terms of
scanning to (for identification) or through.  Chapter twelve describes
a few denial of service attacks.  (Something has been lost in the
update: a discussion of IP fragmentation attacks refers to "earlier"
material on teardrop that no longer appears in the book.)

Part four looks at software.  Chapter thirteen deals with remote
access software in fair detail.  Hijacking and backdoors are discussed
in chapter fourteen.  Miscellaneous Web site bugs are reviewed in
chapter fifteen.  Chapter sixteen is a confusing amalgam of ActiveX
design flaws, Internet Explorer implementation bugs, and random
discussions of malware.

The original preface (which no longer appears in the work) stated that the
book was intended for system administrators, but it did, and still does,
read more like a cookbook for security breaking.  The authors defend
themselves against this charge in advance, and certainly "keep quiet" versus
"let it all hang out" is a constant debate in security circles.  However,
the attack descriptions are far more detailed than the countermeasures
sections, and many attacks are presented without any specific protections
being mentioned.  There are a number of points in the book that can be
helpful in identifying specific security weaknesses.  However, the book
can't be comprehensive in that regard, and what it fails to do is give an
overall concept of, or framework for, security on an ongoing basis.  The
examples given are frightening and stimulating, but the authors present them
as the entire picture.  In fact, even the picture as presented is not
entire.  A number of descriptions given in the book either do not mention,
or gloss over, the fact that, for example, sniffers must be placed on a
local, promiscuous, network, and session hijacking requires that the
attackers somehow get "between" two systems.

On the other hand, the book is quite readable and can give you some tips.
And, I wouldn't mind seeing a few sysadmins a little more scared than they
are at the moment.  As long as they don't think that this is *all* you need
to do.

%T   "Have You Locked the Castle Gate: Home and Small Business
      Security"

Chapter one is entitled "Assessing Risk."  It deals with the basic concepts,
but in a somewhat confused manner, and sometimes stresses or sensationalizes
minor points.  A grab bag of security concepts drifts into Windows specifics
in chapter two.  The author has said that he will be concentrating on
Windows, since it is the most widely used system for home computers, but the
material tells only *how* to, for example, set up groups, and not what
groups are used for in terms of security.  Chapter three is more of the
same: more miscellany, and more Windows.  The discussion of servers, in
chapter four, is almost entirely devoted to Windows, and is weak on security
concepts and technologies such as firewalls.  There is a set of vague ideas
about the Internet in chapter five.  Chapter six, on email security, has
some good suggestions, but a number of gaps.  Web security is a questionable
checklist of browser settings, almost entirely for Internet Explorer, in
chapter seven.  "Defending Against Hackers," in chapter eight, sounds like
it should be important, but it is hard to find any point.  Chapter nine, on
viruses, starts with a surprisingly good set of definitions (recognizably
from "Robert Slade's Guide to Computer Viruses") but quickly deteriorates
into errors (the Internet Worm was *not* an accident), and poor suggestions
(it does not make an awful lot of sense to talk about "boot disks" for
scanning Windows systems without getting into a lot of detail).

I am all in favour of having a relatively simple and straightforward guide
to security for home and small business users.  But Jeff Crume already did
"Inside Internet Security" (cf. BKININSC.RVW), and did a much better job.

 this requires PGN's intervention -- but hinders spamming subscriptions, etc.]
 Lower-case only in address may get around a confirmation match glitch.
   INFO     [for unabridged version of RISKS information]
 There seems to be an occasional glitch in the confirmation process, in which
 case send mail to RISKS with a suitable SUBJECT and we'll do it manually.
   .MIL users should contact <risks-request@pica.army.mil> (Dennis Rears).
