Subject: NSW forced to hand count poll result

  "Computer problems have forced the New South Wales electoral office to
  start manually counting nearly 4 million upper house ballot papers.  NSW
  Electoral Commissioner John Wasson says it will be a mammoth task to have
  all the votes counted and preferences allocated before the declaration of
  the poll at the end of the month.  It is hoped the computer glitches will
  be fixed later this week, but Mr Wasson says he can not afford to delay
  the count any longer.  [...]
  <http://www.abc.net.au/news/justin/nat/newsnat-14apr2003-43.htm>

My (slightly informed) guess is that the NSW Electoral Office acquired and
made changes to the Australian Electoral Commission's election management
software. The changes are to allow for the new NSW Upper House voting system
and they have not been a success. This is probably due to inadequate testing
as the changes to the Electoral Act were made quite some time ago.

To give them some credit, it's quite a challenge to simulate an election
with 4 million voters in a realistic way. My experience with testing the AEC
software in the pre-outsourced mid-1990s was that the stresses imposed by a
real election were always well in excess of anything that could be simulated
-- and some elections were conducted with changes to the counting
requirements made in the last few months before the election...

I'll bet he's hoping the software starts working though. Mind you, it's hard
to be all that confident in the results -- even leaving aside that the
requirement for random sampling of papers in NSW upper house elections
(unlike the Senate) makes exact reproduction of results problematic.

The return of the writs is required by 29 Apr 2003 IIRC.

Subject: Nevada hospital system hack traced to Russia

The security of a small Nevada hospital's computer system was breached by a
hacker who has been traced back to Russia.  The hacker routed the attack
through the al-Jazeera Web site to make it look as if the attack came from
the Middle East.  The hacker may have accessed employees' social security
numbers and bank account information.  A Trojan horse program embedded in a
game some employees had downloaded allowed the attackers access. The
hospital's payroll system has been removed from the network and employees
have been instructed never to install software or sign on to streaming
Internet services.

Subject: Automated denial-of-service attack using the U.S. Post Office

In December 2002, the notorious "spam king" Alan Ralsky gave an interview.
Aside from his usual comments that antagonized spam-hating e-mail users, he
mentioned his new home in West Bloomfield, Michigan.  The interview was
posted on Slashdot, and some enterprising reader found his address in some
database.  Egging each other on, the Slashdot readership subscribed him to
thousands of catalogs, mailing lists, information requests, etc.  The
results were devastating: within weeks he was getting hundreds of pounds of
junk mail per day and was unable to find his real mail amongst the deluge.

Ironic, definitely.  But more interesting is the related paper by security
researchers Simon Byers, Avi Rubin and Dave Kormann, who have demonstrated
how to automate this attack.

Subject: Risks posed by online systems for college and graduate admissions

Late last year, I sent out a number of applications to masters programs in
computer science. Where possible, I submitted my applications by way of
online application systems, and had my recommendation providers submit their
recommendations online. (In fact, a number of programs charge an increased
application fee to applicants who choose to submit their applications on
paper rather than using the online system; paper seems to be deprecated.) I
did not realize that in doing this I was exposing myself to a significant
computer-related risk, as illustrated by my experience with the University
of Virginia.

I applied online to Virginia's MS program in computer science, and had my
recommendations provided online. When I had yet to hear an admissions
decision by early April, I called the department to find out when I could
expect to know. I was informed that my application had not been evaluated
because the paper file on which the admissions committee was basing its
decisions seemed to be incomplete; it was missing one of the three required
recommendations.

I was very confused by this, as I'd been using the online application system
to track and confirm the successful arrival of all of my application
materials. To my knowledge, everything was in order, and had been for quite
some time. The recommendation thought to be missing had been submitted in
mid-November. I pointed this out, and the "missing" recommendation was
promptly found and added to the paper file, but by then the damage was
done. Notices were already out to accepted applicants; the best that could
be done for me was placement on the waitlist.

What are the risks here? Generating paper applications from online may
introduce errors, errors that will not be visible to the applicant. If these
paper files are treated as authoritative -- if the online application is not
consulted in the case of seeming incompleteness or inconsistency --
applications may be passed over for no good reason at all.

Subject: Risks of *not* being lost

Seems many of the ""embedded"" media procured Thuraya brand sat/cell phones
before departing. These are controlled by a ground station in Abu Dhabi, and
to optimize performance, the phone locates itself with an on-board GPS and
reports back that position to the ground station.

Ooops, current exact location is one thing the US does NOT want the Other
Guys to know. While you could in theory use triangulation or other schemes
to locate any EM emitter, including a phone, making it easy for Them is
hardly ever a good idea. The military has confiscated the phones.

The competitor, Iridium, may well also do this too, but allegedly the GPS
reporting can be turned off [how? hardware or ....software?]  and in any
case, that ground station is in the US. Given that Iridium is running at all
only because Uncle Sam bought a govt-wide license, one could hope that
someone has considered the integrity of that aspect beforehand.

Note that the FBI is mandating tracking of all domestic cell phones as well,
with the already past due-date being slipped back time and again. Security
at our myriad providers can not help but be worse than at that single
Iridium ground station.

And in both TV and real life, cops and FBI agents carry cell phones.  In the
future will oh, Willy Sutton | John Brown | Jonathan Pollard | Paul Reubens
be able to track the FBI agents tracking them?

Subject: "Quick Deposit" systems

I wandered into my branch of Barclays Bank in Enfield, UK, this 
afternoon in order to deposit a couple of cheques. For quite a while, 
Barclays has had a "Quick Deposit" machine - obviously old tech, green 
text on a character-mapped screen, no buttons; you just insert your 
envelope with the cheques and a deposit slip, and it prints a receipt.

Recently, an additional machine of a newer design has been installed. 
This one looks much more like a cashpoint - number keypad, buttons on 
the side of the screen - and has card slots, cheque slots, and all sorts 
of attachments. It's far harder to use and takes much more time than the 
original. But its UI flaws are for another mailing list.

This afternoon I walked up to it, and noticed that the screen said 
"NTDetect 4.00". I watched in amazement as the NT 4 boot sequence 
proceeded, via the "Press Space for Last Known Good menu" 
(unfortunately, pressing of keys only revealed that none were mapped to 
Space), the Blue Screen of Bootup (NT4 SP6, 128MB RAM), and the splash 
screen ("with Internet Explorer"), to an NT 4 desktop, complete with 
"Outlook Express" icon!

Some startup scripts ran, which showed me that I was logged in as 
Administrator, and then some sort of debugging application popped up. 
Because it left me in a text input window in this debugging app, I was 
able to work out the key mappings of the built-in keypad. The number 
keys produced numbers, Cancel was Backspace and Enter was return. The 
other keypad keys seemed to have little effect.

Pressing the keys on the side of the monitor seemed to trigger 
something, because several bits of attached machinery began whirring. 
Shame it's not a cashpoint, I thought. I didn't try feeding bits of 
paper into it. Other sundry error dialogs and DOS boxes gave me some 
idea of the filesystem layout, running software and so on.

After a couple of minutes, the scripts must have finished, because the 
desktop disappeared to be replaced with "This Terminal is not in use" in 
Barclays livery.

The RISKS are many:

- Using a general-purpose OS for an embedded application
- Having the input and output devices connected before the embedded app
   is ready to accept input
- Using an Administrator account to run your app
- Mapping keys to their obvious equivalents (Return is dangerous;
   mapping "Enter" to e.g. "G" would have been safer)
- Keeping debugging applications installed on production machines, and
   having them automatically invoked

  A disabled mother of three has been barred from receiving tax credits

The fact that obvious input validation problems, and properly specifying the

Subject: New comprehensive Federal rules on privacy of medical information

The article in the 12 Apr 2003 *San Jose Mercury News*
http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/news/5614657.htm 
is an easy to read summary of the new Federal rules on privacy of medical
information privacy, just being put into effect.  There is a very large body
of literature on the general subject and on the development of the
standards, and the set of rules itself is a huge body of text.  This reader
sees lots of good intentions, but also lots of problems, such as how medical
and computer personnel -- and citizens, can understand the complex rules to
determine what is allowed and what is not, how to help a client know whether
exercising an option is a good idea or not, whether implementation of the
rules will be an intolerable burden on health care practice, and how the
integrity of a given implementation can be verified and preserved.  On the
last point, there seems to be no provision in the law for certification;
rather it seems that it will be up to the courts to decide if the rules were
violated in a particular case.  This development deserves attention.

Subject: Re: POW Social Security numbers revealed (Hirose, RISK-22.67)

It is often suggested that disclosure of SSN's is a great risk. In the
current climate, where SSN's are used to *authenticate* an individual ("tell
us your SSN so we know it is you") that certainly is true.

However, I suggest an alternate approach to solving the problem of identity
theft. SSN's are hopelessly easy to obtain; attempting to curtail the
broadcast of these numbers (e.g. hoping the Iraqi state television will
control the release) is futile. Instead, I suggest that the US Government
*prohibit* the use of SSN's as authenticators. If all of the US
organizations that currently authenticate with SSN's were forced to use
something else (anything else) the state of the identity theft crisis would
improve drastically.

The "*anything* else" part is important to this proposal. It is tempting to
propose something prescriptive, specifying how organizations should
authenticate people. However, I suspect that such prescriptions would make
the law founder on impracticality, as organizations find high quality
authentication difficult to implement for one reason or anther.

In contrast, simply forcing organizations to choose something else at least
has the scattershot effect that they are unlikely to choose all the same
attributes, making wholesale identity theft much more difficult.

Just me proposing this idea here and getting a few folks to agree that it
would be beneficial is fun & all :-) but won't actually change anything.
More constructive would be if those who do agree with the idea, and have
more influence in the financial regulation space than I do, would take up
the idea and start spreading it around.

Assuming that the failure of one of the postulates results in the failure
of the premise, we can put this one to bed.

Since when is a NAT box "intended to conceal the actual origin of IP
traffic"?  The intended purpose of NAT and the use it is put to in every
case I am aware of is to allow persons with a single IP Address to have more
than one host on their network that can all access the INTERNET and I am
certain that is the reason LinkSYS gives for selling the products that have
NAT built in.  On top of that, NAT hides nothing.  You still need at least
one valid routable IP address and that address is traceable to a fixed
location and person responsible.

If the purpose of NAT were to "conceal the actual origin of IP traffic",
what then of DHCP?

The RISK here is that we start chasing after demons that don't exist while
missing the ones that really do.

  "Train signals interfering with the frequency of the underground

I can't help but wonder what kind of signaling system was being used.  This
seems to be an ancient analog system that uses the frequency as part of the
message rather than a digital signal that has some independence from the
path and would have some resilience. Turning a signal red in the absence of
other information is understandable but why is the signal so fragile?

I might not have commented were it not for the name "Millennium" train which
would indicate a design that reflects today's understanding of

pristine frequencies because that's the only technique we knew a century
ago.

In RISKS-22.68, I gave some figures from [1, Figure 1.1, p1-2] suggesting
that the number of fratricide incidents in recent conflicts (from WW II) lay
around 1% of casualties. The figure for Desert Storm/Shield that I gave was
mistaken. The figures from FM 100-14 Figure 1.1 are:

                World War II     Korea     Vietnam     Desert Storm/Shield
                   (1942-45)      (1950-53)  (1965-72)       (1990-1991)

Friendly Fire     1%             1%         1%                5%
Enemy Actions    43%            55%        45%               20%

Paul Marks of the *New Scientist* pointed out to me that the UK National
Audit Office takes a different view. It says that "American research shows
that, historically, fratricide accounts for between ten and 15 per cent of
friendly casualties during operations." [2, paragraph 1.5]

FM 100-14 speaks simply of "losses". The UK NAO defines fratricide as
"destruction of friendly or allied forces". It is possible that these are
two different concepts. But it is also possible that people aren't counting
very precisely. It's a shame that one cannot tell from either of these
documents what the figures actually represent.

Subject: Re: Friendly Fire (Van Meter, RISKS-22.68)

Mr. Van Meter explains that the term "casualty" refers to persons "killed or
injured". This is not correct. Casualties refer to persons killed, injured,
or *missing*.

"Missing" includes anyone whose whereabouts are unknown. The soldier may have
been captured by the enemy, or they may have run away to -- possibly -- turn
up later, or they may have been killed but their remains hadn't been
identified or their remains were unidentifiable.

I agree with Mr. Van Meter that confusion over the term "casualty" has
caused much misinformation. In September 2002, on the 140th anniversary of
the American Civil War battle of Antietam (the single bloodiest day in
American history), CNN Headline News mentioned that there were 23,000 men
killed in the battle. The total casualties were just less than 23,000, 3600
of whom were killed (though many of the 1700 missing men were likely dead
and buried in unmarked graves, and many of the wounded would die sometime
later). This error is particularly ironic as Ted Turner is a Civil War buff.
