Subj:	[1001] Re: VideoCipher II

Yes... the same monthly master key is (or at least was) used for all channels.
Thus, if you can decrypt one, you can decrypt all. The VC-II uses
non-crypto means to decide whether you can watch a particular channel.
Thus, if you defeat this (by modifying the code), you can subscribe
to one channel (which makes all the crypto possible) and then receive all.

My understanding is that someone dissected the crypto chip, found a
way to reconnect a factory test lead, and was able to get intermediate
crypto products out that can be used to crack the key. This is from
a hazy memory.

Subj:	[1156] Re: Security and Masterkeys

Don't expect the master to always be the lowest cut key. It is not in many
cases, although the pins where it is the "high cut" tend to be ones
reserved for zone master/grand master distinctions. However, I've never
seen a system where the highest cut was used in more than a couple of
pin positions, so the number of keys possible, even when working from a
single lock as an information source, is not very large.

Use of different grooves in the blank is the usual mechanism to
differeniate grand masters from great grand masters. However, adding
additional grooves to a key is pretty easy if you have access to a
mill and a tool of the proper size. Making your own key from brass stock
is also not too hard if you know what you're doing, and it makes complete
hash out of all these foolish "registered blank" schemes.

I mentioned making a key out of sheet metal in a previous posting. I once
made one out of mild steel as a sort of joke for somebody; it wasn't even
a master since that was not part of the joke (his key broke off in his
lock on two different occasions and I thought I'd make one that would not
suffer from this problem).

1 - Make the password program reject dumb passwords.

2 - Run a fast password cracker against all of our systems to insure 
    the "root" hasn't given someone a dumb password.
	    
You are assuming that you and your staff will assign passwords that are
safe and memorable. My experience is that, under the pressure of
events, people will assign passwords to others that are as bad, or worse,
that those others would have picked for themselves.

Let your software do the work for you. 

Of course, you did say a "medium sized system". The problem with most
solutions that I have seen, to all Unix system administration problems,
are that they are not scalable. As systems grow, things break! Can you

  Do you have to be licensed in the town/state?  Or can you just set up shop

I have heard the argument made that forcing frequent password changes is
counterproductive--particularly in those systems where the user logs in,
learns that her/his password has expired, and has to choose a new one
IMMEDIATELY.  The supposed flaw is that the user will pick a poor password,
because there isn't enough time to think up a good one.  Similarly, those
password generator programs that impose a non-english password on the user
are said to cause passwords to be written down.

I'm not sure I subscribe to either argument, but wondered what others in

Subj:	[4318] Virus prevention

Re Kees deGroot's posting.
The DECUS library sells to anyone (membership in DECUS is free and
nobody is that concerned whether you are or are not a member.) The
software in it (multiple gigabytes of software) covers a great many
machines, and is NOT, repeat NOT, limited to boxes DEC makes. You
won't find much systems code for, say, Unisys boxes in the DECUS
library, but applications that will run on Unisys boxes certainly
abound.
   The library is run by a staff, who are DEC employees.
   It has two basic virus/trojan resistant attributes.
   First, the submitter is ALWAYS known and recorded, and everyone
who gets software from the library (for which a production fee is
charged; the cost is NOT paying for the software, but is covering part
of the cost of running a fulltime library) has that name.
   What you get is a copy of what the submitter sent in. The production
machines aren't on any nets or outside hookups; this makes them
fairly resistant to penetration by ill-doers.
   Further, there's a central office with people who answer the phone.
When covert behavior of a program is detected, here's what happens:
  1. The program is pulled from further distribution.
  2. People are notified by whatever means are available (which these
	days will include the net) about the nature of the problem and
	all specifics that are known.
  3. Efforts are made if the program was otherwise useful to reset the
	covert behavior and distribute the cleaned-up one together with
	a complete analysis of what happened.

	Source code is usually available also.
	This happened only once so far where a program had a covert
time-out. The damage to someone's reputation when he submits a program
and suffers all the adverse publicity which we can and WILL produce
is such that there's not much incentive to try putting covert behavior
into programs going into the DECUS library.
	Besides this, a good many of us use the code and look for
"funny" stuff. It's not organized so that there's 100% coverage,
and we don't want to say there is coverage even where it exists in
too strong a form; we are after all human and don't want lawsuits by
someone who says we should have tested more. But there are paths for
reporting odd behavior and reacting to it. This applies to the sig
tapes also, which are produced and distributed outside the DECUS
library as well as contributed to it. Most funny behavior that's been
reported are version or site dependencies (which can be quite hard
for an author to detect) and we try to tell what we find. 
	In all, the path from author to recipient is probably shorter
dealing with DECUS library stuff or SIG tape stuff than it is for
most commercial software, and we won't and haven't concealed any
reported covert behavior; we are best protected by publicizing any
such as quickly and widely as possible. Be sure this list will get such
reports, as well as info-vax/comp.os.vms and, if we find a worm orv
virus, virus-l. 
	We do ask that people using the code help by reporting any
odd behavior. You can call the DECUS office (508 480 3418 will get
you into the office, though you'll need probably another extension
to which you can be transferred) or me (215 354 7610) (me for
sig tape info; the DECUS office for any, by preference) or Ted
Nieland (513 427 6355) for SIG tape info also. To the extent we
watch one another's backs, we're all the safer.
	Funny behavior in this case means suspected covert behavior
by a program. If you have a systems program written, say, for VMS
V4.7 and try running it on VMS 5.3-1 symmetric multiprocessors, you
should expect it to fail in many cases. We're more interested thee
there in what succeeds. However, timeouts, odd use of privs, 
writing files or modifying files that aren't documented, and the
like are of interest.
	I understand the concerns about trojans or viruses, but these
are probably more likely in commercial software than people realize.
Your path from the submitter to you is as short dealing with the DECUS
library as it is buying direct from a commercial vendor, and shorter
than if the software passes through a store or distributor. The DECUS
record of NOT concealing any problems is also public, and that
policy will ultimately protect you further.

Subj:	[1460] Failed: attempt #1 at securing the vehicle

It would be REALLY GREAT if makers of "real" locks made drop-in replacements
for car doors, complete with reinforcing plates and good pin cylinders and a
mechanism that works such that once you turn the key a certain way the little
lever is locked toward one direction and won't move at all.  This would prevent
use of a slim-jim.  Unfortunately for the kind of car-door latch that doesn't
work when the lock is locked, it could also trap people inside the car.  Given
that one would have to explicitly lock the door from the outside with such a
rig, I think that I'd personally rather have that small risk than what, for
instance, I have now, which is a car that's frighteningly easy to break into.

I recently tore my door apart to investigate the possibility of doing this.
The cylinder has a limit stop which prevents motion much more than 60 degrees
either way from center, and this stop is somewhere underneath the stupid
press-fit front bezel, which if bent apart and then back again will probably
be rather weakened.  So for the moment I've given up on the idea of redoing it
so it could be turned 180 degrees and then the key pulled.  If someone knows of
a type of car cylinder whose limit stops are on the *back*, where I could
get at them and file them down, please holler, and I could go off to a junkyard
and find that kind of car.  Yes, even with all that glass sitting there
saying "break me", I still want to do this just for hack value.

That seems to be fairly typical of administrations.  Lock hackers can
be quite concerned about perceived weaknesses in the institution's
security systems, but the administration often prefers to act on the
principle that knowledge is bliss, rather than tackling the objectively
significant problem.  Anyway, one generally meets with the sort of
response that you reported, when trying to bring the attention of the
authorities to a real problem.  That's one of the reasons that
vigilantes come into existence.  At Rice, I sat in on SDS meetings just
to keep an eye on the radicals, and when they planned to blow up a
building on campus, some of us were ready to foil their plans by
entering through the steam tunnels; we didn't want our school destroyed.
(I heard that later the local SDS leader, Karolyn Kendrick, was wanted
"to help the authorities with their investigations", as the British
would put it, in connection with a similar attempt.)

>The cores had those convenient holes for picking the core sleeve.

Of course that's not what they were intended for; they're for a small
pin punch to push the pins out of the columns in case they're sticky.

(You can also drive out the pins, cap and all, but it spoils the spring.)

If you file the end of a 1/8" (I think it was) pin punch to a 45-degree
angle, it makes removing the caps without damage a breeze.

>The locks, by the way, had a master key cut for the deepest pin, even
>though the school didn't use it.  (Maybe the police or Best co?)

Best locks are pinned either by the factory or by a local Best rep.
It is NOT standard practice to add any levels of masterkeying for use
other than as part of the customer's masterkeying system.  It may be
that your school was indeed required to provide a master key to police
etc.  I don't think Best would dare build in a key for their own use.

>Someone let themselves into the locksmith's shop and stole the key
>machine the next year; very crude, they should have used it on 
>the premises so no one would have suspected.

There's always someone who doesn't have any sense of judgement and
steps beyond the bounds of harmless activity.  Stealing equipment is
certainly beyond the bounds.  At Rice, our lock hacking had to be
toned down because some idiot started stealing stuff through the
steam tunnels, and the administration threatened to expel anyone
found exploring the steam tunnels no matter what their intentions
were.  That pretty much ended a major hobby for several students.

One wonders why the school's official educational practices are so
stifling or boring that students find themselves turning to such
hobbies instead.

I've never heard of a technically-oriented college or university,
Best-using or not, where lock hacking didn't occur.  Too bad some
sort of locksmithing course credit isn't normally offered.

I don't know about "common locksmithing industry standards", but the 
Foley-Belsaw training course doesn't mention any such concern in their
lessons.  Almost everywhere I've ever been you could find a change key 
to convert to a master.  I think you are overestimating the 
training/concerns of most locksmiths.  Or perhaps is just that 
facilities outgrew the original "correct" design.

And who really cares about the master key shear line, any old shear 
line will work, even for keys that don't exist.  I've always had 
the best luck picking locks on a master key system.

And if you are in a position where you can request legitimate keys, 
you can often order masterkeys through the same office just by knowing 
the code (which you get by watching a janitor).

Subj:	[1470] File Encryption on a Packet System

Recently, someone asked how to put together a system to provide protection
for a computer system operation through a packet switch using some type
of "box" for encryption.  It's not that easy.  Remember how packet swtiching
works?  Each packet contains address information that directs it on its way
to a destination.  Since the packet switch expects clear text information,
the "box" must have some method of extracting the address data from the 
packet, encrypting the remainder, then restoring the address data to the
packet.  This process cannot be done once at the establishment of a comm
session - it must be done for each packet that will pass through the packet
switch.  The Government has invested a lot of money in accomplishing just
this type of operation.  I am not aware of any commercial sources of
equipment that do what you want using commercial encryption methods such as
DES.

The problem comes from using the "connectionless" networking provided by
packet switching.  IF you modify your system to one which allows "nailed
down" communication, the "connection-oriented" method, you can do just what
you mention - establish the connection in the clear, then "go secure".
You will also need some method of exchanging encryption keys and managing
them on some periodic basis.

SO, as you can see, the problem is solvable, but it isn't a simple one.
Sorry to be the bearer of less than encouraging news.

[Moderator explanatory tack-on: Biaxial refers to Medeco's offset-chisel-tip
pin design, in which the bottom edge of the pin is offset forward or back
by .025".  Thus the bottom of the keycut has to not only be at the right
height and twist, it also has to be at the correct offset along the key bit.

The Associated Locksmiths of America (ALOA) Proficiency Registration

Locksmith (CPL, I'm one elective away from Certified Master Locksmith, CML)
has sections on "Master-Keying" and "Advanced Master-Keying."  Both
of these sections and every book on master-keying repeatedly state
that no key should be alterable to a higher level.

You are correct about many improperly setup master-keying systems.  There

Subj:	[4041] Quantum Security

 from Science News, June 2, 1990

Bits of Uncertainty: Quantum Security, by I. Peterson

    The trouble with sending a secret message is that the recipient must
have a key for deciphering it.  This means the two parties must
initially either meet in person or risk sending the key by some less
secure communications channel, and that invites interception.  Inspired
by an idea first proposed nearly a decade ago, a group of researchers
has now designed and constructed a device that uses the uncertainty
principle of quantum physics to provide a safe but public means for
transmitting vital, secret information.

    The device uses extremely faint flashes of light -- only one photon
per flash -- to carry messages.  Each photon has a certain linear
polarization (whether the electric field associated with the light is
oscillating horizontally or vertically) and a certain circular
polarization (whether the electric field is rotating in a right-handed
or left-handed sense about its direction of travel).  According to the
uncertainty principle, there's no way to measure a photon's linear and
circular polarizations simultaneously.  Measuring one disturbs the
other.

    A sender can use the polarizations of individual photons to send a
sequence of signals to the receiver, randomly choosing whether to encode
a bit of information as a specific linear or circular polarization.  For
each photon detected, the receiver chooses randomly which type of
polarization to measure.  About half the polarization measurements would
match the values the sender transmitted.  By ascertaining which photons
were correctly measured, the sender and receiver could derive a code,
known only to them, which would serve as a key for encrypting and
deciphering messages.

    Because any measurement attempted by a third party would
unpredictably alter a photon's polarization, an eavesdropper couldn't
intercept the transmission without irrevocably scrambling the message
and alerting both the sender and receiver to the surreptitious
surveillance.  To check for eavesdropping, the receiver would simply
compare notes with the sender, ascertaining what the results for a
number of selected measurements should have been.  Statistical
deviations from the expected results would signal an eavesdropper's
presence.

    This so-called "quantum public key distribution system" is the first
communications system ever built to depend on the uncertainty principle
to ensure secrecy, say its inventors, Charles H. Bennett of the IBM
Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., and Gilles
Brassard of the University of Montreal.  "The system relies on the
uncertainty principle to enable its users to detect eavesdropping on the
quantum channel, even by an opponent with superior technology, and
reject the compromised transmissions."

    After playing with the idea for several years, Bennett and a
colleague constructed a working model of the system last summer.  The
device consists of tiny diode lasers for generating faint light flashes
and detectors for picking up the signals.  The entire apparatus sits
within a light-tight box about 13 inches long.  A computer program
controls the apparatus, tallies the signals sent, received and
intercepted, and displays the results.

    Because it is relatively slow and can be used only for communicating
random bits, the apparatus is best suited for transmitting cryptographic
keys.  Once the two users establish a key, they can exchange secret
messages by way of a faster, conventional communications channel.

    However, the device's present size severely limits its usefulness.
Bennett, who described his demonstration model at last week's Eurocrypt
conference in Aarhus, Denmark, now plans to build an improved device
using an optical-fiber cable for transmitting light pulses over
distances up to 500 meters.  Going to greater lengths is tricky because
the light pulses must necessarily be weak, which means they travel only
a limited distance along optical fibers before fading away.

Subj:	[1763] ATM machines , electronic transactions , Citibank

I am posting this article to inform the netters about a problem with
Citibank ATM machines and to ask for any information and suggestions.
Please bear with me.

When I received my last bank statement, I have noticed three transactions
in which $900 dollars were withdrawn from my accounts from a Citibank
ATM machine at a downtown NYC branch which I have never used. 

FACTS:
	1.  I did not do those transactions.
	2.  When they took place I was at work out of NYC.
	3.  I did not lose my bankcard or give it to anyone.
	4.  I did not write down my password or tell it to anyone.

After I received my statement I went to my branch and talked to a customer
representative.  After a couple of days I got two letters from Citibank
saying that results of their investigation (which consists only of looking
at the ATM machine records for those specific transactions) showed that
for those transactions my bankcard and my password were used therefore
they could not honor my claim.

Now my guess is that this is most probably a software problem because last 
weekend I went to the branch where money was withdrawn and there was a sign 
on the door saying that the ATM machines there were out of order. I also
learned that they have been out of order for about a week.

I am goig to take a legal action against to Citibank therefore
I would like to know if anybody is aware of a similar situation or if anyone
has any ideas on how this might have happened.  I would appreciate any 
information and suggestions that can help me to fight Citibank to recover my 
money and to explain how this event might have happened.

Subj:	[2352] re: Failed: attempt #1 at securing the vehicle

Forget it.  Just put a decent alarm system on the car, with an ignition kill
and jack-up/motion sensor (and maybe an audio discriminator in case the glass
breaks), and a nice loud siren (maybe the traditional "flashing" LED), and
park in a lighted area.

For the most part, reinforcing the locks, and making them "slim-jim" proof
is next to impossible.  There isn't a car around, that a qualified locksmith
(or car repo. man, or car thief) cant get into quickly.  And the tools are
widely available, as are the instructions for the individual cars.

Besides, you sorta want your car to be slim-jim-able so that when you lock your
keys in it, or lose the things, then a locksmith can get you in!

If you really wanna go nuts, get a 4 channel programmable voice driver from
Oregon Scientific (no # readily available...), and use the different inputs
from the alarm to trigger different voice outputs...).

My car says "ILLEGAL TOWING IN PROGRESS" when jacked up/towed, yells "I'M
BEING STOLEN" when the door/trunk/hook is being opened, yells "YOU BROKE
MY WINDOW" when the glass gets broken....the 4th one I havent used...Also,
I have a remote control (RF) to arm/disarm, have capabilities for passive
arming, and have a pager linked into the alarm that will find me within 2
miles when the alarm goes off.....

So far, it has saved me at least once.  I had a crook trying to break into
the car on campus during the summer, when not too many people would hear
the siren, and my pager went off.  I went off after the damn guy with a
baseball bat.  He didnt get in, and I didnt get any whacks in, but the cops
found him shortly (seems that they heard the siren and were on the way...).

at any rate, had he gotten in, I have purposely used multi-colored wires
wrapped in seemingly insane configurations to confuse a crook, hidden
the relays that trigger the pager/ign. cutout in a radio shack project
box labeled HIGH VOLTAGE.  CAUTION. under the dash.  So it would take
this "genius" of crime a longggggg time to start my car, and steal it.

At most he would get the radio, and being a standard Ford install, he could
have it with my compliments....

This is not necessarily correct.  It depends on the master keying algorithm
used.  I've rekeyed locks, changing them from a 2 level (1 level of MK) to
a 3 level (GMK, MK) and wound up with fewer pins in each lock.  Some would
say that with fewer pins in some of the stacks, the lock was more difficult to 
pick...

Subj:	[1659] Re: Best Locks

The reason for the low cut master is simply laziness on the part of
the locksmith, I believe.  When a lock is assembled, does not the
locksmith build up the pins in the rotating part by dropping in pieces
and then slide the assembly together?  If so, then there must be a key
in the lock to make the top of the pins level with the top of the
rotating part in order to let the system slide easily.  Similarly,
removal is done by the same method.  Put in a key, and remove the part
with the key in place.

If the Master is not the lowest key, a separate key would have to be
made for each lock assembled.  If the Master is the lowest, it may be
used for the assembly of each lock in turn.  Thus any locksmith paid
by the month will set up a Masterkey that is the lowest key in the
system.  Not good, but surely easy to work with.

[Moderator tack-on:  Not necessarily.  You don't need a key present to
*assemble* a lock at all; the plug can be inserted slightly offset and
everything will just drop into place when it's turned to locked position.
Also, any valid key will allow disassembly; you just have to retain all the
other parts in the shell with a thing referred to as a "following tool".
You can pick the rest of the parts out one by one afterward.  _H*]

Subj:	[1565] Re: Security and Masterkeys

> as the number of masters increases, so does the ease of picking the lock

Not necessarily.  You can have a sectional master section, where each pin
chamber has at the most one master pin.

Assume a 7-pin lock.  Pins 1 and 2 could be the site-wide master, pins
3 and 4 the building master, and pins 5 to 7 the floor master.  So, on
each floor, all the change keys will have pins 1 - 4 the same, and pins
5 - 7 different.  A floor master key would have cuts 1 - 4 the same as
the change keys for that floor, with cuts 5 - 7 cut to the master levels.
Each floor in the building be done similarly, with pins 1 and 2 the same
and pins 3 and 4 differing by floor.  The building master then has cuts
1 and 2 the same as all the other keys for that building, with cuts 3 to
7 cut to the master levels.  Finally, each building has pins 1 and 2
different, and the grand master key has all cuts cut to the master levels.

The one thing you *don't* want to do is put too many master pins in a
lock.  I once came across some Best padlocks that were meant to be opened
by any <company> serviceman in the state.  The locks had 2 or 3 master
pins in the first and last chambers, and chambers 2 - 6 had master pins
for *every level* !!!  The things practically fell open in my hands.
And, of course, once I had one in my posession, it was trivial to make a
control key for it so I could have gained access to any of their
buildings.  (What surprised me was that their locksmiths told them this
couldn't be done.)

>Seth, are you speaking from theory or do you have a high masterkey in 
>your posession?  I really want to know.

Both.

My home is master-keyed with Medeco Biaxial removable core locks.  The locks
are D-10 and D-11 deadbolts and Embassy cylindrical locksets.  The layout
is four level: GGMK, GMK, MK & CK.

	1) Each core has a separate combination (CK).
	2) There is a MK per side of each door (i.e., deadbolt and lockset)
	   and the MK that fits the inside cores on a door does not fit the
	   outside.  This prevents a delivery person from stealing an "exit"
	   key and using it to obtain entry.
	3) The outside cores are grouped under GMKs to provide "entry via the
	   front", "entry via the garage" or a "entry via the back" keys.
	4) All inside cores are grouped under a "fire egress" GMK so a
	   single key may be used to exit via any path.
	5) Every core opens with the Great Grand Master Key.

This system allows the change key (CK) for the front door lockset to be
left with a neighbor in case of a lockout, prevents a visitor from gaining
entry with a stolen "inside" key, and allows someone to enter to water
plants without letting them into the garage.

I set-up the master-keying system myself, including the calculations,
installation of the locks, pinning of the cores and cutting of the keys.
It turns out that only a few different keys were cut: the GGMK and several
GMKs, MKs and CKs.  No key in the system can be altered into a higher
level key and each key (including the GGMK and every GMK and MK) has
a wide range of cuts.  Each key has at least two cuts that differ by
the MACS (Maximum Adjacent Cut Separation) which varies from cut to
cut because of the fore and aft biaxial Medeco pins.

Subj:	[2263] Re: Locksmithing

Chapter 8.5 of the California "Business and Professions Code" is
the section relevant to Locksmiths. You'll have to check your
city charter for any local rules.

It is really most interested in people who work for hire to the general
public.

Some general definitions from the code
"Key duplicator" means an operator of a key duplicating machine who
merely duplicates keys for retail customers and who does not perform
an other functions of a locksmith.

"Locksmith" means a person, other than a key duplicator, who installs,
repairs, opens and modifies locks and who makes keys for locks.

Some relevant rules:
Permits.
On and after April 1, 1988, it is unlawful for any person to practice as
a locksmith without first obtaining a permit from the bureau.

Locksmiths working for hire; person exempt

(a) This chapter applies only to locksmiths working for hire.

(b) This chapter does not apply to the following persons:
 (1) Any person, or his or her agent or employee, who is the manufacturer
 of a product, other than locks and keys, and who installs, repairs, opens
 or modifies locks or who makes keys for the locks of that product as a 
 normal incident to its marketing.

 (2) Key duplicators.

 (3) Employees who are industrial or institutional locksmiths and whose
 services are provided only to an employer who does not provide locksmith
 services for hire to the public.

-------

You should be able to set yourself up as a key duplicator without any
problem.  You might stop by some key duplicating center and find someone
who will tell you how they go about ordering keys.

If you are interested in just a few blanks, I'm sure you can find a
key duplication place that will sell them to you uncut.

Another route is to take a mail correspondence locksmithing course.  
At the time I took mine, the cost was $400.  In the deal I got to keep 
a key making machine and can order locksmithing supplies (picks, blanks,
cutting machines, code books, etc) thru the mail order company.  I wouldn't 
recommend it unless you don't really care about the money. The first 
lesson was something like match like keys together in pairs.  

 From experience I know you can buy stuff and subscribe to trade journals
as a "student of locksmithing".

Re:	Recent Factoring Achievement
	(Preliminary draft; may contain typos or other inaccuracies.
	Please send corrections to rivest@theory.lcs.mit.edu)

This note is in response to the numerous inquiries I've received regarding
the recent factoring of a 155-digit number by A. Lenstra, M. Manasse, and
others.  (See the New York Times article of 6/20/1990 by G. Kolata.) 
This note attempts specifically to correct some of the misimpressions that
may arise from a reading of such popular press articles.

Using an ingenious new algorithm, Lenstra, Manasse, and others have
factored the 155-digit number known as "F9", the ninth Fermat number:
		F9 = 2^(2^9) + 1 = 2^(512) + 1 .
In binary, this number has the form
		100000....000000001
where there are 511 zeros altogether.  (F9 is a 513-bit number.)
This is a fascinating development, and the researchers involved are to be
congratulated for this accomplishment.

The algorithm used is known as the "number field sieve", or "NFS" (not
to be confused with a network protocol of the same acronym!).  The NFS
algorithm is described in the Proceedings of the 1990 ACM STOC Conference.
The NFS algorithm is based on an idea due to Pollard, as developed further by
Arjen Lenstra, Hendrik W. Lenstra, and Mark S. Manasse.

The NFS algorithm is specifically designed to factor numbers that,
like F9, have a very simple structure: they are of the form
		a^b + c 
where c is relatively small.  (For F9, we have a=2, b=512, and c=1.)
Some simple extensions of this algorithm are also possible, to handle
numbers whose binary representation has many zeros, and related kinds
of numbers (ternary, etc.)  Numbers that have such a special structure are
extremely rare and are unlikely to be encountered by chance.  That is,
the NFS algorithm does not apply to the kind of "ordinary" numbers that
arise in practical cryptography, such as using RSA.  They only apply to
numbers with "sparse" representations having few nonzero components.
(Let us call such numbers "rarefied".)

When working on a rarefied number, the NFS algorithm has an estimated
running time of the form (for an input number n):
		exp(1.56 (ln n)^1/3 (ln ln n)^2/3)			(1)
For n = F9, this evaluates to 
		4.1 x 10^15 operations,
which, at 3.15 x 10^13 operations/year for a 1 MIP/sec machine (i.e. a
MIP-year), gives a workload estimate of
		130 MIP-years,
only off by a factor of two from the actual work of 275 MIP-years. (That is,
formula (1) may be roughly too low by a factor of two.)

It is instructive to see the effect of doubling the size of the number
being dealt with.  A 1024-bit (332-digit) rarefied number requires an estimated
		1.54 x 10^21 operations
	=	4.9 x 10^7 MIP-years,
a dramatic increase in difficulty.  The NFS algorithm algorithm is not a
"polynomial-time" algorithm; the difficulty of factoring still grows
**exponentially** with a polynomial function of the length of the input.

What has this to do with RSA and cryptography?  I think there are three
basic points:
	-- This development indicates that the status of factoring is
	   still subject to further developments, and it is wise to be
	   conservative in one's choice of key-length.
	-- The NFS algorithm may yet be generalized to handle "ordinary"
	   numbers, and the potential impact of this should be considered.
	-- Factoring is still a very hard problem, despite everyone's best
	   efforts to master it.

Regarding the further extensions of NFS to handle ordinary numbers, this is
judged to be a reasonable possibility by those working on NFS, so it is 
helpful to consider what impact this may have.

It is conjectured (see the ACM STOC paper referenced above) that a successful
extension of the NFS algorithm to ordinary numbers would have a running time
of the form:
		exp(2.08 (ln n)^1/3 (ln ln n)^2/3)			(2)
This is similar to equation (1) except that the constant 1.56 is
replaced by the constant 2.08.  Note that a practical version of such
an extension does NOT yet currently exist (to the best of my
knowledge), but even granting its plausibility we arrive at an
estimate of the tie required to factor a 512-bit number of
		6.5 x 10^20 operations
	= 	2 x 10^7 MIP-years
which (in my opinion) is a substantial degree of security.  It is 
interesting to note that this work factor is actually GREATER than that
required by the ``standard'' factoring algorithms (e.g., the quadratic sieve),
which have a running time of
		exp((ln n)^1/2 (ln ln n)^1/2);
for a 512-bit number, this gives a work-factor estimate of only
		6.7 x 10^19 operations.
Indeed, the NFS algorithm (when extended) will be asymptotically superior than
the quadratic sieve algorithm, but will be slower for numbers with less 
than about 200 digits.  That is, assuming that (2) is indeed the correct
running-time estimate for any extension of NFS, then NFS will not affect the
security of any numbers of less than about 215 digits.  So any "standards"
that have been considered using 512-bit RSA moduli are not likely to be
affected by any NFS extensions.  (At most, one could imagine that the
RSA key-generation process might be extended to check that the resulting
modulus n is not a rarefied number.)

In the truly worst-case scenario, we would have that an extension of
NFS would be found that allows ordinary numbers to be factored with a
work-factor that is governed by equation (1); in this case one would
need to adjust the sizes of moduli used by RSA upwards by a factor of
less than two to more than offset the new algorithm.  A factor of two
in size affects the running time of public-key encryption (or
signature verification) by a factor of four and the running time of
private-key encryption (or signature generation) by a factor of eight.
Noting that the speed of workstations has increased by a factor of
over 100 in the last decade (indeed, such factors have been the
technological advance that made the successful implementation of NFS
possible!), such performance penalties, if necessary, seem to be
easily absorbed by expected technological advances in the speeds of
the underlying RSA implementation technologies.  That is, the NFS-like
factoring algorithms do not, even in this worst-case scenario, prevent
successful implementations of the RSA cryptosystem.

As a cryptographer, I am actually very happy with all the effort that
is being spent trying to determine the exact level of difficulty of
factoring.  Achievements such as the recent development of NFS help to
pin down the best-possible rate of growth of the difficulty of
factoring, so that users of cryptographic schemes can pick key sizes
with an increased degree of confidence that unforeseen developments
are unlikely to occur.  The best way to ensure confidence in a
cryptographic system is to have it attacked vigorously and
continuously (but unsuccessfully) by well-qualified attackers.  If,
despite their best efforts, the difficulty of cracking the system
remains intrinsically exponential, then one can have a reasonably high
degree of confidence that the system is actually secure.  This is the
process we have been seeing at work in the recent work on factoring.
The results of the attacks can be used to guide the selection of the
necessary key size for a desired level of security (with an
appropriate margin of safety built in, of course).

(As a closing note, here's a prediction: I expect that the 128-digit
``challenge RSA cipher'' published in the August 1977 issue of
Scientific American to be cracked (probably by the quadratic sieve
algorithm or a variant, not NFS) during the next 1-3 years.  This
accomplishment will require substantially more computer time than the
275 MIP-years required to factor F9.)

It sets the criteria for a system to meet each of the evaluation

AARRGGHH!!!  You would not believe how many people I have heard say this
lately, and is proof that a little information is a dangerous thing.
The "popular press" (Washington Post, New York Times,...) ran a story
saying exactly the above, so it's no wonder that people have this impression.

Now the REAL story:  the number factored was of a very special form,
and the algorithm used excelled for numbers of that form (in fact, the
algorithm was originally developed *only* for numbers of that form).
The RSA algorithm does not use numbers of this form (it uses the product
of two randomly generated large primes), and so public keys of the form
used by RSA are in NO DANGER from the new algorithm.

Here in St. Louis, getting a copy of your "criminal record" or police

restriction on any individual getting a copy; it costs $10 and I suppose
it is a nice source of extra income for the city or the department. All
you need is $10 cash or money order (no checks) and ID, like a drivers
license. You go to an office at the main downtown police station and
fill out a short request form, and hand over your ID & money. They keep
the money and give back the ID. :-) You wait 10 minutes or so. If you
have no record, all you get in return is a form with a big purple stamp
on it that says something like "NO RECORD FOUND". If you have a record,
you get some sort of printout with the data on it. (All I got back was
the stamped form, so I can't offer details on what a record-printout

I don't see how this really gains you anything.  An eavesdropper can still
get in by cutting the line and putting in a complete receiver/transmitter
station.  The legitimate receiver will never see any tapped bits because
they can all be completely regenerated by the eavesdropper's transmitter.

Under some circumstances, the eavesdropper might have to receive a complete
message and do whatever ECC is necessary to compensate for the 50% error
rate on the line before forwarding the message on, but the legitimate
receiver should never know the difference.

> To check for eavesdropping, the receiver would simply

This implies an out-of-band communication.  If you have such a thing in
the first place, why use quantum signalling?  If the comparisons are
going over the quantum link, the eavesdropper can modify them in transit
to hide his own presence.

Subj:	[1390] Re: Authentication of electronic commercial documents

The recent factorization of a 155 digit number was a remarkable feat, but
it holds less interest for RSA than meets the eye.  The number that
was factored was 2^512+1.  This number has binary representation

100000000000000000000000  ...  00000000000000000000001

which is of course rather special.  In fact, the method at present
works only for numbers of a very special form, and a much better gauge
of current factoring progress is provided by the RSA challenge number
that was published in Scientific American years ago.  This number has
"only" 129 decimal digits, but it has never been factored, in spite of
the obvious publicity that would result from this.  It is estimated
that the RSA challenge number might take 10 times as much work to
factor as the 155 digit number factored recently.

The moral of the story is that as a result of many people working on the
problem, we have seen a steady improvement in what numbers can be factored.
We are NOT yet to a point where generic 155 digit numbers can be factored,
but future advances may allow us to do so.  If it's a question of adopting
a system for which the modulus must be good for ten years, then I might be
skeptical about a 155 digit modulus.  For a 200 digit modulus, we will need
a significant new idea to be able to factor those.  We stand a far greater
risk from a total collapse of the banking system!

  Since userid maintenance and security seem to go hand-in-hand, I
thought I might be able to get some ideas on how to go about
attacking a problem we are facing here at OSU.  If you know of a
list that addresses this sort of thing, please let me know.
Userid creation and maintenance is one of our biggest headaches.
   We have an IBM 3090 on which we run VM/SP with MVS running
as a guest under it.  The MVS system is used mainly by our
administrative users.  We have only had VM a few months and are
wanting to open it up to our academic users who, for the most
part, abhor MVS and JCL.  The idea is for the VM system to be
"friendlier", not requiring password changes, etc.
   So, we are looking for ideas on how to automate the setup
and maintenance of permanent (faculty) and temporary (student)
userids on the VM system.  Right now we are managing the few
VM userids that we have set up through DIRMAINT.  However, we
do have VMSECURE setting on the shelf.
  It seems to me that DIRMAINT is rather cumbersome, and I'm
not sure how we could set up an automated process that would
create several hundred userids using DIRMAINT.  Anyone that
has dealt with this problem and would be willing to give us
some suggestions is welcome to respond.

          COMPUTER PROFESSIONALS FOR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

                           PRESS RELEASE

Embargoed for release on July 10, 1990

CPSR TO UNDERTAKE EXPANDED CIVIL LIBERTIES PROGRAM

CPSR, a national computing organization, announced today that it would
receive a two-year grant in the amount of $275,000 for its Computing and
Civil Liberties Project.  The Electronic Frontier Foundation, founded by
Mitchell Kapor and John Barlow, made the grant to expand ongoing CPSR
work on civil liberties protections for computer users.

At a press conference in Washington today, Mr. Kapor praised CPSR's
work.  "CPSR plays an important role in the computer community.  For the
last several years, it has sought to extend civil liberties protections
to new information technologies.  Now we want to help CPSR expand that
work."

Marc Rotenberg, director of the CPSR Washington Office said, "We are
obviously very happy about the grant from the EFF.  There is a lot of
work that needs to be done to ensure that our civil liberties
protections are not lost amidst policy confusion about the use of new
computer technologies."

CPSR said that it will host a series of policy round tables in
Washington, DC, during the next two years with lawmakers, computer users
including "hackers," the FBI, industry representatives, and members of
the computer security community.  Mr. Rotenberg said that the purpose of
the meetings will be to "begin a dialogue about the new uses of
electronic media and the protection of the public interest."

CPSR also plans to develop policy papers on computers and civil
liberties, to oversee the Government's handling of computer crime
investigations, and to act as an information resource for organizations
and individuals interested in civil liberties issues.

The CPSR Computing and Civil Liberties project began in 1985 after
President Reagan attempted to restrict access to government computer
systems through the creation of new classification authority.  In 1988
CPSR prepared a report on the proposed expansion of the FBI's computer
system, the National Crime Information Center.  The report found serious
threats to privacy and civil liberties.  Shortly after the report was
issued, the FBI announced that it would drop a proposed computer feature
to track the movements of people across the country who had not been
charged with any crime.

"We need to build bridges between the technical community and the policy
community," said Dr. Eric Roberts, CPSR President and a research
scientist at Digital Equipment Corporation in Palo Alto, California.
"There is simply too much misinformation about how computer networks
operate.  This could produce terribly misguided public policy."

CPSR representatives have testified several times before Congressional
committees on matters involving civil liberties and computer policy.
Last year CPSR urged a House Committee to avoid poorly conceived
computer crime laws that could criminalize a wide range of computer
activity.  "In the rush to criminalize the malicious acts of the few we
may discourage the beneficial acts of the many," warned CPSR.  A House
subcommittee recently followed CPSR's recommendations on computer crime
amendments.

Dr. Ronni Rosenberg, an expert on the role of computer scientists and
public policy, praised the new initiative.  She said, "It's clear that
there is an information gap that needs to be filled.  This an important
opportunity for computer scientists to help fill that gap."

CPSR is a national membership organization of computer professionals,
based in Palo Alto, California.  CPSR has over 2,000 members and 21
chapters across the country.  In addition to the civil liberties
project, CPSR conducts research, advises policy makers and educates the
public about computers in the workplace, computer risk and reliability,
and international security.

I carefully examied the material on making Unix more secure (Improving the 
security of your Unix System by David Curry, SRI International) in hopes 
of finding just why changing the password makes a system secure.  Curry's 
well thought out work has many good suggestions but he says about changing
passwords only the following: (page 7)

"Finally it is important to establish a policy that users must change 
their passwords from time to time, say twice a year."

He gives no reason for such a need, although all of the other problems 
he discusses are couched in terms of speed of cracking and methods of
penetration.

He (correctly) points out that users should never write down their 
passwords, should not use easy to guess words, and the like, but somehow 
feels that a user who has a good password, who never allows him/herself 
to be observed logging in, who sees no history of problems, should 
nevertheless change the password fairly often.

Why twice a year?  Why not twice a day?  I think it would be better
to have a good password that you do not have to write down because 
you know it (from long and careful use) than to have a password 
that you write down because you easily forget it, or to have a
password that is easy to crack because you do not want to write it 
down.

I know some people, who change their password like:
blahmmyy
blah = 4 character unique password
mm   = month
yy   = year

( or blmmyyyy, yymmblah, ........)

I think it's better, if they changed the password sometimes to
a "really new" password. Password lifetime must be long. A user
should have a chance to use an old password again, if she/he thinks
that it is not known to other people.

If the expiring period is short an you cannot use the same password
again, people will write their password on a piece of paper....
This is the real problem.

Well I am not in an environment which requires dealing with academic freedom,
but it would seem simply a matter of offering the alternative of signing a
form in which they agree to financial liability to any damage to the computer
system (including time and effort to repair) due to break-ins over their
account.

By the way DEC says they have fixed this problem (with a password history
file consulted by the Set Password command) in VMS V5.4.  For those who
use Unix, presumably the answer is to write your own modifications to Unix
following that model.

As a security practice, I would say you should *never* tolerate people
changing their password back to the same thing.  If you think keeping a
password for a long period of time is permissible, then change your
permissible password lifetime parameter.  To set a short lifetime and
then permit people getting around it (look for two successive password
changes in the pre-V5.4 VMS audit alarms), just sends the message that
system administrators are not serious about the rules they lay down.
It is better to change the rules.

> I have heard the argument made that forcing frequent password changes is
> counterproductive

I agree with the counterproductive argument.  I'm running a Unix box which
allows the user to reset their own passwords.  If I were more sensitive, this
would be restricted to system administrator use.  I've used two methods of
password generation:
	1) alternating series of consonants and vowels.  This produces only
	   marginally pronouncable passwords, but served its purposes.  Most
	   users made written copies which is frowned upon as a whole.
	2) an english word of 3-4 characters in length, a digit(0-9), and
	   another English word of 4-3 characters in length.  My Unix box
	   only allows 8 character max passwords and this satifies it.  I
	   choose the words randomly the the set of 3-4 character words in
	   my spelling checker dictionaly (/usr/dict/words).  I wrote a
	   program that generated about 200 of them (40 users on my box)
	   and I pick the topmost from the list, assign it and delete the
	   line from the file (highly restricted access to the file, BTW).

   Particularly with naive users, you have to *stress* that these passwords
are priviledged bits of information as they should not be distributed or
shared in any way.  I can't hold them responsible for security flaws if they
don't know the rules...

From: retants@rodan.acs.syr.edu

Just to pass along my experience with the password generators, we had
a lot of people writing things down.  the ones that didn't would spend 
literally hours flipping through the password generator until it came
up with something vaguely english (example being SUNNDUG...not a real
world, but something easy to remember).  THis was a waste of time in
general, but which is worse...writing down passwords or spending an 
hour finding one that can be remembered.

one suggestion made was that each time a person changed thier password,
they were given a randomized number for the space they had to put a
numeral into.  example: place a number as the 6 character of a password.
then the person could make up a password, and the system would check
to make sure that 1) there was a number in the 6th position, and 2) it
was not the same number as the position number.  Passwords would look
like DOGHO1USE which is easy to remember as a word that you add your
number to, and a bit harder to break.

any comments on that one?

Sorry if this is too elementary for the group, but I'm at sea.  I've

It's sheetmetal cage, open only on front.  You bolt or glue it to a

and there you are.  Thief can't walk away with the whole thing, and
can't open cover to steal cards.  With time, tools, knowledge, and

raises the threshhold.

Actually, both of the above posters are (in)correct.  The number
factored was of the form 10000...00001 (binary).  Such numbers are
used by RSA only by coincidence, that is to say very rarely.

Rivest further conjectured that that and other developments in
factoring would lead to the breaking of some short-key RSA within a
couple years, I believe (this is from memory, I forget the numbers).
He also said they were recommending longer keys for paranoids...er...

Subj:	[6573] ITSEC

           Observations and Comments on the ITSEC

The  ITSEC,  Information  Technology   Security   Evaluation
Criteria,  represents  the  harmonization of the  evaluation
criteria  work  done  by the UK, Germany,  France,  and  the
Netherlands.  The work is in part a response  to the Trusted
Computer Security  Evaluation Criteria of the  US Department
of Defense, in  part  an attempt to  update that  work.  For
example,  the use of the  term "Information Technololgy"  in
place of computer recognizes that the issue  is  now broader
than  it  was when the  TCSEC was  written.  It  is  also  a
response  to a concern on the part of these governments that
the TCSEC was part of a  DoD plot to exclude their  products
from the  US  market,  a  concern aggravated  by  the  DoD's
refusal, on national security  grounds,  to evaluate foreign
built  products.  (I  have never  been  certain whether  the
Europeans  really  believed in this  conspiracy,  or  simply
asserted it to get  funding for  what  they  intended to  do
anyway.)

The ITSEC describes language and criteria to  be used in the
evaluation  of security features,  functions, and properties
of computer products.  It is  independent  of  any  program,
commitment, or intent to do such evaluations.

The  use of the English language is excellent.  The  text is
clear, precise,  and  well ordered.  With  a few  exceptions
English language words retain their normal  meaning.  (There
do  not appear  to  be  any secret code  words here; trusted
means trusted, and secure  means  secure  (rather  than  the
reliable  enforcement  of  the  author's  favorite  policy).
Likewise  there  are  no  reserved  words;  classified means
classified, not CLASSIFIED.)

It would be naive  to believe  that there are no politics or
arguments  reflected  in  a  document  that  represents  the
"harmonisation"  of  the  efforts  of  four  nation  states.
However,  the ones here are sufficiently subtle as to escape
the notice of  this  practiced  observer.  The  document  is
almost totally free of rhetoric.

Important  and  useful  distinctions are  drawn, for example
between product (that  which a  vendor  offers),  system  (a
product   instance  which  someone  uses),  and   target  of
evaluation  (TOE) (that  which is  offered or  sponsored for
evaluation).  Also,  between  assurance,   correctness,  and
effectiveness.

In drawing the  distinction between  product and system, the
document acknowledges  Courtney's  first law,  i.e. "Nothing
useful can be said about  the  security  of a product/system
except  in  the  context of  a  particular  application  and
environment."  (Courtney was never able to  get  the authors
of the TCSEC to acknowledge the distinction.)  It notes that
a principal difference between  products and systems is what
is known  about their  environments (and applications); that
one may only assume  about products  what one can know about
systems.   Having said that, the authors argue that for sake
of consistency,  the same evaluation criteria should be used
for both.

Perhaps the most important distinction that the ITSEC offers
is  that  between functionality and assurance.  Indeed, they
employ separate scales for the evaluation of these.  This is
a concession  to those of  us who have complained  about the
lumping  of these in the  TCSEC.  This  results  in  a  more
granular  set  of criteria which permits a fairer comparison
of products.  It does so at the  expense  of a larger number
of points on  the  scale.  On  the other  hand, it does away
with the need for the infamous digraph.

As  in the TCSEC, assurance levels are based upon  the rigor
of the applicable and applied methodology, rather than  upon
the requirements  of  the application  and environment.  The
descriptions of the levels appears  to be  simpler and  more
granular  than  those in  the TCSEC.  However,  the  highest
defined level, E6, does not  seem to  be as rigorous as that
required for A1.  Nonetheless,  the scale is open at the top
end;  more rigorous methods could be specified as  required.
There  is  something to be  said for  resticting  oneself to
methods that are employed in  the  real  world, rather  than
arguing  for arbitrary rigor that has  not  ever before been
employed.

Another  important  distinction  that  the  ITSEC  draws  is
between the Corporate (institutional?)  Security  Policy and
the System Security Policy.  It is well  known that the both
the British and the Germans feel that the application of the
DoD  Mandatory  Policy  results  in  a tendency for  data to
migrate  toward   the  highest  classification.  They   were
anxious  to have  criteria  that  were  independent of  this
policy.

Identification is lumped with Authentication  and is applied
only   to  users.  No   consideration  is   given   to   the
identification  of  objects  or   other   subjects  such  as
processes.

Likewise the term  "attributes"  is  used  for  both  object
sensitivity labels  and  user  credentials.  While  this  is
likely to be confusing to someone that does not already know
what  is  intended,   it   is  still   better   that   using
"classification" for both objects and subjects.

Because  the  ITSEC  is  marginally  more  granular than the
TCSEC,  the  classes of the TCSEC  may  be  mapped on to the
ITSEC.  This  is done and provided in an appendix.  However,
the converse is  not true; that is,  it  is  not possible to
express the evaluation classes of the  ITSEC in terms of the
TCSEC.

Security functionality for a product is expressed in claims.
There are  no requirements or  design points set forth as in
the TCSEC.  However, the claims may be made  by reference to
a pre-defined set  of  functionality classes.  The  criteria
define ten such classes.  While  the  first five are derived
from  the functionality of  the TCSEC classes C1 thru B3/A1,
they are  essentially arbitrary.  Sub-classes, super-classes
or alternate sets  could be defined without doing damage  to
the structure.  (For example, I have longed claimed that the
commercial  requirement looked something like C2  plus  ACLs
plus named transaction types.  Since  functionality  classes
in the ITSEC are arbitrary, not hierarchical,  and not bound
to assurance, it would  be  correct and proper  to  define a
class that looked like that.)

The more I read it, the better I like it.

The currently released version (3.0) does not yet use Kerberos (at
least so I have been told).
That would be the case for the AFS being released through Mt. Xinu as
well.  Project Athena has modified the authentication program
(klog?) to produce one which scrawls a v4 Kerberos ticket inside
the AFS tokens (aklog), and made corresponding changes for their
server software.

AFS 4 is evidently on the way from Transarc,
as is v5 Kerberos from Athena.  One might expect a merger
of these systems in the future.
These ideas are also being monitored by the Distributed File Systems
working group of the IETF (dfs-wg-request@citi.umich.edu).

Subj:	[2309] Passwords

It seems that most of the replies to requiring password changes came back
against them, and some wondered why, if you have a good password, you should
be required to change it.

One of the computer operating systems here (not a VAX/VMS system) has recently
added a password expiration feature.  Because "the auditors" (cringe) wanted
this, it was implemented.  One surprising thing it turned up was there were a
number of people who had been sharing accounts for years who were not aware of
all the others using the same account... once the password changed, the others
couldn't get in.  These "good" passwords had been shared over time, and rather
than go to the trouble of requesting another account (not much trouble), they
shared accounts.

This, of course, was a problem caused by bad password practices, not bad
passwords.  And, if someone should happen to learn a password by whatever
means, be it a "good" or "bad" one, users may not notice that others are
using their account (how many of us look carefully at the last login date?).

The main advantage of frequent password changes is that if someone does happen
to see you type in your password or learn it by capturing network traffic, etc.,
no matter how careful they are to work undetected, they will eventually be shut
out of your account when you change the password.  Those of us with privileged
accounts have to be extra-careful, as other means of getting in can be set-up
from privileged accounts.  But your users are the ones least likely to realize
that their accounts have been compromised.

     "A password is like a toothbrush: you never share it and you get
                                       a new one every three months."

Subj:	[635] break-in detection

The point at which you are most likely to identify that someone is
breaking into a system is while that person is attempting to gain
access to an account.  Once he has an account USERID and PASSWORD,
detection becomes much more difficult.  Making the authorized users
of a system periodically change their passwords may suddenly deny access
to an unauthorized user, causing him to once again 'hack' at the system
until he gains entry.  This will make him much more visible, and much more
likely to be caught.

Disclaimer: I am, of course, speaking solely for myself.

Subj:	[456] confiscations

The only instance in which I have seen computer equipment confiscated is 
when the person in question is suspected of commiting some computer related 
crime. The situation you are talking about where your equipment was 
confiscated because it "should not be in the hands of the general public" is 
totaly disgusting. I do not know what it could be that you have that could 
pose such a huge threat to the telecommunications industry. What is it?

Subj:	[911] Computer "Crime": Resources and Researchers

I'm interested in researching the nature, history, extent and motivations
behind computer "crime". I'm not sure how to define it at this stage (that
should happen after I've digested a much larger range of views), however I'm
interested in researching system break-ins, computer based fraud and monetary
or property theft, the history and alternative viewpoints behind hacking,
unauthorised copying of software, viruses and any other topic that (at least in
the eyes of some) verges on criminality.

Pointers to key articles, journals, summaries of the literature or even
isolated opinions would be greatly appreciated.

Please don't flame this rather naive request. My opinions are pretty much
unformed (and uninformed) at the moment, so any information can only help.

I'd be happy to post a summary of what I get. Pointers to key personalities
or researchers would also be extremely useful.

Subj:	[1000] FBI folder information.

    Actually I do know of a professor here at Xavier University that did
request his FBI folder. As I recall he had the assistance of a lawyer and
it took several weeks.  What he got was a folder with newspaper clippings about
him and things his is involved with, plus what looked liked memos and notes.
Now not all of this was readable, somethings the FBI deemed 'classified' and
had blackened out words or phrases or sometimes the whole document. So you
could say he got the full folder, you just couldn't *read* it all.

There was a funny side to some of this, it seemed the FBI was very curious
about this 'women' that traveled with him.  They said 'women' because while
they are married, she did not take his name.  They thought it might
be worth noting that he traveled with 'another' women.  That's about all I
have.

I have not actually done this but, as I recall, there is a way to send
a set of your own fingerprints along with a small fee to the FBI and have
them send you back a listing of all the times your fingerprints have been
filed/looked up through them.  This document is traditinally called a "rap
sheet" because for someone who has been frequently arrested it would mostly
be a list of the arrests since you are usually fingerprinted when arrested.
The info is sent back by Registered Mail, deliver to addressee only, so you
have to show ID when the post office delivers it.  I don't know if the last
entry will be your query or if that's added after the query is processed.

Cc: security@pyrite.rutgers.edu

Gould's UNIX was evaluated and certified at the C2 level a long time
ago.  AT&T's System V/MLS was evaluated and certified at the B1 level
last September.  There are several other vendor's versions of UNIX
that are in evaluation at the B1 level. 

I would not associate a C2 as a "poor" rating.  Rather, C2 provides
discretionary access control, audit and several other security services.
The significance of B1 and above is that B1 systems provide mandatory
access control.  In most systems, mandatory access control is implemented
on a label-based mechanism.  This means if the user has a label attached 
to him/her at the "Unclassified" level, there are sufficient mechanisms
and assurances that the user cannot access information (e.g., files, 
directories) at the "Secret" level.  Honeywell's SCOMP was evaluated and
certified at the A1 level and Honeywell's XTS-200 is under evaluation
at the B3 level.

Subj:	[1278] Re: criminal record

Anyone can write to the FBI requesting a copy of their files
under provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.  With some
exceptions, they are obligated to send the files to you.  If they don't
have a file on you when you send in your request, they'll open one, in
the FOIA section.  There's some mumbo-jumbo you're supposed to include
to make sure they check all of the categories, but I don't recall what
that is.  They will delete names of other people if mention would
violate their privacy.  They're also entitled to delete material
pertaining to active criminal investigations, or ``national security''
information.

This info is from memory, but taken from a ACLU newsletter.  As I
recall, they also publish a booklet on the FOIA; if you're serious
about getting your FBI files, I'd try to get the booklet first.  In
general, the government is entitled to collect a modest per-page charge
for FOIA requests, but I'm not sure if that applies to requests of this
nature.

		--Steve Bellovin

P.S.  No, I've never gotten around to asking for my own files, though
I keep meaning to.  I'm not even sure what I want to find out -- if
there's no file on me, it would indicate that I didn't speak up loudly
enough or forcefully enough during my activist days 20 years ago....

Subj:	[1860] Re: Different security ratings
Cc: don@delta.com

Generic Unix has no rating, only specific implementations. The only UNIX
systems on the evaluated products list are:

System				Evaluation Date		Rating
Gould UTX/32S rel 1.0		31 Dec 86		C2
AT&T System V/MLS v1.1.2 on
  UNIX SVR3.1.1 running on
  3B2/500 or 3B2/600		07 Sep 89		B1

Standard UNIX System V has no rating.

Also, C2 is not a "poor" rating by any means. C2 is the best rating that a
UNIX system can get without adding support for Mandatory Access Control.

Assuming an evaluation, operating system extensions can easily extend Unix to
C2, by adding appropriate support for auditing, identification and
authentication, and assurances such as documentation, and testing. B1 can also
be reached easily by adding MAC support. B2 is much harder, because the
assurance requirements state:

   The TCB shall be internally structured into well-defined largely
   independent modules.  It shall make effective use of available hardware to
   separate those elements that are protection-critical from those that are
   not.  The TCB modules shall be designed such that the principle of least
   privilege is enforced.  Features in hardware, such as segmentation, shall
   be used to support logically distinct storage objects with separate
   attributes (namely: readable, writeable).  The user interface to the TCB
   shall be completely defined and all elements of the TCB identified.

UNIX is not well structured internally; reworking a UNIX implementation to B2
would require rewriting major chunks of the kernel.

>I've not heard of an out-of-the-box implementation in the A classification...

First of all, there is only one A classification. On the EPL, there is only
one A1 system, which was the first evaluated system, which is no longer
marketed. If there were more A1 systems on the EPL, they would certainly be
"out of the box" systems.

Subj:	[1841] Re: criminal record

Someone stole my book on the subject, but under the Freedom of Information Act,
federal agencys are required to release information gathered by the agency in
anyform, in most circumstances.  There are set time limits on when the
information is released, (I think the time is started when you make a formal
request for the documentation) and can take a long time to clean, and clear the
red tape.  I belive CBS just recived some information pertaininto Vietnam
requested in the 70's only this year.

I'm sorry I can't be more help, but basically, as I recall, you make a formal
request on paper (Keep a copy) to the records center of the department,
and demand the information, (this is important) including all pages,
title pages, blank pages, markers, notes and tabs, fron and back.

They do have a few exclusions they can hide behind, the FBI is the most
frequent user of these.  They are allowed to edit out any information
that they deem may demonstrate internal workings or investigative
operations of their department.  Besure to request edited pages, and again,
demand, an explanation of EACH edit.

You can also ask that fees be waived, they usally are if the file is small.

I don't recall the time limits and formalities of processing, but sooner
or later it has to come out, but they are great at stalling, and don't
expect much, in FOIA's from the FBI I've examined, they have often
taken a page, Photocopied it, go over each line with a black marker,
and re-copied it, and included it in the requested document as edited.

Explanation and Justification of each edit can help you piece together what
they edited out by looking up the section numbers under which they
will give as justification, usally the one pertaining to the protection
of information gathering techniques.

Subject: Sun Microsystem's Warning System
Date: Wed, 15 Aug 90 15:01:04 EDT
From: Richard Pethia <rdp@cert.sei.cmu.edu>

CERT Tools members,

At the June 1990 Workshop on Computer Security Incident Handling, Sun
Microsystems announced their intent to implement a Customer Warning
System and described several of its characteristics.

Yesterday, the CERT/CC at the SEI received the announcement below.
The announcement, distributed internally to Sun employees, provides
more information on the characteristics of the warning system, and,
more importantly, describes the methods Sun Microsystem's customers
should use to report problems and to sign up to receive warnings from
Sun Microsystems.

Beverly Ulbrich, Sun Product Manager, Software Security, has told us
that a formal press release will probably be released by Sun, but has
asked us to redistribute this announcement to the lists we maintain.  
We are doing so to provide people with information on Sun's action.

Sun's Customer Warning System promises to be a significant step
forward in dealing with computer security incidents and their
prevention, and represents the type of action I would like to see
other vendors take.  

Since the CERT/CC will be actively working with other vendors this
fall and encouraging them to take similar steps, please let me know
about any opinions you have regarding this type of vendor mechanism.

Please direct any questions you have about the specifics of Sun's
mechanism to one of the Sun employees listed below.

Sincerely,
Rich Pethia
CERT Coordinator

Subject:  Announcing Sun Microsystem's Customer Warning System 
                   for Security Incident Handling  

Date:   August 14, 1990

In order to best serve our customers' service needs, Sun has established a 
Customer Warning System (CWS) for handling security incidents.  This is a 
formal process which includes:
	- Having a well advertised point of contact in Sun for reporting 
	  security problems. 			
	- Pro-actively alerting customers of worms, viruses or other security 
	  holes that could affect their systems. 
	- Distributing the patch (and/or work-around) to our customers as 
	  quickly as possible.

More specifically, the CWS is being set up as follows:

We have created an email address ( security-alert@sun ) which will enable 
both internal and external people to have a single place to report security 
problems.  We have provided a voice-mail back-up ( (415)-336-7205 ) for the 
cases where sending email is not possible.   *ALL* SECURITY HOLES SHOULD BE 
REPORTED TO THIS ALIAS.

We have filled the position of "Security Coordinator" in our Customer Service 
Organization.  The Security Coordinator is responsible for manning the email 
and voice mail hotlines and evaluating the security problems.   We have a 
Customer Warning System "SWAT Team" in place to address severe security 
incidents.  The CWS SWAT Team consists of knowledgeable senior people within 
Sun Corporate who are committed to being available to meet whenever required 
and who are empowered to make all necessary decisions.  

We plan on publicizing the CWS bi-monthly to the allsun alias.  It will 
also be announced (and supported) by the various Computer Emergency Response 
Teams Sun works with.  Please pass this information along to whoever you 
feel is appropriate.  Sales Representatives should be certain to send this 
information to all their security-conscious customers!

Customers and Sun Field Offices may send us a "Security Contact" from their
organizations.  This is the person Sun should contact in the case of any 
new security problems.  He or she will be sent information on the problem at 
hand, including work-arounds and how and when to obtain fixes.  Preferably, 
your Security Contact should be technical.  He or she should be your site's 
System Administrator (or System Security Administrator).  The information we 
need for the Security Contact from the three geographies for customers is as 
follows:

---------------------- U.S. Security Contact Information --------------------

Company Name:
Security Contact's Name:
Customer Number (from Cullinet):
Address ID (from Cullinet)*:

Subj:	[664] Chubb Locks

Hi There.
	We use a Chubb 8108 system controlling 3 Chub 8100 door controllers,
and here's our problem.  Every now and then (we've had them since December
1989) one of the 8100s will go haywire and start running (on the two doors
it controls) through a cycle of <Locked>,<Enter PIN>,<Unlocked>.  During
the unlock part, the door will be unlocked for about half a second.

The cycling will continue until the unit has been reset.  We would like
to know if anyone else has had this problem, as it can be a real pain.
The Chubb guys said it was bad earthing, then 2 months later it was back
again, after the problem had apparently been fixed.

Anyone got any ideas.

Subj:	[1511] Userid maintenance Automation

When I had to do something similar a few years ago, (we had students
coming in for 1 to 3 month classes; we'd have to create a block of
between 20 and 300 userids before the class, and delete them afterwards),
I wrote an exec that would be given the class number (which determined
the student prefix), and the number of IDs needed, and it would
(1)  Create that number of userids, from XYZ001 to XYZnnn;
(2)  Create a SCRIPT file that printed off a Welcome to the Computer
     letter, specifying their userid and randomly generated password; and
(3)  Printed out mailing labels for these letters.

It could also be called to delete the userids en mass after the class
was over.

It's all pretty easy.  The only time-consuming thing was tracing through
DIRMAINT and all the stuff it calls until I located the DVH module that
actually sent the DIRM ADD request to the DIRMAINT machine.  I then
called that routine directly.  That way, my exec could ask for the
privileged user's password once, and use it for all the calls to the
lower-level module.

(Eventually, I got fancy, and had the exec pass the arguments to a
privileged service machine, which would do all the DIRM requests, and
interpret the output and only bother me if anything went wrong.  It would
also by default (could be overridden) wait until 2:00 AM to issue the
request, so that the DIRMAINT service machines wouldn't be tied up
adding hundreds of users during prime shift.)

Under the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act, they are
required to send you the entire folder, with a few exceptions:

	1. Ongoing investigations are exempt.
	2. Information that could endanger field operatives may be censored.
	3. Other "classified" information can be removed.

Most people, turns out, don't have FBI folders on them.  Unless you
lived in the 1950s and 1960s and were an activist, that is.  If you
did, you can get your folder by contacting your local FBI office; they
have an address that you can send a notorized letter to asking for
your folder.  You have to provide some personal information, but not a
whole lot.

I did it; I didn't have a folder (at the time), disproving the
assertion that all MIT students automatically get FBI folders when
they register.

For "locker" style Master combo locks, you can probably doe the
combinatorics of the "soft spots" on it in under 10 minutes.
Some of the newer ones seem to have an extra mechanism to make it harder
to detect these points.... I've taken to actually writing down my combo
with these as it is such a pain to discover the combo from
experimentation...  Even so, the right answer is to figure out the combo
rather than use any of the cruder methods you listed.

There exists a book that lists all of the combinations by serial

you own the lock, they may look it up for you.  I find it scary that
the relationship exists.

Personally, I prefer to use key locks with the serial/key number
written in ink (I erase the number) or to use locks for which I set
the combination.  At least someone can't look up the number in a handy
book.

Subj:	[735] Re: cheap Master combo lock

     When I was a kid, a fellow camper showed me how to crack the
standard everywhere present master combo lock.

     Basically the idea was to find the first number by pulling
the shank out and turning the knob.  It would click or stick or
feel different at the place that corresponded to the first
number.

     The third number was easy to find, assuming you had the first and
second number, all you had to do was turn the dial until the shank pulled
open.

     Finding the second number was a matter of trying each one, not
that many.  It made it even easier in that the second number was
'accurate' only to 2 digits, so you only had to try every other
position to get the right one.

     I opened many a master lock this way.

        I had the same problem about a year ago and the solution was painless.
Go to the nearest hardware store that handles MasterLock locks. Explain to
someone there ( I approached the key-making department ) what the problem is,
get the address of the nearest MasterLock outlet or corporate headquarters,
and write a letter to them, explaining who you are, what the serial number of
the combination lock is, and giving the full address of the hardware store
you have made accommodations with. MasterLock will send the combination to
the hardware store ( authorized dealer ), where you can have them call you
or stop in periodically to check if it's arrived. No problem if you've got
the time.

Subj:	[1151] Password Servers

We have an ethernetted environment of many UNIX boxes all
running a fairly old application.  The users of the application
do *not* rlogin to different machines; they just log onto the box
over a LAN, then they log off when they're done (only the people 
who provide support use rlogin).  The only use of client server 
programs is for locally developed systems to fix problems in the 
application.

The application was implemented with many group ids (which are
going away -> towards individual user ids).  As we're proceeding
in this direction, we're thinking about a password server running
as a client/server over the ethernet (implemented so that the
users are unaware that there's a password server or anything
magical).

I've read most of the Kerberos documents and while I'm amazed, it
seems like overkill for our environment (none of the users even
know what a program is let alone a client/server).

Does anything exist like a password server?  Something simpler
than Kerberos doing login authentication?

Suggestions welcome!  Pointers to articles or research welcome!
Thoughts and inspirations equally welcome!

        Yes, but if the users choose good passwords, there won't be much 
chance of anyone getting in at all. One good method is using a variety of 
upper & lower case (ie pAsSwOrD) on UNIXs that will alow you to do that. 
Another system which would make it nearly impossible to hack (beleive me, I 
know) would be to take two words, combine them together and add a two-digit 
number to the end (ie RUNWALK23)..If password security is not enough for 
your system you may wish to invest in a filter 
device, which will dramaticly reduce the numbe of people who even make it to 
the "password:" prompt. It is important, however, that even when you get one 
of these, you must still use good passwords.  That should drasticly reduce 
the amount of unwanted visitors on your system.

Subj:	[1748] New Book of Interest

I just received a copy of the book "Rogue Programs: Viruses, Worms,
and Trojan Horses," edited by Lance J. Hoffman.  The book is published
by Van Nostrand Reinhold, copyright 1990, ISBN 0-442-00454-0.  The
publisher's suggested list price is $32.95, in softcover.

This book is a collection of 27 articles and book excerpts about
"vandalware" on computer systems.  Contributors include Len Adleman,
Anne Branscomb, David Chess, Fred Cohen, George Davida, David
Ferbrache, Michael Gemignani, Harold Joseph Highland, me (!), Ken
Thompson, Steve White, and many others.  The table of contents lists
the following parts: Overview of Rogue Programs, Social and Legal
Issues and Effects, Rogue Programs and Personal Computers, Rogue
Programs and Networks, and Emerging Theory of Computer Viruses.

Perhaps I'm somewhat biased because I'm the author or co-author of 3
of the 27 contributions.  However, I believe this is the most
comprehensive collection on the topic currently available.  It
contains case studies, theoretical analyses, legal opinions, and
step-by-step technical information.  The book is valuable as both a
technical reference and as a textbook around which a course can be
organized.  I'm sure it is going to become one of the 2 or 3 standard
references in the field (the forthcoming book from ACM Press edited by
Peter Denning will probably be the other).

If you are interested in some of the issues involving viruses, worms
and vandalware, you really should get a copy of this book and check it
out.

Subj:	[2935] Another long hiatus

I have been very busy moving my entire life and stuff to Boston, and have had
utterly *no* time to deal with the list for the last few weeks.  I now intend
to shovel out all the back messages, but I wanted to ping the readership at
large first and get a few opinions about the relative worth of keeping this
list going.

I have often toyed with the idea of just taking it down completely.  I seem
to be perpetually too busy to get things out on what you'd call a timely
basis.  More importantly, most of the recent submissions seem to either be
about things that have been discussed in the past, or are questions about
very specific and narrow fields of interest that often serve to only confuse
the readers who don't know anything about it.  Many questions could be
answered by digging around through the archives, which are all still online
from the lists's inception.  Over the years a fairly useful body of knowledge
has been captured there, and it's been my suspicion that we've just sort of
reached our horizon of getting new knowledge into there.  I could be quite
wrong about this since new security topics are always coming out, but I
see definite repeating patterns here.

The other thing is that there is now this alt.security newsgroup.  This is a
completely unmoderated instant-turnaround group, which sort of flies in the
face of this list's original philosophy.  Any clown could send in "gee, I
found this really cute hole under Buglix 5.2 and here's how to reproduce it",
raising a certain flame war as well as possible liability issues or at least
the wrath of local system folks.  Moderation, it was hoped way back when, was
one way to avoid this sort of thing.  I even took pains to run the list in
such a way that someone couldn't just "VRFY security-outbound" or some such
and obtain the distribution list for themselves.  Of course anyone could send
this sort of message to just about any group, so the question here is: Just
what does a moderated list do for people?  Should it remain moderated?  I have
noticed that the signal-to-noise ratio on alt.security is at the typically
low Usenet-like level.  I do reject a good proportion of mangled, irrelevant,
stupid, or redundant messages, but being such a filter is a rather tedious
job even with a multitude of tools at one's disposal.

So I solicit opinions from the readership.  Should the security list become an
unmoderated reflector?  Should it just shrivel under the onslaught of
alt.security and just vanish, leaving only its archives?  Should the task [and
I don't use the word lightly] of moderation pass on to someone else with more
time to do it?  I do wish I had the time to do as thorough a job as, say, PGN
with RISKS; but with new locations and new jobs and scads of loose ends to wrap
up such is not to be the case.

Suggestions and such will be accepted at my address, security, security-
request, etc; it all points to my mailbox anyway.

feeling more "settled in" at this point and actually having some time to read
my mail and deal with it, tells me that it's to everyone's benefit to continue
the list as is.  Those of you who felt I should hang it up can always ask to
be removed.

So things will start flowing again; you'll see a lot of old msgs at first.  I
may have to fake out the dates on them to get them through various peoples'

Unfortunately, experience on the SPAN network, for example, shows that
most "break-ins"
 require no "breaking" to speak of.  They are the result of users 
with easily guessed account names and passwords, passwords the same
as account names, and system managers who leave the default maintenance
passwrods active after installing their systems.

Detecting these may be virtually impossible with a careful hacker.  Most
often you will see the trail of failed access attempts if they roam 
around the system trying to nose into files.

Cc: Craig_Everhart@transarc.com, Mike_Kazar@transarc.com

A recent message in this newsgroup regarding Kerberos support in AFS 3.0
was recently brought to my attention.  Though I don't regularly read
this group I thought it would be helpful to post a correction.

I wrote the Authentication Server which is contained in version 3.0 of AFS.
The server is RPC based and thus does not look exactly like a Kerberos
server; perhaps this is the source of the confusion.  However, inter-
operability with Kerberos from MIT's Project Athena was one of our primary
concerns.  To this end, our server uses the Kerberos V4 ticket format
and exports the same UDP interface for the authentication and ticket
granting services.  The admin services are only available via RPC and
so these do not match the usual Kerberos semantics.

The file servers use Kerberos tickets which can come from either our
Auth Server or from a standard Kerberos server.  What MIT has done is
write a program which copies a ticket for the afs server obtained from
their Kerberos server and copies it into the kernel.  This allows the
cache manager (client side of the file server) to use it when fetching
files from the file server.

As far as I am aware, MtXinu is distributing a Mach version of AFS 3.0
which has the same behavior WRT Kerberos.  Indeed, AFS 4.0 will use
Kerberos V5 tickets.

I hope this clears up any confusion regarding this issue, without being
too long winded.

Five minutes?  You can pick a Master (keyed) padlock in 1/5 that time.
They are only 4 pin locks, and the pins are so sloppy that they make a
great "learning" lock.

The reason that Master's pick so easily is that they made an
interesting (but poor, in my opinion) design decision.  The Master's
I've seen have a two diameter top pin.

	cylinder split end

		 | |
		|   |

	      Spring end

The reduced diameter section makes you pick the pins twice.  This
means that for a four pin lock you must pick the equivalent of an
eight pins lock.  This is good.

The problem is that the first stage picking is trivial - the reduced
diameter section is so tall compared to the normal tolerance of a
split.  The second stage picking is aided by the pin itself.  It stops
moving up when you get to the right place.  Good grief.

The moral, buy a real lock for anything you want to secure.  Often one
can re-pin a cheap lock with mushroom pins or pins with a set of kerfs
cut in them to thwart picking.  If customers stop buying junk like
master padlocks, then we will see a growing trend towards locks that
really work.

Subj:	[1943] RSCS Security PRPQ
Cc: jej@chinet.chi.il.us

In response to the infamous CHISTMAS CARD exec, IBM developed and has now made
available as a PRPQ what they term the File Safestor Facility, PRPQ# P81061.
Its a no-cost PRPQ that "is a file receipt discipline which guards a user's
environment from being changed inadvertently.  As such it provides some
protection against computer virus-type attacks. (It) flags a file's entrance
into a given system (while still in the VM RDR) and "safely" stores it onto
disk with the filetype inverted (spelled backwards).  Inverting the filetype
renders the file non-executable and protects the user against the inadvertent
execution of that file and possible propagation of the file to other systems."

Another free PRPQ is number P81067, the Gateway Security Modifications.
"The Gateway Security Modifications system ... force it (RSCS) to consult a
security table for every attempted transaction.  The only transactions that
are not checked for security are commands issued from the RSCS console, and
commands and messages from other RSCS operators to the local RSCS operator
console.  An RSCS Operator is a user who has an AUTH statement in the RSCS
CONFIG file of the Gateway Security Modifications.

The last PRPQ is P81068, Selective File Filter.
"Upon identifying undesirable files on a selective file filter node, an
authorized operator or support programmer can create and update a lookup
table containing file name and file type of files deemed undesirable.  The
lookup table will be updated via a new RSCS command BADFILE.

The lookup table is searched every time a file arrives in the RSCS' reader.
If the file name and file type are found in the table, the file will be
either purged or trandferred to the security machine, and a file counter,
identified as potential virus files, will be incremented."

It wasn't mentioned in the original request, but there is also a PRPQ for
Passthru, #P81070, Access Security Exits.

I hope this helps.

I am interested in making my house resistant to breaking and entering,
as opposed to detecting the same with an alarm system.  

* I am considering burglar bars on the basement casement windows.  The
main drawback seems to be fire exit.  These bars swing open, and are
secured with a lock (on the inside).  I'm not too concerned about fire
exit in this case because the windows would be very difficult to use
due to small size and height from the floor, so an extra 30 seconds to
unlock seems minor.  I'm not sure how strong the wood casement that
holds the bars is, however, so this might be more show than effect.

* Traditional wood frame doors seem pretty wimpy.  Our main doors are
kind of drafty in the winter, too.  I think I'll put in steel
doors/frames with deadbolts.  Might pay for themselves after a few
winters. 

* What about the windows?  I just saw a reference to mylar security
film - anyone know what this is?  I don't want bars on the real
windows, and plastic plates (lucite?) with explosive bolts for fire
exit sounds like too much trouble.  The first floor windows on this
house are about six feet up from the ground - how vulnerable is this
in reality?

Subj:	[1314] Burglar Alarms -- Beware of cheap parts

A little ways back I posed the question to the net as to what may cause
spuratic, seemingrandom triggers of an armed alarm on a still day, the alarm
being compmosed of two simple loops with only two contact switches and the
rest vibration sensors.  The responses were quite helpful in pinpointing the
problem; it was suggested that resistance was accumulating in the circuit
perhaps due to a staple through a wire or a bad switcleading to the eventual
threshhold exceedance.

Well, after two years with this problem, I narrowed the problem down to a
defect inherant in the part!  I don't have the catelog no. handy, but a phone
conversation with Tandy's engineers in Texas confirmed that the silver mixture
used in the contacts of the switch oxidize extremely rapidly.  His solution
was to either file the contacts every 3-5 months with emery cloth, spray them
with a conducting oil (only a temporary solution) or wait till they come up
with a replacement part for it (and we all know how long THAT can take)
*sigh*.

Isn't it comforting to know that defective parts that people rely on for
safety and protection remain on the shelves going unnoticed by the consumer
AND the dealers? (detect sarcasm)

Does anyone know of any good manufactures of vibration-type switches??  Any
help would be greatly appreciated.

Subj:	[454] Wanted: Simple Voice Scrambler Schematic.

I am looking for a simple voice scrambler to use over standard us
telephones. 
The requirements are quite easily met as well (I hope) it beeds to
encrypt/decrypt both sides of the conversation at the same time. And I
would prefer not to have a clip-on type device, it would be great if it
could go between the handset and telephone, or phone and wall jack, or
internal to the handset.

References to books/magazine articles are welcome.

We might note with satisfaction that this is a Good Thing resulting from
a Usenix workshop on Unix security held in Portland two years ago.  Sun
had a person there (Chuck McManis, maybe others), and asked the group
for recommendations.  At the time Sun had people in charge of each
software component, but nobody assigned to "security" over the whole
software system.  The group recommended that vendors should have a
single point-of-contact for security problem reports.

Subj:	[635] AFS betas

The CMU undergrad who wrote of his troubles with AFS perhaps
was reacting to beta software because that lab last summer WAS
running beta AFS and until this year it was not stable on
Ultrix kernels (owing to the unusual Ultrix extensions for
networked files). Nevertheless, AFS does support large (thousands
of systems) nets sharing files transparently and globally. Internal
experience here is that it's death to try this with NFS even
operationally. Since cross-mounting over bridges is a problem, the
spoofing problem NFS is open to is not considered widely (a dead
network is perfectly secure...just perfectly useless also.)

Subj:	[1786] re: Chubb locks [problems]

> Anyone got any ideas?

yep.....several

1) Check the ground again.  Make sure it is good.  If not, then fix the
   situation (longer copper rod in the ground, or if you are in a part of
    the country that has a problem getting a good ground, adding salt around
   the ground rod on a regular basis sometimes helps...

2) Open the CPU for the controllers.....has anything made it's/their home
   in there? You wouldn't believe what one spider can do

3) Are any pipes running over the CPU?  I once had condensation *SOMETIMES*
   drip from the damn pipe, into the air vent, and onto a chip.  The water
   droplet would temp. short out two legs on the chip, and cause telephones
   connected to the CPU (KSU) to ring non-stop until the water evaporated.
   Insulating the pipe corrected the problem.

4) Is your power goofy like everyone's?  Try a good quality surge supressor,
   and failing that, hook the thing up to a zero-transfer time UPS (try Best
   Power Systems...).  You'd be amazed at how many "glitches" disappear when
   the power is cleaned

5) A component is failing.  Try the usual freon blast to cool the suckers
   to see if it has an effect.

6) The CPU PC board has a cracked trace.  When the board is cool, the trace
    is making contact.  As the board heats, the crack in the trace expands,
    creating your problem.

Intermittants are hard to track down, but analyzing the surrounding
circumstances/environment/physical location help enormously....

Mr. Max Frankel,
Executive Editor
The New York Times
229 West 43rd Street
New York, NY 10036

Dear Mr. Frankel:

Your article, "Washington is Relaxing Its Stand on Guarding
Computer Security", by John Markoff, August 19, reflects a
serious misinterpretation of both the intent and the probable
effect of the new Presidential directive on computer security.

The new directive replaces NSDD #145, which was issued by the
Reagan administration in 1984. With the authority of that older
directive, and because they were not willing to accept the
utterly mundane, unexciting nature of the data security problems
in most agencies, the National Security Agency (NSA) distorted
the data security implementations of many federal civil agencies
and reduced the effectiveness of their computer security
programs.

NSA's computer security efforts were oriented exclusively about
the protection of classified data from disclosure to those who
did not have appropriate security clearances. Their development
program did not address the need for data to be complete,
accurate, timely and available. They were concerned only with the
confidentiality of data and wholly unconcerned about their
usefulness to their proper owners.

It has been an unfortunate NSA assumption that those with
appropriate security clearances can be trusted to the level of
their clearances. This ignores the damage which has been done in
recent years by Messrs Walker, Pelton, Pollard, Boyce, Smith,
Miller, et al, all of whom were cleared for access to the data
which they delivered to those who appeared, until recently, to be
the enemy. There seems to be no basis for a belief that
comparable damage has been done through technically-oriented,
foreign-directed penetrations of our systems containing
classified data.

Fortunately, the new directive relieves the civil agencies from a
requirement that they continue to accept misleading guidance in
computer security from NSA. Unfortunately, it was not issued not
until significant damage had already been done.

The Computer Security Act of 1987 gives the National Institute
for Standards and Technology (NIST) responsibility for providing
technical guidance in computer security to the civil agencies and
DoD for the protection of their unclassified data. It is
regrettable that NIST is very poorly funded for work in the
computer security area and, at the current funding levels, cannot
provide any significant amount of the technical leadership in
computer security so badly needed by the civil agencies.

Only a small portion of funds previously available to NSA for
computer security would permit NIST to provide the needed
guidance. Whether those funds are provided or not, the new and
wisely conceived directive will not result in relaxation of the
security afforded data by either DoD or the civil agencies. The
new directive rectifies a serious error of the previous
administration and makes it probable that data security in the
civil agencies will improve - not as much as it would if NIST had
adequate funding and not as much as it should, but it will be
improved. The contrary impression conveyed by your reporter is
unfortunate.

                                     Sincerely,

                                     Robert H. Courtney, Jr.
