Along these same lines, not long ago an individual received a certain
dubious notoriety for picking the "impossible to crack" (press term, not
mine) locks securing coin-operated public telephones. Is *anything* really
"impossible to crack"? I may be wrong, but this sounds to me like another
case of media hype surrounding a breach of relatively poor security.
Yes? No? Maybe?

[Moderator add-on: Yes, the "pay phone thief" was discussed at length around
a year ago.  Nobody ever really knew if it was for real.  I can dig up the

That of course assumes that you are alert!  A typical user logs in with
his/her brains in neutral.

Anyhow, it is not enough to protect you against a more sophisticated attack.

A year or so back, users of the Cambridge University Computing Service were 
hit by a password grabber which infested the BBC Micros used as terminals.  
This program passed through all data in both directions, and kept a record 
in RAM of the characters that users typed in response to certain prompts 
(like "Password: ").

That doesn't work either.

If there is a possibility of someone EITHER tampering with your terminal OR
eavesdropping on your comm's system, you must have an authentication scheme 
that uses encrypted timestamps and challenges to get secure login.

Subject: Viruses and System Security (a story)

The following story was posted in news.sysadmin recently.

The more things change, the more they stay the same...

Back in the mid-1970s, several of the system support staff at Motorola
(I believe it was) discovered a relatively simple way to crack system
security on the Xerox CP-V timesharing system (or it may have been
CP-V's predecessor UTS).  Through a simple programming strategy, it was
possible for a user program to trick the system into running a portion
of the program in "master mode" (supervisor state), in which memory
protection does not apply.  The program could then poke a large value
into its "privilege level" byte (normally write-protected) and could
then proceed to bypass all levels of security within the file-management
system, patch the system monitor, and do numerous other interesting
things.  In short, the barn door was wide open.

Motorola quite properly reported this problem to XEROX via an official
"level 1 SIDR" (a bug report with a perceived urgency of "needs to be
fixed yesterday").  Because the text of each SIDR was entered into a
database that could be viewed by quite a number of people, Motorola
followed the approved procedure: they simply reported the problem as
"Security SIDR", and attached all of the necessary documentation,
ways-to-reproduce, etc. separately.

Xerox apparently sat on the problem... they either didn't acknowledge
the severity of the problem, or didn't assign the necessary
operating-system-staff resources to develop and distribute an official
patch.

Time passed (months, as I recall).  The Motorola guys pestered their
Xerox field-support rep, to no avail.  Finally they decided to take
Direct Action, to demonstrate to Xerox management just how easily the
system could be cracked, and just how thoroughly the system security
systems could be subverted.

They dug around through the operating-system listings, and devised a
thoroughly devilish set of patches.  These patches were then
incorporated into a pair of programs called Robin Hood and Friar Tuck.
Robin Hood and Friar Tuck were designed to run as "ghost jobs" (daemons,
in Unix terminology);  they would use the existing loophole to subvert
system security, install the necessary patches, and then keep an eye on
one another's statuses in order to keep the system operator (in effect,
the superuser) from aborting them.

So... one day, the system operator on the main CP-V software-development 
system in El Segundo was surprised by a number of unusual phenomena.
These included the following (as I recall... it's been a while since I
heard the story):

-  Tape drives would rewind and dismount their tapes in the middle of a
   job.

-  Disk drives would seek back&forth so rapidly that they'd attempt to
   walk across the floor.

-  The card-punch output device would occasionally start up of itself
   and punch a "lace card" (every hole punched).  These would usually
   jam in the punch.

-  The console would print snide and insulting messages from Robin Hood
   to Friar Tuck, or vice versa.

-  The Xerox card reader had two output stackers;  it could be
   instructed to stack into A, stack into B, or stack into A unless a
   card was unreadable, in which case the bad card was placed into
   stacker B.  One of the patches installed by the ghosts added some
   code to the card-reader driver... after reading a card, it would flip
   over to the opposite stacker.  As a result, card decks would divide
   themselves in half when they were read, leaving the operator to
   recollate them manually.

I believe that there were some other effects produced, as well.

Naturally, the operator called in the operating-system developers.  They
found the bandit ghost jobs running, and X'ed them... and were once
again surprised.  When Robin Hood was X'ed, the following sequence of
events took place:

  !X id1

  id1:   Friar Tuck... I am under attack!  Pray save me!  (Robin Hood)
  id1: Off (aborted)

  id2: Fear not, friend Robin!  I shall rout the Sheriff of Nottingham's men!

  id3: Thank you, my good fellow! (Robin)

Each ghost-job would detect the fact that the other had been killed, and
would start a new copy of the recently-slain program within a few
milliseconds.  The only way to kill both ghosts was to kill them
simultaneously (very difficult) or to deliberately crash the system.

Finally, the system programmers did the latter... only to find that the
bandits appeared once again when the system rebooted!  It turned out
that these two programs had patched the boot-time image (the /vmunix
file, in Unix terms) and had added themselves to the list of programs
that were to be started at boot time...

The Robin Hood and Friar Tuck ghosts were finally eradicated when the
system staff rebooted the system from a clean boot-tape and reinstalled
the monitor.  Not long thereafter, Xerox released a patch for this
problem.

I believe that Xerox filed a complaint with Motorola's management about
the merry-prankster actions of the two employees in question.  To the
best of my knowledge, no serious disciplinary action was taken against
either of these guys.

Several years later, both of the perpetrators were hired by Honeywell,
which had purchased the rights to CP-V after Xerox pulled out of the
mainframe business.  Both of them made serious and substantial
contributions to the Honeywell CP-6 operating system development effort.
Robin Hood (Dan Holle) did much of the development of the PL-6
system-programming language compiler; Friar Tuck (John Gabler) was one
of the chief communications-software gurus for several years.  They're
both alive and well, and living in LA (Dan) and Orange County (John).
Both are among the more brilliant people I've had the pleasure of
working with.

Disclaimers: it has been quite a while since I heard the details of how
this all went down, so some of the details above are almost certainly
wrong.  I shared an apartment with John Gabler for several years, and he
was my Best Man when I married back in '86... so I'm somewhat
predisposed to believe his version of the events that occurred.

Subj:	[968] more sophisticated medecos

   Our campus key shop guru told me that we have even a more advanced
   Medeco than the standard, and was almost foolproof...

I believe that these are the biaxials. They are no big deal; the chisel points
are offset forward or back by .025".  It effectively gives each pin twice the
keying versatility, since the key cut can be the right depth and twist, but if
it's not under the chisel tip, you lose.  A master key for this system would
have two cuts right next to each other that would address either offset [and I
believe they would be at the same height, since it's difficult to cut two
different heights only .050" apart and have enough "meat" left to turn the
pin].  With regard to picking, it essentially makes no difference.  In fact, it
was a biaxial that I first started working with to develop the current
theory..

Lessee, (6 cuts * 3 rotations * 2 offsets) = 36 positions per pin, to the 6th
power gives you something like 2 gigapossibilities...

Subj:	[2817] collision in DES

We (Jean-Paul Delescaille and Jean-Jacques Quisquater) were able
to find 3 collisions in DES using a network of workstations 
during some weeks.

Definition of a collision: given a message M and an cryptographic
algorithm f with 2 parameters M and K (the key), a collision is a
pair (K1, K2) such that

  f (M, K1) = f (M, K2),

that is, for a fixed message M and using a cryptographic 
algorithm f, the key K1 and the key K2 give the SAME encrypted 
message.

Jean-Jacques devised a new probabilistic distributed asynchronous
algorithm for finding collisions without any sorting and with a 
small storage (a la Pollard). We used a fast implementation of 
DES in C (by Jean-Paul: about 2000 * (encryption + change of key)
/second/machine)

We used the idle time of a network of 20 SUN-3's and 10 microVAXes 
(a la Lenstra and Manasse). Total: about 100 Mips during one month.

 37
2  encryptions performed (about 20 potential collisions) only in
software!

The message M is 0404040404040404 (hexadecimal form) for
the 3 collisions.

Collision 1: found Fri Jan 13 23:15 GMT (birthday of Jean-Jacques!
Yes, it is another birthday attack (Hi! Don Coppersmith)).

   cipher = F02D67223CEAF91C
   K1     = 4A5AA8D0BA30585A
   K2     = suspense!

Collision 2: found Fri Jan 20 19:13 GMT

   cipher = E20332821871EB8F
   K1, K2 = suspense!

Collision 3; found Fri Feb  3 03:22 GMT

   suspense!

Conclusion: Friday is a good day for finding collisions :-)

Well, there is a problem because there is no proof we effectively
found such collisions. 

Question 1: Find a protocol for proving or for convincing you
that we know K2 for collision 1 (zero-knowledge protocols are useful
in this context).

Question 2: Find a protocol for proving or convincing that we know
K1 and K2 for collision 2 (idem).

Question 3: Find a protocol for proving or convincing that we know
3 different collisions (idem).

Useful information: the nice paper by Brassard, Chaum and Crepeau,
``Minimum disclosure proofs of knowledge'', 1987.

The complete information will be given at EUROCRYPT '89, Houthalen, 
Belgium, with the restriction that the submitted abstract is
accepted :-) The paper will be sent in April if you want it.

Thanks are due to Paul Branquart, Frans Heymans, Michel Lacroix, 
Vincent Marlair, Marc Vauclair, the members of PRLB for permission
and active help in the effective implementation of the distributed 
algorithm on their workstations.

Warning: There is no implication about the security of DES used
for encryption. Indeed these experiments only prove that DES is a
good random mapping (a necessary property for any cryptographic
algorithm). However the use of DES for protecting the integrity of files
is not very easy and needs very careful studies.

(Program chairman of EUROCRYPT '89)

Here at UC Davis, we are doing research on computer viruses under the
direction of Lawrence Livermore Nat'l Lab.  Here at UCD, we write 
anti-viral programs and virus detectors.  We ship them to LLNL and
they test them there on a completely isolated system with viruses
which they have.  Now, supposed that someone accidentally attached an
Ethernet cable to this isolated system.  What happens now?  A virus is
released on the Internet unintentionally.  No one gets any
satisfaction from seeing this happen.  However, there is a legitimate
purpose for writing these viruses.
If R. Morris really didn't mean to release his worm onto the Internet,
imagine the horror he probably felt when he realized what he had done
(put yourself in his shoes! :-) No flames, please.  I don't want to
debate RTM's guilt or innocence.).  So, what's the point?  The point
is that there are legitimate reasons for writing viruses, worms, etc.
How can one defend against a virus unless they have one to look at?

I am following the current deliberations of the 802.10 committee on this
issue.  Tony Bono had what I consider a good original proposal for an
architecture to deal with the issue.  Apparently, the committee could
not shoot down the proposal, but because he did not give a detailed
functional specification (which was not what I understood to have been
originally requested), the committee decided that they would only
provide security procedures at the boundary between LLC and the MAC
(based on pairwise MAC addresses) and not at the boundary between the
Network Layer and LLC based on LSAP/DSAP pairs for a given MAC layer
connection.  Personally, I can think of many reasons why one might want
to provide pairwise LSAP/DSAP security rather than simply point-to-point
MAC address based security.  It seems to me perfectly reasonable that
Network Management communications streams, OSI communications streams or
TCP/IP communications streams might all require different security
procedures at the boundary between LLC and the network layer. 

Personally, I would think distributed multi-level security would be a
nice thing.  Providing security procedures on a per LSAP/DSAP basis
would give the possibility of multi-level security at the link-layer, so
that a given host might be able to realize that a given data stream from
a host was trusted at a secret level because the user had logged into
the console in a room guarded by guys with machine guns while another
data stream from the same host was not trusted at all because the user
had dialed in from outside. 

I see this situation all the time.  Everytime someone wants to
incorporate some new idea into OSI which actually give some reason to
switch from TCP/IP to OSI, it gets shot down at the committee level. 
Now I understand why the best standards are those which were ad hoc
standards first, and only much later standardized by the international
committees.  Any comments?

Subj:	[2105] Virus Legislation

Spock,

In answer to your questions...

1.  Background behind viri:  Everybody's stories differ.

2.  Good Books on Viri:  None.  Now, to answer your question:  Books
    are present, but they may not be good:  I have one called:
    "The Computer Virus Crisis" authors: Fites/Johnson/Kratz 
    Publisher: Van Nostrand Reinhold, NY NY  I bought this one because
    it has skads of references in the back, & its copyright Jan 1989.
    I found it in a local B. Dalton store (in the nonfiction section)

3.  Legislation:  You asked the right person.  My office-mate is now
    looking through his stash of info, and already has found a 
    20-page paper titled, "Computer Crime Legislation" dated Nov 1987.
    I won't bore the readers of this list with a long-winded 
    description of which states have what laws, but in general, there
    are: "The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act"
         Fed Law TITLE 18 Part I Sect. 1029; 
         (same law)       Part I Chapt 47 Sect 1030
                                 Chapt 119 sects 2510-2521
                                 Chapt 121 sects 2701-2709
    All states except Arkansas, Indiana, Vermont, and West Virginia
    had at least one statute as of the time of the paper.

4.  Newer Legislation: Rep Wally Herger (R-Cal) introduced HR 5061 
    last July (The Computer Virus Eradication Act of 1988) but 
    Congress was not able to vote on it last year.  He re-introduced 
    the same bill (now called HR 55) on Jan 3, 1989; 42 House members
    are currently co-sponsors.  Who knows when this one will be voted
    upon.  This is different from the above law because this one 
    covers EVERYONE, while the above law only covered Government 
    computers.

5.  The "Computer Security Act of 1987" (HR 145), which you may have
    heard of, has nothing to do with Computer Fraud or Viruses.

6.  I heard a rumor through the mill that Morris is getting off with 
    nothing but a slap on the wrist because the places he affected 
    don't want to get together to really give it to him.

Subj:	[1334] Virus psychology information

In response to "Commander Spock"'s question about sources of information
on why people write virus's, I suggest he look at a few recent magazine
articles (I really doubt any books have been on the topic as of yet)

In the Summer issue of 2600 magazine there is an article by "The Plague"
called "How to Write a Virus: The Dark Side of Viruses".  He claims to have
written a viruse called CyberAIDS which attacks the Apple II series, but
besides his "qualifications" you can get a pretty good idea of the twisted
kind of mind who enjoy this kind of thing (Mr. "Plague" claims to have no
moral objections to trashing people's hard work)  The article goes into
the theory of virus writing (not system specific)  A careful reading between
the lines can provide a psycological outline of one kind of virus writer.

you can get a back issue of 2600 by writing to 2600 Magazine, PO Box 752,

Subj:	[1395] Certification of Software

Hello netters, we are going to start a European
initiative on software certification (SWC) and therefor we would
appreciate to receive any information on
 - needs for SWC
 - objectives for SWC
 - effective procedures for SWC
 - tools for SWC
 - who is doing SWC
 - who should  do SWC
 - etc.
Certification, in our view, includes all methods and procedures do
validate, verify, test examine, measure or  assess software as a
product or software beeing developed by a 'certified' development
process.

Thanks for any help.

The following conference may be of interest to this distribution list:
======================================================================
                             CRYPTO '89
                          CALL FOR PAPERS

The Ninth Annual Crypto Conference sponsored by the International
Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR) in cooperation with the
IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Security and Privacy, and
the Computer Science Department of the University of California, Santa
Barbara, will be held on the campus of the University of California,
Santa Barbara, on August 20-24, 1989.  Original research papers and
technical expository talks are solicited on all practical and
theoretical aspects of cryptology.  It is anticipated that some talks
may also be presented by special invitation of the Program Committee.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR AUTHORS:  Authors are requested to send ten copies of
a detailed abstract (not a full paper) by March 17, 1989, to the
Program Chairperson at the address given below.   Abstracts should
contain sufficient detail, as well as references to and comparisons
with relevant extant work, to enable Program Committee members to
appreciate their merits. It is recommended that abstracts start with a
succinct statement of the problem and discussion of its significance
and relevance to cryptology, appropriate for a non-specialist reader.
In order to facilitate blind refereeing, the names of authors and
their affiliations should only appear on the cover page of the paper;
it should be possible to remove this page and send the papers to
Program Committee members.  Limits of 10 double-spaced pages and 2500
words (not counting the bibliography and the cover page) are placed on
all abstracts. If the authors believe that more details are essential
to substantiate the main claims of the paper, they are asked to
include a clearly marked appendix that will be read at the discretion
of the Program Committee.  Abstracts that significantly deviate from
these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.
Abstracts received after the March 17 deadline  WILL NOT BE
CONSIDERED, unless they are postmarked not later than March 13 and
arrive a reasonable time thereafter.  Authors will be informed of
acceptance or rejection in a letter mailed not later than May 26.

A compilation of all abstracts accepted will be available at the
conference.  Authors of accepted papers will be given until July 14,
1989 to submit revised abstracts for this compilation.  Complete
conference proceedings will be published in Springer-Verlag's Lecture
Notes in Computer Science series at a later date.  The Program
Committee will consider abstracts that have also been submitted to
other conferences.  However, if a submission is accepted for
presentation at more than one conference, the authors may present the
results more than once, but may publish them in at most one
proceedings.

The Program Committee consists of
  Josh Benaloh (University of Toronto)
  Russell Brand (Special session chairperson, Lawrence Livermore Laboratory)
  Gilles Brassard (Committee chairperson, Universite de Montreal)
  Claude Crepeau (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)
  Whitfield Diffie (Bell Northern Research)
  Joan Feigenbaum (AT&T Bell Laboratories)
  James Massey (ETH Zentrum, Zurich)
  Jim Omura (Cylink Corporation)
  Gustavus Simmons (Sandia National Laboratories)
  Scott Vanstone (University of Waterloo)

Subj:	[1411] Re: Security equipment

}If you install an alarm
}system... you may be eligible for a discount (on your insurance).

I asked my insurance company about this when I lived in an apartment.
We'd had some burglaries and people were putting up window bars (the
landlord wouldn't )-: ).  They told me there was no insurance discount for
window bars.  A friend (Hi, Marvin!) explained the rationale:

If you have a fire, you generally lose everything and the insurance
company is stuck for the maximum payout.  So, smoke alarms get you a
premium reduction.  Burglars, on the other hand, generally only take a few
items.  The insurance company isn't all that much out of pocket (unless
you're a multi-millionaire with lots of expensive toys to be stolen) and
the relevant premium reduction isn't worth offering.  Bars also hinder
fire fighters.

Except for hindering fire fighters, I'd guess the same logic applies to
alarm systems.  They might save you some inconvenience by scaring away a
burglar, but they generally don't save the insurance company enough for
them to take an interest.

Not that they're a bad idea, mind you.  They just won't save you any
insurance money.

Shadow password files are in theory not required.  In practice, when
someone can read the entire file (and hence all encrypted passwords),
run a password cracking program over it (that allows me to test
candidate passwords at at rate a thousand times faster than simply
attempting to log in), and people pick lousy passwords to begin with,
the assumptions behind the publicly-readable encrypted passwords break
down.  Hence, one would like to move the encrypted passwords to a
place where no one can read them, but otherwise leave the password
file unchanged (so that UNIX still runs fine).

Since I feel that the assumptions behind the current UNIX system are
violated, I disagree with this statement.  I feel that the (shadow
password file) scheme should be considered *mandatory* on a
well-administered UNIX system and the cost is minimal (you need to
change login, passwd, and su, less than a week's work even if you
don't have source).  While subvertable in principle, the shadow
password file scheme is definitely less so than the current system.

Subj:	[793] RE: using RSA Cryptographic Algorithm

In a recent posting, James Galvin solicits implementations of and
experiences with the RSA public key algorithm. Please be aware, folks,
that the RSA algorithm and most of its applications are protected by
a patent held by MIT and licensed to RSA, Inc. While I don't think anyone
could mind if you read the textbooks and implemented your own version
for some private hacking around, any sort of public distribution or
serious use without a license from RSA, Inc. is likely to draw
unfavorable attention from their lawyers.

Don't get me wrong - I've met R & S and they're incredibly nice guys.
But the corporation paid MIT a considerable amount of money for its
license and it's going to get its money's worth. Anyway, the RSA
patent is one of the few that's really worthy of being patented.

Subj:	[1415] Burglar tools

        In this state, trespassing is considered a crime and that crime,
by itself, _can_ sustain a charge of burglary.  This would especially be
true in the case where a search incidental to the arrest produced a set
of lock picks.
        In that situation I would charge with Criminal Trespass, Burglary,
and Possession of Instruments of Crime.  Safe to assume that a plea bargain
would result, the felony charge of Burglary would be dropped and the
deft. would plead guilty to the misdemeanors.  (Unless I forgot to Mirandize
him, which is another issue).

	I would say it would depend on a jury.  If burglar tools (lock picks,
and the like) are in possession, then there _IS_ a presumed intent.  And,
in our state, as I noted earlier, the entrance into a building with intent
to commit _any_ crime constitutes burglary. Therefore, an unlawful entry
into a building while in possession of burglar tools pretty well nails it.

>Consider the *incidental* thief who is also regularly and
>legitimately employed as a carpenter/plumber/construction worker/whatever
>and just happens to carry all these around in his vehicle

	I agree with what you have said in context; but once the tools of the
ligitimate trade have been removed from the vehicle and used to gain access
to a locked building you have another situation.  No luck needed - the
tools become burglar tools ("instruments of crime" per PA Crimes Code).

Subj:	[2004] Re: Hard disk protection

In regards to locking hard disks on IBM type PC's used for student labs,
there are several security packages available for this kind of thing.  At
the University of Connecticut, we have been testing a product called PC/DACS.
(Pyramid Development Corp. 20 Hurlbut St, West Hartford, Ct. 06110).

This product will allow you to create user ID's and profiles similar to a
Mainframe configuration.  There must be at least one security administrator,
who can create new ID's and write resource rules.  A PC can be set up with a
default user ID which gets automatically logged on when the machine is booted
from the C drive.  We use this feature in the labs, where we what the PC to
boot without any user intervention.  The default ID is given read only access
to the entire hard disk.  In one lab, they set it up so that the default ID
has write access to a \TEMP directory so they can keep data for graphics
programs on the hard drive while running the programs.  The /TEMP directory
gets purged at every boot.

There is a boot protect option, which, when activated, will make your hard
drive unrecognizable if you boot from the A drive.  I think it relocates the
FAT, or something insidious like that.  There is also a disk encrypt option
which will scramble your entire hard disk for you, if you're into scrambled
hard disks.  I haven't played with this option, since we really don't need
anything quite that cloak and dagger here.  We are mostly guarding against
accidentally deleted files and cluttered hard disks.

A new feature in the latest release of PC/DACS allows you to write resource
rules for floppy drives as well.  I've been thinking of using this to
disallow the running of programs from floppies.  If it works out, this may be
an acceptable way of limiting the spread of viral programs.

By the way, The State of Connecticut has contracted Pyramid Development Corp.
for the use of PC/DACS in all State agencies.  This is not intended to be an
endorsement of the product, merely a critique.

Subj:	[598] Re: Hard disk protection

One way is to put all 'restricted' programs on one hard disk, or one section
of the hard disk, and simply unmount that section when students are in the
area. This is rather drastic, but the most secure.

Another method: assign group access to the files and place all users who
need to access them inside this group.

One final, and least secure method: (If you are assured to what times
students will have access) set up an 'at' daemon to remove/restore
all permissions to the required files.  NOTE: If you choose this method,
think about the possible login via modem at these times...

Subj:	[1575] A Simple Trick (Re: Dangers of password changes)

Prof. Wheeler mentioned a scheme which is being recommended to customers
of a credit company to securely remember ALL your PINs.  This could be
adopted to remember those passwords a user has to change periodically.

The trick is simply as this:  suppose you want to remember your PIN for
VISA card which is 1234 and that for ACCESS card which is 3456 and that
for Diners which is 7890.

1) Write down A to Z and choose a word (gray, for example).
2) Write down your PINs in such a way that each PIN is on a separate line
   and the 4 digits are under the four letters g, r, a, y.  Leave other
   places blank.

          A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
  VISA    3           1                     2             4
  ACCESS  5           3                     4             6
  Diners  9           7                     8             0

3) Fill in all blank spaces with random digits.

Now the task to remember a number of passwords is reduced to remember an
easy word.  Also, this list can be made public with virtually no loss in
security ( although try to keep it secret).  There are many variations, for
example to allow repeated letters in a word.  Well, then what ?

Subj:	[937] Re: Hard disk protection

Somebody did something like this at our place. I don't know what they did, but
here is my suggestion of how I would do it: I would write a program that would
write protect all directories. I know that I could use something like Xtree to
do this, but I think that a program will give me more flexibility. I could for
example make it leave some directories writeable (scratch files). I would also
think of putting the unprotected files in their own partition (drive) on the
hard-disk. E.g. dirve C protected and drive D unprotected and in addition
perhaps make D small. I would also write a program that would unprotect a drive
(for maintenance). These programs would probably make a nice little student
project (or assignment). Lastly I would get a program that would reformat the
drive without destroying the data. I've heard that one should do a low level
format on a hard drive once every 6 to 12 months. I hope this sounds sensible.

     There are a number of products that are designed to do the sort of
     thing that you're looking for.  I've tried Pyramid's PC/DACS (Data
     Access Control System), and it works pretty well if you install all
     of the options (hard disk boot protection AND disk encryption).
     You can set up individual users, with each one having access to
     whatever directories and files that you choose.  With the encryption
     installed, it seems rather thorough; without it, it's child's play
     to get around.  Of course, the encryption adds a bit of overhead to
     disk activities, but it's pretty reasonable.  Pyramid Development
     Corp. can be reached at (203)-524-9832.

     I have no connection with Pyramid other than being a satisfied

What kind of machine are we talking about here?  Mac, IBM, etc...

On the Mac, it's relatively easy to do -- just set the FILE PROTECT bit in
the files that you don't want duplicated or moved (although it will let you
TRASH them I think...).  A utility such as MacSnoop, or FEdit will usually
do the job (I know RESEDIT wont let ya....)

As for a PC, well, you could set the HIDDEN bit on them to true so they
dont show up in the directory, and then have a batch file call em...This
ought to work (but seeing as how I use Macs, and rarely get on PC's...it
might not...)  Although I have had hidden directories, with the files
showing and had batch files like that....

Hope this helps...

"Out of band" signalling is great, assuming that you have an out of
band path.  If you're one of the enlightened (:-) Emacs users,
"obscure" sequences that "no one will ever type" are ordinary command
sequences.

Another important question is "where is the trusted path TO?"  In the
olden days when all terminals were hardwired to serial ports, you
could follow a wire and know where it went.  In the current trend
towards Ethernet terminal servers, my wire goes to that box.  A
trusted path could only be guaranteed to that box, not to the host (at
least until we improve the network protocols).

Unfortunately, the current situation leads to the operating assumption
that you don't have a trusted path.  "Don't worry, be suspicious," is
thus the motto of the day.

In fact, according to published reports the Computer Virus Industry

therefore postulates a cost of $16,700 per machine.  We had around

Glad to hear that steam-tunnel exploration was common at many different

particular student subculture that enjoys such things. Myself, I was
a charter member of the "WUASS" - Washington University Artificial 
Spelunkers Society -- back in '63-'67 at Wash U in St. Louis. There were
about 6 of us in that group. There may have been others doing it during
the same timeframe, but we never ran into them. I'm sure people did it
in the decades before we discovered the pastime, but they left no
records that we knew of, either written or in verbal folk culture. I
wouldn't be surprised if the activity stopped after we graduated, simply
because that later period was one of campus unrest (building-burning,
etc.) which would have led to tighter security that might have cut off
the relatively easy tunnel access we enjoyed. Things might have loosened
up again in the 70's and early 80's, though.

Subj:	[685] Re: Friction is your friend

There is some name confusion going on here.

We use both Cypher locks and Simplex locks in our stores.  You're right
about the (lack of) security of a Cypher lock -- I was trying to work in
a store after the last person who knew the combination had left, and
I had it open in under three minutes (using only a flashlight).

The Simplex locks can be much more secure from the viewpoint of 'breaking'
the combination, but seem to be physically weaker IMHO.  Also, with the
Simplex locks, visual surveillance of the combination can be a problem.
And they can be defeated by the oldest trick in the book -- sales
consultants who tape the locks open because they 'get in the way'. :-)

Hobbit is right.  Cipher locks are as he described.  Five rocker switches
run to a box usually above and inside the door.  You can program a 4 digit
sequence in them by these little patchcords inside the box.  Simplex locks
are purely mechanical which are programmed by opening them, putting in the
old combination, pushing a plunger, entering the new combination, and then
clearing it.

BRL never had any Cipher locks that I knew about, only Simplex.  The Simplex
weren't really regarded as any more secure than the plain old Seargent key
locks, key distribution was easier.  Generally they were used for things like
printout rooms and labs where they were used by a large class of people.
The secure facilities were actually deadbolted and alarmed when not attended.
Even when we used Cipher locks in the SCIF's at other jobs, they were used
only when the room was attended inside anyhow.  At night we turned on the
alarm and spun the big ol' S&G lock on the door.

What was amazing to me is the number of people who never bother to change
the Simplex locks from the 2-4, 3 combo they all get shipped with.

Subj:	[1051] Re: Additional security to login

The /dev/passwd could be made write-only. (well, write and compare
only.) If it were implemented properly in hardware it could emulate
what the Unix one-way encryption is trying to do. In fact it wouldn't
need to store the passwords in encrypted form if you could trust the
hardware.  It would just need to answer a request of the form: "Is this
uid/password combination valid?" Presumably it would have some built-in
delay and maybe an alarm it could ring if too many invalid attempts
were made in a short time.

	... would no doubt be subject to its own special class of
	attacks.

Well, the only weakness I can see here (other than a hardware attack,
in which case all bets are off anyway) is if someone emulates root and
changes someone else's password, which can be done in "standard" Unix
already. In fact, the /dev/passwd thingy would be slightly better
against even this attack, because the cracker wouldn't be able to
restore the old password to clean up after the fact.

Subj:	[1209] Re: Zero knowledge passwords?

On the subject of reverse authentication (proving to the user that they
are talking to the system), something like the Security Dynamics SecurID
card can provide this.  A displayed number on the card changes every so
many seconds; to authenticate you simply type in the current number and
the system can authenticate you since it is time synced.  By then
requiring the system to provide the NEXT number, you can compare it with
the next one on your card, thus being assured you are talking to the
actual system.

If the Racal-Guardata product would simply allow the response from one
challenge to become another challenge (rather than forcing a random
challenge), then I think it also could provide reverse authentication.
System issues challenge, you type response.  Then your card calculates a
response from that response, which the system must also do, thus proving
who it is.  Since each challenge/response is unique, this seems immune
to replay and as safe as the original challenge/response was.

According to conversations I had last fall with Bob Oechsler,

They may have been responsible for several calamities, including
the destruction of millions of fish, the irreparable damage to
the piers of a new bridge which has now been permanently closed,
and the explosion of a Cessna 182 as it flew over one of the
barges.  The pilot of the Cessna was killed.  His family hired
a salvage firm to dredge for the remains of the airplane, but
no debris was ever found.

When I spoke to him, Oechsler was pressing for Congressional

Subj:	[1557] Password Length versus Duration

Glenn is right in that password length and lifetime can probably be traded back
and forth holding some metric of security constant.  If one of my users
complains about our relatively long password lifetimes I offer them a double
for double deal on their password:

	twice the lifetime for twice the minimum length.

Glenn is raising an interesting human interface issue when he disparages VMS's
password set of {A-Z0-9$_}*36 for not including random punctuation since the
space of possible inputs is about the right size (informationally speaking) to
collapse into an 8 byte hashed password.  [Various studies I have seen quoted
assert that english text has 2-4 bits of real information content bet letter
because of its high redundancy.  A good citation would be appreciated.]

This more realistic than the otherwise plausible idea of taking eight ASCII
characters typed in at a terminal.  Most terminals require contortions or
surgery to generate many of the possible characters and thus most passwords
will fall in a very restricted portion of the possible space.

[Still a large one but not as large as possible or even I would contend
desirable.]

Is it is better to ask for fewer characters from a wider range or more
characters that people are likely to enter?

That sounds like an interesting problem for some student in a human factors
program to consider.

The question of how many characters people can type without visual feedback and
maintain a low error rate also enters into it.  All in all I am suprised
someone hasn't done a thesis on it.

Subj:	[6407] Virus Technical Review

  This request has appeared on the bitnet virus-l mailing list, and has
  been crossposted to the appropriate comp.sys groups and to comp.risks.
  I apologise for any readers who receive duplicate copies.

       -------------------------------------------------------------
       A review of the threat posed to the security and integrity of
       microcomputer systems posed by self-replicating code segments
       -------------------------------------------------------------

I am in the process of compiling information on existing computer viruses,
with a view to the production of a technical paper reviewing the threat
to system security posed by both present computer viruses and likely
future developments.

To this end I would be very grateful for information on individual
infections, preferably detailing the symptoms observed, damage caused and
disinfection techniques applied. Naturally I am also interested in details
of the operation of the viruses, although I appreciate the reticence shown
by infected parties to disseminate any details of virus operation, on the
basis that it could lead to development of further viruses.

The technical report is part of a Doctoral research thesis in computer
security, and will be available in late May. Distribution of the technical
report will be restricted to people who have a legitimate interest
(ie systems managers, commercial concerns, research), as I expect to
review the techniques exploited by viruses in a fair degree of detail at
the BIOS/DOS interface level. The report will consider the techniques used by
virus to duplicate, the ways in which viruses gain control of the computer
system, the camouflage techniques adopted and a brief overview of the
existing computer viruses. Finally the report will consider the likely
development of the threat from viruses, and how this developing threat
can be addressed by protective software in both virtual and non-virtual
machine operating environments.

At the moment I know of the following viruses:

IBM PC MS/DOS 
1. Lehigh variant 1 and 2              2. New Zealand (stoned)
3. Vienna (Austrian, 648)              4. Blackjack (1701, 1704)
5. Italian (Ping Pong)                 6. Israeli variant 1 (Friday 13th, 1813,
                                          PLO, Jerusalem), variant 2, variant 3
                                          (April 1st), variant 4
7. Brain (Pakastani) and variants      8. Yale

Also potentially variant of the Rush Hour and VirDem viruses developed 
during the CCC's work on viruses.

APPLE MAC
1. NVir variant A and B, Hpat           2. Scores
3. INIT 29                              4. ANTI
5. Peace (MacMag)

APPLE II
1. Elk 

AMIGA
1. SCA                                  2. Byte Bandit
3. IRQ

ATARI ST
1. Boot sector                          2. Virus construction set viruses

Mainframe OS worms
1. Internet worm                        2. DECNET worm
2. BITNET Xmas chain letter

I would be grateful for any information on these, or any other viruses. 
Reports of infection may be given in confidence, in which case they will
only be used as an indication of geographical distribution of infection.

A summary of known viruses, their symptoms, geographic distribution and
known disinfection measures will be posted to the list as soon as 
sufficient information is available to prepare an interim report. 

As part of the paper I will also be reviewing the effectiveness of viral
disinfection software, and would thus be interested in details of any
software you use, its effectiveness, and availability.

Thanks for your time!

Actually one problem with the Medecos is that within a given master
key system (typically a building), all of the pin rotations are the
same for all of the changes.  If you have the lowest key to, say the
garbage room, you know the pin rotations to the grandmaster key which
opens all doors.  Because of this, the Medecos are only marginally
better than other precision locks at preventing the usual university
problem, which is a student adding a little solder to his office/dorm key
and using a file to turn it into a master key.

It probably belongs in RISKS, but I can't help commenting that when
the Biaxials first came out, the Medeco keying software had some
problems with cross-keying, with the result that one of our office
keys was also a submaster for a different series....that student had fun!

Subj:	[3086] Re: Simplex locks

Some time ago I computed 1152 (as I recall) as the number of possible
combinations -- not exactly what is implied by the "thousands of
possible combinations" claimed by the Simplex folks (recently I saw
some blurb that claimed "more than 2000" combinations).

Incidentally, if (through psychoanalysis of the user) you suspect a
"complex" combination involving 3 buttons simultaneously, your guessing
job is greatly reduced.  There are only 10 such 3-button sets, each with
only 2 other buttons to consider.

There IS a way to generate some additional combinations, although it
violates the instructions of the manufacturer to "remove your fingers
from the buttons before turning the knob," risking damage to the lock if
you're not careful when opening it.  At the end of the sequence, an
otherwise unused button can be pressed lightly, just to the point of
increased resistance, and HELD THERE as the knob is turned.  Such a
combination is distinct both from pressing the button all the way and
from not pressing the button at all.  The basic principles for
setting/changing such combinations still apply: set the combination
using the same actions you're going to use to open the lock; to change
the combination, press the present combination and, while holding the
final button(s) activate the "change" slide.

It is possible to detect such combinations through manipulation and
determine the buttons involved, but such combinations would confound
the unaware.

It never ceases to amaze me the way these very useful locks are
mis-applied (largely due to mis-information supplied by the
manufacturer).  The locks are primarily suited (at least in my mind) to
preventing casual entry to a restricted area, provided that the location
of the lock is such that anyone attempting manipulation would be
immediately observed and challenged.

	-*-		-*-		-*-

Now that I have located the papers with my old calculations, I find that
the actual number of combinations for a Simplex lock is 1082 (even worse
than the 1152 I remembered).

Just for kicks, I calculated the effect of the "trick" I mentioned
(lightly pressing some of the unused buttons and holding them while
turning the knob).  There are a total of 2163 combinations if you allow
this.  Perhaps this is what the manufacturer had in mind when claiming
"greater than 2000" combinations, but the operating instructions
expressly forbid doing this.

What puzzles me is why the lock wasn't made with 6 buttons instead of 5.
The number of combinations then rises to over a million (without
"tricks") and security against manipulation is also improved, at least
for combinations that use all the buttons.

[Moderator add-on: The above-mentioned "trick" is Simplex's "high-security-
mode", which in theory they only point out to their high-muckymuck military
customers.  Years ago at a locksmith show I had one of the Simplex reps set
"some random combo" on one of their demos to see if I could open it; he used
one of these and I couldn't get it open at the time, although I rolled out of
bed with the answer the next morning...    _H*]

Subj:	[831] On DES' "breakability"

It has often been said that DES *could* be broken by brute-force using
lots of Cray-2 time and so on, and that the NSA caused the DES' key to
be just short enough that they could break it but nobody else could.
It appears now that such networks of workstations, fiddling in their
"spare time" might also be able to pull off the same trick.  Having not
studied the DES in great detail yet, how easy is it to increase the key
to 64 bits or more?  Do the key scheduling tables need lots of work to
derive?  I heard once that the research behind parts of the algorithm
were still classified.

RSA keeps sounding better and better, if it could only be made reasonably
quick.  T. Okamoto proposed a much faster method that unfortunately results
in ciphertext much larger than the plaintext (3:1);  has this method been
discredited yet?

Subj:	[3225] RE:  Burglar Invitations

I suppose the following possibilities exist regarding lost keys --

  1.  Permanently lost.  In a field, down a rain gutter, dropped in
      curing cement, accidentally thrown out with the trash.  Obviously
      no concern about how they're marked.
  2.  Lost, then found by an honest person who returns them.
  3.  Lost, found by an honest person who decides calling is too much
      bother, or that mailing them to the address is too much bother.
      Finder throws them away.
  4.  Lost, found by a dishonest person who would like to burgle you
      but is put off by the lack of a usable address.
  5.  Lost, found by a dishonest person who is both clever and intent
      on using the key(s).

That last, and probably least likely, is what worries me.  Given just phone
number, what can be done?

  1.  Sequential search of the phone book.  Not too likely, even here in
      Laramie  :-)
  2.  Call Phone company and trick them into giving customer name and
      address, or just even name.  I've heard varying stories on this such
      as claiming you got billed for a long-distance call to that number
      and wanting to know name & address to jog your memory before really
      getting angry at the company; or posing as a telco employee who needs
      address to work on the line.  Bribes might work well too if you know
      the right people.  Telling the truth might even work ("I found this
      key with the number...").
  3.  There may be on-line ways to get this info, legitimately or otherwise.
  4.  There may be published cross-references (or maybe I'm thinking of street
      number back to name).
  5.  Call the phone number and ask for a street address so a free trip to
      Las Vegas can be awarded (YOU may not fall for this, especially if you
      KNOW you recently lost your key, but what about your 13-year old son?)
      Variations include long-lost cousins, and so on.

Clearly, using a work number as described reduces possibilities.  However,
some companies may be more lax about giving out phone information or lists
than THE phone company, and the list may be small enough to make a sequential
search feasible.

Given just a PO box number --

  1.  Walk up to box, peek in window (if windowed) to try and find a readable
      name.  Go to phone book.  Even if you have an unlisted number or use
      your PO box in the phone book, there are other publications in the
      county library that may list your name and address given name.  County
      records might also be a source.
  2.  Get the street address from the window jockey (may involve fast talk
      and/or bribe).  I had to give this when I got my box in the first place.
      I don't know what the rules are on the USPS giving out this info or what
      they want it for in the first place.

The only really safe thing to do is mark keys with somebody else's identity
such as a trusted friend or a security service bureau.  Or don't mark them,
and if you lose one, either don't worry or re-key.

Disclaimer -- I do not mean to imply that USPS or telco employees accept
bribes, or to defame them in any way.  Just considering possibilities, and
you have to admit it must happen even if only infrequently.

Subj:	[1927] Question on block ciphers

I have been reading up on DES and RSA encryption.  I have a question that
may or may not point out my ability to read  :-)

Let's take public-key encryption as typified by RSA.  It is a "block" cypher
in that any large message must be broken into a set of small pieces, then
each piece is separately encrypted.  For example if you have a 200-digit
key, each piece should be no larger than 200 digits.  Let's say I want to
send the message --

     DO NOT    (block 0)
     DELETE    (block 1)
     FILE 1    (block 2)

If I encrypt these and send them to the destination, but the first block
simply gets lost, the resulting message is quite different!  An active
eavesdropper will not be able to decypt them, but if he wants to be
mischevious (at the expense of possibly exposing himself) he could,
knowing my block length (after all the key is public), just drop a block.
Likewise, upon gathering several messages I've signed, he could mix and
match blocks, and end up with something that I have "provably" signed
(since each block was signed) but is gibberish or by bad luck damaging.
The latter is possible because he has access to both the ciphertext and
plain text (by decrypting using my public key) and could "cut and paste"
previously received encypted blocks.  Unless I'm reading things wrong,
RSA can only prove you signed a block, not the entire document.

Am I missing something in the algorithm, that "binds" blocks in some way
to prevent this, or is there an underlying assumption that external
means will be taken to glue the blocks in some way?  Clearly you could
include block numbers inside each block to ensure block sequence and
reception of all blocks, but this does not solve the issue of authentication
of signed messages (which could still be cut-and-pasted), and it adds more
overhead (though cheap overhead for RSA where blocks are large, this is
bad news for DES where the blocks are only 64 bits).

Subj:	[591] Shrink wrap not safe- yet another virus story

Do not believe that shrink wrap is the safest way to go to avoid
viral infection.  In the last week, we have been hit by two garden
variety nVIR viri.  Both came from reputable companies.  In fact, one
came on the distribution disks for our Texas Instruments MicroExplorer.
TI phoned us about it, and sent  a virus remedy however.

I can control what software I get from other people that I know, but it
seems to me that I can't control, or even find out what precautions were

Subj:	[2646] Re: "Viri Logicum"

>How can one defend against a virus unless they have one to look at?

Yes there are very legit reasons for writing worms.

You see the problem is that the biological analogy has overpowered your
understanding of some of these programs.  That is all they are, programs.
At one time writing compilers and operating systems had a mystic "above"
other programs.  Then it was learned mere morals could do them (well,
more mortals at least).  This is even less so with worms and viruses
which are much simpler.

These programs are destructive in some way only because of intent.
Programs of this structure can be found in system daemons, and they
will become more prevalent as we increase our use of networks,
distributed systems, remote servers, multiprocessors, and so on.

The seeds of these issues could be found on Schoch et al's CACM paper on
Worm Programs.  When they were testing on the Xerox research net,
were they stealing other people's evening cycles?  Its gets worse.
The problem is sort of like the popularity of the old TV show:
Mission Impossible.  They did neat things technically, but no one
questioned whether they were doing legal or right things.  The show went
out of fashion during Watergate, perhaps during a fit of conscience.
But now in the days of Lt. Col. Ollie North, the show reappears.
The same sort of goes with computer security.

Proposed laws are written by people who do not completely understand
these issues.  Security experts don't completely understand.  It's
interesting to note how many "experts" can't write a simple Trojan horse
shell script.

Remember they are just programs.  Their harm is subject to human
intepretation, and machines will have an even harder time discriminating.
Will virus killing programs kill daemons by mistake?

One last note: a short story.  I work on some machines which are very fast.
During the testing of one, I had a script of a workload which "got away."
The point was to run continuously by forking a new child and dying.
I tried killing it, but before I could, it always forked.  This happened
about 2 weeks before Morris.  The initial shock (panic) hit me: multi-million
dollar machine running amuck.  If Morris did accidnetly lose his program,
I think I know how he felt.  I was at least able to kill mine.

Well, sure, if you're using micros as terminals, and the micros are
publicly accessible or shared, then there are all kinds of possibilities
for security cracking.

In our environment the users who use public terminals seem to like the
personalized password prompts, both for security and because they can be cute.
All we claim for them is that they will sometimes defeat the most
simple-minded password grabber programs; and that was the kind we tended to
see often in the past.  Now the method of attack has shifted to modern
high-performance password guessing programs.

         The book costs $20.00, which is supposed to include mailing expenses,
         with checks payable to Advanced Software Protection.

      2) Recently, Abacus publishing has released a book which is causing
         some disturbance among the computer virus "authorities";
         the book is entitled "Computer Viruses - A High-Tech Disease".
         This book gets extremely detailed whith actual code for various

Subj:	[959] "Entering" by daemons

The discussion about networks, distributed security, etc. 
brings up several issues.  The issues are similar to the software
licensing issue of program generators (like YACC).  If programs
execute programs which perform "irresponsible" acts, who is responsible?
If daemons (written intentionally, obviously) do destructive acts,
can increasing levels of indirection eliminate responsibility?

The issue raised by program generators and licenses was who owns
the generated program.  The issue of daemons and program generators
and security is whether continued abstraction will become a problem.

MEET MISS ANNIE DROID

By Hassell Bradley

    Denver (FNS) -- Don't look now, but that snazzy looking mannequin over
there may be watching you -- and eavesdropping too.  With a camera in her
eye and a microphone up her nose, Anne Droid is the latest weapon in the
growing arsenal of antishoplifting technology.

    Jerry Gutierrez, who owns Anne Droid Mannequins, a nationally known
mannequin repair firm here, has developed a surveillance system that shoots
videotape through a mannequin's eye and ties in to closed circuit TV
networks.

    Besides its potential for spying on thieving shoppers or employees, the
system also could be used to record customers' reactions to new products.
According to Gutierrez, it fits into any type or size of mannequin head
-- infant or adult -- as long as there is an eye opening of one-half inch.
    In the past two years Gutierrez has perfected Annie, named his company
Anne Droid (he credits "Start Trek" with inspiring the name) and initiated
patent proceedings.

    Although he manufactures mannequins himself, Gutierrez designed the
surveillance system to fit just about any style mannequin a visual
merchandiser wants.

    Gutierrez manufactures the various glass and metal fittings for his
surveillance system.  They include a special camera carriage, acrylic
eyeballs through which the video camera films, special tubes, and contact
lenses.

    "I went to an optometrist and had a prescription written out for exactly
what I wanted for the eyeball," he said.  "Then I went to a lens cutter and
had him grind the lenses for me.  But I soon learned to do that for myself."

    The camera has automatic iris control and automatic focusing, so every-
thing is in focus within a range of lights and distances.  Once Annie is
installed inside a mannequin, the result is a fixed, closed circuit TV
camera that shoots only in black and white.

    Gutierrez said he's received a positive reception from the stores he's
shown the system to, but none have bought it yet.

    Peter Berlin, who runs a shrinkage consulting firm in Jericho, N.Y.,
was skeptical.  "I want people to know that we have cameras," he pointed out.
"I want to prevent theft, not detect it.  I want a camera capable of shooting
in more than one place at a time."

    Gutierrez maintained this device is intended to keep watch over specific,
troublesome areas that the sweep cameras may be missing.  "Anne Droid is not
meant to be a full system," he noted.  "It's meant to enhance dead spots
-- for example, if you want to watch a particular cash register."
 
    The system shoots videotape in real time and can be hooked up with most
VCRs, Gutierrez said.  He suggested, however, that it be used with surveil-
lance systems, which normally use time-lapse VCRs.

    The microphone, which is part of the camera, has a range of about 10
feet, depending upon background noise.

    "Most people believe, and they are correct, that it is illegal to record
a private conversation.  However, when a conversation takes place in a public
setting, it can no longer be deemed private.  Annie makes it possible for
retailers to listen to customers discuss new products or services a store
offers.  Annie could be installed in dressing rooms, or at counters.
And she would be ideal at trade shows."

    Gutierrez also can install Annie "blind:" (sic) After employees see
certain mannequins have cameras in them, he can make all the mannequins look
as though they too contain the system.

    Basic price, including the camera, four-inch monitor and 66 feet of
cable, runs between $1100 and $1200.  Including a Decter, Co. mannequin,
it would be $1800.  The cable length can be extended to 198 feet, but coaxial
cable must be used if the cable has to be any longer.  Annie hooks up to most
closed circuit TV systems.

Subj:	[2219] Re: Hard disk protection

Remember on a PC unless there is hardware with a lock&key any one can still do
anything they want. This software will certainly slow people down but I
wouldn't trust it any more than a mainframe with public access. Even if DOS
doesn't recognize the hard drive it is still possible to write software to
access any section of the hard drive. The Encryption option may provide some
more protection but I have seen programs that will let you crack DES
encryption in about 30 minutes. 

Suppose this system has a UNIX like password file and you have just failed a
course and your grades are on this system.... Reading data from the hard drive
while not easy isn't that difficult. You happen to have an account on the
machine so you setup a large file with known contents, and take out your DES
cracker. 30 minutes later you have the encryption key, search the hard drive
for the password file change the system administrator password to nothing.
Login and pass the course.... Actually breaking into the system would take
some work but what if the person just wanted to erase the hard drive? Then it
is only necessary to write a lots of garbage data onto it. Unless the PC is
behind locked doors I wouldn't trust anything important to this system. 

Now for something completely different...

At least this isn't as bad as FAX documents being legally binding, I wonder how
long it will take for some one to realize they can undetectably forge legally
binding documents? Lets say you have just failed a course and you feel like
getting back at the "evil" prof? Fortunitly your father law firm (Leech and
son ambulance chasers) happens to have a board for there computer to transmit
fax documents. You find all the paper work the FBI would fax to your local
police department to have a child molester arrested, cut and paste a bit and
fax it down to the police station. Since phone calls don't tell where they are
coming from they will not realize that the documents are bogus until they
deliver the "child molester" to the FBI. And they will never be able to find
out who faxed them the documents.

How many seconds?  Does this rely upon a chip in the card keeping time accurate

so, it better be more accurate than my digital watch -  and that's a good one.
I wouldn't trust it near the edges of its time spans.  I don't see how else it

     DES only has a 56 bit key - not 64 bit, which a number of people
feel does not give sufficient security.  It is possible to develop a
system similar to DES with more bits, which the original
implementation had.  If more security is desired, the data could be
double encrypted with two DES boxes with different keys in series
(somehow my gut feeling does not like this), or with two DES boxes in
parallel (e.g. one does the odd bits and the other the even bits).
Assuming there are no trapdoors in DES, this would give a 112 bit key
encryption without having to develop a new algorithm.

 -	For a 27 letter equiprobable alphabet (A-Z,space) with no inter

 -	If the probabilities of the symbols are included, ie ETAOIN....

 -	If each letter depends only on the previous symbol, we

	approximately 3.1 bits/symbol.
 -	If the dependence is on all the preceding text, it is between

Subj:	[879] Re: Question on block ciphers

For the reasons that you name, and others as well, block ciphers are
not normally used straight.  What you want to look into are the DES
modes of operation; they're in FIPS 81, or ANSI X3.106.  There are other,
non-standard, modes as well.

For message-at-a-time operation, many people use ``cipher block chaining''.
It involves exclusive or-ing each input block with the output of the
previous step before encrypting.  That is, if C[i] is the ciphertext
from encrypting P[i], each step looks like this:

	C[i] = E(P[i] ^ C[i-1])

Decryption is the reverse:

	P[i] = D(C[i]) ^ C[i-1]

An initial value IV is used to start things off for block 1 when there is
no C[0].

There is still some chance of cut&paste here; refer to any standard work
on cryptography for details of the properties of this and other modes.
I suggest Davies and Price's ``Security for Computer Networks''.

If NSA can indeed break DES, it's because they know more about cryptanalysis,

This is a very important point that deserves reemphasis.
There is NO practical way to tell the difference between
a legitimate utility program and a virus program.  If the
system privileges permit certain operations and my program
performs those operations, it might be for a legitimiate
function or it might be that I am maliciously exploiting
a loophole in the system protection rules.  It may even
be in the shadowy area in-between, for example if I remove
a huge scratch file that is keeping my application from
getting enough disk space to perform its job.  Should I be
removing the scratch file or not?  That's a matter of local
system administrative policy.  So far as system security is
concerned, if the system permits it then it is legitimate.

There are two things that can go wrong.  A perfectly secure
system can be misadministered, so that users are given more
capabilities than intended.  Or, the system security rules
and implementation may have inadvertent loopholes.  The
combination of both factors was involved in the Internet
worm incident.

Automatic "virus killers" are completely misguided.  If you
know enough to identify inadvertent security loopholes or
errors in system administration, you should be in a position
to get them fixed.  If your virus killer acts on any other
grounds, then it will interfere with perfectly legitimate
applications.

RSA provides authentication when the blocks are enciphered with the private

There is common technique for getting both authentication and
confidentiality of messages longer than the "block size" (200 digits in
your example).  First, encipher the message in a traditional block chaining
cipher (like DES CBC).  Then, take the key and IV used to encipher the
message and encipher them twice with RSA -- once with the private key of
the originator and once with the public key of the recipient.  This give
authentication and confidentiality of the entire message.

The DARPA privacy-enhanced electronic mail (RFC 1040) uses this scheme.

Yes, you are missing something, but it is not in the DES Standard. 
DES is a "block" cipher, i.e., it is designed to encode 64 bit     
blocks.  Of course, the world is not made up of convenient 64 bit  
blocks, so there is another standard that describes the safe ways  
to compose it into mechanisms for messages of arbitrary length.    
Most of these add so much complexity as to be more secure than the 
DES primitive.

It is easy to achieve any effective key length that you desire.  IBM

crypto engine to achieve an effective key length of 112 bits.       
(Three encryption steps are used in such a way that if the key is   
chosen with 56 bits repeated twice, then steps 1 and 2 cancel each  
other out.  This permits compatability with the standard 56 bit     
software implementation.)

The first step of DES encryption is to convert the 56-bit key into 16
48-bit subkeys.  This step is done by a series of shifts (rotates, really)
and permutations.  Presumably, other algorithms could be used to expand
any reasonably-short key to 768 bits, or one could even specify a 768-bit
key directly.  I've seen something of the sort proposed in Cryptologia,
but I'm not qualified to evaluate the merits of the proposal.  Certainly,
there are weaknesses to be avoided; for example, if all 16 subkeys are
the same, the algorithm is much easier to crack.  There are other patterns
even in standard DES that can give rise to undesirable subkey structures

The controversial section is the S-box.  It's undisputed that (a) NSA changed
it; (b) there are regularities in it; (c) NSA has admitted to some of the
design principles; and (d) no one has yet (publicly) found any way to use
any of these quirks.  It may even be true that these changes make DES
stronger.  Meyer and Matyas (in ``Cryptography:  A New Dimension in Computer
Data Security'') note that random S-boxes take fewer logic elements to
implement than do the standard one, when expressed as the sum of Boolean
minterms.  They conjecture that this is significant.  (Note:  Meyer and
Matas work for the group at IBM that designed DES in the first place.
This may or may not make them credible; it does speak well of their
knowledge.)

Yeah: a couple of things come to mind wrt unchanged combinations.  My

If you lost your card (or when you left) they just changed the combo
and issued a new pair of "keys".  At one point they had difficulty, so
the maid came and unlocked their room with the master key.  You could tell
it was the master key because it had ALL its holes punched.

In a similar vein, in "Surely your joking Mr Feynmann", Richard Feynmann

a super-strong secure safe installed by a Brass-Hat.  When the safe was

            TV TECHNOLOGY MAY KEEP CARS SAFER FROM THIEVES
  
   Looking for a better car security system?  Take another look at your TV.
   Using the same technology that sharpens TV images, GTE Corp. scientists 
   have up with a new theft-proof locking system.  The device uses the
   properties of SAW -- surface acoustic waves -- to activate a tiny coil
   embedded in a car key.  As the key turns to open the door or start the
   engine, the coil sends out a coded digital signal needed to unlock or 
   start the car.  GTE makes similar SAW filters to lock in color TV tuners 
   on each channel.

   GTE's auto-lock system, called SAFE for surface acoustic filter encoding, 
   has the advantage of being completely passive:  There are no codes to
   memorize or alarms to disarm.  And unlike other antitheft locks, SAFE 
   needs no electrical contact -- or even teeth on the key.  Eventually, 
   keys for individual drivers could be encoded to automatically adjust 
   the seats and mirrors.  So far, GTE has gotten "a strong response" in
   Detroit, says Scott L. Atkinson, marketing specialist with GTE's Elec-
   tronic Components & Materials Div., who thinks auto makers may offer
   SAFE within two years.  Also eyeing the system, says Atkinson, are 
   foreign carmakers and major U.S. car insurers, who are battling $6 
   billion a year in U.S. car-theft losses.

No, there's no known algorithm.

Oh, you want more?  Neglecting the salt for the moment, password-hashing
is done by repeatedly encrypting a constant string with the user's
password as the key.  The encryption algorithm used is DES.  Deducing
the password is therefore the same as the following:  given a known
plaintext (the constant), and a known ciphertext, find the key.  This
is equivalent to cracking DES, which has not been demonstrated to be
possible, at least to those of us who don't work for the NSA, the KGB,
or equivalent.  And, given that the encryption is repeated many times
(just to slow things down), the problem is harder yet.  Finally, even if
NSA can crack DES -- and that seems not improbable -- it's quite likely
that they require much more plaintext than 8 bytes.  (Unless, of course,
the S-box is really a trapdoor function, to which they have the matching
key.)

Two caveats.  First, the set of ASCII password doesn't come close to
exhausting the DES key space.  It isn't clear to me how much of a difference
that makes, since all bits in the key are settable.  Second, the password
hash salt function permutes the E-box; there has been evidence presented that
this weakens the encryption somewhat.  I have no idea if that would help
cryptanalysis in a practical sense, especially given the limited plaintext
available.

Yes.  Lifetime is also specified at ordering time.  I think that 2
years is the limit.  As many hosts are set to "watch time," the
validation software incorporates the obvious slew tracking features
that would be necessary.  Thus, the internal clock must be good, but
not incredibly so.

This is a strong statement.  If true, it has enormous ramifications
for cryptography as many encryption systems are built around DES.

I have some questions:

1) Do you have direct (first hand knowledge through actual use) or
indirect (a friend that...) knowledge of this program?

2) Is the program attacking true DES or some PC software companies
"proprietary 'uncrackable'" scheme?

3) Does the attack work through chosen plaintext, plaintext, or
ciphertext only?

4) What are the hardware/time requirements?  (I.e., is the 30 minutes
on an IBM P.C. or a bank of 100 CRAY-2s...)

5) When was the program written?  By whom?  At where?

6) Was the program based on published research?  If so, I would like a
citation.

7) How does the attack work?  (Just a general idea, I'm not asking for
code.)

To the best of my understanding, as stated in a few books I've read (the
titles escape me) the algorithm unix uses to encrypt passwords is irreversable,
letters being changed according to previous letters before change. Also,
the fact that ALL encryptions yield 13 characters (actually, 11 characters
and a two character key) seem to suggest this.

There are several companies that market the SmartCard ID technology.
I'm reasonably familiar with SecureID from Security Dynamics, Inc.
The change rate is selectable (by the vendor).
 
This technology does *NOT* depend on the card keeping super-accurate
time over an extended span.  The HOST keeps a range of access keys
(nominally the current key (based on the system clock), the last ten
keys, and the next ten keys) and resync's itself (via a drift fudge-
factor) every time that user ID's him/herself.  Drift becomes a problem
only when a user vanishes for an extended period.
 
NOTE:  While one might be concerned about allowing the key to vary
over a "spread", there are checks to notify "responsible persons" if
the drift starts wandering too much.

Gwynn@brl.mil says that if NSA can break DES it's because they know more about
cryptanalysis.  This seems to contradict the fact (found by congressional
investigation) that NSA did indeed influence the decision to use 56 bits
instead of 64 or more for the key.  If increasing the key size is not
necessarily an effective countermeasure, why did they do that?  And if they
can break DES by cryptanalysis, why do they have God-knows-how-many gigaflops
of compute power?

I do admit they probably know more about cryptanalysis than the average guy,
and they probably have other uses for their computers than brute-forcing DES
texts.  But in view of their involvement with the key size, there is a strong
implication that key size is important.  They probably use both their expertise
as well as compute power to do their job, whatever that is.

As mentioned, you can make two (or more) passes through the DES
for additional security. Dons 'gut feeling' about this maybe not being
a good idea pertains I am sure to the possibility of patterns 
forming from the multiple runs through the data; this is possible
with a lot of crypto systems, and I would not be suprised if it
was the case with DES.

Note that knowing how many passes were made, and with what key
length (another GREAT variable you can use) is very important. It is not
easy to break things when you have no idea how many passes were made,
and what the key lengths were. 

Still, the best thing is the 300 meg disk pack, delivered to all of the
sites on the network by the boys in green armed to the teeth, containing
the oh_so_secure one time pad. The military actualy does this in some
special cases, and it really is a very good idea; it reduces a comm
and computer security risk (which they may not have a lot of experience 
in) to a straight forward physical security risk (which they have a 
lot more experience in and are more prepared to handle). Of course,
for a network of more than 20 or so sites, it DOES get to be a bit of
a bother. Also, if there is a lot of data moving, then you just want
to use the one time pad data as keys (but maybe VERY long ones!)
and run some normal encryption system. 

Anyone want to figure out how many packs (oppsss... Its 1989 now,

        mention is not very useful:  It would only double the time it
        would take to break the message because a cracker could crack
        the even bits separately from the odd bits.  This would be the
        same difficulty as breaking a system with a 57 bit key.

        Using two DES algorithms in series won't necessarily be the same
        as a 112 bit algorithm, but breaking it will be much harder than
        breaking a 56 bit algorithm.

        Actually, ANSI has already used double length DES keys in some
        of their financial security standards.  By their definition, a
        double length DES key consists of a left half and a right half,
        each of which is a DES key, and encryption is defined as:

	    E[key](data) = E[key.left]( D[key.right]( E[key.left( data)))

        In other words, encrypt with the left half, decrypt with the
        right half, and encrypt with the left half again.  Decryption is
        performed by decryption, encryption, decryption.

        The reason for the three steps is not increased security. 
        Notice that if key.left and key.right are the same DES key than
        the double length encryption function is identical to a standard
        DES encryption function with one of the halves of the key.  
        This means that hardware designed to implement their double
        length-key variant of DES can also perform single length DES
        with no modification.

None have been published.  (Actually, without looking into it in detail,
it might be possible that more than one password would produce the same
encrypted result, so such an "inverse DES" would compute A password, not
THE password.)

LUCIFER differed from DES in other ways, too.

The often-heard suggestion that DES needs a longer key is always based
on the notion of making brute-force search of the entire key space
impractical.  However, that is by no means the only method of attacking
such a system; you should therefore not trust increased key length as
providing substantially more security.  If the 56-bit key space could
indeed be affordably searched in a modest amount of time with available
computer resources, then indeed it would be too short; a sufficiently
long key to render brute-force key searching impractical is NECESSARY
but not SUFFICIENT for secure encryption.

sci.crypt is probably a better newsgroup for cryptographic discussions.

[Moderator tack-on:  Agreed.  If we move the DES stuff there, traffic will
be more balanced between the respective lists.  Unfortunately it's harder
than I'm willing to deal with to forward the stuff from here to there on
a message-by-message basis, so look for a big lump of "the rest of this"
in sci.crypt soon.   _H*]

Granted.  However, zero knowledge authentication implemented in the
right way (e.g. with some sort of smart card) WOULD give security
against account stealing/password grabbing.  It wouldn't give you
secure communications ... but that is a different issue.

I'm not sure if I made it clear in my original posting, but a password
grabber could well reside in the comm's network.  Saying, "don't use
micro's as terminals ... " is not a solution.  

>In our environment the users who use public terminals seem to like the

But unfortunately that is not our experience.  I'm talking about how the
problem can be solved.  Making it harder to steal passwords is not going 
to deter the determined hacker ... and our experience is that some hackers
are VERY determined.

>Now the method of attack has shifted to modern high-performance password
>guessing programs.

Actually, my feeling is that this is an easier problem to solve:
 
1)	Make the encrypted passwords inaccessible to normal users.
&
2)	Log failed login attempts.
&
3)	Stop users from setting their passwords to something that is
	guessable.  Use rules like: at least N characters, no words 
	in a dictionary, at least 1 non-alphabetic character, etc.
	
Point 1) means that the hacker grab a file of encrypted passwords and
feed them through a password guesser.  Instead the hacker has to try
each password guess with the login program, which will show up in 
your logs (hence point 2).  Point 3) means that the hacker is going to
have to try a LOT of password guesses.

Cc: nichols@cbnewsc.att.com, security@pyrite.rutgers.edu

it gets even better than that. If dealing with a location that is accessed 
VERY infrequently, (such as some of the vaults at MITRE), do the following:

coat each button of a, say, 12 button pad with a different organic dye, each
flourescent at a different wavelength spread equally along the visible
spectrum.  Now, assume the combo has a large (say 8) digits in it. The person
types in the combo. Some time later, you come back with a wide-range UV source,
and a decent spectroscope. (like the ones that you saw in jr high physics, only
with a GOOD grating.) Look at each button. One of them will give you EIGHT spec
lines.  one of them will give you SEVEN. Etc. Inverting gives you the
combination.

If two buttons have the same number of lines, it could only happ by having
one of them be used more than once in the combo. Using the relative strengths
of the spec lines will give you hints as to which one it was. Sometimes it
requires a second application designed to figure out a specific question,
(eg "is '4' before or after '8').  Have fun. The dyes used for dye lasers 
are not that expensive, given the minimal amounts you need to use here.
The main problem is that most of them are not transparent to visible light.

Have fun.

CN/A: My personal experience with it here in Chicago is that they will not give
you unlisted numbers (the procedure to get to an unlisted number is set so
that only certain high level DA operators will get to look at it, it sorta goes
like a) there must be an emergency to the family in question you wish to call,
b) the high-level /A operator will take down your name and message, c) the
person will look up the unlisted number and log the listing in some book, 
d) call the number herself and relay the message).  CN/A works slightly 
differently elsewhere, like giving some ID number before you can start rattling
off numbers to look up, whether they will give you unlisted numbers or not,
the number of phone numbers you can get in one call to CN/A, any cost for the
call (I believe they charge it at normal DA rates for CN/A calls), etc.
Basicly, its become a pain nowadays.

lineman's book: I used to have a real worn version of this where it had the 
name of the major town with a street map, and a listing of the name the 
phone was registered to, the phone number which was referenced by the 
street address.  The name I heard this book called by Illinois Bell Telephone
when this book came out was the "Blue Book" (for the blue cover) and it only
covered a certain portion of the area code (this one covered all the North and
Northwest suburbs in the 312 calling area, although the first group of towns
from A to Evanston was torn out).  Pretty interesting nonetheless.

>How many seconds?  Does this rely upon a chip in the card keeping time
>accurate to within a number of seconds over an operating lifetime of

When I last looked at the Security Dynamics one (SecurID), the time per
new value was variable.  If you want fast changing values, you will need
a new card more often (e.g., when I looked at them, they used 6 digit
(decimal) numbers, so if the value changed every 30 seconds, your card
would use up all values in a year).

The SecurID relied on keeping the times in sync, but allowed for a
window of error (e.g., will accept either the current value, or the N
previous or N next values, where N is small).  They seemed to feel it
worked fine, as long as your system keeps reasonable time.  Now, if you
are running Apollos, that could be a real problem ;-).

One issue with these is if you are logging in/out of many different
network machines in a short period (say, from one session on one
machine).   If you have to wait for the next number each time, it
could be a pain; BUT, if it allows you to use the same number, then,
during a small window, it is vulnerable to replay by others.

Also, you have to get new cards periodically, so you are kind of married
to the company...

(a) is most certainly not "undisputed." Indeed, it is quite widlely

It is less clear that they take full responsibility for the
selection of the key length.  However, it is simply not material.
The DES can be, and is widely, implemented in such a way a as to
provide an arbitrary key length.  Would God that it was as widely
used.
 
Given the history of cryptography [KAHN], it should not come as
much of a surprise, but it is nonetheless something of a national
disgrace that the DES is so badly tainted by its association with
the National Security Agency.
 
It should be noted that the DES has already lasted far beyond its
required design life.  Testimony in regard to its recent extension
suggested that it is still good for that life again.  It is time
that we stopped carping and began using.

I, for one, am satisfied that it is.  First, the reports that I

approaching the size numbers used in RSA.  Second, the key length
in RSA is arbitrary.  There seems to be no reason to believe that
the key length cannot stay ahead of the factorers.  Third, the work
factor cost for numbers that we can factor is measured in tens of
thousands of dollars.  We do not need crypto that will resist that
kind of attack.  What we need is something that is one or two
orders of magnitude stronger than the white envelope.
 
Finally, one of the reports on "progress in factoring" was not that
at all; it was rather a report on the use of computers to cooperate
on a grand scale.  While it may have reduced the elapsed time, it
added (overhead for the cooperation) to the total work factor.

I'd like to see your logic on this.  I assume we're both talking about
encrypting with two different 56-bit keys for the double encryption.  If
so, it seems to me that each bit of the output *does* depend on all 112 bits,
and without some known regularity in DES (your "or anything else" implies
that you aren't talking about cryptanalyzing DES) I don't see how this
collapses to 57 effective bits.  (I assume your last sentence means that
it's 2 times as much work (since you're adding only one bit), not 2**n.)

Note that for DES in particular, there is no known way (outside NSA, of
course) to find a single key that would create in one encryption the effect
of two concatenated keys.

I'm probably horrendously naive (nothing new there), but I was just wondering,
If you double encrypt something, using any encryption algorithm, wouldn't that
effectively double the encryption key?  The key word here is effectively, since
you wouldn't have any way of knowing that you had successfully unencrypted the
text once until you successfully unencrypted that text into something
resembling intelligent text.

In other words, if I successfully unencrypt something, I won't know it until I
successfully unencrypt it again.  This would provide an effective (if not
strictly speaking from a mathematical point of view) difficulty level of n**n
and not n**2.  Comments?

Not exactly......
This is what goes into the algorithm
   1) KEY  - the 8 char password you give ; of the 6 bits given, only
             56 (7per char) are used
   2) SALT - a 2 char sequence chosen from a..z, A..Z, 0..9, "." and
             "/" to give the algorithm about 4096 permutations from
             the unmodified DES algorithm 
What is modified
   -a 64 bit piece of constant text (never changed) is encrypted by
    the modified DES routine using your key (password) and the salt
What comes out (in the /etc/passwd file)
   1) the first 2 chars are the salt
   2) the next 11 chars are the encrypted constant text ; only 66 bits
      of the 88 bits are actually significant

How secure is it?
  1) The salt routine is relatively unsophisticated.  It gives some
     measure of protection against a hypothetical machine hardwired to
     decrypt the original DES algorithm.  But it does not increase the
     complexity of the DES algorithm itself in any way.  You're only
     getting 4096 permutations of the DES algorithm, and anyone can
     see the SALT value that was paired with your password.
  2) How secure is the DES algorithm itself.  I refuse to answer that
     question, since I would have to defend my answer against either a
     very angry group of pro-DES people, or a very angry group of
     anti-DES people.  I've seen it happen too often on misc.security
     and sci.crypt.

Note:
   -DES can be used in several different "modes", many of which
    involve making a given encryption of any 64 bits dependant upon a
    previous series of encryptions.
   -this is not the case with passwords encrypted with the SALTed DES
    program... it is 1 straight run through the modified DES algorithm

Want to try an interesting experiment?
   -the algorithm which takes the salt found in your /etc/passwd entry
    and the password you type in at the login prompt, encrypts them,
    and spits out the encrypted constant text for the login program to
    compare against the full entry in the /etc/passwd file is publicly
    executable (of course); it is often called "makekey", and its path
    is usually /usr/lib/makekey
   -input to this algorithm is from standard input, and output is from
    standard output
   
   look at your entry in the /etc/passwd file.  let's say it is:
             //--salt     
      mchamp:ImhkyZkGBZJQE:1056:1056.......
               \\\\\\\\\\\--encrypted constant text

   try piping your password and salt into the program by hand and
   watch it spit out the entire entry /etc/passwd entry..ex
      echo "passwordIm" | /usr/lib/makekey 

   for some key other than "password", this WILL REALLY spit out my
   "encrypted password" (actually, the encrypted constant text) 
   ImhkyZkGBZJQE

   Hints....
    -I'm running on an Encore Mutimax, and the constant text has not
     been changed

If anyone out there can tell me what my password was (I will change it
after posting this), then we'll exchange private mail using a more
secure crypto-system.  

I'm eagerly looking forward to a successful reply.....

On a related note (and possibly one of security interest) is a set of
books published by AT&T, called "Unix System: Reading and
Applications".  Volume II (of apparently II) has a paper written by 
J. A. Reeds and P.J. Weinberger (both of AT&T Bell Labs).

The paper, "File Security and the Unix System Crypt Command",
discusses the processes that crypt uses for encoding data.  It then
proceeds to present the algebraic formulae and procedures to determine
the keyword used for encryption, thereby allow decryption.  It's noted
that the procedure takes about two hours.

It follows by presenting a simple enhancement to crypt that will make
it much more secure, and then proves to you that even this improvement
in encryption technique (or more generally, any reversible encryption
technique) is never secure.  It demonstrates this by presenting the
procedures to break the new encryption.

Since these are commercially available publications that I've seen on
many a B. Dalton shelf, it follows that anyone who wanted the
information to decrypt crypted files, technically has that information
at hand.

I will now prove that I don't know anything about cryptanalysis:  has anybody

56-bit key?  64 has a property that 56 does not share:  it is an integer
power of an integer.  This additional property might introduce additional
properties into the ciphertext, which could be exploited by the cryptanalyst.

Cryptoanalysis is not a particularly exact science.  Some would still call
it an art.

The amount of computing power required to mechanically dissect an unknown
code can be staggering.  I am not sure if DES knows how to break DES or
not.  I do know that DES requires that any codes that are shipped out of
the country are breakable, and that the "recipie" for decryption be given
to the NSA.

Considering what they do, a reasonable assumption.  They do more than JUST
break codes.  They intercept messages from an amazaing array of sources,
both computer and radio, and probably other that we don't know about.

It is possible that DES is reversable through some arcane mathematical
manipulation, or that there is some way to break it down to something
easier to handle.  I am sure that those parts of the VULCAN report would
have been classified if they did, indeed, exist.  This is merely
speculation on my part.

No congressional investigation was necessary to find that out; the design
of Lucifer was published publicly in an IBM research journal, NSA
participated in the design of DES (they suggested changes in the S-boxes
as well, for example), and the resulting DES design is also public knowledge.
Anybody could tell what changes were made from Lucifer to DES.  Most of the
reasons for the changes have not been disclosed, but there is no particular
reason to think they were intended to weaken DES to the point that NSA
would be able to crack it.  I would be quite surprised to find out that
NSA would have been incapable of routinely cracking even a 64-bit keyed DES.

It is quite possible that NSA was able to determine that a 56-bit key was
practically as secure (or as insecure) as a 64-bit one, given foreseeable
improvements in technology through the useful life of DES.

NSA has lots of computing power because it helps them accomplish their
mission.  I suspect that very little of it is applied to cracking DES.
Note that NSA was the world's largest computer user well before DES or
even Lucifer had been invented.

Just because an agency is "spooky" doesn't mean you have to be paranoid
about them.

The paper "On the Security of Multiple Encryption" by Merkle and Hellman
was published in the July, 1981 CACM (Vol. 24, No. 7) (pages 465-467).

The conclusion, in essence, was that triple encryption with two keys is
still vulnerable to attacks that are similar in flavor to the attacks on
double encryption with two keys.  Double encryption with two keys does not
improve security as much as one might hope -- it seems to force the use of
more memory during cryptanalysis, but can still be broken in about 2**57
"operations".

To significantly increase the security of DES would seem to require triple
encryption with three separate keys.  Of course, there is no guarantee that
triple encryption provides substantially more security -- but triple
encryption with two keys has known weaknesses.

To vote, send mail to me marked either "YES" for creation or "NO"

wait until the voting has finished, at which time I will post a
list of all votes received.

The group will be moderated.  The moderator will be Ken van Wyk,

Dave Ferbrache will be the European coordinator of the group.

This will not be a "private" group.  You may subscribe and read it
as easily as you do any other group.  You can submit material as
easily as you can for any other moderated group (e.g. comp.risks,
comp.unix, misc.security, etc.).  If your site has up-to-date news
software, submitting material to moderated groups should appear
identical to submitting material to non-moderated groups.

This will not be a micro-only group.  There currently is a discussion
in virus-l of "exec"-type viruses in IBM mainframe computers.  This
is only an example; other systems are equally welcome.

In conjunction with comp.virus, we have been trying to establish a
number of anti-viral archive sites.  These sites will maintain any
combination of archives of the virus-l/comp.virus group, papers
dealing with computer security, anti-viral software for specific
computers, etc.  We currently have sites in the US and Europe.

(1) I agree that carrying multiple SmartCards would be a =<MAJOR>=
pain, but for small numbers of centrally managed accounts (a SecureID card
can keep up to four (4) different ID's with the same PIN right now), a 
SmartCard is much more user friendly than most of the authentication
devices I've seen.  =<Note that I said DEVICES, not techniques!>=

(2) You have a badge for most of those sites, I'll bet.  What's wrong
with the badge-replacement style of SmartCard?  The ones I've been shown
are not noticeably heavier than my MITRE badge -- lighter than the
[insert expletive here] badge I have to use at DCA-HQS.  And yes, they
can be magstriped.

(3) Now for my knock against ALL the SmartCard vendors:  There needs to
be one central authority to handle the problem of merging multiple cards
into one.  It is silly to have to carry more than one of these critters!

Subj:	[1131] DES export laws

I'm trying to find out what's going on with US DES export laws:
(1) Folks at MIT are trying to get DES exported for their a
   authentication server (project Athena).
(2) Products built on flavors of UNIX (Xenix, Sys V, BSD...)
    You get UNIX and the product as a binary. Is this exportable?
(3) Rumor is UNIX had to have DES software (two different modules
    one waz password crypt.) removed before it could be exported.
    Did they get a ruling or were the corporate lawyers working 
    overtime that night?
(4) I understand the law applies to *all* cryptography and not
    any specific algorithm,device, rotor machine or what have you.
    How un-sophisticated must the algorithm, device, rotor machine
    or what have you be before you've got a better than 50% chance
    of getting approval?
(5) Suppose you take DES binary out and some smart European puts it
    back in, over there?         
(6) About two years back I saw a algorithm built of DES like boxes
    from an author at a Polish university. Think its secure..eh?
    (It was published in a British journal)

Any information would be greatly appreciated.

A University has loaned me a PC for a couple of months.  After some
initial confusion about what I would do for them in return, this is
what they decided they wanted most.
  There is a central site with a bunch of machines: VAX/VMS,
  IBM 4341/VM/CMS, all LANned together and exchanging mail using
  CMDF (a C version of PMDF).  There is a marine research station
  miles and miles away with several PCs, none of them particularly
  big, not (if I've understood correctly) LANned together, and not
  currently using E-mail.  They do have a line to the main site.
  What they want is a scheme (which must use the phonenet protocol)
  whereby the marine biologists at the remote site can receive and
  send mail through the main site.

The irony of this is that I know only as much about mailers as I
couldn't avoid knowing.  It did strike me that these people, who never
have to "log in" to use their PCs, probably aren't going to like having
to give passwords and the like just to use E-mail, which they've not
had before so aren't missing.  It also struck me that in the absence of
shared file-servers, the mail will only be as secure as the floppy
discs it is physically stored on.

The scheme I came up with for authentication is this:
  each person at the remote site who is authorised to use the E-mail
  system would be given a floppy disc containing a version of the
  mail transfer program customised for him.  This would contain all
  the necessary information to identify that user to the mail system.
  The user would be able to make copies of the disc.  Retaining
  control over who can read your mail and who can send mail as you
  would then reduce to retaining physical control over the copies of
  the disc.

The degree of security required here isn't very great.  What's worrying
me is the thought that I might be missing some obvious Risk.  (Either
the phonenet protocol is flawed, or I have misunderstood it:  there
doesn't seem to be any way of preventing someone using this method to
find out which other people at his site have mail waiting at the main
site and who that mail is from, but that's true no matter what the
authentication method is.)

If this isn't the right newsgroup, I apologise for wasting your time.
comp.risks didn't  seem quite right.

How do you deal with passwords in terms of how to make sure that

1) everyone who needs to know them is informed when one changes.
2) if everyone happens to be away and a server or account needs to be accessed,
   how does a non-administrator get the password in an emergency?
   Are the passwords written down someplace that can be accessed by
   someone who has the need to in an emergency.  If so how do you prevent
   someone from stealing a look at this "book" ie the janitors who
   have keys to everything?

I am dealing with these issues and was wondering what people would recommend.

Subj:	[3474] Re:  Card Access information request
Cc: security@pyrite.rutgers.edu

WIEGAND is by far the best card technology that is available today
(I exclude smart cards, since they are a new technology and have 
their own special problems). 

Mag cards will get erased by things, and will wear physically, and 
will go bad, and will be an administrative nightmare about a year
(maybe a lot less) after they are installed. WIEGAND cards work
by having a thin bi-metal wire embedded in the card. The wire is
subjected to heating, magnetic fields, and mechanical twisting 
at the factory in order to encode the proper data into it. It is 
NOT a magnetic system, and is not subject to being screwed up
by magnetic fields that you are likely to encounter in reality
(I ruined a WIEGAND card on a Cyclotron Analyser magnet once, 
but that was an exceptional case, since it was bending a 200 Mev
beam at the time, and thus was generating a BIT of a field).

The wire is swept through a magnetic field set up by the reader,
and the field itself is monitored. As the various parts of the 
wire pass through the field, they will cause fluctuations in
it which are read and used as data. Very slick. These readers are 
epoxy encapsulated, so they never fail because of stuff getting
into them and need no maintenance, something that can not be said

for mag cards. Wiegand readers work underwater for example, which 
may sound useless, but there is a US Navy location that has them 
installed on under water weapons storage (mines or something I 
would guess....) vaults in Maryland. It means that if your card
gets soaked in the rain, the card and the reader don't care.
It really is a great technology. I have seen cards for Kastle 
Systems (here in the DC area, they do access control for more
than 350 buildings) that people have been sitting on (in their
back pockets I assume) for years and have shattered them, barely
held together by scotch tape, and they still work fine. Try that
with any other technology.

The RF based cards, refered to as Sludge Cards since the company
that makes them is Sladge (spelling?) are not really all that 
winning, though they do have their good points. They can be read
through your clothes, so you can leave your wallet in your pocket
and just get your rump up against the reader (if they are nice enough
to put it that low!) and zap! you are in, unless you have something
else metal in your wallet that can screw up the RF reading of the
card. The cards are somewhat sensitive to physical damage, not that
they are delicate per se, but if they DO get hurt they stop 
working at once since it changes the RF emmission characteristics
of the card. The other drawback is security; there exists in the 
DC area somewhere (I don't know who ended up with it) and 'Boom
Box' (radio, cassette, etc) that only plays cassettes, since its
innards have been replaced with a modified version of the 
Sludge Card reader. You sit down next to the reader (as close 
as you can get the box to it, in any case) and when the person 
with the card get near, it will read the card while it is still in
their purse, wallet, etc. Walking through a downtown (K street)
McDonalds with this device several years ago (when we built it)
yielded a slew of card data. If you are near their entrance and 
watch them walk in, and get their card data as they pass by, I 
assume that it would not be too hard to build cards to match
the data that you recorded, and then waltz (or bop, or shuffle)
right on in.....

I consider this a security risk.

Subj:	[2467] Re: MEDCO locks

The way I have understood medeco to work, is that they will license a
locksmith for the use of one specific and unique blank.  Medeco will
only sell this unique blank to that locksmith, thereby, the only
people who will be able to "officially" copy a medeco key would be the
locksmith, and medeco.  This is all in keeping with the "high
security" aspect of medeco locks.  Since they restrict the blanks on a
per locksmith basis, only the locksmith who installed your cylinder
will be able to duplicate the key, and thereby, he should know who has
keys, and can only make keys for only people with legitimate needs.

To the best of my knowledge, there are two universal medeco blanks.
They are available to any schmuck who can figure out how to get them.
I'm not certain, but I believe one of the two is for a 5 pin cylinder
and the other is an identical blank only made for 6 pin.  There is a 
third party vender that is making clones of these keys (It may be Ilco,
but I'm not positive) which seem to work well, and are cheaper than buying
them from medeco.

>   Naturally, some enterprising metalwork can usually get around this...

The beauty of medecos is that they have a very large keyway, and it
usually isn't terribly difficult to do some creative milling on other
blanks to get one that will fit.  I know of people that have made
duplicates of medeco keys using brickstrap, but the resultant keys
aren't always reliable as the surface area of the key on which the
beveled cut is made to rotate the pin isn't very large, and the pins
may not always rotate properly.

In terms of other locks which are difficult to get copied, I'd probably
recommend abloy.  Not only are they difficult to pick, but you have
an example of security through obscurity.  There aren't many people who
have the facilities to copy abloy keys.  I don't know if they have a similar
licensing procedure in terms of blanks.  From what I have seen, I tend 
to believe that they don't.  I have never seen any third party abloy clone
keys, thereby making abloy your only source for key blanks.

Has anyone ever had any experience in picking abloys?  I've heard of it
being done, but not by using standard methods.

Subj:	[1245] re: Medeco Keys

   I had heard that Medco keys cannot be copied by your local locksmith...

Yeah, this is usually true, depending upon who your local locksmith is.
Most smaller locksmiths just dont have the money to purchase the special
machine which cuts Medeco keys.  Each key cut is cut at a specific angle
and the machine is *VERY* accurate.  Consequently, many locksmiths will
send your request for a key either to the factory, or to a larger outfit
which does have a Medeco key cutting machine.

Each Medeco key/cylinder comes with a "credit card" that has a specific
factory-assigned number on it.  When you ask for a duplicate key, the locksmith
takes the card, runs it thru a credit card like machine onto a special form
from Medeco, and sends the form, and whatever he/she/it charges ya for the
key (the place I work for charges $5.00/key + certified mailing costs).

Also the locks are pretty hard to pick, but not impossible.

One thing to consider tho, is that the security provided by the lock is only
as great as the surrounding door frame/door.  I.e.: If the door/door frame
are pretty cheesy, then having an $80 lock isnt worth it...

Subj:	[2824] Re: MEDCO locks

Medeco has a range of varying security key blanks.  All differing in
their difficulty to copy.

They replaced a key system about two years ago.  Those keys can be
duplicated through contracted locksmiths.  It is assumed that they
will follow the Medeco guidelines for duplication (which is require ID
against a "Valids" list, make the copies, then have you return to pick
them up).

The keys they replaced this system with are only available through
Medeco directly.

To duplicate the key, you must go to a contracted locksmith who has
your account on file.  You must request a key by _number_, and sign a
form.  You must be on a list of authorized parties...  Once verified
by the locksmith as to your identity, the request is delivered to
Medeco who also does their own verification against an authorization
file, and then make the copies.  The copies are shipped to the
locksmith, where you can pick them up, showing proper ID.

This is the plan, at least... :-)

But, keep in mind that a lock is only as good as the door and frame
around it.  if your hinges are exposed to the outside, pin the
hinges.  Also pay attention to the strike plate area.  A steel door
and steel frame can be pried far enough apart with a crowbar to let
you get in.  The lock does nothing for you here.  Cover the strike
plate zone with a door-strike guard, at least.  Next, can the entire
lock mechanism be cut out?  I've seen gadgets that attach to the door
handle, and a little battery operated cutting blade will cut the whole
lock mechanism out of the door.  Works on wood and steel.

You'll never beat them, but you can discourage them...

As the moderator said, that's probably Medeco.  Machines for duplicating
Medeco keys are available to locksmiths.  The blanks are probably harder to
obtain, but anyone with access to a good milling machine could in principle
manufacture his own.  The main protection is that your corner drugstore is
probably incapable of correctly duplicating Medeco keys, and most locksmiths
realize that they are "high-security" items and should verify that you're
entitled to make copies before doing so.

Sargent's KESO series, since emulated with slight variations by other
manufacturers, uses dimples drilled into the sides of the blank rather
than notches cut out of the edge.  Not many key duplicators are set up
to duplicate/manufacture KESO keys.

I think forced entry is more likely for most businesses than unauthorized
key duplication; you can always rekey when an employee leaves (and it's
pretty easy to do so if you use interchangeable-core cylinders).

Subj:	[1469] Password guessing technology
Cc: security@pyrite.rutgers.edu

We have added the following rules to our passwd program:

All candidate passwords must pass these tests:

	- It must be at least 6 characters long.

	- It must contain at least 1 non-alphanumeric character.

	- If there is only 1 non-alphanumeric character, it must not
	be the last character.

	- It must contain at least 4 distinct characters.

Six variations of the candidate password are also checked further.
The variations are:

	- The candidate password,

	- All but the first character of the candidate password,

	- All but the last character of the candidate password, and

	- The reversed versions of the first three.

The further checks are:

	- Against the system dictionary,

	- Against an auxilliary "hit list" file, which includes the
	Internet virus list, all examples, and other special cases.

	- Appearance in /etc/passwd or /etc/group (this check catches
	the user name, first name, last name, and group name),

	- Against the form: <user name><user name>, and

	- Against the form: <user name><any><user name>.

All checks are made ignoring upper/lower case.

Of the approximately 1.9 billion passwords that consist of 6
characters, 5 of which are lower-case alphabetic and digit characters
and 1 of which is a special character, these restrictions eliminate
(very roughly) 10 million.

In addition, we have a shadow password file and other changes.

  This isn't a problem really.  There are phone numbers you can dial to get
the correct time (international standards, inference clocks) accurate to
some fraction of a millisecond.  The macintosh pd program "setclock" uses
this mechanism to get the 'correct' time.  The card only needs to be able to
resync before connecting to the remote system (assuming the remote uses an
accurate clock as well).

  Alternatively, the card can sync with the remote as part of the handshake. 
After all trading times in clear text can hardly pose any kind of security
breach.

Subj:	[1952] Re:  password security

	We deal with the need-to-know problem in a fairly simplistic way.
We keep our root password inside of a sealed (and taped-shut) envelope that
is stored in a lock-box.  Those people who might actually need to know it in
an emergency have a key to that lock-box.  The envelope is checked daily.  If
someone needs to know the password in an emergency, they must go into the
machine room, where the lock-box is -- only about 12 people have keys to this
room, and of those 12, only 8 have keys to the lock-box, and of those 8, 5 
already know the root password (whew -- what a great sentence :-).  From 
there, they must sign their name and write down the reason they took the root
password.  As soon as the system staff come in, the password is immediately
changed, and a quick audit is done of the file system (all automated in shell
scripts, so it's not too difficult).

	This does rely on the fact that you know everyone who has access to
the lock-box, and that they can be trusted to sign for the password when they
take it.  We've only had one problem with this, and that was when a new admin
on one of our smaller machines thought he had a valid reason to access the 
password, and did so.  When we came in, we found the machine in single-user
mode with no one in sight.  That operator was "re-educated", and we haven't
had any problems since then.

	It is important to make the envelope fairly tamper-resistant (we use
a thick manilla (opaque) envelope with a smaller envelope inside of it.  Both
are sealed, and the outer one is taped shut.  We've never had a problem with
someone trying to open it without being noticed.

	Another security feature you could add to make this safer is to have
a video camera trained on the lock-box and run it all day long.  If you had
any doubts about someone breaking in, just check the tape.

	Well, that's my $0.25 worth.

I agree that you should use whatever you can get your
hands on for illumination of code buttons; I mentioned 
laser dyes because I happened to have a lot of them around at
the time that I first tried this, and it worked very well.

Most of the dyes that I have used are pretty common, pretty cheap,
and to the best of my knowledge none of the ones that I have used
have been toxic....

One consideration in choosing the dye to use (for buttons, not for 
lasers) is what it looks like in regular light, since you don't 
want people seeing it on the buttons. ANother consideration is the 
method of application. One reason the laser dyes worked so well
was the fact that they were disolved in solvents, usualy alcohol
but also ether some times. In a spritzer bottle, these can be sprayed
on the target area where they will dry quickly, leaving a very fine
and uniform distribution of the dye material which is very likely
to escape detection. DO make sure that the solvent doesn't melt
the materials that the buttons, etc. are made of though.....

Subj:	[1097] Re: password security

You'll be better off *not* sharing passwords due to the problems you've
raised here as well as other problems that shared passwords can cause.
It is more desirable and auditable for you to be able to logon to
the "commonly shared" userid with other "authorized" passwords.  This
method has several advantages:

-provides auditability by requiring the "real" logon persons
 to identify themselves (via their password)
-allows you to change passwords of shared userids without contacting
 all users who logon to those userids (if you still need the "normal"
 logon password)
-makes encrypting passwords more feasible
-no need to memorize multiple passwords for various userids

Of course, this scheme does imply that more than the single standard
password can be used to logon.  If you're running VM, which your node
name suggests, VMSECURE implemented this scheme nicely in Release 3.2
I believe.  VMSECURE calls it the LOGONBY access rule.  I'm not sure
if RACF or other VM security package equivalents have this feature.

That service is unavailable until a staff member can fix it.  We strive not

Subj:	[1678] Password Security

The way to know make sure that everyone who needs to know knows when a
password changes is to have only one person per userid.  This also gets
you accountability.  As for data set passwords, if you have a good
access control system (like the ones my employer makes) you don't need
them; since the one userid/password scheme can assure that the person is
who he claims to be, you merely need to tell the access control system
who can get at what.  (Of course, for the accountability to work, you
need to do the ordinary stuff about not writing down the passwords, not
using your name, or your girlfriends name, or your social security
number, or whatever, etc.)

One approach to what to do when the security administrator isn't around
is to have a special security administrator userid whose password is in
a sealed envelope.  If your shop is a mainframe shop, you give it to the
night shift operations supervisor.  Otherwise you put it in a "break
glass" sort of box.  Every morning, the real security officer checks to
see if the envelope has been opened.  If so, he immediately changes the
password and investigates what was done with it.

There is some exposure here, since this is a detective control.  If you
don't have an access control system with good logging capabilities, you
won't know what was done with the special userid.  And if the person who
uses it is a very sharp crook, he may be able to wipe out the logging
anyway, if the userid in the envelope is powerfull enough.  But if you
can't afford to have full-shift security officer coverage, it works
better than giving everyone security privileges.

The voting period for the new newsgroup comp.virus has just ended.
The final vote count was 403 YES, 30 NO.  I think it's fair to say
that significant interest has been shown in this group.  The list
of voters will be posted in news.groups so you may verify that your
vote was recorded.  I'll gladly accept any corrections, although
it would take a rather colossal error to affect the outcome of the
vote.

As per the "official guidelines", the group should be formed in
approximately five days.  (Today being 24-Apr-89.)  Look for it
soon at a computer near you.

There has been some interest in the mailng list virus-l.  Comp.virus
and virus-l will contain the same information, the only difference
being the method of distribution.  The following information should
assist you in subscribing to the list.  Note that it is NOT necessary
to subscribe to virus-l if you receive Usenet.  Also, if you receive
Usenet and subscribe to virus-l, you should unsubscribe once the
group comp.virus is formed.  There are currently about 1175 direct
subscribers to virus-l, so I'm sure Ken would appreciate the reduced
load.

This has gone far enough.

When I was in New York, I was living with a cocaine dealer who had a 
Medeco lock on her front door.  I wanted a spare key for my girlfriend,
but the landlady wouldn't give one to me.

I took the key to a tiny, Israeli locksmith near 98th street and Broadway.
He measuered the hights of each using a tool with a triangular hole in it
(with calibrations along the side), and wrote down the orientation of each
notch.  He then took a blank (that did not say "Medeco" on it) put it in
a machine and started cutting the key.  On each notch, he would change the
orientation of the blank in the machine, in accordance with the original.

The process took about 4 minutes and cost $5.00.  The key worked the first
time.

Subj:	[1679] connecting Suns to the internet: pitfalls?

A client has a small network of Suns that they would like
to connect to the internet.  They would accomplish this
by bridging to the ethernet operated by the umbrella
organization of which they are loosely a part.  They
have limited experience with this style of networking,
having transitioned from VMS/THEnet only recently.  They
are very concerned about security.  Not spooky, just
the normal desire to have the system continue to work
most of the time.

The system is a 3/280 + 4 diskless Sun3 clients; some 386i
stuff will be attached soon.  All running SunOS4.0.1.
The environment is quasi-academic, with lots of students
hanging around.  The attack scenarios we are most concerned
with are the typical things you see at schools rather than
sophisticated industrial espionage attacks.

I haven't been through this before.  I know a bit about
security in general and securing a regular timesharing
sort of system, but all the networks (and especially
NFS systems) I've been responsible for have been isolated.

I would appreciate any advice you might have to offer.
Something like a checklist of things to button up or
turn off seems a good goal, but priciples, platitutes,
and references are also welcome.  Ultimately I would like
to have enough information to be able to tell my client that
his system is safe to connect.

Subject: Re: DES software

>I need to find a copy (or, preferably, a summary written in English instead
>of legalese) of the American regulations that restrict the export of DES and
>other cryptographic software.  Does anybody know where I can find this?

Let me start with a disclaimer:  I'm speaking only for myself here, most
definitely not for my employer or anyone else I refer to below, and only
as an interested layman.

You will not be able to find a non-legalese summary.  (Hubris makes me
want to add "other than this one." :-)  You will only be able to find
legalese rules and such.  Your best bet is to hunt through a law library
and a one that has the US Federal Register.

There are two popular researched analyses on DES that were distributed on
Usenet.  One is by John Gilmore, the other is by DEC's Corporate Law
Office.  Lots of other opinion and "facts" have been offered, but almost
without exception they have been based on ignorance; unless you've done
research, or have the two primary sources, it's probably safe to ignore
everything you've read other than this.  (There's that hubris again.)

DES export is a complicated issue, and like all legal issues when you
get an opinion you should keep in mind the viewpoing of the person who
gives it.  John wants to spread open information as widely as possible,
DEC doesn't want to get hauled into court.  I agree with John.

>From his readings of the rules and regulations, John determined that
DES is technical information, and software.  This means that it is under
the control of the Department of Commerce.  As such, once it is in the
open literature, it can be passed around the world.  In terms of Usenet
and distributing source, this might mean someone would first have to
publish their code in a journal somewhere.  The only exception to this is
if you're on a small list of banned countries, and even that might not
hold.

DEC claims that John is wrong, that DES is specifically called out as
munitions, and therefore is under the control of the Department of
Defense, specifically the Munitions Control Act.  The upshot is that
you can't give it outside of the USA.  I'm not a lawyer, but the took
John's analysis apart sentence by sentence, ending with "It is imperative
that no Digital employee act in reliance on Gilmore's analysis or his
conclusions."  They even used SCREAMING all-caps.

Since neither Department is an expert, the NSA acts as the technical
advisory expert.  Based on a couple of phone calls, chats with some
former employees, and a DES-related meeting, the NSA's position is that
DES should not leave the country.

Because of this, many Unix vendors have two versions of their software,
and it depends on whether they ship the DES cryptographic stuff or not.
I remember reading a note from one of the Unix originators, that the only
reason there were two versions of Version 7 was more administrative than
legal.  Perhaps if someone back then was able to fight the red tape we'd
be spared all this mess today, perhaps not.  I've heard Amdahl got the
right permissions to export DES, but I don't know for sure; it was only
"planned" at the time I read that note, they may have backed down.

DES export has been discussed, at times, in sci.crypt, and in the Kerberos
and Internet Engineering Task Force mailing lists.

Switching from reporter to interpreter, let me say that I think the
situation is changing, and that the stupid US rules may -- applicable or
not -- may be lifted soon.  Note that soon is measured on a beaurocratic
time scale, which is similar to geologic time.  The technical community,
in particular the Internet, has a good channel into the Department of
Defense, and the right word seems to be reaching the right people.  There
is a need for DES to be used globally, and there has been world-wide
publication (in comp.sources.unix/unix-sources) of a package written in
Finland, posted from Australia.

I no longer have John's analysis at all (it was mostly private email, that
he later posted), and I do have the DEC analysis.  I don't like to
distribute it since it has the look of a DEC internal thing (even though
it was forwarded, second-hand, to sci.crypt), and especially since I don't
have John's work.  It is, however, interesting reading, and if someone is
going to take up the fight (as opposed to just idle curiousity), let me
know.

If you want to play lawyer, here are some places to start:
	Department of State
	You want sections 120-126, at least, of the International
	Traffic in Arms Regulation 22C.F.R Subch. M (I don't
	know what that last part means.)

	Office of Munitions Control, Department of State
	They're responsible for saying if something is "munitions."

	The National Security Agency
	I've heard their DES tech expert left, and they're in
	the lurch.  It's funny the way the answer their phones.

	Department of Defense
	You want Section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act.

	Department of Commerce
	You want the Commodity Control List, and
	Export Administration Regulations, Section 370.10
	and 379.3 (General License GTDA).

I like to know what's going on, and I seem to be in touch with the several
areas where this is discussed, so if you start digging around, I'd like to
know.  Yes, that means I'm offering to be a "point man" on this.

Hmm, what's the use in using shell scripts if they can be changed by
whoever last used the root password?  Or, do you keep these scripts off
line and just put them on the system when you need to make these checks?
If I were a nasty employee (not to imply that you have such people where
you are), I would get the password, do my damage, and then change the
script to something like:
	echo "Everything's okee dokee!  No reason to be suspicious!"
 	(or whatever the appropriate message is)
What's to stop this kind of nonsense?

Subj:	[1898] passwords 

I've often advocated the following around our shop, but nobody else wanted to
bother with it: Administrators would normally be non-privileged, just like any
other user, but they'd be able to run a magic program that accepts a
*different* password that is unique to the person [taken from /etc/magicpasswd
or some such], and if correct drops a root shell [privileged job for non-unix
folks] on their terminal.  We currently have such a magic program, but it
doesn't ask for a password.  Okay, so you have to remember an extra password,
but BFD.  Unfortunately this still doesn't prevent someone from trojan-horsing
your .cshrc or other init files, but it does prevent someone random from
finding a terminal you left logged in by mistake and whomping all over the
system right then.  Now, the remaining question is, whether it asks for a
password or not: how do you tell before invoking such a thing if you've been
trojan-horsed for the next time 'round after something like that happens?  You
certainly aren't going to want to sit there and read over your own login init
every time you want to do something privileged.  Answer a is, of course, don't
leave yourself logged in on a public terminal; answers b, c, d..  are left to
the reader.

On a vax I ran a while back I had a fairly elaborate mechanism which would
checksum as many of the various init files that the privileged job would invoke
that I could find; and if any of them failed it would yell loudly.  Said
mechanism was protected from prying eyes; it had a separate built-in password,
etc, etc. and was probably far more than anyone would normally want to deal
with.  Naturally, I'd have to go update the mechanism whenever I updated my
init files.  But by throwing up enough firewalls, even for myself [and typing
the appropriate things needed quickly became microcoded into my fingers] made
the machine quite a bit more secure.

Greetings to all you *net-landers*!

I have been recently assigned a task to investigate methods for enhancing
security on our "Super Computer Network" (1 Cray 3 Convex).  In addition
to this, I am supposed to "search and destroy" any security holes.
For instance:  Our convexes, being 4.2 based, had some *nasty* 4.2 bugs
with the set process group, writing to ttys, and chfn.

I am trying to compile a set of "test" programs that will check for these
and other security holes.  Could anyone give me a list of well known and
not so well known security holes for 4.2 and 4.3 BSD and System V (UNICOS).

Lists, explanations, code to exploit these holes will all be welcome and
very much appreciated.  Please *do not* post any code, but mail it directly
to me at one of the below addresses.

Any suggestions for security enhancement (not recently posted) would also
be appreciated.

Thanks Alot!

			       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
				   DON'T (it's that simple)

Two comments:

1)     On the system that I am running, I have a program called "do" which
will allow users to execute commands as root.  The user must be in a "doers" 
file and a member of the "cando" group.  The "doers" file can also restrict 
members of "cando" to a limited set of commands.  All commands executed using
do are logged (including failed command attempts), of course one can get around
the logging by "doing" a command which allowed shell escapes (but I am working
on that).

2)     Have overhead accounts, 1 for each person that needs the password, and
give them all the same user-id. (ie).

root:/\/\/\/\/\/\:0:1:Root of All Evil:/:/bin/tcsh
nobody:*:-2:-2::/:
daemon:*:1:1::/:
  ...
audit:*:9:9::/etc/security/audit:/bin/tcsh
  ...
need1:abcdefghij:9:9:Mr. John Doe:/etc/security:/bin/csh
need2:klmnopqrst:9:9:Ms. Jane Doe:/etc/security:/bin/csh
  ...

Now if "need1" logs in with his password, then he becomes "audit".
The same goes for "need2", but with her password.
You can check wtmp for the last time that they logged in, and use lastcomm
to see what they did (under "audit").  Of course this is *NOT* a good idea
for root access.

-- For root acess, use something like "do" --

Medeco patents each of their key blanks.  The patents on the older
keyways ran out a couple of years ago and blanks started showing up,
which is one of the reasons that Medeco has moved into the Biaxial locks.

I would be interested to know if the key you had copied had a round or
a square shoulder end(the part you hold onto).  I think all the older
keyways had round keys.  It is certainly interesting news if the
Biaxial Medeco key blanks are available in spite of the patent
infringement.  

Of course as people have pointed out, if you are good with a
machinest's file or a milling machine, not having the key blank is not
a problem.  But that kind of person is difficult to keep out of a bank

Please realize the whole point is that Medeco locks and keys aren't
that they can't be duplicated, but that they are normally very
difficult to do so.  The vast majority of people wanting to make a
copy won't go through the effort to find someone as you described,
and if they did, they probably wouldn't have the same first time
success rate.  Doing so, depending on the environment where the key is
intended for, may show criminal intent.  You can't really say that
about your normal household locks you get from the hardware store.

On the other hand, picking a Medeco lock is again, significantly more
difficult than other locks.

Nothing is 100% guaranteed secure, but you can make the "average"
criminal go somewhere else and leave you alone.  This is generally the
goal.

The only way that you can prevent keys from being duplicated is don't
put a keyed lock on a door, and don't distibute keys for that lock
that doesn't exist.

Rekeying isn't difficult or expensive to do yourself, either.  I recently
bought a $20 kit for schlage rekeying at the local Home club.  It comes
complete with instructions and some tools, all you need is screwdriver and
pliers.  Re-keying requires that you have both new and old keys, so it works
best if you have a collection of keys to pick from when rekeying.  You could
file a key and make a new one, too.  There is a gauge included that could
be used to determine when the filing had reached a new 'standard' depth.
The kit also includes a large quantity of each standard pin size as well
as replacement springs in case they get lost or lose their force.  I've done
fifteen or twenty locks now and since you exchange pins rather than lose them
you can almost handle an indefinite number of locks.  Eventually you'll run
out of a particular size and have to buy more of them or a new kit.

Well, the problem is that by virtue of this mail you've now announced

all the crackers have to do is take your version of crypt along with

Your best bet is to convince your users (by moral suasion or,

In theory, you can use any encryption you would like in place of the
crypt command (or, for that matter, no excryption whatsoever.)
The problem presented is this: All old excryptions will obviously be
incompatable with the new encryption routine, so for every user on
your system, you will have to erase their password and create another,
using the new encryption method. (This can probably be accomplished
by creating a program that is similar to 'passwd', but operates on a
copy of the /etc/passwd file, give users, say, 2 days to 'install their
future password', and after that two days, replace the login command
and the /etc/passwd file.)

However, if this is a new system you are setting up, things will be
extremely easy for you!!

I suspect that you would be OK if you made the change to crypt(3),
and assured that the few minor items mentioned below have been seen
to.

(a) Only the password encryption routine is affected.
	anyone using the standard setkey/encrypt package in
	the same module must be left unaffected!
(b) You get ALL of the programs re-built and installed
	at the same time.  That includes passwd(1), login(1),
	newgrp(1), su(1) wheel(1), wheelg(1), &c.
(c) You have some magical way to get your users to
	(1) all be logged in when you make the change, and
	(2) get them to all change their passwords NOW.
(d) You ferret out the local stuff which also depends
	on crypt(3) and re-build it.  Someone has something which
	needs a password to run, and he didn't tell you about it.
(e) Something at boot-up may want a password, too.  Don't
	forget to fix it!
(f) You replace your old back-ups with the old encryption
	in /etc/passwd and /etc/group and /etc/d_passwd and
	any other files with passwords.

Summary (too late to do you much good:-)
Considering the effort, and the danger, and the certainty that you

(I am unable to tell whether this posting is "tongue-in-cheek."  I will
assume that it is intended to be sincere.)

In order to be effective a password must be known by no more than one
person.  In the kind of open systems in which we deal (i.e., with many
privileged users), the only way to be sure that it is known to only one
person is to use it only once.

The solution to this dilemma, dealt with many times in this forum in
One-time password generators.  This mechanism also provides for the
passing and withdrawing of high privilege, since, unlike a password, the
generator can be returned.

(The discussion by the "secure" installation where five people know the
root password and another copy is kept in a lock box is too absurd to
deal with.  If a system is so unstable that it takes five people with
privilege to keep  it up, it cannot be said to be secure in any
meaningful sense anyway, but if five people share the password any way,
then how you protect and account for the use of any copy is not
material.)

You don't have to erase old encrypted passwords when you change

But what if the new version of crypt is not public (the source code
does not exist on a publicly accessible machine, and the appropriate
permission bits are set so that the executables are not readable, etc.)?
Unless one is willing to apply cryptographic techniques to determine
the algorithm (in which case you probably need more security than just
password protection, anyway), this still seems like an improvement over
using the standard crypt for passwords (assuming the new algorithm is
sufficiently good, of course).

	The version I use to check things lives in my bedroom at home.  If
these people can break into my house and modify the tape, then I guess I have
larger problems than system security :-|.

	The fact that few people (until I sent this note out :-) knew that
such scripts even existed makes it a little less likely that they'd be found
(they also live so far down in the filesystem that I occasionally have trouble
remembering where they are).  When we do check the system, though, we either 
make a visual check of the scripts before running them, or bring my tape in 
from home.  Of course, University security requirements aren't QUITE as 
stringent as those required by, say, the DoD.

 From my own experience, it seems to me that DES per se is not excluded from

AppleShare File Server, that uses DES to encrypt passwords, and that was
granted a Commerce Jurisdiction (meaning Apple is free to export it).
Clearly, we would not have been able to export it if we used DES for file
encryption.

Software vendors could do the following:

Take their software product without any non-export stuff to some of
their labs outside US. At that site, include some outside-US
DES-package into their product, or even better, ship their product in
relocatable form, so customer can link any encryption package with it.

My DES-package can be used freely for non-commercial purposes. If a
vendor ships my DES-package in source code (and optionally in
relocatable code) with their product so that customer can link it
together himself, I consider this as non-commercial use. The idea is
that the customer could do the same even if the vendor wouldn'n
provide the DES-package.

If the vendor packages their product and DES together (eg. linking
them into an executable) I consider this as a commercial use.

In my opinion:

Software vendors should ship all their software also in reloacatable
form!!

My DES-package is available by ftp at kampi.hut.fi (128.214.3.9) at

On our 4.3 BSD Unix system, we have three people that need

Then, a security directive came around: one account, only one
person knows the password.

We set up three accounts, with names other than "root", and
uid 0, gid 1.  Each account has it's own password, and I
changed the "root" password to something I've already forgotten.
We put hooks in /.login and /.cshrc to source files of our own.
This scheme has worked fine for several years now.

To help other users identify "root" users when logged in, we

I'd guess a large pair of bolt-cutters would get either one off in a few

I carry an ordinary Boy Scout knife in my pocket the same as I carry

other metal objects I have into my briefcase to be x-rayed and I have
never had any problems.

About a month ago I went through airport security (in San Diego)
without anything to be put on the x-ray belt, so I just pulled the
knife out of my pocket and placed it on one of those little trays they
have for change and stuff.  As I walked through the metal detector the
guard picked up my knife and looked at it.  He opened the blade
part-way (perhaps to see if it was a switch-blade? or to check the
size of the blade?), closed it, and gave it back to me without
comment.

A similar thing happened about 9 years ago in Chicago, except the
guard told me, "just don't kill anybody."  Seriously!

It sounds as if the airline security folks are fairly sensible about
the types of things you can and can't take on an airline with you.  I
would be shocked if they tried to prevent me from taking on board my
mechanical pencil, which is a pointed metal object about the same

Subj:	[1927] Re: Consensus on locks?

I have seen many postings on a variety of problems with so-called high
security standard-cylinder-type locks.  While no such lock is perfect,
it would seem that there might be a consensus that some particular
product line is the least likely to be easily picked or forced by garden-
variety burglars, and may even slow down an expert.  If there is such
a consensus on a company/product line, I would appreciate knowing what it is.

A sort of related question is:  I have seen locks with automatic "dead bolts"
 - meaning, locks in which opening the door with a key from the outside
(not in the handle) pulls back a full-sized spring loaded bolt, which closes
when the door is closed.  The obvious idea is to prevent "loiding" (I think
this is the term...), and also to provide more resistance to forcing than
the relatively narrow bars which are used on some locks for the same purpose.
Does anyone know the availability of these locks and whether they have any
advantage over the standard narrow bar type?  (I am no lock expert, in case
it isn't obvious :-)     ).  I assume that such a lock would have to be well
lubricated to allow the torque of a key to open a large bolt, but what other
disadvantages are there?

prevent carding, loiding, sliding, whatever you want to call it, is to provide
an extra latch piece that is pushed into the mortise edge when the door is
closed, and engages a catch that prevents the main latch from being pushed
in.  These are well-known to, um, not work in many installations.  The sure-
fire way to lock the door is a dead bolt or better, but you can't just slam

Rekeying is feasible depending on the availability of pins.  Many

.003 or .005 increments).  Medeco and a few other companies (Best
comes to mind) use different size pins that aren't as easily
available.  Medeco also requires very specific types of pins if they
are addressing the sidebar, otherwise, other pins are useless.

What I would really like to see is more venders going to the hex-nut

quicker.

I've just gotten the word that a substantially reworked version of

structure of FIPS 46 and replaces many of the bit picking that slows
most computer  implementations.  I havn't been told how much of a 
speed up this will have over the FIPS 46  version of the algorithm.
The new version has eliminated some of the "rounds" structure
of the current algorithm and still computes the same DES process.

less expensive and will provide a base for faster IC implementations.

>Attorneys said yesterday they are negotiating a second plea
>bargain for computer hacker Kevin Mitnick

   Kevin Mitnick, the hacker "so dangerous that he can't even be allowed to use
a phone". "He could ruin your life with his keyboard". "Armed with a keyboard
and considered dangerous."

   These are some of the things that have been said about this person. All
of this media hype would be fine if it just sold news papers. But it has done
much more then just sell a few papers. It has influenced those that will
ultimately decide his fate. I myself don't know the man, but I have talked to
others that do. Including one of the persons that investigated Mitnick.  From
all I have heard about him, I think he is a slime ball!
But even a slime ball should not be railroaded into a prison sentence that
others of equal or greater guilt have avoided. 

I personally feel the man is just a criminal, like the guy that robs a 7/11,
no better but certainly not any worse. 
Unfortunately he is thought of as some kind of a "SUPER HACKER".
The head of LA Police Dept's Computer Crime Unit is quoted as saying
"Mitnick is several levels above what you would characterize as a computer
hacker".                                                           

   No disrespect intended, but a statement like this from the head of a
computer crime unit indicates his ignorance on the ability of hackers
and phone phreaks. Sure he did things like access and perhaps even altered 
Police Dept. criminal records, credit records at TRW Corp, and Pacific
Telephone, disconnecting phones of people he didn't like etc.
But what is not understood by most people outside of the hack/phreak world is
that these things are VERY EASY TO DO AND ARE DONE ALL THE TIME.
In the hack/phreak community such manipulation of computer and phone systems
is all to easy. I see nothing special about his ability to do this.
The only thing special about Kevin Mitnick is that he is not a "novice" hacker
like most of the thirteen year old kids that get busted for hacking/phreaking.
It has been a number of years since an "advanced" hacker has been arrested.
Not since the days of the Inner Circle gang have law enforcement authorities
had to deal with a hacker working at this level of ability. As a general
rule, advanced hackers do not get caught because of there activity but rather
it is almost always others that turn them in. 
It is therefore easy to understand why his abilities are perceived as being
extraordinary when in fact they are not. 

Because of all the media hype this case has received I'm afraid that: 

1.) He will not be treated fairly. He will be judged as a much greater threat
to society then others that have committed simular crimes.

2.) He will become some kind of folk hero. A Jesse James with a keyboard.
    This will only cause other to follow in his footsteps. 

I'm not defending him or the things he has done in any sense. All I'm saying
is lets be fair. Judge the man by the facts, not the headlines.

Try substituting "tanks" for "DES implementations".  There are many manufac-

Should the US therefore be willing to export tanks to anyone who wants them?

One can certainly criticise the export controls that now exist for being
poorly stated, or ineffective, or any of a variety of other things.  Certainly
the way they ARE stated can make them look very silly.  But it bothers me to
see a complete unwillingness to understand that there is a real, underlying
issue here.

Suppose the US manufactured military radios containing very strong encryption
technology.  Should we be willing to sell those to anyone who wanted them?

Suppose the basic technology for the radios was readily available, but the
encryption chips that made the radios used secret technology.  Should we sell
the encryption chips to anyone who asks?  If your answer to this question
is different from the previous one, can you explain why?

Now suppose the algorithms of the encryption chips were public knowledge, but
actually implementating them as chips with sufficient speed, reliability, low
power consumption, whatever, was very hard.  Does your answer change?

Lines are hard to draw.  But laws require them to be drawn.

It is not silly if you believe your self to be required by law to
keep track of every instance.

DES is not excluded from export.  However, it must be licensed.  It
is easy to get a license for DES in hardware.  It is easy to get a
license for a one-way implementation of DES in software.  It may be
possible to get a license to export a reversible version of the DES
in software provided that it is so embedded in an application that it
cannot be used to encrypt an arbitrary file or msessage.  It is
practically impossible to get a license to export a software
implementation of a general purpose and revesible verion of DES (or
indeed any other algorithm for that matter.)
 
Such implementations have the potential for turning any mini or micro
into a crypto engine.  This might fill the ether with traffic that
cannot be readily recognized, raising the cost of signals
intelligence gathering.
 
>What makes DES written here so secret when the one written in Finland
>(acc. a recent posting) isn't??????
 
The issue is not secrecy; it is replicability.  Note that hardware
implementations cannot be easily copied or modified.  If you can keep
track of the incidents of hardware, but would have more difficulty in
keeping track of copies of software, then you might be interested in
discouraging software.  If the work factor for reading the DES was N,
but that of reading a variant is >N then one might be motivated to
discourage variants.
 
>We're locking the barn door -- with the horse inside -- but after the

One does what one can do.  This is particularly true if one believes
oneself to be mandated by law to do so.
 
These observations are based upon many years of observing this issue.
While I have often discussed them in front of officers of the NSA,
they have never commented on them.  Neither have they ever attempted
in any way to influence me.  I suspect that the area is classified
and that they are unable to confirm or deny.
 
I am not now, have never been, and do not ever expect to be an agent

One of the first rules of cryptography is to assume that the "opposition"

I have noticed that reporters and local security officials have
the ability to trace auto license plates. Does anyone know how this
is done? Seems unlikely that they call up the local police department and
ask because anyone could do that! What is the probability that a common

freeway via his license number and then proceed to visit him (or her) in

How about having both algorithms available for a "real short" time and do
this with them:

	if (strcmp(new_crypt(reply ,salt),pass) == 0) {
		/* all is ok, let 'em in */
	}
	else if (strcmp(crypt(reply, salt), pass) == 0) {
		new_version_pass = new_crypt(reply,salt);
		/* update the passwd file */
		/* let 'em in */
	}
	else {
		/* password was no good, do whatever */
	}

After all of your users have logged in at least once, you then have all of
their passwords converted to the new algorithm without ever knowing what
their password is/was and the user will not know that anything was done
to the encryption algorithm for logging in.

Subj:	[1198] Re: password security

Assuming you could keep the binary secure, isn't there always the old
argument that you should not base the security of a crypto system on the
secrecy of the algorithm, in general?

"GOOD" ciphers are hard to design; the average person doesn't just come
up with a new one overnight.  Once you figure yours has sufficiently
leaked out, you'll have to design another one; EACH time.  

The NSA seems willing to do this (with the new crypto systems), but
I would think the algorithm secrecy exists more as an added nuisance
than a requirement.  They must figure it can't stay secret for very
long.

What about sticking with the current crypt, but just change the
constant.  Now you only have to keep a single number secret, and you can
afford to change it very often.

Further, using the scheme mentioned earlier, the login could recognize
both the old and new crypt constant.  Couldn't it then simply generate
the new crypt'd password when it needs to (or is this too dangerous?)?

There are cheap low-tech ways to make an envelope really tamper-resistant--
or to make tampering obvious.  Easiest is to enclose the item in question in
aluminum foil before you put it into the envelope.  

Also, you can enclose the whole envelope in two clear sheets of contact
paper.  For a #10 envelope, cut two sheets about 4" by 10", peel the
backing off, place the envelope on one, cover with the other, and leaving
about 1/2 to 1" of contact paper around the edges of the envelope, trim the
contact paper edges to be even to make it difficult to get a grip on a single
sheet.  If someone tries to remove it it is pretty obvious.  Putting a
signature on the envelope (as suggested in an earlier posting?) helps you
detect an attempt to substitue a new envelope for the damaged one.

I think you have this backwards. In no place I have worked has there been any
security protecting the contents of people's offices from such intrusion, at
least below management levels. In school, however, personal security is taken
much more seriously. Every TA and advisor has a lock on their door, lockers
for students are available in most buildings, etc...

Security in computer systems at the typical commercial/industry site is mainly
to (1) keep intruders out, and (2) keep people from accidentally damaging each
others files. And both of these are useful features.

However, you have effectively quadrupled your chances for an

At this point, you've already given one away.  Now the world knows
that the account "radish" is a root account.  One can also assume that
"root" still exists.  Knowing that "root vegetables" were used to name
the other accounts, guesses can be made as to the other account
names.  Even if they weren't root accounts, it's still a basis to
start from...

While it may have improved internal security a bit (though I can't
actually see how), you've statistically increased your opportunities
for a damaging forced entry.  Four accounts with four passwords
doesn't really do anything to improve your security.  Without knowing
anything about your internal specifics, I'd personally say you've
damaged it...

trying to understand what the item is and how it fits into their

US and internationally, and most of them needed to see the insides 
of it, since the X-rays did nothing to help my case (the damned things
look so much like a bomb when you X-ray them it is not funny). From the
viewpoint of the security people this thing was:

  1. a large container with lights and switches that could hold enough 
     explosives to blow the whole airport up.

[after x-ray]
  2. a large container with lights and switches that contains battery 
     looking things, wires, explosive looking things, more wires, etc.

  3. a large frame with lights, switches, capacitors, wires, a roll of 
     paper, circut cards, more waires, but no sign of anything that

> this could be good if you are a chronic loser of keys...

Well if that is the case, then investigate the Schlage Key-n-Keyless entry
deadbolt/doorknob combination.  Basically this is a set up that uses an
electronic circuit to all you to unlock the deadbolt AND the doorknob locks
without a key, or with the key if you have it.

When you leave the room/apt/whatever, you press a button, open the door and
after closing the door, you turn what is normally the security sheath (rim)
around the deadbolt cylinder to the right....this locks the deadbolt, and away
you walk.

upon returning, you turn the door knob until the led display (just one 1/4"
number only) lights up.  Then via a combination of left and right turns of
the door knob you enter the combination.  If you do it right, a "U" shows
up in the display, the thing beeps, and you can turn the security sheath
of the deadbolt to the left, thereby unlocking the deadbolt.  Then you use
the door knob normally and enter in.

Several problems with this lock are:
   1) the whole thing is made of that crappy cheapo metalic ABS plastic and
       one good whack with a sledgehammer would take it right off the door.
       (although the deadbolt cylinder, door knob appear to be normal metal)

    2) If the batteries die, and you dont have the key, then you have to
       either call a locksmith to pick it open for you or you have to do it...

    3) I dont like the idea of having to push a button when I leave a room
       this should be automatic...

Basically this lock would be good for closets, storerooms, etc,, where what's
wants something flashier than a sentex pushbutton lock...

>Try substituting "tanks" for "DES implementations".

There is a fundamental difference.  Tanks can obviously be used to
assault you, to violate rights of individuals on a large scale.
Effective encryption technology could be used to prevent your
eavesdropping, to protect the rights of persons communicating.
I see no way to claim that NSA or anyone else has a "right" to
be able to snoop on other people's conversations.  I don't dispute
that such snooping can produce useful information, but it is not
information to which we are in principle entitled.

As much as I love cryptanalysis, I would welcome a world in which
people can be sure their communications are secure against snoops.

Sorry -- this argument doesn't wash.

Weapons and weapons systems, like tanks, derive military value from things
like the materials with which they're made, the workmanship used, ....
Sometimes there's value added in the add-on electronic packages.  In all of
these cases, posession of the physical object implies military value.
Therefore, sale and delivery of the object constitutes increasing the military
strength of the recipient.

An encryption device has only a trivial value by way of its parts.  (eg.,
there was a sliding alphabet device during WW-II which had particular value
because it was made of materials which didn't warp aboard ship in the
South Pacific.)

The real military value of an encryption device -- that which kills people
or saves them from being killed -- is the algorithm itself and devices or
algorithms for breaking it.

In the case of DES, the algorithm is already known.  No one is trying to sell
machinery for breaking it.  It's possible to buy implementations from overseas
so there's no secrecy to protect, either with the algorithm or with how to
implement it.

So, what does the Government gain by interfering with its export?

All I can see being accomplished is the inhibition of a small piece of
potential export trade which could have been working against the trade
deficit.

Subj:	[2238] Re: DES Export Laws

> Try substituting "tanks" for "DES implementations".

    This is not a valid analogy.  Once you have one copy of a DES algorithm,
then it is easy to create as many as you like; the same is not true of
military hardware.  Therefore, even if your enemy has a given number of
tanks, or of guns or whatever, it is still in your interest not to give him
any more.  With software, he only needs to buy or steal one, so if you are
going to try to prevent the DES falling into the 'wrong hands', that
security must be complete:

1.  If the software is on open sale in the US, then you may as well sell
it in Moscow too - at least that way, they might pay for it instead of
buying one copy in the US and pirating the rest.  There is certainly no
point in banning it from NATO or neutral countries.

2.  If you really want to stop the Russians getting hold of it, then you
need strict regulations in the US as well - but if this was effective you
would probably have had to prevent any commercial use of the product and
restrict it to government agencies only.

3.  Even if you did this, it would only be a matter of time before any
hostile government was able to steal a copy; indeed, I would be surprised
if the Russians are not capable of writing their own DES code.

    Fast DES chips are a very different matter: though it can undoubtedly
be done, copying chips is not a trivial undertaking.  The issues at stake
are therefore essentially identical to those governing the sale of CPUs
or complete computers.  Software and hardware pose very different problems,
and just because they both relate to the DES they should not be confused.

I say that in that case, if the implementation was done at the Government's
request (eg., as part of a defense contract), then they can legitimately lay
claim to rights over that implementation.  However, if the implementation was
done by a private firm strictly on its own money and for the intention of
shipping product overseas, then it's none of the Government's business!
This is a free market economy we keep bragging about, right?

Let's make it stickier.

Suppose the algorithm is not in a chip.  It's software on a plain vanilla
computer.

Let's pretend that it's MY software -- and let's also pretend that I'm the
best programmer in the world.  Therefore, even though this is just software
and anyone could have written it, I happen to be the person who wrote it
the best.

I want to profit from my ability.  I want to sell copies of this superior
software.

I'm not picky.  If the U.S.Government wants to buy some copies, I'll sell them
some copies.  However, I won't sell them exclusive rights to ths software
unless they're willing to pay a VERY high price -- to compensate me for
the profit I won't be able to make from other customers.

Will they sign an exclusive contract and pay that very high price?

(I'll wait while you stop laughing.)

Well, no, not exactly.  What they'll do is make it illegal for me to sell
this software outside the U.S. and although they'll allow me to sell and
ship it within the U.S., they won't buy any copies from me for themselves.

--- and I repeat -- with encryption algorithms, the quality of the
implementation doesn't add to the quality of the secrecy (and therefore
the military value), but it might add to the satisfaction of the user
and therefore to the financial incentive for me to do a good job in the
implementation.  Killing that financial incentive has only one logical
justification -- to keep me out of the business and therefore keep a
near monopoly in the hands of the NSA and select defense contractors.

Don't lose sight of the fact that DES represents ONLY commercial level
crypto. Anybody sending something REALLY important wouldn't use DES
anyway (gov't/mil). The fact that it is illegal, won't stop the bad
guys from smuggling out almost anything they want. In fact is mostly
stops the law abiding citizens of the world from getting the protection
they need to run their businesses (or at least getting it from the USA -
but then NSA doesn't care about the balance of payments gap).

>The issue is not secrecy; it is replicability. ...

But given the fact that in an open marketplace with published alorithms,
one finds that other solutions will be provided sooner or later. If NSA
was really smart, they might have written public domain standard code
then freely distributed it in object form to cut down on the variants -
by all means protect the source code with export controls.

I agree that the law is there, but SHOULD it be there?  I really think
it boils down to pig-headedness in the security services. At least the
US delegation to the ISO Crypto standards stuff abstained rather than
vetoing DES (as NSA and the White House wanted them to, or at least
that is what I heard...).

At least NSA got smarter with the newer algorithms - and kept them
classified. Then they were looking for something a bit better than
commercial level protection.

This is probably beyond the bounds of reasonable paranoia, but you should
be aware that the standard technique for removing a document from a sealed
envelope is to insert a slotted rod at the corner, roll the contents onto
the rod, and slip it out as a thin tube.  Of course it's reinserted by
reversing the process.  Thus, the corners of the envelope need special

sociopath.  Most of the times he gained access to systems he did so not
with computer expertise, but by conning the owners into giving him the
needed passwords.  That ability to inspire trust, combined with the
conscienceless willingness to abuse it, is a classic symptom of
sociopathy.  It has nothing to do with computer expertise.

If he didn't know anything about computers Mitnick would probably be an
embezzler or a used car salescritter.  I suspect society will be much
better off with him isolated and neutralized (and that should keep me
off the jury, at least).

I'm not sure I understood this right, but in Finland we have
ABLOY locks with a keyhole on the outside and a small flat knob
(not the round American type) on the outside. Towards the frame
there is a small triangular piece that is pressed in by the frame
and a larger (1 x 3 x 1,5 cm) rectangular piece that locks the
door. You open the door from outside by twisting the key 180
degrees and pulling and lock it by pushing the door close. 

When the larger piece is out, you can pull it back in by twisting
the knob or the key, but not by pushing it. 

There are some variations of the theme, but basically you can not
open a lock of this type in the traditional "movie style", with a
credit card or something like that.

In Finland ABLOY has a major share of the lock market, and they
are considered to be most secure. They are not completely secure,
apparently somebody has found a way to open one. There was
something about it in the papers some time ago.

In the door of my apartment I have two locks.  For normal use I
have an ABLOY so that I can just push the door shut when I leave.
When I am away for a longer time I use a German Zeiss Icon
security lock that has to be shut with a key.  This is a rather
common practice in Finland.

One thing that I always have wonderer in the states is the
practice of having _round_ knobs on doors. If the lock is tight,
they are really awful to turn. In Finlad we have usually decent
handles, that you can turn. Much more easier.

Subj:	[690] locks

The very best kind of lock you can get is a Warehouse lock.  I'm sure you've
seen these before --- the one example in a movie I can think of was in the 
movie FX (the stuntman had one on his front door).

Basically, it's a cylinder in the middle of the door, which turns a disc, which
throws two deadbolts, one on either side of the door.  Some variants throw
four deadbolts, one up and one down.  You can't jimmy this, obviously.

On the other hand, I have friends who had very good burglar alarms on their
house.  Doors, windows.  Didn't matter.  The theives came in through the 
walls.  Like, with chain saws.  (They were after the art and Jewelry; looked
like an inside job.)

After several years of stagnation, we have again become interested
in hiring a person in charge of security. Since we will only be
hiring one person, this person will (gasp) have to handle ALL aspects
of security at all levels, from micros to mainframes. My question is
not with how to accomplish this, but one of where to place such a
person organizationally. I've read the textbooks, but I'd like to
hear from any of you who have a person in charge of security - to
whom does he/she report and what are the goods and bads of your
reporting line of authority? Thanks.

Note the explanation in the original article for choosing "root

users were logged in.

I agree that we have increased the chances for outside entry into our
system.  However, most of the "experts" I've heard from or read about
state the biggest danger is from inside jobs.  We have improved
internal security by providing more accountability for actions taken
with root permissions e.g. "Who modified that system file?".

Also, as stated in the original article, the "one account,
one-person-knows-password" rule was passed down from Higher
Authorities.  Perhaps this last point illustrates an old idea -
set up a rule (law), and someone will comply with the letter of the
rule while violating the objective (spirit).

Subj:	[1318] consensus on locks

Folks:

  A consensus on locks?  Doubt it.  The locksmith I deal with likes Medecos
best.  He also deals in Abloy, but not Sargeant KESO or any other high
security locks.

  He claimed that for virtually all applications, Medeco was superior to Abloy.
Abloy is harder to pick.  However, according to this one locksmith, Abloy locks
don't wear well.  If they are not treated gently, they will begin to jam.  Have
people discovered this to be true?  (Note: Abloy is more expensive than Medeco,
but Abloy keys cannot be duplicated at the shop as a standard Medeco can.  The
"Platinum," or biaxial, Medecos are in the same boat as the Abloy.)

  As an earlier posting noted, a great cylinder isn't worth much if attached to
a bad lock.  And a great lock won't help if attached to a cheap frame.  Our
company is installing a Medeco D10 (7.5 lbs. of nasty looking metal) drop bolt
onto a steel door inside a steel frame held up by steel reinforced studs.  That
should keep all but a few determined hacks out.

*I don't know about a consensus on pick-proof, but I've been burglarized
*3 times in 3 different locations.  In 2 cases the door was jimmied; in the
*3rd, the door and the jamb were found in toto on my living room rug.

Kevin -

Speaking as one who has been in the fields of both security and law
enforcement, I would say that you are one individual in sore need of a 
strange electrical device called a burglar alarm.  Most models work with
*any* type of lock on the door.

I'm not trying to be sarcastic, but I used to live in the "big city" (New
Orleans, to be exact), and I know what it's like to be a crime victim.
The only advice I have for you is to "up the ante" - try new security methods
out, like an alarm.

Here are some other things that may work.  If you don't have any small children
around, get a dog.  Pit bulls are still the rage, but I prefer rottweilers
myself.  Also, check your local laws to see if there are any homemade
"passive" booby traps you can lay out to surprise the unexpected visitor.
Many of these will deter them from returning.

Of course, no method of security will work unless you use it properly.  The
last time my house in N.O. was burglarized was in broad daylight, while I was
in court.  I came home to find that the alarm had not been set, and that the
kitchen window had been left open.  My ex-wife left it that way because she
"thought that no one could get through that 'tiny' opening".  They got away
with a TV, stereo, and my service revolver.

If the city still gets to be too much for you, look around for a small town
nearby where you feel comfortable and from which you can commute, and by all
means, move!  I now live in a small town in the northwest.  My door is
unlocked at night, and I usually leave my keys in the car when I get home.
I've been there three years, and have yet to be mugged, burglarized, or
threatened in any manner.

Above all, DON'T GIVE UP!  As they say, no one can walk over you without
your permission.  In the meantime, pray for peace of mind - you need some.

Ok. First: Excuse mz bad english, but i have problems with natural languages
like English and Spanish. Could we speak in Assembler or C ? :-)

Let's start: My name is Frank Simon (called Terra), student of computer
science in Oldenburg(West Germany), i am running a BBS (Chaos Mailbox System)
on Bitnet (107633@DOLUNI1), and i am one of the seven ppl who build the
leading/council/presidium (oh i don't know the word ...) of the Chaos
Computer Club in Hamburg (West-Germany).

The german PPT (Deutsche Bundespost (short: DBP)) start experimence with
ISDN for several years. Now it will install in germany in the next years.
We have thought about the possibilites and the danger of ISDN. Our
opinion is: We are against ISDN in this form in westgermany, because
 1) the DBP will save all communication datas (who called whom, on which
    service (phone,etc), how long , how much cost it,etc) for 80 days
    in 12 central computer centers in germany. We and the german Data
    Security People (i don't know the right word ... in germany we have
    for every country and for the state Data Security People. They are
    called by state to work.) are against the Saving of these (most
    don't need the DBP for there work) because it's against the Data
    Security Law.
 2) The DBP will integrate all Services until 1992 in one Network -
    IBFN - that means ... TV, Radio , Phoning, Computernetworks,a.s.o.
    are on ONE Network. Much Security Problem must be solut by the DBP
    for this, in exampe the Central Computer System who will manage all this
    functions. We don't ave a good opinion of the DBP. They don't have the
    Data Security and System Security at first place in there concepts.
 3) The function of ISDN give an goverment now and in future the possiblity
    the control there citizens. The government (or the secret services)
    can check every citizen, who contact he, what does he read in information
    retrieval systems, which channel he look in TV,and so on.
    The Solution is a complete Communication Picture on group of citizens
    or especialy one citizen.

Subj:	[7840] DES export laws

(The long turn-around for messages on the security list make this response a
pain to write.  I got several personal messages from people shortly after my
message appeared, and got involved in a couple of conversations.  Coming back
to all this two weeks later, repeating many of the same things, is a bit of a
bother.  Oh, well.)

[Moderator injection: Sorry, Jerry.  I do my best with the backlog *and* all
  the other real-life things I keep track of too.  But have you considered that
  you're feeling the need to repeat yourself because some readers didn't bother
  to absorb your original points in the first place?  Does that necessarily
  imply that restatement will change that?

  Further, I believe you're giving the readership less credit than they
  deserve for being able to restore the context of a discussion in their own
  minds.  If, of course, they were interested in the first place.  If they
  couldn't care less, they've probably already skipped this entire msg.
  There's a large, diverse audience out there...  _H*]

In the interests of keeping things to a reasonable length, I'm going to
summarize the comments I'm responding to.  If my summaries lose what the
writers were trying to get across, my apologies.  I'm sure they will speak
for themselves again....

Carl Ellison raises two distinct points:

	a)  The value of something like a tank is in the material, workman-
		ship, and so on.  Preventing physical export of such objects
		"keeps the value at home."  The value of an encryption algo-
		rithm is in the algorithm itself, and possibly in means of
		breaking it; an implementation is a minor gloss.

	b)  If he invents the algorithm, he claims that he has the right to
		sell it as he wishes - the government doesn't own it, and
		should have no say in what he chooses to do with it.  While
		he discusses the invention of an algorithm, presumably he
		intends the same argument to apply to a privately-developed
		implementation of a public algorithm.

I contest both points.  Point (a), a point several of my correspondents
raised as well, reveals a certain naivete concerning the ease or difficulty
of implementing software, and about what constitutes value in software.  The
fact of the matter is, people are willing to pay many thousands of dollars for
well-written, efficient software.  They are willing to do this because it is
NOT easy to produce such software.

Yes, it is quite true that having an efficient algorithm provides no addi-
tional security, in the sense that the output of the encryption is as secure
if it was done in a millisecond as if it was done in 10 seconds.  But that's
not the point:  Military (or commercial) usefulness of an encryption algo-
rithm requires a fairly high level of performance.

To pick current "bad boys", how many people in all of Libya or Iran do you
think there are who can implement a useful version of DES?

Remember, too, that I'm NOT arguing that the particular restrictions the US
has chosen to impose are "right".  All I'm arguing is that the PRINCIPLE that
it may be reasonable to restrict distribution of software makes perfect sense,
even software for algorithms that are public.  The fact that one can get DES
implementations from elsewhere is exactly equivalent to the fact that one can
get tanks from elsewhere:  It means that our restrictions may not end up being
very effective, but it doesn't mean that we should necessarily eliminate them.

There has been much written about how we are entering the "information age",
where value inheres in information, rather than in goods alone.  Here we have
a prime example!

At one time, it was easy to distinguish "military" from "civilian" items.  In
today's world, things are not so simple.  High-technology "goods" (which in-
cludes information and software) are usually capable of "dual use".  Is it
a pharmaceutical plant or a poison gas plant?  The machinery is identical in
both cases....

BTW, tanks these days contain a LOT of software in things like targetting
systems.  The underlying algorithms are pretty "public" - basic physics - but
the software itself is neither straightforward nor public.  You can't buy that
software on the open market either - even in the US....

As for (b):  Under US law, there are exactly two classes of things which are
"born classified":  Information about nuclear weapons, and information about
cryptography.  The US legal system has chosen to say that you do NOT have a
property right for this kind of information - it is considered too important
to national security.  You are, of course, free to disagree.  So far, the
courts have backed the government position, though the issue is pretty messy.

In any case, on this issue you don't even need to go nearly that far.  If I
independently develop the necessary technology for making nerve gas, without
any reference to government work on the matter, I STILL can't sell the stuff.
I can't sell drugs I invent without a license.  I can't sell guns.  I can't
even sell cars without meeting all sorts of government regulations first.

If you want to argue that the government should stay entirely out of trade,
you can certainly find some respectable economists and philosophers on your
side.  But the fact of the matter is that the US does not today have, and
never has had, complete "freedom of trade", whether national or internation-
ally.  Trying to use this non-existent freedom to justify a particular posi-
tion is is pointless.

Graham Shaw argues that there is no point restricting export of DES implemen-
tations because the Russians will have little trouble getting hold of an
implementation in the domestic market if they really want it.  Again, this
argument simply proves that it's difficult to enforce the restrictions; it
doesn't say that attempting to maintain them is wrong in principle.  Again,
it's quite clear that the NSA understands this:  First off, DES was deliber-
ately made hard to implement efficiently in software (that's the only con-
ceivable purpose for the initial and final permutations - they add no strength
to the algorithm); second, they saw to it that only a hardware implementation
could be certified; and finally for the "next generation" of encryption
algorithms they intend to provide ONLY tamper-proof hardware, with secret
algorithms.

Doug Gwyn distinguishes tanks from DES implementations by pointing out - with
images of Tienamen square clearly in front of him - that tanks, unlike cryp-
tographic technology, can be used to violate individual rights on a large
scale.  This is an interesting distinction, but let's see where it goes.  If
the Chinese democracy demonstrators had also had tanks, they might have been
able to defend themselves.  Absurd position?  A similar position is taken by
the NRA concerning gun regulation:  They love to point out that the first
thing a dictatorship does is seize all the weapons in the people's hands.  If
people are armed, it's not so easy to violate their rights.

Still find the argument silly?  Do you think an Afghan would agree with you on
that point?

Looking at the other side:  It's clear from information that makes it into the
public eye that much data about future terrorist plans is derived from inter-
cepted communication.  Does Abu Nidal have a right to secure communications
channels?  Gwyn's argument that information gained by "snooping", while valu-
able, "is not information to which we are in principle entitled", is remini-
scent of the line attributed to Stimson that "Gentleman don't read other gen-
tlemen's mail".  Gentlemen also don't hijack airliners or blow up civilians.
I, too, would prefer to live in a world of "gentlemen", but this world isn't
like that.  The rabbis had a saying:  Those who start out by being kind to the
cruel, end up being cruel to the kind.

Subj:	[1532] Encryption hardware/software available?

Please excuse me if you receive multiple copies of this note.  I am sending it
to several lists which may have a subscriber who has relevant information.

We are interested in providing an encrypting gateway for our campus network.
The idea is that users on certain LANs considered secure wish to send data
across an unsecured ethernet spine and eventually into another secure LAN or
host. We have several ideas for the gateway (based on previous software
developed at Yale) but would like to acquire a software or, preferably
hardware, encryptor.  Ideally, it would be a card with the ability to
encrypt/decrypt on its own chip rather than taking up workstation CPU cycles.
We would pass it data and a key and it would return encrypted data.  The
gateway is being built on an IBM PS/2.  Any leads would be very much
appreciated.

I also wonder if other sites are thinking about this problem and, if so, what
sort of solution are you looking at?  All of the security discussions which I
have seen are concerned with authorization and access control (such as dial
back) rather than encryption of data.  Does anyone know of a forum where this
has been discussed?  Note, by the way, that we are not planning to do any
research into encryption algorithms, a subject I am happy to leave to the
mathematicians.

Since I do not subscribe to ANY of the lists, please send replies directly to

There's another difference.  You can't carry tanks over in your
briefcase or buy the plans for them at B. Dalton's.  There's an
awful lot of published DES code, and various PC utilities (PCTOOLS,
for example) contain DES.  The only ones who are being deprived of

I don't think there is any way, other than to try and see a pattern.
If you don't find one, that doesn't mean there isn't one.  It might
just be too subtle for you to have noticed.

A good answer would take many k.  Most of the poor generators flunk
autocorrelation statistics, though.  That doesn't mean one that passes
is good.  How good is good enough, and what tests are necessary,
largely depend on what you intend to use it for.

like it much.  Not much substance, I beleive, was the gist of his complaints.
I have attended Computer Security Inst. annual conf. for the last 2 yrs and
hope to go again this year.   CSI annual conf. include a trade show which is
quite interesting and informative as well as a variety of sessions, videos, etc.

I have also attended a TOPIC conf (1987). TOPIC is/was CA's Top Secret users
conference.  We have TSS installed on our Amdahl (running MVS).
I dont think CA calls it TOPIC any more but they still have an annual conf.

p.s. where/what is OSU  ?

The sensitivity of the detectors seems to vary dependent on the 
whim of the aviation authority.  I would be willing to bet that were you 
to NOT deposit ALL metal articles in the basket when travelling
from an airport up here in W. Canada, 
the bells and whistles would go nuts. I have noticed a difference on the
last two trips I made recently to the US, in that what  sets the alarms off
at the Edmonton International, goes merrily undetected by the systems
in Washington, Minneapolis and Chicago.

It would seem that Transport Canada  perhaps requires a more sensitive setting
than the FAA in the US. examples : I have been asked to remove my wallet with
credit cards and try again; the foil in cigarette packages is enough to trigger
a response.

[Moderator tack-on: Someone also pointed out that any packaging foil, such
as that around Lifesavers, can trigger them.   _H*]

Ooog.

>It uses a hang up and call-back approach.
Yes, it does. Barely.

>What kind of terminal does it expect to see at the remote end?
It supports a lot of different terminals. The only one I've actually used with
it is a Data General Dasher 200. It *may* be able to use ANSI control. The only
file xfer protocol it supports is a proprietary one (can you say "big bucks"?
I knew you could), which only runs on IBM PCs (what, there are OTHER machines?)

It is not too great an emulator. You MIGHT be able to run RELAY through it, but
I don't think it supports Kermit. It runs in "half-ASCII duplex", meaning that
it does the character echoing, but doesn't allow type ahead, and locks you out
when it is repainting the screen. Its repainting is very poor; usually it
resends the whole blasted screen when you are using SPF. Don't know how well
it works with VM.

Summary recomendation: Security will love it. Your users will hate it (speaking
as a user).

This is strictly a safety issue.  Handles have been denigrated as a safety

to injure an eye on them. 

I do not know whether it materially increases safety, but I am sure someone

Automated fingerprint identification system
-------------------------------------------

        These systems are sold by:

        FINGERMATRIX Inc.

        Washington, DC Office: (703) 893-3880

        I have seen such a system in Katwijk, Holland.
        The Dutch security-firm 'Bavak en Jung' delivers
        those systems in Holland. It's a box with a keyboard
        and a sensor on which you place one of your fingers.
        Identification costs only a few seconds. To enhance
        performance PIN-codes can be used. In that case the
        system only compares fingerprints with the same
        PIN-code.

        After the security-operator has identified itself
        new persons can be registered by the system. To
        improve false rejection more fingers can be shown to
        the system. So if you loose one finger you can stil
        enter your office to get your spare finger!

        The system does not store a complete image of your
        fingerprints. It only stores certain unique points
        where fingerprint ridges end or divide, which are
        unique to each individual.

        Policemen have tried to fool the system with various
        artificial fingers made of rubber and plastic. They
        even tried to make the temperature and conduction
        equal to a human finger but no succes! They are
        still looking for volunteers who want to donate a
        real fresh cutoff finger..

        I have no affiliation what so ever with Fingerprint.

Light blue (also called non-reproducible blue) is difficult to copy.  It
is frequently used in graphic arts applications for outlines, etc.

Another method of identifying (but not preventing) copies is to do a half-tone
of the background color saying "COPY," which only appears when the item is
copied in black and white.  This is usually found on checks and other
negotiable documents.

Yes, it's a dark red and light black printing on it is almost illegible
unless you view it under a STRONG light.  The computer game "Werdna's

   Since we will only be
   hiring one person, this person will (gasp) have to handle ALL aspects
   of security at all levels, from micros to mainframes. My question is
   not with how to accomplish this, but one of where to place such a
   person organizationally.

Consider for a moment the range of tasks that a security officer
performs.  In general, their duties cover host security (with account
management figuring heavily), communications, building security,
personnell (most breaches are inside jobs after all), and just about
everything under the sun.  It therefore makes sense to place them in
some sort of "general administrative" group.

Unfortunately, the person in charge of that group probably does not
understand security.  Cheer up, no one else does, either (:-).

For confirmation, look to other organizations where security figures
prominently (e.g., banks).  I think you will find that they put
security in just such a general, but centrally-run division.

There are a few different things you can use to slow down enterprising
xerographers.  Red appears black to the black and white imaging systems
of most copying machines, so red paper makes it more difficult to copy.

Light blue does not copy well, so you could write with a light blue
felt tip.

If you are more concerned about the legitimacy of the document (as in
a check) as opposed to the value of the information on it, you could
take the same approach that the check vendors use.  It amounts to the
words VOID-COPY written in a half-tone screen of a solid color being
superimposed on a pastel background equating to the same color.
(Tough to explain, but easy to see with an example.)  Let's say
you have a check in front of you that has soft yellow stripes
running through it.  If you look closely, you will see bright yellow
dots (with white space) spelling out the word VOID.  Normally it
doesn't show, but the copying machine sees the bright yellow letters
and reproduces them, ignoring the pastel areas.  Examine some of
the checks and/or official documents you run into in the next
few weeks.

    The VAX KDC security management software

The EESS provides a number of security features for Ethernet/802.3 networks
including transmission of encrypted data between Ethernet devices over

We also have some software encryption products, but none run on OS/2.  If you
could use a VMS or Ultrix workstation (e.g., VAXstation 3100 or DECstation

There will be a case study article on using EESS products to enhance the

Subj:	[991] thumb scan devices

  I have seen a thumbscan in the kilobuck range made by, I believe,
ThumbScan Inc, probably in Cambridge, Ma. The version I saw was
attatched to a PC.
  They make a couple of other interesting security devices, one I
thought do be really clever is called the Gordian Knot. It is a
epoxy potted "thing" about the size of the average electronic
stopwatch with a photodetector and an LCD readout, and it self
destructs when it thinks someone is tampering with it.
  The idea was that the software would flash a spot on the screen
in a certain pattern, you would hold the device to the screen, it
would read the pattern being flashed, hash, trash, encrypt and
discombobulate it and hand back a number that the software would
already be expecting. Quite a bit more versatile than the IBM
label Medeco locks on the 3270 and infinately more clever. (I seem
to think they were about $14 in small quantity). They could also
be programmed (only once) to self destruct at a given time or just
expire.

Subj:	[1069] Another encryption software request

I have a need to keep some of my PC (IBM clone) data encrypted.
However, none of the encryption programs that I have tested to date
do what I want.  They all take an input file and encrypt it to
produce an output file.  All fine and good for the occasional file or
two. What I want to do is declare entire directories as encrypted and
have the encryption package automatically encrypt/decrypt any data in
these directories.

I know there are some full blown security packages that will do this,
along with multiple users/passwords, protected directories/files,
etc. But I'm not really interested in all of that and the associated
overhead. Simple physical security is good enough in this case, the
encryption is desired to protect only a small subset of the data in
the event the PC is stolen.

So, my question: Does anyone know of a package that will do what I
need? A full blown system that can be selectively installed would be
acceptable. (Note: This must be a software solution, there are no
expansion slots on the PC in question.)

Thanks in advance.

Subj:	[1122] Re: consensus on locks

About Abloy locks not wearing down well:
As is known, Abloys (originally) come from Finland.  Here they are the most
common type of locks.  I just recently had to have my apartment lock replaced
because it was so worn-out it was hard to get it to stay unlocked !  It had
been originally installed when the house was built, in 1962.  The lock still
opened the door very nicely, though.
Also, I personally changed the lock for my parent's front door - their house
was built circa 1955... the lock was still quite operational, but had the same
problem of not properly latching to the "unlocked" position.
How long do apartment locks (used several times daily) last, in general ?

Subj:	[1029] Re: "copy proof paper"

Defeating a "copy proof" paper based on paper color only is fairly
straightforward. You get a sheet of colored celluloid or the like and
place it in front of the item being copied. Look through the celluloid
and if you can't SEE the lettering, the copier generally won't either.
Our copier (one of the newer Xerox models) has sufficient contrast
adjustments that the quality of the copy can nevertheless be made most
adequate. The same trick can be used if you want to duplicate the
red "proof" photos some photographers use. A useful fact is that a
CuSO4 solution (copper sulphate) of reasonable density will filter
out ALL red light (down to the sub 1 photon level; it's used to
filter lasers and select second harmonic radiation!). Use a small
bit as a filter & contact print the pic onto roll film...voila!
Your very own negative! (This is a major pain in the neck to do and
should not become a habit...the poor photog. has to make a living,
after all. The filtering technique is occasionally useful though.)

Several millions of Abloys are in use here in Finland, many of them decades
old. The weather conditions aren't exactly 'gentle' here.  The Abloy has a
very simple but efficient design with a minimal number of moving parts. The
manufacturer recommends lubrication with thin oil now and then (just a few
drops into the keyhole), and that should keep it working.

There are also several variants of Abloy, with different levels of availability
of key blanks and duplication service.

locks), except that I have been using Abloys all my life. (well, almost)

I've recently run across a device which suits this purpose well.

The FasTok box is a combination encryptor/compressor.

Its normal configuration is as an active modem cable, plugging in
between the computer and the modem, at both ends. It is transparent
to both the computer, and the modem.

It both encrypts and compresses. The quoted compression ratios were
in the 2 to 5 times range.

I have no connection with the manufacturer, other than friendship.
However, I will relay questions to and from the net if there is an
interest.

There's been a rumor floating around on the net that the Soviets have
cracked DES, and published that fact in one of their academic journals.
Apart from the implausibility of that, Don Mitchell did a fairly thorough
literature search, with the aid of a Russian-speaking reference librarian,
and found nothing.

Now -- for certain badly-chosen keys, that isn't out of the question.
There are 4 "weak keys" -- 01010101 01010101, FEFEFEFE FEFEFEFE,
1F1F1F1F 0E0E0E0E, E0E0E0E0 F1F1F1F1 -- which should be avoided.
There are also a set of "semi-weak keys" which present a smaller
security risk.  All of these should be avoided in critical situations,
i.e., master keys used to encrypt session keys.  See Davies and Price,
"Security for Computer Networks", for details.

Subj:	[2697] DES and the Soviets

I have seen a reference to a Soviet article about DES, but
no one has ever been able to provide me with enough information
to track the article down.  I am prepared to dismiss it as
a myth, until someone puts a real reference here.

While the question of export control (of DES, and of other things)
is certainly of great interest, the issues are wildly complex
and not going to be solved here.  However, here are some comments
on some stuff people have said:

Just because something appears on Usenet doesn't mean that it
has made it to the USSR.  And just because it has made it to one
or two folks there, doesn't mean that there is broad distribution.
The USSR is just like the US.  A piece of technology may be well
embedded in a particular department or office, or even a whole
building, but it is unlikely to spread quickly around the country,
or even across the hall.  Communications are heavily stifled.
There is no concept of BBS/Usenet in the Soviet Union---the
people who have access to Western databases number less than 100.
I'm not saying that DES restriction is bad/good; what I am saying
is that Dr. Dobbs is not widely read in the Soviet Union.  A $40
subscription to Dr. Dobbs is 80 days pay for the average Soviet
(because Dr. Dobbs doesn't take Rubles).  The argument that ``this
is everywhere in the US public domain'' has no relevance when
extended to the USSR.

When the argument is made that ``the spies/terrorists have whatever
they want,'' that is also not very valid.  This argument is used
quite often by Soviet academics we meet to explain why the US should
sell computers to the Soviets.  In fact, the unstated policy of US
export controls is to keep the Enemy (you know, the dark empire)
in bare feet and technological illiteracy.  What do you think the
military industrial complex depends on?  Answer: the research done
everywhere else in the country.  Whether we admit it or not, the
policies that DoD promotes through Commerce (note that DoD, Commerce,
and the Businesses-that-want-to-make-a-profit form three legs of
a triangle that is in eternal conflict.  DoD would have them in
the stone age, while Business wants to increase exports and make our
economy stronger) are aimed at restricting technology EVERYWHERE
in the country.

So, you can fight that particular policy, but you can't use a rational
argument, since the policy isn't there for rational reasons (well,
let's just say not for reasons that are entirely above board).

No kidding! I was working for a computer game manufacturer a year or so ago,

Well, as a promotional gift, we had some practice HAND GRENADES stenciled w/

Int'l to John Wayne Int'l (Orange Co. CA.) with a plane change inbetween with
my mock explosive brief- case as carry on! This meant two different scannings
that failed to turn up something which should have a pretty blatent signature.
The next day when I noticed what I had gotten away with, I was pleased that I
hadn't been pulled aside for questioning, or inadvertantly shot for someone
too nasty to be dealt with nicely, but it didn't take too long for me to
realize that I might feel a little safer in the future if I had been stopped.

I wonder if Jim is using the attribute 'fairly old' to put down

there seem to be better codes around, but if one wants DES, then it should
not probably matter how old the implementation is, as long as it's DES. S in
DES is for Standard. A 'brand new DES' probably should not be called DES
anymore. Is Jim using 'DES' as a generic term? I'm all confused.

MOTOROLA GEG DEVELOPS SECURITY SYSTEM
FOR PROTECTION OF LOCAL AREA NETWORKS (LANS)

Motorola Government Equipment Group (GEG) has introduced its Network
Encryption System (NES), which features the latest in security services
for the protection of Local Area Networks (LANs).  Designed in
accordance with Secure Data Network System (SDNS) standards including
SDNS electronic key management, the NES is a flexible internet security
solution for Type I applications.

The NES is unique in COMSEC technology because the protocol software is
loaded via diskette.  The NES is installed in the drop cable between the
computer and the transceiver, or as a gateway device separating a LAN
from a backbone network.  The product supports both DoD and ISO internet
standards allowing protection over wide area networks.

The initial product accommodates connection to IEEE 802.3 and IEEE 802.4
medias.  Motorola Inc. has a Memorandum of Agreement with the National
Security Agency and anticipates product endorsement in the first quarter
of next year.  The LAN product represents the first of a family of SDNS
products that will provide complete, interoperable system security
solutions.  Additional information on the NES can be obtained
from Joe Marino at (602) 441-5827.

Subj:	[1126] Looking for: SNA Session-level encryption hardware/software.

Apologies in advance if this query is not appropriate to this group. I have
tried comp.protocols.ibm and comp.protocols.misc to no avail. Here goes ...

I am looking for either commercial or public-domain software implementing
SNA secondary-logical unit (SLU) LU0 protocol using process-based encryption.
Usually, the actual encryption is performed with hardware assistance. If
necessary, I am willing to integrate one vendor's LU0 product with the
encryption support available from another source. I have already done this
under MS-DOS using my own SNA/LU0 software.

My preference is for a SYSV-compatable product running on the NCR Tower series
including the 32/200. However, ANY pointers to hardware/software source are
appreciated.

Please respond by EMAIL and, if the volume is sufficient, I will summarize
later.

						Thanks,

						Bill

Subj:	[4494] Personal Health Security System

Radio Netherlands International, Saturday, 12 August 1989, 
will have more on this:
----
The objective of the research is to develop a Personal Health Security System. 
The term "personal" is used because the system is based on a card that can be 
carried by the person at all times. Security is enhanced by requiring entry of 
a secret code prior to operation. Computer-chip-based money cards use a 
similar technology. 

The term "personal" is also used to indicate that the system is designed to 
protect the right of users to control their own health records. This is 
particularly important when persons may be discriminated against because of 
their health status, or when sensitive personal information is to be stored. 
If health records are not stored because of inadequate data security, then 
people's exposure to infectious agents can not be effectively controlled. 

The term "health" is used because the card would store not only medical 
records, but also behavioral information. Also, our strategy for health 
maintenance includes social support as well as medical support.

We use the term "security" to indicate that the objective is protecting and 
securing the health of the user, and to indicate that information security is 
a key feature of the system. Both physical and cryptographic security 
techniques are used to protect data. Cryptography is used to build information 
exchange procedures that permit both privacy and anonymity to be preserved.

The term "system" is used because the health card, like a telephone, is only 
useful if there are other similar devices to exchange information with, and 
because both human and machine elements must act in coordination if the 
benefits are to be obtained. Finally, a system view, that considers the 
interaction of all system elements and the benefits to every person is 
necessary to ensure proper function. 

Recently, we have seen examples of what can happen when system wide effects 
are not considered. In one case, the number of persons donating blood in a 
city in Sweden increased sharply. Apparently people were using blood donor 
pins as evidence that they were in good health when meeting others at dance 
halls. Of course, since a person could acquire an infection after giving 
blood, or even use someone else's pin, there was no real security. 

The authorized user of a health card, and only the authorized user, could at 
any time cause the card to issue an up-to-date health certificate. It could 
also read and validate a certificate issued by another's card. The validation 
might be an unforgeable digital signature from a medical doctor on the 
certificate. Furthermore, ones health card could be programmed to 
automatically exchange certificates with another person's card. The purpose of 
exchanging certificates would be to evaluate infection risk from transfer of 
bodily fluids. Such transfers accompany sexual activities, and blood and 
tissue donation. A small display on the card could show the results of the 
evaluation. The certificates issued could not be used to identify or trace the 
card user. Furthermore, a privacy preserving procedure ensures that sensitive 
information is only released when needed, that is, when the automated 
negotiation process indicates that the interaction will take place. These 
exchange procedures can be thought of as generating informational barriers 
that prevent transmission of infectious agents.

I while ago, John Gilmore posted a DES implementation on news.
I took it, and compiled it using MS C 3.0 (which should tell you when
approximately it was).
I made it much faster by pre-computing everything that could be
pre-computed and using table lookups. Unfortunately, I have no idea
where I put it later.

Hi Jim,
 
you can get a DES software implementation for PC/AT's from
BrainON!, Schulstrasse 10, D-6925 Eschelbronn, West-Germany
for approx. $140 plus shipping. On a 20MHz-386 (my computer)
it en/decrypts about 8510 bytes/sec - quite good I think.
All the best to you,

Hi Jim, if you are still looking for a DES program for a PC, I have
one that I will sell for $30.  I wrote it about two years ago but
never found a market for it.  It is small (about 30K if I remember
correctly) and will do a full encryption cycle in about 10 milliseconds
on an AT.  That's faster than any other DES program I've seen for a
PC (including IBM's assembler code that runs inside of automated
teller machines).

If you are interested, send e-mail back and I'll give you more details.

In the case of blue printing one has only to place a yellow filter

The yellow dye in yellow view graph transparency film is usually
satisfactory to bring the print out. This will not make a good looking

Subj:	[1146] Dongles are still alive

Some time ago, there was a discussion on "dongles" on this list.  The
general impression was that dongles were a poor idea and nobody really
was serious about them (at least that's my recollection).  FYI a dongle
is a physical device, plugged into a PC's parallel printer port as an
example.  The software looks for the dongle and refuses to work if it
is not there.

While at SIGGRAPH last week in Boston, there was a company called Rainbow
Technologies showing off their "Software Sentinel" "revenue protection
system."  It is a small device that plugs into the PC's parallel printer
port (and passes through), and since they were selling it as a development
tool, includes software drivers for many languages.  Older dongles were
simply made up of a specific wiring, or perhaps even a ROM.  The newer
ones appear to include a chip that may even do encryption.  Their flier
says it "Uses highly-secure algorithm technique" and "all voltages are
supplied by the computer or optional printer."  I asked for more info
which they will mail me, but in the meantime wanted to point out the
dongle is not yet dead.  Anyone already know more details?

Subj:	[1189] Re: traps

>He got fed up and wired the place with wall current.
>Someone came in and fell into his trap and was electrocuted.

You may be refering to what happened in the Overtown section of Miami a few
years ago. I can't remember the store owner's name, but what happened was
that people were breaking into his store through a hole in the roof. He placed
a section of chain-link fence across the hole but a few feet below it, so
if a person was to enter the hole he would be almost entirely inside before
he made contact. This he hooked up to the AC in his store.
 
Sure enough, someone did enter and was electrocuted by the device. I remember
there being a big debate in the Miami area over the actions of this man, with
most people siding WITH him. When it finally did come before the grand jury,
they refused to indict the store owner for murder, and he was convicted of a
much lesser charge (like an illegal security device or something . . ) and
as far as I know he is still in business.

Subj:	[2025] AT&T_Alarms

In response to many inquiries about BURGLAR ALARMS,

AT&T has entered this market with their new WIRELESS SYSTEM
(AT&T SECURITY SYSTEM 8000).

CASTLE ALARMS PLUS, INC is the AT&T Authorized Dealer in the
Southern New Hampshire area.
They can be reached at (603) 898-9851 or
                       (800) CAP-2580 outside NH.

Over the past few years, I have built my own house and
had an excellent alarm system wired into it for
BURGLAR, FIRE, and SMOKE protection.
In the course of building my own home, I
researched every type of home security system
on the market.  These included all the features imaginable
(Passive Infra-Red motion detectors, microwave motion detectors,
shock detectors for pre-entry warning,
pressure sensitive mats, smoke alarms (photoelectric
and ionization), magnetic contact switches for doors and windows,
delayed entry features, medical alert, digital communicators
for automatically dialing authorities, etc....)

However, the new WIRELESS SYSTEMS
on the market today have all of the same features
as the above wired systems, AND MORE!
A WIRELESS ALARM SYSTEM has the added benefit that
the entire system can be taken with you, should you decide
to move.

In fact, the AT&T WIRELESS SYSTEM (AT&T SECURITY SYSTEM 8000)
utilizes the latest RF technology extending
it beyond the capabilities of wired systems
and has features OVER AND ABOVE other wireless systems.
This modular system can incorporate BURGLAR, FIRE, SMOKE, MEDICAL,
and ENVIRONMENTAL protection.

CASTLE ALARMS PLUS, INC is the AT&T Authorized Dealer in the area.
They can be reached at (603) 898-9851 or
                       (800) CAP-2580 outside NH.

They come highly recommended and can engineer a system
that's tailored to your needs,
at a very REASONABLE PRICE and RELIABLE SERVICE
with your interests in mind.
They may even offer financing and I heard they
may offer a discount to AT&T employees or
free Alarm Monitoring for the first year
(about a $240 value)!

I hope this information helps you "make the right choice".

Subj:	[4369] CERT Internet Security Advisory

Many computers connected to the Internet have recently experienced
unauthorized system activity.  Investigation shows that the activity
has occurred for several months and is spreading.  Several UNIX
computers have had their "telnet" programs illicitly replaced with
versions of "telnet" which log outgoing login sessions (including
usernames and passwords to remote systems).  It appears that access
has been gained to many of the machines which have appeared in some of
these session logs.  (As a first step, frequent telnet users should
change their passwords immediately.)  While there is no cause for
panic, there are a number of things that system administrators can do
to detect whether the security on their machines has been compromised
using this approach and to tighten security on their systems where
necessary.  At a minimum, all UNIX site administrators should do the
following:

o Test telnet for unauthorized changes by using the UNIX "strings"
  command to search for path/filenames of possible log files.  Affected
  sites have noticed that their telnet programs were logging information
  in user accounts under directory names such as "..." and ".mail".

In general, we suggest that site administrators be attentive to
configuration management issues.  These include the following:

o Test authenticity of critical programs - Any program with access to
  the network (e.g., the TCP/IP suite) or with access to usernames and
  passwords should be periodically tested for unauthorized changes.
  Such a test can be done by comparing checksums of on-line copies of
  these programs to checksums of original copies.  (Checksums can be
  calculated with the UNIX "sum" command.)  Alternatively, these
  programs can be periodically reloaded from original tapes.

o Privileged programs - Programs that grant privileges to users (e.g.,
  setuid root programs/shells in UNIX) can be exploited to gain
  unrestricted access to systems.  System administrators should watch
  for such programs being placed in places such as /tmp and /usr/tmp (on
  UNIX systems).  A common malicious practice is to place a setuid shell
  (sh or csh) in the /tmp directory, thus creating a "back door" whereby
  any user can gain privileged system access.

o Monitor system logs - System access logs should be periodically
  scanned (e.g., via UNIX "last" command) for suspicious or unlikely
  system activity.

o Terminal servers - Terminal servers with unrestricted network access
  (that is, terminal servers which allow users to connect to and from
  any system on the Internet) are frequently used to camouflage network
  connections, making it difficult to track unauthorized activity.
  Most popular terminal servers can be configured to restrict network
  access to and from local hosts.

o Passwords - Guest accounts and accounts with trivial passwords
  (e.g., username=password, password=none) are common targets.  System
  administrators should make sure that all accounts are password
  protected and encourage users to use acceptable passwords as well as
  to change their passwords periodically, as a general practice.  For
  more information on passwords, see Federal Information Processing
  Standard Publication (FIPS PUB) 112, available from the National
  Technical Information Service, U.S. Department of Commerce,
  Springfield, VA 22161.

o Anonymous file transfer - Unrestricted file transfer access to a
  system can be exploited to obtain sensitive files such as the UNIX
  /etc/passwd file.  If used, TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol -
  which requires no username/password authentication) should always be
  configured to run as a non-privileged user and "chroot" to a file
  structure where the remote user cannot transfer the system /etc/passwd
  file.  Anonymous FTP, too, should not allow the remote user to access
  this file, or any other critical system file.  Configuring these
  facilities to "chroot" limits file access to a localized directory
  structure.

o Apply fixes - Many of the old "holes" in UNIX have been closed.
  Check with your vendor and install all of the latest fixes.

If system administrators do discover any unauthorized system activity,
they are urged to contact the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT).

Subj:	[2197] Home Security Systems

I am thinking about making some security-related improvements to my
home.  After putting deadbolts and strike reinforcements on the front
and back doors, I'm wondering what to do about the windows.  This is a
1955 ranch house with awning and casement type windows.  They are all
"manual", that is they don't have geared "operators", you just turn the
latch and push to open them.  Similarly, a burglar just breaks the
glass, turns the latch and pulls.  We close all the windows when we go
to work, but I think we may be going to get an alarm system, too.

What's a good book on do-it-yourself home security systems?

What are the trade-offs of do-it-yourself vs. a professional security
company? 

How do I protect my home without overtly annoying the neighbors, police,
etc. with false alarms.

Radio Shack sells "glass breakage detectors".  These are ~1" diameter
"pucks" that stick to the glass and are wired to an alarm.  

* What do these sense?  

* If they are in the corner of a picture window, and the
  other side of the window is broken but the glass under the puck remains
  intact will they trigger?  
* If they are impact-sensitive, will a truck or plane rumbling by set 
  them off?

How about area detectors, infra-red or sonic?  We have no pets to set
them off but:

* Can IR detectors see movement through windows?  Wouldn't want the
paper boy setting them off by mistake.

* How about changes in ambient IR levels caused by the sun coming in
through a window or the furnace going on or off?

* Are the sonic types sensitive to noises outside the house?

* Will, say, thunder shake the house enough to trigger a motion detector?

I see both wired and wireless alarm systems for sale.  Since I have good
attic and basement access, I am tending toward the wired sort.  The
wireless types seem to need occasional battery replacement.  Aside from
this are there reliability concerns wrt. either style?

Subj:	[2729] Ving Cards 

There used to be only one kind of Ving card lock.  Now there are two kinds,
as I discovered to my horror a while back while at a convention.  The first
and possibly "classic" version is all-mechanical, while the second is optical
with an electronic controller.  I did a longish article on the mechanical
one back when I got to take it apart, which I will send to anyone who asks,
and since the time of that writing discovered a few more things about it.
I believe this article was sent to this very list years ago...

My examination of the optical type occurred much more recently, and there are
still several things I don't know about it -- in particular how master-keying
is handled in software, since the pin-tumbler cylinder in this type appears
primarily to be for programming.  This lock uses the same technology as the
Yaletronics and its ilk; the matrix of holes is simply read by a bunch of
infrared LED/sensor pairs connected to the inputs of a small processor.  You
feed it the right number, it pulls the solenoid.  There is no mechanical
connection from the pin cylinder to the spring-latch mechanism, so I'm
clueless as to what people do if the batteries die on them.  Even with plenty
of advance battery-low warning, you'd think there would be a mechanical
bypass available...

You can quickly tell which type you have by the noises it makes.  The
mechanical version produces all kinds of racket as the card slides over the
ball-bearings; the optical presents no mechanical impediment to the card
save the little spring-loaded protective bar at the opening.  The mechanicals
have a "combination card" loaded into them through the hinged black cover
on the inside of the door, which is sometimes difficult to install and remove
due to the way the pins sit inside the matrix.

The pin-tumbler cylinders are made in-house by Ving, and sport a rather unique
feature.  About 30 degrees clockwise from the normal drivers there is a set
of "extra" drivers which are retained up in the cylinder housing.  All they
appear to be for is to store extra mastering splits you aren't using in the
regular lock.  Thus to change between several known keys, one would turn key
A over to this position, remove it and insert key B, and return it to the
locked position.  The difference between keys A and B causes splits to be
left at or picked up from the spare driver area.  They also have the magic-
rear-pin-ring dealbolt hack commonly found in hotel systems.

The last address I had for the makers of these things, if you want the
corporate party line, is

	Elkem Ving
	6200 Denton Dr
	Dallas TX
	800 527 5121

If someone tries the above and it's horribly wrong, please let me know, since
all of this was several years ago.

One other thing to check is that if you're locking to a sign post, there's a

away with the bike, lock and all.

Whatever you're locking to, make sure it's firmly mounted in the ground.

Subj:	[1078] need advice on secure PS/2

I'm looking for some advice on setting up a PS/2 Model 70 for doing
government classified work.  The primary requirement is that the
magnetic media be removable.  I'd like to go with a Passport made by
Plus, but its housing doesn't fit in the Model 70, which forces us to
use an external chassis.  Another problem is the fixed disk in the
Model 70 cannot be active (turned on) while working on classified
material.  Before we got our PS/2's, we used ATs which we modified by
installing a toggle switch on the back panel.  This switch allowed us
to turn off the power to the hard drive and boot off a Bernoulli.  We
would like something similar to this setup for the PS/2 70.  If anyone
has already solved these and related problems, I'd appreciate any
advice you can give.

BTW,  I understand IBM won't give out their schematic of their PS/2's,
so that we can't readily locate any of the power leads into the hard
drive.

>The DEC encryption approach was described to me to have 2 significant defects:
>1. You have to have a VAX to use it.

While it is true that the security management software (VAX KDC) will only run
on a VAX system, only *one* VAX system is required on a  network.  Furthermore,
VAX KDC software will run on any VAX, including small ones like the MicroVAX
3100.  

Digital's Ethernet Enhanced-Security System product set actually comprises two
separate products.  In addition to the VAX KDC software, there is the DESNC
secure network controller.

The DESNC controllers are freestanding devices that provide a secure network
interface for client nodes.  Client nodes may be any device that complies with
Ethernet or IEEE 802.3 standards.  The network security manager uses one or
more VAX KDC systems to manage the DESNC controllers and their associated
client nodes on a network.

It is true that DESNC encryption is done at the data-link layer, and as such,
encrypted packets can only be forwarded through routers after first decrypting
them.  Of course, this means that DESNC controllers will support
vendor-independent, multiprotocol environments.  Network-layer encryption
schemes, which allow packets to be forwarded through routers without
decryption, are generally restricted to a single network-layer protocol and
typically do not support other protocols that run directly on the data-link
layer protocol.

Our software encodes to the key after it has been loaded on the

There is a cracker on the loose in the internet.  This is the information
I have so far.  Traces of the cracker were found at the Institute for 
Advanced Studies in Princeton.  He also left traces at one of the Super
computer centers.  Both CERT and the FBI have been called.

The technique that is being used is as follows:

1) He has a modified telnet that tries a list passwords on accounts.  Username
   forwards and backwards, username + pw, etc.

2) He seems to have a program call "ret", that is breaking into root.

3) He seems to be getting a list of victim machines via people's
   .rhosts files.

4) He copies password files to the machines that he is currently
   working from.

5) He is good about cleaning up after himself.  He zeros out log files
   and other traces of himself.

6) The breakins are occurring bwtween 10pm Sunday night and 8am Monday
   morning. 

7) He seems to bring along a text file of security holes to the
   machines he breaks into.

8) Backtracing the network connections seem to point to the Boston
   area as a base of operations.

The sys admin at IAS found a directory with the name "..  " (dot dot

directory.

I don't think its just a matter of third party software being poor

to have a very poor record (security-wise) when it comes to their
own "add on" s/w let alone third party. I see time after time
new features introducing old bugs.
   On another subject (slightly related) what do readers think

it just a matter of education or trying to make it difficult
for s/w to make mistakes?

In the IBM world, a promise to run 15% faster than the competition
usually makes the sale to the DP manager.  That manager is rarely
concerned that the package happens to run faster because it runs the
users in privleged mode, and the saleman is unlikely to volunteer that
information.  His competitor might, but he probably has his own hooks
for some other function that he would prefer you not notice.

It is getting better.  While still a rare occurance, DP managers are
learning to ask what special facilities or privleged functions that
packages require, and then require that the package support the
underlying security facilities.  In the MVS world, that often means
some sort of statement of integrity, and interface to RACF or ACF2.
The driving force is often the EDP Auditor.  While they may not
understand computers (it is not their job,) they do exchange
information between themselves as to what packages are the biggest
abusers, and they do know the right questions to ask.  After all, their
interest is in understanding the risk of losing their companies assets,
and programs that allow access to those assets without authorization
are dangerous.

Subj:	[1499] REINIALISING PS/2 PASSWORDS

HOW CAN A PS/2 PASSWORD BE REINITIALISED ?

You use the REFERENCE DISK to set a PS/2 PASSWORD for the first time.

You use OLDPW/NEWPW to change the current PASSWORD.

But how do you re-invoke the password facility for the following situation:

    1    The password had been set.
    2    The password was removed by entering a blank value as a new password.
         (OLDPW/ <Enter>)

You can no longer set the password via the REFERENCE DISK as it reports that
the password is already set.

You can not change the password from 'blank' to something else via the normal
'CHANGE PASSWORD' process as you are no longer required to enter a password
when the system is turned on.

The only way I know to over come this situation is to remove the PS/2's battery
for about 20 minutes, and then rerun the system automatic configuration, and
the REFERENCE DISK's SET PASSWORD facility.

The above method is a real pain. I'm hoping that there is another way.

Is there another way ?

P.S. - Is there a way to find out the current power-on password value.

Thanks in advance for any help.

If you find one, let me know, too.  

If you do-it-yourself, it is cheaper and more secure(only you know the
details of your system) but you might not think of everthing the pro's
might.  Personally, I don't let ANYBODY know the details of the systems
I install, and I would not trust ANY company that doesn't have a good rep.

>How do I protect my home without overtly annoying the neighbors, police,

Don't have false alarms--seriously, they ARE annoying, and unless the
only function an alarm system does is call YOUR phone, you will annoy
someone.  Some police dept. don't mind having auto-dialers call them,
some do...check with the local and/or state police.

>Radio Shack sells "glass breakage detectors".  These are ~1" diameter
>"pucks" that stick to the glass and are wired to an alarm.  
>* What do these sense?  

They are mercury switches (can be set to be normal open or closed) and change
state when tilted more than a certain (preset) degree.  If someone can break
(or cut) just part of a window, they won't sense it.  They are most sensitive
to rotational motion around the center axis, so I did one installation where
the window loop is always active, but the windows can be opened or closed
without triggering the sensor...and trucks won't set them off.  Do your
best to hide them so that a potential intruder won't notice them and take
precationary steps.

>How about area detectors, infra-red or sonic?  We have no pets to set
>them off but:

Some IR detectors are sensitive enough to measure through glass...most aren't.
Sunlight WILL set them off...seen that happen more than once.
Ultrasonic motion detectors shouldn't detect noise, per se, but if the
thuder knocks a book off a shelf (had that happen to me once) it will.

>I see both wired and wireless alarm systems for sale.

I always use closed loop wired systems.  And redundant systems in special
areas.  Don't forget to check back-up batteries at least 1/month!
I think that any DIY can manage a good security system, if s/he thinks it
out ahead of time, and tries to think like an intruder.  Pay attention to
small details--e.g. don't install an auto-dialer then forget to protet your
phone wire entrance.  Radio shack has good stuff...probably enough for the
average home security needs.

Hope this helps.

These are mercury filled switches which you can set the "sensitivity"
by providing the inital tilt of the switch.  I use them in my car
for things like tee-tops.  (substatute velcro for the double stick tape)

I would suggest them only if tape is to obnoxious and you can't affored

Usually two slow in both cases,  I once walked across a room that was
protected via IR detectors, it took half an hour to cross 20 feet, but
I won the bet.   I suspect sonics are foolable in a similer fashion,
but *I* can't do it.

>* Are the sonic types sensitive to noises outside the house?

>* Will, say, thunder shake the house enough to trigger a motion detector?
I use both and we have lots and lots of thunder storms, the shaking of
the house has never set them off.. Books falling from the shelf across
the room will though.

IR detectors love heating element furnaces, and steam radiators,
generally anything that changes temperature quickly will set them
off.

Ultrasonic detectors love ceiling fans, and air vents (if they are
set too sensitive) 

>I see both wired and wireless alarm systems for sale.
Yeas, most wireless "broadcast" somehow, and like any RF signal it
is subject to distortion caused by outside interference.   Also
someone else my have an alarm system using the same codes and/or
frequencys that could cause yours to appear to false alarm. While 
wired alarms are subject to "rodent abuse." Like when the squirrel
that has made your attic its home desides to "borrow" a chunk of alarm
wire for its nest.

Wired is by far more reliable, and more work ;-)

Think closed loop, that *IS* the way to go, also the more loops the
better, that way you can still have a partial alarm system when 
a loop goes out..   Thats not good, but it's thousands of times better
than not having an alarm.

Look real carefully at off the shelf "base units" most of them are
low grade trash, generally in this area you get what you pay for.

Subj:	[3550] home security

I am in the process of installing a rather sophisticated security and access 
control system in my home.  Deadbolts and strike reinforcement are a good first
step, but the reality is that if somebody kicks hard enough, they will 
probably just take the frame out of the wall, unless you have a steel frame
around a steel door.

It's really not worthwhile to go to that trouble, though, because people will
just come through the windows unless you have bars or security screens on 
them.  If your goal is to keep somebody out physically, you will probably
have to turn your house into a fortress.  

	What's a good book on do-it-yourself home security systems?

	What are the trade-offs of do-it-yourself vs. a professional security
	company? 
	
Assuming you want central office monitoring, it is generally easier to get
hooked up with a professional system.  Most systems cost in the $1K-$2K price
range, and they do a very good job, so unless you have done this stuff a lot,
you are probably better off with something professional.

It's also a question of how much you value your time, how close what you want
is to what is available off-the-shelf, and wether or not you want to use a
radio-controlled system.

     How do I protect my home without overtly annoying the neighbors, police,
     etc. with false alarms.
	
Don't have false alarms.  They are typically caused by friends setting the 
system off, wind blowing doors open, auto-headlights setting off IR detectors,
and things like that.

	Radio Shack sells "glass breakage detectors".  These are ~1" diameter
	"pucks" that stick to the glass and are wired to an alarm.  
	* What do these sense?  
	
Vibration.  Other units can actually detect the sound of breaking glass.

	* If the other side of the window is broken but the glass under
	  the puck remains intact will they trigger?  

Yes.

	* If they are impact-sensitive, will a truck or plane rumbling by set 
	  them off?
	
Only if it breaks the glass.

	* Can IR detectors see movement through windows?  Wouldn't want the
	paper boy setting them off by mistake.
	
Not unless you have windows made out of NaCl.  Salt windows are typically
only found in laboratories, in circles of 1", for IR spectroscopy.

	* How about changes in ambient IR levels caused by the sun coming in
	through a window or the furnace going on or off?

Depends on the detector.  Some of the newer detectors will only trigger if
two or three beams are broken in succession, and these tend not to go off
with slow changes in temperature.
	
	* Are the sonic types sensitive to noises outside the house?
	
Ultrasonic detectors are generally not used anymore, since they are
very susceptable to background things that make ultrasonics (like pipes).

      * Will, say, thunder shake the house enough to trigger a motion detector?
	
Not of you have an IR detector, since they detect moving heat sources,
rather than just movement.

	I see both wired and wireless alarm systems for sale.
	
Wireless systems scare me, because of the potential for jamming.  With 
wireless systems, there is a version which is called supervised wireless, 
in which the central station constantly polls the remotes and asks them if
they are still working, and gives you an alarm when they fail.  The more
expensive ones will even send out messages when their batteries start
to go.

On the other hand, you can move a wireless system if you do.  And they 
are much cheaper to install.

> IR Detectors...

What do these detect?

They detect infrared energy in the area....a fresnel lens directs any and
all infrared onto a pyrodetector, and some electronics determine whether or not
it should be classified as an alarm or not....usually this is done via "Pulse
counting" which is a method whereby the detector counts the number of pulses
of energy that it has detected within a certain period of time (usually a{
2-3 second period...)....At the security system which I consult for, we set
this to TWO...makes for a good trade off between preventing false alarms due to
air vents moving plants, and the ability to detect a person...NO they will
not detect through the glass....although a good shot of sunlight right
into the lens of the detector will trigger it....simple solution -- keep the
drapes drawn...

Glass breakage sensors -- what do these detect?

There are two types:  Ones which "listen" for the frequencies of breaking
glass (audio discrimination) and the usual ones which sense low-level
vibrations such as would be caused by someone attempting to pry open the
windows...

The Radio Shack ones work via mercury type switches that when shaken enough
close a contact and trigger the alarm....they are not tooo reliable...The ones
at the security company I consult for use Terminus sensors, and run them into
a "processor" that makes heads or tails out of the signals comming from the
detectors on the windows....Otherwise thunder and rumbling trucks would set
them off all the time...

My personal favorite is a sensor known as the "ShatterBox" by Sentrol which
is an audio discriminator....of course if you have these armed at night and
then break a glass, you will set off the alarm...

My personal recommendation is to go with a system from a professional
company because there is a lot of grunt work involved in fishing all the
wires for a hardwired system (wireless systems are good, but another topic
altogether..) and in choosing the best protection for your home.  Also, if
anything goes wrong, they get to fix it, and you wont have to listen to the
wife (if you're married) saying "I told you it should have been done by a
company! *whine*".  Furthermore, they can and should be able to hook you up
to a central monitoring station for a nominal fee (we charge $21.50/month)
which will provide you with some neat features.  1) Assuming your phone lines
dont get cut, then when the alarm goes off, it will send a packet of data
via digital communicator to the central station over your phone line (it
seizes the line even if someone is on the phone or it is off the hook) and
tells them what zone got triggered....2) they call you back unless it's a
panic zone and ask for a password....3) if you provide the correct one they
dont send the police/fire dept/paramedics....4) if not, then they do...
5) if you arent there, they call a list of valid "keyholders" and tell them
the alarm went off, and call the cops/fire dept/ambulance....6) you can have
other sensors such as high/low temperature sensors, sump pump failure
(flood) sensors, etc...wireless panic buttons (even with a hard wired
system) and a variety of other goodies...

Also, if the company you choose is up on things, then they will use recessed
magnetic contacts that you will never see on the doors/windows...about the
only thing you will see is the smoke detectors if you have fire coverage,
and the shock sensors on the doors/windows (although these are practically
invisible...), the control keypad(s) in the designated area, and the alarm
CPU in the basement/closet of your home....

The CPU should have a battery backup, and recharge automatically.  Stay
away from the Radio Shack system, it uses lots of C or D cells and they are
a pain...also, no digital communication is available, and they only offer
their tape dialer which many police stations hate...also the panel is not
zoned, which makes servicing a complete bear...

More questions?  Drop me some E-mail...I'm experiencing hard drive problems
right now so I'm not on every day like I used to be, but I am here about
3 times a week...

Bye for now but not for long...
