The archive files herein are in VMS-sequential-mail-file format, with
messages separated by formfeeds and the "special" VMS headers, consisting
of From:, Subj:, and To: with tabs separating these headers from their
contents.  The original network headers have been inserted into the VMS
headers, including a [bracketed] message character count in the Subject:
line, so that VMS mail's "directory" output is more informative.  To
adapt these files for your own mail system, replace the formfeeds with
your own magic separator lines.  The messages were smashed with the
(vms-fix-mail-headers) function from <usr.hobbit>hacks.el [running under
Gnu emacs].  Have fun!
