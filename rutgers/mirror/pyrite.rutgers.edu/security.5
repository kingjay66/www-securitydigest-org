                CATE'S CURE FOR DATA CRIME

On or after the 12th of October, an undetermined number of computer
'viruses' are scheduled to start erasing the data of their unsuspecting
hosts. One virus in particular, known as 'DATACRIME II', is an
especially nasty specimen, as it not only spreads very rapidly, but also
formats the hard disk of any computer it infests, permanently destroying
all of the contents.

DATACRIME was first detected in the Netherlands, and the leading
computer publication of that country, PERSONAL COMPUTER MAGAZINE,
commissioned computer expert Rikki Cate to write an 'antidote' program
for its readers.  Cate, an American who lives in the Netherlands, is a
programmer specialized in this kind of work.

Cate's Cure was an overnight sensation.  Featured on radio, television
and in Holland's leading newspapers, thousands of copies were
distributed within the first few days and it has already inspired a
number of hastily composed imitations. Even the Dutch police have begun
distributing a version of their own.  Cate's Cure, however, claims
superiority to all of these.  It is much faster, it actually removes the
virus, it repairs damaged programs, it automatically searches all the
directories on the hard disk, and it provides permanent protection
against formating of the hard disk or new infections by the virus.  None
of the other programs released have any of these features.  This is
believed to have been confirmed in an independent test carried out by
the Dutch Railways.

In view of the huge demand and the clear anxiety indicated by that, Cate
has decided, with the approval of PCM, to make the antidote more widely
available on disk.  Additional information can be
obtained from her directly by calling 31-20-981963 in Amsterdam.  Fax:
31-20-763706, telex 12969 neabs nl, Fido 2:280/2, electronic mail

     The radio shack motion sensors for windows are mercury
switchs.  They depend on the sensor being thorougly moved to
another postion to set the switch off.  In this sense it is
impossible to set them off with mild vibrations.  You have
to really destroy the glass where they are.  They can be
set to almost tripped.  This would make them more likely to trip,
but if they move the wrong way they wont go off.

     Its a circular tube with merc in it and a switch at one end.

Some things to think about concerning RF security systems.

What frequency range do they use? Do they generate RFI? Are they susceptible
to interference from other transmitters located nearby (such as 1kw in the
house? Can the remote units be tested automatically from the central unit?
Are the remote units battery powered? If so, is battery failure detected?
Can the receiver be rendered ineffective by a local transmitter on the same
frequency?

Subj:	[1025] Email addresses on business cards risky?

Several of my friends recently joined a medium-size Swedish
firm.  (Name withheld, but it is definitely *not* Ericsson.)
They all wanted to have their electronic (email) addresses on
their business cards, but the firm's security manager would not
allow this.  He claimed that the host names in the addresses
would, collectively, reveal sensitive information.  I am very
skeptical of this claim.  By collecting a reasonably large
sample of cards, one could probably estimate the number of file
servers at the firm, but I don't see how that could help a
cracker.  The firm does not do classified or military work, and
is not on the Internet (Nordunet).

Has anyone heard of similar policies at other firms?  Does
anyone see any real risks of email addresses on business cards?
As usual, please email to me; I'll summarize if response
warrants.

Subj:	[1575] site policies

Greetings:
As a new subscriber to this list, please redirect me if the following
question(s) are better answered elsewhere.

We have a TCP/IP based campus network, growing rapidly for about a year
and a half, that has primarily been used by academic types (faculty &
students).  There is growing pressure to allow administrative users access
to MVS mainframe (via IBM's 5798-FAL product offering, dialing to VM VTAM).
The physical implementation includes thick and thin ethernet cabling,
a Proteon router, some fiber cable, IBM type 1?? cabling, a bridge here
and there, and a 56kb link to the rest of the Internet.

My two part question, the results of which I will refer to my management
to help them decide some policy issues, is as follows:

   1)  Other than the well known ease with which thick Ethernet cables
       can be tapped and passing data extracted, are there other weak
       spots (security wise) that we should be aware of regarding the
       physical links,
 and
   2)  What are the policies (briefly) that other campuses have regarding
       allowing confidential administrative data to flow over Internet
       links.

Please answer directly to me to avoid wasting network bandwidth with what
is probabily a thoroughly hacked over issue.  If there is enough interest,
I will post a summary.  Also, if there are any archived documents or
discussions regarding this issue, please direct me to them.

Thank you all.

Subj:	[3622] Re: Home Security Systems

I used to work for a security company (residental and commerical) and one of my
co-workers here at the University used to install residental and commerical
systems (he still does installations on a part-time basis).  The following
answers are a combination of our knowledge:

>What's a good book on do-it-yourself home security systems?
Guy did not know of any good, current books available.

>What are the trade-offs of do-it-yourself vs. a professional security
>company?
The main advantage is that the professionals are knowledgeable and experienced
(providing they are not one of the many fly-by-night alarm company that are
popping everywhere).  The secondary advantage involves monitoring; alarm
signals are sent to a central station who can then call the police, fire dept.,
your work number, etc. when your alarm goes off.

>How do I protect my home without overtly annoying the neighbors, police,
>etc. with false alarms.
Most of the newer alarms allow you to set a time limit on sirens with 15 mins
being the usual time limit.  Some cities have ordinances on siren time
durations and I would suggest that you check for these.  (Some cities require
that alarm systems be registered.  You should check this also.)

>Radio Shack sells "glass breakage detectors".  These are ~1" diameter
>"pucks" that stick to the glass and are wired to an alarm.
>* What do these sense?
These sense high-pitched sounds such as glass breaking.  Alarm technicians test
them by rattling keys.

>* If they are in the corner of a picture window, and the
>  other side of the window is broken but the glass under the puck remains
>  intact will they trigger?
Yes, it should; but it is dependant on the range of the detector.

>* If they are impact-sensitive, will a truck or plane rumbling by set
>  them off?
Yes, if they are too sensitive.  Some can be adjusted, others not.

>How about area detectors, infra-red or sonic?  We have no pets to set
>them off but:
You may not have any pets to set them off, but I have seen them set off by rats
and roaches (yes, we have *BIG* roaches here).  Guy says they are good, but
stay away from cheap detectors or you will be plagued with false alarms.

>* Can IR detectors see movement through windows?  Wouldn't want the
>paper boy setting them off by mistake.
No, the detectors don't sense "movement".  They sense changes in heat.  If you
were to hold a large piece of cardboard in front of you and move it slowly in
front of an IR detector, you could pass it undetected.

>* How about changes in ambient IR levels caused by the sun coming in
>through a window or the furnace going on or off?
Yes, temperature changes will trigger the detectors.  Don't point them at
windows, fireplaces, air ducts, furnaces, etc.

>* Are the sonic types sensitive to noises outside the house?
They should be.

>* Will, say, thunder shake the house enough to trigger a motion detector?
It shouldn't.

>I see both wired and wireless alarm systems for sale.  Since I have good
>attic and basement access, I am tending toward the wired sort.  The
>wireless types seem to need occasional battery replacement.  Aside from
>this are there reliability concerns wrt. either style?
Guy advises staying away from wireless systems as they are not as reliable.
Although he is not as familiar with the newer wireless sytems available, he
said the older systems had no low battery indicator.  A low battery can cause
false alarms; and of course, a dead battery is useless.

If you have any further questions, please feel free to ask.

PS:  Guy said if you pay his expenses he'd gladly come up and give you a hand.

      Dongles are dead.  There are many ads for them in PC Tech Journal,
but no mainstream package uses them.  Market resistance to them is
severe.  The Software Publisher's Association dropped their scheme for
an industry-standard unit some several years ago.

      However, it's worth noting that the Nitendo Game System has a
hardware protection device that makes it extremely difficult to make
a third-party game cartridge.  Attempts to reverse-engineer this

NEC however... all phone line comm is essentially insecure BOA 
knows this but they still use the modems and my code for it!!grin!!
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
No modem which uses a simple dialin line for dialout is secure.  There
is no way for the modem to ensure that when it makes the phone line
offhook that the dial tone it hears is from the phone company rather
than from a spoofing intruder.

There are special phone lines (ie, "ground-start"), but they require
that the modem use circuitry which supports that ability.

The simplest way to handle the problem is to use one or several incoming
lines for callback requests, then use separate modems on separate phone
lines to place the outgoing calls.  Some phone companies also allow
phone lines which do not allow incoming calls, and these can be used
for the callback lines.

I think there may be security modems which do support exactly this,
but they are so expensive it may be simpler to roll your own ct/login.

Why do you want a dial-back modem?  Security?  Or simply to avoid 
long distance charges?

I suggest that you implement this with host software.  It's a lot 
cheaper.
-simson
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Two methods, 

1) A product called "Defender", a modem or rack or modems where each
person has an ID, and that ID relates to a telephone number.  After you
call in and give your phone number (fron the terminal), the Defender
calls you back.

There is another option that instead of typing your number in with a
terminal, you can put it in with a touch tone phone.  That option
eliminates hackers searching for a modem.

2) Another system involves an electronic card that puts out a 5 digit
password that changes every minute.  By having to put in your "PIN"
number and this 5 digit code, it ensures that the caller (from
wherever) 1) is you (because of the PIN) and is in possetion of the
electronic card (Because of the 5 digit password).

I forgot the name of the 2nd system.

The Defender is available in single modem prices. (I don't know 
how much).

Weaker, yes, you could say that: SunOS shipped to Canada doesn't
have crypt at all.  The version is called "3.5EXPORT" (I haven't
opened my 4.x boxes yet :-).  Haven't noticed any other differences,
but of course I don't work with the native version.

Must be that immense border we share with you-know-who, although

Subj:	[1228] Privacy vs on-line library

First, this may be more of a talk.politics item, but then there have been
previous discussions here about privacy vs Social Security number etc.

Earlier this year I remember reading articles about the government wanting
libraries to turn over records of who checked out what book, apparently so
they could find out if anybody has been reading subversive material.  Libraries
(via whatever library associations exist) told the government to piss off,
and they weren't going to hand over such records (or keep them) because it
violated freedom of privacy and freedom of information.  I applaud this.

Our University library recently joined a regional conglomerate to obtain
on-line library catalog access (CARL - Colorado Area Regional Library,
or something like that), which also includes things like an on-line
encyclopedia.  However, to use the encyclopedia, one must enter their
bar code from their library card.  I tend to object to this on the same
grounds as stated above, that they have no business keeping records of
who looks at which databases.  I can walk into the library and read the
bloody thing without presenting an ID, why should on-line use be made

Subj:	[1755] User forms for RACF changes

   We are just now getting into running RACF on our MVS system and one
of the problems I (as the de facto Security Administrator) am
encountering is that the folks making requests to me for access to
protected resources invariably do not provide sufficient information.
This necessitates my responding with 'what do you mean?' and the
possibility of the requester doing the same thing means *really*
dragging the process out.

   What I'd like to find are some references to books or papers on how
to design the paper (or electronic) forms used by people (usually
resource owners or their agents) to submit requests to the RACF
Security Administrator.  I'd also like to know how other RACF sites
using centralized administration deal with the entire process of
granting and restricting access to protected resources.  References to
papers or books on this topic would also be welcomed.

   I would think that this might not be of general interest to list
readers so if you could respond directly to me, those on the SECURITY
list who are not RACF users would probably appreciate it.  Anyone who
*is* interested in whatever I learn is welcome to contact me for
copies.

   Thank you in advance for any assistance.

Subj:	[2012] Unix security products, A survey

I am carrying out a survey of security products that are
available for Unix machines. The idea is to collect together a review of 
the available products. It will be a "snapshot" of the various ways in 
which security can be added to unix, together with a brief description
of the main features of each.

This review would then be posted onto the net, and hopefully updated
from time to time. 

I am focussing on the following areas:

  1. Single level security products for Unix machines. Products that
     give a C2 level of assurance or something like it. 

  2. Multilevel security for unix machines. Products that give
     higher levels of assurance (B1 and up).

  3. Products that support either of these levels of security over
     networks of machines.

I am *not* collecting information on encryption devices/smart cards etc.

In order to jolt your memory I am already aware of the following in 
each of these categories.

  1. BOKS

  2. The Addamax and Secureware kits for system V and BSD. (I would be 
     interested to know of any manufacturer that has announced machines
     running either of these two); AT&T's MLS Unix; Unix System 5.4.2 which
     is said to be going to include B1 security as part of the 
     standard product. 

  3. None (well its a much trickier problem).

Any information or pointers that anyone can send me would be very welcome.
Names of further people to talk to would also be useful. Thanks in advance.

I should also state for the record that I am not associated commercially
with any company that makes any products of this type. I am an interested third
party who would like to get an overview of the current situation.

FYI: it seems the NASA DECnet network SPAN is under attack from a
DECnet virus. DCA, in its typical overreaction, has hit the explosive
bolts on the ARPA-Milnet mailbridges, effecting TCP/IP traffic on the

FYI. The mailbridges are apparently still up and advertising routes, but are
refusing to forward any packets. What this means for us is that our default
route through Ames is useless and that automatic fall-over to SRI is not
possible (because BR8 is still generating default). As a temporary measure, I
have disabled EGP on BR8 so that we can follow the default through SRI (this
will allow us to get to ARPANET-connected sites, which are few but better
than nothing...)

Subj:	[2357] Ultrix 3.0 breakins

			     CERT Advisory
			    October 17, 1989
			DEC/Ultrix 3.0 Systems

Recently, the CERT/CC has been working with several Unix sites that have
experienced breakins.  Running tftpd, accounts with guessable passwords
or no passwords, and known security holes not being patched have been the
bulk of the problems.

The intruder, once in, gains root access and replaces key programs
with ones that create log files which contain accounts and passwords in
clear text.  The intruder then returns and collects the file.  By using
accounts which are trusted on other systems the intruder then installs
replacement programs which start logging.

There have been many postings about the problem from several other net
users.  In addition to looking for setuid root programs in users' home
directories, hidden directories '..  ' (dot dot space space), and a modified
telnet program, we have received two reports from Ultrix 3.0 sites that
the intruders are replacing the /usr/bin/login program.  The Ultrix security
hole being used in these attacks is only found in Ultrix 3.0.

Suggested steps:
	1) Check for a bogus /usr/bin/login.  The sum program reports:
		27379    67	for VAX/Ultrix 3.0

	2) Check for a bogus /usr/etc/telnetd.  The sum program reports:
		23552    47	for VAX/Ultrix 3.0

	3) Look for .savacct in either /usr/etc or in users' directories.
	   This may be the file that the new login program creates.  It
	   could have a different name on your system.

	4) Upgrade to Ultrix 3.1 ASAP.

	5) Monitor accounts for users having passwords that can be found in
	   the /usr/dict/words file or have simple passwords like a persons
	   name or their account name.

	6) Search through the file system for programs that are setuid root.

	7) Disable or modify the tftpd program so that anonymous access to
	   the file system is prevented.

If you find that a system that has been broken into,  changing the password
on the compromised account is not sufficient.  The intruders do remove copies
of the /etc/passwd file in order to break the remaining passwords.  It is best
to change all of the passwords at one time.  This will prevent the intruders
from using another account.

Please alert CERT if you do find a problem.

Thank you,

Subj:	[1090] security of FAXen

A funny thing happened to my office-mate Doug and I the other day.

His phone rang, and he answered it ... after a few seconds, the following
transpired:

	Doug:	"Hey, Jordan -- what calls you up and beeps at you?"
	Jordan:	"Huh?"
	Doug:	"C'mere ..."

I was too late.  It had already hung up.  30 seconds later, his phone rang
again.

	Doug:	"Here it is again!  C'mere!"
	Jordan:	(listening for a second) "Hey, it's a FAX machine calling
		you ... let's forward it to our machine ..."

So we got an unintentional FAX.

It was pretty interesting.  It was from an Advertising Firm with some
Very Large Clients.  It was the monthly sales report.  We're happy to
report that they are doing quite well for themselves!

Needless to say, they were trying to send a FAX to somewhere in
Virginia, Area Code 703, and they neglected to dial ``1'' first.  In
New York City, we have so many telephones that we have prefixes that
are XnX where ``n'' is 0 or 1, so they look like area codes if you
don't dial 1.

Is there any work being done in the area of security or authentication
for FAXen?

Subj:	[1109] IR sensors: can they be tripped w/ a lo pwr IR laser?

Glass usually absorbs a quantifiable amount of the IR energy passing through
it... could, then, a fair- to high-quality IR sensor be made to trip by
either focusing a 3'-4' spot of IR energy on an opposing wall or a finer
spot directly on the device itself? The IR source I've in mind would be from
a relatively low power IR laser (in the range of 10 - 100 mW).

This is a serious question. I've in mind risk assessment... in the case where
a company or institution might be victims of harassment (albeit of a very
technical nature).

Any ideas? If anyone could give me an idea of the (wavelength) sensitivity 
band of one or more detectors (if you _know_; please, no guesses or 
approximations based on the fact that the detector senses `infra-red'... I 
can do that, too :-), it would help.

Subj:	[3044] RE: Home Alarm Installations, R.S. Setups

I've installed a burglar alarms using all Radio Shack equipment; The whole deal
is fairly inexpensive ($120? for the main unit, $100 phone dialer, switches,
etc) and wiring is straightforward (well, as straightforward as wiring a system
can be :-).  However, if you have any pets, motion/heat/pressure mat sensors
are out of the picture. 

A note of caution... be careful not to pinch wires when running them and
stapling them to walls.. this can build resistance in the circuit and cause
false alarms (a closed system trips when the total circuit resistance exceeds a
certain level). 

The vibration sensing switches are prone to strong winds, airplanes, truck
horns triggering them; therefore, use on windows instead of foil tape (for
cosmetic reasons) would have to be more than one for a big pane to be effective
with all the switches having fairly low sensitivity.  Still, I encountered
something interesting with these switches wired in series: the alarm is being
triggered for no apparent reason, calm winds, everyone inside sitting around
the house.  When the resistance in the circuit was checked I found it to be
over 500 ohms more than what it should have been.. troubleshooting the circuit
I found the resistance in each switch to vary, one by over 100 ohms...  seconds
later the same switch read 7 ohms.?!  Hmm...

So far this problem hasn't been fixed *but* resistance in the circuit still
seems like something to look out for.. make sure not to staple through wires
inadvertently! 

RE: the mercury glass breakage switches - Usually for windows people
   have three options if they're using the closed circuits: either
   the mercury switch, vibration switch or foil tape.  In a previous
   posting it was said that the mercury switch is impractical and it
   should be hidden so a burglar doesn't see it.  I disagree.  Part
   of the effectiveness of the system is its visibility (it even comes
   with window stickers).  The foil tape most often used is ineffective
   on big windows (e.g. glass doors) if put around the perimeter.  While
   the tape *is* sensitive to breakage, if the middle is cut carefully,
   entrance can be obtained without the alarm being triggered.  The
   "glass breakage sensor" follows the same theory that the glass will
   be broken enough to cause a shift triggering the alarm.  5 of one, etc.
   It's more a matter of cosmetics at that point.

   Also, as silly as it might seem to put a vibration sensor on a wall or
   room, there *have* been cases where burglars have broken in that way..
   if you're running a wire already it might be worth an extra few dollars
   to drop a vibration sensor here and there on some wall areas..

Overall, the Radio Shack support staff was VERY helpful and cooperative when
exchanging parts, etc.  Prices are reasonable and there are enough accessories to
build virtually any setup you would want... 

Many loops make debugging/altering the system much easier (as someone already
pointed out [good suggestion!])... 

Hope this info. is helpful to someone..

Nope.....not the Central Monitoring Station, but rather the alarm CPU in your
basement/utility closet....every 10-15 seconds the sensor puts out an "I'm
here " signal to the CPU, and the CPU remembers it.....if it doesn't get a blip
then it waits another 15 seconds or so and sees if it gets one again...if it
doesnt, then it sends a signal to the Central Monitoring Station saying
"Supervisory on Zone ##" where ## is the number of the zone that died...
of course if someone is sophisticated to jam your xmitters (319.5 MHZ for
those of you wondering...) then they could also just cut your phone line
and unless you have a cellular dialer, or high security connection then
you are out of luck....

Also, the newer wireless systems (such as the ITI SX-V) has sensors that have
the brains to send a "Hey CPU, my battery is dying" signal to the CPU so
that the CPU can call the central monitoring station, and then they will
call either you and your dealer, just your dealer, or just you....then your
dealer can come out and replace the batteries for you -- or if you can find
the proper equivilent then you can do it yourself...

	Radio Shark is pretty expensive considering the quality and options
they sell. Try some place like Aritech. (1-800-432-3232 for a catalog and
make up a security company name for your mailing address) They carry much
more stuff, and have the advantage of *KNOWING* their merchandise. (Try going
to your local Radio Shark and asking them about how the controller *works*)
They have good technical support, too.

	As far as the other poster's remark that a do it yourselfer might
miss something the pros might not: That's true, but a do it yourselfer can
do a lot of things the pros won't think of, or recommend. Examples are:
wireless units with magnets between the VCR and the TV (move them and the
alarm goes off - I don't sit with my alarm on when I watch movies), wireless
units in the jewelry box (a fun one), wireless (or wired, at that) units
between stereo components and stereo cabinet, etc. When I worked for a 
burgular alarm company, we never did anything like that because we could
not rely on our customers not setting the darn things off constantly.

	Things that do it yourselfers *DO* forget: 
	Horns/sirens outside, but not wired into the loop so that they can
	be disabled safely.

	Bells outside in cabinets where they can be reached (even if the
	bell cabinet is alarmed,a bell can be totally silenced with a can
	of polyurethane spray insulation)

	Making perimeter alarm units hidden. If they can't see them, they
	can't be scared off by them. We used to use a mix of perimeter
	alarms and then at least 1/3 as many interior alarms - stuff like
	between the doors to the master bedroom, computer room, etc.

Doesn't everything nowdays? :-U Seriously though, they don't generate anything

Not really, the signals are coded with a "House Code" that each transmitter
has to be individually programmed to use, and there are about 10,000
possibilities for these....'course anything is possible...

> Are the remote units battery powered?  If so, is battery failure detected?

YES! Why else would you want to install a wireless system, if you had to
run wires to the individual sensors for power? Just add two more wires, and
presto! you have a hardwired alarm...

In reality, the sensors send a special signal to the CPU when their battery
starts to die (3-5 years on the lithium ones in there now...), and the CPU
calls the Central Station and tells them....then the Central station contacts
your dealer....Your CPU also informs you that the battery is dying when
you attempt to arm the alarm (you get a TROUBLE signal on Zone ##)....

Also, the zones are all supervised, and the sensors send a signal to the cpu
every 60 seconds or so saying "YO! I'm Here!"....if not, then a SUPERVISORY
signal shows up...

> Can a receiver be rendered inneffective by a transmitter on the same
> frequency?

Yes, but since all the xmitters are supervised, and since the transmissions
are coded, all the bogus transmitter would do would be to jam the signal, and
if the central station gets 47 Supervisory signals in 5 minutes from the
same alarm panel, then they will call the police...

Oh yeah, all the above is referencing ITI products....

Subj:	[1480] Re: Privacy vs on-line library

Ah, at last some interesting discussion...

I am currently doing my master thesis, and part of the work is
definition and classification of security and security policies. I
have some problems with 'privacy'

In a book discussing the Norwegian privacy act [Dj\o nne 1987:
"Personregisterloven, med kommentarer"], privacy is defined as: 'A
person has personal interest in 1) discretion, 2) information
correctness, 3) knowing what information processing that may cause
consequences for him/her, and 4) sanctity of private life. And
moreover: 5) the interface to the authorities should keep "a human
face", 6) the vulnerability of databases should be minimized, and 7)
people should be protected from unreasonable use of power by the
authorities.' (Abstracted and translated by me.)

The central point in the act itself is to 1) enable individuals to
determine data collected on him or her, to get incorrect information
corrected and to get irrelevant information deleted, and 2) regulate
who is allowed to collect, process and store what information in
electronic computers. (There are more, but this is what I myself find
'central'.)

If security is defined as "a system's ability to maintain
confidiality, integrety and availability of information", where does
privacy fit?

Another question: Do you agree with the above 'definition' of privacy?
Does your contry's privacy act (if you have one) agree?

Jim,
	Question, does your library card identify you as Jim Kirkpatrick, or
does it just identify you as being from your university?

> that they have no business keeping records of  who looks at which databases.

What makes you think that this is required because they are keeping records of
who looks at what?

> I can walk into the library and read the

	You can walk into the library and read the thing, because the library
is supported by the university and assumes that nobody NOT from the university
will use it (or at least the use will be minimal).

	I can think of a very good reason that some form of ID is required. I
assume (I may be wrong on this part) that your card identifies what library it
is for.  I also assume that your library pays a fee for access to this network
(or at least for access to the encyclopedias).  The network needs to prevent
unauthorized access by people from non-member libraries. To do this it requires
you to enter your library card bar code as a means to verify that you are
indeed from a member library and are therefore authorized to use that system.

	Another reason (variation on the above) is that the member libraries
are billed based on the usage by their people. This requires that the network
know what library you are from when using this system.

	I agree with you that the keeping of a database of who looks at what is
wrong, but I disagree with your assumption that this is the reason that the 
bar code is required.

Responding to my recent query on library systems, Michael Chinni asks --
   >Question, does your library card identify you as Jim Kirkpatrick, or
   >does it just identify you as being from your university?

To clarify, the library card is actually just a bar-code sticker slapped
on the back of my normal University ID card.  Thus the card itself
identifies ME, has my picture, and social security number (printed AND
embossed!).

Also, to clarify, to access either the on-line encyclopedia or a database
of newspaper/magazine articles, I must enter my bar code number AND my
last name (I found it only looks at the first 10 characters, but those
10 must be correct).  So it has a table of bar codes and who they were
assigned to (that's reasonable, when you check out a book and don't
return it they need to know who to send the goons after :-).

  >> they have no business keeping records of
  >> who looks at which databases.  
  >What makes you think that this is required because they are keeping
  >records of who looks at what?

I admit the above was an overstatement.  I don't know that they are keeping
records of who looks at what, or if they are simply authenticating and
counting usage.  But I don't know they AREN'T keeping track, either.

  > assumes that nobody NOT from the university
  >will use it (or at least the use will be minimal).

I would suggest that unauthorized use of the online encyclopedia is likely
to be minimal as well.

>	I agree with you that the keeping of a database of who looks at what is
>wrong, but I disagree with your assumption that this is the reason that the 
>bar code is required.

It was a wrong assumption from the view that I don't KNOW they are keeping
track, but I don't KNOW that they AREN'T.  Any such system CAN be abused
almost trivially and without notice to the users.  One example is the repeated
use over the past hundred years or so of gun registration lists to confiscate
guns, despite a government's insistence such lists would never be used that
way (WWII Germany was particularly brutal in this regard).  I do not mention
this to compare guns with books, but just to point out that governments will
and do abuse their power to gain access to information they want.  I would
rather it be impossible for the information to exist, than to be assured (by
people who don't even understand the system) that such records aren't being
kept.

"The price of freedom is eternal vigilance" or something like that.

It sounds like an accounting measure to me.  Is your department charged for
database usage?

What I would push for is the same privacy which the census provides --
make sure no record is released (or, better, kept) of individual data,
releasing info only when no specifics about individuals can be deduced from it.
You might do that here by having a group ID card to be scanned -- one giving
just the department ID (or whatever the accounting entity is).

If you can trust the local programmers, you could depend on them to accumulate
no data about *what* you're accessing -- only about how long you use the
service.

If you can't trust the programmers you need a pay-phone type of facility.
That could be with a coin box or a time meter (like the little boxes you
used to walk around with for Xerox machines -- the ones with your own
odometer style copy counter).

   IMHO the issue here is the management of a finite, money consuming
resource in very much the same manner as your userid is on your system.

   The arguement can then be made that anyone can walk off the street
into your universities library and read the book manually. This is a 
valid point, but if a large group of non-students began to use the library
resources to the point that it impeded legitimate users (students) the
University would then have to do one of two things; increase their
expenditures to support the activities of people unrelated to them, or
cut them off.

   Your membership in your Universities library system is your ride ticket,
though it may just as easily be used to monitor the materials you read.
Life's a bitch, but it is unrealitic to expect that you can use shared
computing reasources without the possiblity of footprints. Ultimatley,
your previous options are and will remain open, 1) go there physically
have a seat and read or 2) buy a copy of the book.

Cc: John Rudan <JWR@CornellA>, Tom Boggess <TDB@CornellA>

As the primary technical support person for a library system, I would like
to point out that there are not necessarily any privacy issues involved here.
The question is whether the system is storing the ID's when they are entered,
and if so, what happens to them. A good example - any library staff member
can certainly (and appropriately!) find out who has what books checked out,
and what books any given individual has checked out. A few programmers can
even construct the borrowing history of a given individual (a moment's thought
about how a library works will tell you this). The fact that something CAN
be done does not imply that it is being done.

A better question is whether your ID number can be, and is, correlated to
your Social Security number. There's probably no good reason why it should
be, although often systems are designed by people who are completely
insensitive to privacy issues.

Finally, however, I find your attitude that somebody owes you free online
use of whatever services are offered rather amusing. If you don't want to
identify yourself, walk down to the library and use the books. Presumably
there are billing issues involved, where somebody is subsidising your online
use of an encyclopedia, and asking you to identify yourself for that reason.
I'm sure that if you went to the source and offered to establish a fund to
pay for completely open use, they'd be happy to set it up.

Remember that the provider of the service (the encyclopedia) has something
to say about who uses it. I would guess that CARL has a site license that
says they may make it available to their own community, but not the world at
large. It may be that your ID is validated against a table and no information
stored about your access, except possibly a counter indicating the total
number of accesses for the encyclopedia. An encyclopedia company that did
NOT have such a licensing strategy would quickly go broke, because of selling
only one copy of each edition which somebody would put online.

It was the FBI hoping to find out if Soviet/East Block embassy employees
were requesting tech/engineering materials at Columbia University. I wrote
to my congressman about it and got a letter back from the FBI in DC. 

I helped install an on-line catalog/Library Information System called PALS
at a small college here in Minnesota. Our initial setup didn't require password
or barcode numbers to access the system although the feature was available.

The reason to use the access code is MONEY! It cost the college about 2.5 cents
per transaction. At the time, we weren't implementing circulation on the
system,so students and faculty didn't have barcodes. Since the town was allowed
to use the library also, we didn't want to restrict their access right off the 
bat.

Keeping tract of who requests what is possible, if you want to spend the time
and money. Most libraries don't have either.

[An interesting side note, Len Deighton's latest book "Spy Hook" tells of an
database that logs attempts to retrieve restricted data.]

Subj:	[2079] Re: Privacy vs on-line library

First, Jim, I'm writing as a person who values and respects the
privacy of user records.  When I became a librarian I signed off on
the idea that people's records are not to be shared, and so on.  What
I am writing is not necessarily the official policy of CARL.  Still,
I'll address your issues:

a. In the case of the encyclopedia and other databases that are made
available on Online Catalogs, we are required by the database
supplier's contract to limit the use of certain databases to the
primary user population of our members.  What that means is that, for
instance, a U Wyoming student/faculty/staff person has full access to
that database (the encyclopedia, for instance), but a citizen of the
state of Wyoming (not known to the University..) does not have access.
If we don't restrict access to only the primary user population, then the
database provider can accuse us of breach of contract, and ultimately
has the right to yank the database from us.

Sadly, the 'limit access on your online system' strategy is being em-
braced more and more by the database suppliers (see the discussion on
the Library PACS-L Bitnet mailing List).  I don't see it getting
better, either, because the databse suppliers are scared that too much
online use is going to transalate into fewer print subscriptions,
which is what really pays their bills.

By the way, the CARL privacy issue is not what you think.  When you
come into a password-controlled database, we set a switch to "1"; when
you exit, we turn it back to "0". (You can't use a password controlled
database on the same password at the same time).  CARL doesn't log who
used what database at what time - sure, we could, but no, we're not
doing so.  

Final note, Jim - if you're on one of the hardwired terminals at
Wyoming, you're not asked for a password at all.  (The hardwired
terminals are all located in the various libraries there).  Only the
remote dialups need passwords.

I can't see this at all.  For one, "file server" is kind of a loose thing.  The

numbers of machines at your site; I can't see how that could possibly be of any
use.

I introduced the idea of email addresses on  business cards at a previous
employer, but then, they were more backwards than I want to think about.  The
form here at Convex that you fill out to get cards has a blank on it for your
address.  If a company has a consistent namespace and nicely done mailers,
everyone's card should say foo@company.com anyway, which wouldn't tell anyone
more than the fact that you had one machine, which they could have figured out
anyway.

Even so, nothing's stopping them from scribbling their addresses on the back of
the card anyway.

Secure Distributed Databases
for Epidemiological Control

Abstract

The project's objective is to develop a personal computer-based system for 
control of infectious agents. The overall goal is a better understanding of 
affects of enhanced social facilitation and health education on disease 
transmission. A new theory for real-time epidemiological control, based on 
contact tracing, is used to design a cryptographicly secure distributed-
database system providing situationally specific risk assessments that are 
based upon personal histories.

Personal computer systems negotiate exchanges of information that permit 
preselection of conversation partners. The techniques used yield unprecedented 
protection for user's identities and data. The systems permit self-
administration of questionnaires and distribution of health information, as 
well as communication with selected conversation partners. 

Information on changing health status and risk related behaviors are routinely 
gathered during system operation. In addition to giving users situationally 
specific risk assessments, these data permit new types of epidemiological 
analysis.

A pilot project devoted to design and development of a prototype system is 
specified in detail. The plan includes discussions with potential 
organizational participants in the proposed experiment and other interested 
parties.

an old Yale that's essentially impossible.  The book describes
anti-manipulation features as: tightened tolerances, added mechanical

It's a dial-back security device called a Traq-net (I believe), made by
Lee-Mah Data Security.

The tone is a prompt to enter a touch tone id-code. With the id-code,
the device calls back the telephone # associated with the id-code, which 
then auto-answers or manually answers the line, establishing a modem
connection.

I believe there is also a provision for having it dial you at other
pre-determined numbers when you are travelling. The Traq-net also logs
all calls, both invalid and valid.

It was a neat device, but there was significant user resistance to using
it, so it eventually fell into dis-use. Combined with a strong security
program it would probably work well in some environments.

As far as I know, and I'm not sure if this is a NY state law or a federal

the student/alumnus specifies so.  If these people have or have had a

avenue.

There's always the notion of posting something in the personals of a well-read

last names are involved.  The key here is, of course, where do you think they

If anyone in the group has even a remote connection with the military, try
using the locators (usually free) in the branch publications:  Army Times,
Air Force Times, Navy Times...  Even if they've served in a unit five years ago
and aren't in anymore, there's the chance that someone who served with them
might still be and be able to relay you information on their whereabouts.

One thing the enlightened cyclists are doing in Manhattan is two always
lock the bike up with two different kinds of locks.  The average bike thief
is only prepared to break one kind of locking system.  The usual
combination is a U-lock and a flexible cable with padlock.  That means the
thief would have to carry two different sets of tools to get the bike.

Most streetwise bikers also take some old chain links and rivet a little
loop of chain between the bicycle seat and the frame, to discourage parts
theives from taking the seat.

Bike theft is disgusting in this city: even your 3-speed covered with rust
isn't safe.  The new unit of commerce is the crack vial: as long as your
bike is worth at least one vial to someone, it is a potential theft
target.

On a related note -

Did you know that the 976- , and 1-900 people also keep track of who
calls, and sells your phone numbers to advertisers in the same manner that
credit card companies sell your address?

I'm not sure if this is also true for 1-800 calls, since they are AT&T or
another carrier company, but apparently there are no rules against selling

I used to do this all the time with "thermocons" which were IR

to trip the drop bolt when people were walking OUT of the secured

made the door unlatch.  Even if there is no way to do it with
a laser (sometimes you could not get line of sight to the sensor)
then you can get a can of lighter fluid, squirt it all under the

It depends on the model, but in general S&G makes pretty good combination
locks.  "Anti-manipulation" usually indicates just what it says, that the
lock design includes features especially aimed at making manipulation
(the art of opening a combination lock without knowing the combination a
priori) difficult.  One such feature would be additional (shallow) fake
notches around the periperhy of the wheels.  The best feature is one that
prevents using the actuator handle to apply drag to the wheel pack.

Subj:	[949] Alarm Tripping, Home Alarm Installation

I have a home wired with all Radio Shack parts; when the main unit is tested 
alone without ANY loops, all works fine (keypad, panic buttons, etc).  When I 
add any loops to it, it periodically is tripping for "no apparent reason."

The loop is a straight loop consisting of only Vibration Sensors... due to the 
false tripping the adjusting screw has made the system useless for now as only
a LARGE bang would trigger them.. but still, on a calm day, no winds, everyone 
still, the alarm (armed) is being set.

All I could figure is something building up resistance in the circuit.. all 
wires are stapled to wooden structural supports or studs, the system is
grounded and there is a battery backup in place.

ANY ideas as to what could be causing the problem???  At times it has been
flawless for periods of 2 months and then it starts happening daily!! :(

> DEC also won't let us put 'internal' hostnames on our business cards. 

The obvious solution is to have DEC-wide unique aliases recognized by
the mail server on dec.com.  Then put unique.id@dec.com on your cards.
If you come across a CMU business card check it out -- excelent example.

Not putting internal names on published documents is a good idea for
two reasons.  First it prevents trouble when the machine you named
goes away, permanently or temporarily.  Secondarily it makes it harder
for the bad guys to use "traffic analysis" and similar techniques to
deduce things about what DEC might be up to.

Personally I think if they care enough to do that there are other ways
to figure it out, but since the technical considerations align with
the political in this case it seems logical to do it right.

In the absence of a usable common address the "security" argument
has to be fought.  It is weak but not invalid, so it becomes a
question of priorities.

> I found the resistance in each switch to vary, one by over 100 ohms...  secon
> later the same switch read 7 ohms.?!  Hmm...

I installed a RS system in my house and found this to be a major
problem. It appears that RS sells the lowest quality magnetic switches
possible. The only way I was able to solve the problem (short of
replacing all the switches) was to wire each loop to control a 12v
relay. The relay contacts were then wired to the alarm center in
place of the loop.  This had the effect of increasing the loop
current from about .5ma to 50ma.  The increased current and/or the
inductive "kick" from the relay coils seems to have solved the
problem.

Before adding the relays I was averaging one false alarm per week.
Obviously an unacceptable situation that prevented connecting the
noise makers.  After adding the relays I continued testing the system
for 3 months with zero false alarms before connecting the noise
maker. It has now been connected for about 2 years with zero false
alarms.

The moral of the story is that the RS stuff can be made to work
reliably. But probably not by your average consumer.

To a large extent, S&Gs are the best ( or one of the best).  We have 
them on a Mosler and and older Remington safe, both GSA certified
storage containers for classified materials, the Remington at Secret
and the Mosler higher than that.  The Mosler is a double safe, with
an S&G MP on the outside, and a special S&G on the inside (built to 
somebodies specifications).  Your local Mosler lock people will 
support the S&Gs with no problem, doing yearly maintenance, etc. and
getting you out of a jamb (pun intended) when you need it...

I am not sure what you mean by "anti-manipulation" feature;  ours are
MP locks, Manipulation Proof, but that really has to do with the 
internals on the lock, not an external locking pawl or anything 
like that. 

By the way, don't make the mistake that a lot of people do and fail
to get yearly maintenance done on the lock(s).  Sure, they most likely
won't need it, and you will be throwing around $100/year to the wind,
except for the day that the damned thing jams on you, and you discover
the extreme cost of having your safe/vault drilled...  Remember that 
these things are designed specifically to make it hard to do this.
The estimate to have one of our drilled by Mosler was many hundreds
of dollars, plus materials costs (14 diamond tipped bits, 2 drills
[they figure that they will burn out 2 doing this] and other assorted
things) plus the cost for them to weld in a plug of hardened steel
and then the possibility (if you are a cleared storage facility) that
the Government folks are not going to like the plug job and require
that you buy a new safe door and have it put on... Big Bucks...

  The libraries are both charged by information providers and funded by

keep track of usage information for funding purposes (and for
book-replacement estimates), and the need to **not** keep track of readership

Cc: security@rutgers.edu

   If security is defined as "a system's ability to maintain
   confidiality, integrety and availability of information", where does
   privacy fit?

I would say that "security" is an amoral term.  It refers to whether
the system is performing its job properly.

"Privacy," on the other hand, provides constraints on the system's
goals.

In particular, a system can be secure without being private.
Hypothetical example: a credit bureau may operate a secure system.
However, the bureau may choose to sell its data to a third party.  No
security breach has occurred, but a privacy breach has (in this
example, at least).

   Another question: Do you agree with the above 'definition' of privacy?
   Does your contry's privacy act (if you have one) agree?

(1) Yes.  (2) Who knows, at least in the U.S.? (:-).

This is not true for the Library I program for.  When a circulation
transaction is resolved, checked back in, the circ trans is archived but
any link to the user record is zeroed out.  This allows the archives to
be used for stat anal but protects the privacy of the user.  Most
Libraries are strong believers in information rights and do whatever
they can to protect the rights of their users.

Sargent & Greenleaf locks are very high in quality.  Their manipulation

The manipulation resistance of S&G 8400 and 8500 series locks is not
derived through the use of key-locking dials although locking dials
are available as an option.  The action of the locks is designed to
deter manipulation by preventing convenient contact between the lever

Subj:	[3769] How to track people down.

Finding people?  I have spent considerable time and effort doing this
sort of work.  The only solid rule for tracking people down is that there
are no solid rules.

In general, finding people depends upon knowing enough about the target
subject(i.e. the person you want to find) to gain direction for the search.
For instance, I was retained to search for a gentleman that had absconded
from the Seattle area with substantial debts left behind.  I knew very
little about the guy other than his name, the fact that he had a trust
fund administered from Los Angeles, and that he had been planning to wed
a woman from Seattle when he was last heard from several weeks before.

In this case, I managed to locate a marriage license in the King county
(Seattle) Courthouse which yielded the name and address of the woman he
had, by the time of this search, married.  Although the man had covered
most of his tracks pretty well, the woman he had married took no effort
to obscure her path.

Consequently, I had the woman's name and last known residence(in
Renton, Washington, a suburb of Seattle)when I left the courthouse.  Once
I had this, the remaining follow up was reasonably simple.  It turnt out
that her prior residence she had been living in was up for sale.  A visit
to the real estate agent acting as broker afforded a reasonably fast
face-to-face meeting with the fugative I sought.   He, it developed, was
handling all the business of his new wife.  The real estate agaent very
thoughtfully arranged the meeting, and also provided me with the seller's
new home address.

I tell this story as a means of illustrating an approach to finding people.
While in general it is helpful to review information resources like the
telephone book, Polk directory, etc., I believe that a general priciple
is the best advice.  Find out all you can about your target, then determine
what, if any, information resources this knowledge of your target implies.
If you are uncertain what information your basic knowledge of your target
does imply, take what you know to an expert(like the records clerk in the
city/county building where the target I mention above had filed his marriage
license) and ask the expert what intelligence is necessarily implicit in
the information you have as a foundation.  Once this is accomplished, the
remaining task is to exploit this information.

As for expert assistance in developing the leads that you start with,
there are as many sources for this intelligence as there are catagories
worth exploiting.  I know very little about tennis, for instance,
but I know enough that if I found that a suspect I sought was a heavy tennis
player, I could certainly locate a tennis expert to tell me what
organizations associated with tennis might yield the suspect's location.
Failing that, if the suspect is a serious tennis player, and I have a good
idea what city he might be in, I might be able to develope leads by asking
questions at atheletic clubs in the area.

Although this approach seems like common sense, many people tend to forget
what creatures of habit we humans are, and they consequently fail to
exploit the obvious when searching for someone.  Nonetheless, I have found
this approach fairly useful.  Just find out all you can about your target,
then think! One must compile all available information on the target
subject, then follow it up and exploit whatever leads this information
developes.

I haven't had experience with these systems, but I don't like the

it's replaced.  With everything separate, if you lose your keys, you
can still eat, and if you lose your library card you can still get into

   The first thing that comes to my mind after reading about this "Smart Card"
is its potential for abuse. If it is lost or stolen, how easily can the 'old'
card's access be removed from the system? Also if it is lost or stolen, will a
'backup' of its information be kept in a separate facility - imagine the
concern if the student adds $500 to the card, only to have it lost or stolen
moments later on the way to class. Just some thoughts that came to mind...

Does anyone know about the security implication on Cellular Modems.
Since cellular transmissions are in the 800 frequency band, anyone with
a receiver which can tune in to these hight frequency bands could
listen in.   Therefore, I have 2 questions:

    1.  How is a Cellular modem different than regular modems? (What
        special features does this type of modem must have.)

    2.  How about security?  If anyone can basically "Tune" in, what
        implications will this lead to as far as the technological aspect
        of the hardware?

I'd appreciate any comments on this matter.

Greetings,
Thanks to all of you who responded to my question last month regarding
site policies about the use of Ethernet/Internet and possible integrity
problems.  Of the 21 responses I received, almost half (9) were requests
for the results.  This implied a lot of interest in the topic, so I was
mildly suprised that I didn't get more responses.  Anyway, here's what
I got (first the question again):
  . . .

   . . .
I would be very interested in the content of your replies. We have just
started Ethernet service on our academic 3081 using VM TCP/IP. There is
already a good deal of pressure to allow administrative access to our 3090
running MVS. I would greatly appreciate forwarded replies, and the final
conclusion you reach and why you made that decision. Thanks.
  . . .
********* has over 4000 (that's not a typo) VAXs, workstations, Suns, and a
few large IBMs hooked via TCP/IP. The hardware is NSC hyperchannel for a
backbone and their routers on local ethernets. We have lots of business data
and engineering data going internally and internationally. Because of legal
considerations, we have stated over and over that the network is not a
secure network, and had better be treated as such. That probably has been
forgotten along the way, but at least we're on record as trying to do the
right thing.  Hope this helps.
  . . .
well I think the biggest issue is not not allow any non-secure machine to be
directly attached to the backbone, since it then can be put in promiscious
mode and monitor the traffic.  There is no way to secure a PC or other
workstation type machine. If it is seperated from the backbone by at least a
router, then only information from that particular subnet will be potentially
visible to it.  folk kick about the extra cost, but i think it is essential.
  . . .
We are currently in the process of setting up as you describe. We were
also concerned about the lack of security of ethernet. As soon as it
arrives I hope to switch our 8232 from VM to MVS.  Since we were
assured that there is little difference in most of the TCP/IP code used
on the 2 operating systems we began develloping an encryption technique
for use over ethernet.
The authors of the BW series of ethernet software are part of our
networks & communications group, in fact they both read the TCP/IP lists.
The BW software now supports access via the 8232 and they expect to
have the encryption facility working shortly. This will consist of a new
version of the BW software together with updates to the mainframe
TCP/IP software.  Other changes include full color support as well as
handling the YTERM TPRINT command.  Kermit is used for file transfers.
  . . .
I would be interested in a posted summary of this information, and if you
find any archived documents, I'd be interested in those too.  I've only been
on TCPIP-L since May, but I have not seen anything on this subject there or
on another list.
  . . .
I too am interested in responses to these questions.  Some members on
our campus are also contemplating allowing access to "sensitive"
information via the campus TCP/IP network (using Telnet, FTP, etc.).

Some of our local experts feel that we have little to be concerned
about.  However, I read an article in the April issue of "Computer
Communication Review" titled "Security Problems in the TCP/IP
Protocol Suite" by S.M. Bellovin (AT&T Bell Laboratories) that got
me a bit concerned.  A follow up article in the July issue by
Stephen Kent (BBN Communications) "Comments on 'Security Problems in
the TCP/IP Protocol Suite'" pointed out inaccuracies, etc. in the
first article but still did not alleviate my apprehension.

In short, Mr. Kent's article seemed to say that the TCP/IP Protocol
Suite isn't secure unless end-to-end encryption is used at the
network layer.  My questions:  is the article correct?  Am I
interpreting the article correctly?  If so, are such security
mechanisms implemented on the Internet?  If not, can we implement
such a security mechanism on our local network even if the rest of
the Internet doesn't?
  . . .
Basically, TCP/IP is not secure, but that is more of a function
of the underlying transport mechanism than it is of TCP/IP.
TCP/IP typically runs in
a LAN or WAN type environment.  In this environment, generally
all messages are physically broadcast to everybody, even if they
are logically intended for one target.  (There are also messages
which are *supposed* to be broadcast, and *supposed* to be seen
by everybody, but that is a different issue).  There are numerous
exceptions to this "everybody sees everything" rule, of course.
Bridges and gateways serve to limit the scope of the "broadcast"
of messages intended for for one destination, but within the
"local" network, everybody sees everything.

The idea with "everybody sees everything"
is that your system looks at and throws away stuff that it
sees that is really for somebody else.  Obviously, it is not hard
to simply keep the stuff and not throw it away.  In a token ring
environment, it is generally the hardware itself that is making this
determination, so it is a little hard for the casual user to peek at
something he shouldn't.  In an Ethernet environment, it is generally
the software that is making the determination, so it is usually easy
for the casual user to peek at every packet that comes by.  UNIX
systems often have such peeking programs built in.

Suppose you have an Ethernet in an engineering building for students,
and another Ethernet in an administrative building for administrators.
Further suppose that you want to link both of these nets into the
computing center in yet a third building, using some sort of campus
wide backbone.  If you want to be somewhat secure, you will need to
arrange bridges and gateways so that packets from the engineering
building are not seen on the network in the administrative building
and vice versa.  However, I don't really know of any good way to
keep the students from stealing each other's passwords by looking
at all packets going by in the local engineering net.
(This is assuming a bright and agressive student who has access to
a reasonable work station on the network, of course).
  . . .
>[paraphrased] If you want to be somewhat secure, you will need to
>arrange bridges and gateways so that packets from the administrative network

>However, I don't really know of any good way to keep the students

End-to-end encryption, of course. The whole problem is, as you say,
that anyone who wants to dump packets, can. This is not a limitation
of IP networks, alone. In any network if you know, or can reverse
engineer the packets, you can get at unencrypted data contained in
them. The minute someone logs in over the network, their password
is insecure.

The "simple" solutions are to encrypt packet contents, provide
security at a network (rather than host), level (a la Kerberos),
or scramble packets so that someone cannot reassemble them in
a meaningful order.

Even so, no network is secure from itself. The best that you can
hope for is to make it impractical or extremely unlikely that someone
will be able to violate your security in a meaningful time frame.
Even THAT won't keep people from using their phone numbers, mother's
name, or favorite team as a password, or even simpler, giving it
to someone else to use or writing down and taping it to the underside
of the keyboard.

The second part of the story, however, is why be secure and how
secure? What I mean is, is your desire to be secure in order to
thwart deliberate malice or is it to limit your liability for
negligent disclosure of confidential records? In the case of
liability, your requirements might be significantly less stringent
than if you were transmitting launch codes for ICBMs.
  . . .
We are also allowing TCPIP to proliferate on campus and will have some
administrative access in several months using TCP/IP.  As long as we
have a router between public access labs and the main backbone, they
will not be able to see passwords.  Even for taps they would only see
passwords on that segment.

We assume that all of the problems of access control remain, but are no
more serious than the ones already created by dialup access.
  . . .
The most powerful weapon to avoid ethernet snooping is physical segmentation
of the network. Snoopers cannot read data that does not flow thru their
ethernet. Break the network into many small pieces, and snoopers can at most
see only what is on their small piece. Isolate sensitive users from others,
on different segments. Never combine public PCs and administrative users on the
same segment, for example. Multi-user computers are in general not a problem;
it is the single-user systems where a user may install and use snooping
capability without detection.
  . . .
You might want to install MVS TCP/IP and have the admin users come in via
that method. If they need access to VM, run VM/VTAM across a virtual CTCA.
MVS TCP/IP has a much better interface to VTAM/CICS, and is much easier to
keep unauthorized data secure by enforcing the CICS terminal transaction
restrictions.

If you do the DIAL method and your MVS applications do port-based security
for sensitive functions, how do you ensure that J. Random Bozo doesn't
DIAL MVS and end up facing a potentially highly priviledged logon screen.
(We got nailed with this one on our library system) DIAL is a simple rotor
system and (without VMSECURE or RACF) just dumps you into the next free
SPECIAL port.

Other than keeping the physical cable secure, we don't worry too much about
it. Such traffic never leaves our site, and since MVS TCP assiciates a login
name with a list of authorized "ports", it seems to have fixed most of the
big gaping holes.
  . . .
	I remember reading (handwave: about 2 years ago, in RISKS-DIGEST)
about a hospital which was putting in a network.  They had pretty much
decided on ethernet, when some suit found out about collisions: "You mean
sometimes data is transmitted and network errors cause it to be lost!?  We
can't have any data get lost in a hospital!"  And so they decided that they
couldn't use ethernet.
  . . .
For those of you wishing to see what other universities are/have
done, please use the archives here.  I maintain an 'ethics' col-
lection here at UNM from the world's universities.  All entries
have been submitted for posting by different universities and
authors.  You may email or postal mail me your submissions to the
collection.  And you may obtain any policy by 'anonymous' ftp
to unma.unm.edu, the directory is ethics.  The index is 00.INDEX.
I hope this helps.  And yes, I will have it LISTSERV available
soon.
  . . .
We are in much the same boat here at New Mexico State Univ. There is
a tremendous amount of concern over opening up network access to
student records, payroll/personnel, and financial data.
Our solution was to encrypt all traffic coming in to the MVS system
using some kind of VAXstation encryption gizmo. This
sledgehammer approach is only feasible because 1) our
MVS runs on a separate CPU (so only the *currently* smaller
Administrative community has to get encryption units)
and 2) there is no requirement for
general-purpose interactive access to MVS (we only run batch and
administrative CICS, no TSO). In other words, our primary requirement
is TELNET and FTP access to a "secure" (as opposed to
"secure + general purpose") system, so we can get away with
requiring that all traffic be encrypted.
This is obviously a short-term stop-gap, but we hope it will
last until something like Kerberos becomes generally available.
  . . .
     My recommendation:

          When in doubt, encrypt.
  . . .
A key point would be to keep the administrative traffic off of other
segments of the Ethernet by using bridges.  Otherwise,  it is a simple
matter for someone with a PC on the Ethernet to obtain some public domain
software and trap all of the packets they want.

Using routers and subnets can help even more.  You could put all of the admin.
users on a particular subnet and help prevent people on the main network from
using their IP addresses.

You could also use token-ring to connect your administrative users.  That would
go a long way to keep traffic out of the wrong hands.
  . . .
I am at the University of ****** - Office of the President. At this time I
do not have anything to suggest, but I would like to get a summary of what you
are getting and what you may do. The U* system has nine campuses, at least a
couple of them are in a similar position (campus-wide TCP/IP net for academics
and students, etc.). Thank you.
  . . .
==============================================================================
At this point it appears that we will permit limited Administrative traffic
on our campus net, with the following provisions:

 * Bridges will be used to limit users to local subnets.  No unsecure
      nodes will be allowed directly on the backbone.

 * The backbone and as many other links as feasible will be optical fiber.

 * We anticipate installing the MVS TCPIP product and to make it the primary
      Administrative link.

 * Highly sensitive applications (payroll/grades update, etc) will NOT
      be permitted to be accessed through the campus internet link.

 * Periodic reviews of the network topology with emphasis on network
      integrity and security will be performed.

Once again thank you all for your responses.

extension & strike), and communication center vault doors. But
remember, anything can be gotten into if you have enough time.

A Mosler can be drilled. It is not an easy task. We go to great lengths
to try and get it open before we give up and drill. It takes from four
to 8 hours, IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING. We bring lots of bits, but
typically use big enough drill motors that they give little trouble
(except when you want to lift one ;-}) If you it do it correctly, the
container can be repaired and reused. If you screw up (or burn it
open), you will need a new control drawer. ($$$$)

There is a difference between a vault and a safe.  The mosler safe that
we use could be picked up and carried off if you had a small crane
and unbolted it from the floor I guess... It is not a vault, in that 
it is not a room, part of a building, with a large door on it.

In 'drilling a vault' and it causing the bars at the edges to be released,
if the door is in the locked position already, the bars should already
be released and in the jamb.  I can't see where they could become 
'more released'...  As to the door being unusable, the only way to 
do that would be to have a vault door that had thermite bars and 
cause itself to weld shut if it thought it was being tampered with.

The doors being asbestos filled, some are and some use a foam ceramic
that is pretty neat.  Something like space shuttle tiles...  Still, 
a torch (the right kind) would have no real problem cutting through,
nor would a cut-away wheel of correct hardness.  You just have to spend a 
lot of time and energy.  Our mosler is not fireproof, though the 
secure file is.  The file is asbestos lined, which is most likely a 
problem for some government agency or another, though I don't spend
any great amount of time in the safe  ;-)  so I guess it doesn't 
scare me too much.  

If you have a vault, in most cases it makes more sense to go through 
the wall(s), floor, or ceiling.  They take precautions, of course, 
but seldom to the level that they do with the door.  Remember, the 
real reason for the door is psychological;  it looks so mean and 
heavy that nobody would believe that they could get through it.
Not believing they can do it, they never try, and thus never do!
Otherwise, wouldn't it be much more plain, and hiden away where people
couldn't see it?

Subj:	[376] Computer monitoring

What are the policies at your institution concerning monitoring of mail and
other inbound files, as well as interactive chatting (TALK, TELL, IRC, etc)?

Would you consider it a violation of personal security if your mail and
chatting was being monitored by your institution?
                Just a couple of questions as food for thought.

Subj:	[751] Bibliographic references for system breaches

Noel asked about any bibliographic references concerning actual or
potential breaches of computer security. Since s/he did not list an
e-mail address I'll reply via this discussion group.

"The Cuckoo's Egg" by Cliff Stoll just came out and is an interesting case
study of breaches of long duration of both academic and military
systems (including companies doing business with the military such
as BBN, TRW and MITRE).  Stoll's efforts to alert various groups met with
a fair number of responses that can be characterized only as denial.

Subj:	[1123] Re: Alarm Tripping, Home Alarm Installation

A frequent culprit in false alarms is moisture somewhere in the loop.
"Take this simple quiz!"

1.  Do you notice a higher incidence of false alarms during rainy
    weather, or in high humidity situations?

2.  Have you done (or had done) any plumbing recently?

3.  Condensation buildup on windows can seep into the surrounding
    woodwork and play havoc with bare splices that touch that wood.
    Do your windows 'fog up' now more than they did two months ago?

4.  The staples you used -- were they insulated (paper or plastic)?
    Piercing the wire or crushing the jacket can easily cause your
    wonderful hidden problems.

5.  Damp wood may be swelling up and putting a strain on a poorly
    made joint.

To isolate your problem, you may consider connecting up each device
on its own independent loop, or putting two or three on each loop
until you can narrow it down to which device is failing.  Then,
test the individual wiring and device, and repair or replace as
needed.

Hope this helps,

I was wondering where I could get the unit patches (uniform) of the

am trying to build a collection of patches. Any and all help would
be greatly appreciated....

Subj:	[803] RE: Universal Card System

At washington university (st louis) we have a number of different
cards, not a universal card.  Student ID's have recently switched to
a mag-strip, used for validation in the cashier's office and for access
to athletic facilities, special events, etc.  The same card is used in
the library.  A different card is available for purchase and use in
laser printers and photocopy machines; money can be added as necessary.
A similar, but separate card is used by the food service for students
on meal plans; money is deducted from the card with each meal purchased
and additional credit can be purchased.  A Universal card would certainly
be useful, from my point of view, but would have significant administrative
problems since the various cards currently are controlled by several
different departments.

It does not even have to be computerized.

The Chicago police department has a squad called the "gun squad" which
confiscates unregistered handguns.  It is enormously successful in
terms of the number of handguns seized.  Reportedly one of the Chicago
PD's techniques is to acquire lists of legally purchased handguns,
which were purchased oustside of Chicago.  These lists include the name
and address of the purchaser.  The Chicago PD then checks the names on
the lists against the names of store and resturant owners whose places
of business are located in Chicago.  When a match is found, the place
of business is searched.  Since it is a public place, no search warrent
is needed.  If a handgun is found on the premises, it is seized.

These lists are acquired from the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms (BATF).  BATF assembles these lists by inspecting the records
of gun shops near, but outside of, Chicago.  It is a federal
requirement that all firearm purchases be recorded, and the gun shops
can not refuse BATF access to the records.

In all probability, part of your library's budget is federal money.  If
a federal agency wants access to such information, it will have
powerful tools for compelling complience.  Once the feds have the data,
they can do whatever they want with it, including giving it to a third
party.

If your library keeps track of what information you access, for
whatever reason, you have no real guarantee that it will not be
misused.
