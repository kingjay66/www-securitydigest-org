		Introduction to Security

	An Introduction to Computer Security For Lawyers

(Most of the examples in this article are based on actual events.)

A small business has its accounting records erased by a malicious
high school student using a home computer and a modem. Did the business
take reasonable security precautions to prevent this sort of damage?

A friend gives you a public domain program which greatly improves your
computer's performance. One day, you find that the program has stopped
working, along with all of your wordprocessor, spreadsheet and
database programs.

It is important for legal practitioners to understand issues
of computer security, both for the protection of their own interests
and the interests of their clients. Lawyers today must automatically
recognize insecure computer systems and lax operating procedures in
the same was as Lawyers now recognize poorly written contracts.
Additionally, as computers become more pervasive, more legal cases
will arise which revolve around issues of computer security. Unless 
familiar with the basic concepts of computer security, a lawyer
will not know how to approach the question.

Not being a lawyer, the author will not attempt to address the legal
aspects surrounding computer security. Instead, the goal of this
article is to convey to the reader a basic understanding of the
technical issues in the field. Even a simple understanding of computer
security will afford the average lawyer protection from the accidental
loss or theft of documents and data stored in the firm's computer
systems, and allow the lawyer to begin to evaluate cases in which
bypassing of computer security is of primary interest.

This article attempts to broadly cover questions of computer security
in the small business or law firm. Because of its objectives, this
article is not a step-by-step guide on how to make a law firm
computer more secure: Instead, this article hopes to acquaint the
reader with the issues involved so that the reader may then be able
to analyze systems on a case-by-case basis and recognize when outside
assistance is required. 

Simply defined, computer security is the process, procedures, or
tools which assure that data entered into a computer today will be
retrievable at a later time by, and only by, those authorized to do
so. The procedures should additionally include systems by which
computer system managers (simply ``management'' on future references)
will be notified when attempts at penetrating security are made.
Security is violated when some person or persons (the ``subverter'')
succeedes in retrieving data without authorization. Security is also
breached when the subverter manages to destroy
or altering data belonging to others, making
retrieval of the original data impossible.

Although a substantial effort has been spent in the academic and
computer research communities exploring issues of computer security,
little of what is understood has been put into practice on a wide
scale. Computers are not inherently insecure, but there is a great
temptation to build and run computers with lax security procedures,
since this often results in simpler and faster operation. If security
considerations are built into a product from the beginning they are
relatively low cost; security added as an after-thought is often very
expensive. Additionally, many computer users are simply not aware of
how their facilities are insecure and how to rectify the situation.

	Who are the subverters?

It is a mistake to assume that all people bent on stealing or
destroying data can be grouped together and that similar defenses are
equally effective against all subverters.  In practice, the are two
major groups: those who want to steal data and those who wish to
destroy it. The first group can be called ``spies,'' the second group
can be called ``vandals'' or ``crackers.''  Different security
measures are targeted at each group.

Spies are sometimes exactly that: spies, either governmental or
corporate who stand to gain from the possession of confidential or
secret data.  Other times, spies are employees of the organization
that owns the computer -- employees who seek information in the
computer for personal advancement or blackmail. 

Crackers are typically adolescent boys who have a computer and a
modem. They are usually very intelligent and break into computer
systems for the challenge. They communicate with their friends via
computer bulletin boards, often using stolen ATT credit card or MCI
numbers to pay for the calls. On these boards, crackers report phone
numbers, user names, passwords and other information regarding
computer systems they have ``discovered.'' Many crackers are aware that
their actions are illegal and cease them on their 18th birthday to
avoid criminal liability for their actions.
``Vandals'' describes a larger group which includes both crackers and
other people likely to vandalize data, such as disgruntled employees.

Computer security has two sets of mutual goals, each tailored to a
particular set of opponents. The first goal is to make the cost of
violating the computer security vastly greater than the value of the
data which might be stolen. This is designed to deter the spies, who
are interested in stealing data for its value. The second goal of
security is to to make it too difficult for crackers to gain access to a
computer system within a workable period of time.

	Three terms: operating system, accounts and passwords

The program which controls the basic operations of a computer is
referred to as the computer's ``operating system.'' Often the same
computer can be used to run several different operating systems (but
not simultaneously). For example, the IBM PC/AT can run either the
MSDOS operating system or Xenix, a Unix-based operating system. Under
these two operating systems, the PC/AT has completely different
behavior.

If a computer system is intended for use by many people, the operating
system must distinguish between users to prevent
them from interfering with each other. For example, most multi-user
operating systems will not allow one user to delete files belonging
to another user unless the second user gave explicitly permission.

Typically, each user of the computer is assigned an ``account.'' The
operating system then does not allow commands issued by the user of
one account to modify data which was created by another account.
Accounts are usually named with between one and eight letters or
numbers which are also called ``usernames.''  Typical usernames that
the author has had include ``simsong'', ``Garfinkel'', ``slg'',
``SIMSON'' and ``ML1744.'' 

Most operating systems require that a user enter both the account name
and a ``password'' in order to use the account. Account names are
generally public knowledge while passwords are secret, known only to
the user and the operating system. (Some operating systems make
passwords available to system management, an insecure practice which
will be explored in a later section.) Since the account can not be
used without the password the name of the account can be made public
knowledge. If a cracker does break into an account, only the password
needs to be changed. Knowing a person's username is mandatory in order
to exchange electronic mail.

	How much security?

In most computer systems, security is purchased at a cost in system
performance, ease of use, complexity and management time. Many
government systems have a full time ``security officer'' whose job is
to supervise and monitor the security operations of the computer
facility. Many universities are also extremely concerned about
security, since they are well-marked targets for crackers in the
surrounding community. Most businesses, however, are notoriously lax
in their security practices, largely out of ignorance and a lack of
direct experience.

Security exists in many forms: An operating system may be programmed
to prevent users from reading data they are not authorized to access.
Security may be procedures followed by computer users, such as
disposing of all printouts and unusable magnetic media in shredders or
incinerators. Security may be in the form of alarms and logs which
tell the management when a break-in is attempted and/or successful.
Security may be a function of hiring procedures which require
extensive security checks of employees before allowing them to access
confidential data. Lastly, security may be in the form of physical
security, such as locks on doors and alarm systems intended to protect
the equipment and media from theft.

In a secure environment, the many types and layers of security are
used to reinforce each other, with the hope that if one layer fails
another layer will prevent or minimize the damage.  Established
protocol and judgment are required to determine the amount and cost
of security which a particular organization's data warrant.

	Security through obscurity

Security through obscurity is the reliance upon little known and
often unchangeable artifacts for security. Security
through obscurity is not a form of security, although it is often
mistaken for such. Usually no mechanism informs site management that the
``security'' has been circumvented. Often intrusions are not detected
until significant damage has been done or the intruder gets careless.
Once damage is detected,
management has little choice but to choose a new security system which
does not depend on obscurity for its strength.

The classic example of security through obscurity is the family that
hides the key to the front door under the ``Welcome'' mat. The only
thing to stop a burglar from entering the house is the ignorance that
there is a hidden key and its location -- that is, the key's
obscurity. If the house is burglarized and the burglar returns the
key to its original place, the family will have no way of knowing how
the burglar got in. If the family does change the location of the
hidden key, all the burglar needs to do is to find it again. A
higher level of
security would be achieved by disposing of the hidden key and issuing
keys to each member of the family.

For an example of security through obscurity on a computer, imagine the
owner of a small business who uses her IBM PC for both day-to-day
bookkeeping and management of employee records. In an attempt to keep
the employee records hidden from his employees, she labels the disk
``DOS 1.0 BACKUP DISK.'' The owner's hope is that none of the employees
will be interested in the disk after reading the label. Although the
label may indeed disinterest inquisitive employees, there
are far better ways to secure the disk (such as locking it in a file
cabinet).

In a second example of security through obscurity, a secretary stores
personal correspondence on her office wordprocessor. To hide the
documents' existence, she chooses filenames for them such as MEMO1,
MEMO2, ..., and sets the first three pages of the documents to be the
actual text of old, inter-office memos. Her private letters are
obscurely hidden after the old memos. Once her system is discovered,
none of her correspondence is secure.

	Physical Security

Physical security refers to devices and procedures used to protect
computer hardware and media. Physical security is the most important
aspect of computer security. Because of the similarities
between computers and other physical objects, physical security is
the aspect of computer which is best understood.

Like typewriters and furniture, office computers are targets for
theft. But unlike typewriters and furniture, the cost of a computer
theft can be many times the dollar value of the equipment stolen.
Often, the dollar value of the data stored inside a computer far
exceeds the value of the computer itself. Very strict precautions
must be taken to insure that computer equipment is not stolen by
casual thieves.

	Hardware

A variety of devices are available to physically secure computers and
computer equipment in place. Examples are security plates which mount
underneath a computer and attach it to the table that it rests on.
Other approaches include the use of heavy-duty cables threaded
through holes in the computer's cabinet. It is important,
when installing such a restraining device, to assure that they
will not damage or interfere with the operation of the computer (more
than one installation has had workmen drill holes through circuit
boards to bolt them down to tables.)

	Backups

To ``back up'' information means to make a copy of it from one place to
another. The copy, or ``backup,'' is saved in a safe place. In the
event that the original is lost, the backup can be used.

Backups should be performed regularly to protect the user from loss of
data resulting from hardware malfunction. Improved reliability is a
kind of security, in that it helps to assure that data stored today
will be accessible tomorrow. The subverter in such an event might be a
the faulty chip or power spike. Backups stored off site provide
insurance against fire.

Backups are also vital in defending against human subverters. If a
computer is stolen, the only copy of the data it contained will be
on the backup, which can then be restored on another computer. If a
cracker breaks into a computer system and erases all of the files,
the backups can be restored, assuming that the cracker does not have
access to or knowledge of the backups. 

But backups are a potential security problem. Backups are
targets for theft by spies, since they can contain exact copies of
confidential information. Indeed, backups warrant greater physical
security than the computer system, since the theft of a backup
will not be noticed as quickly as the theft of media containing working
data. 

With recognition of the potential security hole of backups, some
computer systems allow users to
prevent specific files  from being backed up at all.
Such action is justified when the potential cost of having a
backup tape containing the data stolen is greater than the potential
cost of losing the data due to equipment malfunction, or when the data
stored on the computer is itself a copy of secure master source, such
as a tape in a file cabinet.

	Sanitizing

Floppy disks and tapes grow old and are often discarded. Hard disks
are removed from service and returned enact to the manufacture for
repair or periodic maintenance. Disk packs costing 
thousands of dollars are removed from equipment and resold. If these
media ever contained confidential data, special precautions must be
taken to ensure that no traces of the data remain on the media after
disposal. This process is called ``sanitizing.'' To understand
sanitizing, first it is necessary to understand how information is
recorded on magnetic media:

The typical PC floppy disk can store approximately 360 thousand
characters. Each of these each of these characters consists of 8
binary digits, called ``bits,'' which can be set to ``0'' or ``1.''
Information on the disk is arranged into files. One part of the
disk, called the directory, is used to list the name and location of
every file.

Using the operating system's delete-file command (such as the MSDOS
``erase'' command) is not sufficient to insure that data stored cannot
be recovered by skilled operators. Most delete-file commands do not
actually erase the target file from a diskette: instead, the command
merely erases the name of the file from the diskette's directory. This
action frees the storage area occupied by the file for use but does
not modify the data in any way.
The file itself remains intact and can be recovered at a later time
if it has not been overwritten. Many programs exist on the
market to do just this.

Even if the actual file contents are overwritten or erased -- that is,
even if all of the bits used to store the contents of the file are
set to ``0'' -- it is still possible to recover the original
data, although not with normal operating procedures.

Imagine a black and white checkerboard used for a computer memory.
Assume that the value of any square on the checkerboard is
proportional to the darkness of the square: the black squares are 1s
and the white squares are 0s. Now consider what happens when the
checkerboard is painted with one coat of white paint: the original
checkerboard pattern is still discernible, but less so.  The squares
which formerly had a value of 1 now evaluate to 0.1 or 0.2. When the
computer reads the memory, the 0.1 or 0.2 are rounded to 0. But an
expert with special equipment could easily recover the original
pattern.

Just as the pattern can be recovered from a checkerboard uniformly
painted, data can be recovered from a floppy disk which has been
uniformly erased or reformatted.  Typical sanitization procedures
involve writing a 1 to every location on the media, then to write a 0
to every location, then to fill the media with random data. To use
the checkerboard analogy, this would be the same as painting the board
black, then white, then with a different checkered  pattern. The
original pattern should then be undetectable. Additional effort
might be desired when dealing with very sensitive data.

Sanitizing is obviously an expensive and time consuming process.
Physical destruction of the media represents an attractive
alternative -- simply feeding the floppy disk (or the checkerboard)
into a paper shredder does very well. Unfortunately, physical
destruction is not economically possible with expensive media which
must be returned for service or for resale in order to recover
costs of purchase.

	Authentication

Authentication is the process by which the computer system verifies
that a user is who the user claims to be, and vice versa.
Systems of authentication are usually classified as being based on:

 Something the user has. (keys)

 Something the user knows. (passwords)

 Something the user is. (fingerprints)

	Passwords

A password is a secret word or phrase which should be known only to
the user and the computer. When the user attempts to use the computer,
he must first enter the password. The computer compares the typed password
to the stored password and, if they match, allows the user access.

Some computer systems allow management access to the list of stored
passwords; doing so is generally regarded as an unsound practice.  If
a cracker gained access to such a list, every password on the computer
system would have to be changed. Other computers store passwords after
they have been processed by a non-invertible mathematical function.
The user's typed password cannot be derived by the processed
password, eliminating the damage resulting from the theft of the
master password list. The password that the user types when attempting
to log on is then transformed with the same mathematical function and
the two processed passwords are compared for equality.

	What makes a secure password?

Insecure passwords are passwords which are easy for people  to guess.
Examples of these include passwords which are the same
as usernames, common first or last names, passwords of four
characters or less, and English words (all english words, even long
ones like ``cinnamon.'').  

A few years ago, the typical cracker would spend many hours at his
keyboard trying password after password. Today, crackers have
automated this search with personal computers. The cracker can
program his computer to try every word in a large file.  Typically, these
files consist of thirty thousand word dictionaries, lists of first and
last names and easy-to-remember keyboard patterns.
