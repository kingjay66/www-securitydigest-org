Subj:	[1205]  Important bit of administrivia

A while back I mentioned that red.rutgers.edu, our last 20, is being
decomissioned and rolled out in Febrary [Snif!].  I now know which host
will serve as a replacement distribution point for the Security list --
this one, aim.rutgers.edu.  I've found that PMDF can suck up the entire
list in one gulp and not complain, and there's Gnu emacs to do the
editing hair with, so it should work out just fine.

Thus, this is the official announcement:  Security is moving.  Please
send all further submissions to security@aim.rutgers.edu, and administrative
matters to security-request@aim.rutgers.edu.  Archives will now live at
this site in <security>security.mail, in pseudo-VMS format.  To FTP files
from here, connect and log in as GUEST with no password.  The entry for this
list in interest-groups.txt will also eventually change as well.  You may
see a couple more messages forwarded from Red before the changeover is done.

Security@rutgers.edu or rutgers.arpa should also continue to work, but use of
this path is discouraged because "rutgers.rutgers.edu" is a small Sun dedicated
to lots of mail traffic, and has a perpetual load of over 10 or so.

Here's to fast networks and capable mailers,

Subj:	[1559]  Reagan Signs Bill Governing Computer Data

[Repeated without permission from the business section of
_The_Washington_Post_ of Saturday, Jan 9, 1988]

[headlined] Reagan Signs Bill Governing Computer Data

President Reagan yesterday signed a bill intended to tighten security of
computer systems that store nonclassified data such as census, tax and
business records.  The National Bureau of Standards is to develop programs to
protect the machines from being illegally tapped by outsiders.

The law overrides a national security directive that Reagan issued in 1984
giving the Pentagon's National Security Agency responsibility for safe-
guarding the data.  Later, the White House created a new classification of
data for protection -- "sensitive but unclassified."

The measures led to criticism in Congress that the government was tightening
the flow of information and expanding military authority.  The new law places
responsibility for civilian computer security in civilian hands, but provides
for the NSA to give technical advice to the bureau.  The law also specifies
that nothing in it will be used to restrict disclosures under the Freedom of
Information Act.

Subj:	[18894]  distribution of sensitive software like DES

A recent discussion of DES software distribution on one
of the Bitnet mailing lists came to a definitive resolution.
Since this seems to be security related, I thought the

Subject: Export control does *NOT* apply to publicly available software.
To: info-futures@bu-cs.bu.edu

I researched this topic pretty thoroughly last year, by going down to the
local Federal Building and wading through the rulebooks in Commerce Dept.
library.  What prompted me to do it was that I had a PD DES, that I had
posted to comp.sources.unix, which a Canadian reader claimed was in
violation of export laws.

Rich $alz took the info I got and talked with the NSA (US National
Security Agency) and some Boston-area cryptographers.  The upshot was
that NSA never came up with anything that contradicted the rules I
found, and Rich posted not only the DES code, for worldwide distribution,
but also the "crypt breaker's workbench" that decrypts the ancient Unix
"crypt" command.

Now, the way things wag with NSA is that if you ask them "Can I do this?"
the answer is almost always "No".  What you have to say is "Show me the rules
that say I can't do this.  I have some that say I can."  The courts have
regularly ruled that the government cannot enforce a policy which is not
written down and equally applied to everyone (it's called "secret law").
So if what *is* written down supports you, they are stuck with it.  They
can't secretly make new laws and tell you later that you broke them.

Since everyone else on this topic is shooting off their mouth without
having done any research (now we have *two* Canadians who are falsely telling
us what the US export law is -- thanks guys!), I figured I'd better post
my full references to make it credible.  Save this message; if I ever leave
the net somebody had better have a copy to shout down the clowns again.

Subject: There are basically no export controls on public domain information.
Date: 3 Oct 86 23:57:06 GMT

I got into a hassle last month for posting a DES program to mod.sources
because someone claimed that I was breaking the export control law.

I spent the afternoon down at the Federal Building and discovered that
export policy is in better shape than I thought.  Basically, you can
export any technical data to any destination if it "has been made
generally available to the public in any form".  This export is under
a "general license" which is available to everyone without any paperwork.

So, you should expect to see the DES posting again (it was canceled)
and to see Crypt Breaker's Workbench on mod.sources soon.

Here are the regs for all you policy hounds:

Export Administration Regulations, Part 370.2, Definitions.

        "General License.  A license established by the US Department
        of Commerce for which no application is required and for which
        no document is granted or issued.  It is available for use by
        all persons, except those listed in and prohibited by the
        provisions of Supplement No. 1 to Part 388, and permits export
        within the provisions thereof as prescribed in the Export
        Administration Regulations.  These general licenses are not
        applicable to exports under the licensing jurisdiction of agencies
        other than the Department of Commerce."

Part 379.1, Definitions.
        "...  All software is technical data."

Part 379.2, Licenses to Export.
        "Except as provided in Part 370.3(a), an export of technical
        data must be made under either a US Department of Commerce
        general license or a validated export license.  General
        licenses GTDA and GTDR apply to specific types of exports of
        technical data..."

Part 379.3, General license GTDA: Technical Data Available to all
Destinations.
        "A General License designated GTDA is hereby established
        authorizing the export to all destinations of technical data
        described in 379.3(a), (b), or (c) below:

                (a) Data Generally Available

        Data that have been made generally available to the public in
        any form, including--

        (1) Data released orally or visually at open conferences,
        lectures, trade shows, or other media open to the public; and

        (2) Publications that may be purchased without restrictions
        at a nominal cost, or obtained without costs, or are readily
        available at libraries open to the public.

        The term "nominal cost" as used in 379.3(a)(2) above, is intended
        to reflect realistically only the cost of preparing and distributing
        the publication and not the intrinsic value of the technical data.
        If the cost is such as to prevent the technical data from being
        generally available to the public, General License GTDA would not
        be applicable.

                (b)  Scientific or Educational Data ...

Chris Lewis is still somewhat concerned about export control.  I will
try to explain the things he mentioned in his message of 8 October.

It lists people who have abused the general license in circumstances
where it does not apply (eg shipping Vaxen to Russia).  The idea is that
you are innocent until proven guilty with regards to general licenses.
I looked in the supplement and it was a 3-page list of names and cities.
I was not on it.  :-)

>>      within the provisions thereof as prescribed in the Export

I also got myself a copy of the regulations on cryptographic material
export, but I didn't include it in my posting since it did not apply.
It's listed under Part 399.1, supplement #1 (the Commodity Control
List), "ECCN 1527A".  It mentions that computers when combined with
cryptographic software are covered under this ECCN, and says "Technical
Note:  No technical data or software controlled under this ECCN may be
exported or reexported under General License GTDR."  HOWEVER, we are
exporting under General License GTDA, not GTDR, and this is a valid
distinction.  There is nothing in this ECCN section that precludes
shipping cryptographic technical data (e.g. software) under general
license GTDA.  It also says, "Exporters requesting a VALIDATED LICENSE
from the Department of Commerce must provide a statement from the
Department of State, Office of Munitions Control, verifying that the
equipment intended for export is under the licensing jurisdiction of
the Department of Commerce." (emphasis mine)  However, we are not
requesting a validated license, we are using the general license, so
this requirement does not apply either.

In summary, I believe that the provisions of ECCN 1527A do not apply to
public domain software, and we are OK.  (I don't know of any other ECCN
sections that apply either.)

(1)  You elided the relevent section of the general license definition.
"(a) Data Generally Available: Data the have been made generally
available to the public IN ANY FORM, including... (1) and (2)...".
(emphasis mine.)  If something has been placed into the public domain
and its location advertised to the Usenet community, or placed into
a publicly accessible bulletin board, or posted to the Usenet, I claim
that it has been made generally available to the public.  (1) and (2)
are not the only ways something can be made available to the public;
they are just examples.

(2)  You can't be expected to know how things work in the U.S., being
Canadian, but there is NO requirement that "journals are supposed to be
reviewed prior to publication".  We have a free press here.  They tried
to impose something like this and it didn't work.  There is a
"voluntary" system whereby authors can submit manuscripts to the NSA
for review, but you are not even bound by the result -- they can only
make suggestions.  Mostly this is so they can recommend that you delete
certain phrases that might give away what they are working on, and you
are supposed to feel patriotic enough to go along.  Presumably they
could also try to go to court to stop you from publishing, but I don't
think that has happened to any paper that has been voluntarily
submitted under this program.  (They did go to court against the
magazine that published the "how to build an atom bomb" article.)

You may be confused between mandatory review of journals and the
Defense Department's right to review articles by people who they fund.
If you are doing government-sponsored research, they can write the
contract such that they get to OK any release of information derived
from the sponsored research.  But if I invent something on my own,
without gov't money, I can publish it.

(3)  Public Domain-ness is a state of ownership.  Since you can
certainly own a DES program (e.g. AMD owns the copyright of the 8068
DES chip; ATT owns crypt(1)), you can also renounce its ownership and
place it into the public domain.

>You didn't include anything from 370.3 (or is that a typo?) either.

It was not a typo.  I don't have a copy of it here, but I don't think
it applies to us.  It's part of the "General Policy on Exports" section.

This objection is covered above -- there is no required government
review of publications here, and no government approval is required to
publish.

Actually, this is not relevant.  The export control regs don't mention
DES at all.  They say "cryptographic equipment...designed to ensure
secrecy of communications...or of stored information...and "software"...
performing the functions of such cryptographic equipment", and then
make a few exemptions for things like simple scrambled voice, video, or
fax.

None of the above stuff is "technical data generally available to the
public", so it cannot be exported under the GTDA general license.  Note
that journal articles like the AT&T Tech Journal one on breaking crypt
are generally available to the public, and they are being exported
without trouble.  Ditto for _Cryptologia_.  It *DOES* take an export
license to export non-public technical data, e.g. the Unix crypt
command (licensed software), encryption boards (hardware, not
technical data), etc.

I must say that I felt the same way you do about this -- I had a general
feeling that exporting this stuff was illegal, even though I thought it
should be legal -- until I spent the time to research it.  My opinion of
the people who wrote US export law has gone up significantly.  They
really believe that if the US "public" can get it, it is exportable.

FYI, here is the definitive story on how the "export restrictions on
crypt" came about, from Dennis Ritchie himself.  As you can see, no
government agency ever said it could not be exported; AT&T and DEC
simply decided that applying for an export license was too much trouble.
I've also included a message from Gordon Moffett who says that Amdahl
is now exporting Unix with the crypt command without trouble.

Subject: export controls
Date: 18 Sep 84 05:15:46 GMT
Posted: Mon Sep 17 22:15:46 1984

As has been said, there is indeed a special "International Edition"
of System V that differs from the ordinary system in that it
lacks the crypt command, the encrypting features of ed and vi, and the
encrypt entry of crypt (3).  The crypt entry, which is used for
passwords, is there, as is the underlying DES algorithm.

Here's how it happened.

About a year ago, I got mail from Armando Stettner saying basically,
"Do you know of any problems with exporting crypt?  Our lawyers
[at DEC] are worried about it."  I replied that such worries were
utterly unfounded for a variety of sensible reasons.

Now, as it has turned out, DEC was very justified in worrying about
export controls in general; they have recently been fined (I think) $500,000
for the Vaxen that almost got sent to Russia.  I conjecture that
the earliest stages of this or a similar incident were already in progress
and they were trying to be extra careful when they learned about crypt.

At any rate, the DEC lawyers communicated their fears to AT&T,
and the AT&T lawyers, equally cautious, sought government advice.

The problem, you see, is that cryptographic materials are under export
control.  There is a thing called the Munitions Control Board that worries
not only about machine guns going to Libya, but also about the crypt
command going to England.  In practice, the enforcement is done by the
Commerce department.

AT&T had a meeting with Commerce, the MCB, and NSA.  The upshot was
that they decided it would be simplest all around just not to export
the crypt command.  The gov't would almost certainly have granted
the license, but (probably wisely) AT&T decided it wasn't worth
the hassle.

In technical terms, the situation is ludicrous. The encrypt subroutine
is distinguished mainly by the excruciating care I took to make it
an exact transcription of the algorithm published in the Federal Register,
and by its slowness.   NBS, the caretaker of DES standardization,
is explicit that software implementations cannot be certified, so in that
sense encrypt is not "real" DES.  The underlying subroutine is still
there, only the simple command that uses it is missing.  So there is
actually nothing to protect, and even if there were, it's not protected.
Nevertheless, in the present situation we officially don't need
an export license, whereas with the crypt command we would.

In political terms, AT&T probably could have done better.  Conservative
and careful, they called a big meeting at which no one could possibly
have put forward anything but official positions about encryption
programs.  Private checking with well-placed people in the appropriate
agencies might well have done the job.  But who knows?

Subj:	[3035]  Re: Security msgs re: student PC labs

  Has anyone ever considered the cause of software piracy?  I have a
possible answer.  Though no one can condone software piracy I believe that
many software publishing houses are their own worst enemies.  If software
were priced within the reach of your average student, perhaps software
piracy on the part of students would decrease.  It is not your average
student that has over two or three hundred dollars to pay for legal copies
of many of the popular software packages used on campuses these days.
If these products were more reasonably priced, people, especially students,
might not feel as obliged to steel them.  My personal opinion is that it
takes a lot of nerve to charge such high amounts for any software package
for individual (non NETWORK) use.

More companies should use Borland as an example and price their software
as they do.  Also, many software publishers claim large losses due to soft-
ware piracy.  I honestly wonder about the true losses involved.  Many people
I know who make thier living programming micro-computers learned their
trade in large part due to software they gained illegally.  Then when they
were out making money off this software, almost all purchased legal copies
of the software and now often recommend others to buy these popular software
packages.  So software companies should consider that while it is true that
they are being ripped off, at least their software is getting some publicity
and quite often generating dollars for them in the future.

   One other point should be considered.  How much does it cost a typical
software publisher to develop a challenging copy protection scheme?  Not
being a micro-computer user, I do not know the challenges involved in the
development of copy protection schemes.  I think copy protecting software
is silly.  It is like putting a dead bolt lock on a paper bag.  Why bother
considering the cost?  I know of many people who can break software without
even breaking a sweat.  Realistically, copy protection serves only one
purpose ... to incovenience legitamate owners of software.  Those who wish
to subvert copy protection will find a way to do so.  Instead of investing
time and energy into this silliness, why not just lower the cost of the
software or put more effort into perfecting the software?  So far, the vast
majority of software packages are not very good and could stand a lot more
improvement.

Please understand, that I DO NOT codone software piracy.  Also understand
that I do not condone consumer ripoffs via the outrageous prices charged
for poorly written, poorly developed, and often inadequate software.

Subj:	[2208]  Different type of key

I just saw an ad showing a type of key I had never seen before; this might
be old hat to many of you, but it's new to me, and I'm wondering if someone
could post a note identifying just what kind of key (and lock) this is.

The ad is on page 31 of the December '87 issue of Government Product News,
a tabloid-sized product-info and advertising freebie magazine aimed at
people who buy stuff for state, local, or federal government departments.

The ad is actually for a product that uses this key and lock as part of
its design -- a fuel-dispensing pump system which can keep track of the
fuel used by a particular vehicle in your fleet and prevent unauthorized
personnel from stealing fuel. They push this "unique coded key" as a
"pick-proof" method of control. Each vehicle has a differently coded
key, so the key not only opens the lock, but also identifies which
particular key is in use, so the automated inventory-control system can
keep track of how much fuel is going into which vehicle (assuming the
operator doesn't just fill a can or two extra each time... :-). The
company and product is the ITI Tri-Scan Fuel Management System, located
in Burlington, MA. (1-800-323-3265, or (617) 272-7233). The ad copy says
that the system is used extensively in Europe, so maybe this is a non-US
key and lock assembly.

Anyway, the key body is a solid tube with scoop-type notches cut or ground
out on the top and at least one side. (It appears roughly like a smooth ear
of corn with bites taken out here and there.) The picture shows only one
side, so I don't know if there are notches on the other side, too. The
bottom is smooth. The working part of the key looks to be about 2 1/2 inches
long. Anyone recognize this?

By the way, there is another locksmithing-oriented item in this issue;
on page 14 there is a blurb about a book, LOCKS & LOCKPICKING -- A BASIC
GUIDE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT, SECURITY, AND MILITARY. $10 from R&R Publishing
of Hermosa Beach, CA. "Completely revised and updated from a similar
manual of 8 years ago."

the powers-to-be are).  I choose 2 hours because most superusers or hackers
really can't destroy data before copying it somewhere for back-up.  If the 
data has truly been destroyed, then anytime frame is insufficient.  But if
it exists, the superusers are under pressure (deservedly so!!) to restore
the files.  (I'm not sure that I wouldn't also do step 3 even if the
files are restored.)

3-If the threat doesn't bring the data back, then present the document to the
dean.  If an apology AND a public policy isn't made, then escalate to the next
step.

4-Tell the local school paper and the local town paper.  The local school 
paper will present her side of the argument BEFORE the superusers.  In most
public presentations of arguments in an unemotional manner (facts, not 
feelings) will put the superusers in an awkward position.  Don't forget to
state your experience so the superusers can't show that your inexperience 
was the cause of the files being lost.

5-The school will probably react if the letter reaches the local area newspaper
because most schools "rent" or "lease" a portion of their computing power to 
local institutions to support workers doing research.  As an institution, I 
would be very displeased if I thought I might lose opportunities because of
some immature superusers.

The key to success is rational escalation.  While the timeframe is late
for immediate success, the superusers might learn an ancient phrase
"...hell hath no fury...".

Now for a management or a corporate point of view...

Everybody makes mistakes.  In this case, the superusers used poor judgment
based on the facts presented.  As a manager, I would allow one mistake due
to poor judgment or immaturity.  BUT THEY HAVE TO BE TOLD THAT THEY HAVE 
HAD THEIR MISTAKE!  The next one would be costly for the superusers.

When a superuser ABUSES the customer, it is time to re-evaluate the need
for that superuser.  The superuser is like the insider in the stockmarket,
he hears a lot of information but he is OBLIGED by law not to benefit by it.
A superuser can browse through a lot of data but he should do so by
invitation only!

Also, if you the customer want to be sure your files exist, you may have to
take the time yourself to make copies.  This is a risk that you have to
evaluate.  Books have been written on this subject so I won't expand here.

Subj:	[1620]  Pay phone thief again

This pay phone guy has made the big time: Weekly World News!  Right next to a 
diet ad...

Copyright (C) 1988 Weekly World News
Reprinted without permission

Phone ranger rips off $500,000 from booths
FBI dragnet is out for the nickel-&-dime desperado

    Cops have circulated wanted posters throughout the country for an elusive 
bandit who they say has ripped open pay phone coin boxes for seven years--and 
made off with $500,000.
    The phantom phone bandit has been identified in a fugitive FBI warrant as 
James Clark, 47, who brazenly uses the name "James Bell" and pays bills with 
mountains of coins.
    "He's about as slippery as they get," said Powell Caesar of Ohio Bell in 
Columbus, Ohio.
    "He's like a crooked Houdini.  There isn't a coin box he can't crack."
    Clark, a former machinist and die-maker from Ohio, drives a blue van, 
wears cowboy boots, gold-rimmed glasses and has a ponytail.
    A special tool allows him to open phone boxes, steal the coins and quietly 
slip away, say phone officials.  He's been doing it for seven years, making 
$70,000 a year tax free.
    "Every telephone company from California to New York State would like to 
nail his hide," said Caesar.  "Sooner or later he'll slip up and we'll be 
waiting."
    Police believe Clark is in Arizona, California or another western state.  
He's supposed to be armed with a .38 caliber pistol.
    The wanted posters offer rewards for information leading to his capture.

Subj:	[1784]  Tape-name schemas for large multi-cputype machine room tape libraries.

Hi!  I'm an operator at Carnegie-Mellon University Computing Services
department.  I am looking for information on how different organizations
physically identify magtapes.

We operate several different types of machines here (Dec-20s, VMS vaxes in
various sizes, and an IBM 3083 running VM/CMS).  The user-ids on these systems
has been a standard form: The user's first and last initial followed by single
digit number, followed by a single number or letter.  Mine, for instance, is
GM5B.

We maintain a large user and administrative tape library (approximately 3,700
user tapes, and about 1200 administrative tapes).  To physically identify each
tape, so  we can tell if the owner is the person trying to mount a tape, or
remove it from the tape library, we place an identifying label on the tape
case, which is the name people use when requesting a tape mount.  Tape names
are 6 characters: the first four are the owner's userid, and the last two are
unique identifying numbers or letters.  An example of a tape name might be
GM5BN2.  This worked very well until we got a UNIX system.  We now have a
system with userids that do not conform to the standard, and we will be
acquiring a tape drive for that system soon.  Therefore, we want to find out
how other sites identify tapes in their tape libraries, and particularly how
sites where the number of characters in userids varies identify their tapes.

Please mail replies to me, and, I'll post a summary of replies to this bboard.
Your help is greatly appreciated.

None of the electro-mechanical exchanges I've seen connect the audio
path until *after* the phone has been picked up...  (If there was,
you could just put a high pass filter on your line and get free
incoming phone calls:-)

As I understand it, the mode of operation of such devices is to send
the tone immediately *after* the called party has hung up, when an
audio path still exists.  The infinity transmitter then 'picks up'
the phone again to keep the line open. Only when the connection to
the subscriber is completely digital will this possibility go away.
(but lots of others will arise).

So if you get lots of `wrong numbers', and sometimes have difficulty
getting a dial tone...

Happy Paranoia!

Subj:	[6014]  Skip Tracing

   How would you go  about  finding  such  a  person?   The  obvious
   security  issue  here  is perhaps this person does not want to be
   found.  DMV records would be the first place I would  look,  then
   perhaps at Social Security.  But who has access to these records?
   
First, your specific questions:  The friend who left town 10 years ago
because the Hell's Angels were after him is easy.  He's not really trying
to hide from you; try asking his relatives.  You can get DMV records pretty
easily; they're public.  Social security records are very tightly held, but
you can try impersonating the subject and asking for "your" records (highly
illegal).  Almost no one is entitled to look at SS records.   Your female 
friend's marriage certificate (and divorce certificate, if any) is listed
in both her maiden and married names (see below).

One has very little in terms of legal right to privacy regarding where
one lives.  Many of the relevant records (land ownership, leases, etc.)
are either explicitly public or not protected at all.  Most of the measures
one might take to "disappear" involve name changes to evade debts and/or
false id, both of which are illegal.   How hard it is to find someone
depends really on how badly they want to be lost.  Most people are
relatively easy to find.

Doing a skip trace (as these investigations are generally called) usually
begins with some last known address.  You should first check the phone
book for a new number or address.  The phone books from nearby towns
are often helpful.  Unlisted numbers at least tell you what town the
subject is in, and there are (illegal) ways of finding them out.

For $1, the post office will tell you of any active forwarding address
for a year after the move.  You can also send mail to the last known
address with the inscription: "Do not forward: address correction
requested" and save yourself 78 cents.  The post office is also required
to give out the actual address of businesses operating through PO boxes.
You can claim that you bought something from the subject's PO box and have not
received it; that is usually enough to get the real address of the
boxholder.

There are also the Polk directories that list names and phone numbers
by address.  You can call some of the subject's old neighbors, and with
a suitable pretext, get potentially useful information about the subject.
These directories also indicate numbers that have changed since the last
publication, highlighting recent moves.

Public records can also be of great assistance.  Marriage records are
listed by both husband and wife's original names, so find the married
name of your old flame is pretty easy.  You also might consider looking
in local newspapers around the date of the marriage for announcements.
These are goldmines of information about friends, addresses, employers,
etc.  Divorce records are also useful and available. Traffic tickets are
a matter of public record, and almost everybody gets them now and then;
they have names and addresses on them.  Birth and other records may yield
a parent's address, which can be very useful in tracking children.  Many
other city or county records (property tax, fishing licenses, auto or
boat registration, etc.) may provide information.  Try the several cities
and counties around the last known address.  Most records can be had be anyone
for a small fee.  Some clerks may try to tell you you need some official
permission to look at files.  This is incorrect: local files are a matter
of public record and anyone is entitled to look.

Private records, such as credit records, Equifax (an insurance
investigator) files, medical and banking records and so on may all be
accessible to various degrees.  It depends on your connections to insiders
in those companies or the quality of your pretext in asking.  Sometimes
a little money helps.  If you know the subject's old employer,  they
may have useful records; they may even be the ones who transferred him
to a new city.

Interviewing people who may have known the subject before he moved can
be very helpful.  People in the neighborhood (friends, local grocery
store, gardeners, landlords, water company) may have information.
Relatives are generally very knowledgable.  Lots of local businesses may
have forwarding addresses on file for returning deposits or for final
bills: phone company, water, gas, electric, landlord, etc.

Some people who WANT to disappear use phony mail drops, or "rented"
addresses.  There are lists of such addresses in a publication called
the National Mail Drop Directory.  Many of the operators of these services
will help a tracer find a true address.  Phony ID is pretty easy to come
by in the US, but it is a rare case that completely drops out of his
old life, never seeing old friends, never talking to family, etc.  Lee
Lapin's book How to Get Anything on Anybody may provide a useful
introduction to running a more difficult investigation.

Lapin includes a great idea from a sting operation run by the NY police
that caught dozens of fugitives.  They sent letters to last known addresses
that read as follows:

  "Congratulations!  You have been selected to join FIST TOURS on their
   inaugural trip to Atlantic City.  You and a companion will be our 
   guest in Atlantic City for free.  You'll recieve $15 in quarters each and
   a buffet lunch at the Regency Lounge.  The tour is complete with drinks en
   route and wine and cheese on the return trip.
   
   Also a surprise, which is free.

   This is absolutely free to you and your guest.  All we ask is that you fill
   out the attached reply card.  Your trip will be leaving at [a certain place]
   but you must call to confirm your reservation...."

More than fifty felons went to jail for answering that letter ("Also a
surprise, which is free").  Happy Hunting!

immune to false alarms.  Also you can buy these gadgets hooked
to flood lights so that the lights come on when someone enters
the yard.

btw, driving over a coil does not cause a current to flow.  These
devices usually use the coil as an inductor.  Driving near the
coil changes its inductance.  The inductor may be part of
an oscillator thats freq depends on the inductance.

Subj:	[1349]  Re: Security msgs re: home security

The best solution I have found for home security at night, is to install an
infrared sensor which turns on spotlights and any type of noisemaker you want.
I installed one on our deck, near the garden, and it serves two purposes.
First, it detects any motion of a warm body (prowler) within its adjustable
range, and second, it detects racoons in the summer if the sensitivity is set
properly.  We have two spotlights and a Sonalert wired to the device so that we
are alerted if someone enters the field of detection and the racoons are scared
off by the light and high pitched sound of the Sonalert.  We were able to have
our own corn for the first time in years!  

The device can be used in the driveway to detect motion of a car or person
approaching the house and turn on a light or any other device you want.  As I
mentioned, the range and sensitivity can be adjusted.  It is capable of
detecting a car at 100 fet if adjusted for high sensitivity and detects a warm
body at 35-50 feet.  I bought ours at a local supply house called Hechingers
complete with the dual spotlight fixture for $34.95 last year.  I'm sure the
security houses sell them too, although I didn't check them out.

Subj:	[2769]  PC Lab security

Here at the Univ. of Ala. (in Tuscaloosa), we have a graphics lab in which
drawing students use ACAD 2.62 (among other programs).  To insure that
students won't "borrow" the software, we use the following procedure.....

The main program is called PC-Lock.  When this program is installed, the user
has to supply a password to access the hard disk.  IF they decide to boot up
with a DOS disk in drive "A", they are unable to access the hard drive.
Nortons Adv, PcTools, Explorer, Ultra-Util. and other programs return a
"Invalid Drive" message when used.  Also, using PC-Lock, CNTL-BRK can be turned
off permantly. :-) Then all one has to do is make a simple menu to run after
PC-Lock accepts a valid password.

   Advantages:  No multiple sub-directories or "hidden" sub-directories.

                Easy to write menus (use your favorite "freeware" menu pgm).

                Only way to get to hard disk is via the passwords..or, you
                can use DEBUG to format the drive again, (G=C800 and the such,
                however the data is lost.......    :-)

                You can use a total of 5 passwords (1 administrator and 4 user
                passwords).  ANY key combination is allowed...even backspaces.
                If a user messes up entering the password, striking ENTER gives
                him another chance.

Disadvantages:  You have to make some files "normal" again to edit them
                (adding new programs to the drive..etc).

                If a person happens to buy the program, (since he knows the
                passwords for that class) he can change them.  *BUT*, since
                the errorlevels passed will be the same, he/she/it still
                can't get to the software.  The supervisor can then enter
                his own password and change all of them to whatever he wants.

                Unlimited attempts at trying the passwords..however, it
                would take someone quite some time to figure out a 16
                character password.

                CTRL-ALT-DEL is removed from operation until the correct
                password is typed in.......

I'm not quite sure how PC-Lock works, but if you use FDISK, the hard drive is
seen as a non-DOS disk.....maybe it moves the FATs to another part of the disk?

                   Just though ya'll might be interested....

Subj:	[1861]  Security in PC labs.

Why mess with Floppy Disks at all, use a network.

I have been administering a PC network using Novell Netware, and overseeing
another for about a year now.  All the interesting stuff is on the network
file server where it's very convienient to access, and the .EXE files are
flagged EXECUTE ONLY.  The only thing you can do to an execute only file is
execute it and, if you're the system administrator, erase it.  All the extra
files associated with the program are marked SHARABLE READ ONLY ( with a
few annoying exceptions ).

If somebody does try to copy a program, they get everything except the .EXE
or the .COM file.  If they try to corrupt a program, they get a message
like "Access Denied."  Since all the files are bottled up inside the file
server, direct bios calls and the like won't get around the protection.

I mentioned annoying exceptions:

It seems some application programs read their .EXE files while they're
running.  If the file is set to Execute Only, they can't read it either, and
they usually report "EXE file not found," or something equally unhelpful.

Another trick Novell has is not permitting users to see a subdirectory.
When they do a DIR, the directory appears empty, and COPY *.* doesn't find
any files.  In order to copy a piece of software, they would have to explicitly
copy each file, and first they would have to find out all the filenames.
Unfortunately, some programs use directory search calls to find their files.

Novell's security system is quite transparent to well-behaved users, and if
carefully administered, very robust.

pain in the ass.  Both for us, since we would have to come up with a
copy protection scheme, and for our users.  And besides, we're
constantly improving the programs playing ability.  Liscensed users
get free upgrades, but if you steal a copy, eventually, you learn to
play better than it does, and then what do you do?  The policy seems
to work fine, since we are making money, or I have gotten paid, at any
rate.

However, come June, we are releasing a version for the NEC PC, the
IBMPC clone on the Japanese market (where we have a much larger
potential market than in the US).  However, the Japanese insist
that the software be copy protected, so we need a scheme.  So, does
anyone know any reasonable protection schemes, which are at least
slightly bothersome to thieves, but not too much of a pain to
implement.  If not, can anybody suggest where to look?

Concerning tracking down the useage of your Social Security number, I once
worked for a company that subscribed to Trans-Union credit checking.  This
company offered you the ability to do a social security number trace, where
any occurances of your social security number in the country that would occur
from things even as small as a declined credit application would show.

This command was merely typing in 'TRCE xxxyyzzzz' and it would come back
with all the occurances of that SS number, and the applicants and/or account
holders, as well as their current and previous addresses.

I distinctly remember several times doing this (we did it in order to see
if the individual had credit at another address, etc) and having more than
one person show up under the identical SS number, and although occasionally
it may have been due to a mis-typing on the part of the data entry person
originally, most of the time it belonged to an addressee somewhere in Florida
or California or New York with a seemingly foreign name.

All I could suggest is that you go to your local credit checking agency and
see if they use Trans-Union credit checking or a compatible one that would
offer such a service.

I suppose it is pretty common knowledge that the first three digits of your
Social Security number indicate where you were born.  We also used that in
order to verify job applications when doing a background check.

Subj:	[779] Re: distribution of sensitive software like DES

Just to show that these things tend not to work anyway;
on a U**x box near me there is a copy of the Unix `secretmail'
stuff (public key encrypted local mail). The manual entry has a big
notice saying `not to be exported'.
The same company does not export `crypt'.

Of course this is irrelevant, since we have licensed Unix source
which predates the ban; it includes both crypt and secretmail.

I think the argument used by DEC etc, that it would cost too much
is a bit odd. Have they ever calculated how much it costs to
make two different distributions of their software? And not-for-export
software gets distributed anyway....

Subj:	[1999] RE:  Secure labs with PC-LOCK

An interesting note on PC-lock was recently posted.  I have seen PC-LOCK in
use and am quite impressed with the actual design of the program ... can't
remember the person who wrote this fine program though.  The program gives
you enough security that only someone who understands hard disks and the 
PC computer will be able to break it.  There is no way that I know of to
break the security by brute force, although there is a very easy way to
by-pass it.  I am not sure if I should be revealing this way or not, but
security by non-disclosure is no security at all.

PC-LOCK writes a new master hard disk boot block, just like FDISK.  But this
one has its own boot code.  As well, you might notice that when you boot
from a floppy, the hard disk light goes on for a second ... dos is reading
the hard disk to try and determine if it is valid.  It knows if it is
valid by modifying the last two bytes (ID field)  from 55 AA (hex) and 
it simply zeroes out one of those bytes.  So, booting from a floppy won't
recognize a hard disk in this fashion (invalid drive spec ...) but when booting
off of the hard disk itself, PC-LOCK takes hold and recognizes itself, and
boots up fine with the CLEANDSK.DRV device driver.  (which is where the 
password stuff is.)  

The actual driver program itself and the installation programs are *VERY*
well protected.  The author must be commended with his attempts to hide
his code (self-decrypting).  

The simple way to by-pass this is to use FDISK to reclaim the whole disk
back again.  You would have to get to that point by some other means.
Experimentation is fun.  The person un-protecting the disk in this means
would have to know the partition boundaries in order to make it work, but
PC-LOCK does not (as far as I can determine) work with more than one
partition (such as a UNIX/MINIX partition).  Nor would it work with a friends'
AT&T 6300.  Not sure why.  Anyone else have any experiences with PC-LOCK?

Questions about the Novell Netware software:
1. What prevents the user from taking a snap-shot of memory and making
their own .EXE or .COM?

2. For that matter, what pervents them from using the DOS LOAD_PROGRAM
call, (without the execute-program version), to get a perfect image?
(This is how one program loads in overlays.  I do it all the time.)

3. I gather that the way EXECUTE ONLY works is that Novel has patched
DOS so that when it wants to read the blocks of an EXECUTE ONLY
program to load it into memory, it uses an undocumented BIOS READ DISK
BLOCK function.  Or would that be too simple?

The version of Empire for the Atari ST has a cute protection scheme that
looks relatively easy to implement.  In order to run the program, you
have to have a copy of the manual.  Why?  The program asks you to type
in "the Nth word on page M" where N and M are two randomly selected
numbers.  If you don't have the manual in front of you, you can't type
the word in and can't run the program!

It doesn't necessarily stop people from copying the program, but it DOES
make it more of a pain-in-the-you-know-what to do so.

   ... the .EXE files are
   flagged EXECUTE ONLY.  The only thing you can do to an execute only file is
   execute it and, if you're the system administrator, erase it.  All the extra
   files associated with the program are marked SHARABLE READ ONLY ( with a
   few annoying exceptions ).

Unless the programs wind up executing on the server (which doesn't
appear to be the case), there is no significant security difference
between labelling a file execute-only, and labelling it read-only; the
client has to be able to read the file across the network in order to
copy it into its address space to execute it.  If the students can
boot an arbitrary floppy on the PC's, or if they can patch the
operating system, they can get around this pseudo-security on the
client side.  This system may very well make it harder to steal the
software if you don't have source or symbol tables on the network code
and the protocols themselves are unpublished.  However, if you think
this is ``secure'', you're wrong.

Access control does no good on a network unless it is enforced on the
server end; the distinction between `read executable' and `read' is
enforced by the _client_, not the server.

	Does anyone have infomation about the capabilities and limitations
of police radars for speed checking.  I'm looking for both technical
limitations of the devices and for procedural limitations that are
necessary to make a ticket stand up in court.  I'm aware that many state
courts do not accept radar evidence and others (like california) only
allow it to be used in a few places.
	One technical limitation seems to be that the device must have
a stable speed reading before it displays a speed for the officer.  One
two occassions I've seen a car suddenly slow down, and avoid getting a ticket.
On another occassion I saw two cars zoom past a police car, neither was
stopped, but when a single car passed doing the same speed, it was pulled
over.  This seems to be a procedural limitation to avoid the defense of
a driver claiming that the other car was speeding.

Subj:	[2498] locksmithing courses

I researched this several years ago and found that most of the commercially
available courses aren't worth your time and money unless you actually wish
to go into business as a locksmith.  Since most 'serious' students are being
funded by the VA or some other government program, the courses are geared to
absorb the exact number of dollars provided by these agencies and include a
large amount of information necessary for someone operating a business, but
of no interest to anyone else -- things like how to install locks or fix door
closer mechanisms.  Most of these programs are also aimed at students with 
very limited educations, and you will probably find them pretty boring.

The only way to learn about locks is to work with them.  Instead of spending
your money on a course, go out and buy a sample of each major type.  Take
them apart, put them back together, and play with them until you understand
and appreciate the subtleties of their designs.  You may wind up destroying
a few, but in doing so you will learn a lot.

There are a few good books on the subject.  One is published by TAB books,
(they also print a lot of basic electronics and computer introductory texts).
Some of the others, including some pretty sophistocated references which were
considered secret within the trade ten years ago, may now be bought from some 
of the companies which sell books on survival, weapons, Ninja-whatever, and 
other sleazy topics.  Many of these advertise in gun mags or (I am told) in 
some of the weekly tabloids seen at the supermarket.

The hardest part, by far, will be obtaining specialized tools such as picks
and raw materials like key blanks.  If you can find a local locksmith who is
willing to trust you, that's the best bet.  Otherwise, you may have to pay
scalper prices through the mail-order sleaze merchants mentioned above.  I
would start by asking the 'smith to sell you a Pippin file, which you will
need anyway.  This is a fairly innocuous instruent, and asking for one may
just get your foot in the door.

Finally, beware of legal problems.  In many places, possession of locksmithing
tools is grounds for arrest.  The burden will be on you to prove that you are
really a serious hobbyist!

Subj:	[14996] Export of "public domain" crypto software

[Moderator note: Thanx also to Chris Kent <kent@decwrl> for forwarding this
as well; one outgoing copy is plenty...   _H*]

I read John Gilmore's mail, forwarded to SECURITY a few months ago,
with great interest. I wondered, could our export control laws really
be as rational as he claims? So I forwarded the memo to our company
export lawyers for comment. I am not really surprised at the outcome:
we are not so lucky. John's arguments are incorrect, and export of
all crypto software is in fact strictly regulated. I attach the gory
details I got back from our lawyers.

There have been some other comments recently to the effect of "why
bother regulating crypto export when it slips out anyway with public
comain software". There are a couple of things to be said:

(1) Like it or not, it's the law. Large corporations like DEC operate
    at a high level of visibility, and must hew to the straight and
    narrow far more than garage shops and private individuals. If we
    screw up legally, you can guarantee the government will be on our
    case pronto. We still have painful memories of the 782 fiasco a
    couple of years ago. That and related events at the time cost the
    company $1.5M to get its export license back, when
    (a) the export controls in question were Dept. of Commerce, and
    (b) it was far less clear that we had actually violated any laws.

(2) Given our general climate of free trade and communication, it is
    inevitable that some crypto software will slip past the export
    controls. The government does not have the resources to go after
    each individual violation. However, you can rest assured that
    repeated violators will be (and have been) brought on the carpet.
    Keep in mind that the "public" networks are to a large extent
    funded with government money. If a pattern of export violations
    develops on these networks, their very existence could be jeopardized.

SUBJECT: Controls Over The Export Of Cryptographic Software

This memo answers points made in an October 27, 1987, memo by John
Gilmore, which we received on January 28th.  Gilmore's memo, which I am
separately forwarding, argues that the posting of cryptographic software
to certain widely available bulletin boards places that software in the
"public domain," with the consequence that export licenses are not
required for the exports of that software.  Gilmore's analysis has been
given wide distribution on various networks. 

Gilmore is mistaken in his analysis and in his conclusion.  Given the
high national security sensitivity of cryptography, generally, and DES
encryption, specifically, it is important to set the record straight.

The fundamental points that Gilmore gets wrong are:

  o  Exports of cryptographic software are governed by the State
     Department's International Traffic in Arms Regulations ("ITAR"),
     not by the Commerce Department's Export Administration
     Regulations ("EAR").  Exports would be governed by Commerce's
     EAR only if State waived jurisdiction.

  o  Although State Department regulations contain a "public domain"
     exemption for technical data, cryptographic software does
     not qualify as "technical data," and thus the "public domain" 
     exemption does not apply.

A legal analysis follows.

                              DISCUSSION

I.  State Department Control Over Cryptographic Software
    ----------------------------------------------------
  
    A.  Cryptographic software is a "defense article" 
        ---------------------------------------------

Section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act authorizes the President to
control the export and import of "defense articles" and "defense
services."  This statutory authority -- which includes the authority to 
to "designate those items which shall be considered as defense articles 
and defense services" -- was delegated to the Department of
State, which in turn has implemented the statutory authority through
promulgation of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations ("ITAR"),
22 C.F.R. Subch. M.  

The term "defense article" is defined in section 120.7 of ITAR to mean 
"any item designated in section 121.1," which contains the United States 
Munitions List.  

Category XIII of the Munitions List provides in paragraph (b) as 
follows:

    Speech scramblers, privacy devices, CRYPTOGRAPHIC DEVICES AND 
    SOFTWARE (ENCODING AND DECODING), and components specifically
    designed or modified therefore, ancillary equipment, and protective
    apparatus specifically designed or modified for such devices, 
    components, and equipment.  (Emphasis added.)

Since "cryptographic . . . software" is thus included on the United 
States Munitions List, it is a "defense article" subject to the State 
Department's ITAR controls over exports of such articles.

At certain low thresholds, it may not be clear whether software
containing certain encryption functionality in a technical sense
constitutes "cryptographic software" within the meaning of Category
XIII(b), above.  Section 120.5 of ITAR establishes a procedure under
which "[t]he Office of Munitions Control will provide, upon written
request, a determination on whether a particular article is included on
the United States Munitions List."  Questionable cases may be resolved 
by following this procedure.

Assuming that encryption software does constitute "cryptographic 
software" within the meaning of Category XIII(b), State Department 
export licenses are required, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE ENCRYPTION IS 
BASED ON THE DES ALGORITHM.  The relevance of DES vs. non-DES lies in 
the ease with which licenses can be obtained, not in whether licenses
are required. 

    B.  The State Department's "public domain" exemption does not
        apply to exports of "defense articles."
        ---------------------------------------------------------

Part 123 of ITAR contains rules governing export licenses for the export 
of "defense articles."  The basic rule is stated in Section 123.1(a) as
follows:

    Any person who intends to export a defense article must obtain a
    license from the Office of Munitions Control prior to the export 
    unless the export qualifies for an exemption under the provisions 
    of this Subchapter.

Part 123 sets forth a number of exemptions in sections 123.16 through
123.22.  None is these exemptions covers the posting of cryptographic
software on a bulletin board. 

Section 126.5 exempts from the licensing requirement any exports of
unclassified defense articles or unclassified technical data to Canada
for end-use in Canada or return to the United States.  This exemption 
would be potentially applicable only if the ONLY exports that might take 
place as a result of the bulletin board posting were exports to Canada.  
(See section 120.10, which defines "export" to include "[s]ending or
taking defense articles outside the United States in any manner.")  In
any event, care would have to be taken to ensure that applicable
documentation requirements are met to invoke properly the exemption. 

Part 125 of ITAR contains rules governing exports of technical data.  
Section 125.1(a) provides:

    The export controls of this part apply to the export of technical
    data . . . . Information which is in the "public domain" (see 
    section 120.18) is not subject to the controls of this chapter.

Section 120.18 defines "public domain" as follows:

      "Public domain" means information which is published AND WHICH 
    IS GENERALLY ACCESSIBLE TO THE PUBLIC:
      (a) Through sales at newstands and bookstores;
      (b) Through subscriptions which are available without restriction
    to any individual who desires to obtain or purchase the published
    information; 
      (c) Through second class mailing privileges granted by the U.S.
    Government; or,
      (d) At libraries open to the public.

(Emphasis added.)  This definition is a much more restrictive one than 
the analogous Commerce GTDA regulation analyzed by Gilmore:  a bulletin 
board posting of information would not fall within ITAR's public domain 
unless that posting qualified under paragraphs (a)-(d) of section 
120.18.  A posting would not appear to so qualify.  (This memo does not
take any position on whether bulletin board posting would place
Commerce-controlled technical data into Commerce's public domain;
specific information about the technical data and the bulletin board
would be necessary.) 

Regardless of how the ITAR "public domain" applies to bulletin board
postings in general, the posting of cryptographic software cannot fall
within the "public domain" provision, because, per section 125.1(a) 
above, the "public domain" provision applies to "technical data."
Cryptographic software -- a "defense article" (see Section I.A above) --
does not constitute "technical data" under ITAR.  More on that below.

The term "technical data" is defined in section 120.21 as follows:

      "Technical data" means for purposes of this subchapter:
      (a) Classified information relating to defense articles and
    defense services;
      (b) Information covered by an invention secrecy order;
      (c) Information which is directly related to the design,
    engineering, development, production, processing, manufacture,
    use, operation, overhaul, repair, maintenance, modification, or
    reconstruction of defense articles.  This includes, for example,
    information in the form of blueprints, drawings, photographs,
    plans, instructions, computer software and documentation.  This
    also includes information which advances that state of the art of
    articles on the U.S. Munitions List.  This does not include 
    information concerning general scientific, mathematical or 
    engineering principles.

"Technical data" per this definition thus consists either of 
information "relating to defense articles" (par. (a)) or information 
directly related to the doing of things to "defense articles" (par. (c)).
[Paragraph (c) is not relevant here.]  Since cryptographic software is
itself a "defense article," it cannot simultaneously qualify as
"technical data."  Moreover, different ITAR Parts govern exports of
"defense articles" (Part 123) and exports of "technical data" (Part
125). 

Of course, not all encryption materials (DES or otherwise) necessarily
take the form of "cryptographic software" controlled under Category
XIII(b) of the Munitions List.  Non-Category XIII(b) materials will
qualify as "technical data" within the meaning of the section 120.21 and
will thus be eligible for "public domain" treatment if the specific ITAR
conditions apply. 

II.  Commerce Department Controls Over Cryptographic Software
     -------------------------------------------------------- 

Section 370.10 of Commerce's Export Administration Regulations state the
general rule that Commerce does not control exports of State
Department-controlled items.  Specifically, subsection (a) provides: 

    (a) U.S. Munitions List.  Regulations administered by the Office of
    Munitions Control, U.S. Department of State, Washington, D.C. 20520,
    govern the export of defense articles and defense services on the U.S.
    Munitions List. 

Thus, Gilmore's statement that the State Department's concerns about 
exports of crypt commands are "enforced" by Commerce is wrong.

What has complicated the picture and confused Gilmore is that Commerce's
Commodity Control List -- Commerce's counterpart to the United States
Munitions List -- contains a category 1527A covering "cryptographic
equipment . . . and software controlling or performing the function of
such cryptographic equipment."   Gilmore identified this regulatory control 
provision, but he misinterpreted it.  

Gilmore found the note in category 1527A, which states that 

    Exporters requesting a validated license from the Department of 
    Commerce must provide a statement from the Department of State,
    Office of Munitions Control, verifying that the equipment 
    intended for export is under the licensing jurisdiction of the
    Department of Commerce.

Gilmore mistakingly says, however, that "we are not requesting a
validated license, we are using the general license, so this requirement
does not apply . . . ."  Gilmore missed the 1527A heading: "Validated
License Required:  Country Groups QSTVWYZ."  These designated country 
groups comprise every country in the world except Canada.  Consequently, 
a validated license issued by Commerce is required in order to make any 
export of 1527A-controlled cryptographic software.  And because a
validated license is required, exporters seeking such a license must,
per the note quoted above, submit a State Department statement
"verifying" that Commerce has jurisidiction over that cryptographic
software.  Such a statement would generally take the form of an ITAR
section 120.5 commodity jurisdication determination. 

In sum, unless the State Department has issued a statement verifying
Commerce jurisdiction over the cryptographic software that Gilmore has
in mind, Commerce's controls do not apply.  And without such a
statement, Gilmore's analysis of section 379.3 of EAR (General License
GTDA) is completely irrelevant. 

III.  Conclusions
      -----------

Gilmore's conclusion that the posting of cryptographic software to a 
bulletin board places it in the public domain and thus exempts it from 
export licensing controls is flat-out wrong.  U.S. law is clear:  in 
order to export "cryptographic software" within the meaning of 
Category XIII(b) of the United States Munitions List to any country 
other than Canada, a State Department export license is required.
If there is any reason to believe or suspect that a non-U.S. or 
non-Canadian national will gain access to that bulletin board, an export 
to a third country should be assumed and a license is required..

If there is any question whether specific encryption software 
constitutes "cryptographic software" within the meaning of 
Category XIII(b), clarification can be obtained under procedures 
established pursuant to section 120.5 of ITAR.

A determination from State under 120.5 that it does not have 
jurisdiction is the prerequisite to bringing the control question into 
Commerce's export regulations.  

IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT NO DIGITAL EMPLOYEE ACT IN RELIANCE ON GILMORE'S
ANALYSIS OR HIS CONCLUSIONS.

I think Belsaw's course would fit your needs fairly well.  I took
this course in my spare time many years ago; it covered the basics
adequately, and you would mail in the results of exercises (such

Subj:	[791] Re: copy protection for micro software

Marauder (sp?) for the Amiga also uses the copy-protection scheme that
asks for certain words from the manual. Sinc the program is designed to
copy copy-protected disks, the normal mechanisms would not protect it.
In addition, the manual is printed in light blue, I assume non-repro blue.
Shortly after the program came out, a program named "find" came out that you
start before you run Marauder. When Marauder asks for word 6 on page 3, 
simply type "find 6 3" and find will tell you the word. Find does not
violate the copyright on the manual because it looks into Marauder's 
addres space to get the word; I know because there is at least one
word that Marauder "knows" incorrectly, but find will find tell you
what the program expects.

Subj:	[3572] Aerospace Computer Security Applications Conf. - Call for Papers

		Call for Papers
Fourth Aerospace Computer Security Applications Conference
December 12-16, 1988, Sheraton World Hotel, Orlando, Florida

		The Conference

Operational requirements for civil and military 
systems under development increasingly stress  the necessity for information 
to be readily accessible to users and operators.  This produces an 
apparent conflict with policies and directives which require total 
protection of system data from compromises of privacy, confidentiality, 
and integrity.  Accomplishing both of these sets of requirements requires 
the application of the maturing technology of computer security to 
new systems throughout their development cycle.  In addition, operational 
approaches to satisfy system requirements and accommodate the implementation 
of engineering technology require intensified research and development.

This conference will explore technology applications
in two complementary aspects:  first, the policy issues and 
operational requirements for both civil and military systems; and 
second, the hardware and software tools and techniques being developed 
to satisfy system requirements.  Special emphasis will be placed on 
specific examples of systems applications.

A three-day technical conference exploring the  
application of computer security technology will be preceded by two 
days of tutorials dealing with policy matters, technology applications, 
and  other areas.  Introductory and advanced surveys will be offered 
as well as advanced courses exploring specialized technological areas.

		Areas of Interest Include:
 
	* Trusted DBMSs and Operating Systems
	* Network Security
	* Current and Future Trusted System 
	* Technology
	* Space Station Requirements
	* Certification, Evaluation and 
	* Accredition
	* Policy and Management Issues
	* Advanced Architectures
	* C3I Systems
	* Risk/Threat Assessments
	 
		Papers and Tutorials

Technical papers and tutorials which address  
the application of computer security technologies in the aerospace 
environment are solicited.  Original research, analyses and approaches 
for defining the computer security issues and problems identified 
in the Conference's interest areas; methodological approaches for 
analyzing the scope and nature of computer security issues; and, potential 
solutions are of particular interest.  Full unclassified papers or

[Moderator note: I pulled this off sci.crypt; some of you may not
have seen it yet.   _H*]

I'm glad to see that a lawyer has finally looked over the analysis of
PD cryptographic software export controls that I did a while ago.  I
still think we have a free country but will go look up the regulations
they quote, to make sure.  It may be that before we post something, we
have to put it in a magazine or newsletter, or offer it on floppies to
anyone who sends in $5 -- no big deal.  I would prefer to have a court
rule that posting something to 8000 machines, many of which are
public-access, and including it in a software library accessible to
anyone, is making it "freely available to the public".  But for that to
happen, somebody will have to take somebody to court, and so far there
are no volunteers.

The point is that information which is freely available to anyone in
the US can be exported.  If any Tom, Dick, or Harry in the states can
get it, there should be no grounds to hassle somebody over exporting it.

Realize that the lawyer who came up with this opinion is paid by DEC to
keep DEC out of trouble.  The safest thing to do, in the short term,
is to turn and run from any kind of trouble.  I just think that the long
term trouble caused by only the government having privacy is worth
facing the short term trouble.

I'll have more to say later.

Subj:	[1193] Question--Exporting the DES Algorithm

What exactly is the policy regarding exportation of software object
code implementing (in one form or another) the National Bureau of
Standards Federal Information Processing Data Encryption Standard
(DES) algorithm?

The AT&T UNIX Operating System Release 2.2 and Release 3 license
agreements state that the "crypt" program, library, and associated
documentation are not to be distributed with international versions of
the operating system.  Careful examination of the source code,
however, reveals the following:

1)   The "crypt" library is not the sole source for the crypt(3)
     routine.  The generic C library includes the same crypt routine
     as contained in the "crypt" library.  The difference is that in
     the "crypt" library, there are additional decryption routines.

2)   There appears to be nothing special about the "crypt" program.
     It does not differ in its use of the DES algorithm from "login".

My question is: exactly what may not be exported (by law, not
tradition), and why is exportation proscribed?

Please respond via E-Mail.  Thank you for your help.

Not very convienent if your PC is in a cabinet.  Also if you're running in

they don't allow passthru or will wind up with your machine in the middle

Although I've never looked for it in print, I've heard that some states 
require a radar gun to be calibrated periodically (like hourly).  If
you challenge a radar ticket in court by asserting that the gun was out 
of calibration, the prosecutor should have to produce evidence that the 
gun had been appropriately calibrated.  If the ticketing officer didn't
bring his calibration records with him to court that day, you'd probably

Cc: SECURITY@aim.rutgers.edu

Andy--
  Many thanks for providing that legal analysis regarding export of
cryptographic software.  It was all most interesting and informative.
There's one point at the end which could use some further
clarification, however:

	If there is any reason to believe or suspect that a non-U.S. or
	non-Canadian national will gain access to that bulletin board, an
	export to a third country should be assumed and a license is
	required..

Let's say that a given bulletin board could somehow be confined within
the U.S. borders.  It is still the case that a LOT of non-U.S. or
non-Canadian nationals will have access to it, be they permanent
residents, foreign students, etc.  Is it really true that export to a
third country must be assumed in this case?  I'm guessing that Digital
itself has a lot of employees in this category.  Surely they are not
barred from looking at cryptographic software, or are they?  Even if
they sign confidentiality agreements with Digital, I would be
surprised if the State department would consider this sufficient for
export control purposes in general.  I guess what we need here is a
clear definition of what "export" means for the purpose of these
statutes.

Subj:	[938] Re:  police radar

The police radar's that I've played with have had an audio feedback.
With the audio feed back, you hear an obnoxious buzzing and whistling
which represents the doppler shift comming back from the object you
are clocking.  I found that by listening and watching, I could very
accuratly determine exactly who I was aiming at, even with 2 or more 
cars comming at me.

I would point the gun at an aproacing car and I'd hear a high pitched
whine, point it away and the whine would go away.  Point it at two cars
and I'd hear 2 whines at different pitches.  Moving the gun twards one
car made one whine louder and the other softer.

Of course, I've very rarly seen police officers actually holding the
radar guns.  Most of them I've seen were aimed forward or backwards
attached to the window in the left rear.  I can't imagine that it would
be too easy to figure out who exactly you were aiming at with the gun
in this position.

The procedures vary widely from state to state as well as from the local
municipality and counties. The research you need to do starts on the local
level and will be interesting. I have found that the following can be true:
1. Local police departments may require periodic testing of the units by
an in/outside tech type that will validate the Radar unit for safety (rads)
as well as the degree of accuracy for the unit.
	1a. This may be out of date as well as never done.
	1b. State requirements may be downgraded and be illegal.
	1c. There may be no requirements (state or local).
	1d. The testing (when performed inside) may be done by
	    someone that does not have the qualifications nor the
	    capabilities.
2. Find out if the locality is a constantly watched spot. A police
eye (ie: trained observer) that is on the scene and is familiar with
the traffic patterns as well as the time involved for a car to pass point
A and get to B is as good (in some cases) as the Radar gun. This is also
subject to state and local laws.

3. Final note..... READ THE TICKET!   In general, a typo or misprint
anywhere on the ticket is the real loophole. You can be away clean.

Luck...

Subj:	[1612] Re: copy protection for micro software

Shipping a piece of hardware that must be plugged into the computer before the 
software will run has been tried, with only moderate success.

There are a couple ways to circumvent this scheme, both fairly 
straightforward: copy the piece of hardware or remove or rewrite the piece of 
code in the program that checks to see if the hardware is where it should be.

I've only seen this implemented for very small computers; Atari 8 bit machines 
and commodore 64 computers.  Basically, a small jumpered plug was inserted 
into the joystick port.  The program then matched out signals through the 
joystick port to see if the plug was there.

Finding the code in the programs wasn't a complex job; one could pull up a 
machine language debugger and monitor the joystick port for accesses.  From 
there, the code could be broken down and the part that controlled access 
replaced with an "ok" code.  One would no longer need a piece of hardware to 
run the program.

Also, these plugs were fairly simple to copy.  All one had to do was to crack 
open the device (I think they called them "dongles," a name I hate for some 
reason), look at the way the inside worked (usually simple, a jumper or two) 
and then make a new one out of a $.75 joystick plug and a few pieces of wire.  
A company would generally have a single "dongle" to run all their programs; 
pirates had only to make one "dongle" to run a whole family of programs.

I haven't seen it implemented for the PC's or anything above, but I would 
think that the same measures could be taken to circumvent copy protection.

In the 4-Mar-88 edition of Security Digest, hp-sdd!dag@hp-lsd.hp.com suggests
that "operation of the software to a piece of hardware." Some vendors of
equipment for use on Ethernets (or IEEE 802.3 networks) do just as he suggests.
The software checks the 48-bit source address of the host it is running on. If
the address is different than expected, the software fails to work.

This scheme has failed (i.e., not permitted legal software to function
correctly) when the equipment had a second Ethernet port installed. In this
case, the equipment had two 48-bit source addresses, and the software checked
the "wrong" one.

Can anyone provide any information concerning the use of the AMD DES

I understand that the CPU boards have any empty socket which will
accomodate the AMD chip (AmZ8068) and that the kernel has to be
reconfigured to make use of the chip.  Is that all there is to it?
Will this permit the 'des' command to use the AMD chip, rather than
use software?  I have also heard that two additional chips may or may
not be necessary -- one is a TTL support chip, the other a PAL.  What
exactly are these chips for?  Are they necessary, or not?

Is anyone out there, in particular anyone at SUN, currently

I *totally* agree.  If more people believed this, we wouldn't have the problems
we have now with exporting crypt, ...

It seems to me it's a philosophical battle between those who say "we won't tell
you anything about it to make it more secure" and those who say "if we can't
study it, we can't tell if it is secure (and it probably isn't)".  With the
advent of decent public key encryption, one-way encryption of passwords etc it
seems to me a *good thing* that security systems become more understood so that
the state of the art continues to advance.

Subj:	[2549] Re:  SSNs, the SSA, and giving out info

Back on 25 Feb., I posted a note about a local (St. Louis) newspaper
advice column which stated baldly that the SSA would give people info
about an individual if you gave them their SSN. Here are the relevant
paragraphs from that original posting:

>If they cannot answer your questions directly, they may be willing to
>give you her Social Security number. You can then trace her whereabouts
>through the Social Security Administration.
>
>At 63, she may have retired, and if she is receiving Social Security
>payments, you might be able to get her current address. If she is
>deceased, the SSA should be able to tell you that, also.

I promised that, when I had time, I would check with the SSA office here
and let the list know what they said about this -- was it true or not?
Well, I finally had a chance to check today. The word from them is that
the SSA will NOT give an inquirer info about a person just because that
inquirer provides the subject's SSN. What they will do, though, is to take
information from the inquirer, and then write the subject of the inquiry a
letter, saying something like, "John Smith, who claims to be your cousin, is
trying to get in touch with you. His name, address, and phone are: xxxxxx.
You may contact him there if you wish to."

In other words, they will act as a conduit to the party whose SSN is
provided, but will not give out information about that person to another.
(I didn't think to go into detail about just what the SSA would do if
the person was listed as deceased, unfortunately.)

This actually strikes me as being very helpful, and more likely to be
something that the SSA would do theoretically than that they are likely
to do in real life! I was asking this as an hypothetical question,
showing the SSA representative the newspaper column, and wasn't actually
asking them to DO anything. I wouldn't be surprised if this was
something so out-of-the-ordinary, so unlike standard procedure, that it
would be next to impossible to get the SSA to do this in reality. After
all, to do the search and write the letter would take some hours of
time, and, considering SSA employees are rated on how many cases they
can process in a day, it would be a rare find indeed to locate one who
would be willing to delay normal processing, buck the system, and do an
inquiring stranger this favor!

Nonetheless, from a privacy issue standpoint, the info I got was
reassuring. At least the SSA claims it will not wantonly distribute data
about you to anyone who happens to know your SSN.

Subj:	[5022] Re: Question--Exporting the DES Algorithm

     The  communications on  exporting the  DES  algorithm which  have
appeared on the net recently are ALL correct.   Huh? What did you just
say?  Read on.

     If something not  subject to  ITAR  regulations is in the  public
domain, or "widely  published"  in the US,  any  citizen has a general
license to export that information.  If fact you  may go  overseas and
speak publicly about what  you know, and  that will create information
subject to license  requirements,  qualify it for general license, and
export it.  In other  words, as  an American citizen,  your freedom of
speech does not end at the waters' edge.  (The  country where you give
the  speech might not  like what  you   say, but  that  is a different
issue.)

     However, if you have information subject  to ITAR regulations (no
matter how you got it), you (or your company) can be prosecuted if you
export it  without  State   Department  approval.   See the  "aid  and
comfort" clause in the constitution. Since  some crypto information is
clearly  protected this way, most  company lawyers "take  the easy way
out" and advise the company not to export any crypto software, without
checking to see if it falls under the ITAR rules.

    (Apply standard disclaimers to what follows at least  twice.) Last
time I checked the "opinion" of State was that  the  DES algorithm was
not subject to ITAR rules,  although  certain implementations (usually
in the  form  of chips)  were  protected.   Note  that  any government
employee must be vague here, either he knows all the (classified) uses
of crypto (and where is YOUR need  to know) but  can't tell you, or he
doesn't know and  can't be    more specific.   Therefore the  standard
procedure is  to    request   an  opinion  before    exporting  crypto
implementations, and if you don't get something on  the order of "your
application does not currently appear to fall under ITAR rules..." you
talked to the wrong person (or  you really are trying to  export a 300
MIP DES chip 8^> ).

     If you do ACCIDENTLY export  something subject to ITAR rules, you
probably won't  go to jail.    In  any violation,  your rights to free
speech must be shown to conflict with other constitutional powers, and
the balence must tilt strongly against you before the ITAR regulations
have any  standing.  If you   intentionally violate  the   ITAR  regs,
however you might not have any constitutional protection.

     Let me give   you a realistic  example.  You   buy a Zowie   1000
portable computer  and  take it  with  you to England.  Unbeknownst to
you, the Zowie 1000 is  used in a  test system for Stealth  Bomber ECM
equiptment.  You  violated the   ITAR regulations, but   in the normal
course of events, you won't even know it, because the DoD  is unlikely
to  tell  the Customs  people which  COTS   (commercial off the shelf)
equipment is used on black projects.  In any case  your  violation was
innocent and is probably protected.

     Second case,  an ATE specialist  on  the Stealth project  buys  a
Zowie 1000 for personal use  because he uses it at  work and likes it.
He takes  it  (and some  of his software)  to England on his vacation.
Dumb, and the  security folk at  the plant may  have a  long talk with
him, but if it was innocent probably  no long term repercussions.  The
third  case of course,  is  he  takes it with him  and  sells it  to a
foriegn  agent for $100,000 -- and  twenty years hard labor.  What did
you think the ITAR regulations were for anyway?

     So now you  know  why  all the  weasel words.    If you   take my
(knowingly incoorect) advice (or someone elses) and innocently violate
the ITAR  regs, I'm guilty and  you  are not...   "So  you're going to
Berlin on  your  vacation?  Could you  do   me a favor?   I  have this
package for  my sister,  but the mail takes weeks.   I'll give you ten
bucks for your trouble."  You are only guilty if you think  he's a spy
and do it anyway...  Each case is  different, and an awful lot depends
on intent.

     It would be nice if someone who has  requested and recieved (from
the government, not from a company lawyer) a recent opinion on the DES
algorithm, would post the opinion here.  If no one out in net land has
a recent opinion,  someone should go  ahead and request one.  The most
recent opinion  I have seen was  two companies back,  and   things can
change in either direction.

					Robert I. Eachus

Disclaimer: Oh boy, do I need one here.  If you  have any intention of
exporting  anything which might  be subject to  ITAR  rules, have your
lawyer check with the State Department and get a written opinion.   If
you decide to create a test case and  take  it  to  the Supreme Court,
I'll be glad to come cheer, but if you expect me to get up  and say it
was all my idea, you didn't read carefully.

Second  Disclaimer: I  didn't ask MITRE,   MITRE's lawyers, or  anyone
elses lawyers  for their opinion of  this message, but if  I  did, I'm
sure that they would waffle at least as well as I did.

Subject:      Hacker hits VMS

From The Star-Ledger(Newark NJ) 3/17/88

        TEEN HACKER 'INVADES' NEW SECURE COMPUTER

    PARIS(Reuters)- A 19-year-old West German hacker has succeeded
    in breaking into one of the world's top-selling computers,
    Digital Equipment Corp.'s VAX system, in what experts say is a
    new blow to confidence in computer security.
        Computer specialists broke the news yesterday at a computer
    conference already shocked by the arrest on Sunday of West
    German hacker Steffen Wernery, 26, as he arrived to take part
    in a panel debate on system security.
        Wernery is a member of the Hamburg-based Chaos Computer
    Club which caused a storm last year when it revealed it had
    penetrated more than 100 computers around the world, including
    the network of the U.S. space agency NASA.
        French police announced later that Wernery had been charged
    with "theft, destruction and damaging computer goods" and had
    been jailed pending trial.
        West German journalist and computer expert Hans Gliss, who
     was also held briefly by French police when he arrived in Paris
    on Sunday, said the unidentified 19-year-old from Munich had
    worked out how to enter VAX computers made by Digital.
        Gliss said the Munich hacker had breached the VAX system by
    using material openly available from Digital, which is based in
    Maynard, Mass.
        Digital executives were in a meeting and not available for
    comment, a spokeswoman said.
        Rudiger Dierstein, of West Germany's national space foundation
    DFVLR, said the consequences of the Munich hacker's achievement
    were "terrifying."
        "This person has given a full description of how to gain access
    to the system and gain full control. Imagine combining the
    intelligence of this hacker with a definite criminal intention,"
    he said.
        "Someone could take control of a satellite as they are all
    computer-controlled. That is why I tremble when I hear the initials
    SDI."
        SDI stands for President Reagan's proposed Strategic Defense
    Initiative, a space-based computer-guided defense system against
    nuclear missile attack.
        Dierstein said the 19-year-old had privately published his work
    in a pamphlet entitled "Hints on the Use of the VMS Operating System"
    but police had confiscated all the documents.
        The VMS(Virtual Memory System) is the main language used in
    Digital's VAX computers.
        Experts said other major computer manufacturers like IBM could
    not afford to be complacent as it was being shown their systems
    were equally vulnerable.
        Companies targeted by Chaos Computer Club "hackers" were unaware
    their systems had been tampered with until the club informed West
    German authorities.
        Experts at the Paris conference said Wernery had fixed a meeting
    with the French subsidiary of the Phillips electronic group - one
    of the companies penetrated by the hackers - before leaving for France.

Subject:      Re: Hacker hits VMS

Does anyone know if this is a REAL security hole in VMS or just the
usual
1) failure to change default password(s) on sys, maint, user, userp
   accounts as shipped from DEC.
or
2) autologins left activated by local sys manager.
or
3) other equivalent act of stupidity.

Often these sensational stories are due to vulnerability caused by
stupidity.  I have never had much trouble in "hacking" a login to a
multiuser system when testing for security, usually by just trying
the time-honored guess-the-password approach.  Of course, hacking to
TEST for security on your own computers is quite different from the
vandalism and criminalism of attacking someone else's machines, whether
one is hacking through cleverness or taking advantage of the lax
management of computer systems on all os's that is out there.  I know of
large numbers of machines that are accessible to the world where the
local users object strongly to being forced to periodically change
passwords or insist on using any password, including very short
passwords, last names, etc.  The ability to "hack" a login is inversely
proportional to the number of login accounts on the system :-)

Of course, all os's exhibit true security hole bugs from time to time.
Is this one?

Subj:	[1196] dongle

Years ago, when I was an avid C-64 user, my favorite word processor was
PaperClip from Batteries Included (in Toronto, I think).  They allowed
(encouraged) copying their software for backup purposes; to use the program,
you had to have an electronic key, called a `dongle', plugged into one of the
joystick ports.  I have seen that word used in other documentation to mean the
same thing.

Of course, versions of PaperClip which didn't need a dongle to operate
proliferated as crackers everywhere found the code which checked for the
dongle and detoured around it.  I didn't care; PaperClip was so good, and the
manual was so well written, that, like Turbo Pascal, it was worth it to me to
have a legitimate version and the support that went with it.  Batteries
Included used the same system with other software they published, like
Delphi's Oracle.

Great word, huh?  I'm suprised that it didn't find its way into a book of
Sniglets.  I'd like to see an etymology.

>[Moderator note:  *What* is a "dongle"??   _H*]

Every so often I feel like I've just passed through a time-warp.
Unfortunately, it's always backwards.  ADAPSO supported this idea which
died a timely death about a year or so ago.  A "dongle" refers to the
little device which plugged into the back of the PC into the RS-232
port.  A fair amount of research apparently went into these and some
software actually shipped with this protection scheme.  ADAPSO pulled its
support of any kind of standard for use.  Copy protection seems to be
a non-issue.  With the crash of the PC software industry, copy
protection is just what a small company needs to go under.  If your
software is still copy-protected, rest assured your software is not
available in my shop.

Maybe the latest incident on computer embezzlement? Two employees of the
largest Norwegian clearing house, Bankenes Betalingsentral BBS, are charged
with attempted fraud.

The scheme was apparently in accordance to the old dream of redirecting
transactions to other accounts. The particular day of the attempt, there were
to be a large number of social security benefit transfers. The possible
outcome is said to be app. ! 250 million. One of the two had an operator
type job, with access to tapes. However, the whole thing was set up in
such a way that it was easilly detected by regular security checks.

This hopefully shows that security does work, and that the notion that
no cases have ever been spotted due to security routines, is not true.

Subj:	[1042] Re: copy protection for micro software

      Technically dongles can be made to work, and a number of vendors
sell them.  See any issue of PC Tech Journal for ads for such gadgets.
But they are very unpopular with users, and you get nasty reviews in Byte
if you put one on your product.

      The most successful dongles do something useful that the program
needs to function.  Some dongles have a CPU in them, typically an 8-bit
microcontroller.  If some obscure but crucial part of the processing is
performed in the dongle itself, it can be very difficult to operate the
program without it.  

      An excellent example is Cubicomp, which sells an animation package
that requires a special graphics board only available through Cubicomp.
There's actually nothing exciting about their graphics board; it's just
a marketing ploy, and one clever enough that few people have figured it
out yet.

      These strategies are generally for high-end software.  At the low
end, games, the future probably lies with compact disk technology.
But that's another story.

Subj:	[1822] Submission for misc-security

One problem with using passwords is their vulnerability to an eavesdropping
attack.  One solution is to implement a challenge and response algorithm as
described here.

1.  Let P(day) represent a secret permutation of the alphabet, unique every
    day.  e.g. P(today) = zfhkgjavitclbumxpwdonyrseq

2.  Let C(T,N) be a function which generates a string of N unique letters.
    T is the time of day (number of seconds since midnight).
    e.g. C(12:00:00,5) = jrmxo

3.  Let M(P(day),C(T,N)) be a mapping function such that every letter in
    C(T,N) is replaced by the letter following it in P(day). This mapping
    is simple and can be applied by visual inspection.
    e.g. C(zfhkgjavitclbumxpwdonyrseq,jrmxo) = asxpn

The permutation of the alphabet of the day P(today) is printed, then, when
the user is logging in, a challenge is issued using the C(T,N) function and
the user's response is compared with the result of M(P(day),C(T,N)).  If
they match, the user is allowed access.

How does one evaluate the security of this system?  What are the possible
attacks assuming 100% collection of the wiretap data?  How does one choose
a suitable value for N?  If N = 1, the attacker has a 1:26 chance getting in,
but if N = 26, the attacker can derive P(today) after one observation.

Does the C(T,N) function need to be secret or is it alright to allow the
attacker to anticipate the challenge?  I suggest using T as a parameter
to eliminate the problem of the same challenge being issued twice on the
same day (thus with the same P(day)).

What with all the viruses running about these days, I was wondering what
sort of protection ATM machines have against such beasties.  Specifically,
I'm concerned about my $$$ in these machines.  It has occurred to me that
the machines which accept charge cards (such as Visa and MC), could not really
verify that the PIN you key in is indeed your PIN.  It takes up to 5 minutes
for an authorization request to come back from a dept. store card reader
when you make a purchase, yet the ATM is instanteanous.....this is wierd,
either the PIN is stored on the card (read: very stupid) or the machine just
ignores the PIN of credit cards.....

Whats the deal? does anyone know about what actually goes on with these
machines?

In general, before trying to transport _any_ machine-readable media
across _any_ international boundaries, you should consult your friendly,

   No legal obligations at all unless there is something explicity
in the liscensing agreement.  Even if there is it would be hard to
prove that customer A had knowledge of the bug.

    Notify the vendor.  If you get no response send out the bug to
everybody you can.  Since you had previously notifed the vendor and
he did nothing, they could be held liable for any damages caused by
the bug.

Subj:	[4020] Cops Catch Clumsy Computer ``Criminal''

From the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, April 24.
Used without permission.

by Roger Stuart

SOUTH PARK MAN CAUGHT IN U.S. TRAP LEAVES TRAIL CLOUDED IN MYSTERY

A South Park man who was stung seeking bogus computer-stored
information about U.S. military secrets has a long history of
mysterious associations, ranging from foreign intrigue to local
garbage.

As with past incidents, authorities don't know -- or won't say --
what Laszlo J. Balogh was up to this time when his name surfaced in a
sting that caught a West German computer hacker who repeatedly gained
access to classified military files.

As with past exploits, Balogh, 43, emerged again as part-clever and
part-klutzy.

Although he has claimed extnsive foreign government contacts and
driven expensive foreign cars, he once testified that he had
difficulty recording an undercover conversation for the FBI because
the recorder kept slipping beneath his sweat suit.

In the past, Balogh has billed himself as a Hungarian refugee; a
draftsman; a credit corporation employee; a trucking company owner; a
diamond dealer; a world traveler; a bodyguard for Kuwaiti princesses;
a CIA hit man; and an FBI informant.

But longtime neighbors on Ventura Drive said they had no clear
picture of Balogh's activities because he is "quiet," "keeps to
himself" and is "often gone for weeks at a time."

...Balogh in 1978 was an officer in a now-defunct company when
another company official was accused of giving Penn Hills officials a
forged check drawn on a non-existent bank.  The check was to be used
as security in an unsuccessful effort to obtain a garbage-hauling
contract.  ... Balogh also was involved in a Pittsburgh trucking firm
that filed for bankruptcy in 1980.

His name surfaced again last week in connection with Marcus Hess,
identified by The San Francisco Examiner as the West German computer
student who broke access codes to snoop in to U.S. military files a
half-world away in Berkeley, Calif.

Earlier, a West German weekly magazine, Quick, identified the
computer intruder as Mathias Speer, 24.  Clifford Stoll, a researcher
at the Berkeley Laboratory and Leroy Kerth, a Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratory director who oversaw the investigation, said that name may
have been a pseudonym.

In this case, Balogh, in what investigators believe was an attempt to
get more information about confidential military files, took the bait
investigators dangled in the hopes of learning who was gaining
illegal access to the computer system.

Having discovered that an intruder had been reading their computer
records, officials at the U. S. Department of Energy's Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratiry planted a fictitious file to bait the hacker's
interest.

The purpose was to keep the hacker on the line long enough for
authorities to trace his phone call.  The hacker tapped into the
computer using a telephone and computer modem.  In the event that the
call coudln't be traced, authorities also included in the fictitious
file an address for the snooper to write for additional information.

Berkeley officials thought they had solved their security problem in
January 1987, when West German officials were able to trace the phone
call to a computer student in Hanover.

They were surprised four months later when they received a letter
from Balogh, who requested the information offered in the fictitious
file.

...Although caught, the West German student has not been charged with
any crime.  The extent of Balogh's involvement has not been revealed.

The FBI isn't saying what, if anything, it knows about Balogh, who in
1983 served them as an informant and government witness.

[More about Balogh's involvement in schemes to steal $38,000 in
diamonds, secure garbage-hauling contriacts with a phony check, and
steal computer equipment to sell to the Soviets.]

Subj:	[9085] Reporting Security Problems

ORG5NMC@CMS1.UCS.LEEDS.AC.UK asks...

(If you put your real name on the message, I'll feel like I'm
answering a person rather than a string of alphabet soup.)

>        I want to ask a question about computer security. Are there
> any legal obligations (British or American) on a computer user
> who finds a major flaw within a popular OS?

Legal: no. The laws surrounding computer security are in an incredibly
primitive state. In the US and some European countries, unauthorized
use of computers is now explicitly illegal; in the UK, recent
decisions I've heard about indicate that there is no law against
simple unauthorized entry. Enforcement is yet another story, ranging
from the French throwing Steffen Wernery in the nick on suspicion of
hacking, to the Germans having to catch someone at home with his
fingers in the cookie jar, with the US somewhere in between.

But I know of no law that requires an individual to report security
problems. If I attempt to draw a parallel to other industry, I don't
believe there are any laws requiring private individuals to report,
say, safety problems they become aware of. In general, concealment of
risks is only illegal where the party who hides information stands to
gain from having the information remain secret (e.g., by avoiding a
costly recall campaign or expensive safety improvements in a factory)
or has control over the risk.

But I do think people whe find a security problem have a moral
obligation to report it. People who find security problems are in
general professionals or researchers, and carry an obligation to the
advancement and improvement of the art. Reporting problems is part of
that obligation.

>						 How could a private
> individual bring a bug to the attention of a computer manufacturer

> finds these bugs?

I'm distressed to heard that site management personnel would be so
short-sighted to discipline someone who searches for security bugs.
If a security problem exists, someone will find it sooner or later;
I'd rather it were the curious but responsible hacker than someone
malicious.

Do please report the problem to the manufacturer. Easier said than
done, of course. Most major computer manufacturers have large
bureaucracies dedicated to "customer service", and wading through
this bureaucracy and its rules can be tedious. DEC is no exception.
Try starting with the nearest software service office. See if you
can get through to someone technical. I like to think that we've
done a pretty good job of instilling in our technical support people
the appropriate Pavlovian response to the phrase "security problem in
VMS". (If you haven't guessed, that response is "contact engineering,
fast!")

If you can't get through this way, like because you can't get past
the secretary because you don't know your service contract number
or don't have one, see if you can get through to someone responsible
at a regional office like Basingstoke. (Colorado Springs in the US.)
If this doesn't work, try the informal but direct route. The engineering
folks of most of the major manufacturers are reachable via the
internets. All you have to do is find out who they are. Look for
people who discuss security things in the newsgroups (like me here,
for example). I can't give you specific names for all time because
people change jobs, but recent mail ought to give you some leads.
Once you get electronic mail to an interested party in the company,
chances are pretty good the information will get to the right person
in a matter of days or even hours.

[You may wonder, why doesn't DEC just publish an internet address for
the express purpose of reporting security problems? It has to do with
who owns the nets and what they're supposed to be used for. By and
large, they are government funded, and are supposed to exist for
the benefit of the educational and research organizations. Having a
manufacturer make such a direct use of the public nets smacks too
much of gaining commercial benefit from a publicly funded facility.
Also, it gives rise to complaints of preferential treatment for
sites that happen to have internet access. Obviously, any information
volunteered to individuals via the internet will be put to appropriate
use by the manufacturer, but expressly setting up a service appears
unseemly.]

If you've still gotten nowhere, you may have to try a broadcast
approach. Send a message to an appropriate newsgroup (like INFO-VAX
for VMS) to the effect "I have found a security problem in xxx and
would like to report it to the responsible party. Would someone in
engineering please contact me?" I would guess that all the
manufacturers monitor the important newsgroups (DEC certainly does),
and you should get response fast. Of course, your site people may also
be reading the newsgroup, and if this is something you haven't told
them about and they have the attitude you described above, you may
regret having done this. You'll have to weigh the pro's and con's.

There is a logical next step one might consider, which is to publish
the problem itself. This I implore you not to do. Please don't even
tell your friends. Yes, you'll get lots of attention and action, but
you'll also cause both the manufacturer but mainly the entire user
base much pain. Think about it. You're the only person (in all
probability) who knows about this problem. If you're a responsible
guy, it'll be safe with you. But there are a lot of not very nice
people in the world, and a lot of copycats. If you publicize a
security problem, you give all these dirtballs a tool to go messing up
the lives of a lot of innocent computer users.

Even publicizing a security problem to "responsible people" carries a
risk. The more people know about the problem, the greater the chance
it will get out somehow. Even if the whole story doesn't get out, if
partial or distorted information gets out, others still will know
where to look. Consider the probabilities. The typical mean time to
discovery of a security problem in VMS is a couple of years. You just
found it. But the chance that anyone else working independently will
find it in the next 6 months is fairly small. Resist the temptation to
conclude that just because you found this problem, all systems in your
company or university are at risk and must be notified immediately. It
ain't so. The bug always looks horribly simple and obvious after
you've found it. But it's buried in a million or so lines of code, and
you got lucky. It's only a problem if you tell others.

There is a set of people who disagree with the above philosophy, and
will probably jump all over me when they see this message. (I've
gotten jumped all over each time previously.) I still stand by my
position. Others will claim that once one cracker knows about a problem
you might as well assume everyone knows about it. Further, they
claim that suitably informed system managers can take their own
defensive measures if they are informed about a problem. I don't
buy it, for several reasons:

(1) My experience tells me the cracker communications aren't that good.
    Yes, some of them will post the news on bulletin boards and it
    will spread some, but they're just not that globally organized.
    The Chaos Club is an exception to this rule, but they're not
    everyone.

(2) You can't tell the good guys from the bad guys. Make the information
    available, and you will guarantee that it will fall into more of
    the wrong hands.

(3) Some system managers will be sufficiently competent to solve the
    problem on their own. The majority are probably not. Sorry, it
    sounds like a damned elitist thing to say, but an operating system
    is a complicated gadget, and if you fix something wrong you're
    more than likely to break something else worse. What if someone
    publishes a patch for the problem? Would you trust a patch for
    your operating system coming from someone you never heard of? If
    you would, read some of the recent mail about viruses and think
    again.

(4) You won't reach nearly everyone. The internets reach only a small
    percentage of the customer base of any of the major manufacturers.
    So you do publish a trustworthy patch for all the internet users.
    The other 90% of the installations won't get your message, and now
    they're all the more vulnerable because all the bad guys who read
    the net news know what the problem is. Not even all the folks on
    the internets will get the message. I recently saw mail go by from
    some poor soul who had not heard about the V4.4 SECURESHR bug, and
    that one has been discussed extensively in INFO-VAX for months.

I've been in this debate for some years now, and everything I've seen
and heard tells me that if you find out about a security bug, you should

(1) tell the manufacturer as effectively and directly as you can
(2) otherwise shut up.

Well, that was a long answer to a short question. But it's one of my
favorite subjects. Thanks for listening.

Subj:	[1644] Virus-writing 101?

Thought I'd relate a recent incident to the group regarding computer virus
writing and propogation.  Apparently we have a professor who thought it would
be a good experience for his students, as a project, to write (each) a
virus, and demonstrate that it works.  OK, in my opinion we're already on
shaky ground assuming the 20 or so different viruses can remain totally
isolated within the student-instructor environment.  As you can guess,
some of them have "leaked" out of the "lab".  One report indicates that
the instructor's hard disk was erased, and another that one student's
final project was eaten by his own virus.  At least one unrelated PC was
found to be infected (in the University's Micro Resource Center!).  There
are arguments going backand forth about whether this was blatantly
irresponsible, or if viral education is a good thing.  One can't even
consider firing the instructor because he's already leaving to go to
another institution.  So, this might be a good topic to kick back and
forth for a while?  What are the ethics/legalities of such an incident?
For instance, in American law & philosophy, freedom of information is nearly
sacred; is propoagation of the knowlege on how to write a virus itself a
bad thing, or only the malicious and/or negligent spreading of one and it's
symptoms/damage?  Is the passing of this knowlege to a "random" group of
students (where the professor is probably unable to evaluate each one's
future intentions or views of morality) an unethical, if not illegal, act?

Disclaimer: The above are my views, not my employer; I have not had direct
contact with the professor or his students.

Subj:	[1825] RE: Re: major VMS security problems

There's NO glaring hole in VMS security currently (to the best of anyone's
knowledge).  The current security patch that DEC is distributing is their way
of trying to be responsive to all us customers who jumped all over them when
the CHAOS feces hit the fan.  

DEC found flaws in their VMS Workstation Software (VWS) AFTER they had released
V4.7.  That is why the cover letter says the patch has to be re-applied each
time you upgrade to a new version which is lower than 4.7.  The VWS apparently
has been around since 4.3, which is why the release covers all versions of
VMS from 4.3 to 4.7 inclusive.

I'd like to commend DEC for the effort they are putting forth.  Put yourself
in their place.  Here you are, a large company, and your product is found to
have flaws that could cause certain systems in certain instances to compromise
the security they may be relying on.  What's the best way to "strongly suggest"
that your customers implement the patch you have devised?

I think they did a good job.  We all wish VMS was bug-free, but when you're
developing a product in a competitive environment, the faster you can get it
out, the more money you can make.  And unfortunately, we live in a money-based
society.

The patch to SYS.EXE appears to have something to do with the page-faulting
algorithm or working-set adjustment according to what I remember seeing in 
the fiche when I checked to see what it was patching.  This also appears to
be a retro-fit for all 4.7 and under versions.

Before you criticize DEC, first put yourself in their shoes and see if you
can come up with a better idea, keeping in mind that YOU are one of the 
customers you would have to make happy.

BC-EXCLUSIVE-COMPUTE-1stadd
NYT NEW YORK: the intrusions.

    According to the Lawrence Berkeley officials, the yearlong
investigation involved the FBI and security experts from the Air Force
and the Army, as well as private security investigators. Under West
German law, not enough evidence was obtained for prosecution, the
Lawrence Berkeley officials said.
    According to Stoll, the West German compromised the military computers
by taking advantage of security loopholes in several different
operating systems, the software programs that manage data in a
computer. On computers operating under the Unix system, he frequently
used a loophole to give himself ''superuser'' status, which allowed him
to read and alter all material stored in the computer.
    The intrusions involved a variety of U.S. military computer systems in
this country, Europe, and Japan. The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory
became a starting point for connecting to two unclassified military
networks, known as Milnet and Arpanet. They link computers at military
bases and military contractors.
    At one computer at the Naval Coastal Systems Command, in Panama City,
Fla., the intruder transferred to a computer in West Germany an
encyrpted file containing user passwords. The intruder broke some of
the codes and called back to search through files protected by the
passwords. The intruder also gained acess to computers at the Army's
Fort Buckner base in Japan and at the Anniston Army Depot, a supply
base for the Army's Redstone Arsenal, in Huntsville, Ala.
    At the Air Force Systems Command, in El Segundo, Calif., the intruder
managed to attain the status of system manager. ''I watched as he
scanned all of their SDI references and the usual pile of things and
then started printing out information on the space shuttle,'' said
Stoll. ''The Air Force later told me it was not classifed information.''
    Other systems entered included military computers in San Diego, the
Pentagon's Optimus data base, and a computer at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, in Pasadena, Calif.
    The officials at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory said that they
monitored attempted intrusions into a total of 450 military computers.
    ''Basically, he was walking down the street twisting the doorknob of
each house,'' Stoll said. ''He wouldn't push hard, but then he would go
around and do the electronic equivalent of trying the back door and the
side windows. If they didn't budge, he would go to the next house on
the street.''
    Shortly after discovering the intrusions, Stoll, aided first by City
of Berkeley officials and later by federal law-enforcement officers,
began trying to trace their origin. They were traced to a computer at a
U.S. military contractor in McLean, Va., near Washington. The Lawrence
Berkeley officials declined to identify the company.
    They then discovered that the intruder was dialing from Hanover to a
university computer in Bremen, West Germany. That computer was used to
connect to machines in the United States.
    The intruder's location was masked by dialing into the military
contractor's computer in Virginia and then using that computer's
capability to call other computers around the country, including those
at Lawrence Berkeley. The Lawrence Berkeley computer was used to
connect to the military networks - Arpanet and Milnet - to gain access
to the military installations.
    In tracing the intruder, the security investigators created an
automatic alarm system. Stoll wrote a computer program that would dial
his pager whenever the West German gained access to the computer at
Lawrence Berkeley. The pager automatically called a security official
from the Tymnet McDonnell-Douglas Network Systems Co., a computer
network company based in San Jose, Calif. The Tymnet official then
notified West German law enforcement officials.
    But the investigators traced the calls back to Hanover, where it took
as long as 30 minutes to set up a trace because of antiquated
equipment. The intruder's calls generally lasted no longer than five
minutes.
    In January of 1987, the security managers at Lawrence Berkeley created
an electronic sting operation using a large file of fictitious,
seemingly secret information. The file contained a reference to an
address at the Berkeley laboratory where further information related to
the Strategic Defense Initiative could be obtained.
    Once the file was discovered, the intruder remained connected to the
Lawrence Berkeley computer for more than an hour. Three months later,
according to the Lawrence Berkeley officials, a letter was mailed from
a United States citizen living in the Northeast to the address given by
the lab, inquiring about the false SDI information.
    The letter was given to the FBI.

Subj:	[1280] Viral Code

I have recently been assigned the task to make sure that the Departmental
computers (macintoshes, as well as some IBM's..) are virus free.  This should
prove to be quite a task seeing as how the faculty members love to get a
hold of all the PD and shareware stuff that they can get their hands on.

Basically what I have decided to do is to write my own application and or
protecting CDEV (on the order of Vaccine) to deal with any virus problems
which we may have.  I would greatly appreciate it if anyone who has been
bitten by one of these beasties or anyone who has trapped one without being
bitten could send me the source/object code to it/them.  I would be willing
to correspond in any way necessary (US Snail Mail, Bitnet, direct modem
transfer, disks, tapes, etc..).  As for making use of some of the applications
which are already out there, well call me overly paranoid, but I really dont
trust anything anymore that I dont have a copy of the source to.

After I write the above, I will post it to the net(s) along with a copy of
the source....

thanx in advance...

I have never seen any info about tests of that sort... It sounds kind
of pointless to perform this sort of test on a Medeco though.  Once
you know pin heights, you still don't know the rotation of the assorted
pins, so you still have a decent number of permutations in order to find
the correct combination.  I can see more use in performing this sort of

owned telephone company, has fitted the susceptible booths with Kirk safes.
Named after the worker who invented them, the safe has so far proved 100-
percent effective. As mentioned in the Sydney Morning Herald, it has with-
stood 'oxy torches, ramset guns, angle-grinders, hydraulic jacks, pulley
clamps, centre-punches and bricks.' Ironically, the new safes appear to have
led to an increase in vandalism, as theives frustrated by the tough safes
vent their anger on the booths. Telecom reports that the current rate of
smashed glass and ruined handsets and cords is at a new high of 3,000 cases
per month.

My opinion is as follows:

The computer user has NO legal obligation to inform other users or the 
manufacturer of a newly discovered bug in the operating system.  However
if knowledge of the bug is used to exploit OTHER people's operating
systems, then the user has committed a crime.  If that machine is
located in another U.S. state, or is a U.S. Government-owned machine,
then the user has committed a felony.

If the user wanted to inform the computer manufacturer.  He/She should call
the general offices, and tell the secretary that they wish to discuss
a newly-found security bug with the appropriate person(s) within their 
company.  They will be routed through a maze of phone numbers and will 
eventually come upon the correct ears.

I don't think the concept of a virus applies to ATMS. They're not
constantly being exposed to random unverified software. Now if one of
the Bank or atm companies programs tries something funny, you might
be in trouble, but I hope I am not being too optimistic in assuming
that such software gets scrutinzed throughly before it get used. The
main point is that ATMS are not general purpose computers, and don't
need an operating system, so all the standard hooks that a virus would
use to gain a toehold just do not exist.

	the ATM is instanteanous.....this is wierd, either the PIN is
	stored on the card (read: very stupid) or the machine just
	ignores the PIN of credit cards.....

Some ATM systems store the PIN encrypted on the card, just like Unix
passwords. If the encryption algoritm is truly one-way, this is safer,
but stil doesn't protect against a forged card if you know the
encryption algorithm.

Once when I entered my PIN number incorrectly I was surprised when the
machine accepted it and went to the next stage of the menu, but when I
finally did something that requred the machine to contact the host
computer, it barfed and made me type the PIN again. This is an odd
system, but at least it seems secure.

Subj:	[1013] Re: Challenge-Response alternative to Passwords

Just for information I would like to describe briefly here our
proposed solution to the vulnerability of passwords.

At CERN we are installing Security Dynamics software on our CRAY
UNICOS system. This software requires that every authorised user
be issued with a SecurId card which displays a password which
changes every 30 seconds and is, I guess, the ultimate in
dynamic passwords. In addition, every user must have a PIN
so that possession of the card alone is insufficient. When a
user attempts to login he is prompted for his PIN and current
passcode instead of his UNICOS password. We believe this
system to be very difficult to break even with continuous
monitoring of lines or networks. It makes life a little more
difficult for the user but a lot more difficult for crackers.

We have also extended this system to cover batch job submission,
to prevent tampering with batch jobs, and to verify user
authorisation even when jobs are stored and forwarded and
possible monitored by an unauthorised person.

ACF2/MVS releases 3.1 through 4.0 (C2).  A C2 system is more

evaluated for VM, and that is ACF2/VM, which got a C2 rating.

I have never used MVS, but I have worked with ACF2/VM and I found it
to be an extremely flexible and usable system.  It supports an enormous

The PIN you key in is locally (to the atm) run though a one way
enxryption algorithm with the account # (stored on the card) and
compared with the same thing (again stored on the card).
This means if you know the format of the data written on the card
(ANSI X9.1) and the encryption stuff (ANSI X9.8) you can write
your own cards. Also, in many remote areas where banks feel there's
not as much need for security if the ATM cannot talk to the host it
will perform transactions and just journal them. Cut the phone lines
and Voila! The two year old expired card works again.

professor who thought it would be a good experience for his students, as
a project, to write (each) a virus, and demonstrate that it works."

He relates the havoc in the lab that this project created.  Then he/she

	1. Is "viral education" a good thing?

	2. What are the ethics of such a practice?

	3. Would it be against the spirit or  letter of "freedom of
information" to restrict such teaching and the propagation of such
knowledge?

Perhaps the analogy with biological viruses isn't overworked after
all.  In consideration of such analogy, I submit:

	1. "Viral education" is a good thing.  "Know thine enemy" might
be the appropriate commandment.

	2. The ethics of viral education are, in my view, similar in
computer and biological systems.  If there's any doubt about inadvertant
propagation, the viral education should remain at the prospective and
theoretical levels.  I don't believe, for example, that third year
bio or chem students "create" new viruses by DNA/RNA splicing and other
genetic engineering techniques.  The results would be too
unpredictable.  So it is with computer  viruses.

	3. The propatation of knowledge is one thing.  But for
permitting the propagation of the virus, the prof should be sentenced to
have to use only the little fingers of each hand on his keyboard for the
next five years!

A better approach would be to assign students to write "virus hunting"
or "interferon" programs.  If a "weakened" computer virus is available,
one whose characteristics are sufficiently well-known as to keep it
well-contained, then the students' anti-viral programs could be tested
against it.

I think that both the propagation and passing of said knowledge is at least
unethical and possibly illegal.  Illegal because it could be viewed as
conspiring to commit a crime (malicious use of a virus).  I think that this is
analogous to a counterfeiter giving a class in forgery and requiring the class
to forge currency.  If the class had been given to a group of computer security
specialists with the intent of showing the ease of creating a virus, the
possible results of an infection, and possible countermeasures, then I would
see no problem.  But for the class to be given to a "random" group of students
I find reprehensible.

Cc: security@aim.rutgers.edu

	It strikes me as a poor example of pedagogy.  Biology students
do not experiment with tuberculosis (say) when less virulent examples
that serve the purpose exist.  The instructor should not have permitted
the viruses to have destructive side-effects.

	The general precept in law is that *posession* of information is
never illegal, but *utilizing* it may be.  There are exceptions
(pornography, classified information, and doubtless many other well
intentioned attempts by poorly-informed legislators) but the argument
hinges on whether you consider *transferring* information to be
'utilizing' within the context above.

	I sympathize with the DEC employee who recently posted a message
to the effect that people who discover security flaws should just keep
quiet; in the short term this is a reasonable response.  In the longer
term people should keep in mind that these machines have only been
around for fifty years or so - we don't really have the foggiest idea of
what they might ultimately be good for.  The fact that they happen to be
good for something right now shouldn't be allowed to hinder their
further development.

	Just in passing, I wanted to remark on an interesting point: 
viruses are only really a problem for people who don't distribute source.

	Think about it.

If the attacker knows P(day) (see above) then the security of this method
depends on keeping M secret.  But the M you chose is easy to determine
from just a few examples.

It doesn't matter what C you use if P(day) and M are known.

The only successfull looking system of this type is based on the use
having a small calculator like device that used DES or some other
encryption algorithm to generate the proper response to a challenge

Subj:	[2654] Future Shock Blasts

In the 4/88 issue of Progressive Architecture:

Security: The Next Stage

[...]

Not Just Bricks and Mortar

    Highly developed design tools are beginning to emerge in areas related 
to security.  As has been the case in other areas of design 
(structual and energy systems, for example), engineers are providing
architects with computer-based techniques for analysis and design.
    One such example, apparently unique, is BombCAD(TM), developed
jointly by the Evertt I. Brown Company and the Lorron Corporation to
assess the possible effects of terrorist bombings on buildings and their
components and Occupants.
    In demonstrations of the program, using a hypothetical building and
site, BombCAD's developers are able to show a highly detailed diagram of 
bomb-induced overpressures and impulse loads at interior and exterior points
of the building.  The effiacay of new architectural and site elements - for
example, placing an earth berm at the base of a building, or specifying
stronger glazing and framing members for a lobby partition - can be assessed
readily.
    Much of the knowledge used to develop this software has been available 
in other places (for example, in monographs and tables provided in various
military design manuals and guidelines).  And, as its authors redily 
acknowledge, BombCAD has limitations (one of which is that the program's 
estimate of human injury are based only on primary plast effects, while much
empirical evidence suggest that an equal or greater number of fatalites and 
serious injuries may result from secondary and tertiary effects, such 
as flying debris or subsequent building collapse).  Still there is no denying
that the software integrates existing knowledge and gives it new 
applications.
    As security conerns continue to grow in priority among the traditional
clients for design services, we can expect more design tools of this variety
to emerge. 
- By Thomas Vanier, AIA

[Accompanying the article are two examples of the program output from
a video display]
  In a demonstration of BombCAD analysis, a car bomb (top, show as a 
white star) explodes outside a building lobby.  The program sets shock 
impulse load and overpressures (figures in yellow and red) on key parts
of the building exterior.
    BombCAD also can estimate interior blast loads and overpressures.
Red stars indicate locations of other potential bombs, whose characteristics
and effects can be modeled seperately.  A second example (above) illustrates
one of many possible placements of a so-called briefcase bomb.  The program's
flexibility allows examination of many possible bomb locations and charge 
weights.

It takes me just as long to get a credit card authorization as it does to
make a withdrawal with my ATM card, give or take a few seconds here and there.

  As far as ATM's go, I am not sure but I think that what happens is you
enter an entire transaction and the machine reads some stuff off the card,
then the whole batch gets sent via telecommunications line somewhere where
the transaction is processed and verified, then if cash is wanted, a signal
is sent to the actual ATM machine and you get your bucks and a receipt.  Just
about the only transaction I ever make at ATM's is withdrawals.  If I happen
to type in my PIN incorrectly, it does not immediately warn me, I have to
enter the entire transaction, then wait for the central ATM host to bounce
a warning back to me.  This is hardly instantenous.

Subj:	[2765] Kermit versus login passwords

I recently got the following from our people in our micro-computer section.
I'm no expert on Kermit, but it smells like security, so I thought somebody
on the SECURITY list might be able to help --

                   CAN YOU HELP US?

Script files can be used with KERMIT on microcomputers to
do many things much more efficiently.  Micro Resource Center
staff have been developing script files to log in automatically
to the VAX and CYBER mainframes.

We are quite stumped by one problem and wondered if you
had any suggestions?

Script files can be set up in one of two ways:  (1) the
password to complete your log-in is contained in the
script file, or (2) you manually enter your password
each time you log in.

Our concern is protecting the security of access to your
mainframe accounts.

When the password is contained in the script file itself,
it is not visible on the screen during the execution of
the log in procedure.  Security is protected as people watch
you log in, (they can't see the password, and they can't even
watch your fingers because you aren't typing anything).
However, for those of us with microcomputers that cannot be
locked or are located in semi-public areas, it would take
a very few minutes for a "hacker" to find the script file
and identify a password to any mainframe computer account,
if the script file was left on the hard disk.

Typing the password in manually does nothing to solve this problem.
In Kermit, apparently when the script file is halted to permit
typing from the console, there is no way to prevent
the password from being visible on the screen.  In addition,
we have not been successful in clearing the entire screen
rapidly enough or changing the colors on the screen at that point
to prevent users from viewing the password as they watch you
log in.

This is a section of the script file we have been using to log
in to the VAX with the password included in the script file:
   input 5 Local>
   output c\13
   input 20 Username:
   output MYUSERNAME\13\10
   input 5 Password:
   set input echo off
   output MYPASSWORD\13
   set input echo on
   pause 1

This is a section of the script file we have been using to log
in to the VAX and enter the password manually:
   input 5 Local>
   output c\13
   input 20 Username:
   output MYUSERNAME\13\10
   input 5 Password:
   output @con;                         type in password here
   output \13
   pause 1

I would really appreciate any ideas you might have on how we
can successfully protect access to our passwords to either the
VAX or CYBER mainframes under these conditions, without totally
abandoning the concept of automating our log in procedure
through use of Kermit Script Files.

If it isn't possible, I guess that's useful to know, too!

Thanks.

Subj:	[3531] File: "SECURITY MAIL" being sent to you

I have found many bugs and/or security exposures in MVS and as such have had
to think up a reaction to such finds.  I have done the following:
1. create a proof for submission to the manufacturer,
2. send in a documented error report to the technical rep. and a high ranking
   management type of the manufacturer.

   When after several weeks nothing has happened:
3. send the above mentioned trouble report to <trusted> colleages in other
   computer centers, and have them submit a similar report to the manufacturer.

I have made a policy of never going <public> with such exposures because of the
seriousness of the situation.  Consider a computing center being faced with
an exposure in one of its key software systems (e.g. their transaction system).
What options do they have?
1. They can not remove the software from their systems, that would lose them
   millions of dollars PER DAY.
2. They could try to hack a fix for the exposure.  Estimated time of success
   several weeks of <highly qualified> syspro work.  Risks of malfunction of
   the entire transaction system, no support from supplier.  No dice.
3. Monitor abuse of the exposure.  Difficult.
4. Contact the supplier, explain the predicament and suggest you go looking for
   a replacement of his product.  Usually successful, but it takes about half a
   year for a security fix to arrive.

I think it is immoral towards colleages in your site and other centers to
publicly announce a security leak.  Even discussing it with too many syspro
types is risky, because one of them may be a blabbermouth and spill the news
to an unfriendly hacker or newspaper type.
It happens to be our reality that you cannot close down a system on account of
a security exposure if that system is earning you money.  Fixing it is risky
and difficult, so waiting for you friendly supplier is the best you can do.

In this respect IBM has the best policy I know of:
each contract contains a clause that a security exposure shall be dealt with
within a specific time.  I've seen it work and I am impressed.  Of course
some sites never apply the fix, so not everybody will be covered, but that is
their risk.
Other suppliers (on the IBM market) do not have a similar policy.  I know of
several instances where an exposure was not even fixed after three years.
In one case I persuaded some of my friends to remove the product from their
systems and terminate the contract with the supplier.

I don't want to sound too gloomy, but the morally acceptable method will not
always yield results.  The (in my view) immoral way <may> yield long term
results, but in the period between public exposure and fix your systems are
extremely vulnarable to practically every hacker with assembler knowledge.
In no way can you guard against that many possible perpetrators.

The only argument I can come up with to defend a security through ignorance
policy, is the small number of attempts that will be made on your system.
I <may> be better to keep relatively inexperienced hackers unaware of exposures
when knowledgable folks can find out.  In the worst case it will save you
unscheduled IPLs.

Subj:	[1643] Re: Reporting Security Problems
Cc: security@aim.rutgers.edu

Andy - Many (most?) of the large vendors are on the internet.  (Look at
the .com domain; even IBM is there!!).  DoD Instruction 5215.2, dated
2 Sept. 1986 establishes the Computer Security Technical Vulnerability
Reporting Program (CSTVRP).  It's purpose is to establish "procedures for
reporting all demonstrable (sic) and repeatable technical vunerabilities of
Automated Information Systems (AIS)" and establish "methodologies for
dissemination of vulnerablility information."  Given 5215.2, one might
successfully disagree with you regarding vendors not being able to use
the internet for reporting.

	I tend to agree with many of your statements, but I hope that
I am slightly more optimistic.

Subj:	[842] Encryption Software

We are looking at encryption software for IBM MVS systems. We are aware of
Kryptonite, DEF, Psypher and IBM's product.

1. Are there any others available?
2. Does anyone out there use any of these, and if so would you be willing to
   share your experiences with us, to help us make a choice?
3. Many encryption packages use the DES algorithm. Does this imply any kind
   of compatibility between packages? IE - if a file is encrypted by one
   package using the DES algorithm, can it be decrypted by another package
   which also uses the DES algorithm, assuming that you know the key? This is
   very important if one wants to exchange encrypted files over networks
   between dis-similar computers.

Subj:	[667] Security of TV broadcasts

I have a question about the security of TV broadcast systems.  We've all heard
of "Captain Midnight" and his interruption of HBO (or was it Showtime?) using
a satellite up-link.

The other night, while I was watching "Conan the Destroyer" (no comments about
my taste in movies please), a message came on in plain white letters overlaying
the bottom of the screen: "This program brought to you by the association of 
american leprosy societies."

This was on cable, watching a LA broadcast channel.  Does anyone know how this
could have occured?  Sorry, I don't have a video tape to back up my claim, it
was out on loan (why do you think I was watching Conan?).

For the second time in six months, I'm being forced to flee yet another
doomed machine.  We're selling the Vax 785 called aim.rutgers.edu, and moving
to a sun 4.  The boss-man wanted a faster machine, liked the other sun 4's we
already have, and decided to get one; in addition, the resale value of the
785 drops daily, so all of this comes at somewhat short notice.  Needless to
say the Security list has to move somewhere too, and since the rest of the
world seems to be going to Unix, I might as well sit down and learn how to
make sendmail stand on its head and handle the list.  This transition in
theory will be transparent -- I'll move the list's mechanism and messages to
the new machine at some point and start sending from there.  That machine
will probably answer as aim.rutgers.edu when we get everything going right.
I don't want to announce an official change until I know how to handle things
over there and write a zillion emacs macros, but things may fall fairly silent
with regard to remailing while I'm teaching myself and the new machine how
to deal with it.

Subj:	[4358] Sonogramming locks

I'd bet that the sonogram equipment and techniques used on people would be
pretty useless on a Medeco-sized lock.  First, the things you're looking at
are much smaller.  Second, the speed of sound in metal is, I believe, much
higher than water (people), meaning the electronics must switch between
pulsing and receiving much faster (definitely not impossible, just the
"baby-watching" stuff probably won't hack it).  Third, you probably only
have access to the front face of the lock (if you have access to the sides
and top, just open it up) and that means you'd be "looking" at the pins
all at once; you'd rather have a side view so as to see them individually.

I sent a long response to the original poster of the question about using
sound waves; I guess I should have kept a copy to send to the group.  My
own speculation of such techniques involves using one of two methods.
First method:  The "time domain reflectometry" type.  Using a key-shaped
holder if possible, hold a transducer against the bottom of a pin.  Repeatedly
(1 kHz?) send a pulse out of it, switch to receive mode, and display the
echos on a 'scope and time them.

Second method: resonance.  Again hold a transducer against the pin.  Sweep
a range of frequencies (50-250 kHz or so) and look for resonances as
indicated by peaks and dips in the induced voltage (you'd have to play
with the impedances to get the right "Q" for optimum sensing).

Several factors effect how well either method works.  Keep in mind that
round-trip time for a pulse in a .1" pin made of metal with speed of sound
around 3000fps is 5 microseconds; corresponding resonant frequency is 200
kilohertz.  Very thin pins (as used in some mastering methods) would be
even "quicker".  You must (or should) know the pin material, since I would
guess speed of sound is quite different in steel versus brass, and maybe
significantly so in differing types of brass (I don't have the proper
references handy).  Some "pin assemblies" consist of a steel ball contacting
the key followed by a brass pin, so that can be nasty (but easy to discover
with a flashlight); perhaps the ball would yield a distinctive "signature"
on the instrument, or perhaps it would obscure desired signal.  The pins
should ideally be isolated from the lock body but that's impossible, so
I'd guess it would be best to thoroughly clean the lock with a fast-drying
liquid that leaves no residue.  On the other hand, getting some graphite
or teflon particles in there might help "insulate" the pins.  You'd have
to try it and see.  I have no idea how badly misleading or mangled a
signal would be from mushroom pins.  You might get a false sense of a
possible shear line from locks constructed with a second cylinder (a
better mastering technique, as used at least on better Russwins) depending
on how much signal got conducted from the pins into the body.  Such diversion
of signal would also degrade the system's response (e.g. echo strength).
If there are many pins involved, the multiple echos and/or resonance modes
could be pretty hairy to sort out, except for the first pin or two.

Question: "WHY?"  Sounds a bit like a high-tech B&E tool.  Yeah, but even
a screwdriver can be used for illicit gains.  It is obviously a useful
item to ponder for legitimate locksmith use, such as very secure installations
where the key was lost and no copy existed.  This would be very expensive
to buy if it were available, or non-trivial to build in either case, and
most of the bad guys couldn't cut a key if you handed them the cut numbers
or a blueprint.  Significant skilled "interpretation" might be required
as well, if the methods work at all.

One last thought:  Yes, knowing the pin heights on a Medeco doesn't get you
in.  But there's only three possible rotations for each pin, so heights
gets you a lot farther than knowing nothing.  A neat feat of miniature
machining would be to make a Medeco key (as keys go they're rather big)
with shim-adjustable heights and rotatable "seats" for the pins.  Making one
that could be adjusted while seated in the lock would be even better,
best if you could transmit back some "feel" to the operator.

P.S. I probably have the speed of sound in metal way off.  Air is 1100fps
I think, and I vaguely recall it is 6 times that in steel.  Maybe one
could steal techniques from reflection seismology too.

Subj:	[4004] how not to rob a bank

			RULES FOR BANK ROBBERS
 
  According to the FBI, most modern-day bank robberies are "unsophisticated
and unprofessional crimes," comitted by young male repeat offenders who 
apparently don't know the first thing about their business.  This information
was included in an interesting, amusing article titles "How Not to Rob a Bank,"
by Tim Clark, which appeared in the 1987 edition of The Old Farmers Almanac.
 
  Clark reported that in spite of the widespread use of surveillance cameras,
76 percent of bank robbers use no disquise, 86 percent never study the bank
before robbing it, and 95 percent make no long-range plans for concealing the
loot.  Thus, he offered this advice to would-be bank robbers, along with 
examples of what can happen if the rules aren't followed:
 
  1. Pick the right bank.  Clark advises that you don't follow the lead of the
fellow in Anaheim, Cal., who tried to hold up a bank that was no longer in 
business and had no money.  On the other hand, you don't want to be too 
familiar with the bank.  A California robber ran into his mother while making
his getaway.  She turned him in.
 
  2. Approach the right teller.  Granted, Clark says, this is harder to plan.
One teller in Springfield, Mass., followed the holdup man out of the bank and
down the street until she saw him go into a restaurant.  She hailed a passing
police car, and the police picked him up.  Another teller was given a holdup
note by a robber, and her father, who was next in line, wrestled the man to the
ground and sat on him until authorities arrived.
 
  3. Don't sign your demand note.  Demand notes have been written on the back 
of a subpoena issued in the name of a bank robber in Pittsburgh, on an envelope
bearing the name and address of another in Detriot, and in East Hartford, 
Conn., on the back of a withdrawal slip giving the robber's signature and
account number.
 
  4. Beware of dangerous vegetables.  A man in White Plains, N.Y., tried to
hold up a bank with a zucchini.  The police captured him at his house, where he
showed them his "weapon."
 
  5. Avoid being fussy.  A robber in Panorama City, Cal., gave a teller a note
saying, "I have a gun.  Give me all your twenties in this envelope."  The 
teller said, "All I've got is two twenties."  The robber took them and left.
 
  6. Don't advertise.  A holdup man thought that if he smeared mercury ointment
on his face, it would make him invisible to the cameras.  Actually, it 
accentuated his features, giving authorities a much clearer picture.  Bank
robbers in Minnesota and California tried to create a diversion by throwing 
stolen money out of the windows of their cars.  They succeeded only in drawing
attention to themselves.
 
  7. Take right turns only.  Avoid the sad fate of the thieves in Florida who
took a wrong turn and ended up on the Homestead Air Force Base.  They drove up
to a military police guardhouse and, thinking it was a toolbooth, offered the
security men money.
 
  8. Provide your own transportation.  It is not clever to borrow the teller's
car, which she carefully described to police.  This resulted in the most 
quickly solved bank robbery in the history of Pittsfield, Mass.
 
  9. Don't be too sensitive.  In these days of exploding dye packs, stuffing 
the cash into your pants can lead to embarrassing stains, Clark points out,
not to mention severe burns in sensitive places--as bandits in San Diego and
Boston painfully discovered.
 
  10. Consider another line of work.  One nervous Newport, R.I., robber, while 
trying to stuff his ill-gotten gains into his shirt pocket, shot himself in
the head and died instantly.  Then there was the case of the hopeful criminal
in Swansea, Mass., who, when the teller told him she had no money, fainted.
He was still unconscious when the police arrived.
 
  In view of such ineptitude, it is not surprising that in 1978 and 1979, for
example, federal and state officers made arrests in 69 percent of the bank
holdups reported.
