Nope, not any more.  Now Ademco has a long range wireless xmitter (two way, or
one way) which hooks up to your alarm system and can act as the stand alone
transmission device or as a redundant circuit to the phone line connection.

Basically, in the one way connection, the xmitter sits idle if not triggered
and does nothing (except send in an ACK signal to tell the receiver at the
central station "I'm Here, everything's cool"), until the alarm is triggered.

When the alarm is triggered it sends the account #, and "popped" zone over the
radio waves (about 900 MHz), and is repeated by local "nodes" till received
by the CS....

The two way model is continously sending Acks back and forth to the CS, but has
a 6 minute "drop out" window in case of intereference.....costs more to monitor
per month, but is twice as secure.....something like a UL AA rating...

I do not know what part of the country you are in, but I live in
Maryland (the ancestral home of goody twoshoes, and test market for
all future restrictions on American's rights). Here no locksmith, or
locksmith supply house, or hardware store will sell you key blanks.
Of course, the real reason for the restriction is to "lock up" the
keymaking business as a big money-maker for the locksmiths. What they
tell those who try to buy blanks is that you must be a licensed lock-
smith. I tried to buy a lousy flat blank to make a key for a microscope
cabinet and was refused out of hand. I even tried bringing the cabinet
with me to show them what I wanted it for, but was still refused. At
least here in Maryland these are not weak attempts, they are absolute
and total restrictions. For my part, rather than give ANY money at all
to these profit-hungry, blood-sucking "artisans" I will go to my grave
never having seen the insides of the nine cabinets that I need keys
for.

Now that I have vented my spleen on the subject of refusal on the
part of locksmiths to dispense keyblanks I DO have a constructive
solution to the problem. At virtually every flea market you will
find one or more people selling rings, or strings, or cans or
boxes full of old keys, and at ridiculously low prices (I paid $3
for a can containing 147 keys). Although it may involve consider-
ably more effort than working from "blank" key blanks, it is
quite possible to reshape existing keys to fit other locks. In a
few cases it is possible to find keys that require only a touch
of the jewelers file here and there to fit another lock. I have
done this successfully on quite a few occasions. In other cases
I have found exact matches, sometimes in unusual ways. I bought
a small, nineteenth century, mahogany box that was locked and
required a small "skeleton" key. At another time I bought a small
Reichert microscope from the turn of the century that came with
a locked, leather-covered box. Just on a whim I tried the micro-
scope key in the mahogany box and found it an exact match. The
two locks are half a century apart in manufacture.

I guess the bottom line is, that as our country becomes more and
more restrictive, it will be necessary to counter by becoming more
and more innovative.

This would be pretty sophisticated gear.  Police use several VHF and UHF
bands and civilian radios operate within fairly close range of the police
frequencies.

Detecting police while ignoring tow trucks, buses and utility company
radios would require selective detection of many frequency ranges on several
bands.

The complete answer to this question will have to await a day when I

standards require it.  Note also that there are more than ten milllion
terminals and another ten million terminal emulators with this "feature"

I have found it very easy to detect police hand-helds, and, sometimes, mobile
sets. Some of the recent Motorola hand-helds (the HT-220 series and on) emit
such strong signals that I have picked them up as much as 200 feet away on my
Pro-30 with it in my back pocket. The radios operate on UHF with repeaters and
I pick up the signals on the repeater output frequency. 

Of course, there are those who would say that "That's impossible!" but it
does in fact happen with my radios and I don't worry about whether it's
possible or not. It happens, it works, no problem. I do not know if it works
with all makes of radios, though. 

That is one method that may work. Others are to set your scanner to pick up
the local oscillator frequency or even the transmit frequency in case the
transmitter oscillator aways idles during receive.

Subject: Credit Card Fraud...
To: misc-security@rutgers.edu

Something interesting that I heard was going on at [eastern college] was
that a couple of students were able to get a hold of a credit-card
magnetic stip recorder somehow.  They also stole purses, wallets, anything
that they could get their hands on that had credit cards in it.

After doing the above, they would dig through dumpsters (we all know that
story) and pick up carbons or other receipts that have credit card
numbers on them, and make a list of valid card numbers.

Using the encoding machine, they then erased the old card number off
of the magnetic strip (which had probably been reported stolen by
this time) and encoded on that same strip one of the card numbers
that they had picked up out of the dumpsters.

So now they have say a MasterCard with an invalid number embossed on
the front of it, and a different-but-valid account on the magnetic
strip.  What good is this?  Plenty good for the clever thief!

They then went into shopping malls or anywhere that the credit-card
validation machines were the all-too-familiar "slide the card through
and read the number off the mag strip" type.

The merchant would authorize the card successfully and get an approval 
code, then run the card though and get a paper receipt.  The merchants
never check the card number on the authorization machine display and
compare it to that of the card!

When the merchants send in the credit card slips to the bank, they of
course come back, and I imagine it takes a long time to figure out
what exactly happened.

Merchants beware!

                          Sixth Annual Computer Security
                              Applications Conference

                                December 3-7, 1990
                                 Tucson, Arizona

           The Conference

               Operational  requirements  for   civil,   military,   and
           commercial  systems  increasingly  stress  the  necessity for
           information to be readily accessible.  The Computer  Security
           Act  of  1987 requires that all Federal agencies take certain
           actions to improve  the  security  and  privacy  provided  by
           federal  computer systems. Accomplishing both operational and
           security  requirements  requires  the  application   of   the
           maturing technology of integrated information security to new
           and existing systems throughout their life cycle.
               This conference will explore technology applications  for
           both  civil  and  military systems; the hardware and software
           tools  and  techniques  being  developed  to  satisfy  system
           requirements;  and  specific examples of systems applications
           and implementations.  Security policy  issues  and  standards
           will also be covered during this five day conference.

           Papers, Tutorials, and Vendor Exhibits

               Technical  papers  and   tutorials   that   address   the
           application  of  integrated information security technologies
           in  the  civil,  defense,  and  commercial  environments  are
           solicited.  Original  research,  analyses  and approaches for
           defining the computer security issues and problems identified
           in  the Conference's interest areas; secure systems in use or
           development;  methodological  approaches  for  analyzing  the
           scope  and  nature of integrated information security issues;
           and potential solutions are of particular interest.   We  are
           also  interested  in vendor presentations of state-of-the-art
           information security products.

           INSTRUCTIONS TO AUTHORS:
               Send five copies of your paper or panel proposal  to  Dr.

SSD stands for solid state device as opposed to spinning ferrous oxide.
Think STK SSD are backed by spinning Winchesters or the like. Anybody who
puts precious stuff on this type device is asking for big trouble. They
break a lot. If they insist on doing this,I can only address paging and RACF.
Should use as secondary paging only, newer levels of VM figure out which
devices are responding and eventually start using "better thruput" devices.

If used as primary can't IPL when they fail(and they will). Haven't seen a
shop where RACF was a large enough bottleneck to risk this. Don't think
they're even going to put RACF on them just some "look up" files. Cached
devices like IBM 3880-23 or 3990-3 provide sufficient performance for RACF
datasets on a "properly tuned" storage farm.

This type of outage is a small concern to us, but valid. RACF runs a secondary
database that we can switch to on the fly should we lose the primary RACF
volume. We also make regular copies of the databases and could do standalone
restores if required.

Further, a new feature of the 3990 is dual write capability. That is while
updating files on a volume the same files are updated on the clone. Should
anything happen to primary, the clone automagically kicks in. Being of the
conservative ilk, waiting to see who's tried this(successfully)

  Last fall at the Univ. of NE-Lincoln several students used there class
(computer) accounts in one of the computer user rooms to telnet (via

anyone with an account can telnet where ever they want to as long as they

a computer game on this Europe computer (via telnet) with other users

Student Code conduct and the director of the University computing resources
wasn't to happy that they were playing games.  Now when one enters a computer
user room s/he clearly sees bold sign posted stating that Hacking or game
playing on university computers is more or less illegal.  My thought is that
those are loose terms and often applied and read in the general public.

  What is Hacking?  Is it what people did in the late 70's with Apple II
computers or Macs?  Is it righting efficient code (theres plenty of people,
to many that is, that right sloppy code)?  Is it an intermidiate step between
a new computer user and a computer guru?  Is it somebody who writes in
assembler or rights code(works) at very odd hours during the day?  Hacking
is a very non-descriptive word and must not be used or that the context its
used in must be the descriptive part, which makes using the term "hacker"
unnecessary.  But the public has come to notice "hacker" as an icon for,
corrupt, evil, criminal oriented, etc.... is what a believe a hacker was not

Would not a simpler rule be "Commit a felony: go to jail"?  Why involve
computers in the discussion?

DEC reported repairing this vulnerability somewhere in the VMS V3 time frame
(at least 5 years ago) with respect to the MAIL utility by screening text and
not transmitting arbitrary control characters to recipient terminals. Since
the author suggests that the "user authorization program" was originally
protected against end-user access, presumably the operating system environment
is not standard VMS (where the *program* allows world read). Using that
technique for any programs whose output can be controlled by another user
would be my suggestion.

Of course nothing is going to protect the privileged user who chooses to
*run* a program from an untrusted source, since that program might trigger
the answerback itself or might fail to screen user data for arbitrary
control characters.

I was under the impression that the released version of Ultrix (the version
of UNIX sold by DEC) did not have the sendmail debugging feature turned on,
while some other versions of UNIX which run on VAXen did have it turned on.
Restricting discussion for a moment to the vulnerability introduced by that
feature(?), "Who ya gonna sue?".  Do UNIX fans think the Trustees of U.C.
Berkeley would allow the organization to release any software if there were
such financial risks involved?

Not the least factor influencing vendors is user insistance on wart-for-wart
compatibility between UNIX systems.  Even VMS-only users get hit if they
choose the C programming language because of many bugs/misfeatures which are
present in the run-time library solely to make the environment "like-UNIX".
Maintaining a particular operating system definition can be incompatible with
avoiding security or operational defects.  The customer base cannot constrain
vendors with mutually exclusive conditions.

Thermic Lances produce enormous amounts of smoke when they cut through
concrete reinforced safe walls or doors.  This is sure to set off
fire alarms and thermal attack alarms.  In addition, the large plume
of smoke rising from a bank across town might tip off the police.

These cutting tools produce blindingly bright light that is visible
for great distances unless shielded.

I've used mini-lances a few times and even they are not for the faint

   I certainly wouldn't want such a program run on my system without my

the FIELD account.  Which is why ours is normally DISUSERed (disabled) --
that way, I know when it's being used, and why.

Yeah, right. Might as well have them fill in the Grand Canyon using a
pair of tweezers. How about having Robert Morris implement the Gnu
kernel? I'm sure he's bright enough to come up with a very secure
system (much to rms's disgust). So secure that only he would know the
loopholes.

Morris would be dead meat if his daddy didn't work for the NSA.

One of the first patches for sendmail that was sent around to keep the
Internet worm out was to edit the sendmail binary changing the 'D' in
"DEBUG" to '\0', so the DEBUG command wouldn't work any more. Well
that stopped the worm, but it made the null string invoke the debug
command. I noticed this a couple days after the worm, when I telneted
to sun.com port 25, to EXPN a user name of somebody on a mailing list
I run, hit CR a couple of times to make sure sendmail was listening,
and did the EXPN. It spit back huge ammounts of debugging information!
Of course I promptly notified the appropriate people at Sun so they
could put the right fix in. Sheez.

The catch here is that it is not illegal to listen to the broadcast
conversation, but it IS illegal to disclose any information you obtain.
Reference the Communications Act of 1934.  For example I can hear someone say
"OK, drop the illegal controlled substance under the bridge and I will
pick it up" but it is illegal for me to call the police and describe the
pending transaction.  Likewise it is illegal for the police to disclose,
as evidence in court or for a search warrant, such information.  It is not
impossible for them to select their actions based on this info, though,
such as stopping him for speeding on his way back from the pick-up and
searching the car if he acts strangely.

At least, that's my interpretation of the Act.  It does not seem to be
enforced very well of late.  For example, when recording a phone call you
are supposed to superimpose a beep to let the other party know the
conversation is being recorded, but most (recorded) phone-in radio/TV
shows do not do this (they did in the late 50's and early 60's).

If my understanding of the Act is correct, the privacy is in fact surrendered
but only as far as the person doing the original eavesdropping.  It is illegal
to record or disclose.  But the first person might be taping the call or even
pumping it over the company intercom, for all the second person knows!

I'd very much like to have a copy of SW_INVENTORY.COM myself to aid in
tracking software usage. We, like many other college sites, have blanket
licenses for pretty much all the software DEC sells. We are, however,
required to monitor its installation and usage on our various systems
and report it to DEC. The problem is that our systems are managed by
a large number of people, with varying degrees of ability/responsibility/
authority. It would be a real help if we could run something that would
simply tell us what's installed, rather than relying on reports that are
often forgotten or incorrect. PAKs don't help much since DEC in their
wisdom provides product PAKs in an all-or-nothing fashion. It is the
actual installation of the software that counts, not the PAK.

As far as DEC is concerned, I fail to see how SW_INVENTORY.COM would tell
them much. With the advent of CD-ROM distributions, you can install
practically anything DEC sells without actually being able to use it. I
suspect that this is the reason SW_INVENTORY.COM has fallen into disuse,
rather than concerns about customer security.

Insofar as this represents a breach of security, if you're relying on
lack of physical access to prevent this sort of traffic analysis, you're
dreaming. Assuming that you're honest and you're not running software
you're not entitled to use, DEC's own records of software sales to you
are probably a more reliable indication of what you're doing. I suppose
you could pretend to buy the software for some other system (which may well
be illegal), but in the long run, do you seriously think you can fool
people? Note also that the software you have may in fact be a red herring;
I think a look at stuff like the usernames, load averages, programs used
(especially accounting logs), and so forth would be a much better place to
start nosing around. And it may not be practical to deny your vendor access
to this sort of information (e.g. a bug which only manifests itself under
load -- I practically never see any other kind these days, now that static
analysis of program code is so good).

I had never heard of these things before.  How can I tell the difference

must be some kind of lens, where is it located?

For that matter, what are other common disguises for cameras or bugs?

[Moderator add-on: I saw some of these at Surveillance Expo last December.
They are built into regular sprinkler heads which have been slightly
modified to fit a small mirror assembly.  Basically it's a pinhole lens
looking straight down through where the water would normally emerge,
with a small mirror mounted in a holder at 45 degrees so the camera's
view is out sideways and slightly downward [adjustable].  You would
have to stare really hard at them, especially considering that sprinkler
heads are normally mounted on the ceiling.  The advantage besides
unobtrusiveness is that the mirror assembly can turn, allowing a 360
degree scan which a normal camera needs a fancy motorized bracket for.

The company there that was marketing the things is Visual Methods, in
Westwood NJ.    _H*]

I have read a lot about security in the UNIX environment in the Newsgroup:
misc.security. One of the things I am interested in I did not spot however
and I am wondering whether you could help me. 

But first of all, I would like to tell you who I am and why I am interested
in security. 
My name: Hans van Zanten
My firm: Philips Netherlands 
The department I am working with is called "Communication and Processing 
Services" (about 1000 employees) and is the EDP department of Philips
in the Netherlands. Although most of the Business processing done is still on
IBM mainframes, UNIX is starting to rise. In technical environments however
UNIX is, of course, becoming quite standard.

One of the main problems I am facing at the moment is the lack of skill of
UNIX system administrators in the Business environment. 
My work (software supporting just these system administrators) is to make
sure that their UNIX system is configured properly secure. In order to
be able to 'audit' their systems (preferably in an automated way) I would like
to get hold of 'auditing tools' (e.g. for scanning all the s-bits in the file-
system, or to report on permission settings of complete file-systems, etc.).

My question to you is whether you know of such tools, do they exist, to
whom should I address myself to obtain possibly some more information.

I would be very greatfull to receive some information on this subject and I
hope you do not mind me addressing these quetions to you,

Yeah, the mod's wisecrack is one idea....and so is the infamous Radio Shack..
they sell an entry alarm that gets screwed/double stick taped onto the door...
put in a chime mode it goes "ding/dong" when the door opens....or has a
siren mode that blasts the hell out of an intruder.  I successfully used the
chime mode over a period of two months late at night to get a roommate in
a college dorm to move out (*devilish smile*) and once when I left the
siren mode on over vacation the device scared the Asst. Res. Hall Director
out of her wits during vacation room checks (needless to say, they kept out
of my room after that...).

OR, you could wire up something with a latching relay and a magnetic contact
that would trigger a small light or a counting module (radio shack again...
about $14.99) so you could keep track of someone entering illegally....or
a sign on the door saying "WARNING: THESE PREMESES ARE ELECTRONICALLY
PROTECTED.  ALL ENTRIES ARE RECORDED FOR INVOLVED PARTIES PROTECTION.  DO NOT
ENTER IF THE ROOM/APARTMENT RESIDENT(S) IS/ARE NOT HOME.  THE POLICE WILL BE
AUTOMATICALLY NOTIFIED UPON UNAUTHORIZED ENTRY..."

A sign such as the above was quite successful in keeping a nosy landlord out
of my apartment.....he asked for the "code" to the alarm, I told him he wasn't
getting it....he said he'd kill the power....I said it had battery backup, he
quoted the lease, I quoted it too and said he had to provide proper notice...

Ok, so I'm rambling....stick with the mag contact, the latching relay, a 9V
battery, a small led, and a reset switch to reset the relay (just have a
N.C. switch on the neg. lead of the battery (in series).  Then to reset
it, press the switch....*poof* power gets cut, relay resets, you are set..

not bad? Hope the above helps...

United States are  a national  responsibility.  They  must be  so
organized and managed as to exploit  to the maximum the available
resources in all  participating departments  and agencies and  to
satisfy  the legitimate  intelligence  requirements  of all  such
departments and agencies.
    I  therefore designate  the Secretaries of  State and Defense
as  a Special  Committee  of the  National  Security Council  for
COMINT,  which  Committee  shall,  with  the  assistance  of  the
Director of  Central Intelligence,  establish policies  governing
COMINT  activities. and keep me advised  of such policies through
the Executive Secretary of the National Security Council.
    I  further designate  the Department of  Defense as executive
agent  of   the  Government,   for  the   production  of   COMINT
information.
    I  direct  this  Special  Committee  to  prepare   and  issue
directives which shall include the provisions set forth below and
such other provisions  as the Special Committee  may determine to
be necessary.

    1.    A   directive  to   the  United   States  Communication
Intelligence  Board  (USCIB).  This  directive will  replace the
National Security Council Intelligence Directive No. 9, and shall
prescribe   USCIB's   new   composition,   responsibilities   and
procedures in the  COMINT fields.   This directive shall  include
the following provisions.
a. USCIB  shall be reconstituted  as a body  acting for
    and  under  the  Special  Committee,  and  shall  operate  in
    accordance with the  provisions of  the new directive.   Only
    those  departments  or  agencies  represented  in  USCIB  are
    authorized to engage in COMINT activities.
b.  The  Board  shall  be  composed  of  the  following
    members:
     (1)  The  Director  of  Central Intelligence,  who shall be
the Chairman of the Board.
     (2) A representative of the Secretary of State.

Bureau of Investigation.
     (5) The Director of the National Security Agency.
     (6) A  representative of  the  Department of  the Army.
     (7) A  representative  of the  Department  of the Navy.
     (8) A representative of the  Department of the Air Force.
     (9) A  representative of the  Central Intelligence Agency.
c. The Board shall have a  staff headed by an executive
    secretary who  shall be  appointed by the  Chairman with  the
    approval of the majority of the Board.
d. It shall be the duty of the Board to advise and make
    recommendations to the  Secretary of  Defense, in  accordance
    with  the  following procedure,  with respect  to  any matter
    relating  to communications  intelligence which  falls within
    the jurisdiction of the Director of the NSA.
     (1) The Board shall reach its decision by majority
vote.  Each  member of  the Board shall  have one  vote
except the  representatives of  the Secretary  of State
and of the  Central Intelligence Agency who  shall each
have two votes.  The  Director of Central Intelligence,
as Chairman, will have no vote.  In the event  that the
Board  votes  and reaches  a  decision,  any dissenting
member  of  the  Board may  appeal  from  such decision
within 7 days of  the Special Committee.  In  the event
that the Board votes but fails to reach a decision, any
member of the  Board may  appeal within 7  days to  the
Special  Committee.    In   either  event  the  Special
Committee   shall   review    the   matter,   and   its
determination thereon shall  be final.  Appeals  by the
Director  of NSA  and/or  the  representatives  of  the
Military  Departments  shall  only  be  filed with  the
approval of the Secretary of Defense.
     (2) If any matter is voted on by the Board but -
(a)  no decision  is reached  and any  member
     files an appeal;
(b)  a  decision  is  reached  in  which  the
     representative  of the  Secretary of  Defense does
     not concur and files an appeal;
no action  shall be taken  with respect to  the subject
matter until the  appeal is decided, provided  that, if
the Secretary of Defense determines, after consultation
with the Secretary  of State,  that the subject  matter
presents a problem of an  emergency nature and requires
immediate action,  his decision  shall govern,  pending
the  result  of  the  appeal.   In  such  an  emergency
situation  the  appeal  may be  taken  directly  to the
President.
     (3)  Recommendations  of  the  Board  adopted   in
accordance  with  the  foregoing  procedures  shall  be
binding on the Secretary of Defense.   Except on matter
which have been voted on by  the Board, the Director of
NSA shall discharge  his responsibilities in accordance
with his own  judgment, subject to the direction of the
Secretary of Defense.
     (4) The Director  of NSA  shall make such  reports
and furnish  such information from time to  time to the
Board,  either orally  or in  writing, as the  Board my
request, and shall bring to  the attention of the Board
either in such reports or  otherwise any major policies
or programs in advance of their adoption by him.
e.   It  shall  also be  the duty  of  the Board  as to
    matters not falling within the jurisdiction of NSA;
     (1) To coordinate the  communications intelligence
activities   among   all   departments   and   agencies
authorized by the President to participate therein;
     (2) To initiate, to formulate policies concerning,
and  subject  to  the  provision of  NSCID  No.  5,  to
supervise all arrangements with  foreign governments in
the field of communications intelligence; and
     (3)   to   consider   and   make   recommendations
concerning   policies   relating    to   communications
intelligence of common interest  to the departments and
agencies, including security  standards and  practices,
and, for  this purpose,  to investigate  and study  the
standards  and   practices  of  such   departments  and
agencies   in   utilizing    and   protecting    COMINT
information.
f. Any recommendation of the Board with respect  to the
    matters  described in paragraph e above shall  be binding on
    all  departments  or  agencies of  the  Government  if  it is
    adopted  by the  unanimous vote of the  members of the Board.
    Recommendations  approved by  the majority,  but not  all, of
    the  members of the Board  shall be transmitted by  it to the
    Special  Committee for  such action as  the Special Committee
    may see fit to take.
g. The Board will meet monthly,  or oftener at the call
    of  the Chairman  or any member, and  shall determine its own
    procedures.
    2. A directive to  the Secretary of Defense.   This
directive shall include the following provisions:
a.  Subject   to  the  specific   provisions  of   this
    directive, the Secretary of  Defense may delegate in whole of
    in  part  authority  over the  Director  of  NSA  within  his
    department as he sees fit.
b. The COMINT  mission of the National  Security Agency
    (NSA) shall be to provide an effective,  unified organization
    and control of the communications  intelligence activities of
    the United States  conducted against foreign  governments, to
    provide for  integrated operational  policies and  procedures
    pertaining thereto.   As  used in  this directive,  the terms
    "communications intelligence"  or "COMINT" shall be construed
    to mean all  procedures and methods used in  the interception
    of communications  other  than foreign  press and  propaganda
    broadcasts  and  the  obtaining  of   information  from  such
    communications by other  than intended recipients,  but shall
    exclude censorship  and the  production and dissemination  of
    finished intelligence.
c. NSA shall be administered  by a Director, designated
    by  the  Secretary of  Defense  after  consultation with  the
    Joint Chiefs of Staff, who shall serve for a  minimum term of
    4  years and  who shall be  eligible for  reappointment.  The
    Director shall be a career commissioned officer of  the armed
    services  on active or reactivated status, and shall enjoy at
    least 3-star rank during the period of his incumbency.
d. Under the  Secretary of  Defense, and in  accordance
    with approved  policies of USCIB,  the Director of NSA  shall
    be responsible  for accomplishing  the mission  of NSA.   For
    this purpose all  COMINT collection and production  resources
    of  the United States  are placed  under his  operational and
    technical  control.    When  action  by  the  Chiefs  of  the
    operating  agencies of the  Services or  civilian departments
    or  agencies is  required, the Director  shall normally issue
    instruction  pertaining to  COMINT operations  through  them.
    However,  due  to the  unique technical  character  of COMINT
    operations,  the Director  is authorized  to issue  direct to
    any  operating elements  under  his operational  control task
    assignments and pertinent  instructions which are within  the
    capacity of such elements to accomplish.  He  shall also have
    direct   access  to,  and   direct  communication  with,  any
    elements  of the  Service or civilian  COMINT agencies on any
    other  matters of operational and technical control as may be
    necessary,  and he  is authorized to  obtain such information
    and intelligence material from  them as he may require.   All
    instruction  issued  by  the  Director  under  the  authority
    provided in this paragraph  shall be mandatory, subject  only
    to  appeal  to  the Secretary  of  Defense  by the  Chief  of
    Service or head of civilian department of agency concerned.
e. Specific  responsibilities  of the  Director of  NSA
    include the following:
     (1)  Formulating  necessary operational  plans and
policies for the conduct of the U.S. COMINT activities.
     (2)   Conducting   COMINT   activities,  including
research and development, as required to meet the needs
of the  departments and agencies which  hare authorized
to receive the products of COMINT.
     (3)  Determining,  and  submitting to  appropriate
authorities, requirements for  logistic support for the
conduct of  COMINT activities,  together with  specific
recommendations  as  to  what each  of  the responsible
departments  and  agencies  of  the  Government  should
supply.
     (4) Within  NSA's field  of authorized  operations
prescribing  requisite  security  regulations  covering
operating   practices,   including   the  transmission,
handling and distribution of COMINT material within and
among  the COMINT  elements  under  his  operations  or
technical   control;   and  exercising   the  necessary
monitoring   and    supervisory   control,    including
inspections if necessary, to ensure compliance with the
regulations.
     (5)  Subject   to  the  authorities   granted  the
Director  Central  Intelligence   under  NSCID  No.  5,
conducting all liaison on  COMINT matters with  foreign
governmental communications intelligence agencies.
f. To  the extent he  deems feasible and  in consonance
    with  the aims  of maximum over-all  efficiency, economy, and
    effectiveness, the Director  shall centralize  or consolidate
    the  performance  of  COMINT   functions  for  which  he   is
    responsible.  It is recognized that in  certain circumstances
    elements of the Armed Forces and other  agencies being served
    will require close COMINT support.  Where necessary for  this
    close  support,  direct  operational  control  of   specified
    COMINT  facilities  and resources  will be  delegated  by the
    Director,  during such  periods  and for  such tasks  as  are
    determined  by him,  to military commanders  or to the Chiefs
    of other agencies supported.
g.  The  Director  shall exercise  such  administrative
    control  over COMINT activities as he  deems necessary to the
    effective   performance   of   his   mission.      Otherwise,
    administrative  control  of  personnel  and  facilities  will
    remain with the departments and agencies providing them.
h.  The Director shall make provision for participation
    by  representatives of  each of the  departments and agencies
    eligible to receive COMINT  products in those offices of  NSA
    where  priorities  of  intercept and  processing  are finally
    planned.
i.  The  Director shall  have  a civilian  deputy whose
    primary responsibility  shall be  to ensure the  mobilization
    and  effective  employment of  the best  available  human and
    scientific  resources in the  field of cryptographic research
    and development.
j.  Nothing  in  this  directive  shall contravene  the
    responsibilities  of the  individual departments and agencies
    for  the  final   evaluation  of   COMINT  information,   its
    synthesis  with  information  from  other  sources,  and  the
    dissemination of finished intelligence to users.
    3. The  special nature of  COMINT actives requires that  they
be treated  in all  respects as  being outside  the framework  of
other  or general  intelligence  activities.   Order, directives,
policies, or recommendations  of any  authority of the  Executive
Branch   relating  to   the  collection,   production,  security,
handling, dissemination, or  utilization of intelligence,  and/or
classified material, shall  not be applicable to  COMINT actives,
unless  specifically   so   stated  and   issued   by   competent
departmental of agency authority represented on the Board.  Other
National Security Council Intelligence Directive to the  Director
of  Central  Intelligence  and  related  implementing  directives
issued by the Director of Central Intelligence shall be construed
as  non-applicable  to  COMINT  activities, unless  the  National
Security Council has made  its directive specifically  applicable
to COMINT.

>This note explores  the legal status of  a surveillance
>technology  ruefully  known  as  TEMPEST[2].

Sorry, Chris.  TEMPEST is the name of a U. S. DoD standard
for permissable emanations from equipment to be employed in
processing certain classified information in certain environ-
ments.    The name of the "surveilance" technology is called
television.  You are correct only to the extent that the code
word is sometimes erroneously used to refer to the vulnerability.
I have never heard it, even erroneously, used to describe the
surveilance.

>Using    TEMPEST
>technology  the  information in  any  digital device  may be
>intercepted  and  reconstructed  into   useful  intelligence
>without the  operative ever having to come  near his target.

Well, near is a relative term.   With hundreds of dollars of
equipment, some luck, and some special knowledge, you might be
able to read a CRT at a distance of tens of meters.  Other
equipment is significantly more expensive.  It is a little easier
on the other side of the pond where the number of scan lines is
higher.  However, to gain useful intelligence, you may also have
to expend tens to hundreds of hours.

Of course, with the resources of a nation state, you might get
the distance up to low hundreds of meters.  Since the data
involved may have a very long life, the expenditure may be
justified.

>The technology is  especially useful in the  interception of
>information  stored  in  digital computers  or  displayed on
>computer terminals.

Close; reading information displayed on CRT's is relatively
easy.  Reading LCDs or gas-panel displays is relatively
difficult.  Reading most storage is virtually impossible.

>    The use of TEMPEST is not illegal under the laws of the
>United  States[3], .......

Well, the use of radios and televisions is not illegal in the US.
As long as you keep everything that you here to yourself, you
have not likely broken any laws.  However, if you use any of that
information to enrich yourself, you may well have.  You may have
broken laws against espionage, copyright laws, or criminal fraud
laws.

US law makes it illegal for you to broadcast certain signals and
for me to sell you equipment that does so.   Nonetheless, you
broadcast information bearing signals at you own risk.

>....or  England.

    Canada has      specific  laws
criminalizing TEMPEST eavesdropping but the  laws do more to
hinder surveillance countermeasures than to prevent  TEMPEST
surveillance.

>In  the United  States it is  illegal for  an
>individual  to  take         effective  counter-measures   against

That is, at best, an overstatement.  As I have said, the law
makes it illegal for you to broadcast certain signals and
certainly does not force you to broadcast any.    It permits you to
employ quiet equipment, such as LCD's or gas-panels.  It permits
me to sell it to you.  It permits you to use ultra-quiet, TEMPEST
capable equipment.  I might even be able to sell you such
equipment, though you would not likely want to pay for most of
it.  For example, certain models of the GRID Case computer were
TEMPEST capable off-the-shelf out-of the-box.

However, without the permission of the DoD, I cannot sell you
equipment which I assert to be TEMPEST qualified.  If I did, and
it were, I might be guilty of compromising classified
information.  If I did, and it were not, I would be guilty of
misrepresentation.  Nonetheless, the intent of the law is to
protect national security interest, not to force you,
gratuitously, to compromise yours, or deny you access to
legitimate measures to do so.

>     The author would        like to suggest that the  solution to

Well, you may suggest what you like; your suggestions may even
be straightforward.  Nonetheless, neither the issue nor the
solution are as straightforward as you imply or as others might
infer.

First, most information is available; I have just given you some.
A great deal of the rest is special knowledge that would not be
meaningful to the average buyer.  The only information that I am
aware of that is, de jure, not available is the TEMPEST standard.

This standard was developed by the US DoD at its own expense for
its own purpose.  That purpose would not be served by its
disclosure.  It is not clear that any public good would be served
by its disclosure.  They are prohibited by a very complex law
from disclosing it to you.  It is not likely that law will be
changed any time soon.

>TEMPEST  Certified equipment  should  be legally
>available; ....

If you can convince anyone else that is useful, develop your own
standard and your own certification program for your own purpose.
You will not succeed in subverting TEMPEST to your purpose.

If you use "private" as opposed to public, then they must have
done so.  If you use "private" as synonomous with sensitve, it
can reasonably expected that they will do so.

Be careful what you ask for; you might get it.

Does anyone know how hard it is to jam or fool these wireless home
security systems?  Couldn't one just use a spectrum analyzer to determine
what sort of signals the sensors sent to the main control unit -- and then
replicate these signals?  For example if I pumped out the signal that meant
"everything is OK" a three watts it would drown out the "door is open" signal
when I broke open a door.  That doesn't sound very secure.

   As an owner of a security system company, I would highly discourage
any wireless alarm that has no form of supervision. There are many types
of alarms that send low battery signals, as well as an "all is well" signal
which, if not received by the control panel every x minutes, will also
sound some kind of alarm. This prevents signal jambing. Personally (insert
my opinion here) I do not like the AT&T wireless system. It seems they
created a lot of hype about it and have exclusive dealers, etc. On company
that installed them had to replace all but 6 (out of about one hundred) units
because of a malfuntion. Even thought they were under warranty, it is still
unreasonable to have to replace that many.

   You may have trouble buying a professional wireless system from a whole-
saler yourself, but many alarm companies are happy to sell them to individuals.

	Maybe, maybe not.  A while ago (10-11 months) I took my dollar
bill down to one of those "Coke and change" soda machines that take
bills, and discovered a very dismayed individual.  He had stuck a five
dollar bill into the machine, gotten his soda, and only 50 cents
change back.  I suspect that the machine probably wasn't out of spare
change, since it gave me my soda and 50 cents, too.  My Coke cost four
dollars less, though.  Obviously, I don't know whether that the bill
reader was at fault, or if the Coke machine just checked to see if the
bill was valid, and assumed that nobody would stick anything but a
single in the slot just because it says to use a one dollar bill on
the outside.

Quite right.  The one I took apart was from a Rowe changer.  We had a problem
with people using xerox copies of dollars.  They would tape pieces of real
dollars to the copy and run it trough.  At other arcades they would then cover
the holes in the real dollars with copys and pass it to busy cashiers.  As long
as you have the important section of a real bill in place the machine can't 
tell the difference.  

Are you sure that the it scanned for light trasmission?  On the models I'm 
used to the optics at the top are just used to sense when a bill is being
inserted, they then activate the feed moter.

Subject: Bicycle locks
To: security@pyrite.rutgers.edu

The previous article on bicycle locks got me interested, so I've been
examining different locks.  (Living in Manhattan, I am able to come
across many broken locks to play with.)

It was mentioned that some bike locks had a rivet that could easily be
removed, letting you pop out the lock cylinder.  The Master brand
Kryptonite-type lock (tube that locks over the open ends of a U-shaped
round bar) has such a rivet, however removing it will not let you open
the lock.  If the lock is opened, you will be able to rotate the cylinder,
but not if it's locked.  In addition, there's a ring around the face of
the cylinder that has to be removed in order to remove the cylinder (and
the lock must be open).  It's as easy to pick as your average Master
padlock, so I wouldn't trust it too much, but it is safe from rivet
removal.

I found another one that I'd strongly recommend you avoid.  The plastic
was partly scraped off, so I couldn't make out the name, but it ends with
NG-TAY.  First, removing the rivet let the cylinder rotate which *did*
let you open the lock.  Second, instead of solid brass top pins, it used
hollow shells that the springs rested in.  This is apparently how the
thief opened the lock - stuck in a screwdriver and gave it a good twist.
The shells crumpled and the lock opened.  Third, it looks like the
serial number printed on the plastic is actually the key levels, so you
could just look at the lock, then make a key to it with a key machine and
a depth-key set.  (I'd have to see another one of these locks to verify
this last point.)

The only place I've ever been asked is in India, four days after one of their
747's was taken out by a luggage bomb.  They were _seriously_ into security at
the time.  Matter of fact, just about the only time I've ever felt security was
being taken seriously at an airport.  (But I've never flown El Al...)
Even then, it wasn't a hassle, I just had to show the man with the submachine
gun what was inside the bag...

More amusing was being interviewed by a local TV crew at the airport, which
asked me "aren't you scared to be flying Air India now?  I mean, you're a
foreigner, why don't you buy a ticket on some other airline..."  (This was the
STATE RUN (and only) TV network in India, mind you...)  Amusingly enough, the
flight was almost empty, (except for victims families being flown to Ireland
to identify the bodies, lotsa laughs on the plane... :-( )

Ford locks have long been notorious for this sort of thing (hence the line

Moaning at car manufacturers for providing rotten security is unlikely to
succeed. They make so much money selling people parts to replace things
smashed by thieves that it's hardly worth their while improving matters.
And, if someone's whole car goes AWOL, well, that's another new car sale

CEO summary:
     When I'm in my car, I always have the 2-meter ham radio tuned to 
145.27 Mhz. The state interdepartmental cop frequency is 158.97 Mhz. 
Whenever I drive through 2 towns in the area, I get an intermittent 
signal which will break my squelch. It only happens outside the PD or 
near a cruiser. They all have scanning receivers and the frequency 
difference is 13.7 Mhz, close enough to IF frequency for me. 
Apparently, there's enough local oscillator leakage out the antenna 
of some of the radios they're using to be detectable a block or so 
away. With the new wideband synthesised radios, the filtering is not 
tight enough to knock down the local oscillator signal enough 
(remember, it's only 10.7 Mhz away from the RX freq. and the band 
runs from 150 - 170 Mhz).

The device was designed to be vehicle mounted (so as to pick up police using

the supposition that the officers left their repeaters on while in the vehicle
[they acknowledged this but claimed that most do in fact leave their repeaters

something was being broadcast.

Subject: Re: cop detectors
To: misc-security@rutgers.edu

Actually, ignoring the other radios might be a trivial task if they operate on
different frequencies than the police.  The problem is that while a police
department might only operate on a small number of frequencies, they can use
any number of different brands and models of radios each having different
intermediate frequencies.  Thus, a number of local oscillator frequencies 
might have to be monitored. It might be possible in any given area for two
different models of radios operating on two different frequencies to have the
same local oscillator frequency, but it is not likely.

Unfortunately, a first intermediate frequency of 10.7 MHz is standard for a 
large number of VHF radios.  In this case the number of local oscillator
frequencies is greatly reduced.  Older models of many radios typically did
not standardize on the IFs in common use today.

A much more difficult problem is the issue of sensitivity.  By FCC rules,
local oscillator radiation must be attenuated to low levels.  These levels are
so low that detection would be nearly impossible over any useful range with
today's radios.  This was not the case with most receivers before the mid-1950s
or so (the ones with the radiating local oscillators - RF amplifier stages
were often not used ahead of the first mixer in early days).  While the
sensitivity of the detecting receivers has increased over the years, it has
been inadequate to keep up with the decreasing amplitude of radiated LO signals.

To conclude, I believe this to be a non-problem with equipment available to
the ordinary burgler.  While a pocket scanner might receive all of the local
oscillator frequencies used by the local police, its detection range would
likely be less than a hundred feet.

I solved a similar problem with a set of exploding security bolts.  I have
not seen these in the U.S., but I expect they are available.  They are
available in varying diameters and treads, with shear points set at the
level desired for the given application.  Detonation is accomplished by
running a fairly low voltage current of a minimum amperage determined by the
number and type of explosive shear bolts used(the electrical line activating
the detonation should have a predicted resistance, depending upon the type
of shear bolts, and whether they are wired in series or parallel: CAUTION:
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES USE A NORMAL VOM OR DVM TO CHECK LINE RESISTANCE, USE
ONLY A 'BLASTING OHM-METER') through the detonation curcuit.

In event of a compromise of electrical power to the shear bolt system, it is
customary to include a back-up power supply, the design and implimentation
of which I leave as an exercise to the student.  In practice, this sort of
emergency escape route is an escape route of 'last resort'.  You do not want
such a pathway, in extremis, to be compromised.

I might note that in the applications where I have seen such bolts used,
there has been very narrow access to the area under security, and so casual
visitors setting off the escape-route shear bolts was a non-existant problem.
In a residence, I would suggest that it might be appropriate to add a fast
(perhaps three digit?) number-pad lock on each emergency exit so armed.  I
also warn that the heads of the bolts, which contain one wire(the bolt body
providing 'ground'), should be installed in a manner to preclude tampering.
Finally, if detonation will allow explosion debris(very minimal, in most
cases) or the security grate to intrude upon property not under the owner's
control, there may be legal implications should someone be injured.  I have
no particular expertise in this area, but I can easily envision, at least
in the litigious U.S, some creatin of a felon, minus three fingers on one
hand, standing in court beside his equally mercenary American attorney,
filing for damages sufferred when your security grate blew up in his face
while the gentleman was otherwise occupied attempting to cut through one of
the shear bolts holding said security grate in place.

P.S.  Normal precautions re isolation and segmentation of the overal system
into descrete sub-units should obtain here, as one would expect.  It does
no good to have a fancy system to blow all thirty-five windows in a structure
free of security grates if a fire on the first floor burns the insulation off

I worked on one system that used answerbacks to automatically log users
in (i.e., you dialed in, the system queried for the answerback code, and
logged you in appropriately based on your answerback value).  The reason
was that TERMINALS were licensed, not USERS.  Making the user log in was
(a) worthless (since they would tape the login and password on the terminal),
(b) aggravating to the naive users, and (c) a competitive disadvantage,
since others in the same market didn't require it.

In short, that particular customer would be VERY upset if answerback
facilities were removed.

Falsifying answerbacks wasn't a big problem, since they were picked randomly
from a large universe of possible values.

Subject:  Bank card tricks in Toronto
To: SECURITY@pyrite.rutgers.edu

Here in Toronto about a year ago there was a story in the paper about
a fellow who had the technology to make bank machine cards; ie, a card
blank and a mag stripe recorder.  He looked over people's shoulders at
bank machines and memorized their access numbers, then picked up their
receipt slips which they left on top of the garbage pile or threw on
the floor.  The slips have the card number on them; that's all he
needed to make a duplicate.  Since he knew each person's access code,
you can guess the rest.

(The story detailed his conviction, by the way; someone, somehow,
convinced their bank that they weren't making these withdrawals.)

What this means is that there needs to be no extra information on the
card, just the account number (and the access code?).  I always
figured that each card itself had, essentially, its own access
code, to convice the bank that it was valid, but I guess I
overestimated the banks...

Does anyone know if the access code is, in fact, also on the mag
stripe?  I always also assumed it wasn't (oh hopeful me) but some
people claim it is.

Larry Kilgallen's note implied that DEC's sendmail as distributed
was trustworthy.  This is not the case.  DEC's Ultrix (port of 4.2 BSD)
has different bugs and different security holes from the standard
UCB distribution.  In my experience, it has not been any more or
less trustworthy than pure BSD.

Although the recent note from CERT about problems in sendmail only
referenced SunOS, the problem was in fact present in other vendors
sendmail as well (including Ultrix 3).

One of the disconcerting things about AT&T's UNIX System V, Release 4
is that it is capable of running many (most ?) BSD sources without
conversion.  One problem with portable software and standardising
OS behaviour is that something that is a problem on one machine is
also likely to be a problem on another machine.  This makes networks
more susceptible to worms and virii just as with humans when a
group is genetically homogeneous they are more susceptible to
plagues and such.  I should note here that I am a very strong supporter
of most standardisation issues and strongly believe that the combination
of POSIX efforts and the recent ANSI C standard are both very
desirable.  I just want to point out that there are mixed blessings
to it all.

In general, electronic security and trusted systems are a very subtle
business.  The more one learns, the less certain one becomes of anything.

Come, come now!  Surely you do not mean this part where you say, "I hate
people who goes around yelling about intelligence levels of any group."
Since I think I started this 'criminal intelligence' pilpul, I feel
obligated to respond to this remark.

First of all, if I was, "...yelling..." about the respective intelligence of
criminals, I did not mean to be so shrill.  As for the hate, ma yesh ma? Bad
news, so lets kill the messenger?  Absurd.

As far as DETECTED criminals being somewhat lowbrow, I believe clear
statistics demonstrate that my opinion is not just some sort of slur against
a minority(criminals), merely a statement of obvious fact.  In general, I
believe WAIS tests average out at a statistically significant measure below
the norm, and that general wealth of knowledge tends to be obviously below
normal among criminals.

Of course, my universe of discourse is restricted to DETECTED criminals.
If there exists a significant subset of criminals that are undetected, data
on them is largely unavailable, or tends to be so soft it is virtually
worthless.  I also feel obligated to exclude criminals like Lincoln
Savings and Loan's Mr. Keating, since the wealth of such people as a rule
(though not always), places them **outside** of the laws people with lesser
incomes must face.  I think it was Heinlin who wrote that anyone demanding
justice must be either very wealthy or very desperate.

Nu, any highbrow criminals out there in netland that want to address this
issue?

Re the mail vulnerability being fixed in VMS VAXmail, it was also fixed
several years earlier by the Software Tools mail, which also filtered
control characters. This fix is now ~10 years old.
   Unfortunately, answerbacks can be triggered all too easily and
have on occasion represented serious problems. We had a situation many
years ago now where someone set the answerback on one of a small
number of terminals connected to a shared VAX to
DEL *.*;*
when someone left the terminal logged in for an extended period.
   Naturally this caused consternation all around. It seemed that
in addition to control-E triggering the answerback, sometimes nulls
might do so also. (I no longer recall what terminal type this was.)
  In this case, the factor that saved the day was sufficiently
paranoid systems people: they had daily backups and could restore
the lost files. I believe that this is what is called for, rather
than appeals to finding fault with manufacturers or even than
finding fault with careless experimenters. (I know of some network
meltdowns that have clearly been due to errors while attempting
what should have been legitimate activities. The Morris case
might have been similar, as well.) Who hasn't experienced accidental
deletion of files? 
   If we are to benefit from computing, we maximize that benefit by
sharing information. It is everyone's responsibility to take
adequate care while doing so. More than ever, regular and adequate
backups are an essential part of this. This issue should be considered
before buying a computer of any type, and in any use of same. Our
VAXen are backed up regularly; my home machine and office pc's have
nothing on hard disk that isn't on floppies also. This confers
some safety. I consider the office pc a prime candidate for disaster
though, as backups are difficult enough to be rare, and disks
do crash now and then. Hopefully our next generation of appliance
computers will contain backup devices of some sort. If they do
not, it is the purchaser who is to blame for losses caused by
damage FROM WHATEVER CAUSE to that data. The same applies to shared
systems.

The new Canadian $50 note includes a small metallic patch that changes
color from gold to green, depending on the viewing angle.  I assume the
Bank of Canada (the government agency responsible for the money supply)
plans eventually to introduce these feature on smaller notes as well.

The current series of Canadian bank notes also use quite a bit of
extremely small printing that presumably cannot be copied well.  For
example, the front central portion of the note contains line after line
repeatedly saying "BANK OF CANADA 50 BANQUE DU CANADA 50" (substitute
the appropriate number in place of "50" for other denominations).  Also,
there is a large field of wavy lines in a range of pastel colors; the
lines themselves are made up of tiny "50"s (or whatever number corres-
ponds to the value of the note).

Additionally, Canadian bank notes are printed using an intaglio (raised
relief) technique -- creating a texture that can be felt on all but very
old notes, and which presumably cannot be duplicated by a copier.

Well, there ARE other techniques that work against LEXAN.  In particular
heating it up will make it bend, allowing sheets to be bent and popped from
the window frame.  They used LEXAN in the 'escape-proof' new jail in Towson,
Maryland several years ago.  Took the inmates about 3 months to figure away
to make a blowtorch from an aerosol can, point at lexan, heat for several
minutes, kick out panel.  They put bars in after that...

With suitable reinforcing, and by keeping the panes small enough, this
problem could possibly be avoided.  An interesting possibility is making
those 'colonial' style windows where the panes are about 8 inches by 12
inches, with the panes being Lexan and the normally wood barriers between
pains being made instead from steel would probably work nicely, without
even having the 'look' of security, if that's what you want.

it harder by XOR'ing all the strings in the entire binary.

  Yes, it was POSSIBLE to reverse engineer from the binary to the source

This works.  As a former bank teller at a commercial bank in Buffalo, I recall
a teller actually taking one.  If you must pass them off, though, don't do it
at a bank - they're much to careful, and know enough to look at the *portrait*

Yes, well...um-- mutiliated currency must have one side intact (if I recall
the rules correctly).  Hence it is necessary to do this dastardly deed with
*two* 20's, using first one side on the first bill, and the opposite side on
the other.

Me neither.  The FBI and the Treasury department do not take kindly

I read in the Boston Globe recently that the U.S. Treasury puts small
red and blue threads in its paper money.  The item mentioned the paper is
so difficult to make, that many counterfeiters bleach small denominations 
and re-print larger denominations onto the bleached bills.

I took out a one dollar bill and sure enough there were tiny little red and
blue threads.  They were easiest to see around the edge where there was no
printing.

Maybe they shouldn't put those threads in the ones and fives! (need I explain

Subject: WARNING -- change in how "security" is delivered 
To: security

I have changed my remailing method slightly, such that the return-path is
"/dev/null@localhost" instead of "security@pyrite.rutgers.edu".  Note that if
your mailer reads the return-path: header [as it should] when you reply to a
message, you will lose, so you may have to explicitly send to the list address
or who you intended to reply to.  This is actually a good thing, since simply
"replying" would sometimes send your reply to the incoming list feed instead of
the sender.  Then I'd get the message and wouldn't be able to tell where you
wanted to put it.  I get many of these, i.e. messages that look like the
person was trying to reply to a sender and wound up sending it to the list.  I
will grant you that this "unixish" syntax may not do the right thing on all
kinds of hosts, but it will still generate an invalid address and die where it
stands under any mailer that tries to return errors to return-path:.  Some
mailers return to Sender: which is also present; this I can't do much about.

This is in a weak attempt to reduce the large number of mailer failures I
get back every day.  It is very rare that all the addresses on the list
actually work at the same time -- there's always one losing host out there
someplace that ate its aliases file or can't find another machine farther
down the line.  This should make the errors die at the source.  I will
periodically send a message with the "real" return-path, just so I can update
my list and make sure things are still working.

This should also help me unload this perpetual backlog.  One thing that delays
resending is wading through all these mail failures and trying to deal with
them before I send out more messages.  I really wish people would keep their
mailers in better operating condition!

------

Report on the 16th Annual Security Conference held in November, 1989

Dear Dasig Subscribers,

	Last November I attended a security conference in Atlanta, GA.  It
was an unusually good event; well-organized, many options for workshops and
presentations, and terrific for 'networking' - meeting people from higher
ed & the corporate world.  As a relative newcomer to the security world I
say: If you need to go to a security conference attend the next one of
these!

	The presenters throughout the week were equally divided between
vendors/consultants and non-vendors/consultants.  Sales pitches were
confined to the exhibition area and not sprinkled through the day.  In
other words, the presentations were not used as platforms for advocating
particular technologies or services.

	Favorite sessions included:
	Keynote Addresses -
		- Legal Liability of Corp Officers
		- FBI Viewpoint (Bill Sessions, Director)
		- Ethical Considerations (R. Barker, Cornell's Provost)
	Other presentations/workshops -
		- How To Gain Sr. Mgmt Support for a Sec. Program
		- How To Be an Effective Security Officer
		- Anticipating Future Network Sec. Reqs. and Abuses

	The exhibits were almost all worth a visit, and ranged form
disaster recovery (a melted, blackened VAX hissed & spewed 'smoke') to
create-your-own security awareness videos.

	There were optional ($250 each) full-day sessions the Sunday before
and the Thursday following the conference.

	As there were 8-10 concurrent sessions running every hour & 1/2,
and due to the conference organizers not making ALL the session handouts
avaiable, I spent the first two days meeting poepl and making deals to get
the handouts for the presentations I wasn't attending (you send me yours &
I'll send you mine).  The organizers did give out several handouts on
diskette & said they planned to eventually be able to give out all the
handouts this way.

	Next conference?
	Atlanta 11/12-11/15/90
	Sponsored by: Computer Security Inst.
	Phone: (508) 393-2600
	Cost: $1,295

	I am planning a presentation at this next conference, tentatively
about creating an info & computer security policy & program in a
decentralized environment...from ground zero.

	I'll be sending around a list of attendees from the 89' conference
who came from institutes of higher education.

From: "Frank Topper" <topper%a1.relay@upenn.edu>
Subject: Meeting with the FBI
To: security@ohstvma.bitnet, dasig@suvm.bitnet

Dear Security & Dasig Subscribers,

	Activated by a suggestion from William Sessions, Director of the
FBI, my associate Linda May and I scheduled a meeting with the local
Philadelphia office to discuss computer, information and network security.
We wanted to draw from their experience, learn their perspective, and
establish a direct conection with the poeple who can help us in the event
of an important security breach -- and to know what they can and can not do
regarding the subsequent investigation.

	We met with two agents last month.

	Our agenda included discussing security breaches (principal kinds
reported, principal deficiencies that enable such breaches, proportion
involving perpetrators external/internal to the organization, proportion of
organizations which had a security plan, program and officer, and the most
important factor(s) for achieving appropriate levels of security),
classifications of activities (legal, illegal and questionable), recaps of
proposed legislation, and suggested actions & publications.

	Regarding breaches:
	They said that banks are the most susceptible to loss, and that
most private companies absord losses without prosecuting due to the time,
expense, and the wish to not appear stupid.  They said that companies that
did prosecute breaches had fewer recurring problems.

	Universities tend to get more young hacker-types, while
corporations get embezzlers.  Most complaints are financial institutes that
get 'hit over the wire' (wire fraud), bulletin boards containing pirated
software & credit card access numbers, and, most recently, they are
beginning to get calls about virus problems.

	Although they were not allowed to give details, the FBI is
currently involved in two major virus investigations.

	They see a major problem being when a hacker receives 'celebrity
status'.  This encourages trying to beat the system since fame and not
disrepute is the potential payoff.

	Statistically, lower-level employees are easier to catch because
they leave a trail of their actions.  Higher-level (V.P.) employees know
the systems and leave less of a trail.

	Activity types:
	The FBI gets involved when a Federal crime is committed. Usually
this means either: 1)Crime involving more than one state, 2) crimes
involving gov't computers or gov't networks, or 3) the more broad 86'
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.  Interestingly enough, one of the agents we
spoke with participated in the investigation which has lead to the
conviction of Robert Morris, Jr.

	A questionable activity, but not illegal, is when a hacker (or
employee) reads files they are not supposed to have seen.  Not so related
to universities is the new wrinkle provided by cellular phones.  In this
case the transmission travels through the airwaves to a hardwire
transmission point.  It is not illegal to listen in to the part broadcasted
(although, a recent note on the SECURITY list mentioned that it was illegal
to disclose an overheard conversation).

	Anytime we have a question about an activity we are encourages to
contact the agents & get the latest perspective.  Legislation-wise, neither
agent has received updates on the two 89' proposed acts: Computer
Protection & Computer Virus Eradication.  They said there is always a lag
time between when a law is passed and when they get instructions as to what
it means and how it can be used.  They can prosecute computer crimes now
involving threatsor harassment....and they said if they REALLY WANT to get
someone they'll research any and all laws to try to find something to stick
on the alleged criminal.

	They suggest knowing what data is sensitive and take extra
precautions.  Whatever security programs are running need to be monitored
and checked for patterns of unusual activity, i.e., send reports to the
user/custodians of each protected system.

	Lastly, to get around the undesirable impression of security being
iron-handed, they stressed the ned for an education program touching every
employee with a solid emphasis on WHY the security efforts (and the
employyees' efforts) are needed...and what can happen if the efforts are
not made.

	Based on an "OK" form the local agent-in-charge, both agents were
willing to come to this university and speak to our planned-for Security
Steering Committee, and without making specific recommendations, stress the
importance of having a full-time security officer-type and comprehensive
education/awareness program.

     I presume that car stereos are the most stolen item in the universe.
You think the stereo manufacturers take this into account when they
project sales into the future?  Does a stolen stereo mean another sale?
Does it mean a lost sale to the bozo who buys the hot stereo?
Does it mean a lost sale to those of us who are too scared to have

Actually, the idea of putting a hologram on a bill is what American
Banknote Inc. has staked its livelyhood on.  That is the company that
makes the holograms that have become standard on credit cards.

But its all a hoax.  Here's why:

First, anybody can make a hologram, even the small foil kind that are
embossed.  Totall equipment cost is no more than $10,000.  That's
hardly a deterrent.

Second, nobody checks the holograms.  Ever notice how different cards
use different holograms?  They could have done something trickly, like
storing information in the hologram that would have required a special
reader.  But that would have been too expensive.

Indeed, the only reason that there are holograms on credit cards ---
and the reason they are coming to currency --- is that American
Banknote Inc. has succeded in making people think that it is more secure.

It isn't.

Well, I'm glad to see I started a conversation that got some response anyway.

My friends motorcycle (Honda) had such high tolorences in the cyclinder and
pin assembly that the core could be turn with a screwdriver if you took a little
time to play with it and jiggle it into line.  If your worried about it,
don't make your car a target, most cars in my area anyway are usally first
taken for goodies inside (tronics), then end up stripped.  It seems if they are
going to go through all the trouble to rip off your stuff, they are going to
get the most out of it.

Pullout stereos, amplifiers in the trunk out of sight and a blinking LED are
all good ideas.  Even if the LED doen't really go to an alarm, it'll keep
alot of lesser hand prints off the car, and with a simple IC LED Flasher, a
single "D" cell can drive it continously for a year.

At all costs, avoid parking on the street, cars are rarely taken out of the 
driveway.  Usally they are taken out of parking lots (around here Apartment
building lots) or off the street.  The best thing (without having a garage)
is to park under a motion detector/flood light assembly.  The action of having
the dark driveway flooded with that 300 watt quartz halogen lamp gets attention,
and I think is more effective than simply having the area continously lit.

Some basic ideas, always, even for a minute, lock the doors with the windows
up.  Many cars have been boosted when someone runs into the 7-11 "just for a
minute."  Roll the windows up tight, most manual windows when rolled tight
will track outwards on most newer cars, making the user of a slimjim (many
new cars still don't use the simple barrier plates and sidebars) have a rough
time even getting it inserted, much les[s using it, as well as making wires and
such very difficult to use to get to the locks.

If anyone really wants your car, they are going to get at it, but you don't
have to help them.

Last time I was in Belfast I rented a car at the airport (I think it was
Hertz).  They car's didn't use regular keys but something that looked, well,
I can't describe it other than to say the key was very strangely shaped.
The reason they go to such trouble with locks is the IRA (and maybe the
provos (I can't recall)) steal cars and put bombs in them and then park them
somewhere.  The security forces will assume any abandoned/stolen car has a
bomb in it--we all know how you defuse a bomb, you blow it up.  So, if any
car is stolen it is effectively totalled.  I suspect it is hard to get the
damn things insured.  Hence the extra security.

I never could find out who made the locks.

that it was actually working.  A verbose queue run tells me that mail is
still being delivered with an envelope address of "security", however,
so this isn't the correct method.  I've been informed that "correct" mailers
*will* reply to the From: field, but there are a lot of different mailers
out there, many of them incorrect, that will send replies to all kinds of
different places.  I have no control over these other than yelling at
postmasters, and you have NO IDEA how heartily sick of yelling at postmasters
I have become over the years.  Often enough there isn't even a "postmaster"
address at some sites, and I don't have to re-read RFC822 et al to know that
THAT is a bozo no-no.  If your mailer deals with the From: field then fine,
if it doesn't then you stand to lose unless you explicitly mail to the
sender.  It all depends on your site.

The fact remains that most mailers try to return errors to the *envelope*
address.  Over the next few days I will be playing with various configurations
until I find something that works, so if you see some odd-looking errors you'll

I didn't mean for this to turn into a mailer flame, which has nothing to do

Greetings,

I am building a package for use in the war against "System Crackers",
it will probably be released in the next few months, I'm aiming at
spring, early summer. It will be available to all, though due to its
nature, I will have to set something special up so only ligitimate
sites end up with it; Ideas on the lowest overhead way to do this
would be welcome.

If you have a favorite hack you have written to use for this purpose,
and would like to offer it to the world for people to use in this fight,
please contact me directly so I may include it. Ideas and comments are
also welcome.

				Thanks in advance,

Does anybody sell decent locks made for car doors?  Could I just throw away my
junky original-equipment locks and replace them with good ones?  Think it might
make a difference if I write to Consumer Reports detailing how and *why* it
should be done?  How about my insurance company?

Of course, locks aren't the only part of the problem:  they need something
stronger than sheet metal to hold them.  I can't count the number of cars I've
seen with missing trunk locks.  Most car doors are still vulnerable to
slim-jims.  And the windows are still made of fragile glass....

I would be uneasy about money with machine readable serial numbers. Just
think how easy it would be for the government to track how you spend your
money.  For those of you saying "oh sure", I would like to point out that
credit card companies sell mailing lists based on total debt, size of
monthly payments, whether you pay your bill on time every month, what
you buy, how much you make, etc.  Every time you use a credit card the
information is saved away.

And it is surprisingly easy to get access to that information.  A Business
Week reporter registered for a credit bureau service (like TRW) and got a
copy of Dan Quayle's credit history.  Danny was not pleased when BW called
him for his reaction.

Something like 300 BILLION dollars in paper currency is missing from the
money supply.  A great deal of it is in eastern Europe and in the hands
of drug lords (they do keep some in cash).  Just imagine what would happen
if the US government said "ok, new currency time; everyone turn in the old.
Old currency will only be legal for 5 years."  Take a real bite out of crime.

Welcome Banners

I recently got a DDN security bulletin (# 90-04) that mentioned that one
should make sure any computer welcome banners did not contain the word
"Welcome."  (The default message on some machines is to have the banner
be "Welcome to [nodename].")  In a recent court case, a judge threw out
a case against a hacker because (he ruled) the message "Welcome to ..."
was a clear invitation to everyone..  The bulletin also suggested that
the banners not contain system information (e.g., "VAX/VMS 5.2 on VAX
11/780"), as this can be useful to hackers; it should also not contain
the words "for official use only," because it seems that to hackers, this
message means it *must* be defense (or at least evil-government) related,
and therefore attracts them in droves.

For picking purposed, I'd consider the medeco to be more secure (even moreso
for their biaxial line, which actually may be the default by now).  I don't
expect that your average burglar would generally attempt to pick a medeco.
You also have the security that more people know of medeco locks as being
"high security locks" and may just avoid the lock.  

In terms of vandalism, I'd still go with medeco.  Medeco's have hardened 
steel rods inserted in strategic places so as to make drilling difficult,
so the brute force method won't easily work.  Also, the keyways are more
warded then the Kaba/Keso (which I have always seen as beening totally 
unwarded) so it is far less likely that they will be able to wedge a 
piece of metal stock into the core just to annoy you.

the caveat of it all is that if the burglar wants in badly enough, (s)he'll
get in.  If they want to vandaize, they will.  All security systems have
their own weaknesses.  Some just aren't as easy to exploit as others.

Here in Switzerland, virtually every door is locked with a KESO style
lock, (I have seen one Medeco cylinder in use here, it was on a shop
door).  Locksmiths here know which blanks of Keso they're not supposed
to duplicate, (always the ones that are used for entrance doors).

Having seen a vandalized Medeco cylinder, I would guess that Keso is
better that way.  The keyway is somewhat narrower.  Against a really
determined vandal however, all key locks suffer from the 'fill up the
keyway with Araldite (the local epoxy glue)' technique.  I don't really
know how to defend against this effectively.  Also note that it can be
difficult in some Keso installations to remove the cylinder if you can't
insert a key!.

What are your concerns?  Pick resistance - all are fairly good; I'd
probably give the Medeco an edge, since I believe (although I'm not
certain) that the Keso / Kaba rely on having lots of pins and don't
add anything else to prevent picking, while the Medeco has a sidebar.

Physical security - Medeco cylinders have hardened steel inserts to
prevent drilling the pins or the sidebar.  Don't know about the others.

Key duplication - lots of hardware stores have Medeco key machines; you
probably have to go to a locksmith to get the Keso or Kaba key duplicated.
If you're concerned about someone borrowing the key and duplicating it,
then making unauthorized use at another time, and you want to go Medeco,
you can get a cylinder using a restricted blank.  Copies are only
available by mail with an authorized signature.

If you don't want to frustrate a burglar, don't bother with a lock at
all!  :-)

A healthy application of epoxy will screw up any of the locks equally
well.  If you're worried about that, then the physical security of the
Medeco might be a drawback.  (Harder for you to drill out if necessary.)
A good combination lock will avoid the problems of a keyhole that can be
blocked.  For that matter, a magnetic lock also has an advantage - if the
keyhole is blocked, you can simply drill & file it out without worrying
about damaging pins.  Miwa (sp?) makes cylinders that operate with a
magnetic key.

Two questions:

1) In institutions which have frequent room rotations, as in the
   dormitories of a University, what kinds of policies have been
   implemented to keep the rooms secure from year to year at your
   institution?  Cylinder rotations can be complicated and costly
   (institutional politics) if done on a yearly basis but without
   such actions it would seem that the new residents relatively
   unsafe.

2) Does anyone have an automated (no security people watching over
   constantly) and *secure* building entrance system (or have you
   seen any) in your living area (again, this is primarily focused
   at the dormitory setting)?  I've seen where all the buildings are
   locked and students are given the building key, but this policy
   is but a show to look good for parents; in most cases a stranger
   can simply wait for a key holder to gain entrance and call out
   to "hold the door for one sec!."

As some quick background, the reason for my questions (many thanks
to those who responded to my request for information on integrated
Card Systems!) is that the University of Buffalo has been selected
as the site for the 1993 World Universiad (University Olympic Games)
and is actively investigating new methods of securing the dorm area
which will serve many of the athletes (if not all) (not that current
methods are faulty.. only that additional/alternate methods are being
considered).

OK, I confess: I am not picking up the LO from the hand-helds. The signal

I don't know a suitable metric for this.  (I know it's easy, though
tedious, for me.)  However, some indication can be gained by observing
that certainly hundreds, possibly thousands, of "crackers" routinely
disassemble copy-protected applications in order to understand the (often
deliberately convoluted) code well enough to strip off copy protection.
Don Lancaster explained several of the tricks of the trade in one of his
Apple II enhancement books.

> I'd say it takes more "reverse-engineering" than most system
> administrators have the knowledge, time or desire to put into it.

Judging by "The Cuckoo's Egg" and personal experience, I'd say that
most system administrators aren't very competent, period.  I certainly
wouldn't ask one of them to disassemble object code; there are many
other people with skill in that area who would be a better choice.

To give you a small taste of what is involved, let's consider a binary
executable image (without symbol table, to make it harder) from, say, a
PDP-11 UNIX system and some of the initial steps one might take to
disassemble it.

1.  Devise plausible environmental hypotheses, which can be checked and
revised as the work proceeds.  E.g. probably the source language was C
and the standard C library was linked into the image after all the
application-specific object code.

2.  Print out a dump of the code.  If it's UNIX, you can tell code from
data because they're in different load segments that are clearly
spelled out by a small initial header attached to the load image.
If you can't figure out where the code is, dump it all as instructions
as well as hex words and characters; clear character strings must be
data (as well as important operational clues), and gobbledegook
instruction sequences must be either data or correct instructions
decoded with the wrong starting offset (with variable-length instructions
it will converge to correct synchronization within a few instructions).

3.  Mark subroutine boundaries.  These are easy to spot by their
characteristic instructions.  Also mark (in a different color)
subroutine calls.

4.  Using knowledge of how the compiler generates code, identify
automatic variables, statics, etc. used within a given function as
guidelines in decoding it.  E.g. registers 0&1 are temporaries,
2-5 are used for "register" autos, and 6&7 are reserved for SP and PC.
You can generally recognize when a long int is being accessed from
the characteristic code, and similarly for other situations.

5.  Figure out what some of the small subroutines do, give them
meaningful names (e.g. ring_bell()), and write these labels beside
all calls to them.

6.  Now iterate to somewhat larger functions that use several of the
smaller ones you've already decoded and assigned names.  As you figure
them out treat them as in step 5 and iterate with yet larger functions.

7.  Occasionally, it can be useful to extract the instructions for
some mysterious function into a genuine assembly-language or even C
source file, assemble it, and call it from a test program you write to
explore the behavior of the function in question.

8.  Persistence is rewarded.

"The National Security Archive is an innovative non-profit research
institute and library facility which serves scholars, journalists, congress,
present and former policy makers, public interest organizations and the
american public by making available the internal government documentation
that is indispensable for reasearch and informed public debate on foreign,
intelligence, defense and international economic policy."
They get their info from unclassified govt documents, congressional
testimony, court records, presidential libraries, FOIA battles and other
sources.  They publish their documents and indices on microform which they
distribute to libraries for a fee.
This is where dangerous kooks who would question the wisdom of our national

Many people have the misconception (largely propagated by the media) that
safes can be opened by people using sensitive stethescopes.  However, by
and large no competent professional safecracker relies on sound.  Instead,
at least at the "agency" school, they teach students to rely on developing
a sensitive touch.  Many safes (particularly old crakerjack boxes) are not
built to particularly tight tolerances.  As a consequence, you can simply
feel the tumblers behind the dial when them impact each other.  By turning
the dial back and forth (let's not get too specific here) one can build up
a chart of where the tumblers impact each other and where the indentation
for the locking mechanism exists on each wheel.  More modern "spy proof" &
"manipulation proof" locks resist such penetration attempts.  However, if
you have a reasonably long period of time just about any safe can be opened.

A thermal lance is typically a hollow fuel rod with a high pressure oxygen
source in the center (2000-4000 psi gas tank) used to usually used to burn
through the exterior of a safe.  Unfortunately, they are very messy, loud,
emit a lot of light, and often burn up the contents of the safe.  You would
most often be better off getting inside knowledge about where to drill the
safe door, set up a jig with some low speed high torque drill and a set of
cobalt drill bits.  By the way, beware of alarm sensors and tear gas bottles
that may be hidden inside the door of the safe.

Apart from military operations, no one is fool enough to try to "blow" a
safe these days.  However, if you're in a hurry, spend a little time to
learn how to make shaped cutting charges to slice through the bolts in
the door of the safe.  Plastique will do the job in a pinch ... but some
time spend casting more uniform charges with metal liners will reduce the
amount of explosive and consequent mess to clean up.

If you want to do it right check out some old "It Takes A Thief" and the
more recent "Die Hard" movies.  They both illustrate appropriate methods
for opening the most resistant safes.

One final note:  It is often easier to go through the walls of a safe or a

is often missed by the amateur who takes the challenge of opening the safe
head on.

To: misc-security@uunet.uu.net

>Exactly what is a thermal lance? 

     It's a cutting torch that burns steel as fuel.  A simple form is seven
steel rods arranged in a hexagonal array inside a steel tube.  Oxygen is
pumped in one end of the tube and the other end is ignited, usually by
first lighting a wood block, which will burn nicely in oxygen, and using
it to ignite the steel.  One of these will cut through a railroad rail in
a few tens of seconds.

     There are several major drawbacks to the thermal lance.  The type of
steel used is critical, and there are hazards if a poor type is chosen.
The amount of oxygen used is very high; you tend to need many cylinders
to get any real work done.  The lance itself is consumed rapidly, so you need 
plenty of lance sections.  This makes it a very expensive tool to use.
It's not used much by criminals, since the amount of equipment you have to
bring along is high.  Typical uses include clearing railroad wrecks.

 Government "bashing" statements like this are unsupported in fact,

intrusion was definately questionable, but in our current society,
government respects individual rights.  The courts support
the government in "eavesdropping" cases - surveillance, that is -
because given probable cause, it is absolutely permittable, and I
would argue the *responsibility* of the government to take
advantage of the technological resources they control in order
to conduct an investigation and bring criminals to justice.
 There is no question that power of this kind must be checked to
avoid a "Big Brother" society, and it is checked - by other branches
of government (I hope we all remember this from Elementary School).
To make unfounded accusations against our government is in effect
condemning our entire system.

   I've never seen any claims by DEC, Sun, or more to the point, UCB that
   their UNIX-based operating systems were secure; have you?  What is the
   point of making innocent manufacturers responsible for some person's
   malicious abuse of their products?

I am sorry, but I just do not agree with you.  While I could accept the fact
that UCB is a research institution providing a warrantless service to a
community, Sun and DEC do not fall into that category.  They are commercial
institutions selling a service to the same community.  They are not completely
innocent by any stretch of the imagination.

Oh, they might argue they make no claims as to the suitability of their
product for any particular purpose, but distributing a product with DEBUG
enabled demonstrates a blatant lack of concern for the community in which they
sell their services.  They should be held accountable.

I do not believe this has anything to do with being secure.  It is a question
of good programming practices and acceptable software distribution
practices.

And just to be fair, almost every hardware and software vendor today is guilty
of the same crime.  I only wish the justice system would see it that way.

We can go back and forth about whether or not they should have noticed the
DEBUG option being set, but, if I were Robert Morris, and really did not have
any bad intentions (but then again with our legal system it doesn't really
matter), I would have immediately counter sued Sun and DEC.  Wishful thinking
suggests every one who was infected by the problem should join the cause.

Sun frequently implies that SunOS 4.x is a C2 system, but then in the
security features guide mentions that they never actually had it evaluated
by the NCSC.  After the Morris' worm, DEC made a great deal of the fact 
that Ultrix had been more "secure" than other vendors.  A more accurate

so that it can't do much of what other BSD systems can.

Relevant building codes here require at least one window in every bedroom
to have a hinged set of bars that can be unlocked inside the room so they
swing away from the window, allowing exit in an emergency.  The locking

Removable-core systems make this relatively easy and inexpensive.
In fact you can just permute the cores, no need to re-pin them.
Best of all (no pun intended) is if the cores are not stamped on

the only way someone could use an old copy of a key is to try it

At the moment security on the internet and other systems are pretty pitiful.

As one person stated, when you log on a system, and it says the version, 
nodename etc, it helps the hacker in many ways.  Example, on UNIX, BSD
(some of them) have bugs in the UUCP area, where you can call a system
up, run uucico and download the password file.  On the system V's you 
cannot do this.  

Also, a lot of users have the same password as there name (ie: mike, mike-
john, john- steve, steve).  On various UNIX systems, you can run the 'who'
process at the login prompt.  If a hacker does this, he can see all the user
names that are logged on and then attempt to hack the passwords.  

In my opinion, system administraters should start cracking down on the
security field.  Right now there are too many SA's saying "Naaaah, it could
never happen to my system, they only break into Military computers".

I tend to disagree with this theory.  All a crook has to do to see if the

However, I like my alarm on my car.  It has a bunch of inputs for door pin
switches, shock detectors, etc.  I run a splice from each of these inputs to
a programmable voice siren driver (which has 4 inputs...), and have a
different recorded message for each input.  Door pins get "Hey....you just
opened my door...did you slim jim it?", shock detectors get "Hey quick
rocking/smacking my car...", tow detector says "QUIT TOWING MY CAR AWAY!!!",
and glass breakage detector gets "Hey, you just smashed my window...".

I got the prog. voice driver from work for about $45-$50.00 and they got it
from Oregon Scientific....

The news articles I saw indicated that he was simply exploiting the
same well-known security loopholes that the Morris worm had used,
and copying /etc/passwd to a more convenient system where he'd run
a dictionary-based /etc/passwd cracker on it in order to obtain user
accounts and passwords for various systems.  Nothing new and no
point to his activity.  One report said "an Australian named Dave"
claimed to be responsible, and that he was reacting to Stoll's
unfavorable evaluation of such so-called "hacking" in "The Cuckoo's
Egg".  Seems childish to me.  In any case, it's not worthy of the
name "superhacker".  In fact, he might be using a security sweep
tool that BRL developed to spot exactly these security flaws.  (We
made it available to some system administrators upon request.)
There has been far more than enough time for system administrators
to repair these well-known security flaws (or at least to get their
system vendors to repair them), if they had cared to do so.  If you
read "The Cuckoo's Egg" you should appreciate that incompetent
system administration is the main reason that security loopholes
persist.  And a low sense of ethics is the main reason they are
exploited.

Subject: Clearing a building nightly
To: security-request@rutgers.edu

My company has just moved into a new facility, equipped with a security system
that we turn on at night.  The problem is, how do we make sure everyone is
out of the building before turning it on?  The current thinking is that if
anyone is working past 7 PM they go to the lobby and sign in, then the last
person to leave turns on the alarm.  However, when deadlines approach
people tend to get so involved in the current problem that several times they'll
look up and say "dang, it's 9:00.  I better sign in!".  Needless to say if
the alarm was already turned on then the cops, and our security officer get
called.  This is embarressing to say the least.  It happened last week (not
to me).

So we need to know how to ensure the building is empty before turning the
system on.  This silly building is layed out like a maze, thus a security
guard making a quick check stands a very good chance of missing an employee
visiting the litterbox.  We don't have a paging system and have no intention
of getting one.  We talked about installing buzzers throughout the building
to warn late workers to go sign in but this is very expensive.

I'm sure several other companies have been faced with this problem.  Any
ideas on what to do would be appreciated.

Someone posted a comparision of crime rates between Europe and the

rates were much higher than the U.S.  (Makes no sense to me either,
but that may explain why the Europeans put so much energy into

Recalling currency isn't without precedent.  In the last century,
the treasury replaced all of one denomination because of ONE

Of course, our bills used to be Hollerith-card sized, and were

  The CERT has already put out an advisory (CA-90:02, March 19, 1990,
"Internet Intruder Warning") detailing the actions of this hacker.  I
wouldn't call him a "superhacker"; he isn't doing anything incredibly
new or different, he's just using the already-known security holes that
so many systems haven't even bothered to fix, even after Morris' worm.

  There was a story about this guy in the New York Times a couple weeks
ago, apparently because someone claiming to be the hacker called them up
(I can't remember the details incredibly clearly, but I seem to recall
that he identified himself as "Dave".) and started describing details of
the systems that had been breached that supposedly only the person who
did the breaching would know.

  Apparently, one of the system he broke into was one of Cliff Stoll's
machines, and he broke root and changed the motd to read, "Tell Cliff to
read his mail -- the Cuckoo has egg on his face," or something like that.

  CERT advisories, including this one, are available for anonymous ftp
from cert.sei.cmu.edu (128.237.253.5).  I don't have anything to do with

Police Smash Computer-Hacking Operation

	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Federal police today smashed a
computer-hacking ring and arrested three young men following
complaints from the FBI about illegal intrusions into university
computer systems in the United States.
	   The three were charged in Melbourne Court with damaging data in
government computers, which is punishable with a maximum of 10
years in jail. Their identities were not made available but police
said they ranged in age from 18 to 21.
	   A police spokesman said the suspects were arrested following
raids earlier in the day in which computers were put out of action
to prevent the destruction of software.
	   The arrests followed a six-month investigation conducted jointly
by Australian federal police, the FBI and police in the state of
Victoria.
	   Federal police alleged the three hackers _ using the codenames
Phoenix, Electron and Nom _ hacked into universities and
laboratories in Australia and overseas.
	   Police said it was the biggest Australian-based computer hacking
operation uncovered so far.
	   U.S. investigators first discovered an Australian-based hacker
was at work in 1988 when it was found the Citibank system had been
illegally entered. Further reports of extensive illegal entry to
U.S. computers followed throughout last year.
	   A Federal Police spokesman said their investigation began in
earnest only six months ago after the Commonwealth Crimes Act was
approved last July covering offenses on illegal computer use.

   ACM Committee on Computers and Public Policy, Peter G. Neumann, moderator

SELF-PROCLAIMED `HACKER' SENDS MESSAGE TO CRITICS
By JOHN MARKOFF, c.1990 N.Y. Times News Service

   A man identifying himself as the intruder who illegally penetrated part of a
nationwide computer linkup said Tuesday that he had done so to taunt computer
security specialists who have denounced activities like his.  His assertion
came in a telephone call to The New York Times on Tuesday afternoon.  The man
identified himself only as an Australian named Dave, and his account could not
be confirmed.  But he offered a multitude of details about various electronic
break-ins in recent months that were corroborated by several targets of the
intruder.  He said he was calling from outside the United States, but that
could not be verified.
   Federal investigators have said that in recent months the intruder has
illegally entered computers at dozens of institutions in a nationwide network,
the Internet.  Once inside the computers, they said, the intruder stole lists
of the passwords that allow users to enter the system and then erased files to
conceal himself.   [...]
   Investigators in the new Internet case said the federal authorities in
Chicago were close to finding the intruder and several associates.  The U.S.
attorney's office in Chicago refused to confirm that assertion.  The
investigators said that in some cases the intruder might have used a program
that scanned the network for computers that were vulnerable.
   In his telephone call to The Times on Tuesday, the man said he had broad
access to U.S. computer systems because of security flaws in those machines.
As a self-proclaimed computer hacker, he said, he decided to break in to the
computer security experts' systems as a challenge.  Among the targets of the
recent attacks were Clifford Stoll, a computer system manager at the
Smithsonian Astronomical Observatory at Harvard University, and Eugene
Spafford, a computer scientist who specializes in computer security issues at
Purdue University.  The caller said he was upset by Stoll's portrayal of
intruders in a new book, ``The Cuckoo's Egg.''  ``I was angry at his
description of a lot of people,'' the caller said.  ``He was going on about how
he hates all hackers, and he gave pretty much of a one-sided view of who
hackers are.''
   Several days ago the intruder illegally entered a computer Stoll manages at
Harvard University and changed a standard welcome message to read: ``Have Cliff
read his mail. The cuckoo has egg on his face. Anonymous.''  The caller
explained in detail his techniques for illegally entering computer systems.  He
gave information about Stoll's and Spafford's computer systems that matched
details they were familiar with.
   And he described a break-in at an external computer that links different
networks at Digital Equipment Corp.  A spokeswoman for the company confirmed
that a machine had been entered in the manner the caller described.  But the
caller was not able to penetrate more secure Digital computers, she said.
   The caller said he had intended to tease the security experts but not to
damage the systems he entered.  ``It used to be the security guys chase the
hackers,'' he said. ``Now it's the hackers chase the security people.''
   Several managers of computer systems that were entered said that no
significant harm had been done but that the invader had wasted the time of
system administrators, who were forced to drop their normal duties to deal with
the breaches in security.
   Ordinary users were also inconvenienced, the managers said, because their
computers had to be temporarily removed from the system for security reasons.
   Investigators familiar with the break-ins said the intruder had entered
systems by using several well-known security flaws that have been widely
distributed in computerized mailing lists
circulated among systems managers.
   Stoll, who from 1986 to 1988 tracked a group of West Germans breaking into
U.S. corporate, university and nonclassified military computers, said the
intruders had not proved any point.  ``It's sad that people have these
gunslinger ethics,'' he said.  ``It shows how easy it is to break into even a
modestly secure system.''  Spafford, who has also written <garbled>, but added
that nothing significant had been compromised.  [...]
   As a result of the break-ins, the Smithsonian Astronomical disconnected its
computers from the Internet, a network that connects severs around the world.
   Among the institutions believed to have been penetrated by the intruder are
the Los Alamos National Laboratory, Harvard, Digital Equipment, Livermore
Laboratories, Boston University and the University of Texas.
   Tuesday, the caller asserted that he had successfully entered dozens of
different computers by copying the password files to his machine and then
running a special program to decode the files.  That program was originally
written as a computer security experiment by a California-based computer
scientist and then distributed to other scientists.  [... reference to the
following CERT message...]
   Asked Tuesday whether he would continue his illegal activities, the caller
said he might lay low for a while.  ``It's getting a bit hot,'' he said, ``and
we went a bit berserk in the past week.''

------------------------------

CA-90:02
			    CERT Advisory
			    March 19, 1990
		      Internet Intruder Warning

There have been a number of media reports stemming from a March 19 New York
Times article entitled 'Computer System Intruder Plucks Passwords and
Avoids Detection.'  The article referred to a program that attempts to
get into computers around the Internet.

At this point, the Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center
(CERT/CC) does not have hard evidence that there is such a program.  What we
have seen are several persistent attempts on systems using known security
vulnerabilities.  All of these vulnerabilities have been previously reported.
Some national news agencies have referred to a 'virus' on the Internet; the
information we have now indicates that this is NOT true.  What we have seen and
can confirm is an intruder making persistent attempts to get into Internet
systems.

It is possible that a program may be discovered.  However, all the techniques
used in these attempts have also been used, in the past, by intruders probing
systems manually.

As of the morning of March 19, we know of several systems that have been broken
into and several dozen more attempts made on Thursday and Friday, March 15 and
16.

Systems administrators should be aware that many systems around the Internet
may have these vulnerabilities, and intruders know how to exploit them.  To
avoid security breaches in the future, we recommend that all system
administrators check for the kinds of problems noted in this message.

The rest of this advisory describes problems with system configurations that we
have seen intruders using.  In particular, the intruders attempted to exploit
problems in Berkeley BSD derived UNIX systems and have attacked DEC VMS
systems.  In the advisory below, points 1 through 12 deal with Unix, points 13
and 14 deal with the VMS attacks.

If you have questions about a particular problem, please get in touch with your
vendor.

The CERT makes copies of past advisories available via anonymous FTP (see the
end of this message).  Administrators may wish to review these as well.

We've had reports of intruders attempting to exploit the following areas:

1) Use TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) to steal password files.  

   To test your system for this vulnerability, connect to your system using
TFTP and try 'get /etc/motd'.  If you can do this, anyone else can get your
password file as well.  To avoid this problem, disable tftpd.

   In conjunction with this, encourage your users to choose passwords that are
difficult to guess (e.g. words that are not contained in any dictionary of
words of any language; no proper nouns, including names of "famous" real or
imaginary characters; no acronyms that are common to computer professionals; no
simple variations of first or last names, etc.)  Furthermore, inform your users
not to leave any clear text username/password information in files on any
system.

   If an intruder can get a password file, he/she will usually take it to
another machine and run password guessing programs on it. These programs
involve large dictionary searches and run quickly even on slow machines.  The
experience of many sites is that most systems that do not put any controls on
the types of passwords used probably have at least one password that can be
guessed.

2) Exploit accounts without passwords or known passwords (accounts with vendor
supplied default passwords are favorites).  Also uses finger to get account
names and then tries simple passwords.

   Scan your password file for extra UID 0 accounts, accounts with no password,
or new entries in the password file.  Always change vendor supplied default
passwords when you install new system software.

3) Exploit holes in sendmail.

   Make sure you are running the latest sendmail from your vendor.  BSD 5.61
fixes all known holes that the intruder is using.

4) Exploit bugs in old versions of FTP; exploit mis-configured anonymous FTP

   Make sure you are running the most recent version of FTP which is the
Berkeley version 4.163 of Nov.  8 1988.  Check with your vendor for information
on configuration upgrades.  Also check your anonymous FTP configuration.  It is
important to follow the instructions provided with the operating system to
properly configure the files available through anonymous ftp (e.g., file
permissions, ownership, group, etc.).  Note especially that you should not use
your system's standard password file as the password file for FTP.

5) Exploit the fingerd hole used by the Morris Internet worm.  

Make sure you're running a recent version of finger.  Numerous Berkeley BSD
derived versions of UNIX were vulnerable.

Some other things to check for:

6) Check user's .rhosts files and the /etc/hosts.equiv files for systems
outside your domain.  Make sure all hosts in these files are authorized and
that the files are not world-writable.

7) Examine all the files that are run by cron and at.  We've seen intruders
leave back doors in files run from cron or submitted to at.  These techniques
can let the intruder back on the system even after you've kicked him/her off.
Also, verify that all files/programs referenced (directly or indirectly) by the
cron and at jobs, and the job files themselves, are not world-writable.

8) If your machine supports uucp, check the L.cmds file to see if they've added
extra commands and that it is owned by root (not by uucp!)  and world-readable.
Also, the L.sys file should not be world-readable or world-writable.

9) Examine the /usr/lib/aliases (mail alias) file for unauthorized entries.
Some alias files include an alias named 'uudecode'; if this alias exists on
your system, and you are not explicitly using it, then it should be removed.

10) Look for hidden files (files that start with a period and are normally not
shown by ls) with odd names and/or setuid capabilities, as these can be used to
"hide" information or privileged (setuid root) programs, including /bin/sh.
Names such as '..  ' (dot dot space space), '...', and .xx have been used, as
have ordinary looking names such as '.mail'.  Places to look include especially
/tmp, /usr/tmp, and hidden directories (frequently within users' home
directories).

11) Check the integrity of critical system programs such as su, login, and
telnet.  Use a known, good copy of the program, such as the original
distribution media and compare it with the program you are running.

12) Older versions of systems often have security vulnerabilities that are well
known to intruders.  One of the best defenses against problems is to upgrade to
the latest version of your vendor's system.

VMS SYSTEM ATTACKS:

13) The intruder exploits system default passwords that have not been changed
since installation.  Make sure to change all default passwords when the
software is installed.  The intruder also guesses simple user passwords.  See
point 1 above for suggestions on choosing good passwords.

14) If the intruder gets into a system, often the programs
loginout.exe and show.exe are modified.  Check these programs against
the files found in your distribution media.

If you believe that your system has been compromised, contact CERT via
telephone or e-mail.

"Who *was* that bearded man?"

Just Peter Neumann, the RISKS moderator.  He was being interviewed on CNN
last night about the recent Internet breakins.

Now for the RISKS element:

The reporter, while talking about "hacker-this" and "virus-that", used screen
shots of a terminal.  The text was obviously from some BSD-like system, because
I recognized a listing of /etc.  A moment later, for at least two seconds on
the screen, I got a clear picture of /etc/passwd!  And a few moments later, an
entire login sequence (with hostname, username, and password)!  (I wasn't
taping it... sigh. :-)

When you let the press into your cube, be sure you aren't doing something
wonderful on your screen.

Does this qualify as an "out-of-band" transmission? :-)

	I'm interested in devices along the lines of steering wheel
locks.  I would hope the cost to be under $150 if some other device
is suggested.  The car is a Volkswagon Rabbit.

	Any suggestions and opinions would be greatly appreciated.

Info on vendors in the NY city area would also be a great help.

	Please email.

Ever see a key for a late model Mercedes? There are wiggily little

I'll second this for Honda keys.  My brother accidentally used his

position, preventing the starter motor from disengaging even though
the engine had started.  The net result was an engine fire!

Luckily we always carry a fire extinguisher and managed to get the
fire out and the key unjammed before any serious damage to the engine

>I have received a report from an independent researcher,

This might have been of interest to the SECURITY list because the RSA
public key crypto system relies for its security, in part, upon the
fact that, while it is trivial to find the product of two large prime
numbers, it is difficult to find the two primes from the product.

However, it does not rely upon the elapsed time required, but rather
upon the cost.  There is a great deal of published work dealing with
trading off other cost against time.  There has even been on
demonstration using cooperating processors across the internet.  The
demonstration got the cost for large products down to days.  

The cost was not too high becasue the processors only applied otherwise
slack time to the effort.  However, it required a tremendous amount of
access and cooperation.

Perhaps more important, the RSA system does not rely upon large products
(say 2**32) or even upon astronomical numbers (say 2**56) but rather
upon super large astronomical numbers on the order of 2**400-800.  Even
this choice is arbitrary and keys of arbitrary length are possible.  The
cost or "work-factor" of attack, i.e., security, goes up exponentially
with the length of the product, but the effect on performance is linear.  

The man who comes up with an algorithm to factor arbitrarily large
numbers in linear time will not have to advertise.  Chances are one in ten
that he works for NSA, and one in twenty that he works for GBHQ.
Failing that, the chances are one in a hundred that one or the other of
those two agencies will bump him off in such a way as to cast suspicion
on the other.  Failing all of that he will certainly be famous for
fifteen minutes and may be as famous as Turing or VonNeumann, perhaps
even Einstein or Newton.

Subject: holograms on bills
To: security@rutgers.edu

First, to clarify one thing, the so-called hologram on the new
Canadian $50 is no such thing.  I don't know how it is made, but
it has the appearance of a slightly textured piece of metal foil of
solid color (with the denomination overlaid on it in opaque white).
The special feature is that the color changes from green to yellow
as the patch is viewed from different angles.

More interesting is the new Australian $10 note (as they say) that
was just being introduced when I visited there in 1988.  I delayed
mentioning this because I was hoping someone would have newer or
more detailed information on how it's made or how successful the
techniques have been.

The paper that it's printed on is unusual and feels as though it is
impregnated with plastic, like those strong mailing envelopes that
one sometimes sees nowadays.  In one corner of the note, the paper
has a *hole* of irregular, roughly circular shape, about 25 mm across.

Suspended in the center of this hole is an oval foil patch 17 x 20 mm
with a portrait.  The portrait is not done in ink, nor embossed in the
conventional way -- it appears to be delineated by many small sections
of diffraction grating, so that when viewed under a directional light,
the picture is seen in many different colors that change as the note
is turned or the viewing angle changed.  I guess the grating's rulings show
through the foil, as the back looks like a mirror image of the same picture.

Finally, the suspension of the portrait in the hole is achieved by an
almost perfectly transparent plastic section, which blends into the
main part of the note with no joint that can be felt.  (The joint can
however be seen if one looks for it.  My guess is that two pieces of
the plastic are applied to opposite sides of the hole, with the foil
patch already on one of them, and then heated to fuse everything.)
There are some more subtle details here, like the shape of the plastic
piece, but this message is long enough.

We our interested in increasing security for our:

settle (for the time being) for a simple PASSWORD to USER/ACCOUNT cross
reference validation prior to job execution.  This wouldn't prevent unauthor-

guarantee that batch job USERs are indeed who they say they are.

Because some people do not think.  People assume that it is illegal to
poke into their trash or assume that it will not be done.

Once you place a trashbag on the street for municipal pickup it
becomes public property.  Anyone can take the trashbag and do whatever
they want with it.  Commercial dumpsters and other private disposal
units may be a different case, as it could probably be argued that the
units are private property and require a warrant. (Although only the
law enforcement agencies need this, private individuals [and private
investigators] can take what they want and claim it had spilled to the
ground or been blown out by the wind, etc.)

[note: My legal background is very general, but I am fairly certain
about the trashbags on the street part]

Most credit card receipts that I know of are perforated so that the
carbon paper will split into two parts in the middle of the card
number.  Merchants are supposed to throw them away in different
trashcans or mix them up in some fashion.

Imagine a shar file that echoed lines like:

But it was really executing commands like:

Well, you get the idea.  Richard Stallman suggested that one way

I've been thinking about this problem for a while (while my library

how someone can open a safe by touch.  This is my (apparently incorrect)
understanding:

I found an old safe to experiment on (one which I know the combination
to), and spent a few minutes turning the dial and listening to the
tumblers contacting each other.  I was able to repeatedly hear all of
the clicks.  Then I thought about what the clicking information had
given me -- nearly nothing.  From the rotational distance between clicks,
you can only determine the thickness of the pins in the tumblers
which contact each other.  How can you relate this to the location of
the locking mechanism's indents? When you're turning the dial, nothing
is touching the indents, so there is no tactile information about where
they are...  You would get the same set of "clicks" no matter what the
combination is set to.

There is no such thing as a "spy proof" lock.  The term is "spy proof dial"
and refers to a dial that shields view of the numbers so they can be
seen by only the dialer.  A "spy proof" dial does not make a lock significantly
more difficult to manipulate.

No modern lock is called "manipulation proof" since manufacturers are
smart enough to not make wild claims that will cost them during litigation.
The correct term is "manipulation resistant" and refers to locks designed
with features that make traditional methods of manipulation impractical

The oxygen exits the tank through a regulator and flows through a rubber
hose at less than 90 PSI.  The 2000-4000 PSI would be a bit much for a
rubber welding hose.

Subject:  Re: Data Compression and Cryptography
To: security@pyrite.rutgers.edu

It is generally conceded that data compression of some sort is a good
thing to do to a text file before encryption.  This reduces the size
and also reduces the redundancy, making cryptanalysis more difficult.

However, if the compression scheme is known (a good presumption), and
the scheme itself introduces patterns/redundancy or known text, it may
actually give a cryptanalyst a stronger leverage point than the
uncompressed encrypted text.  For example, if a data compressor always
starts the output file with the text string "PKXARC4.1", you can probably
apply a known-plaintext attack (which may not be helpful, of course,
depending on the cryptosystem used).

Has anybody studied this problem, or surveyed compression methods and
packages?  For example, is Lempel-Ziv compression more cryptographically
"sound" than, say, ZOO or the various ARC packages commonly in use
on Personal Computers?

Key codes printed on the cores also make it really easy to isolate
the submaster zones and make it childishly simple to whip up a
grand master if you can get your hands on 2 or 3 keys from different
areas of the building.
 
Even dumber are the keys with the actual pin heights printed on
the key handle; I've seen people call a security guard to open a
door and catch the number on the guard's key, then turn around and
file a grand master from a blank in 10 or 15 minutes.

uh huh, why go to all that trouble and expense of paying the campus locksmiths
to permute the cores? Just charge any and all students that dont return their
keys $65.00 to recore the lock (like they did at my old school...).  That,
combined with the fact that the keys were BEST blanks, stamped DO NOT
DUPLICATE, and the fact that we were stuck in Bumblef***-Egypt was enuf to
keep *MOST* students from duplicating their keys....

well, with the way most institutions are, they dont want to go nutty pulling
and replacing cores every year, so they tend to stick to a standard coding
system, and a standard number of cores per floor (in the case of my university
I believe that they had 160 cores set up for each floor, and there were only
80 rooms...this gave them 80 cores to recore a door with, and over a period of
years, reusing a core to recore with was not a huge security problem...). The
code on the key corresponded to the floor you lived on (once you figured out
the positional code, it wasnt hard to break the code [i just compared about 5
keys...]), as well as the building.....another simple code told you the
room number on the floor.  Note that this was the KEY code so that the
public safety bozos could return lost keys....Stamped on the core was another
code which corresponded to the PINNING inside the lock.  That way you could
get 10 keys or so and compare the codes, but not break the great-grandmaster
pinning combination since it was stamped on the inside of the cores.

And the only people supposed to have control keys was Public Safety, and
the locksmiths.....'course you could always remove the entire lock cylinder
from the door and drill out the core retaining area, then deal with the core
...

To: security@pyrite.rutgers.edu

Removable cores? After my high-school exploits, I would heasitate to
use any such system... An associate and myself, using just calipers,
hacksaw, file, and key blanks, totally destroyed the security in our
entire school district. The high school was cored with BEST locks,
including locks on the electrical panels and padlocks.

We stole six identical cores off of three electrical panels that had
been locked open. My associate, given only the two books on locksmithing
that we'd checked out from the local library, took apart the cores,
measured the pin heights, and, given 10 BEST blanks that I'd bought
(no questions asked) from Fred Meyer's, managed to manufacture a change
key, and a key to unlock that core. He never managed to make a master
key, but we didn't need that one to move about. We'd just remove the
original door core, insert one of the electrical panel cores (we had
four left), unlock it, open the door, re-lock it, and insert the original
core. I eventually developed a pseudo-core (a dowel with properly
drilled holes) that could hold the fork to "lock" and "unlock" the
doors.

My associate and I parted ways after a difference of opinion regarding
what we would do with the keys (oh, yes, they duplicated nicely at Fred
Meyer's). There were eventually a series of thefts, and I implicated him,
but nothing could ever be proven.

A task I'd embarked upon as an enthusiastic young hacker (following the
'hacker ethic', although I didn't know it as such at the time) opened
my eyes to just how vulnerable these systems are.

PLUS, without the numbers on the outside, people (like my associate and I)
can't just casually browse the building, gathering the sub-mastering and
mastering zones and conventions. All we needed was time, and the whole thing
became plain. You could hand either of us a key, and we could tell you which
department it went to, and occasionally the teacher to whom it belonged.

I've got news for you -- that's basically all there is to it for just about
any car which has the "button" on the side of the door near the door handle...

I got locked out of my VW rabbit once, and since I didn't want to call a
locksmith (because I am one...and would never live the jeering down...:-> )
I just ripped the plastic $15.00 door handle off the door, and "poped" the
door open with my finger.

Also, listed in my "bible" of car opening how-to's is that very same method
of just putting something underneath the handle and feeling around with a
special tool till you hit the button linkage....'course a screwdriver works,
bbut it does scratch things up....

Moral: Get an alarm, and a pull out stereo, and maybe a car safe to store the
       pull out in...

yeah, and while they are "neat", they are a real pain to duplicate.  Where I
do some part-time locksmith work, I have grown to hate cutting those keys.  We
charge about $40.00 per key due to the fact that the blanks cost us about $2.00
each, and because it is very tricky.  You have to use both hands at once (one
handle controls the fwd/backward movement of the cutter, the other the
left/right...), and we always require that the car be outside our shop to
test the new key blank if the customer wants a guarantee....

> ...can set the alarm off by inserting the wrong key or trying to pick the

nope.....trying to pick it will get you basically nowhere, it's pretty
difficult and most locksmiths just drill it out, and shove a new lockset in
there....About the only thing that even resembles an "alarm" are cars equipped
with VATS, which simply checks that the value of the resistor pellet in a key
matches the authorized value in the VATS computer.  If so, and the key turns
the lock, then the car will start.  If not, and the key turns the lock, then
the car will not start, and the whole system is dead for 4 minutes.  This is
a pain for locksmiths trying to determine the proper vats key to use (there
are about 16 of them...), but at least it's a deterrant to crooks trying to
steal the car....

The problem is much deeper than that. Even if you care about the
security of your systems, there is only so much that you can do...

   1 - selecting good passwords is a start, but why to
       so many systems enforce standards only so far?

       For example, BSD based systems will allow you to
       pick a stupid password by repeating it three times.

       Also, many systems enforce standards for everyone except root!

The real problem is the complexity envolved in "doing it right". You
can't simply take a system out of the box and plug it in. You have to
be an experienced "system administrator" to know the correct things to
do... And I'm not refering to just security oriented items.

    2 - How many systems are shipped by the manufacturer with
	dangerous defaults configured in?

	SGI 4D20's will automatically flood a network if they are
	placed on the same network as a diskless Sun. You could call
	this a "denial of service" attack.

	One vendor shipped their OS software update so that all system
	directories were configured 777. And, of course, the Emacs
	distribution tapes that were use to build the "Cookoo's Egg"
	was also set to 777.

	We had a disk partition rebuilt on one of our systems; an
	administrator used 'tar' to copy all of the files from one
	partition to another. It was a short time before we discovered
	that all directories were now 777...

Then there is the problem of learning what is "right". 

    3 - I have been working on system administration since version 7 and
	yet I had never heard of, or been told about, the "commonly
	known" hole in Sendmail that the Morris Worm used.

	Most small sites do not have a full time system administrator
	who can spend time monitoring all of the networks for the
	latest patches. In fact, many do not have network access beyond
	one or two UUCP links, if that much. How are they to even learn
	that there is a problem? (Gee: Maybe their vendor should tell
	them :-(

The biggest help we could get would be for the vendors to take system
configuration constraints seriously and insure that there systems are
shipped with a default configuration that makes sense! (Of course
keeping up with bug fixes would also be nice...)

In the "hacker underground" there are numerous files on how to get into

The most common systems:

Unlike many other places cited here, Columbia University isn't quite in
the middle of nowhere, and the security here is constantly evolving to
deal with being in a neighborhood that isn't exactly the best.  (Although
I would classify no place in New York City to be 'safe'...)  There are a
few different coring systems for different sets of buildings; the whole
mastering layout is *completely* chaotic, and the only organized layout
is in the undergraduate housing, which follows conventional mastering
schemes.  Student copying of keys is rampant, and I believe they do play
"musical locks" with the cores each year.  (A common set of cores can be
circulated around a half-dozen buildings, always with a good number in
reserve.  The students are charged a whopping $50 for a simple core swap
if they lose their keys -- it's more of a deterrent than an actual
representation of any costs.  At one point (I used to hang around the
locksmiths' work area for the residence halls) someone had to go out to a
large building which required four lock changes -- he just swapped the
cores around and redistributed keys.)  The University depends far more on
the 24-hour posting of security people everywhere than physical security,
even though there are two full-time locksmiths attached to the just the
student housing people, and another seven or so for the university at
large, who have their fun making their own cores in the style of the
better Medecos, and unique "in-house" blanks and such...  Alas, the
standard key is from a set of far-from-secure Russwin blanks.  My
question is, were these things being pushed heavily at academic
institutions at one time?  I've hung around quite a few schools, and far
too many of them were using Russwin's for my comfort...

(The undergrad housing is gradually switching to these horrible Ving
punched-card style keys -- they don't work well at all, but they're cheep
cheep cheep, and they come as sets of long plastic cards, one end of
which is the key, the other end of which you stick in the back of the
lock after lifting a fragile (and often broken) plastic hatch.  Instant
disposable lock "cores".

By John Burgess, Washington Post Staff Writer

    Robert Tappan Morris, the graduate student who created the celebrated 
computer "virus" that paralyzed thousands of research computers nationwide 
in 1988, yesterday [4 May] was sentenced to three years' probation, fined 
$10,000 and ordered to perform 400 hours of community service.  He received  
no jail time.

    Morris was the first person to be brought to trial under a 1986 federal 
law designed to shore up security for the computer systems that are playing 
an increasingly critical role in American life.  His trial and sentencing   
had been closely watched by computer specialists for signs of how the justice 
system woul treat a virus case.

    Yesterday, some of these specialists argued that jail time was necessary 
to send a strong deterrent message against tampering with computers.  Others 
said that prison time would have been an overreaction to the acts of a young 
man they felt intended no harm and was guilty mainly of youthful bad judgement.

    Morris, 25, smiled broadly after his sentencing by U.S. District Judge 
Howard Munson in Syracuse, N.Y.  Morris hugged his mother, shook hands with 
his father and left the building without commenting.

    Keith Bostic, a University of California software specialist who helped 
stop the virus's spread, welcomed the decision not to send Morris to jail.  
"He was playing with fire, but he didn't really mean to burn anybody," said 
Bostic, who was called as a witness by the prosecution during Morris's trial.

    Strong condemnation came from Rep. Wally Herger (R-Calif.), author of 
legislation that would outlaw viruses.  "I am very disappointed that the 
sentence did not include some prison time for this serious offense," Herger 
said in a statement.  "In this ground-breaking case, we must send a strong 
message that computer virus outbreaks will be punished severely."

    Computer viruses are programs--sets of instructions that tell a computer 
what to do--that replicate themselves and spread from computer to computer 
over telephone lines or exchanged data discs [sic].  They can cause harm by 
deliberately destroying information or taking up so much room in an infected 
computer's memory that normal functions are slowed or shut down.

    In November 1988, a virus raced across a national network of interlinked 
research computers known as the Internet, paralyzing or slowing down almost 
6,000 machines in companies, government laboratories and universities but 
destroying no information.  The case attracted international publicity and 
led to calls for new laws to close what were perceived as loopholes.

    The virus was quickly traced to Morris, at the time a Cornell University 
graduate student.  He became a symbol of the computer "hacker" community, 
in which software enthusiasts delight in penetrating computer security 
arrangements.  Further interest was created by the fact that Morris's father, 
Robert Morris, was a senior computer scientist at the top-secret National 
Security Agency.

    Morris's trail began in January and became a test case for whether the 
1986 law, which does not mention viruses specifically, would be adequate to 
obtain a conviction.

    During the trial, Morris testified that the virus was an experiment that 
had run out of control due to a programming error.  He was convicted and 
faced up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

    Jude Franklin, who oversees computer security for Planning Research 
Corp., a McLean-based computer services company, said the prosecution and 
conviction of Morris would do the job of deterrence.  The $10,000 fine was 
"severe" for a graduate student, Franklin said.

    "Clearly he's learned a lesson," Franklin said yesterday.  "And much more 
importantly, the community of bright young graduate students and really 
bright hackers . . . have learned that this is not something they can do."

    But elsewhere, the sentence was called lenient.  Justice Department 
spokesman Doug Tillett said the department was "a little disappointed."  
U.S. Attorney Frederick J. Scullin, who oversaw the prosecution, noted in a 
statement that future offenses of this type would be prosecuted "vigorously."

    Lance Hoffman, a George Washington University professor who specializes 
in computer security, declined comment on whether Morris deserved jail.  But 
he said the sentence's lack of jail time will means [sic] the message sent to 
hackers will not be strong.

Personal Note:  There will be many flamers on this, and I think that before 
the hotter-headed among us start burning old UNIX workstations on the 
Morris's lawn, we should remember that we are part of a nation of laws.  
I do not agree with Judge Munson's sentence; I think it is little more than 
a slap on the wrist (does anyone REALLY believe that RTM Jr. won't get a 
bigger advance from his publisher than the $10K fine?); *B*U*T* Mr. Morris 
has been convicted and sentenced AND THAT'S THE END OF IT.

Thank you.

To: misc-security@rutgers.edu

Reasonable security safes are constructed so that they are not dependent
on their hinges for security.  Typically the hinges are on the outside,
so they are an obvious point of attack.  The actual locking mechanism is
usually one or more metal bars that extend into holes in the door's
frame, with enough overlap that they cannot be "sprung".

The easiest ways I know of to open safes is to manipulate them (with the
aid of a special wheel-pack plotting machine, for higher-security safes)
or to drill a hole in the right spot so that a borescope can be used to
view the fence area while the wheels are dialed so that the gates line
up with the fence.  Of course both these methods require some special
knowledge, which is a good thing too!

__________________________________________________________________________

                 
                  AN INTRODUCTION TO INCIDENT HANDLING

The University of California-Davis Department of Applied Science is
offering a special tutorial one day before the CERT Workshop on
Computer Security Incident Handling.  This tutorial covers the
fundamentals of the rapidly emerging area of computer security incident
handling.  It presents a practical approach to basic problems
encountered in detecting and recovering from different types of
incidents found in organizations, agencies, and universities throughout
the United States. The tutorial covers the following major topics:

	o Incident handling teams/networks
	o A methodology for incident handling
	o Virus infections
	o Intruder/cracker attacks
 	o Worm attacks
	o Vulnerabilities
	o Current solutions/tools

The tutorial stresses the need for balance between technical skills,
proper incident handling procedures, and efficient organizational
structure.  Presentations are supplemented with demonstrations,
videotapes, and group exercises. The tutorial is best suited for people
needing a quick overview of computer security incident handling, and
for those who were unable to attend The Invitational Workshop on
Incident Responding last Summer.  This tutorial does not generally
cover detailed technical information, such as detailed analyses of
operating system vulnerabilities.  Examples and demonstrations focus
mainly on IBM PCs and PC clones, Macintosh computers, and UNIX and VMS
systems.

Instructors:  Dr. Eugene Schultz and Thomas A. Longstaff, both from 
              Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and University  
              of California at Davis

Yes, it is, for reasons such as you outlined.

ANY operation of untrustworthy software can do similar nasty
things.  In the case of programmable software such as the shell,
this has to include the data files (such as shar archives) that are
used as programs.

Without unduly crippling the user environment, about all you can do
is to educate users about this sort of pitfall, and make sure that
you vigorously prosecute (or persecute, your choice) anyone you can
catch causing such mischief.  The system administrator should also
be made the main point of contact for installing imported software,
and should understand how to check it for security problems before
installing it.  The users should be made to expect the system
administrator to perform such tasks.

"Do not duplicate" stamping is not very effective.  Best had a series of
key sections (J, K, L) for which blanks were simply unavailable, and the
so-called "M" blanks that passed A-G (maybe H) sections would not fit
these.  That's of course not an absolute deterrent (I had a friend who
filed a blank out of a scrap piece of stainless steel), but so far as I
could tell it did thwart *most* of the college students who specialize
in lock cracking.  (Too bad course credit wasn't available for this work.)

The funny thing about the control (core removal) key was that you could
make one upon inspection of a single core, and it was just as good as a
great-grandmaster key, so long as nobody was watching while you used it.
(Once the core is removed, the actuator can be turned by a special torque
tool or even an ordinary screwdriver.)

Better than drilling the front of the lock cylinder is milling a channel
down the top; if properly done you can extract the pins (use a 45-degree
angled pin punch to uncap a pin column), remove the core, repin it, and
restore the whole assembly to the door from which it was removed.  (You
might fill the milled channel with solder before reassembly.)  However,
eventually somebody is bound to get upset at the property damage.

Subject: Security Horror Story
To: misc-security@uunet.uu.net

I was briefly associated with a local computer manufacturer in late 1985.
Of the hundred or so employees, perhaps half used the local systems regularly
and virtually all of them knew the root passwords.  And the network was such
that "root" on any system could gain root priveliges on any other system on
the net.

I visited the company last summer as a consultant to a third party.  The
third party software was installed somewhere on the network, and my host
did not know where.  He wandered off to find it.  Having nothing better to
do, I found a terminal and decided to poke around myself.  I logged in as root,
using the password from nearly four years earlier.  It worked fine.

NOte that:

	The company had not done well and had had high turnover.  As far as I
	could tell, no technical people from 1985 were still with the company.
	All the former staff knew the root password.

	When I was there the host computer was one of the manufacturer's own.
	It had been replaced by a more well-known system.  The old password
	remained.

	After my visit last year, my host asked me how I managed to log on
	as root.  I told him.  He asked me what password I used.  I told him.

I assume that after that chat the password was changed.  The company is no
longer in the usenet map and may well have gone out of business.

To me, it seems reasonable to change root passwords every few months and every
time a root user leaves the company.  This is _not_ paranoid and IMHO helps
_protect_, rather than penalize, former employees.  

Readers with stale old root passwords be warned.

Subject: Re: Locks/Security in large institutions (e.g. Universities)
To: security@pyrite.rutgers.edu

I was one (of many, I suspect) who destroyed the security at my high school.

The system was a Corbin removable core setup with grand masters and
great grand masters. It also had a novel setup we called construction
pinning. A very small pin was placed in one of the pin columns and keys
were issued that always caused this pin to fall below the line between the
core and the cylinder. However, once a key was used that would turn the
lock with this pin ABOVE the line, it would fall into a little dimple
in the cylinder. The result was that all keys issued originally would no
longer work. Our assumption was that this feature was intended for use
during building construction, since every one of these we encountered
in a completed building had the pin stuck in the dimple. This also
implied that there would be TWO control keys, one for before and one
for after. The control key would not upset the setting of the construction
pinning since the control alignment level was different enough (and
besides, the lock did not turn on the level with the dimple when the
control key was used).

We happened across a couple of locks that were DISCARDED during some
construction. Incredibly stupid. This was all we needed to produce
all the possible control keys. Blanks were no problem either. The
blank is registered, but we found that sheet metal worked just fine!
(No bending was needed, and the resulting key was a lot more durable than
the regular soft brass). We made enough control keys to finally find the
right one.

We never did much with the keys except fix about 10 locks that were
busted because of incompetent installation. This took most of the
spare parts from the locks we scavenged, but I still have the discarded
cores kicking around somewhere, I think.

Incidentally, the codes were not stamped anywhere on the cores. The keys,
however, had a code number on them that was easily transformed into the
pinning code for that key. This did not apply to grand masters and
great grand masters, which had a funky number on them, nor control
keys, which were simply stamped CONTROL (a friendly locksmith showed me
his keychain one time, also not a smart thing to do...).

There were no other security features to prevent picking in these
locks, but there was one thing to prevent picking at the control level --
that row of holes in the bottom of the control shell that you find in
some Best locks was not present in these Corbin locks. They really
were impossible to pick at the control level. But given all the other
problems with the system, I was not impressed then, and I'm not impressed
now.

>Removable-core systems make this relatively easy and inexpensive.

One caveat: although the manufacturers go to some trouble to ensure
that "ordinary" keys will not operate as masters or submasters in
the same system, they don't necessarily take the same care with the
core-removal keys.  Without any markings on the cores themselves,
one unauthorized permutation could create total havoc.

On a related note, I have a question regarding the disposable punch-
card keys used in some hotels' electronic locks.  It seems to me that
the logical design would be to program the locks from a central
console, but I've heard that a few systems use a trap-door algorithm
in a fully independent self-powered lock; that is, the lock knows what
the code should be for the next key, and invalidates the current one
the first time it sees a new key.  No data is transmitted between the
lock and the key source.  Is this so?  How do they enforce things like
check-out time?  Are codes set aside for administrative use?

Turn off the lights.  This is bound to produce complaints from anyone
in the building who is not actually asleep (or in a darkroom, if you
have one).  These complaints could take the form of a phone call, or
actually going to the front desk to check in.  If you have a well
publicized policy, then everyone will get the message eben if only some
complain.  Repeat as needed each time someone thinks they are the "last"
one on the way out.

Oh yes, a couple of emergency lights are needed to prevent total
darkness and the associated possibility of injury.  But they should be
too dim to enable someone to ignore the lights-out.

Doesn't really make a difference.  Take a look at many Ford locks, and you
find they're pin tumblers, and therefore very pickable.  Take a look at GM
locks and you find they're wafer tumblers with sidebars, making tensioning
difficult or impossible.  Kind of cute of Ford to make the key double
sided and look more formidable, but all it buys you is that you can put
it in the lock upside down (!).  The bottom line is that a slide-hammer
is all that's necessary to pull any of them out.  Assuming all they want to

  year.  They tacked on the $10 to my overall bill, and for the rest of my
  time here (I'm now a senior) I've had a key into one of our dorms, and 
  I probably could have also gotten into my old room if I really wanted to.

  As for duplicating Best keys, all you have to do is make a round of local
  locksmiths...  Most of them don't care if the key says "Do not duplicate" or
  "Unlawful to duplicate".  There is a locksmith that is about a 2 minute
  drive from our campus which will duplicate ANY key from our campus as long
  as the person getting the duplicate will sign a statement that states that
  he/she has the permission/authority to get the key duplicated and that the
  locksmith can't be held responsible for anything that may happen as a result
  of the duplicates.  There's another locksmith about 30 minutes away that won't
  even bother with this... Just walk in, drop down the keys, and he duplicates
  them.  Face it, they just want the money.  They don't care what you're gonna
  do with the keys.

  During the past four years I've had so many Best keys pass through my hands
  that (if I really wanted to) I could have duplicated them all and had access
  to most of the areas on our campus.  Once you have access to certian areas
  you can also find master keys to other areas.  For instance, our computer
  department has keys to most of the campus since all of our buildings have 
  data ports to hook up to our mainframes.  If I could get into our computer
  center, find those keys, and duplicate them all one weekend when they
  wouldn't be missed, then I'd be set for life.

  Just a few thoughts...

Subject: Method of opening office safes
To: security-request@pyrite.rutgers.edu

1 Safe doors here are usually secured by huge bolts, racked in and out by a
handle or wheel in addition to the lock. If the lock is damaged the bolts
stay put.

2 Safe hinges here are usually huge castings or forgings, carrying the door
on pivot pins of similar diameter to the door bolts. Even if they are
smashed off with a sledgehammer, the door will still hold.

3 Safes, because of these measures, often weigh too much for a freight
elevator, and often have to be installed or removed with a crane. Ours in
this building are all on the ground floor (street level).

4 If a one-tonne safe is dropped 20 stories (60m) then its kinetic energy
on impact will be enormous; similar to that of a smallish artillery shell
(about 600kJ). I certainly wouldn't bet on being able to dig it up from the
pavement before everyone came back to the office the next morning!

If safes in the USA can be opened by dropping them like this then they must
be so light and weak that I'm surprised anyone bothers to put money in
them. Money, in such circumstances, is best kept in the teapot, where
nobody would think of looking for it.

This became a matter of public interest in Tucson, Arizona.  The

They can then do anything they want with it: bury it, burn it for
energy, recycle anything that looks good, look through it for
scientific research (the actual activity in question), or search it for
incriminating material (also apparently done in some cases).

My understanding was that the city's property rights derived from an

they were restoring their original password (unless they contacted him and
told him a good reason).  He would then expire the password, and increase 
the minimum length by two.  This policy was mentioned in the welcome banner,

Subject: Security and Masterkeys
To: security@rutgers.edu

I've always wondered about the safety involved in masterkeying and who
gets the masterkeys.

   We had an incidence here a while ago now, where the cleaners room
got broken into and various masterkeys were taken.  The cleaners room
was probably one of the worst "defended" places in the university, it's
an external door (to outside) was a internal-type door {you know, the
sort that's not solid but stuffed with cardboard} and all the master-
keys left there overnight.  That's not so bad, but the cleaners' door
has one of those "Lock inside handle" locks, which you could pry open
with a screwdriver!

Masterkeys should:
		- Never be leant to anyone
		- Stamped "DO NOT DUPLICATE"
		- Not be Identified with the place they masterkey
			(I.e. stamped IMK - Better to have a system
			of codes that isn't duplicated on the lock)
		- Not ever stamped {whatever}MK - a dead giveaway
		- Always be accounted for/LOCKED away

Then there's the complacency that some people treat the loss of a
MK. "Don't worry, it'll be round here somewhere" is a common response,
in which the person has no idea where the key is but is prepared to
trade knowledge for HOPE!

Let's face it; locks buy you time and if worst comes to worst, someone
will put a truck thru the side of your building or axe a hole in your
wall to get in if it's that important.  CCTV cameras (Monitored),
{one at each end of a corridor covering the other} are a bloody good
deterrent {until some masked individuals spray paint the lens} because
there's always the chance of identification.

Has anyone, as an exercise, tried to make a very highly protected area?

P.s.	We used to use those magnetic keys that have sections for
	magnets.  What a crock!  Someone showed me how "safe" they
	are with a magnetic chess set!  One of our technicians
	came in one day and was a bit exeuberent and the whole
	lock mechanism snapped off - held in by 2 screws!

and after accepting the password says "Sorry, unable to process your
transaction at this time."  All the culprit must then do is write the
stripe to blank magcards and use them and the password on a real

All Group II safe locks, by definition, can be manipulated.  Group I locks,
which are mostly sold to the government, are not susceptible to manipulation.
(And Group I R are also proof against radiological attack - i.e., they have
plastic wheels so they can't be X-rayed.)

I believe the reason for this is that the manufacturers want the locksmith to
be able to open the (group II commercial) safe if the combination is lost, or
if someone messes up trying to change the combination.  Manipulating it open
is cheaper than drilling it.  The government, on the other hand, doesn't care
if someone gets in to the safe *provided they leave evidence they have done
so*.  If the safe is drilled, blown, etc., then they know that someone has the
secrets that were stored therein, and can take appropriate measures.  What they
don't want is someone to be able to manipulate the safe open, copy the secret
material, and then close it up leaving no evidence of tampering.

In principle, this is a feature.  The system reminds the user that the
user is making a mistake, but the user is allowed to make her own choice
(level of security).
 
The principle matters more in other cases:  When an installation chooses
users' passwords, or makes things too difficult, then the user has to
write down the password.  This might make the problem worse instead of
better.  However, the traditional Unix "recommendation" is not overly
demanding on a person's ability to memorize.
 
>       Also, many systems enforce standards for everyone except root!
 
Yes, in this case, Unix returns to its usual philosophy.  Instead of
assuming that the user knows what she wants, the assumption is that
the user never makes a mistake.  When the user is root, the system
declines to remind the user that something might be a mistake.
(Well, at least passwd only thinks that superusers are perfect.
The rest of Unix, and C, assume that ALL users want to avoid error
checking.)

2^332 (which is 8.749 x 10^99)

Using 2^332...

If you could find and multiply a million prime numbers every second
(and you can't ... the real number is more like a single prime number
every six months once you get large enough), then you would need
8.74 x 10 ^ 93 seconds, or 2.77 ^ 10 x 86 years.

If the expected time-to-live of the Universe is on the order of a
billion years, you would have to keep your computer running through
approximately 2.77 x 10 ^ 75 cycles of the Universe in order to factor
that many numbers.

By the way, storage isn't that cheap.  Especially for more digits than

To: security@pyrite.rutgers.edu

Does anybody know anything about the radionics 6112 serial protocol?

Here's the problem.  I've got my house wired with IR devices, all tied
to a radionics 6112 panel.  There are keypads throughout the house
that communicate with the panel via a "serial bus."  Every device on
the bus has a "data in" and "data out," as well as the traditional +/- power.

The keypads, also on the bus, have little lights that turn on and off
whenever one of the zones get activated.  They also have buttons that
you can push.

I've been told that DATA runs at 300 baud.  I've looked at the data in
/ data out with a terminal, but get gibberish on data out and nothing
(literally no signal) on data in.  I called up radionics and they said
that the procol is proprietary (bastards!).  So I'm looking to see if
anybody on the net knows what is going on and (I hope) has the protocol.

The data stream is constant, although there are obviously packets
(pauses between blocks of character transmission).  There appear to be
two packet sizes: about 16 characters and about 32 characters.  The
next step, I guess, would be to build a high-precision RS232 analyizer
(I could do this in software) to find the breaks between the packets,
and look for characteristic start/stop signals and stuff like that.

Of course, I can always use a parallel interface and just read the
lights directly.  But that would be a real kludge.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: summary of inexpensive antitheft devices for autos
To: misc-security@uunet.uu.net

	Well, as I promised, once the responses stopped pouring in I
would post a brief summary.  My initial post requested info on 
"inexpensive antitheft deterrents".  Many responses were redundant
and so I've combined them.

			SUMMARY

1)	Removable steering wheel: Cost under $100.  Info on manufacturer not
	provided.

2)	Installing your own ignition kill switch:  Find wire, which runs down
	steering column.  This wire is normally dead except when you crank
	the car.  This wire can be broken (low voltage side), and you can
	splice in enough wire to run to a hidden toggle switch or unlabeled
	switch.  When you leave the car the toggle switch can be set to the
	off position, the circuit will not be complete and the car won't
	crank.  Parts needed are inexpensive: electrical wire and a switch.
	J.C. Whitney's sell several other alarms for those in the NYC area.

3)	Fuel cutoff:  A similar concept to #2 but the idea is to cutoff the 
	fuel supply via a hidden toggle switch.

4) 	Steering wheel locks:  These devices attach to the steering wheel 
	and prevent the steering wheel from turning.  Many people have
	pointed out that these wheel locks are not effective against
	an skilled thief.  They point out that although the wheel lock
	itself is difficult to cut, the steering wheel isn't.  Also it 
	was stated that freon or frozen Co2 can be sprayed on the device 
	and then easily cracked.  Locks are also available which lock the
	brake pedal to the steering column.

5)	Manually disconecting components:  You can remove the spark plug
	wire, or the wire from the coil to the distributor, disabling the 
	car.  This may be useful if the car is
	left parked on the street for long periods of time and if a hood
	lock is used in conjunction.

6)	Lojack system:  a more sophisticated approach.  This is a radio
	based system with which police can keep track of the location
	of your car. OK this one might not be so inexpensive :-)

7)	Fake alarms:  This deterrent is simply the installation of blinking 
	lights etc. designed to mimic more expensive alarm systems to 
	discourage a thief.

		OTHER GENERAL SAFETY TIPS

1)	Park in a well lighted area.
2)	Keep valuables out of sight.
3)	Keep license and registration in your wallet or purse.  These items 
	help thieves to sell your car when stolen or to impersonate you if
	questioned by police.

	Well, I hope this helps others as it did me.  Thanks Again!! to all
who provided this information.

If the term had been invented, I would most likely have been considered a
major network hacker from the mid 1960's through the early 1970's.  There
were no specific laws on the books to preclude this activity.  Indeed, my
peers engaged in frequent arguments about moral, ethical, and even legal
standards that should be applied to such activities.  However, it was not
until the mid 1970's that laws were passed forbidding unauthorized access
to computer systems and networks.  When these laws were enacted we stayed
away from the kinds of attacks forbidden by the new rules.  No one wanted
to take a criminal conviction of any kind without much better reason than
mere curiosity or the challenge of seeing whether a new idea would work.

I subsequently worked as a"contract employee" providing technical support
for foreign operations by a three letter agency, as a data communications
security duty officer for another federal organization, and as manager of
academic computing for a major state university.  I am now teach graduate
courses in computer science, engineering and business administration with
several courses focusing on security threats and countermeasures relevant
to large information processing organizations.  

There is no doubt that computer crime (including network hacking and many
other forms of intrusion) now cost businesses and the governmenet a large
amount of money in the form of extra work to secure systems & intentional
theft of information, unauthorized modification, and destruction of data.
However, the prosecution failed to prove RTM intentionally harmed any of
the systems his worm penetrated.  Instead, the evidence tended to support
his claim that the harmfull consequences were largely unintentional.  If
he had set out to steal information, modify or destroy large amounts of
data there is no doubt his sentence would have been substantially greater.
Indeed, when we catch someone with such malicious intent we will need to
clearly distinguish their crime from RTM's case and throw the book at the
purpetrators.  However, in light the nature of this case, I believe the
sentence is entirely appropriate.  The frequent calls for a five year jail
term and $250,000 fine amount to the "final solution" with RTM as victim.
Such a "final solution" would not be justice for RTM's unintended crime.

Please keep in mind that RTM has suffered an arrest, brief jail time, very
intensive interrogations, serious criminal charges, conviction of a federal
felony, three years probation, 400 hours community service, and a $10,000
fine.  He has not walked away scott free.  In addition, he had to pay for
a very costly defense against the combined juggernaut of numerous federal
agencies and many other organizations screaming for a show trial and the
heaviest possible sentence.  RTM is a marked man.  His felony conviction
will follow him forever.  I seriously doubt whether RTM or anyone else who
is aware of the circumstances of this case would willingly submit to the
same penalties without a better reason than intellectual curiosity.

As far as more dangerous computer criminals ... let's catch one and go for
the throat.  The Arizona Attorney General's Office keeps testifying about
purpetrators stealing millions of dollars using computers and networks as
their working tools.  Catch just one ... hang them high ... and we may be
able to bring an end to such things.  But sending RTM to jail to be gang
raped or otherwise destroyed is not the answer to serious computer crime.

way to adminisister the password problem is to assign passwords and remove the
passwd program (as far as anyone other than root knows).

Yes, we put the crypto equipment in a large double steel door enclosed
steel box suspended on huge shock absorbers and placed a double 24 hour
marine guard with automatic weapons at the entrance with shoot to kill
and ask questions later orders.  To my knowledge no unauthorized people
ever even tried to get into the crypto vault.

To: SECURITY@OHSTVMA

I am curious about something, and I was hoping the readers of SECURITY-L
might be able to provide me with some answers.

For the past two-three years I have been actively reading everything I
can get my hands on regarding computing security, and in the process
have developed a somewhat useful personal bibliographic database to
accompany my interests.  I work iin library systems, an quite honestly
computing security is an area which hasn't been convered very thouroughly
in the professional literature of the library world - thus what began
as more of a hobby for me has become more lucrative as publishing
opportunities arise for me.

At any rate - my question is this.  I have encountered many references
to security breaches on UNIX machines, and a few related to VMS machines.
The UNIX problems are understandable given the open systems philosophy of
the operating system.  What I don't understand is that I have rarely
encountered references to security breachs on IBM machines running VM or
MVS.  Why is this?

I have seen (and narrowly avoided) the "Christmas Tree" virus which
spread from the IBM INFONET to the VM/CMS community several years ago.
But, I am more interested in references to "trapdoors" and "superuser"
account priviledges that may exist.  Is the reason that I have never
seen references because they don't exist, or is it because IBM
systems analysts/programmers have been more careful in removing such
items from the systems before they go into production?

As a final note: one reference I do have to VM/370 and MVS (OS-360)
is in Charles Pfleeger's book *Security in Computing* which I purchased
as a result of some earlier discussions on this list.  However, it
doesn't go into much detail on either system.

HAR56 is a blind code that would likely have no meaning within a different
master keying system.  The 'H' probably indicates the keyblank, 'A' the
grandmaster, 'R' the master under the 'A' GMK, and '56' the actual
change under the master.

A properly designed master keying system should arrange that HAR56 and HAR57
or HAR56 and HAS56 have no relationship that would allow someone to
calculate or guess other keys.

Whenever I set up a master keying system, I randomly select changes under
a master and randomly select masters under the GM, etc.

Sorry about this but anyone who has access to a masterkeyed door and a key
to fit it (just that one door) and has some time and a screwdriver can 
generate the masterkey.

It is not easy.  Take the lock apart, remove the spring cover, remove the
springs and pins, measure them, and put it all together again.  In every
case I am aware of the master key is the lowest key of all.  In any
event, you now can make a much reduced set of trial keys which may be tested
on nearby doors.

Metal keys mainly serve to keep the wind and small children out of enclosed

     I would like to find out more about the encryption methods used with
home-satellite audio systems.  I know the signals are digitally encoded and
encrypted with the DES encryption algorithm.  This scheme (called
VideoCipher II) was designed by General Instruments.  I understand that a
variation of this has been released (VideoCipher II plus) which is more
secure.  A friend of mine has a set of replacement EPROM's in his
descrambler unit which allow him to receive all scrambled channels, once
given a valid key for one scrambled channel.  Apparently even one valid key
is not necessary for some reprogrammed EPROMs.  Can anyone tell me how this
works?  Does anyone have any information about the new VC2+ encryption
algorithms?  I have seen (and ordered from) adds for software which
explains and demonstrates VC2 encryption techniques.  Please send any
pointers or references.  I read that there are BBS's which might be
helpful, but the ones I have tried are no longer running.

prevention of viruses in the DECUS Program Library

        These days many people are hesitating to use public domain
        software. This might become a problem for the DECUS
        Program Library. The DECUS Program Library is a big
        repository of very useful software for DEC's machines
        like Rainbow, Professional, PDP11 and VAX. The PL is run
        by volunteers selling software, submitted by
        DECUS-members, to DECUS-members.

        A lot of things can be done to prevent Trojan-problems:

        - demand and verify the name and/or organization of the
          submitter of the software
        - always demand the sources and full documentation
        - test the software
        - implement a file-CRC-checksum procedure to be sure the
          received software is the same as originally submitted

        A lot of questions and problems remain however:

        - testing the software costs a lot of time.
          More than a volunteer can offer perhaps.
        - how do you check source code for Trojans?
          Ever tried to check more than 20 pages of BLISS,
          assembler, C or PASCAL?
        - is there a file-CRC-checksum procedure that can be used
          for a variety of machines and operating systems?

I need to secure some communications lines between several terminals and a

The boxes must be bidirectional (of course) and must run a reasonably
secure encryption scheme, such as DES.  The key must be readily changeable
by non-computer types, but *only from the DTE side*.  The originator of the
data call (at one of the terminals) must be able to connect in plaintext mode
to tell the packet switch s/he wants to connect to the Computer of Interest,
then switch to encrypted mode once the connection is established (really, with
the box at the other end) without dropping the connection.

The "packet switch" in the above diagram may be more than one physical
switch, linked by leased lines.

The box and associated connections between the Packet Switch and the Computer
of Interest may be many separate serial lines, each with its own box.

The idea is to give several people around the country a local number to dial
and to have the unencrypted portion of the data path be as physically short
and as easy to secure as possible.

Operations will probably be conducted at 1200 or 2400 baud, although 9600
is a possibility.

Is there such an animal as the "BOX" in the diagram?  How about a few pointers
to some vendors?

Group II locks offer no intentional protection against manipulation, but
wheel shadowing, sticky flies, etc can prevent successful manipulation.

Group I locks can also be manipulated in an infinite period of time but
cannot be manipulated within 20 hours, which makes them group I.

Group 1R locks meet Group I guidlines and are additionally immune to
radiological attack.

The only problem is that within an organization, a level of trustworthiness
may be assumed among users, and various other security controls may be
relaxed, based on this.  It helps in getting work done.

However, if one user makes the mistake of chosing a low level of security
for themselves (e.g., an easy password), many other users may be affected.

Of course, there are other ways they can leave themselves wide open (e.g.,
access modes on certain files), but at least we can try and stop the

You can, for instance, get a job from the NSA.  You can also get a job
interview, reimbursement for your travel expenses, and the like.

On a slightly more serious note, you can get papers that the NSA has

work and publishes papers, as well as presents them at various meetings.

You can get a bibliography from the NSA of all the books that have

Sorry Leonard.  You must not be aware of any professionally designed
master keying systems that were set up according to common locksmithing
industry standards.

A properly selected master key must be impossible to create by filing
a change key.  That means it must contain at least one cut that is
taller than the corresponding cut in every change key.  The master
key should also have a wide assortment of cuts so that the master key
shear line in the lock (every lock) is difficult to pick.

If the master key was always the "lowest key of all", whatever that means,
it would be a very flat key or provide very few cut depths (and thus
key combinations) for the change keys.

Calculating the top level master key by measuring pins becomes increasingly
difficult as the number of levels (i.e., MK, GMK, GGMK, GGGMK, etc)
increases.  It is possible for a lock in a single level master-keying
system to have more pins than an idential lock in a four level system.

That's a pretty tall order - Not susceptable to manipulation.  It's probably
more accurate to say that
	It's not manipulatable in a short time with current common knowledge

Locks really only buy you time.  Although I agree with your comments about
group I locks (people will KNOW if you've been in), most new locks were
non-manipulatable until someone did it.  I would always leave the shadow of

One University I attended had the policy that the master key was
always the deepest key cut.  If you took apart a multi-keyed cylinder
and made a key with the deepest of all the possible cuts, you reliably
ended up with a grand-master key for the building or even group of
buildings!  It made collecting the "complete master key collection"
rather easy--just one cylinder to take apart  per building.

On a recent visit I noticed they had rekeyed with Medeco Bi-axial locks, but
I'm afraid I didn't have the time to see if they had learned any lessons 
about keying plans.

In a properly designed system, it shouldn't be.  Otherwise, any "day key"
(ordinary operating key) could be filed down to produce a master key.
This would especially compromise security when restricted blanks are used.

However, the procedure you suggest can often be used in modified form
to determine the highest-level masterkey, because if there are multiple
splits in a pin column you can be fairly sure that the one that matches
your day key is NOT the master split, and if there is only one split
then your day key and all levels of master key must share that depth in
that column.  Thus, if there are no more than two splits in each column,
using the ones that differ from your day key (when there is a choice)
will very likely produce the highest level master key.  (Lower-level
mastering is often done by sharing splits in a column or two with the
day keys in that submaster group.)

It's been done before, pretty much as you described. The article I saw was
on the RISKS Digest some time back. It may have also appeared in this
newsgroup as well.

Some details:

(1) The fake machine was built in front of the real one, which if done
    in an inobvious manner insures a lot of "clientele" - the regular users.

(2) I believe the machine swallowed the cards completely, saying that it
    was confiscating them or some such. This saves the trouble of getting
    a card reader operational.

I don't recollect where this occurred. I don't keep such details handy.
It wasn't here in Claremont, CA -- I would have remembered *that*.

All in all, given the limit on the amount of cash dispensed per card, it
does not sound like a very effective scam. Better to rip off/out the whole
machine, as some have done. My recollection is that the amount reported
stolen was large enough to make it cost-effective but not stunningly so.

An interesting question -- is this sort of thing a white or blue collar
type of crime? I recently heard a statistic comparing the amount stolen
in your basic blue collar bank robbery (peanuts), white collar robbery
(i.e. fraud, in the millions), the chances of getting caught (blue collar
quite high, white collar quite low), and the penalties if caught (blue collar
quite severe, white collar quite lenient). In view of the active nature of
such a crime, it comes across like a stickup. But it is quite clever...
like a clever scheme for fraud. Thoughts?

It's pretty easy to figure.  There are two pinning schemes for Best
locks:  10 depths at 12.5 mil increments and 7 depths at something
like 18 mil increments.  The former is the most common; however, to
avoid using 12.5 mil pin sections, which tend to jam, the convention
is to use only every second depth for each pin in the 10-depth scheme.
Thus, pin columns can be labelled "even" or "odd", depending on which
of the two alternate sets of depths they use.  If you were to pin a
core with splits every 25 mils, with the bottom pin segment chosen as
a #0 or #1 length depending on whether the column is even or odd, the
core would open on any key in the system.  (This would make a good
universal substitute for replacing a core removed for study, since it
would open the lock for its intended keyholder -- as well as others
in the unlikely event that they were to try while the substitute is
in place.)  Anyway, the number of possible day key changes for the
10-depth scheme can therefore be no more than 5^7 = 78125, while for
the 7-depth scheme it is no more than 7^7 = 823543.  The actual
number is reduced by three considerations:  Some key bittings are too
insecure, for example all depths the same can be unlocked by a stiff
straight wire.  Some key bittings are infeasible (at least for some
lock brands, possibly not Best), for example the deepest depth adjacent
to the most shallow depth (the deep cut's slope overlaps the base of
the shallow one's).  And finally, to avoid accidental cross-keying,
the day keys cannot use the master-key depths.  This latter
consideration lowers the upper limit to 4^7 = 16384 and 6^7 = 279936,
respectively, for one level of masterkeying.  Since most campuses
use multiple levels of masterkeying (3 or 4 is typical), cross-keying
avoidance reduces the number of day key changes still further.  There
are probably no more than 2000 available; to go beyond that multiple
keyway sections are normally used.  Best offers several, in at least
two distinct families, with special blanks available for the masterkeys
to allow them to pass multiple keyway sections within the family.

I've never encountered a masterkeying setup where duplicate day keys
for different access was considered acceptable practice, so I suspect
they're not using that at your campus either.

>p.s. are there any other HAR56's out there?

The "HAR" codes are specific to your campus.

Subject: Re: Best Locks
To: strick@osc.com

I remember hacking Best locks in high school, say about 17 years ago (now it 
can be told).  There are a lot more than 250 possible combinations.

We had "A" blanks, 6-pin tumblers, and a keying system called "X".  Each pin 
could be cut at at either the odd or even 5 of 10 possible levels.  With one 
level reserved for the master cut, that left 4 cuts/pin for pass keys.  That 
means there were 4,096 possible pass keys.

The locks were zoned into 64 groups of 64, with the school apparently having 
only licensed the first 8 zones.  The 3 shallowest cuts (neat the handle end 
of the key) varied within a zone.  Different zones were lettered A-H, and 
assigned to different departments within the school -- something like A for 
upper school, B for offices, C for the kitchen, D for boarding student's 
rooms, E for maintenance and grounds, F for the middle school, G for the gym, 
and H for the lower school.  (These are probably scrambled -- it's been a long 
time.)

The keys were stamped with codes ranging from XA1 to XH64.  The codes were in 
simple base-4 correspondence to the cuts, starting from the first cut 
modularly above the master cut as zero.  It was only necessary to measure 3 
keys with a microcaliper to solve the whole system except for the control key.
We made a pretty good guess at the control key (one of 2 patterns).

They stamped these numbers on the locks, too.  Since they really wanted to 
label everything, it's really too bad they didn't use a random codebook.  (We 
made friends with the locksmith later and he used a codebook, not the math.)

The "X" corresponded to the pattern of evens and odds of the individual pins.  
I suppose in theory that 64 different patterns could have been given out, but 
any pattern that had only one (or even two) differences of even/oddness had 
better be on a different blank (or 1000+ miles away) or there would be too 
much chance of interchangability of keys.

The other basis I have for thinking that they only licensed part of "X" is 
that their grand master key had a passkey cut for the deepest pin.  This would 
only open 1/4 of the possible X locks (twice as many as they actually used).

We got quite a rise out of the administration by showing them just how easy it 
had been to solve their key system, and describing the real grand master (not 
the one they had) without ever having seen it.  The two of us who confronted 
them were threatened with instant expulsion if we were ever caught USING such 
knowledge; we didn't tell them about the others...

I think they had the cheapest available system, or maybe it was just bought 
early in Best's career.  The cores had those convenient holes for picking the 
core sleeve.  The pins had little (removable!) press in caps over the springs, 
so we could pick and remove a core, disassemble it and measure the pins, and 
reassemble and replace it, unharmed.  Took about an hour, but we were 
amateurs.  There were mushroom pins in some of the cores.  The locks, by the 
way, had a master key cut for the deepest pin, even though the school didn't 
use it.  (Maybe the police or Best co?)

There were competing groups of students who stole padlocks and disassembled 
them to figure out the system.  There must have been 3 separate successful 
masterkey projects in my class alone (I knew of 2, counting my own, and had 
evidence of another.  There might have been more, but with a graduating class 
of 59, I doubt it).  Someone let themselves into the locksmith's shop and 
stole the key machine the next year; very crude, they should have used it on 
the premises so no one would have suspected.

Best locks are convenient, but only elementary schools should dare to use 
them.  RPI used them also; when I went to check the place out senior year, 
practically the first thing I noticed was in the undergraduate handbook where 
it threatened instant expulsion to anyone who was caught with a master key.  
Might as well try to sweep back the tide.  I went to a college with a more 
relaxed attitude.

Speaking of common practice, key combinations are recycled.  Suppose that 
there are 40 doors and 64 possible keys.  If you "lose" your key, you pay a 
fine and get a new lock and key.  24 lost keys later, someone else will get a 
new copy of your "lost" key.  The loss rate is fairly low; the migration of 
students from room to room each year is much more likely to create 
unauthorized access.
