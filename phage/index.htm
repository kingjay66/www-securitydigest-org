Gene Spafford began the Phage List on 3rd November 1988 as a forum for
communication during the Robert T. Morris worm emergency, and though largely
a relic by January 1989, its last message is dated 24th May 1989. The list
operated out of Purdue University. Initially concerned with identifying and
eradicating the worm, the list turned to reflect and consider broader issues
in computer security, including methods of disclosure and responsible
release of source code. The list had a short life, and after the incident,
it quickly retired to become a conduit for follow-up announcements.
Participants included Gene Spafford, Dennis Ritchie, Neil Gorsuch, Douglas
Comer, Keith Bostic, Matt Bishop, Paul Vixie, and Theodore Ts'o. An
approximate count shows the list having over 160 readers, and 128 posters,
for a total of 387 messages (plus 4 unaccounted for), comprising 14530 lines
and 558 kilobytes.

<p>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">INTRODUCTION</span>
</p>

<p>
The following annotation of the Phage List is concerned with the role that the list played 
in the resolution of the Morris worm emergency. For more comprehensive details about the incident
itself, refer to the original papers by
Spafford [<a href="#RESOURCE-WORM_TR_SPAF">RESOURCE-WORM_TR_SPAF</a>], 
Reynolds [<a href="#RESOURCE-RFC_1135">RESOURCE-RFC_1135</a>], and
Eichin & Rochlis [<a href="#RESOURCE-WORM_TR_ROCHLIS">RESOURCE-WORM_TR_ROCHLIS</a>]. Spafford's
10 year [<a href="#RESOURCE-WORM_TR_10YEARS">RESOURCE-WORM_TR_10YEARS</a>]
and 15 year [<a href="#RESOURCE-WORM_TR_15YEARS">RESOURCE-WORM_TR_15YEARS</a>] anniversary 
works must also be considered.
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">THE INCIDENT BEGINS</span>
</p>

<p>
The Robert T. Morris worm (often referred to as "The Internet Worm") began its life in the early evening of 2nd 
November 1988 [<a href="#RESOURCE-WORM_TR_SPAF">RESOURCE-WORM_TR_SPAF</a>]. Early messages about the 
existence of the worm include those by Peter Yee at 02:45EST [<a href="archive/383">ARCHIVE-383</a>] 
and "foo@bar.arpa" (later revealed to be Andy Sudduth) at 03:34EST [<a href="archive/410">ARCHIVE-410</a>]. 
At 05:58EST, Keith Bostic posted a patch to USENET, and at 08:18EST this 
patch was forwarded by Gene Spafford to a number of "friendly" recipients 
(including Neil Gorsuch, Andrew Burt, Paul Vixie, etc) with the subject "Virus 
alert!" [<a href="archive/000">ARCHIVE-000</a>]. 
</p>

<p>
Later that morning at 10:36EST -- now the day after the worm had been released --
Gene sent another message with "More on the virus", including an early 
modus operandi [<a href="archive/001">ARCHIVE-001</a>]. By mid afternoon at 14:50EST, there was "Yet 
more on the virus" [<a href="archive/002">ARCHIVE-002</a>] and a "closed" discussion continued into 
the night [<a href="archive/004">ARCHIVE-004</a>] [<a href="archive/006">ARCHIVE-006</a>] [<a href="archive/005">ARCHIVE-005</a>] [<a href="archive/009">ARCHIVE-009</a>] 
[<a href="archive/008">ARCHIVE-008</a>]. By now, the incident had reached radio and TV [<a href="archive/007">ARCHIVE-007</a>], 
and a network management bulletin had been issued at 17:32EST
[<a href="archive/383">ARCHIVE-383</a>]. Discussions were active on USENET [<a href="#USENET-1988-11-03">USENET-1988-11-03</a>].
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">THE LIST IS CREATED</span>
</p>

<p>
The first signs of the Phage List are found in the evening of the 3rd November 
1988 at 21:20EST. In a message by Gene Spafford [<a href="archive/013">ARCHIVE-013</a>], with 
subject "A worm 'condom' enclosed.", he wrote:
<br><table class="descr-quot-table"><tr><td>
First, I have created (at Steve Bellovin's suggestion) a mailing alias at 
arthur.cs.purdue.edu named "phage."  You are all on it, unless you ask to be 
removed.  I will also add other names if you ask.
</td></tr></table>
The message also offered more detail about the worm, including its mode of 
operation, first hand experience of its infection, and an early cure. 
</p>

<p>
It was clear that was that the Phage List was to become a communication 
forum for helping participants resolve the emergency. Afterwards, Mark Eichin 
and Jon Rochlis were to write [<a href="#RESOURCE-WORM_TR_ROCHLIS">RESOURCE-WORM_TR_ROCHLIS</a>] that 
<br><table class="descr-quot-table"><tr><td>
It included all the people [Gene Spafford] had been mailing virus information 
to since the morning; more people were to be added during the next few days. 
This list proved invaluable, since it seemed to have many of the 'right' people 
on it and seemed to work in near real time despite all the network outages.
</td></tr></table>
</p>

<p>
In the evening, Douglas Comer thought to ask about the pronunciation of 
"phage" [<a href="archive/384">ARCHIVE-384</a>], to which Gene and others replied [<a href="archive/385">ARCHIVE-385</a>] 
[<a href="archive/390">ARCHIVE-390</a>]. The word "phage" had been used before, but the Morris 
worm would become "the first example" of one as the term was originally 
defined [<a href="#USENET-2000-12-17">USENET-2000-12-17</a>]. Clarifying the terminology was an important 
aspect of later technical reports [<a href="#RESOURCE-WORM_TR_SPAF">RESOURCE-WORM_TR_SPAF</a>], and disputes 
over the correctness of the media coverage.
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">THE INCIDENT UNFOLDS AND IS INCREASINGLY UNDERSTOOD</span>
</p>

<p>
In the hours leading up to midnight in the evening of the day after the worm 
had been released, the list saw a stream of messages about existing cures 
[<a href="archive/016">ARCHIVE-016</a>], new cures [<a href="archive/015">ARCHIVE-015</a>] [<a href="archive/017">ARCHIVE-017</a>] [<a href="archive/018">ARCHIVE-018</a>], 
faulty cures [<a href="archive/019">ARCHIVE-019</a>] [<a href="archive/021">ARCHIVE-021</a>], impending cures [<a href="archive/020">ARCHIVE-020</a>]
and worm traps [<a href="archive/389">ARCHIVE-389</a>]. Interleaved with this were further details 
of the worm's nature [<a href="archive/022">ARCHIVE-022</a>] or reports of the worm's progress 
[<a href="archive/024">ARCHIVE-024</a>]. 
</p>

<p>
Early in the morning at 03:51EST, Greg Skinner referred to the central role 
being played by the list [<a href="archive/386">ARCHIVE-386</a>]:
<br><table class="descr-quot-table"><tr><td>
From the looks of the list contents and participants, the virus is pretty 
widespread and not quite yet under control.
Does anyone have a feel for how much actual damage has been done to 
sites, how many sites have disconnected from the net, how much service has 
been disrupted, how upset or angry DCA/DARPA is, and who are the 
perpetrators?
Aside from this list, I haven't been able to find out much about what has 
happened.  I expected tcp-ip to be full of messages about it, but it wasn't. I 
didn't know whether or not that was because no one was taking much of an 
interest in the problem, or that most everyone has signed off the net until the 
virus is under control.
</td></tr></table>
</p>

<p>
As the morning rolled in -- a continuation of the previous day for some 
[<a href="archive/389">ARCHIVE-389</a>] -- details arrived about "External Exposure of [the] problem" 
[<a href="archive/388">ARCHIVE-388</a>] referring to reports in radio and print media. This sparked a 
number of follow up messages about other news reports [<a href="archive/023">ARCHIVE-023</a>] 
[<a href="archive/025">ARCHIVE-025</a>]. It was disturbing to find that despite these very high profile 
external reports, Greg Skinner maintained that "Aside from this list, I still have 
not heard much about the virus or its ramifications." [<a href="archive/028">ARCHIVE-028</a>].
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">THE INCIDENT IS UNDERSTOOD AND INCREASINGLY CONTAINED</span>
</p>

<p>
The worm was still in the process of being contained, yet a reflective nature 
was entering the discussions. Mark Verber suggested that the "Security 
Mailing List" that "died about a year ago due primarily to inactivity" should 
return but with a number of changes [<a href="archive/108">ARCHIVE-108</a>]. Matt Crawford 
expressed annoyance at "unneighborly" sites where information was "being 
hoarded" [<a href="archive/027">ARCHIVE-027</a>], and continued the debate over the return of the 
security list [<a href="archive/393">ARCHIVE-393</a>], as did others [<a href="archive/037">ARCHIVE-037</a>]. 
</p>

<p>
It was now the morning of Friday 4th November 1988; some 36 hours after 
the worm had been discovered. The list had allowed participants to exchange 
information about the incident itself, and to collaborate in their attempts to 
manage the incident. Discussions continued during the day [<a href="archive/029">ARCHIVE-029</a>] 
[<a href="archive/030">ARCHIVE-030</a>] [<a href="archive/031">ARCHIVE-031</a>] [<a href="archive/033">ARCHIVE-033</a>], and included systems 
administrators asking their peers about how to make their systems safe 
[<a href="archive/034">ARCHIVE-034</a>] [<a href="archive/032">ARCHIVE-032</a>] [<a href="archive/038">ARCHIVE-038</a>]. 
</p>

<p>
At 14:32EST that Friday, Rich Kulawiec provided a comprehensive summary 
of "Steps in the virus, as best we know them (and fixes)" [<a href="archive/035">ARCHIVE-035</a>], 
indicating that considerable progress was being made. In response to this, 
Theodore Ts'o described activity that had started the previous night at MIT to 
disassemble the code and had "succeeded this morning" [<a href="archive/041">ARCHIVE-041</a>]. 
Theodore also pointed out "a few 'fixes' and descriptions that have been 
floating around this list, which appear to be not fully correct" [<a href="archive/042">ARCHIVE-042</a>]. 
The sensitive nature of the material on the list was reflected in Martha Rose's 
comment that "Given the kinds of info going around here, I agree with the 
suggestions that aliases such as 'postmaster' be phased out..." [<a href="archive/039">ARCHIVE-039</a>].
</p>

<p>
The first part of the worm's source code arrived to the list at 17:11EST on 
Friday afternoon [<a href="archive/182">ARCHIVE-182</a>], having resulted from work by Don Becker 
that had been distributed to another list at MIT at 12:11EST earlier in the day. 
After a trickle of messages, it was becoming clearer by the evening that worm 
was increasingly being brought under control: "a number of sites have fixed 
ftpd locally and have unofficially distributed the fixed server to sites without 
source" [<a href="archive/397">ARCHIVE-397</a>]. A message from Keith Bostic at 17:20EST 
[<a href="archive/044">ARCHIVE-044</a>] provided a fourth and "hopefully the final posting [...] 
regarding the worm that was released onto the Internet" with more patches. 
However, "general network connectivity [was] still bad" [<a href="archive/394">ARCHIVE-394</a>]: either 
a result of the worm itself or networks that had been intentionally 
disconnected.
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">THE INCIDENT IS INCREASINGLY CONTAINED</span>
</p>

<p>
At 01:47EST in the morning on Saturday 5th November, it was brought to the 
lists attention that the "culprit [had been] identified": the worm originated from 
Cornell and the perpetrator was a Robert Morse [sic] Jr whose father was 
"apparently head of the National Computer Security Center" [<a href="archive/047">ARCHIVE-047</a>]. 
Almost immediately, a CNN report with further detail was forwarded to the list 
[<a href="archive/077">ARCHIVE-077</a>]. 
</p>

<p>
Traffic on the list was slow on Saturday morning -- perhaps many were 
recovering from the last few late nights. Steven Miller asked whether "MIT and 
perhaps others" could make the disassembled virus objects available 
[<a href="archive/048">ARCHIVE-048</a>]. Others were interested in the source code [<a href="archive/053">ARCHIVE-053</a>], 
and while musing over issues, Theodore Ts'o referred to the nature of the list 
[<a href="archive/400">ARCHIVE-400</a>], and raised issues about how "safe" it was:
<br><table class="descr-quot-table"><tr><td>
One thing about this list: it was assembled hastily for an emergency purpose. 
Great thanks to Gene Spafford for creating it! As an emergency list, however, 
it has a large number of bad addresses on it (or shutdown mailers :-) At some 
point, we should retire this list, and re-create the security mailing list. While 
people may agree or disagree about whether the security list should be 
``secure'' (and please let's not rehash all of this again here), we should 
remember that this list is _not_ secure. Not that this was a problem, since the 
more information that could be distributed on the virus, the better. But some 
people may disagree about whether this is appropriate for general security 
discussions. 
</td></tr></table>
</p>

<p>
By Saturday afternoon, volume on the list was increasing. Keith Bostic's 
message stating that MIT would "not make [the disassembled virus objects] 
available to ANYBODY" [<a href="archive/050">ARCHIVE-050</a>] kicked off a debate about the merits 
of disclosing the source. This debate considered the intentions of, and 
implications for, the worm's author [<a href="archive/051">ARCHIVE-051</a>] [<a href="archive/052">ARCHIVE-052</a>] 
[<a href="archive/054">ARCHIVE-054</a>] [<a href="archive/057">ARCHIVE-057</a>] [<a href="archive/055">ARCHIVE-055</a>] [<a href="archive/058">ARCHIVE-058</a>] [<a href="archive/059">ARCHIVE-059</a>]
[<a href="archive/060">ARCHIVE-060</a>] [<a href="archive/061">ARCHIVE-061</a>] [<a href="archive/062">ARCHIVE-062</a>] [<a href="archive/073">ARCHIVE-073</a>]. 
Reactions were occasionally strong [<a href="archive/069">ARCHIVE-069</a>] [<a href="archive/074">ARCHIVE-074</a>], and the 
discussion continued into the night and over the next few days, becoming the 
largest thread on the list. For the rest of Saturday, apart from that debate, a 
varied mixture of messages referred to external reporting [<a href="archive/056">ARCHIVE-056</a>] 
[ARCHIVE-63], further worm details [<a href="archive/064">ARCHIVE-064</a>], cures [<a href="archive/072">ARCHIVE-072</a>], 
cure corrections [<a href="archive/066">ARCHIVE-066</a>] [<a href="archive/067">ARCHIVE-067</a>] [<a href="archive/070">ARCHIVE-070</a>] [<a href="archive/071">ARCHIVE-071</a>], 
and anecdotes about the worm's author [<a href="archive/068">ARCHIVE-068</a>].
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">ATTENTION TURNS TO THE WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE INCIDENT</span>
</p>

<p>
The focus was turning away to broader issues. That Sunday the 6th 
November 1988, Phil Karn remarked elsewhere: "Now that we have a pretty 
good idea who wrote the virus and what his intentions were, I would like to 
suggest something he might do that would go a long way toward mitigating 
the damage he has done." [<a href="#USENET-1988-11-06">USENET-1988-11-06</a>]. The next day, it was 
apparent to Phil that "After I posted my note, I discovered that the phage 
mailing list has had a raging debate about precisely this point." [<a href="#USENET-1988-11-07">USENET-1988-11-07</a>]. 
It would seem that USENET was not host to debate about meta-issues, but the Phage list was the place to be.
</p>

<p>
Sunday saw a brief response by Douglas Comer on virus litigation [<a href="archive/078">ARCHIVE-078</a>]. 
The discussion about making the disassembly available continued 
[<a href="archive/079">ARCHIVE-079</a>], and suggestions for dealing with the media in reporting of the 
incident were proposed [<a href="archive/080">ARCHIVE-080</a>] [<a href="archive/081">ARCHIVE-081</a>] [<a href="archive/161">ARCHIVE-161</a>] 
[<a href="archive/082">ARCHIVE-082</a>] [<a href="archive/132">ARCHIVE-132</a>] [<a href="archive/084">ARCHIVE-084</a>]. There was thought given to 
the need for a security mailing list for "life after worm" [<a href="archive/083">ARCHIVE-083</a>], and in 
the hours after midnight, Jon Rochlis had begun to analyse the reason why 
fixes had taken so long, and what knowledge would have helped stop the 
worm earlier [<a href="archive/085">ARCHIVE-085</a>]. Jon later authored one of the substantial 
technical reports on the incident [<a href="#RESOURCE-WORM_TR_ROCHLIS">RESOURCE-WORM_TR_ROCHLIS</a>].
</p>

<p>
In the background, Gene Spafford had returned from a weekend away and 
was adding new members to the list [<a href="archive/402">ARCHIVE-402</a>] [<a href="archive/082">ARCHIVE-082</a>]. He 
suggested that "we may want this list to remain around for a few weeks" and 
enclosed a list of current recipients [<a href="archive/086">ARCHIVE-086</a>]: there were 77 names 
(some 15 were postmasters or other aliases), including Andrew Burt, Neil 
Gorsuch, Stephen Bellovin, Paul Vixie and Douglas Comer. 
</p>

<p>
That Monday morning -- now the 7th November 1988 -- Dennis Ritchie lent his 
hand to the debate by discussing issues of responsibility and security 
[<a href="archive/089">ARCHIVE-089</a>] and this turned into an expansive philosophical discussion 
[<a href="archive/092">ARCHIVE-092</a>] [<a href="archive/093">ARCHIVE-093</a>] [<a href="archive/095">ARCHIVE-095</a>] [<a href="archive/097">ARCHIVE-097</a>] [<a href="archive/105">ARCHIVE-105</a>]
[<a href="archive/160">ARCHIVE-160</a>]. Other utilitarian discussions had also become 
philosophical [<a href="archive/096">ARCHIVE-096</a>] [<a href="archive/100">ARCHIVE-100</a>] [<a href="archive/103">ARCHIVE-103</a>], and were 
focusing on issues in computer security itself [<a href="archive/109">ARCHIVE-109</a>] [<a href="archive/104">ARCHIVE-104</a>]: 
in particular, [<a href="archive/101">ARCHIVE-101</a>] is concerned with responsible disclosure. 
</p>

<p>
These discussions were a distinct shift away from the practical aspects of 
halting the worm. It was clear that critical aspects of the event were over, and 
it was time to reflect on the meta-issues. Gene Spafford clarified the 
terminology by distinguishing the differences between a "worm" and a "virus" 
by drawing from historical references [<a href="archive/107">ARCHIVE-107</a>] [<a href="archive/111">ARCHIVE-111</a>] 
[<a href="archive/231">ARCHIVE-231</a>]. Various individuals discussed punishment and implications 
for the author [<a href="archive/114">ARCHIVE-114</a>] [<a href="archive/117">ARCHIVE-117</a>] [<a href="archive/118">ARCHIVE-118</a>] [<a href="archive/123">ARCHIVE-123</a>] 
[<a href="archive/121">ARCHIVE-121</a>]. 
</p>

<p>
Discussion also focused on misrepresentation of the issues by the media 
[<a href="archive/104">ARCHIVE-104</a>] [<a href="archive/106">ARCHIVE-106</a>] [<a href="archive/110">ARCHIVE-110</a>] [<a href="archive/113">ARCHIVE-113</a>] [<a href="archive/119">ARCHIVE-119</a>] 
[<a href="archive/128">ARCHIVE-128</a>] [<a href="archive/136">ARCHIVE-136</a>]: that evening, Bob Page provided an 
initial 5-page report "to try and set them straight" [<a href="archive/403">ARCHIVE-403</a>]. The worm 
and its propagation continued to be addressed [<a href="archive/116">ARCHIVE-116</a>] [<a href="archive/120">ARCHIVE-120</a>] 
[<a href="archive/122">ARCHIVE-122</a>]. Other vulnerabilities were being given attention 
[<a href="archive/196">ARCHIVE-196</a>] (later taken elsewhere [<a href="#USENET-1988-11-22">USENET-1988-11-22</a>]), and testing 
tools were circulated [<a href="archive/404">ARCHIVE-404</a>]. Debate about whether to publish the 
source code continued [<a href="archive/124">ARCHIVE-124</a>], and USENIX announced that it would 
hold a formal session covering worms in February [<a href="archive/125">ARCHIVE-125</a>]. There 
were further requests to be placed onto the list [<a href="archive/409">ARCHIVE-409</a>]. 
</p>

<p>
Monday evening also saw a revived discussion about restarting the Security 
Mailing List, either in its existing (as previously maintained by Andrew Burt), or 
new (as suggested by Neil Gorsuch) form [<a href="archive/406">ARCHIVE-406</a>] [<a href="archive/407">ARCHIVE-407</a>] 
[<a href="archive/142">ARCHIVE-142</a>]. Some of these "meta-issues" were also raised in relation to 
the Phage List itself [<a href="archive/143">ARCHIVE-143</a>].
</p>

<p>
Gene Spafford reported on an "Interesting meeting" to occur the following day 
at the National Computer Security Center, involving "people from MIT, 
Berkeley, FBI, NSA, and others", that was "to discuss the worm and 
implications" [<a href="archive/127">ARCHIVE-127</a>]. He asked whether an attendee could provide a 
summary of the meeting to the list. 
</p>

<p>
By that evening, Gene indicated that there were "a couple hundred names on 
the list now, a few of which are local aliases for 'postmaster' or 'phage'", and 'I 
hope this list will be unneeded in a few days. The regular security lists should 
be sufficient to talk about security issues -- I don't intend to administer a 
closed security mailing list -- I don't have the time or energy." [<a href="archive/134">ARCHIVE-134</a>]
</p>

<p>
There were a number of messages discussing Robert T. Morris as a person, 
including references to his previous activities [<a href="archive/141">ARCHIVE-141</a>], support from 
friends [<a href="archive/146">ARCHIVE-146</a>], and comments from previous peers [<a href="archive/148">ARCHIVE-148</a>].
</p>

<p>
On the morning of Tuesday 8th November, Mark Verber opened with a 
treatise on how a new "Security Mailing List" could work [<a href="archive/151">ARCHIVE-151</a>], and 
John Markoff had reported in the NYT that "release of virus causes soul-searching
among computer experts" [<a href="archive/154">ARCHIVE-154</a>]. The posting of several 
complete copies of media articles resulted in Gene Spafford stating that "this 
list has two basic topics right now: security and the ethics of the worm 
problem", and that anybody posting copyrighted material would be removed 
from the list. Discussion continued on communication with the media 
[<a href="archive/164">ARCHIVE-164</a>] [<a href="archive/165">ARCHIVE-165</a>] [<a href="archive/167">ARCHIVE-167</a>] and looked at general 
computer security lessons to be learnt from the incident [<a href="archive/166">ARCHIVE-166</a>] 
[<a href="archive/168">ARCHIVE-168</a>]. 
</p>

<p>
Steven Miller posted a "worm chronology, and some other info" [<a href="archive/170">ARCHIVE-170</a>] 
and his pivotal points included: the worm first attempts to enter UMD 
[Nov 2, 10:54PM EST]; Gene Spafford announces the creation of a mailing list 
[Nov 3, 9:20PM EST]; "From the tone of the discussion, it is clear that the 
emergency is over" [Nov 5, afternoon and evening EST]; and "the general 
discussion becomes increasingly fragmented" [Nov 6, evening EST]. 
</p>

<p>
Gene Spafford asked about adding John Markoff (a savvy NYT reporter) to 
the list [<a href="archive/169">ARCHIVE-169</a>]: this request was later rejected by a number of 
participants. Steven Bellovin clarified Robert T. Morris' activities at Bell Labs 
[<a href="archive/177">ARCHIVE-177</a>]. Discussions about source availability continued that evening 
[<a href="archive/178">ARCHIVE-178</a>] [<a href="archive/181">ARCHIVE-181</a>] [<a href="archive/184">ARCHIVE-184</a>] [<a href="archive/183">ARCHIVE-183</a>] [<a href="archive/185">ARCHIVE-185</a>] 
and early into the morning [<a href="archive/186">ARCHIVE-186</a>] [<a href="archive/189">ARCHIVE-189</a>]. In response 
to guidelines for better computer program construction, the warning against 
using "gets()" was highlighted [<a href="archive/179">ARCHIVE-179</a>]. 
</p>

<p>
Neil Gorsuch provided detail about the nature of the zardoz security mailing 
list [<a href="archive/204">ARCHIVE-204</a>]:
<br><table class="descr-quot-table"><tr><td>
[[ I realize that I may be only pointing out the obvious .... There are two 
security lists currently under discussion and I get the feeling that some people 
are talking about them as if we're talking about one proposed list. ]]
And to even further confuse things, there was another security mailing list on 
zardoz (cpd.com), already in place and operating slightly before Andrew Burt 
announced his intended revitalization of the old security mailing list. The 
zardoz list is intended for any system administrator and is probably not going 
to have the same level (and dangerous hints) of material posted in the phage 
mailing list. Certainly no explicit details of breaking security such as a posting 
of the virus source code. 
</td></tr></table>
</p>

<p>
On Wednesday morning, Pete Cottrell continued the debate on source 
availability [<a href="archive/191">ARCHIVE-191</a>]. Matt Crawford thought that "it should be published 
(after about four weeks have elapsed) ..." [<a href="archive/193">ARCHIVE-193</a>], but there were 
other perspectives such needing to know "that most sites have applied 
suitable patches" [<a href="archive/195">ARCHIVE-195</a>]. For other security holes, some needed to 
understand "detailed instructions for exploiting this hole ... to be able to verify 
that [we] have the problem ... before [we] are willing to fix things" [<a href="archive/197">ARCHIVE-197</a>]. 
</p>

<p>
Elsewhere, Peter Denning had been asked about his opinion of distributing 
the worm source code, and provided an enlightened reply [<a href="archive/203">ARCHIVE-203</a>]: 
the ACM policy on "controversial information relative to security" was "simple", 
and saw the balance between the "short term" risk and "long term" gain. For 
others, this abstraction had a concrete reality [<a href="archive/210">ARCHIVE-210</a>]:
<br><table class="descr-quot-table"><tr><td>
ps. the more I read this list, the more concerned I am about network security. 
rtm's worm exploited what I assume is the first of multiple gaping and not-so-gaping
holes in unix security. I fear that the academic/research community 
will, in fixing these problems, endanger the actual security of business 
installations who are dependent on the good business sense of their vendors 
to provide timely upgrades. 
</td></tr></table>
</p>

<p>
What limited code had already been made available was in the process of 
being removed with an iron fist by government agencies. Jeff Smith described 
his experience [<a href="archive/211">ARCHIVE-211</a>], followed by Gene Spafford [<a href="archive/217">ARCHIVE-217</a>]. 
In Gene's case, the NCSC first phoned him, and then took the issue to 
president of the University, who had "leaned on someone else", then they 
phoned Gene back only to find out that the source had been in circulation 
since noon on Friday anyway. Gene was concerned enough to discuss and 
consider his legal position, and to reassure that he would not reveal the 
names of list participants, even though it may ultimately be out of his hands. 
The NCSC "also said they were going to lean *very* heavily on the computer 
companies to provide security upgrades in a very timely fashion". Later, Mark 
Eichin calmed down most of these concerns [<a href="archive/228">ARCHIVE-228</a>]. An enlightened 
treatment on this was given by Theodore Ts'o in the subsequent issue of 
RISKS [<a href="#USENET-1988-11-16">USENET-1988-11-16</a>].
</p>

<p>
A request was made for reports of affected sites as part of a census call 
[<a href="archive/218">ARCHIVE-218</a>], and Gene Spafford asked for participants to help him 
coordinate "a global history of how this thing hit and how we beat it" 
[<a href="archive/222">ARCHIVE-222</a>]. It was revealed that as a result of actual counting, the 
Internet then had about 60,000 hosts [<a href="archive/223">ARCHIVE-223</a>]. Eventually, Gene 
authored one of the major technical reports in the incident [<a href="#RESOURCE-WORM_TR_SPAF">RESOURCE-WORM_TR_SPAF</a>].
</p>

<p>
On Thursday, Andrew Burt announced that "Neil Gorsuch, Mark Verber and I 
are in the process of deciding which of the multitude of lists should be kept 
around ...", but the details of his views were elsewhere [<a href="archive/233">ARCHIVE-233</a>]. 
Incidentally, Martha Rose had uncovered "Internet time" [<a href="archive/243">ARCHIVE-243</a>]. 
</p>

<p>
Near to midnight that Thursday, Gene Spafford announced that "the phage 
list will now go on a temporary hiatus" as it needed some fixing [<a href="archive/238">ARCHIVE-238</a>]. 
There was continued interest in joining the list across Friday [<a href="archive/239">ARCHIVE-239</a>]. 
On Sunday, the "Phage Mailing list [was] Coming Back" [<a href="archive/242">ARCHIVE-242</a>]. 
Gene became the list moderator to "improve the signal-to-noise ratio", 
and clarified appropriate and non-appropriate topics. The list had "160+ 
recipients", eventually reaching more than 300 recipients [<a href="#RESOURCE-WORM_TR_SPAF">RESOURCE-WORM_TR_SPAF</a>].
</p>

<p>
In the mean time, Gene Spafford had also forwarded John Nagle's password 
checker from comp.sources.unix [<a href="archive/240">ARCHIVE-240</a>], and others had verified that 
"UUCP *can* propagate the Worm": details about fixes and a code patch were 
supplied [<a href="archive/246">ARCHIVE-246</a>]. Dennis Ritchie wrote that "those interested in earlier 
works of Robert T. Morris, or interested in network security in general, might 
wish to read" Robert's AT&amp;T Technical Report on a weakness in 4.2BSD Unix 
[<a href="archive/247">ARCHIVE-247</a>]. 
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">CONTINUING THE FOCUS ON WIDER IMPLICATIONS</span>
</p>

<p>
In the week beginning Monday 14th November 1988, the traffic levels on the 
list were declining. Conversation was rambling over various topics, including 
an FBI request for information [<a href="archive/250">ARCHIVE-250</a>], discussion on better mail 
program design [<a href="archive/251">ARCHIVE-251</a>], program bug hunting and configuration 
issues [<a href="archive/254">ARCHIVE-254</a>] [<a href="archive/259">ARCHIVE-259</a>] [<a href="archive/260">ARCHIVE-260</a>], follow-up media 
reports [<a href="archive/255">ARCHIVE-255</a>] [<a href="archive/258">ARCHIVE-258</a>] [<a href="archive/273">ARCHIVE-273</a>], follow-up 
academic/community activities [<a href="archive/257">ARCHIVE-257</a>] [<a href="archive/261">ARCHIVE-261</a>], humour 
[<a href="archive/279">ARCHIVE-279</a>], and an announcement by Gene Spafford about the 
impending availability of his technical report [<a href="archive/268">ARCHIVE-268</a>]. 
</p>

<p>
A number of more general security "holes" were also uncovered [<a href="archive/277">ARCHIVE-277</a>], 
and security aspects of UNIX systems were debated [<a href="archive/283">ARCHIVE-283</a>] 
[<a href="archive/286">ARCHIVE-286</a>]. Keith Bostic attempted to cap a number of these discussions 
in the following week with the suggestion that "UNIX is neither more or less 
secure than any other general purpose operating system I'm aware of" 
[<a href="archive/292">ARCHIVE-292</a>] [<a href="#USENET-1988-11-21">USENET-1988-11-21</a>] [<a href="archive/411">ARCHIVE-411</a>]. A UNIX vendor 
offered an insiders perspective [<a href="archive/291">ARCHIVE-291</a>].
</p>

<p>
On Wednesday 23rd November 1988, Gene Spafford took to reigning in the 
scope of the list [<a href="archive/294">ARCHIVE-294</a>], by stating that
<br><table class="descr-quot-table"><tr><td>
From here the view is that this list isn't for posting anything about security 
flaws in programs unless a simple fix accompanies it. I really don't want this to 
turn into a security mailing list...we've got enough of those already.  This list is 
going to wind down and go away before too long if that is what it becomes.
The reason I'm keeping this list at all is to try to talk about some of the meta-issues:  
what steps do we take to prevent the next worm?  What reactions are 
companies having to all this?  Etc.
</td></tr></table>
He then referred to his message of the previous week [<a href="archive/242">ARCHIVE-242</a>] and 
restated what topics were appropriate or not.
</p>

<p>
On the following Saturday, Gene Spafford again addressed "This group" 
[<a href="archive/301">ARCHIVE-301</a>], and made reference to the availability of other more suitable 
lists for general computer security topics:
<br><table class="descr-quot-table"><tr><td>
Andrew Burt has started to mail things out to his list, and the security list at 
zardoz seems to be alive and well. Specific security holes and fixes should be 
addressed to those lists in the future. If you aren't subscribed to those lists, 
you should consider doing so (could the moderators of those two lists post 
something to this list on how people can join?). 
</td></tr></table>
In the following week, Neil Gorsuch responded with instructions for joining 
"the zardoz security mailing list" [<a href="archive/306">ARCHIVE-306</a>].
</p>

<p>
Gene Spafford's "tech report on the Internet Worm" was "finally finished" and 
announced on Monday 28th November 1988 [<a href="archive/304">ARCHIVE-304</a>]. The list also 
carried various follow-ups about "security hassles" in the aftermath of the 
incident [<a href="archive/308">ARCHIVE-308</a>] [<a href="archive/315">ARCHIVE-315</a>]. 
</p>

<p>
On Friday 2nd December 1988, the list was the proud recipient of a message 
from Russell Brand with the news of CERT's birth [<a href="archive/320">ARCHIVE-320</a>]. It had 
been established by ARPA as "a computer emergency response team" with a 
twenty-four hour number. They were to be "the people to call" when "bad 
things happen", and there were initially six people involved [<a href="archive/325">ARCHIVE-325</a>]. It 
was already clear that the incident was a catalyst for the growth of the field of 
computer security.
</p>

<p>
Otherwise, the occasional sendmail "nasty" was found [<a href="archive/324">ARCHIVE-324</a>]. There 
was news about Robert T. Morris's prosecution [<a href="archive/321">ARCHIVE-321</a>], and a 
clarification by Gene Spafford on the motivation for a suit against Robert T. 
Morris [<a href="archive/326">ARCHIVE-326</a>]. Gene also posted a "Security checklist" [<a href="archive/327">ARCHIVE-327</a>], 
and Russell Brand detailed an incident at LLNL [<a href="archive/332">ARCHIVE-332</a>]. Not 
making the source public remained a contentious issue of debate [<a href="archive/330">ARCHIVE-330</a>] 
[<a href="archive/336">ARCHIVE-336</a>], with the acknowledgement by Bob Page [<a href="archive/337">ARCHIVE-337</a>] that:
<br><table class="descr-quot-table"><tr><td>
we now know that many "cracker groups" have the source code to the Worm. 
I'm sure a half dozen folks within ULowell already have access to the code. It 
upsets me that I have to go to these groups to get the code rather than more 
legitimate channels. It should not be harder for people with white hats to get 
the code. 
</td></tr></table>
This bothered others [<a href="archive/345">ARCHIVE-345</a>]. 
</p>

<p>
Although the incident was over and traffic on the list was waning, it was clear 
that the impact of the incident had yet to subside entirely as "the flood [of mail 
messages hadn't] abated just yet" [<a href="archive/334">ARCHIVE-334</a>]. The list continued to 
discuss various sendmail and ftp issues [<a href="archive/352">ARCHIVE-352</a>]. 
</p>

<p>
On 6th December 1988, Gene restated the purpose of the list [<a href="archive/342">ARCHIVE-342</a>]:
<br><table class="descr-quot-table"><tr><td>
Mel Pleasant pointed out that I stated some time ago that this list was not 
intended to be an ongoing thing. It is still my intent that once the Internet 
seems stable again, and once the security mailing lists crank up (I'm 
supposed to be on both lists and have only seen 2 postings from the isis list 
so far), then this list will probably die out. In the meantime, let me encourage 
you to join the security lists and help them get going with appropriate 
postings. If you want to drop out of this list, please send me mail and say so. 
...
In the meantime, there are many topics that we could discuss, but aren't. 
There are the breakins at Mitre. There are the breakins at LLNL. There were 
the breakins and shut-down of the DEC NE network over Thanksgiving. There 
is the formation of the CERT. 
</td></tr></table>
</p>

<p>
By the 8th December 1988, CERT was already playing an active role, with a 
"Stock message" forwarded to the list suggesting a number of actions to help 
secure systems against "several problems or attacks which have occurred in 
the past few weeks" [<a href="archive/353">ARCHIVE-353</a>]. A reworked version was distributed for 
review later [<a href="archive/358">ARCHIVE-358</a>] because CERT "need[s] to be sure [that it is] 
accurately representing the best information."
 
On 10th December 1988, an announcement was made about the "Three 
Internet worm reports available via FTP" [<a href="archive/357">ARCHIVE-357</a>], followed by an 
update to Gene's paper [<a href="archive/356">ARCHIVE-356</a>] [<a href="archive/359">ARCHIVE-359</a>]. This clearly 
signaled that the not only was the incident itself over but it had been 
thoroughly analysed and scrutinised. On the other hand, it was a sign that 
there was considerable work to be done at a broader level.
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">THE LIST BECOMES A LEGACY</span>
</p>

<p>
From this point onwards, some six weeks after its birth, the list became a 
legacy, consigned to carry the lingering after-effects of the incident. The 
volume of traffic was very low.
</p>

<p>
There were no further messages in December 1988, but this may have been 
the result of technical problems or a focus elsewhere [<a href="#USENET-1988-12-25">USENET-1988-12-25</a>].
</p>

<p>
January 1989 saw a few sporadic messages on topics such as the availability 
of sendmail [<a href="archive/361">ARCHIVE-361</a>], vulnerability in Yellow Pages [<a href="archive/362">ARCHIVE-362</a>], 
requests for historical information about viruses [<a href="archive/366">ARCHIVE-366</a>], and an 
announcement about the "first public release of the Kerberos Authentication 
System" [<a href="archive/367">ARCHIVE-367</a>]. 
</p>

<p>
In February came details about Robert T. Morris' trial [<a href="archive/368">ARCHIVE-368</a>] and a 
new MIT paper on the incident [<a href="archive/371">ARCHIVE-371</a>]. More UNIX bugs had been 
found [<a href="archive/372">ARCHIVE-372</a>]. 
</p>

<p>
During March, a request was made by the Justice Dept. It wanted "to hear 
from system admins who had machines infected" [<a href="archive/373">ARCHIVE-373</a>]. 
</p>

<p>
In April, reports of an investigation into the incident by the "Cornell University 
Commission" arrived [<a href="archive/377">ARCHIVE-377</a>] [<a href="archive/376">ARCHIVE-376</a>]. A "security hole in 386i 
login" had been found [<a href="archive/378">ARCHIVE-378</a>]. 
</p>

<p>
In May, Eliot Lear summarised "Cliff Stoll on the Virus", as Cliff had "appeared 
in front of the Senate Judiciary committee yesterday to testify on the Internet 
Worm incident" [<a href="archive/381">ARCHIVE-381</a>]. On 24th May 1989, Vint Cerf questioned 
some of these conclusions [<a href="archive/382">ARCHIVE-382</a>], and wondered whether Cliff 
would clarify to the list. No clarification was forthcoming: in fact, this was the 
last message on the list. </p>
