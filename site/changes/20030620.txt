Changes in the period from December 2002 to June 2003.

RECENT CHANGES

- Completed substantial recovery and restoration of the Phage List;
    the temporary mailing list established by Gene Spafford during the
    Robert T. Morris Worm emergency of November 1988, including the
    reconstructed list with thread and date indexes, related resources
    including USENET & TCP-IP mailing list references and descriptive 
    overview. Consists of over 400 messages charting real-time unfolding 
    of the crisis and represents an important artifact from the late 
    ARPANET period: as the Worm incident was a catalyst for the 
    maturation of computer security.

- Completed minor analysis on security in the TCP-IP List;
    to look at the increased concern with security between 1982 and
    1991. The TCP-IP mailing list was an important discussion forum
    across the late ARPANET to early Internet period, and many of 
    the participants are pioneers of the medium. The work involves
    analysing frequency and nature of security related discussions.

- Obtained further Zardoz material and resources;
    including references to, and video/audio excerpts from, a 
    recent Australian documentary and articles, and to the original 
    discussion of Zardoz by Phoenix in LoD message base. Further 
    material for this list has also been recovered.
    Available at http://securitydigest.org/zardoz/

- Commenced working on other material and resources:
    including the rutgers 'Security List'.

- Various infrastructure changes;
    including better Search Engine support and page navigation,
    clarification of archive goals / directions, user agent
    compatibility and revised terms and conditions.

PENDING CHANGES

- Analyse and document the Zardoz 'Security Digest' in detail.

- Gather concise references to other related newsgroups/forums,
  such as comp.unix.wizards, comp.unix.bsd, alt.security, 
  comp.security.misc.

- Continued attempts to recover missing material: please help!

I would like to extend my gratitude to Gene Spafford for time and
effort he put into assisting recovery of phage material. I would
also like to thank numerous others who have expressed their support
for this work, and have offered assistance in some form or another.
