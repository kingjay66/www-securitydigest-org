Subject: Something that looks like a new idea for an antivirus virus

  From periodical `New Scientist', 15 Jan 1994, p18:-
  [Virus busters get a shot in the arm] by Jonathan Beard, New York.
  Computers could soon fight off viruses that attack them by using an in-build
"immune system", For a user, this should mean that systems will no longer be
immobilized for hours or days, but will instead fight the virus while
performing other functions.
  Existing antivirus programs are generally managing to stay one byte ahead of
today's equally primitive viruses, which usurp machine facilities and are
designed to try to copy themselves onto other systems. But scientists at IBM
are working on new software that would resemble a biological immiue system to
help networks react more quickly to viral assaults of the future.
  The system would not only identify the virus and repair files that have been
modified, but also send a message to every other computer on the network to
tell them how to destroy the virus.
  Computer viruses are often introduced onto single computers or networks
accidentally from floppy disks. The danger that viruses represent to corporate
data means come companies have made inserting a floppy of unknown origin into
a computer a sackable offence. However, Steve White, manager of IBM's High
Integrity Computing Lab (HICL) in New York, says: "We don't want users
worrying about infecting their computers.
  Today, says White, viruses travel very slowly; even the successful ones take
months or years to become prevalent. Current antivirus products - such as
IBM's AntiVirus 6.1 - are updated to deal with newly recognized viruses each
month or quarter, which is sufficient to deal with this relatively slow
spread. But White warns that in future, millions of users will plug in to
networks and any virus present will spreal extremely quickly, infecting
humdreds or thousands of computers in a matter of minutes or hours.
  At present whenever a new virus is recognised in it quickly distributed
among an informal network of virus collectors - such as those at the HICL -
many of whom work for software companies selling antivirus software. They
dissect the new program to discover how it works, identify its "signature" -
the telltale pattern of bytes it inserts in any file that it modifies in the
infected computer - and add that to antiviral programs' "wanted lists". White
says that cirrent programs recognise about 2000 viruses.
  But this is too slow a process for the world that White envisages. So the
HICL is creating a system that will identlfy viruses, not by comparing their
code to a reference library, but by watching them at work.
  A typical virus seeks out data files that are frequently accessed or
modified because it can use them to infect programs that come into contact
with lots of files. The algorithms being developed at IBM also watch such
files for any sign of tampering, and then begin to create "decoy files" which
are repeatedly accessed (but not altered) to make them attractive to a virus.
If a decoy file grows longer, the system has both caught the virus at work and
its signature.
  The automatic program would then scan the computer for files the virus had
modified, repair them and add the new viral signature to its database. A
message to every other computer in the network would tell them to search and
destroy this virus.
  [With a figure that shows a random network of computers, at first
unaffected, then virus spreads through them, then self-cure and immunity
spread among the infected computers.]]

Subject: Italian Computer Crime Act

As of today, another country has provisions against computer viruses in
its legislation: Italy. A "Computer Crime Act" has been approved by the
Italian Parliament last December 14th. These are its data:

LEGGE 23 dicembre 1993, n. 547
(Gazzetta Ufficiale 30-12-1993, n. 305)

(Law no. 547 passed Dec 23, 1993 - Published on the Official Journal
 no. 305 of Dec 30, 1993)

The new act addresses various issues, including:
  . Damages caused to computers and telecommunication systems;
  . Unauthorized access;
  . Possession and unauthorized diffusion of access codes;
  . Spreading of malicious code;
  . Computer fraud;
  . Wiretapping of data communications;
  . Etc.

I'm not a lawyer, so I can't translate the whole act - I can only
volounteer to e-mail a full copy in Italian to those interested
(it's around 22KB).
However, I have enclosed a tentative translation of the article
dealing with "Computer Viruses", as well as the original text.
If you find the translation inaccurate or plain wrong, feel free
to correct it.

Luca Parisi  -  Rome, Italy.  <mc1980@mclink.it>

**Unofficial translation of Penal Code, art. 615.5**

"Article 615-quinquies of the Penal Code (Spreading of programs aimed
  at damaging or interrupting a computer system).

 Anyone who spreads, transmits or delivers a computer program, whether
 written by himself or by someone else, aimed at or having the effect of
 damaging a computer or telecommunication system, the programs or data
 contained in or pertaining to it, or interrupting in full or in part or
 disrupting its operation is punished with the imprisonment for a term of
 up to two years and a fine of up to It. L. 20,000,000."

Let's look at the following scenario:
An isolated computer (No networking capabilities, all removable media is
not shared with any other computer)
I contend that there exists a virus for this system such that this virus
will infect all files that 'can be' infected without inhibiting their
ulterior execution and then 'dwell' on the system without causing ANY damage
to ANY stored media.
Yes, performance will be affected, but the system will retain all
functionality.
The existence of one such virus will prove your point wrong.
Perhaps with time I will be able to conduct this experiment and
prove my theory.

Let us add some more world perspective to this:
You have an economical and personal interest in making all computer viruses
appear as evil incarnate, you make a living out of this premise, whether
you like it or not.
Let us hear from someone who has no stakes in this matter..

Mistake #1:
This is one of the myths & fantasies about computer viruses and computer
virus authors.
Most virus writers are NOT in their adolescent stage.
Most of them are university students, some are pursuing Master Degrees,
som have PhD degrees.
I have examples to prove my point.
This adolescent nonsense is another scheme by bigwigs with monetary stakes
in the matter to make themselves appear on top of the knowledge heap, which
is in fact not true.

Mistake # 2
Curiosity? Temporary frustation?
How about ridiculing pseudo-professional slick-marketed, poorly
designed products that rip people off their money?
(I am talking about AV software of course..)
Writing viruses is not something you grow out of.. like your clothes
or your hairstyle, as there is nothing to outgrow, as long as there is
dishonest people making money off garbage software, there will be
computer viruses.

oh yeah?
How about software companies that release poorly designed, not properly
tested software, isn't that deviant? (add that to the fact that YOU
are paying for this product)
They KNOW their products are not tested properly and yet they release them!
Just to meet the deadline.
I think you have no idea of what the computer industry is like, your
experience in the matter seems to be minimal, so any judgements like
this one are off base.

PhD's = kids with problems?? Please!
I think anyone who willingly takes somebody's money in exchange for a
scam passed off as quality software is far more criminal than any
virus writer in existence.
Those people are not 'kids with problems'.. they are 'ADULTS with problems'
and far more dangerous!

You have gotten the point wrong.
I am not trying to justify the deed of writing viruses, as this is a very
subjective matter, I am trying to show that viruses CAN be beneficial and
they are not inherently destructive as some will like them to appear.

I would hardly call this thread a 'waste of bandwith', as a matter of fact,
some people think is far one of the most interesting subjects presented
here in a long time.

[related deleted]

IMHO, to turn this into a never ending legalese argument will be of little
use unless we have some people with law background participating.
A commonly accepted technical definition of a computer virus
has yet to be found, where the mathematical terms are precise and sound;
so venturing into legal realms where the terms are very vague and
subjective will make matters even worse.

Subject: Virus Test Laboratory will be founded in Finland

Virus Test Laboratory will be founded at the University of
Tampere and it will be located with the computer science
department. The Virus Test Laboratory will concentrate on testing
anti-viral products. The tests will be made only by the
University of Tampere. Other participants are not allowed to take
any part in testing. The test procedures will be however public.
The Virus Test Laboratory will start its activity in the
beginning of the year 1994. There will be working two researchers
when the activity starts. The responsible researcher will be
Marko Helenius, Master of Science in computer science. Marko
Helenius has made a large research about spread of computer
viruses in Finland. The research has achieved great publicity in
Finland. (The test results will be published in Virus Bulletin
and Virus News International in near future.) The invigilator of
the Virus Test Laboratory will be Pertti J{rvinen, professor of
computer science. There is a real need for the Virus Test
Laboratory, because producers, importers and users (companies) of
anti-viral products wants reliable tests of anti-viral products.

Only PC's anti-virus programs will be tested. Memory resident
scanners will be included in testing. The virus tests will be
made only of programs, which testfee is paid. The testfee can be
paid by importers and producers of anti-virus products or by
other instances. The products will be classified into three price
classes. For the first class products the testfee will be highest
and for the third class products the testfee will be cheapest.
The testfee can be paid by several participants. The salaries of
the Virus Test Laboratory's researchers will be paid by these
payments. No financial profit will be taken by the Virus Test
Laboratory. The testfee will finance two or four tests at a time
(not decided yet). If some of the first or second class products
will not success, the product will be classified as a lower class
product and the testfee will be lowered to respond the testfee of
a lower class product. Also if a second or third class product
begins to success, it will be classified as a higher class
product and the testfee will be heightened to respond the testfee
of a higher class product. The classification of products is only
internal of the Virus Test Laboratory and it will not be
published in test reports.

We will make a rough preliminary test to find out which products
are first class products, which are second class products and
which are third class products. The preliminary test is free of
charges and does not obligate to pay testfee later on. We will
give more information about the first test later on.

The version of anti-virus product, which is wanted to be tested
must be sent to the Virus Test Laboratory within a fixed period.
Otherwise the tests will be made of latest version available for
Virus Test Laboratory.

Number of viruses detected and virus detection speed will be
among testing. The detection speed test will be made in a clean
machine. If possible, we will develop a way to test number of
false alarms caused by anti-virus program. Only properties, which
are possible to measure are tested. No opinions will be allowed
in test reports. Virus Test Laboratory's virus database will
contain about 3000 viruses at the beginning. (All of these
viruses can't be used at the beginning, because we must first
confirm that viruses, that are used are real viruses.) The virus
database will be of course updated later on. The tests are made
only against alive viruses. Each virus will be tested to be a
real and alive virus. The test results and a list of viruses,
which were not detected will be sent to the representatives and
producers of anti-virus programs before publishing the final
results. If they find any errors in testing, they must point out
corrections within a fixed period. If there are real mistakes
that are made by the Virus Test Laboratory's researchers, the
mistakes will be corrected. The test results will be published
four times a year.

Test results, list of viruses, which were not detected and
samples (up to 100 samples, more if needed) of these viruses will
be sent to trustworthy importers or producers of anti-virus
programs. The samples will be password-crypted. The reliability
of importers is confirmed by the producer of tested anti-virus
product. If needed reliability can't be proved, the virus samples
will not be sent. By these security measures wrong use of the
virus samples will be prevented.

The test results will be sent to international newspapers
including Virus Bulletin and Virus News International. Test
results will be available in internet. The test results will also
be available from the Virus Test Laboratory in paper format with
reasonable fee.

So what's the benefit ?

In this world there is no independent virus research center,
which produces regularly test reports of anti-virus products and
which helps anti-virus producers to develop their products.
That's what we are up to. We want to give independent facts about
anti-virus products. We will publish only facts, no opinions like
"It looks pretty, I think it's the best product !" We will give
information like "The product recognised XXX file viruses of XXX
and XXX boot sector viruses of XXX. The product has XX, XX and XX
versions. The XX version was tested. The memory resident portion
of the product recognised XX file viruses of XX and XX boot
sector viruses of XX. It has/has not mouse control. The detection
speed of XX version in a clean machine was XX seconds." It is up
to customers then to decide, which product suits for their needs
best. We want to do the testing as well as it is possible, taking
in consideration every problem, which might false the test
results. The test procedures will be public and tests will be
made so that they can be repeated, if needed.

Now we want to now your interest about this project. We would
especially appreciate comments on testing procedures, virus test-
sets, security measures, virus situation reports and utilities to
help testing.

Often when some "c00l hacker d00d" breaks the copy-protection
on a commercial game (or even just patches out the copyright
notice), he also inserts a message taking credit for the
damage he's done.  From your description, I'd guess that
the copy of the game you're running has been "cracked" in
this way.  Your system problems may be unrelated, or the
"Cyborg" may have done the job badly, and left you with a
buggy game that damages your system.  It might even have
had a Trojan planted in it (somewhat less likely, I'd
say), or even an actual virus.

Have you thought for a minute that you are running an illegally
obtained software?
How do you feel about literally stealing someone's property
and using it for your own benefit?
DO this: call you phone operator and ask for the 1-800 number operator
and ask for the ASP 1-800 number.
Call the number and explain your problem to the person on the phone.
Better yet! call the manufacturer of the game, they will be very interested
in your problems.

With this kind of behaviour it is no wonder that computer viruses
keep on thriving.
It is this kind of idiotic attitude that keeps SYS administrators everywhere
up all night.
(ah, and in case you don't know it by now, you are running an illegally
obtained program, illegally modified by 'Cyborg' )
Erase it before you company gets raided by the powers that be :)

There is a fundamental misunderstanding here.  Just because a virus does
nothing specifically malicious but replicate does not mean that it is
harmless.   For example, if a virus infects a program that does a
self-integrity check, and refuses to run because it has been modified, the
user of that program has been harmed.

He has been denied the ability to use the program, because of the virus,
even though the virus "does nothing but replicate".

By definition a virus has to modify something, and this (unauthorized)
modification may be harmful, even though it is not malicious in intent.

Against my better judgement, I'll reply to ktark's post. Perhaps our tone

> EVERY program modifies the environment in some way,

Viruses modify programs in a way that may be initially unknown to the
'victim' of the attack, without their permission or initiation, and in a way
that often involves some effort on their part to remove. Viruses that manage
to get as far as affecting a file have done some damage, in terms of the time
spent investigating and curing them, before any active destruction such as
disk trashing has occurred.

A program initiated by a user, for the purposes of the user, or a program
that facilitates that user's actions, in a predetermined way, certainly

Send me references and I will. However, I still stand by my point, that

Okay, so I wasn't very rigorous in my English. Substitute:
supporting the perpetuation of viruses, and their continued creation by a
group of people called virus writers.

Could you list these, along with their effects? What I'm getting at is, by
attacking a computer, a virus is exhibiting spurious behaviour. Regardless of
what that behaviour is.

Are there no known examples of predators killing at a distance, before getting
the spoils of their actions? The virus writer's kill may be different to the
lion's prey, but I'm sure some writers would like to think of themselves as
'hunters', with 'systems' their prey.

Chicken and egg time. Certainly, some class of people may rely on publicity

See above. Do you welcome, with open arms, any virus attack you receive? Or
do you quietly tut-tut to yourself, then set about removing the infestation?
You also take my word 'dangerous' as related to the writer/vector, and attach
it to a virus. That may or may not be appropriate, but is not indicated by my
question.

I see a man with a loaded gun, pointed at me as dangerous. Or a drunk-driver
on the same road as me. I see a virus vector, with an infected disk in one of
my systems, as dangerous. I see a virus writer, writing a virus for PCs (my
realm of experience), as dangerous.

A drunk-driver, without a car, will not kill someone by driving into them. He
may still stab them, say, if that is his wont. I'm saying that the virus
vector can't harm my machine by viral attack, without possessing a virus. He
may still attack it with paint stripper, say.

> >Without the vector, the virus is still, potentially, dangerous.

The existence of certain 'things' even without their use, is dangerous. The
potential exists. The initial writer of a virus may be a wonderful (wo)man,
but their writing of a hazardous virus has increased this potential. viz the
Arms race. Was the world in the 60s/70s/80s free from fear of destruction by
atomic weapons? Were any used in this period? The obvious difference is that
viruses are being 'used', and some destruction is also taking place.

Alright, so which stage of a virus event causes the damage? And does that
stage depend on any other stages occurring? Be as logical as you like, and
tell me that a virus attack does not require a virus.

Is maintenance of the status quo, re virus legislation, your avowed

'change the world'. So why not this little bit of it?

Again, post-modern, but useless. The world is not driven by 'pure' logic. If
you think it is you've been reading too many mathematics and logic books. Try
as people might to suppress it, most do have a sense of right and wrong, I'd
have thought a logician such as yourself would be very keen on the concept of
True and False. My concept of wrong in this issue may be skewed, but I
suspect that a majority of computer professionals and users would concur, at
least in part. You obviously don't, and I'm interested in the reasons (beyond
logic) that lead you to your conclusions. Do you agree with your idea of
logic, or are you the sort who likes to argue one thing, and believe another.
Or is logic enough for you, in all aspects of your life? Philosophical, man.

Doing a FDISK /MBR will replace the master boot record with a new copy and

bios into accepting it.  Or if you had an OS2/DOS/UNIX multiple boot

TBAV is an excellent product. What TBUTil does is a couple of things. It
can store your hard disk's vital areas, the boot record and partition
table, along with your cmos settings to a floppy disk. Then at a later
time, TBUTIL can compare your backup copy to the original and notify you
if anything has changed.  If so it can resotre it to exactly the way it was.

It also has an option to replace the partition with its own anti-virus
partition, as you mention. ANd it can also make a similar anti-virus boot
sector on your floppy disks.

The Norton Utilities also have a couple of tricks. A rescue disk can be
made using the Norton Utilities, which stores those key parts of your hard
drive to a floppy.

And also, the Norton utiltiy IMAGE, which is similar to the dos MIRROR
command, will store a copy of the MBR, Partition table, as well as a copy
of the fat and root directory. IMAGE places this at the very end of the
hard drive so it will most likely be there unless the entire drive is
formatted. Image info is used by UNERASE and UNFORMAT. Since it is on the
hard drive it is not as secure as the other methods.

and it was supposed to defeat it.  I did not confirm that at the time.

I am not interested in data on CPAV, but I AM interested in any security

Is there some flaw which makes MSAV easily defeated?  I would not want

We've had a problem here with FORM, although thanks to Cheynnes anti
virus software and a lack of hard disk PCs we've managed to keep it
under control.

The virus is one of the most common - I believe it was distributed on
a major software suppliers application disks and hence got a foothold.
It is reasonably infectious, infecting boot sectors on floppys and the
partition on hard disks. It goes memory resident when an infected disk
is used with a PC and checks other disks as they are used, infecting
them if not already contaminated.

Clearing it off isn't a major problem - Cheynnes stuff or Dr Solomons
Toolkit both work (as would most others I expect). We've never has a
problem afterwards on a hard disk athough the odd floppy has had its
boot sector corrupted beyond repair.

If not detected it will cause an apparent fault with the keyboard.

Hope this helps. Don't worry TOO much - it's not a particulaly nasty
virus - but it is annoying and difficult to get rid of.

A follow-on poster in VIRUS-L (which I apparently haven't kept) pointed
out that the "Abort" option would abort the program issuing the write
request, which could result in loss of data (e.g. when you try to save
the working-file from a word processor, or from an editor. Now my advice
is:
- - Exert the "Abort" option when you have issued the offending write
  request from the command prompt (e.g. an XCOPY command),
- - exert the "Ignore" option when you have issued the offending write
  request from inside an application program (e.g. a word processor)
  -- BEWARE: I have not tested this variant! --,
- - never exert the "Retry" option for a write request!

Are you sure that the message says "shareware"?

This looks a lot like the DOS error message which says, "SHARE must
be loaded for large media."  SHARE.EXE is loaded via the CONFIG.SYS
file and its purpose is to handle file-sharing in operating
systems like Windows.  Check your DOS book for more info.

   2. Boot up from a previously prepared write protected Boot_Floppy.
   3. You can use the appropriate virus cleaner [TBAV-TBUtility], [and
      with DOS 5 or higher; FDSIK /MBR command] or [DOS Sys Command] or,
      [McAfee MDisk] to restore the boot sector.
   4. RESCAN with a Virus Scanner on a write protected Floppy.
   5. Don't forget to scan ALL floppys that have come in contact with
      the infected PC and be sure to warn others to whom you may have
      sent infected floppys.

Was the message actually "SHARE should be loaded for large media"?
This message is printed by various versions of DOS that don't
include built-in support for large partitions (usually >32M).
If you have a partition greater than 32M, you shoud load SHARE
in CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT (see your DOS manual for details).
Or, better, you should upgrade your version of DOS!  Probably
not a virus...

We know of a virus like that, apparently rather widespread in Spain.
It is 1310 bytes long, infects COM and EXE files that are executed,
and on January 5th it displays the message "Virus BARROTES por
OSoft", and overwrites the master boot record of the first hard
disk.  IBM AntiVirus should be able to detect it correctly, if
that is indeed the virus you're dealing with; of course, you
may have encountered a variant with different behavior.  We call
the strain that we have seen "Barrotes-1310".

I'm trying to locate a scanner called `AVscan' which a friend described as "a

Unfortunately, he doesn't remember where he saw (about) it.  Anybody know if

Subject: Other antivirals - change detectors (CVP)

BEGPANB.CVP  931111

                Other Antivirals - Change Detectors

If your "generic" antiviral is a change detection program, then you
will probably have a much better idea of what is infected, although
less idea of how.  Change detectors will usually tell you that the
boot sector, or master boot record, or a specific file has been
changed.  Sometimes, in the case of a stealth virus, it will not be
able to "see" any change on the disk, but will report a change in
memory of the interrupts.

Activity monitors usually run all the time, and so, in addition to
sometimes telling you, specifically, what type of action is being
done, they generally give you some clues by catching something as it
happens.  Change detectors are usually run at set intervals, often
at boot time, and so only report after the fact.  However, because
change detection software identifies specific objects, you will
generally get more information from them about boot sector infectors
than you will get from activity monitors, and boot infectors are
much more common.

As with activity monitors, if the antiviral identifies a file that
you can easily replace, copy it off and replace it.  If a change
detector shows only one file changed, then it is highly unlikely
that any other files are infected.  If a cluster of files are
changed, particularly in one directory, then the chances are very
good that you do have a real infection.

However, like activity monitors, change detectors are subject to
false positive alarms.  If you have made changes to WordPerfect,
SETVER or another program, these will generate alerts from change
detectors.  If you upgrade your DOS version, the boot sector will
change.  If you repartition the disk, the master boot record will
change.

If, therefore, it is inconvenient to replace the modified program,
or if the boot sector appears to be infected, then you may have to
do the same types of investigations as were outlined for activity
monitors.  Since boot sector infectors are more likely to be
identified here, trying to trap an infection on a floppy disk is
more important.  If you have two different sized floppy disks, then
format two new disks, one for each.  Label each as to whether it is
drive A: or B: on the computer.  Copy some files onto them, and take
several directory listings.  If you have utility software, try to
look at the boot sectors of the floppy disks.  The reason for all
this activity is that one must try to force the virus to infect the
disk, and this is not always as easy as it sounds.

Also, if a boot sector infector is identified, recovery is not quite
as simple as replacing a file.  Boot from a system disk that is
known to be free from infection.  If you cannot access the hard disk
at this point, do not try anything further.  If the hard drive is
readable, then do a SYS C: command (if the boot sector is changed)
or an FDISK /MBR (if the master boot record has been altered).  This
should fix the problem, but you will also need to check *all*
diskettes for infection.

BEGPANC.CVP  931111

                         3.3 Local Reports

If you hear reports of a virus in your particular area, be cautious,
but don't panic.  As I write this, there have been a great many news
reports of the formidably named SatanBug virus.  This is perhaps
more widespread than some because of the activity of virus exchange
bulletin boards, but got much more press than it warranted because
of reports from Washington, DC.  In the same way, we have recently
been inundated with reports of "Stoned 3" and "Stoned 4":  these are
the names given by a particularly widely distributed (though not
particularly good) scanner to a wide variety of viral variants and
even false alarms.

However, it is true that virus infections tend to happen in
clusters.  Therefore, if there are a lot of validated reports of one
particular infection in your area, then it is best to be careful.
Make sure that you have a program which is either effective in
preventing, or will correctly identify, this specific virus.  It is
a good idea to get accurate information about the virus:  what does
it infect, what are the exact symptoms, how does it behave, and is
there any information you can check to determine that you do *not*
have the virus.  In this latter category, during the months leading
up to March of 1992, we were able to advise people who were worried
about the Michelangelo virus to use CHKDSK.  This simple utility
checks the files and space on the disk, but it also gives a report
on the memory.  For most machines (although not all) it should
report "Total Memory" as being 655360 bytes.  If it does, then you
do *not* have the Michelangelo virus.  You may, of course, have
something else.

Try to find out all you can about the distribution and spread of the
virus, as well as any technical details.  The more people have been
hit whom you know, the more risk there is to you and your system.
If, on the other hand, only machines in lawyers' offices are being
hit, and you don't know or deal with any lawyers (and who does, if
they can help it?), then you are probably at lower risk.  Not no
risk, but lower.

Try to assess the source of the reports.  Recently the Clinton
administration health plan was distributed to interested parties and
the media on disk.  Almost immediately a newswire report was issued,
and got almost universal coverage, stating that the disks were
infected with a virus.  (The mythical but ubiquitous "Stoned 3," as
it happened.)  When the dust had cleared, it turns out the *only*
report was from one reporter -- who happened to work for the
newswire service.  He had infected his machine and "decided" that
the only source could have been the Clinton disk.  (I must admit
that this report caught me out, too.  You can't be too careful.)
