While Vesselin makes some very good points, this does not mean that *all*
integrity management programs are so limited. Pardon me if I use my own
software (DS II) to illustrate.

In the Brain example above, the virus infects from a floppy boot. A management
system can protect in two ways - by preventing floppy boots in the first
place (and providing a means to boot from floppy *after* the management software
is in place if necessary), and by preventing the virus (and incidently DOS)
from gaining access to the hard disk should the first line of defense fail.

His second point is also not necessarily true either. After DS II loads it
prevents writes to the MBR, hidden sectors, and DBR and prevents formatting
(BIOS level) of any part of the disk. If desired this can be extended
to any partition or a whole disk. This stops all low-level viruses and
droppers that I know of before the fact. It is possible to detect and
block the act of infection, not just "after the fact".

This leaves the possibility of a "directed attack" and, by the nature
of a "single-state" machine comes under the "Turing Halting Problem".
True, solutions are possible (my "bypass" program illustrates one), but
so far I have not seen a real implimentation of this.

The solution is a separate program that can be invoked periodically to
validate operation of the program and to verify that "tunneling" has
not occured. (Of course this also brings up separate second-generation
problems such as QEMM "stealth" and 32BitDiskAccess - not insurmountable
just different.)

This story was reported in NY Newsday.
As usual, the reporters didn't do their homework, but oh, well
what can you expect if even people who write for WIRED still think
that the military used a the 'printer virus' in Desert Storm!!
(WIRED #2)

This is part of the circle of ignorance around computer viruses
drawn by several people with economical stakes in the matter, (they shall
remain  nameless.)  :)

This is the scoop: Mr. Lafaro is a computer consultant.  He did some
programming work for the furniture company in Westbury NY.  He was not
paid the entire amount for his work by the company.  He decided to
send his techie and install a time bomb that would have unabled the
usage of his program displaying a message saying that his program
would remain unaccessible until he was paid the remaining money for
his services.  Mr. Lafaro felt guilty and decided to warn the company
about the time bomb.  The company contacted the police.  Chaos
followed and countless idiotic reporters distorted the news.

This is a very interesting story as there is no clear cut rights or
wrongs.
Mr. Lafaro was defending his code.
He might not have had legal access to his clients computers but he does
have legal rights over his code.
Interesting questions arise...
I see lawyers everywhere... ;)

Subject: Military implications of computer viruses (Theory & Practicalities)

Hello all,

After having come across so many articles which have mentioned the use
of "non-lethal" methods of combat whereby the military authorities
have decided to employ the replication code into enemy defence
installation in order to render the opposition intergrated electronic
defence network useless.

Rumour was rife during Desertstorm that the allied units had used some
type of this system to bring down the iraqi electronics system to its
knees. Well it is pretty clear that it was just a hoax.  However,
considering the possibility that most countries in the world tend to
import their defence equipment especially electronics the
probabilities that the backdoors in all these systems might be used to
house these deliberate bugs inside them thus bring this type of
conflict into being a reality. To illustrate the last statement with
an example from Desert Storm; the iraqi airforce Mirage F1C fighters'
air-air combat radar systems had certain deliberate flaws whose
details were handed over to the allied forces in order to turn the
tables around. One has to keep in mind that we are assuming that the
basis of the electronic network is the integrated chip and not the
vaccuum tube technology quite a lot of which is in use by the Russian
forces.

Avid followers of Star Trek might recall that the in the episode
called "Borg" a similar method was considered inorder to destroy a
civilization comprising of compu-organic beings. The trick was to give
insert an unsolvable problem which would increase in complexity once
an analysis was begun by a borg, more and more resources would be
diverted to solving it leading the slow destruction of the
civilization. One would wonder as to what the replicating mechanism
would be. Borgs civilization does not comprise of individual but
masses of groups who are constantly involved in group thinking. The
trick here was that the Borg would be returned to its hive and the
collective thought process would distribute the puzzle cum virus thus
crumbling the civilization. A pretty clever notion.

A parallel could be drawn to the internet worm whose actions were in a
way related to draining the resources of the infected machine by
wasting the time replicating the code. However the internet worm did
demonstrate the ability to move across certain types of platforms. The
similar method would be the basis upon which the military application
would work.  It is a fact that all, if not most military electronic
equipment are capable to interfacing with each other based upon a
standardised protocol.  This could be very well be exploited to great
detail.

Questions are definitely going to arise relating to how the virus
would survive; would there be only one virus or several whereby each
pertaining to a specific equipment but all able to relate to one
another; what the trigger mechanism would be; or may it be called a
trojan rather than a virus waiting to be activate and etc.

It is clear that there is a new frontier opening up in any advance
armed force as part and parcel of the electronic warfare section. Gone
are the days when jamming ,elint and sigint formed the fundamental
keys in electronic warefare. This means that this new type of warefare
play an equal if not more of a role in the future thus being a force
multiplier.

PS: I would appreciate any comments on this matter. I am working on a
paper outlining the future of this type of warfare ie. its merits,
flaws and possible repurcussions on society as a whole given the fact
that it is just a program and as we all know that there is no perfect
program.

Sincerely
Sajid

Subject: Liabilities again

Hi all,

I was preparing recently two lectures about computer viruses, one for the
students, the other for the people in business/industry. Although one could
say it is one and the same text, I would say it is not. First, the students
wanted to know everything about, say that, technical side of viruses, what
are the new trends in virus writing and a-v protection, they were willing to
exchange viruses with me after the course, etc. Might be that some of them
will try to write a virus from pure curiosity. The other lecture is something
else, of course. The people from business/industry using PCs will probably
prefer (I didn't keep that lecture yet) to know what is the extent of damage
virus can do and what is the best way of protection. They certainly will not
be interested in how to write viruses, but rather in how to remove them and
repair eventual damage.

It brings me to the recent discussion about liabilities. Many arguments and
"arguments" were done pro and con good/bad usage of viruses and good/bad
guys. I would say we should see first who is who in whole story and what
viruses we are talking about actually.

1. I assume that most of discussions on this forum are referred to
"population" of PC viruses created in last 5 years (roughly). The operating
system concerned is DOS (maybe the discussion can be extended to Novell
Netware environment). In further text they will be called viruses.

2. Bad (or "bad") guys/girls. I don't have precise sociological analysis what
kind of people (age, profession, degree of education, etc.) write viruses and
establish Virus Exchange BBS'. From my (incomplete) knowledge, I would say
that most of them are students in their adolescent age (probably not very
different from students attending my speech). About their motives to write
and exchange viruses they may be: curiosity, temporary frustration by
somebody or something (e.g. professor in school), usual tendency of young
people in adolescent age to oppose to everything and everybody, i.e. to
behave as rebels (it is normal stage when somebody is growing up, but as soon
as we get out from this stage we forget it), etc. The exchange of viruses I
see as normal wish to exchange software among the members of the same group
of software authors/users. Maybe it could be said that those people are
slightly deviant, because they probably know that some viruses can cause
damage in some environments and some of them write viruses with intention to
make a damage, e.g. by destroying data. However, I don't dare to classify all
of them as criminals. Not yet. The most I can say that they are irresponsible
or simply "kids with problems" (whatever is their real age).

3. Victims - those are wide group of people using PCs. I agree that in some
environments just appearance of a virus on some PC can cause significant
damage. The most cited example is virus writing message on the screen of PC
in the hospital life-support environment. In some company the loss of
important data may be catastrophic. On the other hand some computer hobbyist
may find presence of virus on his PC amusing and keep it as a "pet virus".
Not every PC user is equally "endangered" by computer viruses, which is often
neglected. When talking about damage one could state the environment and
degree of damage in that environment.

4. Good (or "good") guys/girls - people producing anti-virus products or
dealing in some way with anti-virus stuff (research, evaluation of a-v
products, hobby, etc.). Their reasons for doing such a job are probably in
the greatest extent to make a profit from their products/evaluations/
research. Then it could be interesting field of research for getting an
academical degree. Some of reasons to choose right this field might be as in
the first group of "bad" guys/girls, i.e. frustrations of different kind. I
would say there is no special reason to call this group of people "good".
Those are simply people doing their job.

Well, after all we should look what is the virus/anti-virus picture today.
Maybe I will oversimplify, but roughly it is: "good" guys/girls are fighting
against "bad" guys/girls to protect "victims" (or more exactly "poor innocent
victims"). Is that really so? Or maybe, the question is : who has use from
that picture?

On the first place - a-v producers, because it is the part of marketing, i.e.
exaggerations in representation of "virus danger" sell the product better.
Of course, other a-v people (including me) also can find this picture usable
to justify (and charge) their work. In some extent, the virus writers have
also satisfaction in the period when they are dealing with virus writing
because they get a kind of "negative glory" (never mind, for adolescent
person looking for confirmation of his/her immature ego, glory is glory -
some mystification, as using false names, add to it more flavour). All this
noise is also useful to future generation of real criminals who can learn a
lot (not only about viruses, but also about still inadequate legislation),
while being in background and keeping quiet.

Who has disadvantage from this picture? Well, mostly the "victims" who can
only be confused with heaps of information/disinformation about computer
viruses and anti-virus products. They usually get an exaggerated and chaotic
picture about how viruses can be dangerous and how bad are person writing
them, while any a-v product is represented as salvation. What they don't get
from articles in newspapers, courses, advertisements and possibly from this
forum is real information about how to protect -their- systems in -their-
working environment and what is real degree of danger in -their- environment,
not in some general space/time/society.

Of course, minority of researchers who dare to think that viruses can be used
for something useful (not defining now what is really useful) have
disadvantage from the statements of kind "all viruses are bad, because they
exist". [Yes, Karl, I agree with you in some points, only don't know what is
the purpose of your arguing. If you really want to point that not -all-
viruses will cause damage in -all- environments and if you have wish to do
some serious work, as e.g. a study of epidemiology, I will be glad to help
you in that and explain how to investigate such things in isolated and
controlled environment. But, if you only want to justify writing of viruses
for which you know that are harmful in some environment and to provoke people
here, then you are nothing more than just another frustrated kid, making
noise and it would be better to stop wasting bandwidth here. You decide what
you want to be.]

What are the final conclusions? To stop unnecessary wasting of bandwidth with
discussions who are "bad"/"good" guys/girls and if viruses can be good or
bad, I propose to turn back the discussion to the question of virus
definition. This time from the legal point of view. I announced some time ago
the contest for the best virus definition in different categories. While
response in technical categories was more than good, the response in ethical
and legal categories was almost zero. [I would like to thank to everybody who
participated, to technical jury for their hard work, and to apologize to
those who asked me what happened with the contest - I will present the
results in the near future, I hope]. As I can see from discussions here the
legislative/ethical problems with viruses are still actual. I don't dare to
discuss ethical problems in detail, because I feel that ethics is fairly
subjective for every individual, dependent on his/her education, culture,
country, etc. Anyway, I am still interested in legal problems. Few laws I
have seen are in my opinion still vague. What I see as a serious flaw in that
subject is non-existent cooperation between technical people and lawyers in
defining "malicious software". I think that it should be stated precisely
where (in which environment), when (in which time, e.g. specific working
hours) and why some software (virus or not) is causing a damage. Also, what
degree of damage is punishable (losing important data in the bank is not the
same as losing games or letters on some PC at home, although they can be
caused by the same piece of software). Then, what can be used as an evidence
on court (on damaged computer the traces can be lost) and so on. When having
a clear definition, it is easier to conclude who is responsible for the
damage, whether the person spreading/entering such a piece of software or the
person who wrote it. I hope some questions will be answered here.

Subject: "Good Viruses?"

It's been quite a while since I last fealt compelled to post to Virus-L,
but I thought that recent discussions regarding the legality of viruses
and liability were interesting enough that I'd like to jump back into the
fray.  There has been much discussion on how common large-scale network
infections are.  I would say that they probably happen to a large corporation
at least twice before they are effectively controlled.  My own experience
has included infections of 4 servers, 8 servers, 11 servers, and 4 servers.
The viruses encountered were (in order) Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Pegg, and
a mixture of Jerusalem (primary), 4096, Green Caterpillar, and Copyright
respectively.  In the last two infections (11 servers and 4 servers) I merely
list the number of infected servers; however, it is noteworthy that in
determining the extent of the infection and in recovering from the viruses over
30 servers had to be checked in the first case and 40 in the second.  During
the scanning procedure an enormous number of users had to be shut out of
applications to prevent them from potentially being infected and to prevent
(in some cases) the re-infection of the network applications by users.  Each
of these events took over a day to completely recover since even after the
network is cleaned, each individual workstation has to be checked for
potential infection (this can be done in an automated fashion, but not if
the virus is a "fast-infector" and is likely to be RAM resident as is the
case with Pegg).  Once a virus is found on an individual workstation, one
must take the time to personally visit the workstation to ensure that it
is cleaned properly, and that diskettes are scanned to ensure against
re-infection.  All this takes time, costs money, and reduces the capability
of employees using the network to get work done.  Additionally, in the cases
I have sited, we would generally agree that the viruses mentioned are (for
the most part) benign (Jerusalem and 4096 can cause problems, but only under
certain conditions).  So, if these viruses are benign, then (with the
exception of Jerusalem) they are not destructive right?  Wrong!  How many of us
would be willing to say "Well, we are infected with the Pegg virus, it's
benign, so we'll just accept it and not bother to dis-infect the system."?
No one!  Therefore, we have to waste time to disinfect any virus that enters
our environment.  Worse, if we have a large inter-connected network and people
detailed to still other sites, we have to spend a large amount of time just
scanning to find perhaps one infected file.  How long does it take to scan
a gig drive?  How about 40?  How about 500 hard-drives in 500 PCs?  Get the
picture?  It's expensive!  500 users down for about a day and a half,
system administrators pulling overtime and wasting entire days scanning
drives and servers.  Were talking about 10's of thousands of dollars.  We
estimate that one infection we encountered were over 500 users were affected,
11 servers, (30 having to be checked), 120 PCs actually found infected,
down-time 1.5 days cost a low of $70,000 to a high of $140,000 in time spent,
overtime, lost productivity, and recovery.  So, what is the moral?
Network infections do happen, and I would suspect that many corporations have
had them although they obviously have a disincentive to talk about them.  They
will likely happen only about twice before adequate procedures are in place.
If a new virus gets by a scanner, these infections will happen at least two
more times before additional procedures are put in place.  There is NO SUCH
THING AS A NON-DESTRUCTIVE VIRUS, PERIOD!!!!!  If even the most benign virus
gets out of the lab, it's a problem.  Who's liable?  The distributor of the
virus, can you find him/her?  Even if I do put a disclaimer, there is such a
thing as strict liability, and even if it is not applicable to software like
computer viruses, you can disclaim all liability, but this does not mean that
you do not have any liability!  I hope this adds some real-world perspective
to the discussion.

Subject: Ripper virus alert/warning (PC)

Here at LBS over the last 2 weeks, we have been eradicating
a relatively new virus called (Jack_The_)Ripper. The virus
got through our defences. Apparently it is confined mostly
to the UK at present. It is also known to the virus newsgroups.

As far as we know, it lives in the boot sector of floppies
and hard disk partition tables, and infects four DOS files :-

FORMAT.COM
SYS.COM
MORE.COM
UNFORMAT.COM

We think it tries to appear innocuous until the sixteenth
reboot, when it will reformat your hard drive. At the
moment, we are only aware of these anti-virus packages which
will detect and/or disinfect effectively:

F-PROT
Dr Solomon's Anti-V Toolkit

Our procedure at present for detection/prevention is
something like.

1. Run F-Prot in full screen mode and clean master boot sector.

2. Run Cleanpar from Dr Solomon Toolkit to repair partition.

3. Make sure autoexec.bat loads Guard and Findviru.

4. Use Dr Solomon's CLEANBOO to clean floppies.

NB CPAV does not detect Ripper at present.

Subject: Possible Windows-specific virus (PC)

I started up Windows 3.1 this morning to find that it could read no
group configuration files except the one for Games -- it claimed that
the others were corrupted.  In a fit of pique I deleted the entire
Windows directory (I had little in there apart from what came on the
Windows floppies) and tried to re-install -- the installation failed.
I installed the anti-virus software from IBM's PC-DOS 6.1: running
IBMAVD gave the message "Stack overflow!" and IBMAVSP hung after the
initial banner.  On reboot, CONFIG.SYS was full of errors, some being
reported on impossibly-large line numbers.  Changing the STACKS line
in CONFIG.SYS didn't cure the stack-overflow message.

I had recently bought a new SCSI drive, so I booted the machine off the
old one, installed the PC-DOS antivirals, and scanned both the old disk
and the putatively infected one -- nothing showed up.

The only Windows code that I think could be the source of an infection is
a version of Wintach that was posted, uuencoded, to one of the comp.ms-windows
groups -- from an Italian site, if memory serves.  I haven't run any other
Windows freeware or shareware except the xnot emacs and some ET4000 drivers.

I use Thunderbyte for scanning(the speed can't be beat), but for my TSR I
use Virstop.  It's much simpler just to put Virstop /warm /boot in my
config.sys than load tbdriver, and 3 or 4 other utilities...

Besides, on my 286 virstop uses less memory than anything else.

I wouldn't mind finding out exactly how the signatures in Virstop are
chosen, though... are they basically the Quickscan signatures?  A mix of
Quickscan and Heuristic signatures(or rules, in the latter case I suppose)?

Anyways, considering that I view my TSR as merely the first line of
defense, used mostly to prevent accidents due to carelessness(forgetting
to scan, for instance...), I consider Virstop the product that best
meets my needs.

Hi folkes;

My fiance purchased a second-hand PC clone that came with
CPAV loaded.

For curiousity's sake she used the IMMUNIZE option.
Now the machine will not boot-up off the hardrive.

We don't have any CPAV documentation and the online help
files are missing.

The machine is running MS-DOS 5.0; no windows.

I've checked datemarks on the dos files: COMMAND.COM,
IO.SYS, and MSDOS.SYS.  They do not appear to have been
updated.  Also CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT seem to have
no unusual contents.

Any suggestions?

I used scan109 and F-prot 2.10c to detect the virus.  F-prot

booted a clean version of MSDOS6.2 from the floppy and
attempted to run F-prot, but it won't recognize the existence

It's a bug in InVircible.
When CPAV/TNT "immunize" a file,it appends a short CRC checking code to it, and
 a 5 bytes MSDOS sig, to fool some virus (a variant of Jerusalem, as far as I
 remember). When the scaning module of InVircible detects a file with the
 CPAV/TNT "immunization" code, it removes that MSDOS sig automatically, without
 asking for user confirmation, without any notification and without even
 updating its own signatures database. Naturally, the next time you scan that
 directory, all "immunized" files will be 5 bytes shorter. Just regenerate
 the signatures for that directory, and you should have no more problems with
 it.

Greetings All,

I'm a microcomputer technician with Academic Computing at the University
of Wisconsin-Oshkosh.  We recently encountered the "RIPPER" virus, both
in student IBM PC labs and shared student/faculty machines.

The only software that was able to detect and clean this virus was F-PROT
2.10C (December 1993.)  It should be noted that this virus infected both
bootable and _non-bootable_ fixed and floppy disks.

"Ripper" shows up in F-PROT's listing of new viruses, but there's no
information available on it.

Does anyone have any information/experience with this particular virus?
What damage does it do (Besides mess with Windows 3.1's 32-bit disk access)?
Is it a time bomb?  If, so when does it "detonate?"

We have stumbled across a 'false positive' when using the /A
option with SCAN 109 on PC's with IBM DOS 3.3. This may also
affect other 3.3 versions of MS-DOS and it's derivatives.

The 'false positive' is the MODE.COM file, and SCAN 109 reports
that it contains the 1008-B Dropper [1008Drop] virus.

If the /A (Scan ALL Files) switch is not used no 'false positive'
is experienced.

This has been reported to McAfee in the States, but, they say they
have not had this 'bug' reported previously. They also mentioned
that they had NOT tested 109 on a PC with IBM DOS 3.3.

This caused a serious problem for our company, as upto 500 users
will be told their PC is infected by a virus.

!!! BE WARNED !!!

I hope this will stop others having problems with 109.

TO:ALL

A. PADGETT PETERSON was heard to say to ALL on 12-13-93:

AP>Once more I am seeing an incredible number of people talking about
AP>not being able to use FDISK/MBR for MBR viruses (usu because they
AP>still do not have DOS 5) and SYS not working for floppies. This is
AP>exactly why  I wrote the FixMBR/FixMBR pair of FREEWARE programs (now
AP>in FixUtil6). True  there are other commercial versions (with the
AP>logo of the purchaser and some other options) but the basic
AP>capability is there for the effort of a downloaded .ZIP.

Could you explain in non-technical terms what these utilities do? I know
how to use FDISK, and FDISK /MBR, but I'm not exactly  certain what the
MBR contains. I *believe* it contains the boot sector and the partition
table, but since I've never worked with these manually with an editor
for any reason, I wouldn't know one if it was in front of me. I take it
that FixMBR will save the MBR and can restore it from an archived copy.
>From the documentation, it looked like it was replacing the MBR (or the
boot sector?) with its own record, and you saved a copy of the original
off line. Is that correct? One question then is can you restore the
original MBR, i.e., remove FixMBR to leave the system as if it had never
been installed, or if you restore the MBR, are you restoring the MBR
modified with the installation of FixMBR. If there was nothing wrong
with the system, and you simply did FDISK/MBR, would the system be
restored to its original state?

A similar question is do you know what TBAV's TBUTIL does? It *sounds*
like its doing something similar, but I don't know if its doing the same
function. I know if you install TBUTIL, when you boot, you get a message
giving the results of its internal checking of the modified boot sector,
and after it checks ok, then you get the message "Starting MS-DOS".
There is also the provision to remove the modified boot sector through
either its own utility or with FDISK/MBR. Is this similar to what FixMBR
is doing, in what its modifying?

I'd rather know exactly what the different available utilities do before
choosing one and using it, and certainly before I *have* to use it to
restore a system. Since I've been hit by a virus before, and lost a
logical partition to it in its removal several years ago (Stoned on a
system using MS-DOS 3.3 and Disk Manager partitioning), I know how
valuable recovery information is before the fact.

AP>Along the same lines DiskSecure II v2.4 should be out this weekend
AP>with a major change: It will now be free to individuals (though a
AP>postcard would be  nice) and otherwise available only on a site
AP>licensing basis. See the .DOCs for details.

What does DiskSecure II do, and where could I find it? Even though I'd
seen messages on FixMBR for some time, I never saw it on any BBS until
about a week ago. I'd prefer a dial-in BBS rather than an FTP site if
you know of one, as my internet access is through UUCP and I only have
message access.

(a) goes for all anti-viral software, whether it is a Scanner, IC,
monitor or anything else. A software-only solution can always be
bypassed if targeted. It does not help to combine all known anti-viral
techniques, as long as it is a applied in software alone, so I don't
understand Bontchev's point here.

(b) is a safe assumption since integrity checking against
file infectors can never be made 100% secure as long as
you are using a real-mode operating system like DOS.

It is quite possible to make a generic integrity checker that protects
against Brain, without the use of scan-strings. My own program does
this. The memory can be checked for integrity much like the harddisk
is checked, by looking in the right places.

Powering up your machine on March 6. with a Michelangelo infected
floppy, on a machine that permits floppy boots, can not be avoided
by any software based antivirus techniques. Not even a scanner able
to catch ALL known and unknown viruses would be of ANY help at
all in this scenario...

Subject: New(?) Virus MAKE MONEY FAST (Humor)

Hi,
    This virus has been seen increasingly often on internet.  I first
saw it on NOVELLR.  It has since been seen on misc.consumers, rec.audio
EMUSIC-L and alt.music.progressive.  It infects both LISTSERVEs and
newsgroups.
    Identification is easy, the virus contains the string 'David Rhodes'.
Symptoms proceed as follows:  An initial post is seen with a subject
matter of 'MAKE MONEY FAST'.  The nucleus of the virus contains an inane
scheme about chain lettering the internet.  There is an almost instant
response from the list/newsgroup members as they attack the virus with
antibodies (aka flames).  These antibodies contain such genetic
fragments as "pull this guys net access", "illegal" and "postmaster".
    As the effects widen, the list soon gets clogged with posts from
macrophages (aka netpolice) that are auto cc:ed to the unfortunate
postmaster of the originating site.  Further inFLAMEation can possibly
take place as the list moderator gets dragged in.
    The final phase of the infection is an aggravated plea from the list
moderator to ignore the virus.  It will then go into remission.
    The virus usually finds its way onto the the internet via someones

the "Divine Masters" virus which regularly infects rec.music.newage
and the "Hondas SUCK" virus that still hasn't been fully cleaned off
of rec.autos.
