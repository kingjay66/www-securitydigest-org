Subject: AI and Anti-viral studies

I have searched all the Virus-L archives, as well as the FAQ, and can find
no definitive answer on how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being used in
anti-virus studies.  Reference was made to a certain product, but the
manufacturer never made a reply.  Also, I saw at one time that Fridrik
Skulason made a remark that he was interested in AI, but I never saw a
follow up.  Is anybody really using AI techniques in their antivirus
software engineering?  It would seem that a rule-based system would be a
good one for engineering a good antivirus product, even though it may
be slow.  Another interesting avenue of investigation might be the
utilization of AI's game theory algorithms (e.g., minimax) in the ultimate
game of the good guys vs. the bad guys.  Or maybe somebody out there is
using neural networks to learn all the possible means of PC attack and
counter attack.  Study of Genetic Algorithms seems ideally suited for
application to antivirus studies.  If nobody is doing this, it seems
now would be a good time!

Subject: Australia's CVIG closes doors!

With end-1993, "Computer Virus Interest Group News"
(Brisbane/Australia) distributed it's last (Vo.3 No.11) edition. As a
Queensland government grant to Queensland Univ. of Technology expired
after 3 years, CVIG is dissolved by end-of-1993, and CVIG News will no
longer contribute in fighting virus incidents. CVIG's qualified
analyses of products and descriptions of malicious code (Virus/Worms..
Fact Sheets) and CVIG's trend analysis made significant contributions
about Down-Under and Far-East trends; CVIG's end will leave a vacuum
which will be hard to fill :-)

The final edition mentions the maturity of Australian AV-producers.
CYBEC, Leprachaun and few more Australian AV producers/distributors
offer to take over CVIG's task to collect data on viral events and
warn about imminent threats.  Scott Mewett, in his last contribution,
mentions that replies to recent CVIG questionaires seemed to indicate
a continuous decline in 1993 in viral events, down -13% in 2nd quarter
and even -27% (from 111 to 67 reported events) in 3rd quarter 1993.
But when CVIG analysed the trends in their home university (QUT), they
found a contrasting increase in viral incidents in both 2nd and 3rd
quar- ter! Unfortunately, CVIG will no longer be able to analyse the
evident contra- diction between these figures!

It is with some amusement that readers from outside "Down-Under" read
the last "Readers Forum", where Elizabeth Gunn from Leprachaun argues
that "Australian AV products are comparable, if not better than rival
overseas products". It remaims to wish that Aussie-AV experts succeed
to fill the gap which CVIG undoubtedly leaves behind.

Subject: Re: Cracked by the Cyborg

I need some NET Wisdom.....

Has any body heard of a virus with a name even similar to
something like:  "Cracked by the Cyborg" ???

Couldn't start up my home DOS machine.  Said there was a problem with the
C drive.  I repaired it with Norton, started it up and every thing seemed
fine.  But when I executed a game (Budo) I see the message appear for
an instant:  "Cracked by the Cyborg".  Since the game has nothing todo
with Cyborgs and I just had a problem starting the machine, I suspect
this to be a virus' msg.

Any ideas?

Previous sypmtoms of odd behavior:  Difficult to say, I have been
installing the Japanese DOS J5.0V system along with its' compatible
MS windows.  I was having keyboard mapping problems (nothing strange) &
once or twice the CPU locked up on me.  I attributed this to the OS, but
thought it a little unusual.

Go to your favourite anonymous ftp site and grab a copy of VSUM 9310.
(While it is not the most accurate source of information, there is nothing
better.)
Count how many viruses 'do nothing besides replicate.'
Count how many 'reformat the hard drive.'
There is a clear winner, and by a large margin.
There are more non-malicious viruses than they are malicious ones.

While this proves nothing about the inherent properties of a computer
virus, it illustrates another flaw in the thinking of most people.
Go to your favourite dictionary and look up the word 'inherent.'

Using your argument: ANY piece of software, in theory (and in real life)
has an environment in which it will be harmful!
And most software has not been written with the intent of causing damage!
This argument proves nothing, as it is just a theoretical generalization
of operating system / software interaction.

My point is to show that comparing viruses to feline predators is complete
nonsense.
Most viruses are unsuccessful in their action. Most feline predators are not.

EVERY program modifies the environment in some way,
(go and look up some book on the theory of operating systems.)
using YOUR logic: then every program causes damage to the system.
Again, 'To Modify' does not equal 'to cause damage', to assert so
is completely idiotic!
Every software company modifies their own product constantly, and yet
this modification can hardly be considered 'damage.'

None one of the examples you mention has anything to do with the
theoretical properties of computer viruses.
(they don't even have anything to do with computer viruses, mixing
computer criminals with this is innapropiate.)
Go Read any of Fred Cohen's papers and then come back to argue.

I am not looking for an argument to support the existence of viruses.
There are many valid arguments for this.
I am trying to show that viruses are not by definition inherently
destructive.
There are a lot of viruses that don't cause 'spurious behaviour' in people's
computers, so your point is not valid.

how so? can you show us how?
do you have ANY known example of a computer virus writer infecting
directly any system?

And without people like John Mcafee, Mr. Bontchev and Sarah Gordon many
virus writers would not exist.

Could you be more specific?

Dangerous?
Can you show that ALL viruses are dangerous?
Can you show that most viruses are dangerous? ( > 60% )
IF you cannot show some information relevant to the matter then you question
is off grounds since neither virus vector or virus writers are dangerous.
'What is more dangerous, a computer virus or a irresponsible Novell systems
administrator / systems programmer ?' :)

But virus writers are not any more criminal than any Novell systems

If it is an attack then it is more likley to be a trojan.  Peform the command
find / -name cp -print > report
then examine the report for "cp" commands that should not exist.  Also use the
file command on them to insure they are all executables and not a script.  You
can also use diff to compare them to copies of "cp" on a known good system.  If
you still think you have problems after this contact me and I will provide a

Well is sells the product, that might be a good reason for the claims, However
there is something true behind it... V-CARE (my product and also the one that

Whay should they answer? McAfee does not go the generic way [What? No updates?
:-( ], and Patricia has no interst in this, I wrote (Faxed) to McAfee 5 some
years ago on some Virus issue and was ignored completely. Besides: Why do you
think he'd know the answers?

If you are looking for reviews, read the french magazines,
I'm sure you'll find more reviwes then you can read (the product is called
ViGUARD in France).

BTW, V-CARE is not new, it exists some 5 years or so... and did the same then

True, it still is! CSA has the distribution rights, but the V-CARE product is
developed and produced by NSE Software of Israel (humbly yours). What you call
Invircible was once a part of V-CARE and now is a separete product. As so V-
CARE has all the features that are in the InVircible product, The InVircible
doesn't have what V-CARE has. For example it doesn't have a TSR prevention
module.

V-CARE started the Generic "thing", some of the features that were introduced
by V-CARE are also implemeted in other products like UnTouchable. And No:
InVircible *does* use scanning, but gives less weight to this module as the
main motive is Generality. As so: you cannot use InVircible on a previously
infected disk.

Yes. The avarage speed of file scanning by both V-CARE and InVircible is about
2500 files per minute. (No other product in the worls competes with that). V-
CARE has a veraity of generic methods that can be used to clean unknown
viruses (and obviously to detect unknown viruses).

Beware! InVircible attacks the CPAV immunization system as it considers it a "
virus" or an illegal type of modification. The problem you described could be
the result.

BTW, if you are looking for reviews, look in the French magazines, I'm sure
you'l find more reviews then you can read. (The product is called there "
ViGUARD").

Generally the InVircible is a  part of the Generic modules of
V-CARE, it requires to be previously installed in order to protect
your PC, and it will allways work *ONLY AFTER* the infection was done!
V-CARE however invests a seriouse interest in preventing and in detecting an
dealing with new viruses.

You've  asked...

For what it is worth, I ran into something similar with the file that
moves my DiskSecure (now v2.4 and FreeWare) intercept into low memory, if
QEMM 7.+ DOSDATA.SYS and DOS-UP.SYS are in use, my stuff would lock up.

After talking with QEMM and receiving a copy of their API, I wrote a program,
QEMMST.COM (included in the DS24.ZIP) that will determine if QEMM v6.0 or
above is in use and will return an errorlevel equal to the version number if
present.

Unfortunately, you cannot as yet inquire whether DOSDATA is in use however
if QEMM 7.x is present, it is likely.

It's a bug in InVircible.
When CPAV "immunize" a file, it appends a short CRC checking code  and
a 5 bytes "MSDOS" signature to it. The "MSDOS" sig is ment to fool some
virus (a variant of Jerusalem, as far as I remember). When the scaning
module of InVirceble detects a file "immunized" by CPAV, it removes that
"MSDOS" sig (without asking for user confirmation, without any user
notification and without even updating its own signatures database) and
hence the missing 5 bytes.

:     and is 5.01 the latest version ?

The last version I know of is 5.04A.

Subject: Vincent Virus in Malta (PC)

A number of PC's at the PC Lab of the Dept. of Information Systems
at the University of Malta were infected last December with a boot sector
virus called Vincent. It infects the MBR like No_INT does.
Scanners such as Dr. Solomon's Toolkit detect it incorrectly as No_INT
(CARO name Stoned.No_INT).
BOOT-ID reports the boot sector as #40L7QVS.T8P and displays
  "..unknown; seems to be a boot sector, possibly a
   virus ("MSDOS4.0")".

There are no strings embedded in the boot sector. Its operation is identical
to Stoned III or No_INT, and can be cleaned with any antivirus software which
can clean No_INT. It copies the original floppy boot sector to
track 0 head 1 sector 3 and the original HD MBR to track 0 head 0 sector
7, just like No_INT.

Two years ago, this same virus infected the PC lab. of the Computing Dept.
(as it was known then), and I had called it 'Vincent' after the first
student who had his working floppy infected by the virus during a Pascal
programming practical session.

After analysing it, I have extracted the following search pattern
which may be used for Vincent (I propose the CARO name Stoned.No_INT.Vincent):

83 FA 01 77 05 E8 0A 00 72 00 58 1F

It does no damage other than overwriting any directory entries which may be
present on floppies (just like No_INT).

Someone out there know something about the "Rael" virus?  It's
reported by TBAV 6.09, but not by F-Prot 2.10c or Scan 109...  I don't
know nothing about this virus (except his name :), and I think that
the virus is actually inside a packed program, because a friend that
got it deleted the infected programs, checked all, and aparently was
clean, but when checked again next day the virus was here...
Obviously, allways has been detected with TBAV... but perhaps the
virus are compressed within a program, and then here is not detected.

The virus is detected with newer versions of another antivirus (I ear
something about scan 110, f-prot 2.10f, and AVP 1.07b)? How i can get
rid of it? (if thereis inside a packed program, except for trial all
then programs in this machine)

Nice said.
However you'd be surprized to know that since
V-CARE invented the smart-signature stuff, almost NO change in the system was
necessary (more then 5 years now). And not only that but even the product that
you yourself like(ed?) most (Untouchable or Vanalyst) has learned the system
from us, and also didn't have to change much in the last 2 years.

That is exactly the difference between V-CARE and InVircible, While V-CARE is
strong both in specific scanning (VSCAN), specific preventing (VSECURE-TSR),
and even heuristic scanning, InVircible only does the integrity checking.

V-CARE protects your Disk very well against this type of viruses, as they are
the simplest to prevent, (please refer to previouse dicussions on VirNet some
8 monthes ago). However integrity checking is easily capable of detecting and
cleaning boot viruses, in-fact its easier then file infectors.

Is that your idea of a problematic virus? how about a virus that infects only
a PC with a modem and only when there is a call on the line? or one that
infects only PCs with Spanish keyboard support? or... ;-)  I mean: les't not
get too theoretical
on this, there are enough viruses in the world that pose a problem
then to go look for one that does not exist or that if it would
exist i'd bet you (I see you like betting) that it wount spread enough to
justify changing the whole Anti-Virus scheam.

BTW, as everyone knows that people tend to modify viruses, think of a simple
modification of Michelangelo that triggers on March the 7th (???) Don't change
your system date ahead or you might be surprized...8-)

Slight confusion here: while the virus is polymorphic, and
can't be detected by a simple scan string, it's entirely
possible to write a small algorithmic detector for it.
So the latest version of any decent scanner (including
IBM AntiVirus) should detect SatanBug just fine, without
having to use "generic" detection (without, for instance,
allowing it to spread and noticing the changes later).

In general, "generic" sorts of detection are needed only
to detect brand-new viruses that the developers haven't
seen yet.  Once the developers have a sample of the virus,
the best policy is to make sure that the product can
specifically detect *that* virus, by non-generic means.
At least if the virus is actually out in the world spreading...

I have an old i386-20 motherboard and 4 Conner hard drives (3 100MB

experienced very interesting problems.  Whenever any of the 100MB

any access to a hard drive (170 or 100).

Has anyone heard of a problem like this? (By the way, I can only use
two drives at any one time due to BIOS limitations.)

The first thing you need to do is download the Virus -L FAQ and read the
answers to many of your questions.  The fact that you have three of the
best Virus Scanners indicates that you have the tools to deal with the
Stoned virus [see FAQ C.9].

The Stoned virus family have historicaly been infectors of the Master Boot

virus software does not ID any infected files or programs would be normal
and not considered a "false positive" [see FAQ C.5].

To disinfect your system read FAQ C.3.

It is important for you to understand that you have to use a virus scanner/
cleaner from a CLEAN, write-protected floppy AFTER you boot up from a CLEAN
write-protected floppy bootdisk! [see FAQ C.6]

I attempted to respond to your inquiry via INTERNET email but had it
