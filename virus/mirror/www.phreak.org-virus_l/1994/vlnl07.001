All of the above, except Jerusalem, are boot or master boot sector
infectors. You are strongly advised to suggest your customer one of
the following (whichever is more appropriate to them):

1) Modify the CMOS settings, so that the BIOS tries to boot from the
hard disk first - on many of the contemporary machines this is
possible.

2) Install Padgett's DiskSecure II.

3) Use Henrik Stroem's HS.

The frequency of the cases of virus infections have indeed increased
lately, as well as the number of known viruses and the number of known
viruses in the wild. It's pretty predictable.

1) This doesn't contradict our claim that each CARO member has his own
collection and there is no such thing as "The CARO Virus Collection".
It simply doesn't exist.

2) Our "goat files" are certainly no secret, so anybody could get them,
infect them with viruses and distribute them.

3) It's pretty easy to create infected goat files that claim to belong
to one of us. I can easily create scores of them, and they can say
that they belong to me, to CARO, to you, to the President Clinton, and
so on.

OK. As several people mentioned here, it is OK to write a virus, if
you don't give it to anybody. However, if it appears somewhere where
it is not wanted, then you are partly responsible for it. Do you agree
with this?

OK, let's put it in another way. All viruses are harmful (i.e. can
cause damage) in some environments. Some of the existing viruses are
written with the intent to be harmful, while others cause harm
non-intentionally. Do you agree with this or should I eleaborate?

Not true. Simple replication cases modification and *this* can be
destructive (although I like the more general term "harmful"), even if
the virus doesn't have intentionally malicious code in it. In fact, we
call such viruses "not intentionally destructive" - that is, they
*may* destroy something, but not intentionally.

> most viruses to date does not prove the point that all viruses are malicious.

*All* currently existing viruses *can* be harmful in some
environments. More exactly, for every possible virus, there exists a
combination of software and hardware, on which it causes damage. As
far as I recall, this rule was first formulated (although not
necessarily in this exact wording) by Prof. Harold Highland.

Exactly! It depends on the environment! A virus which does "del *.*"
at 12:00 may be even beneficial in an environment when it is desired
that all files in the current directory are deleted at that time.

Yes. Unfortunately, all known (and possible, IMHO) viruses interfer
with the system. Of course, the same can be said for any other
program.

Again, it depends on the environment. If I have mostly self-checking
programs on my computer, I certainly wouldn't want some nastie to
compress them for me, because then they will not run. Also, I might
need the applications to start as fast as possible, so slowing the
startup down for decompression might be harmful for me.

Yes, it does. In that particular environment.

Yes, all programs are harmful in some environments. However, I don't
authorise them to run in environments in which they can be harmful.
This is another key word - authorisaton. If the virus comes on my
system *only* if I have authorised (installed) it myself, then I am
not considering it as harmful - after all, if I have decided to
install it, I probably have pretty good reasons for that.

> problems caused by buggy software destructive?  Perhaps not for my word

Yet another proof that it depends on the environment. The problem with
the currently existing viruses is that their spread cannot be
controlled, they are too buggy, and they don't wait to be installed on
a system by the owner of the system AND with his/her permission. In
fact, the authorization must be active - that is, I have to actively
install or invite the virus. Just asking me for permission to infect
is not good enough, because it interrupts me (without my
authorisation) and in some cases this can be harmful.

Subject: Integrity of files at ftp sites

I recently asked the group comp.sys.sgi.graphic for solutions to a
programming problem I was having.  Several people pointed me to a
public domain library available via anonymous ftp which gave me the
tools I was looking for.

The library is called FORMS v2.2, by Mark Overmars.  It is available
at ftp.cs.ruu.nl.

I ftp'ed this library, and looked it over. It seemed to be exactly
what I was looking for.

My manager, however, was concerned about using public domain tools and
libraries from "unknown" sources.  He was concerned about viruses and
security risks.

There is so much excellent public domain software available on
the internet.  How do I go about using whats available, while
ensuring my manager that security is not being threatened.

How can I verify the integrity of the software at ftp.cs.ruu.nl,
specifically; and other p.d. software in general?

I have no reason to doubt the integrity of the author of the
library, but my faith isn't enough to convince my manager.

Please excuse me if this is already covered in a FAQ.

Pardon me if I sound ignorant (for I haven't been following the
thread), but this point seems a bit hard to swallow.  Please clarify
how when there are so many viruses out there that reformat the hard
drive or one of my favorite (not because it destroys data, but because
it was cunning) is the one that randomly erases a sector for every 16
files it infects.  How can these be said to not be destructive??

I can confirm this. Frisk, it seems to be a bug. The files *can* be
opened for reading (e.g., with F3 of Norton Commander run in a DOS
window), so they are not locked and I see no reason why the scanner
should not be able to read them.

Ugh, no, you got it slightly backwards. It is Twitch that doesn't
touch the Windows executables - it simply renames them. It is a
Windows application itself, though. But I have been unable to make it
replicate too.

WinVir is aware of the NewEXE format and infects Windows executables
perfectly. It is non-resident and when you start the application it
disinfects it (but infects another one in the current directory).

Just for the record, by "1226" SCAN probably means the virus
Phoenix.1226, which is a file, not a boot sector infector. Although, I

Please, folks, read the FAQ for information how to ask such questions!
What machine? (I'll assume that it's an IBM PC and it was you, not the
moderator, who put "(PC)" in your Subject: line.) Which scanner
reported it? Which version? What other anti-virus software were you
running? Without all this information, it is pretty hopeless to figure
out how to help you.

There is a virus, called VFSI, which displays a message, saying

	HELLO!!! HAPPY DAY and SUCCESS

Maybe a scanner is reporting it under the name "Nice Day"?

Hello, everybody!

Version 1.56 (V109) of McAfee Associates' NETShield (an NLM) for
Novell NetWare 4.x does not detect the Tremor virus. Of 7,395 infected
files, it detected only 8 and reported them as "DAME [DAME]" - a name
that it usually give to MtE-based viruses.

As opposed to that, SCAN 109 seems to detect the virus reliably. Don't

Has anybody else noticed this 'bug' in ThunderByte's anti-viral boot
sector/partition feature? If you are using IBM DOS version 6 and QEMM
version 7.0 or higher with the DOS-UP feature enabled, ThunderByte's
partition software will be triggered when it 'check system ram'.  I find
this unfortunate since it prevents me from being able to actually use the
feature with out having to type in 'y' to continue each time.

And I have a question about TBAV's anti-vir.dat files. What is to prevent
someone from packing the anti-vir.dat file along with an infected file? If
they have force-validated it then it wont trigger thunder byte's virus
scan no matter how suspicious it looks. WOuldnt it be smarter to have a
user defined filename for the anti-vir.dat file? (or is this feature
already included and I missed it?)

hi,
	our LAN has recently got infected with a new(???) virus. it
has the following characteristics.

1.	Affects only com files.

2.	Attaches a 3K segment to the file.

3. 	Infected program on running hangs.

4.	The virus stores names of files it had infected somewhere on the
	hard disk. If one deletes an infected file,powers down the machine
	and tries to copy the file again from some other source the file
	copied again gets a 3K segment attached to it. Xcopy with the /v
	option hangs if used for copying the program.

5.	dir with an argument say
		dir c*
	does not show any files beginning with 'c', but plain dir shows the
	files. on rerunning command.com this problem disappears.

6.	On one PC after infecting the command.com it subsequently infected
	all com files.

	I tried scan, tntvirus, vshield and cpav to detect the virus but i
couldn't detect it. Has anyone heard of this virus and what is the cure ?

thanks and cheers,

you have found what is (in our company) known as the MORE virus. The
files you are referring to are 0 bytes?
They are some temporary files as created by the MORE command.
Better check out all the system because I think all machines in the
world are infected by this :-)

jcchan@solomon.technet.sg (Chan Joo Chong) asked this same question
back in October; you might want to contact that person to see
if your problems are related.  Back then, I answered as follows:

We've seen a virus that we call YMP-NiceDay; it may be the same
thing that you have.  It's a diskette and hard disk master boot
infector, and on the first of the month it will display
"HAVE A NICE DAY (c) YMP" during boot.  To clean up an infected
hard disk:

   - Power off and boot from a clean DOS diskette.

   - Make sure the hard disk partitions are visible
     (Important!  Don't skip this step!).

   - Use "FDISK /MBR" to replace the code in the master
     boot record.  (This requires the FDISK command from
     DOS 5 or better.)

We've seen this virus only in Indonesia so far, but that's not
*too* far from you.   Of course, the virus that you have may
be completely unrelated to the one I describe here!

I'll have to disagree with Kevin Marcus, or perhaps I just
misunderstood his posting: Winvir does infect Windows executables,
but it does it without using any Windows functions (it just
uses DOS calls to plunk itself into a Windows program in such
a way that it gets executed when you click on it).  Twitch, on
the other hand, uses lots of Windows functions, but doesn't
actually infect files; it's more a companion-type virus (after
some amount of time, it begins replacing other windows programs
with a copy of itself, and saving the originals under another
name, or something like that).  Neither virus has, to my
knowledge, been seen "in the wild", and neither uses an
infection strategy that I would expect to be very successful...

Subject: Re: New type of virus, EXE-header infector (PC)

        today I have faced with one new and unique virus, which
was  found  in  Moscow  State  University (Russia). After short
investigation   I   understood   that  virus   is  new:  F-PROT
Professional 2.10,  SCAN-108 and AIDSTEST 746 - cannot identify
it.
        Technology  of  virus seemes to be uncommon. It infects
EXE headers.  Only headers! Virus does not change EXE file code
in any way and it does  not use any DOS functions (only one and
only  once -  to set itself resident, Int 27h).  Infected files
are not changed in size.
        Virus  contains  only  one string (at viral code end) -
'(C)VVM'. I called virus "VVM".
        Virus  appeared  to be extremely short - 205 bytes, but
it is resident, stealth virus, infecting each accesses EXE file!
        I  think  that  VVM  should  be regarded as new type of
virus (additionally to: file, boot, cluster, companion) because:
        - virus do not use  any DOS services to infect files,
          it intercepts  low-level disk writes  (like DIR-II)
        - VVM "infects" any  disk sector  starting with "MZ",
          because it regards it as EXE header!
        - infection strategy is specific for MS-DOS EXE files
          structure,  this strategy cannot be used  to infect
          real COM files (without EXE header)
        - VVM uses DOS quirk that EXE/COM files are processed
          similarly  (feature,  already  used  by   companion
          viruses)

        In  order  to  find virus you have to reboot from clean
floppy, because  virus is stealth.  Any integrity  checker will
found VVM, because each  EXE header will be seen as modified in
only one (!) byte  (third byte of EXE header is not restored by
virus stealth routine).
        With  very  high probability any EXE starting with  the
following three  bytes - E9, 30, 01 is infected with VVM virus.
To disinfect (quickly) you only need to restore first two bytes
to original EXE header signature 'MZ'.
        Unique   signature   to   find   virus  more  reliably:
"B4,13,BA,75,02,8B,DA,CD".
        VVM virus conflicts with SMARTDRV (and, probably, other
disk-caching   utilities) -   infected   programs   hangs  with
diagnostics "Memory allocation error/Cannot load COMMAND". Some
users  reported  that  many  lost  clusters  were found on some
infected computers.

        Best regards, Igor.

Subject: Possible Network Infection (PC)

Posting this on behalf of classmates who do not have Internet access.
Several people have reported the same problem with files on floppy disks.
The students are working with dBase IV v2.0 on a Novell Network.
The problem is simple enough: characters go missing from filenames, of
course this means that dBase gets rather confused and cannot access the files.

ie: CATALOG.CAT  becomes CATALOG.AT or something similar.
(I would have checked the files outmyself but they renamed them when they
saw the problem.)

simple answers wanted: is there a known virus which does this? If so, what
program will detect this particular virus? (I trust the schools virus
protection methods about as far as I can throw the PC's... which isn't far
because of the security cables...)

The school has had MANY problems with viruses in the past, in several
cases the files were infected on the network itself.
(generally the computers are rebooted between classes)

If instead this is a bug in dBase, or dos or Novell I would also like to
know of any possible solutions.

Subject: What is FScan? (PC)

An earlier discussion of zipped files suggested that F-Prot
doesn't scan them before they're opened.

A follow-up suggested that the poster user FScan. (I think
I have this right?)

Okay, I'm willing, but what is it? A program (I can't find
it in the oak virus directory)? A switch for F-Prot (I can't
find it in the manual)?

Thanks - Dan Ford
