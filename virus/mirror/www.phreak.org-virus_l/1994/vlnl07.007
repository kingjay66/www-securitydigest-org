The primary use of AI is in ad copy: "...a sophisticated rule-based
system...".  Of course, all of the rules are of the form "if
the file contains the binary string xxxxx, report virus vvvvv"!  *8)

While various AI-related fields are very interesting, and some
have at least superficial links to viruses and virus prevention,
IMHO very few techniques that really deserve the "AI" label
are developed enough to have practical impact on the field.
Heuristic detectors are of course rule-based in some sense (as
is every computer program), but they are seldom or never
implemented in the separate-rules-from-rule-engine style that
marks (attempts at) AI; this is because, as you point out,
that style is slow.  Genetic algorithms sound like they should
have something to do with viruses, but in fact the link is
tenuous and occasional: in real life, viruses mutate very
seldom, and almost never in interesting ways.  Aside from the
obvious observation that some modifications are better than
others, I don't see a lot of relevance, certainly not to
Holland-syle GA.  We've done studies based on epidemiological
models of disease spread; these models may also be relevant
to artifical-life studies, but the relationship is at one
remove.  And so on.

Some techniques from the field of AI (various search methods,
heuristic techniques in general, and so on) are useful as parts
of an anti-virus research strategy, but none (IMHO) has a really
strong practical connection, despite initial impressions.

If you can think of some concrete way that some AI technique
(or any other technique!) might be useful in (anti-)virus
research, do post it here!  (And, of course, be prepared to
ignore a number of knee-jerk negative comments; this is
the Net after all, hehe.)

Subject: "Good Viruses?" and other stuff

First, let me answer a few questions quickly:  PC Cyborg is a hacker who
has broken the copy protection of many programs.  Seeing this message on
any game you have run does not necessarily imply a virus, but it does
likely imply that you are bootlegging software and depriving someone of
the income it takes to keep them in business writing game software.  If you
use it, pay for it.  Also, invest in a scanner!

Second, the FORM virus infects the DOS boot sector of hard drives and the
boot sector of diskettes.  This virus is quickly becomming one of the more
popular viruses replacing Stoned as one of the most widely reported viruses.
To cure, reboot from a write-protected floppy that has the same version of the
operating system as the one on your infected hard drive, then run SYS C:.  This
will replace the infected boot sector where the FORM virus has infected and
will kill the virus.

Now, into the fire...

Ktark writes that he is unconvinced that all viruses are inherently bad.  Well,
try reading my other posting!  Okay, I concede that viruses in a lab that is
isolated from the world were I am conducting research into viruses and
artificial life may not be bad because I want them there.  But, I think we are
talking about viruses in the wild.  Viruses in the wild are inherently bad.
(I checked the dictionary meaning of 'inherent' :-)) To state otherwise would
be to deny reality.  As we have stated before, anything that can be done with
a virus, can be done with a non-virus program (or I should say, anything
useful).  In my opinion, Cohen is essentially stating a research hypothesis
when he talks about useful viruses.  Research into this is not inherently
bad, but Cohen, I'm sure, is conducting this research in a lab environment.
Research for research sake can lead to new knowledge, but as we all know,
is unlikely to produce a commercially viable product! :-)  Let's put it this
way, I challenge anyone to put forth (even conceptually) a virus that would
be considered "good" in that it would be beneficial for it to be released in
the wild.  The compression virus that Cohen postulates, is not something that
we desire, compression is being done perfectly well by other methods.  Cohen is
just putting this out to stimulate thought.  I can't believe that he actually
thinks for one minute that he will actually be producing and releasing into
the wild, good viruses.  There is no such thing.  If there was, then we would
be ready to just allow them to infect our systems right?  Ktark, there is one
saying that I think fits here "Wake up and smell the coffee!"  To postulate
that there is a good virus is to postulate that you know better than anyone
else what is good for their systems.  Would you advocate releasing "good"
viruses into the world?  Have you ever heard of version control?  Configuration
management?  System integrity?  I would not discourage you from looking for
the "holy grail" of useful viruses in a lab environment, but don't flaunt
your ignorance by stating that there is such a thing as a good virus in the
wild.  If you want to get into a philosophical discussion and get into proofs
by contradiction etc. that is useful for the parties and 2:00 a.m. conversation
but has no application to reality.  Perhaps you ought to ask Cohen if he would
really be willing to release one of his "good" viruses into the wild?  Even as
a commercial product?  I would imagine that he would admit that research in the
lab will likely be as far as he will ever go.  You remember that people did
once think the world was flat, that's because their view was limited.  I think
the view that there are good viruses only applies to labwork.  No such thing
exists in the wild.  Period.

Subject: AI techniques for anti-viruses

Jim Hendee asked a question about AI techniques and anti-viruses,
it is likely the case that all anti-viruses (or most anyway) use some
AI techniques in order to detect viruses.  Many uses heuristics, and in fact,
this is the only way to detect polymorphic viruses.  So, to an extent, AI is
already in use.  As far as using neural networks for virus detection, I have
done some research in this area.  So as not to bore you with the details, I
will simply state the problems I discovered that have to be overcome if this
technique is ever to bear any fruit:

1) Static code disassemblies are often useless in ascertaining the true
function of a virus.  Many viruses have encrypted code or self-modifying
code that does not show itself in other than a dynamic/trace disassembly.
To perform this will take some time, and a virtual machine that will not
be subject to virus armouring against disassembly.

2) Is there anything inherently different between virus code and normal code?
If the answer is no, then neural networks will not be able to distinguish
between the two.

3) How do you get a neural network to distinguish between code and data?

4) What n-tuples will you feed into the neural network?  If you are off by even
a single instruction, your whole interpretation of the code can be different.

5) If you can create a neural network (most likely back-propogation), can you
even get convergence for viral and non-viral code samples?

6) This techinique likely involves the following:  choose a random sample out
of the virus population (stratified random sample would be best to ensure that
the code in the sample was representative of the population).  Also, do the
same for non-virus programs.  Use them to train a neural network (assuming
you can get convergence).  Then use the neural network to test the rest of
your viruses and non-viruses.  Does it catch them?  What are the type 1 and
type 2 error rates?  Are they acceptable (some would say that only 100%
detection and 0% false positives would be acceptable)?  I would say that
if you could come close, this would be interesting, but no one is likely to
take notice unless you can do at least as well as conventional techniques.

I am not trying to discourage research in this area.  I only wanted to state
some of the problems that have to be surmounted before it can be even
moderately feasible to use neural networks for the detection of viruses.
I think that someone may eventually be able to come up with solutions to
the problems I have raised.  It was beyond my nominal understanding of neural
networks to do this and perhaps that was the major limiting factor. :-)

Subject: "Good Viruses?"

From:    ktark@src4src.linet.org

>Let us add some more world perspective to this:
>You have an economical and personal interest in making all computer viruses
>appear as evil incarnate, you make a living out of this premise, whether

>Let us hear from someone who has no stakes in this matter..

(deleted my original opening lines, were too emotional)

I have a personal interest in making viruses obsolete so that I do not have
to deal with them any longer. I do not have an "economical" interest
(did once - spent *lots* more money than I made - now all of my software is
FreeWare).

Ever wonder why AI and Expert Systems are not found in aircraft flight
controls ? Because it *must* be exactly the same in the field as it is
in the lab. PCs crash a lot. We accept that. The crash that would result
from a loss of the digital flight control system in an F-16 is liable
to make a lot more noise.

The simple fact is that we have trouble predicting how a stable system w
ill operate under every possible condition without adding the instability
a virus would cause.

The example of a computer that has no contact with the outside reminds
me of the SPACKLE cure - effective but the computer is useless. This
is the effect of the pro-virus arguments I've seen so far - at best a
virus has no social value and it goes negative from there.

Further, *every* use I have seen postulated for a virus does not require
a virus to accomplish.

Certainly, I have seen some innovative programming techniques used in
viruses *but never in what made the virus a virus* - that part is trivial,
well documented, and boooooooring. Invariably, it is the evasion and
"stealth" that I find interesting. The fact is that most of the virus
code I've seen lately has been remarkably bad and carelessly written.

Take the SBug - it can't even add right (and that's something that
computers are really good at) when it goes resident. True, it has a
complex mutating mechanism but that just makes repair difficult,
not detection. Kind of like cutting the end of a bullet to ensure maiming
and not just a recoverable wound. Wanton destruction. Vandalism. Zip guns
and pipe bombs.

Personally, virus writers remind me of a litter of puppies, investigating
everything without really understanding it. Eventually they grow up if
they stay out of real danger but meanwhile someone else has to clean up
their messes.

Subject: What is a virus ?

I recenly came across this in a document that describes viruses that
run on the Acorn Archimdes computer. It is part of the description of
a not-uncommon virus. Is there anyone out there who thinks that this
is a valid reason for not calling it a virus? And if so, what is it?

     This is not a virus as such, due to the fact no actual harm is down to
     your discs. It is merely a desktop 'silly' hat is capable of replicating
     amongst any application NOT already having a !Boot file.

This is not totally true; How would DIR-II be handled in this case?  What
about other memory resident stealth viruses?  There must be some form of
memory identification.  If not, as a more secure system, there could be a
boot from a floppy forced before the execution of the program will run.  But,
even then, who's to say a disk isn't infectde already?

There are no known viruses that run on the Netware operating system
itself (that's the operating system that the server itself runs).
The known viruses work under the OS's that the server's clients are
using; if there's some combination of client operations that can
destroy a volume or abend the server, a client virus could
conceivably do that.  But I don't know of any virus currently
active "in the wild" that intentionally does any damage to a
Netware server that it finds itself running on a client of.

There are various anti-virus NLMs out there; see for instance
a review in PC Week, December 27, 1993 (scattered about on pages
71-82 or so).  IBM AntiVirus includes an NLM starting with
version 1.04.  (It's one of the ones included in that review.)

Exactly 1300 ?  There are six different variants of the Barrotes virus known,
one 1303 byte long, and five 1310 byte ones.  If it is exactly 1300 bytes long,
it must be a new variant, and you should send a sample to one or more of the

Right...I got a copy of this virus just a short time ago.  I haven't analysed
it in detail, just a minimal analysis to allow F-PROT to detect/disinfect it.

It is 3211 bytes, appends itself to .COM files and overwrites the first 3 bytes
with a jump to the virus code.

I think I added detection/disinfection of it in 2.10f, but internally we
are up to 2.10h - all those minor versions are not released officially, as
that would mean a new version every week, and (I guess) significant confusion.

The latest OFFICIAL version is 2.10c, but we can send a copy of a later version
to anybody who has a problem with this virus (or any of the other 200 or so
new viruses we have added since 2.10c).

As I understand it, the Form virus infects command.com and the boot s

The only way to fix it is to boot from a write protected "clean" floppy and

It's a dangerous memory resident parasitic polymorphic virus. It
hooks INT 21h and writes itself at the end of COM-files (excluding
COMMAND.COM) are executed or opened. It hits the files on searching also
(DOS functions FindFirst/Next ASCII), this virus contains the text strings

 c:\dos\sys.com
 c:\dos\dosshell.com
 c:\dos\format.com
 c:\dos\keyb.com

and hits these files on execution of infected file. In depending of system

sectors on execution.

On 14th of every month it deletes the files after infection, and
starting from 12:00 it displays the message:

Subject: Reviews/opinions of Norman's ARMOUR? (PC)

Norman Data Defense's ARMOUR was recently recommended to me as a "good
antiviral package".  I'd be interested in objective comments and informed
opinions, pro or con, regarding ARMOUR, and any pointers to published
reviews of the package.  How does ARMOUR stack up against, say, F-PROT or
the McAfee suite for variety of virii recognized and removed, scanning
speed, frequency of update releases, ease of use by non-expert users,
general reliability of disinfection routines, lack of false positives, etc.?

Please reply by email; I'll summarize responses in a few weeks.

No, actually Ripper is purely a boot-sector infector; it
doesn't infect any files at all (see Roger Riordan's very
nice description in VIRUS-L 7/5).  If the Ripper is active
in memory and you use a non-write-protected diskette in
basically any way (including formatting it), the virus will
infect the diskette.  It's not that format.com is infected,
it's that the virus is active in memory and infecting any
diskette that format.com (or anything else!) is pointed at.

The "Loader cannot find..." error message is an error message from
NETShield saying that it is trying to use a function from your Novell
C Runtime Library (CLIB.NLM) that is not available in the version of
CLIB.NLM running on your server.

This can be fixed by installing Revision D of CLIB.NLM for Novell
NetWare v3.11, which is dated December, 1992.  You can download a
copy from NetWire (Novell's forums on CompuServe) or your local
Novell dealer should have the file.  It is also available from the
mcafee.com anonymous ftp site in the pub/antivirus directory as
311LIB.EXE (it is a self-extracting file).

Are you using any other antivirus programs at the same time as CPAV?
More likely than not, this is justa  false positive.  CPAV is pretty well
known for not being compatible with other AV products, and this sounds
a lot like a false id to me.  Try to boot from that same disk, but don't
execute a config.sys or autoexec.bat with anything more than a files=20 and
maybe a prompt $p$g, respectively...

Rescan the system with CPAV and see if it goes away.

A message like the one you keyed in can often be found in memory around
f000:0000, from your bios.  It's quite odd that would be printed out,
and I don't know of any virus that would print that.  You should try to
boot from a known noninfected write protected floppy and then scan your
drive.  Also, you might want to make sure your CMOS parameters for your
drive are correct (if you have an AT).  If you left the computer on for a
few moments with the hard drive light on, did anything happen?  Maybe
a message like, "hard disk controller failure" or something similar?

To me, it sounds like a non-virus related problem, maybe even hardware
(It's probably an old system judging by the copyright date)

Subject: re: Help in removing Monkey virus from hard disk (PC)

Dear All,

Maybe I have missed the thread somewhere here, but in case I have not,
here are some step-by-step instructions for removing viruses like
Monkey. Forgive any technical screw-ups, but I'm working from home,
(unsupported by a safety net here folks!).

Problem: If I boot from the hard drive, the hard disk appears to be okay,
but I have a MBS virus in memory. If I boot from the floppy disk, DOS cannot
see the hard drive. If I use FDISK /MBR, I screw up my disk.

Answer:

Let's consider what the virus is doing here. The virus replaces the entire
contents of the MBS with virus code, moving the original MBS elsewhere on the
disk. This means that if I boot from a floppy disk, the partition information
which DOS needs to 'see' drive C: is not there. This means that DOS cannot
find a DOS partition, and therefore wont read the hard drive.

FDISK /MBR won't work in such circumstances, because it works by replacing
the executable code in the MBS, without changing any of the partition
information. Thus, the virus is removed, but the partition information is
screwed up. No virus, but no hard disk either. Sigh.

However, when the virus is active, DOS can access the hard drive. Why?
Because the virus uses stealth techniques to swap in the original contents of
the MBS, giving DOS access to the partition information which it needs.

This gives us the clue of how to disinfect the disk. I should point out that
this is a last resort.

1. Make certain that the virus is not about to trigger - not too difficult
if you know what virus you have.

2. Boot from the hard drive. From this point onwards, the virus will be
memory resident.

3. Use any disk utility (eg Norton - is there any other? :-) to read in the
contents of the 1st physical sector on the disk. This should end with a 55AA
if it is the original DOS MBS. Save this sector as a file onto a floppy disk.
Please note that this floppy disk will become infected in the process.

4. Turn off the PC.

5. Boot from a clean, write-protected disk.

6. The DOS partition of the hard drive will now no longer be visible *but* the
hard drive can still be got at on a sector by sector basis. Use your
favourite disk editor to copy the contents of the file created in step 3 into
the first sector of the drive.

7. Hold your breath. Reboot the machine from the hard drive. The virus should
now be gone. (cue Tada.wav)... and the hard drive will be accessible.

For all MBS viruses encountered which cannot be disinfected with FDISK /MBR,
this technique should work HOWEVER if you lose all your data doing this I
don't want to be responsible. If you need more help on Boot Sector virus
disinfection, Email me, or better yet, post your question.

Hope this helps,

 F-PROT is very cheap (=<$1 for machine and free for individual use in your

"VIRSTOP error" means that Virstop for some strange reason cannot locate
itself.  This only happens if you use the /DISK switch....when another
program is run, Virstop tries to read the search strings from itself into
memory, but fails.  This might happen if the drive letter assignments
are changed after Virstop is loaded, but apart from that suggestion I really

Sorry...This is one of the few viruses that f-prot is not able to disinfect,
although it detects it without problems. As it is "in the wild", I'll give it

The virus writers know all about this...the details have been published in
their magazines a long time ago.   Basically this involves an INT call,
which tells the TSR to quietly disable itself, or even to remove itself
from memory.

Note that this has of course no effect on the scanner part.
