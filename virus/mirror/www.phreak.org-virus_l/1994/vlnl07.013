Subject: Help with Possible "911" Virus

I am requesting help with a possible "virus problem".  A California
Police  Department  is being hit with calls to their 911 [Emergency
Telephone System] that are generated by a  legitimate computer user
[who happens to be a Fidonet node]. The local telephone company has
verified that the telephone lines are okay.

Does anyone know of a virus that directs communications software to
dial 911?  If this is a real virus problem as opposed to some soft-
ware hardware  glitch it represents a  serious threat  to emergency
communications in this country.

Time  is  essential in  resolving  this problem.   Please Email any
responses to allentaylor@delphi.com ASAP.  Thanks.

	Hmmm...(a little devil's advocating here)...by that
definition, wouldn't the CONFIG.SYS line:

DEVICE=C:\DOS\SMARTDRV.EXE

be considered viral (as it's put in place by DOS 6.0's Install)?  What
of the creation of SMARTDRV.EXE, HIMEM.SYS, and EMM386.EXE in the root
of the boot device when one installs Windows, and the subsequent
changes to CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT (which are generally
unnecessary)?

	I would amend your definition slightly, to read "code designed
to spread ITSELF from system to system without the knowledge or
consent of the system owner".  I think this would help differentiate
between those things that are considered virii and those that are just
needlessly intrusive software.

Subject: Next version of DOS and viruses (PC)

I've heard that in addition to win-dose 4.0, a DOS 7.0 is supposed to be
released in the future, with no more .COM support.  Personally, I don't
know how they would implement that since there is always, "COMMAND.COM",
though they may just have some kind of internal 'redirection' to a COMMAND.EXE.
Nonetheless, were that to happen, does anyone have any thoughts on what
that would do to both the virus and antivirus world?  There are quite
a few viruses which only infect .COM files, and this could be siezed as
an opportunity to speed up scanners, make them smaller, etc, even though
the viruses could still spread on other systems.  (Like StarShip.  This
virus has basically no chance of spreading, yet a lot of products
detect it.  A long time ago, I thought it was very important to detect
everything that could be in the wild at some time, but now I am wondering
about the feasibility.)

Comments?

Well, there is no other non-trivial way of infecting your hard drive without
an attempted boot from the floppy.  However, a lot of people probably don't
know much about that, and might very well infect themselves.  I would
highly suggest that you inform the company and tell them where you
received the disks.  Also, in the future, it's probably not the best
idea to mention company names like that since, unless you know what you
are doing (I'm not saying you don't, but for others), you might be
panicing a lot of people over a false alarm and make a company look
bad.

Most newer BIOS's allow you to skip a floppy boot through the CMOS.
You still should probably get rid of the virus, just so that there are
no potential problems.

In all fairless, it must be noted that my access to those viruses is probably
somewhat better than McAfee's..... :-)

The question which product detects more viruses depends entirely on which
virus collection you use.  If I use my own virus collection, F-PROT naturally
detects more viruses than SCAN.  I assume that if the McAfee collection was
used instead, the reverse would be true.

If a third-party collection is used, the results vary - sometimes SCAN gets
slightly more viruses - sometimes F-PROT.  It all depends on which viruses
are included.

Nobody has a complete collection of all the 4000 (or so) existing PC viruses,
so a totally unbiased complete comparison is unfortunately impossible.

As a final note, in the latest VSUM (where SCAN has usually been slightly
higher than F-PROT), the results were as follows.

    F-PROT 2.10g 97.0%
    SCAN V111    94.6%

and then all the way down to

    MSAV         47.6%

>I have read and heard about how fast some antiviral scanners are.

Keep in mind that there are two totally separate issues here:

   1) Speed on a clean machine.

   2) Speed on an infected machine.

Most machines will not be infected most of the time, right ?  For this reason
certain scanners (in particular DSAVTK) try to maximize speed on clean
machines.

There are several ways to increase speed, including:

   1) scanning only selected parts of the files

   2) bypassing the DOS file system, and accessing the disk directly.

   3) code tracing - scanning only the part of the file that is executed
      initially.

>My question is with all of this so called speed is it possible to be
>missing some infections? Are some scanners not scanning the entire
>file to increase speed?

Most scanners don't scan the entire file, as that would be way to slow - in
fact I thought (I may be wrong here) that the only scanner that scans the
entire file by default was IBM's, although some other scanners offer that
as an option.

After all, with a few exceptions (Commander Bomber for example), a virus
cannot be located just anywhere in the file - it is usually either at the
beginning or at the end - so scanning the entire file for all viruses simply
does not make much sense.

This does not mean that it is sufficient to scan just the first X and the
last Y KB of any file - what if some garbage had been appended to the file,
for example...

Scanning only selected parts of the file should not lead to any missed
infections, provided the entire file is scanned for those few viruses that
can be located anywhere..

Well, Form is relatively harmless, compared to many other viruses, but still...

Anyhow - you don't have to boot from an infected diskette to become infected.
If you just forget an infected non-bootable disk in the machine, reboot,
get the "Non-bootable disk" message, remove the disk and continue, your
machine will become infected.

   We have significantly reduced the number of VIRSIM-generated files
   that F-PROT reports as containing a virus.  As the files are not
   really virus-infected, but only contain random fragments of viruses,
   any detection of them should be considered a false alarm.

There are still a few VIRSIM-generated samples that are reported as viruses,
but we are working on fixing that.

Well, F-PROT 2.11 detects Beethoven, but unfortunately it cannot remove it.
I was not aware that it was in the wild, but I'll give disinfection a
higher priority....2.11a should be able to remove it as well.

It has no other name...this is a relatively new virus, that is probably not
detected by the majority of current virus scanners.

Subject: McAfee VSHIELD v108 Problem with CANSU (PC)

	I have encountered a problem with McAfee's VSHIELD v108, aside
from the difficulty in deciphering the less than clear installation
instructions scattered throughout the VSHIELD document.  This problem
was encountered on a COMPAQ , DESKPRO, 386/20E, 16M Memory, C: and D:
hard drives plus A: 3.5: and B: 5.25: floppy drives running DOS6.2 and
WINDOWS 3.1 plus nothing else of interest.

	I use two 3.5: test diskettes one infected with FORM the other
with CANSU to test whether AV software is working.  A modest test but
this is the limit of my collection.  VSHWIN.EXE was installed from the
A: drive into C:\WINDOWS and statement run=vshwin.exe placed in
WIN.INI by manually running VSHIELD with /WINDOWS option.  VSHIELD
runs from the autoexec.bat with the options:
	VSHIELD /ACCESS /NOBREAK /NOREMOVE /M /ONLY A: B:
	Slightly paranoid maybe, but an attempt to prevent a virus
disabling VSHIELD - I hope? :-) I am also curious why VSHIELD and SCAN
default to scanning memory for STEALTH viruses only - does anyone know
why?

	While running in DOS, VSHIELD is capable of identifying both
Cansu and Form accurately.  Within WINDOWS using FILE MANAGER to do a
directory of the A: drive VSHIELD/VSHWIN accurately display a message
warning of the FORM infection but the PC hangs on the CANSU diskette.
When accessing the CANSU diskette the diskette drive light goes green,
quickly turns red then goes off.  If I try to soft boot, WINDOWS goes
into a long dialogue warning screen which states:
				WARNING
	The system is either busy or has become unstable.  You can
wait and see if the system bcomes available again and continue working
or you can restart your computer.  It then gives the option to press
any key to continue or else CTRL+ALT+DEL.  I was forced to take the
latter.

	The positive side is that the machine stopped :-).  The
negative side is that it did not tell me the diskette was infected
:-(.  The moral appears to be if your PC hangs while accessing a
diskette when running VSHEILD run Scan against that diskette.

	As an aside why is the floppy drive light sometimes green and
at others red?

A scanner that knows only several hundreds of viruses is surely NOT
enough today when we are dealing with almost 4000 viruses.
Furthermore InVirCible does NOT protect the PC from being infected
even by those 10 viruses that are most common in the world and the
public enemy #1. It will only recover (hopefully) the damaged files
AFTER infection, and this is not always possible.

    December 91, one month after the conference.

    Patricia's VSUM? I have piously avoided the certification of VSUM, and
    here is why: Pat certifies products by rating the percentage of viruses
    detected, when 'tested' against her collection. VSCAN, InVircible's
    scanner PURPOSELY recognizes only a few hundreds of viruses (the rest is
    taken care of by the generic modules - and there are at least three of
    them, not one). These 'few' hundreds, VSCAN removes them with
    micro-surgery precision, and unparalleled low 'false positives' or
    butchery due to misidentification. Practically, VSCAN identifies LESS
    viruses than any other product, but removes MORE than anybody else!
    Needless to explain what would have been InVircible's rating in VSUM.

    Now let's look on VSUM's reliability. First, it tells you nothing about
    what percent of the viruses that a product detects it can also safely
    and successfully remove. For example: McAfee's SCAN misidentifies Timor
    (a Jerusalem variant) as 1241, Emmie variants as Teletype, a Violator
    variant as Parasite, a Haifa variant as Trident etc. When cleaned by
    CLEAN you'll get a lot of ruined files. Next! VSUM indicates that
    Frodo-4096 (one of the 10 most common file infectors) can be detected by
    CPAV and MSAV. True? Wrong! All Carmel's derived scanners, CPAV/MSAV
    included DO NOT DETECT FRODO ANYMORE since the beginning of 1993. Former
    versions did. Conclusion: Patricia does probably more paper-work than
    actual testing. And this is just a short list.

    Take care and beware of anti-viruses. Viruses are less harmful!

What about "some" specific solutions, like maybe a TSR that detects the
infected floppy at first, and what about programs that work at the BIOS level
and recover your disk's MBR immediatelly etc'.

Wait, wait, what do you mean memory stealing? Oh you probably mean the 1 or 2
Ks missing from the memory. Well this is NOT always due to a virus, and in
some cases it might set an alarm on totaly legit programs.

In your case you talk about something you detect AFTER (or during) boot. No
one said that TSRs should replace this procedure. A good TSR can simple add a
protective feature pre-infection.

I couldnt sgree more, except that a carfully designed generic AV is not enough
to solve the user's problem. A complementary specific solution MUST be
inclouded and it MUST have some preventive features as well. Would you make
free sex with an infected AIDS mate assuming that there probably a generic
medicine for all viruses?

Some of the "hamfull" viruses as you call them are only harmfull on random
occasions. Do you not consider Michelangelo harmfull? Next day, or next week
is usually a day (or week) too late!

"We" don't scare people, they do well themselves. "We" try
to help people, and assume they should get all the help they can get and use
an AV that is the simplest to use and solves the maximal problems
transparently.

Sorry, that is not true. File servers need a lot of extra
protection especially if you are dealing with Lantastic, LANmanager, or even
Novell. There are holes everywhere in any system that runs or emulates DOS.

    InVircible is a carefully balanced combination of generic and
    conventional techniques, scanning included. It is true that InVircible's
    main thrust is generic, but it has also an extremely efficient scanner,
    VSCAN, dedicated to 'only' a few hundreds of common or problematic
    viruses. The combined power of both approaches spares the need for
    frequent scanner updates.

 CKN> Well, I can only point out an oddity I discovered after
 CKN> install.exe has finished the installation.
 CKN> The size of files inoculated by CPAV were decreased by 5 bytes. Is
 CKN> this normal ?

    The 5 'missing bytes' contained the string 'MsDos' added by an
    inoculation introduced five years ago by Carmel, now the origin of CPAV
    and MSAV. Unfortunately, this scheme caused more harm than good.
    Programs using self integrity checking got stuck, and from our point of
    view as AV producers, it masked sometimes the presence of a virus that
    was in the file, prior to its 'inoculation'. Therefore we 'peel' it off
    first thing.
    You mentioned Untouchable being used for the detection of the missing
    bytes. Have you tried UT after adding or deleting an entry from DOS 5+
    Setver.exe? This is certainly a benign change to the program. InVircible
    will refuse to "restore" the file while UT will treat it as if infected.

 > Is InVircible version 5.01 the latest?

    No, 5.01 is one year old. The current version is 5.04. It has important
    changes; we improved the diagnostic capability between benign/viral/
    updates changes and made the whole thing more friendly and automatic. We
    added new techniques in all programs, among them the unique boot
    anti-stealth feature. Ask SSL for a demo of the Nika/Quox/Newbug/Noint/
    Tequila/Flip viruses!

    The equivalent of the scanner update in first generation AV products is
    the addition of new techniques in ours. The purpose is to close
    loopholes when a new viral technology emerges. Fortunately, less general
    counter techniques are needed than specific routines against specific
    viruses. This way, we can provide you better virus control and recovery,
    with longer intervals between the versions and let you be self
    sufficient in dealing with viral incidents. Does it make sense to you?

    Keep well and take care,

    Thank you Vesselin, you said it even better than I did at the NCSA

    InVircible, since I gave you a copy (then still V-Care) and it had BOTH

    of course.

    On this singular case, you are dead indeed! Is there anything you can
    do, except using a hardware solutions? Of course not!

    Michelangelo gets itself caught every time the computer is booted, which
    makes it about a thousand times on the average, before it triggers. So
    do all the rest. Now I'll suggest a harder one: all boot/partition
    infectors till now were easy to catch, since 'memory stealing' disclosed
    their presence. Now we have a whole lot of stealthy boot infectors, and
    Nika even does it without memory stealing!

    The next thing that will happen is this: an imaginative viropath will
    combine the Nika vehicle (stealth, and no self-disclosure by memory
    stealing) with a payload 'a la Michelangelo'. Computer's doomsday? Not
    the least. InVircible's SUBSTITUTE for the murderous AV TSR simply
    announces 'faked partition (or boot) sector' and it even samples it for
    the next generations to come. I tried lots of TSR, even Frisk's
    excellent Virstop against Nika, and nothing! Mind you, Nika is known
    here for at least nine month. Our NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS was
    one of its first victims. Nika is classical for TSR prevention. I would
    say that a carefully designed generic AV is superior on all fronts to
    TSR prevention or scanner. The trouble is that for some reason people,
    yourself included, attribute 'generic' only to integrity checking and
    restoration. Where from was this stupidity taken?

    Generic in my understanding is any technique that will assist in the
    detection that there is a viral process going on. It may consist of
    baits (as was copied from my early product into other semi-TSR - since
    the baits are launched only once, with the loading of the TSR, it is not
    really a TSR), memory stealing sensing, piggy-backing sensing, BIOS int.
    derouting, and of course integrity checking (NOT plain checksums or
    CRC) and a few more proprietary processes.

    Generic anti virus proved to be safer, much more efficient and cheaper
    than old fashioned TSR and scanners.

 VB> which in some cases might be too late.

    This cliche is used too often. Let's elaborate on this one:

    We all know that viruses are made to propagate. DANGEROUS OR 'LETHAL'
    VIRUSES DO NOT PROPAGATE AND DO NOT BECOME WIDESPREAD BECAUSE THEIR
    PROPAGATION IS A DECAYING PROCESS! They are self destroying and each
    subsequent generation infects LESS computers. So the process dies
    out by itself. Now we are left only with the playful viruses! And these,
    you have plenty of time to catch them on the next morning and in the
    majority of cases, even the next week!

    I think it is about time that we, anti-virus producers and virus
    researchers stop scaring people with irrational statements, just to push
    idiotic products that take over the users machines and economically
    inflict more harm than do good. Millions of PC are now running 5 to 10
    times slower because of the good-for-nothing Vsafe TSR from DOS 6.0/6.2.
    Every junior virus writer knows how to deactivate Vsafe, as it is fully
    documented in Ralf Brown's interrupts listing! And what about the
    endless and futile scanning for viruses, run daily by millions like some
    sort of paganic ritual. We really got the world by the balls! Not to
    speak about a thousand dollars anti-virus NLMs for networks, which are
    completely redundant. File servers are fairly protected by the inherent
    network security and due to the fact that viruses are made to propagate
    almost only in DOS environment and on media with a DOS type file
    structure.

    Else,
    I certainly agree with you that even generic techniques need updating
    with new counter-techniques, as new viral technologies emerge. I never
    said the contrary. But I suppose you will agree that it is easier to
    keep pace by general techniques, than to assemble an intricate algorithm
    for every single pissed-on virus that was written in Kamchatka, and
    interests nobody except needless AV updates merchants!

    I read you'll be off Virnet for writing your PhD. My sincere wishes for

Hi there,

What exactly does it mean if F-Prot reports something like

c:\foo.com - infection: Tremor (?)
                               ^^^
I have only seen a message like this with Tremor, and VIRLIST.LST (new with
2.11) indicates that F-Prot is not able to remove this virus. So does this
"(?)" mean F-Prot has identified the virus properly, but can't safely remove
it? Or is it basically the same as "new/modified variant of"?

I also found that no antivirus program seems to be able to remove Tremor,
although Frisk is the only who clearly says so. However, I understand that
Tremor does remove itself from infected files, eg. when copying them to a
floppy or ZIPping them with the virus in memory. This is may be a dumb
question, :) but why can't antivirus progs utilize the virus' own technique
to remove it? Something to do with the polymorphism, perhaps?

We prefer to replace infected files with clean backups anyway, but I'm
curious. Thanks for any info.

Subject: Discussion of FIST 2 virus (PC)

One of our field office DOS machines became infected with the FIST 2
virus (I think).  Central Point Anti-Virus indicated this is the
infection.  The symptoms included corrupted files and directories,
invalid drive specification, etc.  No other virus detection incl. DOS
6.2 found the virus which made me suspicious but on the currupted
machine command.com for DOS_6.2 grew from 54K bytes to 55K bytes.
Also by sequentualy inspecting EVERY disk than came into that office
for the past 3-months we did find a WP_5.2 document with some very
suspicious code appended to the end of the document.  Without trying
to disassemble the code, I think this was the source.

Does anyone know anything about this virus?  What does it do?  Where
does it reside?  Can it be cleaned from a machine without
reformatting?  Has other scan software begun to find it?  Is
reformatting sufficient to clean it?  Now the big question, can it be
detected and cleaned from a rather large FOXPRO database?  11 months
of management information is in what may be an infected file.  While
we have backups, if we can't find it we don't know which backups are
infected.

Thanks for any input you may have.

I previously posted this note but never saw either a reply or the

When you turn on a machine with a floppy disk in the disk drive,
several things happen. Firstly, the power supply in the machine warms
up, and a timer starts. Once voltages have settled, the computer
begins its Power On Self Test routines, stored in a fixed location of
ROM.

At this point the CMOS is read in. Assuming that the PC is set up to
boot in a standard manner, the ROM code then examines the first floppy
drive to see if it has a disk in it. If it does, the contents of the
disk's boot sector is read into memory and executed.

I am sure that you will have seen the message `Non System Disk or Disk
Error...' - this is displayed by code located in the boot sector of a
non-bootable floppy disk. If Form were to infect this disk, it would
treat this boot sector as valid, and store it for later use. Thus,
when booting from an infected disk, the Form virus would be loaded
(which would infect the first fixed disk), following which the
contents of the `non-bootable' boot sector, and the message `Non
System disk etc' would be displayed. The golden rule is that any
floppy disk could contain a boot sector virus.

The only way for a boot sector virus to get off that floppy disk in
normal use is to boot from it. Get out of the habit of using the
three-fingered salute (Ctrl-Alt-Del) to your machine when it hangs -
remove the floppy first. Any disk, whether it be bootable or not, is a
potential hazard.

Most "good" scanners, one example being F-prot, use better searching

An example of this would be MSAV, which only scans the beginnings of files
to check for viruses.  This will catch most viruses, but it will also miss
a few.  (BTW MSAV is still slower than F-prot despite this 'feature'.)

F-prot is fast because frisk codes most, if not all, in assembly language.
Frisk also knows his stuff when it comes to fast searching algorithms-- adding
more signatures to the pattern search list does not appreciably change the
searching time.  McAfee uses a good algorithm that checks the whole file,
but it is slightly slower since McAfee is coded in C and uses a different
algorithm.

I'm not sure what makes ThunderByte so fast, but it sure is FAST!!
Unfortunately its detection rate leaves a bit to be desired.  (Good
heuristics, though!)

Yes, quality is the most important thing.  However, a slow scanner will not
get used as often as one that is quicker because who wants to sit around
while a scanner putters through all the files on the hard drive?  The use of
TSR scanners and integrity checkers has helped reduce the dependence on
scanners somewhat so the speed becomes less of a day-to-day annoyance.  Most
people are willing to wait if they already think they are infected.

Also, some businesses have a set routine for virus scanning.  A faster
scanner will be able to scan large network drives more quickly.  A speed
difference of 10 seconds between scanners for a small PC hard drive might
grow to several minutes on a gargantuan file server!

But you are right, all the speed in the world doesn't matter if the scanner
misses the infection.  If I wanted a fast scanner and didn't care about the
detection rate, I could write one in five bytes or less... :)

Scanners may have a choice of scan methods, with some tradeoff between speed
and accuracy of naming (yes, and possibly missing some viruses), but reviews
normally compare equivalent modes when rating virus scanners.

The speed can certainly be important, since users may scan less often, or take
the scanner out of the autoexec.bat (or whatever) if it is inconveniently slow.
