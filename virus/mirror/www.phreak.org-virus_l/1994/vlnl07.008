Right, but in the case of published software you can complain to the
publisher, sue them or trample on their toes, because they are known
and dont hide behind a cloud of anonymity as do virus writers. (Of
course that doesn't go for MicroSoft if you get problems with
DoubleSpace :-)

Subject: Statistics on virus infections

A couple of folks have asked about virus infection statistics.  We have
some simple statistics.  The organization has 80 LAN's with a total
population of 2,000 users.  Last year (1993) four percent of our users
reported to the Help Desk that they "thought they had a virus infection."
Three percent of our total user population actually proved to have a virus
which had to be removed.  The other one percent usually had PC
memory management or PC configuration problems, which they mistook for a
virus.

We have not had a single infection by a "good" virus.  Every virus
infection did some damage, and in some cases caused delays in projects
which benefit a large number of people.

I differ; we have no real clue about the demographics of virus writers.
Small personal samples prove nothing, and it would be nearly impossible
to acquire good statistics.  We have some rough clues from the members
of the subset of the virus-writer population that have been caught or
have boasted publicly about their activities, but that's it.  We have no
clue how many people write and release viruses and don't get caught
(though there are a *lot* of coding styles represented in the large PC
virus collections), and we have even less of an idea how many people
write and *don't* release viruses.

Personally I have absolutely no quarrel with those who write and/or test
and/or play with viruses in a carefully controlled environment, but as
soon as they release even a benign newly-written virus to virus
collectors of any sort, they've changed matters.  Why?  Because they
henceforth have no control over the spread of their creation, through
whatever channels.  And eventually a virus will appear in an anti-virus
reviewer's test set.  Which means that basically any competitive vendor
of anti-virus products will have to make sure that their product can
handle it.  Which means at minimum 50-100 bytes more bloat (including
documentation) for any product that can identify the virus by name.
Multiplied by, say, 1-10 million instances of detectors (probably an
underestimate).  And this happens even if the virus never appears on an
end-user's machine, and even if the virus isn't subsequently modified
maliciously by some miscreant, unknown to the original author.
(Warning, this is the biased point of view of a developer of an
anti-virus product, so you might want to ignore the paragraph that you
just read.  :-)

These sorts of insults have kept a lot of people out of this discussion.
Dishonesty and chicanery and shoddy overpriced products/services can be
found in most walks of life and professions.  (My will is just barely
strong enough today to resist naming professions.  :-) One unique (in
the software industry) problem anti-virus software has is the very short
development cycles, for products with wide distribution.  The only other
examples I have seen are the products that break commercial copy
protection schemes; they are a similar product, in that they embody
knowledge about a large amount of software known to the developers at
particular time, and they get "stale" fairly quickly, like fish left on
a shelf.  (Other examples of fast-aging products welcome.)

Even then, I still think you're wrong.  the way you are describing
your ystem infection, a file gets infected.  And, if a file gets
infected, then some resources are absorbed.  These resources, the disk
space, could have been occupied by a recently deleted file.  If
another program were to become infected before I write any more data
to the drive, then ti is possible that the remains of the deleted file
could be overwritten, and thus uncovereable.

Also, please describe in detail exactly what damage is.  I could say
writing to memeory damages a horribly written program.  You might
overwrite a section of my program or something.

I do not work for any antivirus company, I don't have any real
antivirus product otu (though I have written a few little things here
and there which I distributed freely some time back.)

People are edgy about a lot fo things.  It's quite possible that antivirus
people just happen to have morals that differ from yours and they think
they are doing humanity some good by trying to get rid of viruses that
inflict damage on other people.  Even if there were some completely
undamaging viruses, then they wouldn't have much purpose -- the system
would actually be better without them, because less resources would be
used.  And resources = $ in the real world.

Not an anti-virus virus.  Or rather, not *really* one.  There
are two notions of "virus" around, and their differences can
cause some confusion.

The formal mathematical notion of virus, developed by Fred Cohen
in his pioneering work in the field, is roughly "any data object
at one place in a computing environment that increases the
probability that a related data object will appear in the
environment at another place at a later time" (this is a rough
translation from math to English, and I apologize to Dr. Cohen
in advance, but I think it captures the spirit of the formalism).
This notion fits some parts of the immune system that we envision.
It also fits the beneficial programs that Mr. "Kohntark" refers
to.  But it also fits the XCOPY command, COMMAND.COM, and could
be stretched to cover this very post!  So while it's quite
useful in doing theory, it's not the notion that I think most
of us on VIRUS-L are concerned with.

The ordinary notion of "virus" as it's used on VIRUS-L is
something like "code desiged to spread from system to system
without the knowledge or consent of the system owner".  This fits
FORM, 1575, NVir, and the many other viruses that trouble current
computer users.  It does not fit XCOPY, COMMAND.COM, or any
component of our immune system design.  I consider the writing of
code designed to spread between systems without the system
owners' consent to be irresponsible; we would certainly not
include such code in a product!  So I'd definitely resist the
label "anti-virus virus" for the idea, to avoid confusion...

There has been a lot of comment in the press
lately regarding the agents to be used by
Telescript when it is released by General Magic.

I don't see these agents as viruses, but rather
self modifying worms.  I doubt if they even
modify there own code.

They seem pretty safe, yet powerful to me.  Anybody
got different ideas on their potential threat?  If
this isn't the correct group for this discussion,
where might I find interest?

Ok... I have no stake in the "business".  I'm just a student that likes playing
with computers. :)  I've only posted on Virus-L once before.  But I think
that I have a clear idea of what viruses do and are.

In my opinion, ANY computer virus sould be considered a threat.  Even if the
virus is know to be non-destuctive, there is always the posibility that
it "dislikes" my system.  Even if the damage is as slight as lost CPU time
or a file that I was going to delete any way, it's still taking SOMETHING.
If you think of your computer as a house, would you like it if something
occasionally moved things on you?  I think it would at least iratate me.
So, I don't care if there is *>ONE<* system that *>A<* virus can be on
without causeing damage.  That system might not be mine.

Now off that subject... I'd like to thank the people that responded to my
question about Windows viruses.  I guess I missed that September issue
while I was away for the summer.

The above description is written by somebody who at first claimed they had
written this virus but it wasn't a virus, then they claimed they hadn't written
it at all, despite distributing a virus killer which, in the documentation,
he admitted he had written it ;). (The virus killer claimed to kill 'all known
viruses' despite only listing about twenty or so, most of which the author
admitted he hadn't seen.)

The program is indeed a virus, the above excuse is ridiculous. Apart from
anything else, it did do damage. It made the monitor picture distort - just
a temporary software effect, but several people thought their monitors were
broken and wasted time and money trying to get them fixed.

more value both to our customers and to us in terms of continually improving
our product (Dr Solomon's). Testers must have a strong virus library and be
able to test products for all types of infection, including polymorphics, on
standalone PCs and across networks, and on DOS, Windows, OS/2 platforms.

This is a know bug as is indicated from the follwoing message on Compuserve:

#: 26522 S1/Virus Q&A
17-Jan-94  15:31:45
Sb: #26512-#New virus
Fm: Mike Albers(McAfee) 73321,2776
To: Mike McKercher 76467,771 (X)

Dear Mr. McKercher,

The [1008Drop] virus is actually a false alarm with indeed version 109 of SCAN,
I recommend for you to download SCAN 9.21V111, however this may not be
available currently, it will be put up on CompuServe shortly.

For now you can either remove the MODE.COM file, or maybe get version 9.21V111
from our BBS at (408) 988-4004.

Feel free to contact me if any problems occur.

Regards,

     Hi everybody!

     We have encountered an virus detection of SKISM 14 by Central Point
     Anti-Virus V2 beta 1.  The problem is that only this software give

I am looking for information on the Green Caterpilar virus.  I am taking
Brian Seborgs class on viruses and the project involves testing a virus
to see what it does.  The first step in the project is to decide what it
is supposed to do, and then I can test it to see what I can make it do

Thanks

Hi I've got a question, my hard drive's been acting funny lately, it seems
to get stuck sometimes when I launch an application such as chkdsk for DOS;
but then the program works after.  Could a virus cause the hard disk to do
this?  Comments, help would be greatly appreciated,

Thanks,

Your procedure seems to work - BUT:

  a) either the folks out there just have the virus active, and then it
     would be easier for them to use either the specific cure KILLMNK3,
     or one of the available scanners that can also do the trick of
     disinfection (a bit more difficult to get through, but easier than
     your procedure),
or
  b) the have already used the (some believe) universal remedy - FDISK /MBR,
     [DO'NT DO THAT !!] and then it is too late/complicated to do anything!

But it looks like - there is a need for a tutorial on the subject!

Maybe some editor somewhere might consider writing it for his  pulbication
and later maybe donate it to the FAQ!!

Subject: virus called JUS ?? (PC)

A user just informed me that a **brand new** computer, just installed
and never used was found to contain a virus identified by Mcafee Scan
V109 as JUS.  The user turned off the pc , then rebooted with a clean
write protected floppy (CWPF), and scanned the pc.  The scan then
indicated that four viruses were found.  She again turned off the pc,
and rebooted with a CWPF.  This time the computer refused to boot.  So
once again she turned it off, and back on. this time it booted and
scanned the computer only to find **no** viruses.  (This story, by the
way is second hand, I may have something events out of sequence, but
the jist of the story is correct,  I hope).

So, being the campus V-MAN ( a title I was given by my rather jovial
supervisor) I took a 2 clean, write protected floppies to the lab.
McAfees Scan V109 and F-PROT V2.10C, and scanned the computer twice.
Guess what?  No viruses.  I explained that if the computer was indeed
infected with a virus, it was probably a memory resident virus the died
when the PC was turned off.  But this does not explain why the PC
refused to boot, or why, when it did boot up, that scan identified 4
more viruses.  I also explained that is was possible the Murphy sent a
gremlin to plague us, and that the gremlin has now left.

Any one want to offer a now correct possibility?  And... can anyone
identify the virus JUS.  I found JOS and JUSTICE but not JUS.

Subject: TBAV 6.10 (antivirus) now available (PC)

Hi,

Recently, TBAV v6.10 was released. The file on the bulletin board
from Thunderbyte, and maybe on some internet-ftp-sites, however,
contained a small bug. This concerned the invocation of TbScanX with
the EMS parameters, without actually having EMS-memory available.
This bug was corrected in this release, which I'm going to make
available in the normal way.
NOTE: the version on the bulletin board is *not* updated. The
      version I have *is*. Thanks to Robin Bijland of ESaSS...

Second note: tbavx610.zip and tbavu610.zip are not available.
             They will become available (as v6.11 !) when TBAV
             v6.11 is released. This will be done in about
             three weeks..

Along with this release is one file (the main distribution):
   tbav610.zip       Complete version

Procedure:
1- Extract the files from the E-mail I get from ESaSS B.V.
2- Move the files to ftp.twi.tudelft.nl:/pub/msdos/virus/tbscan
3- Inform the TBAV list (that's you !)
4- Upload files to oak.oakland.edu, garbo.uwasa.fi and nic.funet.fi
   and inform the FTP Admins of the above sites
5- Inform USENET groups dut,twi.misc (local news), comp.virus
   (== VIRUS-L) and comp.archives.msdos.announce
6- sit down and relax :-)

As you read this, all steps have been completed (as of 94-jan-27)

Greetings,

BEGPAND.CVP  931111

                        3.4 Weird Behaviour

As I have mentioned, there are a great many things that computers do
which have nothing to do with viral programs.  People are all too
ready to cry virus for every oddity they see.

The truth is, most viral programs do not display any overt signs.
The viri that do are self-limiting, because they alert the user to
something wrong, and therefore get destroyed before they have a
chance to spread.  The Stoned virus, for example, is said to display
the message, "Your PC is now Stoned," on the screen.  It does--very
rarely.  The only time it might display is when the computer is
booted from an infected floppy disk.  Even then, there is only a one
in eight chance that it will display.  Once the infection is
resident on the hard drive, unless you boot from an infected floppy
disk again you will never see the message display.

The MacMag virus was said to display a "universal message of world
peace."  This, however, would only happen on the target date of
March 2, 1988.  At any time before that, there was no overt sign of
any change.  The Scores virus, on the other hand, did make some
overt changes to both folders and icons.  These changes, though,
were not very spectacular, and unless you knew the virus and its
effects, it was not something many users noticed.

Some changes, of course, are inevitable:  that is the idea behind
change detection software.  The Monkey virus affects the hard disk
such that, when the computer is booted from a clean disk, the hard
disk is inaccessible.  Of course, most security software does the
same thing.  Both Stoned and Michelangelo reduce the "total memory"
as reported by DOS.  Of course, a lot of computers do the same
thing.  High density disks infected by Stoned may become unreadable.
Of course, lots of disks become unreadable for no apparent reason.
Windows programs will refuse to run if infected by a virus.  Of
course, Windows seems to take random "time outs" anyway.

If you suspect a virus simply on the basis of odd behaviour, please
get a scanner and check it out.  Get a very new, very good scanner.
If you still want to report odd behaviour, please give all details
of your computer, your operating system, your resident programs, any
device drivers, and which specific antiviral programs you have used
to assess the problem.  Get the behaviour to reproduce, and give
specific details of how you do it.  (Reports of intermittent
oddities are almost useless.)
