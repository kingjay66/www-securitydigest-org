Purely as a mental exercise, howzabout a virus-like piece of software
that mimicked part of the functionality of the old "Spinwrite"
program?  It would glom onto as many disks as it could, check to see
if they were bootable, and then do a verbatim rewrite of the boot
sectors so that they'd never "age out" due to electomagnetic
degradation?

Of course, as things now stand (please note that modifying
statement!), I would defend myself vigorously against even this
"benign" virus because it gives people with a malevolent bent an easy
"in" to my system...

Just a thought, I now return you to the network in progress...

Hello everyone.

 I was wondering if there is a sort of reference list anywhere on the
internet that has the names and signatures of all the known viruses.
I would be very interested in getting a hold of it.

                             Sincerely,

Certainly your typical agent would not be a virus, or even a
self-replicating worm; it would just be an object that goes from one
place to another on a network.  But the interesting question is
whether or not someone could write a virus or worm for such objects.
Could there be a piece of code, for instance, that said "every day at
noon, make two copies of myself, send them to random destinations, and
then delete this copy" (a worm), or "look at the agent closest to me,
and insert my code into it if it isn't already there" (a virus).  I
don't know much about the security in the current TeleScript design,
so I can't say anything specific about it, In general, though,
active-agent systems have to be designed carefully, using principles
that are just beginning to be understood, if they are to be both
powerful and resistant to replicant attacks.

Subject: Re: good vs bad viruses

All of the messages that have been exchanged on the theory of whether
viruses are inherently "bad" or may be "good" simply don't have any
relevence in the real world.  Out here, where I work, if a scanned
computer shows a virus that computer is no longer available for staff or
public use until it has been cleaned (usually by me).  With more than 150
PC's being used in public areas we *cannot* and *will not* allow unauthorized
software on our machines.  I don't care how benign someone meant it to be,
it can still consume memory or disk space both of which are at a premium
already.  Therefore, any virus incident that occurs costs at the least
REAL money for my time (or the other staff member who cleans the computer)
and downtime for users (members of the public sign up at least a day in
advance for some of our computers and then must travel downtown to use
them).  This is in addition to the funds that are expended to purchase
anti-virus software, train staff, develop and maintain policies, perform
routine scans, and repair destroyed files and disks.  I can think of many
more productive ways to spend my time and the library's funds.

I am the responsible reseacher of Virus Test Laboratory of Finland.
I would appreciate comments on how to arrange virus test sets.
One problem is gathering new viruses.
I thought that one source might be Anti-Virus producers, which are willing to
co-operate. Is this the right thing to do it and how should I do it in an
objective way ?

Furthermore, it has also been used as the basis for two further viruses. One

Subject: Monkey Virus - Dead hard disk (PC)

I work at a university with about 100 PC's (386sx, DOS 3.3) in which
most of them are infected with the Monkey virus. My first question is
whether there is a systematic quick way to clean all of the infected
PC's by running a batch file and then installing the virus protection
program?

I also like to know if there is a program other than the sahreware
KILLMONK that would be helpful? We are in the process of purchasing
McAfee's virus protection package, however I believe it can only
detect the Monkey virus.

Finally, as I was testing KILLMONK to remove the Monkey virus on one
the PC's last Thursday, I followed its suggestion by typing fdisk
/mb(?). Since then, the hard disk is not bootable. I have removed and
restored the partitians several times, and the same problem occures.
Is there a solution to this problem?

I really appreciate any help in this, since I have very little knowledge
of removing this virus.

.when i use the VSHIELD that works in my autoexec.bat file i get
the following message:
	Can not find file c:\windows\win.ini
	VSHIELD Windows Messager is not installed

I'm using the /windows flag as I have done for older versions of VSHIELD.
My Windows directory is on my drive D:
My question is:  How do I correctly get VSHIELD to find windows on

I just upgraded to MS-DOS 6.2 and now scan says I have the Filler and
Isreali Boot Sector Viruses.  After some experimenting I narrowed the
culprit down to the new version of MSAV.  All my disks were clean, the
instalation disk too.  I tried MSAV with different options loaded, but
it seems to pick filler more then isreali.  I have reinstalled DOS 6.0
and there are no problems.Any one else have this happen?  I used the

Subject: Discussion of FIST 2 virus (PC)

One of our field office DOS machines became infected with the FIST 2
virus (I think).  Central Point Anti-Virus indicated this is the
infection.  The symptoms included corrupted files and directories,
invalid drive specification, etc.  No other virus detection incl. DOS
6.2 found the virus which made me suspicious but on the currupted
machine command.com for DOS_6.2 grew from 54K bytes to 55K bytes.
Also by sequentualy inspecting EVERY disk than came into that office
for the past 3-months we did find a WP_5.2 document with some very
suspicious code appended to the end of the document.  Without trying
to disassemble the code, I think this was the source.

Does anyone know anything about this virus?  What does it do?  Where
does it reside?  Can it be cleaned from a machine without
reformatting?  Has other scan software begun to find it?  Is
reformatting sufficient to clean it?  Now the big question, can it be
detected and cleaned from a rather large FOXPRO database?  11 months
of management information is in what may be an infected file.  While
we have backups, if we can't find it we don't know which backups are
infected.

Thanks for any input you may have.

Subject: FS5 possible virus warning (PC)

While updating my parents' system (I do a check once a year) I have
detected the "Cascade" virus in the memory plus in the main "COM"
files: COMMAND.COM, EDIT.COM, DOSKEY.COM and many others. The Cascade
virus, according to the list included in the McAfee (111) packet, is
a "COM" and "MEMORY" virus, but NOT an "EXE" virus. In other words,
it should not infect EXE files.

After removing the virus, I scanned all my parents' floppies.
And I found the virus on the 2nd floppy of the FS5 distribution kit.
Purchased in a big shop, it was original, write-protected copy from
Microsoft. The presence of the virus has been detected in an "EXE"
file! The diagnosis has been confirmed by the McAfee (111) and the
DOS (6.2) virus package from Microsoft.

As I have not followed the all story (I came in only at the last
chapter), I am not sure of what happened to that floppy. The dates
are correct, so I don't think that the file has been tampered by
someone outside Microsoft. And the "Cascade" virus should not have
infected an "EXE" file. So, my conclusion was: this virus was on
the floppy since the beginning. But I am not an expert in viruses...

I reported all this to Microsoft and their polite reply was:" We
check at the source all out floppies. The virus must have contaminated
your floppy after it left the factory".

Well, it's not a big deal. The virus was easy to remove and it took
"only" three hours to scan all floppies and files to be sure all was
fine. FS5 was running OK, just freezing from time to time (but this
could have been a problem with the memory, so I cannot relate it to
the presence of the virus). I still have the infected originals. I
suppose I can remove the virus, or stick 'em to the wall.

I have all the details (floopies serial #, purchase details etc...).
If you are interested, drop me a line. And, please, run your preferred
anti-virus scanner on the 2nd floppy of the FS5 distribution kit.

This is a non-standard name, and quite frankly it does not help much in
finding out what virus this is.  If you run F-PROT and/or DSAVTK, you
would get something much closer to a standard name, and then maybe somebody
could answer the question.

 Hello Fredrik,
   I am no expert in PC viruses/antiviruses, but I think you can/should
try F-Prot.
You can find it e.g. at: ftp.uni-hamburg.de
       in the directory: /pub/virus/progs
        and it is named: fp-210c.zip
   If you don't like it try the McAfee progs
       in the directory: /pub/virus/McAfee
Or ask your local archie server for the nearest antivirus ftp site.
Okay? Any further question?

Well, F-Prot's scanning engine seems more accurate, and F-Prot is also

Well, I would very much like to see something like this as well.  However,
I doubt anybody, anywhere can do this properly ....Well, maybe if Vesselin
was a bit more business-oriented :-)

One problem is financial - Maintaining the collection and doing the
testing is time-consuming.....one researcher and a copuple of assistants
might be able to do the job - add the cost of hardware and you end up with
at least 50.000 pounds per year....minimum.  The question is who would pay.
The vendors ?  The government ?  EC [yeah, why not... :-)] ?

Another problem has to do with independence.   It is nearly impossible for
anybody to claim that they are independent...just consider the VSUM fiasco.
Where do the viruses in the library come from ?  If they only come from a few
vendors, there is a certain bias, and I have VERY serious doubts that obtaining
viruses from "everybody" would work.

No, no, no !!!!
FDISK/MBR  restores only the MBR  and  n o t  the boot sector.
Therefore you must use the  DOS Sys command for removing the FORM-Virus.

Frank,
You are absolutely correct!  However, you must have seen that I had quoted
Virus.faq 4 times and was speaking in only "general" terms concerning the
use of FDISK/MBR, MDISK and the DOS.SYS Command.  I was directing the
"infected" to the FAQ for more detailed instructions on removing the virus.
However my redundant use of the word "or" made my advice "technicaly"
incorrect.  I stand corrected and humbled in the light of your wisdom "mein
gute Deutsche Freund, viele danke"!

Newer BIOS's on motherboards these days have a feature that can be enabled
which monitor writes to the hard drive (often called like, "boot sector
virus protection).  You have the option turned on.  This can usually
be configured from the CMOS setup options, if you don't want to see it,
then just turn it off.

It will also occur when you format floppies, as the boot sector of the
floppy is rewritten on a format.  Sys'ing a disk will also cause that
to come up.

Well, assuming you didn't have some anti-virus hardware/software installed,
and forgot about it, the answer is that there is no problem, and there is
nothing you need to fix.  Basically, the BIOS in your machine is set to
intercept all attempts to write tho MBR. This will prevent viruses like
Stoned, Michaelangelo etc. from infecting the machine, so it makes perfect
sense to have it enabled.

However:

  1)  Sometimes you really have to write to the MBR - in particular when
      running FDISK.  The BIOS will intercept this, and issue a warning.
      There is nothing wrong with this.

  2)  A virus might disable the virus check, by modifying the CMOS before
      infecting the MBR, which makes this somewhat useless against future
      viruses.

F-Prot is faster, is capable of cleaning more viruses, provides much
more accurate virus identification, has much more accurate
descriptions of viruses (though they are often pretty brief -- they're
not wrong), and has had a much better history (less false positives,
less hacks (any?), less bugs...)

The NoInt virus is based on the Stoned virus.  It is a pretty simple
MBR infector, it can be removed fromthe hard drive by booting from a
known clean write protected system disk and executing "fdisk /mbr"
from dos 5.0 or higher.  On floppies, it could be removed with the
sys command, but this will also take up abou 100K of space on the disk.

Most antivirus products are capable of cleaning this virus, such as
Norton AntiVirus 3.0

      One reason could be that you have AMI bios with the virus
      checker enabled. Go to advanced configuration and turn it off.
      Actually it is not a very good virus checker, it only spots
      writes to the master boot record, i.e. the first sector of the disk

I just wrote about this to the upcoming F-PROT 2.11 Update Bulletin,
here's a fragment from it:

F-PROT Support Informs: Common Question and Answers
- ---------------------------------------------------

When I was installing DOS 6.2 on my computer, I received the warning
"Boot sector write, possible virus. Continue Y/N?". What caused the
warning? Is my computer infected?

        All the newer AMI BIOSes give this warning when something tries
        to make changes to the hard disk's boot sector. The warning is
        justified, too, since it is able to prevent most boot sector
        viruses from infecting the computer.

        However, the DOS installation program must make some legitimate
        changes in the boot sector. You can either ignore the warning
        when you are installing the program, or turn it off for the
        duration. The warning can be switched off via the computer's
        Setup. Remember to turn it back on when you have completed the
        installation.

Hope this helps,
MH

Subject: re: Help in removing Monkey virus from hard disk (PC)

There is a small community college here in South Bend that has a
computer lab that was infected w/ the monkey virus. Unfortunately,
they used the FDISK/MBR option and now cannot restart their systems.
Is there anything that can be done to restore the MBR of their hard
drives. I'm thinking of something like Northon disk doctor or some
utility of that nature. Short of that, would it be possible to go in
w/ a disk editor and reset the information..

Thanks

Subject: Alternate infection method? (V-Sign) (PC)

Ran into a virus F-Prot 2.10(c?) calls V-Sign, and other programs call Cansu.

Since it is a boot-sector infector and was on a non-bootable disk, it had
partially corrupted a(n executable) file on that disk.  By trying to run
that program, I at least moved the virus into memory, and possibly
activated it there. (VIRHUNT reported the virus active in memory.)

I don't know my DOS file structure well enough to know if starting an EXE
(possibly) executes code in the 1st block of a file, and thus could run
a 'non-file infecting' virus residing there.  This might be an alternate
way to be infected with any (or some) boot virii.

Also, no disinfector I tried (F-Prot, Virhunt, Norton 2.1) repaired the file
to an properly executable state.  (It may not have been executable before
infection - the disk's source is unknown.)

Several questions:

Can anyone confirm/refute this alternate infection method?

Is disinfecting a boot infector from a file more prone to failure
than other disinfections?  (Yes I know backups are best:  In this case,
not knowing the source of the disk, running the infected file was desirable
to try to find the disk's owner. (I'm a programmer: this looked like a
utility from someone at work.)

Can someone send me a rundown of V-sign, so I can panic to the proper degree?
(Is there an informational server I could e-mail to for automatic info?)

How might I tell (due to the disinfection failures) if this might be a new
strain, and if so how (for a boot virus) and where should I send it?
(i.e. what ftp sites might have BootId or Checkout (from the FAQ).)

As always, thanks in advance...

   Release Notes:

   Vol.202, February 1994

   This volume adds two new sources: Fernando Bonsembiante of Argentina,
   who produces the publication Virus Report, and Richard Head, of Yasuko
   Amano Jade Corp, who translates the virus reports of the IPA in Japan.
   Both these sources provide information that is regional in nature.

   This report includes the MISiS (Zharinov,NIKA) which was omitted from
   Vol.201. It was reported in Israel by Anthony Naggs of the UK and BRM.

   Vol.201, January 1994

   The Ripper virus was reported by four participants last month. Formerly
   reported to be in Bulgaria and Finland, the virus is now verified in the
   UK (several reports), Ireland, Finland, and the Netherlands.

   New information from BRM adds some viruses to the second list that are
   verified in Israel. Note especially Necropolis, which, with Dir II and
   Frodo, represent over 75 percent of the reports received by BRM.

Subject: Cancellation of VSI94

Unfortunately it has become necessary to cancel the anti-virus
conference scheduled for 28-29 March in Philadelphia (aka VSI 94),
there was just insufficient interest.

						    Program Chairman

[Moderator's note: Sorry to hear that the conference was cancelled.
If anyone out there is maintaining a calendar of virus-related
conferences, seminars, etc., I'm sure that a lot of people would
appreciate seeing it here.
