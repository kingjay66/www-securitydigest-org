nearly impossible for you, not for me, those are more than small
personal samples, the population of virus writers is quite small and
it is not hard for anyone who is honest to get to know most of them since
they have their own 'circle.'

I'm a real world user, paranoid to the point of listening to this
conference, but no further. The only virus I've encountered was Form
. basically harmless ... and the scanner picked up the floppy before
infection anyway.

Two points:

For me, performance is part of functionality. Any virus therefore
affects my work, if only in a small way.

Any virus inserts itself on my hard disk without permission. I feel
very strongly about that. I have a bunch of hard/software that
occasionally clash with each other and TSRs that cannot live with each
other. If this can't be sorted out by commercial software houses, I
fear more problems from amateur-written viruses.

Viruses aren't evil incarnate ... but they should be eradicated.
I can't change the world, but I will try to maintain a virus-free zone around
my PCs.

From:    ktark@src4src.linet.org
Subject: A few truths

Unfortunately I cannot reply to all of those who have answered my posts.
I will summarize my answers in this one post.

1-It can be shown from an statistical study of the known viruses that
the great majority of viruses are not meant to be destructive.

Answers: Just because they are not meant to be destructive, does not mean
they aren't, the real world is different, 'wake up and smell the coffee',
theory and application do not correspond, etc.

2-Yes, I admit that a lot of viruses that are not meant to cause
destruction do cause it due to system incompatibilities etc.
But this feature is not exclusive to non malignant computer viruses,
I can show anyone who wants to see examples of commercial computer software
that cause destruction to data as bad as the worse destructive virus out
there.

The idea that associates computer viruses with instant destruction
was created by the few who have interests in creating fear and ignorance
in the users.
An ignorant user is prone to buying a high priced, overrated, under-tested,
buggy, commercial Anti-virus package.

I will quote the following article that appeared in 'DISASTER PREVENTION'
page 41, of PC TODAY, Issue PCT1 930315 (premier issue)

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"VIRUS - Viruses have been getting a lot of hype from the press lately,
probably because their stealthy nature frightens people. But according
to David Stang, a virus expert at the National Computer Security Association,
odds are that the average business will never get hit by one.
Stanh estimates that one in a thousand computers will acquire a virus in a
given year. And, he adds, 'Very few of those are damaging to the system.'

The really dangerous ones that maliciously eat away at your data are extremely
rare, says Stang. Most viruses are rather malign, like the 'Stoned' virus,
so-called  because it makes infected computers say, Your PC is toned, legalize
marijuana' when booting.

    " I have run thousands if smaple viruses on a machine, and I have never
gotten wiped out,' Stang says, downplaying the reputation of viruses as
computer killers.
"In fact, I often run them on the same machine I work on. Viruses have
been overrated as killing machines. We should not worry aboutlethal viruses
anymore than we should worry about a safe falling on our head.""
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The rest of the article explains how viruses work and how most viruses are
spread through unautorized copying of commercial software.
Also the article quotes Stang singing the praises to F-PROT as the product
he recommends, as it is offered through the NCSA BBS (202-364-0644)

This is a proof from someone who has cleaned more systems from viruses
than anyone posting in this group, against all of those who have been
saying that my theoretical ideas do not work in reality.
The virus threat is exagerated.
Non malignant viruses are not more destructive than any other type of
commercial software!

Subject: Computer Lab protections strategies

All of the academic computer labs at Lincoln University fall under me and have
been attacked by a virus (stoned monkey.)  We are dealing with the problem, but
I am curious to know what protection strategies are being used.  We are going to
place a number of 286 machines (one or tow) in each lab and require that all
diskettes be scanned on those machines prior to use in the lab.  We are also
going to allow students and staff to scan diskettes on those machines at any
time if they wish to check out their diskettes.  Our labs in question have LAN's
and we are looking into an anti-virus program such as Norton's to run on the LAN
to protect that machines.

Any other ideas???

We appreciate it!  *8)  The obvious technical slips were of
course generated after the information left us; the reporter
is (for instance) just using "data files" as a synonym for
"files", without realizing that he's injected new (and
erroneous) meaning.  And I doubt that anyone here made the
"one byte ahead" comment; we may, of course, have pointed
out that contrary to some previous predictions computer
viruses have not yet brought down western civilization!

Your other points are mostly quite valid; making a system
like this a reality will involve solving some hard problems
about integrity, trust, adjustment of heuristics, false
positives, and so on.  If it was simple, someone would
have done it long ago!  But as networks become faster,
more powerful, and more pervasive, it is our opinion
that something like this will be vital: if a new virus that
gets past the defenses can spread faster than humans can
analyze it and distribute information about it, we'll
clearly need some sort of -automated- detection, analysis,
and information distribution.

Of course computers in one company would not be set up
to blindly trust "erase all files that look like <this>"
messages coming from the outside!  But less drastic
messages, coming from more trusted sources, offer a
means to speed up and automate some things that may
need to be fast and automatic not tooooo long from now.

Richard Hosker writes:
>Norman Data Defense's ARMOUR was recently recommended to me as a "good

I thought ARMOUR was just a small part of the NDDS's Antivirus package.
A small program designed to catch viruses by behaviour instead of using
scanning or integrity-checking. It comes with the NDDS package as a device-
driver named NVC.SYS (correct me if I am wrong). And is probably sold as a
standalone AV-utility with the name ARMOUR.SYS (or maybe NVC.SYS).

>opinions, pro or con, regarding ARMOUR, and any pointers to published

As it is a behaviour blocker it will not be able to detect as many viruses as a
recent version of FSI's F-PROT or McAfee's Scan. But it should not be compared
to a scanner at all, since it is not a scanner itself.

> recognized and removed

I am not sure about its ability to remove viruses, but would expect it to be nonexistent,
since it is a tool for detecting viruses in general.

> , scanning

If we are talking about the same product, it does not use scanning at all. NDDS are selling
a scanner as a part of their package, but this has nothing to do with ARMOUR.

>speed, frequency of update releases,

No idea.

> ease of use by non-expert users,

If it works on your system, you will have few problems, and it will be very easy to use.
At least until you find a virus. Then you will probably need another program to identify
and remove the virus. But I am not 100% sure about this.

>general reliability of disinfection routines,

Don't know about this, but would expect it to be unable to disinfect most viruses it detects.
Much of the point is probably to stop a virus-infection before it get spread on your machine,
so only the infection-source will need disinfection or replacement. How much you can rely on
ARMOUR to stop any virus infection, I don't know. But behaviour blockers in general is not
a very secure solution. An advanced new virus could easily bypass it, but it will probably
be very effective against stupid new ones (e.g., variants of old viruses).

> lack of false positives, etc.?

The first time I tried it (Jan. 1994) I experienced a false positive with it. I used a file named
NVC.SYS, dated 01.06.94, and it claimed the test-machine to be infected by a boot-infector.
It gave me three possible options, whereof one was to disable the virus in memory, then
continue booting. When I tried this, it crashed. Also, after coldbooting, I realized that the CMOS
Data Area got wiped in the process ;-(

Armour might be a useful antivirus utility when used together with other antivirus tools, like
a scanner, a scanning TSR and maybe some kind of integrity checking. But behaviour blockers
in general, was abandoned by most antivirus experts 2-3 years ago.

There are two reasons why a behaviour blocker is  a bad idea:

        1)      It is hard to avoid false positives
        2)      It is hard to avoid false negatives

1) can be explained like this: Many programs behave much like viruses, and will therefore be
flagged as such. To avoid this, one could register the exceptions in a database, but then if
one of the exceptions gets infected the infection will not be flagged as a virus ;-(

2) can be explained like this: Behaviour blocker checks for general virus specific behaviour.
Some viruses don't do anything "virus-specific", but acts just like a normal program, and will
thus not be flagged as virus (a false negative). Other viruses eployes new techniques not
checked by the behaviour blocker. And last but not least, some virus techniques CANNOT
be stopped, or detected upon execution.

Conclusion: Because of a general high number of false positives and negatives it is not a good
idea to use/write a behaviour blocker. Scanning and integrity checking boosts higher detection
rates, and causes fewer false positives. It is very much like the discussion on antivirus
- -viruses:
It CAN be done, but other techniques can always do it BETTER.

Subject: VDS 3.0g Updated (PC)

   Hello everyone,

The new VDS (Virus Detection System) 3.0g Shareware Edition is available on
Simtel-20 and some of its mirrors; the file name is VDS30G.ZIP.

This release of the package is intended to allow potential customers to
evaluate the suitability of the product to their needs. It is a fully
functional copy that lacks a few features of the Pro version (see the docs
for details). Most of the package is re-written to address some of the
compatibility issues that emerged within the last year. VDS is now Windows 3.x
and DoubleSpace(TM) compatible, and it offers better network support.

VDS 3.0g includes a fast virus scanner, a robust integrity checker with
anti-stealth capability, a generic virus remover, external signature support,
emergency diskette preparation, a very versatile decoy launcher, a low-level
disk recovery tool, readable documentation, excellent Netware support (not
just compatible), automatic and semi-automatic installation (with de-install
feature), and a redesigned object-oriented (seriously) user interface.

VDS 3.0 emphasizes integrity checking, but also provides known virus scanning.
Its catalog-based integrity database supports both DOS drives and Novell
volumes. Newly-added installation program simplifies protecting workstations
by offering complete electronic distribution and configuration options. Once
in place, VDS can perform periodic (user-definable) integrity checks and
scans without further user intervention.

System requirements:
   IBM PC compatible computer
   Hard disk (for integrity checker) with 1024K free space
   384K of memory available
   Optional 192K extended memory for large catalogs
   MS/PC-DOS 3.0 or later

If you are looking for a comprehensive and up-to-date anti-virus package,
we invite you to try VDS. It's only an FTP away! Let us know what you think.

You may, in fact, NOT have a virus.  Read the text carefully.  It says Boot
sector write.  Now, since you said you reformatted the HD, I can only assume
you had no memory resident virus protection program running (i.e. Vshield,
NAV, etc.), so this sounds like hardware virus protection.  It is probably
alterable via your CMOS setup.  Of course you should expect a warning from
things like FDISK, and FDISK /mbr since these are, in fact, writing to the
boot sector.  So, get scan v111 (I think it's newest right now) and if it
doesn't find anything, then I would begin to think that it's just your
motherboard being cautious.

Subject: FIST 2 Virus (PC)

One of our field office DOS machines became infected with the FIST 2 virus
(I think).  Central Point Anti-Virus indicated this is the infection.  The
symptoms included corrupted files and directories, invalid drive
specification, etc.  No other virus detection incl. DOS 6.2 found the
virus which made me suspicious but on the currupted machine command.com
for DOS_6.2 grew from 54K bytes to 55K bytes.  Also by sequentualy
inspecting EVERY disk than came into that office for the past 3-months we
did find a WP_5.2 document with some very suspicious code appended to the
end of the document.  Without trying to disassemble the code, I think this
was the source.

Does anyone know anything about this virus?  What does it do?  Where does
it reside?  Can it be cleaned from a machine without reformatting?  Has
other scan software begun to find it?  Is reformatting sufficient to clean
it?  Now the big question, can it be detected and cleaned from a rather
large FOXPRO database?  11 months of management information is in what may
be an infected file.  While we have backups, if we can't find it we don't
know which backups are infected.

Thanks for any input you may have.

Joel, the McAfee stand-alone scanner is excellent and is frequently updated.

So is F-Prot.

Both have about the same detection rate.

As NLMs for a NetWare fileserver, there is an order-of-magnitude difference
in their burden on the fileserver utilization--Net-Prot wins by a VERY wide
margin--the McAfee should ONLY be used on a fast 486 or Pentium machine, and
NEVER, NEVER turn on 'on-access' scanning for all files..your fileserver
will crawl like a slug on drugs..

Subject: Writing to boot sector - AMI BIOS (PC)

Jukka, the message you recieved is from the AMI BIOS.  It is a protection
scheme which warns you every time an INT 13h is used to write in the boot
area.  It isn't implemented very well, especially since they don't tell
you what is producing this message...  A simple  (c)19xx American
Megatrends at the bottom of the screen would be less intrusive, for sure.

I had a call not too long ago about this very problem.  The poor fellow
had reformatted his drive repeatedly, and then even from a friends disk,
which also seemed to have this "virus".

By the way:  Run the BIOS SETUP program (where you press <del> at the
boot up).  In the advanced setting section, the last option is "Virus
Protect" or "Boot Sector Protection" or something like that.  Turn it off
and you won't see that message again.

I'm looking for the email address for Kevin Dean. He is the creator of
the Stealth Bomber version 2.2 (formerly CRCSET). I would like to ask him
if his code has been ported to a window based application if it has not I
would like to write it in either visual basic or in turbo-pascal for
windows. Any infomation would be a help.
The Stealth Bomber is a crc virus checker program.

Yes indeed, that is exactly what will happen.  The "Non-System Disk"
message that you get when you boot a "non-bootable" disk is in fact
a program that loads from the floppy.  A "data" floppy without the
operating system will readily infect your system if you leave it in
the boot drive and reset your system.

No.

Yes, you should.  You can safely copy the data files to new floppies,
then reformat or destroy and discard the infected ones.

Subject: FAQ? Norton & PKUNZIP (PC)

We/ve been having fun with an apparently infected copy of PKUNZIP.EXE.
Norton Anti Virus detects a variant of Maltese Amoeba, but Dr Solomon
and F-Prot don't, despite the latter listing Maltese Amoeba in its
library.

I seem to remember, may be a year ago, a thread in which Norton was
described as producing a few false positives - was it with PKUNZIP.EXE?

The file size is 28806 bytes, and it's dated 28-12-92. I deduce that
this is not the safe, official release 2.04g or 1.10 as the size and
date are wrong, so I won't use it, but is it really infected?

On the other hand, is this a Norton bug or do I get Norton instead of Dr
Solomon or F-Prot?

In some confusion,

Bill.

Today when i went to use my Printer a cuious thing happened.
When i turned on my printer on, it started printing a letter as soon
as it came online.  What it was printing was a letter by a supposed
person, John Dickinson to and Arthor DeAuthor.  Obviously a prank
of somesort.  I checked for a virus with CPAV and also looked for
several strings from the letter with Grep.com, and found no trace of
it. has anyone else seen this before?  BTW the date on the letter was
1984, and it has a reference to 8088's

There is a parity check virus -- it's a partition table virus.  I had it
(indeed I got it from a Dell support rep who came by to replace a drive
and infected my system).  I have a vague recollection that Central Point
AntiVirus (which I no longer use) did not detect it, but that SCAN and
F-PROT (which I now use did).  McAfee's CLEAN can clean it.  I'f ftp one
of those checkers if I were you and scan with them.  And then erase CPAV
and use them exclusively.

Here is the situation:

Current virus package site licence expires end of March
Currently have in excess of 3000 pcs, from 8088 to 486DX2/66.
Currently running DOS ver 3.3+ to DOS 6.2.
Currently running Windows 3.1.
Currently have 5 - 8 Novell servers (3.11) with approx 300 users.
Currently running 2 Banyan servers (ver unknown, users unknown).
Expect 2 -4 additional Novell 3.12 servers 50 - 100 users each

My boss, god bless his soul, said Dave, we need to write an EPR for
an antivirus package.  The one we use is to expensive, and I saw same
questionable reviews on it.  Give me some choices, and I need it
yesterday!

God bless his soul.

So, fellow antivirus hounds, how 'bout helping me out.

I sure would appreciate it if some of you could help me narrow down
the possibilities.

We need a site licence that will cover all the above; PC DOS, WIDOWS,
NOVEL NLM(VLM), BANYAN ???.  One very critical requirement is memory.
With all the drivers loaded in to memory, and all the TSRs and whatnot,
we need a program the uses very little memory.  Another important
requirement is command line operations.  We don't want glitzy graphic
displays.  For the most part we want all users to be protected with out
their knowing it!

Last we want the best for the least, and my boss wants it now!

God bless his soul!

Seriously, any help, suggestions, recommedations you care to make will
be appreciated.

Please email me directly, as I don't always have the chance to read the
digest sent to me.

If any one wants, I will summerize and post the results as soon as time
permits

Subject: Is it a virus or not! (PC)

Hello World,

	Just had a machine spit itself, and my new McAfee scan (v111) didn't
find anything, but some of the files have HiJaak 2 written in them.  Is this
a virus, or has the crash and Nortons conspired to throw me right off.  I
just installed QPro for Windows when the machine went haywire blowing away
my CMOS setup.  This then tried to write to disk and resulted in a lot of
data loss.  I fixed up the cmos (No easy thing on a portable with software
CMOS setup programs that have been destroyed) and got the machine working
again, but had lots of cross linked chains and so on.  When I ran Nortons
Disk Doctor It recovered the lost data to files (160 of them) which nearly
all contain the words "HiJaak 2" and "Awesome" in them at the begining.  Is
this just Nortons work or a new virus.  The McAffe Doc's don't mention a
HiJaak viruse, and dosn't pick up anything as a virus but then with the
amount of work Nortons had to do It could simply have killed it off.

	Any suggestions as to what went wrong (virus or user error) would be
very much appreciated.

Well, it depends of course, on he scanner.  Most real AV products aren't
"scanners" but more like intelligent searchers.  While it is possible for
some viruses, say, Darth Vader, to infect a file in the middle, the
actual execution of the virus must be done at some time.  Various
programs trace up to the program's begining of execution (which can
be easily obtained), and then check from there.  Viruses like Commander
Bomber pose serious scanning problems.  McAfee scans entire files for
this virus (though it only infects .COM files.)  This slows it down quite
a bit.  I am not too sure how the other products detect this.

Another is just the method that they use to scan -- TBSCAN, for example,
uses a really fast 'scanning' engine.  And, once again, these are not
usually just a big blob of constant data, like, "B8 34 12 90" or somthing
stupid like that, but can have actual pseudo-intelligent 'scanning'
methods, so maybe it skips over certain sections of the code or can
predict things.

                            Announcing F-PROT 2.11

   This version adds detection/identification of more than 450 new viruses,
   compared to 2.10.  It identifies 3173 different viruses and also detects
   viruses belonging to 183 other families, giving a total of 3356.

Disinfection:
   F-PROT can disinfect 2644 (78.8%) of those viruses, but another
   279 (8.3%) cannot be removed at all, as they overwrite or destroy the
   victim.  This leaves 433 (12.9%) viruses that this version cannot
   disinfect, but that number will hopefully be reduced in the future.

Identification:
   This version identifies 1015 (30.2%) viruses exactly, meaning that it
   should detect even single-bit changes in the virus code.  It does not
   attempt to identify viruses belonging to 183 (5.5%) families, but should
   be able to identify the remaining 2158 (64.3%) viruses with sufficient
   accuracy to avoid corrupting them when disinfecting, because of a
   mis-identification.

We have now installed an e-mail update service for users without FTP access,
that would like to obtain the latest version of the F-PROT shareware product
directly from the source.

To use this service, you send an E-mail message to f-prot@complex.is

This is an experimental service and currently only the following commands
are offered:

send-to: email-address          (required)
send-as: form                   (optional)

The commands must be located at the start of the line, and whitespace is
not allowed at the end of those lines.

'email-address' must be a valid E-mail address of the recipient.

'form' must be one of:  'uue' or 'xxe' and shows how the file should be
encoded.  It defaults to 'uue'.
