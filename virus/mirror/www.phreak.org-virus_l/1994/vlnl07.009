Yes it would prove it wrong in an entirely non pratical way.
I might say ALL viruses which standa any chanc of ever escaping into the
wild are dangerous and potentially destructive. The measures required
to safely contain such a virus makes the concept meanigless except for
the express purpose of finding out enough a bout a virus to kill it.
This however is verbal diarrhoea. The above quoted statement
about virus is much more succinct and clear.

I have no financial stakes in the matter. Viruses ARE BAD.
Ther are NO good Viruses. Good Viruses are not possible.
If you have a virus that is apparently good it is not wise
to release it anywhere. Being not wise, it is also not
good to release it, and this is near enough in my book
to the only good virus is a dead one.

I first thought of viruses a number of years before they
escaped in the wild. I thought of all sorts of ideas
for viruses which have of late surfaced in real viruses.
I considered hunter/killer/doctor viruses. I thought
about many things, I wanted to believe in them, I wanted
to write one but I could find NO wise way to do so.
In the end I concluded the idea was not even wise to
think about because if I get  Really good idea how to
write a really efficient virus I may be tempted to tell
people and then I will sow the seeds of my own discontent.
Not wise. Bye.

I would venture to say that (save hueristics) antivirus programs
(scanners) are generally managing to stay one byte "behind" today's
viruses.  Not all of which I would classify as primitive (IMO, even
the Brain virus was "modern" in it's time).

Heuristics, huh, I like A-I, but how do they get rid of false positives -
especially, if they are broadcasting to the network your PC is infected.

Ah...so IBM is creating decoy "data" files.  We all know that data
files are the number one cause of spreading infection :) I hope the
algorithm doesn't tell the network that my word processor is a virus.

I just hope they don't pick up "Microsoft Word 6.0 Document" as a
signature :)

I would be very leary of using anything like this in today's world.  I
don't know if I would ever trust a network message that tells my pc to
modify files.
 If this is the wave of the future, you wouldn't need viruses, just
create a timebomb that would broadcast a fake message to modify files
on March 6th. :)

Since this did come from an article and not IBM, I give IBM the
benefit of the doubt that the errors/misinterpretations are from the
reporter.  Can David Chess elaborate on this project?  I understand
the reasoning behind it, but I am interested to know more about the
security and liability problems. Just imagine two rival corporations
hooked up to this proposed information superhighway, one sends out a
message that all files containing a string, of say "CD21" or better
yet a string of nothing but wildcards, have been infected by an
overwriting virus - please automatically delete these files.  This
would take longer to recover from than any viral attack and then what
about the legal implications when they trace it back to their rival
(the list of defendents would be a mile long).

By the way, when I originally saw the subject, I thought, finally all
of Padgett's "soapboxing" has paid off, somebody has implemented his
BIOS protection plan.  Oh well, maybe next time...

Bill Bauserman                                        This is entirely my
own opinion.

Subject: Beneficial Viruses

A recent article out of the Houston Post by Eric Hanson entitled
"Houston Realtors try new system to keep keys out of thieves' hands"
discusses beneficial use of viruses.

In the article, Lynn Zarr, president of the Houston Association of
Realtors explains that it is a common practice of thieves to case
homes on the market via Realtors.  When they find a home they wish
to burglarize they obtain the code for the lockbox via illegal means.

Quoting the article, "In the new system, each of the 10,000 Realtors
will be issued an electronic keypad, about the size of a makeup compact,
which fits into the lockbox attached to the house for sale.  After
punching in a personal code number, the Realtor slips his coded keypad
into the lock box, causing a small opening to appear and the key to
drop out."

"Zarr said the new system has several other security features.  For
one, it includes a mechanism for quickly spreading a lock out virus
throughout the computerized system should a keypad be lost or stolen,
Zarr said."

The newspaper article states that installation of the boxes has begun
and that approximately 53,000 computerized lockboxes will be installed
in the Houston area with a cost of about US$3.5 million.

(Hey, I just reported what the newspaper article said.  Contact the
Houston Association of Realtors if you have any flames.  I have the
complete newspaper article if someone is interested.)

Are you speaking of generic *detection* (integrity checking) or
generic *disinfection* or both??  If we consider generic detection,
the original version of Untouchable (known then as "VirAlarm") was
released in the spring of 1988, which would make it almost 6 years
old.  (You speak of only 5 years for your product.)

Again, no distinction between detection and modification.  You are
probably correct that V-CARE was the first product which used generic
disinfection.  But that doesn't mean that "Untouchable or V-Analyst
learned the system from you"!  I think you attach far too much impor-
tance to your role in this.  (I spoke to someone at BRM about this.
He said that at one point they did take a look at V-CARE, but all that
they learned was how *not* to implement generic disinfection.)

Vesselin's question was a serious one and you reply by comparing it to
absurdities.  Apparently such a virus doesn't yet exist, but your
reply is an evasion, not a serious answer.

First, how can you speak of a speed without mentioning the *machine*?
Secondly, it's no trick to produce fast scans if you SKIP MOST OF THE
FILE.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that's what your program
does.

  I could mention a few drawbacks to the V-CARE package, but they
would be based on the package as I tried it several years ago.  I have
no idea to what extent you've improved it since then, so it would seem
unfair to judge your present package by your former one.  On the other
hand, you keep telling us that nothing in your software has changed
during the last 5 years, so maybe the drawbacks are still relevant?

  Oh yes, the most interesting program in the V-CARE package I saw was
V-GUARD.  I get the impression this is no longer part of V-CARE.  If
not, why not?  And what happened to your philosophy of not including
any TSRs in your package?

In the last VB comparative review, F-PROT scored 100% against our
three test-sets (Viruses in the wild, A 'Standard' set of viruses, and
MtE), with a scan rate of 180 KB per sec. SCAN scored 92.6% (In the
wild) Standard 98.1% and 100% against the MtE, though it was very slow
(only 54.2 KB per sec).

Both products seem to be okay, but for the money... well, draw your own
conclusions :)

  MSAV is full of security holes.  For details, ftp to CERT.ORG, cd to
pub/virus-l/docs/reviews/pc, and download the file radai.msav.  You'll
find 10 holes in MSAV mentioned there.  Here's an abbreviated version
of some of them:

1. It's trivial for a virus to disable VSafe.  All it has to do is load certain
   values into the AX and DX registers and call a certain interrupt, and voila,
   VSafe either has all its options disabled or is completely unloaded from
   memory (depending on the value loaded into AX), without the user being aware
   that his protection has disappeared.  This trick is used by the Tremor virus
   [and by at least 3 others since that was written].

2. While VSafe's generic monitoring detects most viral modifications to already
   existing executable files, it does not detect creation of a new executable
   file (important for detecting companion viruses), modifications made to a
   file with a *non*-executable extension, or renaming of files.

6. Companion viruses do not modify existing files, but create new ones which
   get executed before the target program.  The integrity checking of MSAV and
   VSafe does not detect infection by this type of virus.

7. A simple way for a virus to defeat the integrity checking is to alter the
   checksum database, deleting the entry (name and information) for a file just
   before infecting it.  An even simpler way is to delete the entire checksum
   database.  The user will notice nothing unusual since if a database is
   deleted, MSAV will simply start creating the database anew as if one never
   existed, this time using the *infected* files as a basis for future
   comparison instead of the original ones.  Viruses which exploit this
   weakness are the Peach, Groove, Encroacher, and Twitch viruses.

8. A good checksum algorithm for AV use will be based on different (unknown)
   keys for different users.  MSAV/VSafe does not do this.  Thus even if it
   were impossible to delete the database or any of its entries, it would still
   be possible for a virus writer to incorporate the checksumming code from
   MSAV.EXE or VSAFE.COM into his virus, so that after infecting a file, it
   could compute the checksum of the infected file and modify the checksum and
   file length in the database according to the new values.

9. To increase speed, MSAV and VSafe do not checksum the entire file, but only
   its first 63 bytes.  Thus a virus which alters only other parts of the file
   and preserves the file size, date/time, and attributes will not be detected
   by the integrity checking of MSAV or VSafe.  Considering that there are
   viruses (e.g. ZeroHunt) which preserve the size and viruses (e.g. LeapFrog)
   which avoid modifying the beginning of files, it would not be difficult to
   write such a virus.  Another way of exploiting this loophole would be to
   overwrite the scan strings within MSAV.EXE and/or VSAFE.COM, thus rendering
   the scanner completely ineffective.  The integrity checking of MSAV/VSafe
   would not notice the modification.

Subject: Is speed really important? (PC)

I have read and heard about how fast some antiviral scanners are. My
question is with all of this so called speed is it possible to be
missing some infections? Are some scanners not scanning the entire
file to increase speed? Being that some viruses can enter a file in
the front, middle or end and in some cases anywhere how can a scanner
that does not scan the entire file find all infections? F-Prot and
ThunderByte are very fast scanners compare to McAfee. Does McAfee scan
the entire file while F-Prot and Thunderbyte don't? I mean really
isn't the quality of the scanner really what's important and not that
it can scan a hard disk in "X" seconds?

Subject: Case History of a False Alarm (PC)

I had a virus scare yesterday.  It was a false alarm, but I
thought others might benefit from my experience.

I'm running Windows 3.1 and PC Tools.  Central Point Software,
the vendor of PC Tools, released a new DLL, WNFSV1.DLL, to allow
you to view files zipped with version pkzip, version 2.04.  I
downloaded the file and installed it.

After a couple of days, I rebooted my computer, and MSAV noted
that WNFSV1.DLL had changed.  Being suspicious of this, I ran
F-PROT.  I was an older version, but I ran it anyway.  It told me
I had the Telecom virus in memory.  Now, I was getting really
scared.

So, I booted from a clean disk, then went out to get the latest
version of F-PROT.  I ran this, and everything looked cool. So, I
booted up from the hard disk, running MSAV in the process because
it was in my AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  Again, it reported that
WNFSV1.DLL had changed. Yikes!  At this point, I deleted the
file.

I ran F-PROT (this time the latest version) again.  This time it
said that it had found traces of the Telecom virus, but this time
the error message said that this was probably because I had run
MSAV or CPAV since booting the computer.

So, apparently, this was all a false alarm.  I reinstalled the
WNFSV1.DLL, reran F-PROT, and everything looks clean.  I don't
know why MSAV said that the file had changed.  I would have
expected the attributes to change when I copied the .DLL file
from the floppy disk, telling MSAV that the change was OK.
Apparently, the attributes didn't change, maybe because the file
name is the same.

I think in the future, I'm going to use just one anti-virus
program.  Playing around with two of them, each giving
you different results is not good for the nerves.  I also think
I'm going to make F-PROT my standard program.  You can't beat the
price, and updates are readily available.

I'd be interested in any comments any of you out there might
have.

Subject: Form. Should it be Hated and Feared?? (PC)

Recently, we received a batch of disks from Motorola that were
infected by PC Form virus.

Since these are not bootable disks, I was not overly concerned that
the safety and security of the computing world may be in jeopardy.

Then I started thinking... What happens if I leave a Form infected
non-bootable disk in the drive and reset the pc??  Will it be released,
so that it may hatch some insidious plot on my HD?? Is there any other
way it can creep into my machine other then booting off the floppy??

Should I be treating this virus with more respect???  Inquiring minds
WANT to know.

Subject: Virus affecting keyboard? (PC)

I have some type fo virus on my PC that is listed as the NOINT version
of the STONED virus.  I cleaned off the hard drive, and all floppies,
repeatedly but could not clean it totally.  Finally, I had to do a low
level format of the hard drive (upon advice froma haced friend and
COMPAQ).  The interesting thing is that once the virus came aboard, I
could not use the shift key.  Even if I booted from a clean floppy,
the shift key would not work.  Interestingly the diagnostics disk
allowd the shift key, and there were no prob lems.  But anything other
than that...no shift key.  Any ideas?

Subject: Location of Virus Simulator Files (PC)

TO: ALL VIRUS-LIST Readers:

I recently posted some file information/location that was incorrect.
I had earlier stated that the following files could be retrieved by
ftp.mcafee.com :

                 VIRSIM2C.ZIP
                 VIRPRES2.ZIP

McAfee has the virus simulator listed as VIRSIM10.ZIP and VIRSIMUL.ARC.
It can also be found via ftp at oak.oakland.edu.  The virus presentation
program <VIRPRES2.ZIP 220,569 Bytes> can be downloaded from Computer
Security BBS at 303 962-9536.  The virus presentation program is directed
at the virus "novice" or the K-12 group.  It serves a purpose but is not
a source of serious virus information.

I apologize to anyone who may have wasted valuable FTP time looking for
the files.  If you are unable to FTP these files and ABSOLUTELY have to
have them, post me your snail-mail address and I'll try to send them to
you on floppy as long as our floppy supply lasts.  Sorry, 5 1/4" only!!

I am new with the comp.viruses-newsgroup, so I do not know whether my

question. Sorry, if so.

I downloaded some files from nic.funet.fi -ftp site and after zipping

started behave like I would have painted with paintbrush.

I made a hard boot, boot with absolutely clean system disk and scanned

Any hints? Some well-known virus? What to do?

Our resident PC Virus guru says F-Prot wins all the head to head
comparisons. My position as a support rep is that even if they're only
close, I prefer F-Prot because: it is MUCH easier to use; therefore
people in the field are MUCH more likely to actually use it.

Here is a puzzle for you...

A student reported to our computer services group that they had found
the "Beethoven" virus on one of their diskettes, and that when they
scanned the computer in our lab, it had it too.

We don't know what program he was scanning with, but our MacAfee
finds no virus on the indicated computer.  MacAfee tech support
reports not knowing of a Beethoven virus.

Can someone tell me if they've heard of it, what can find it/clean it,
and what other name it might be called?

I seem to have a problem with this software Luckly it was not with a
very harmful virus.  I was quiet supprised to see that this program
whould execute after it had become infected.  It even detected itself
as being affected.  One plus to it I noticed is that it whould NOT try
to disinfect itself but made no reference as to not use the program
anymore or to do anything else.  Oh well.. jsut thought somone out
there might be instrestred...

One other thing I might even get flamed for this but oh well.  Over
break (christmas) I had some NuKE newsletters that I had been reading
and i enjoyed them.  Most of them seemed to be fairly old, so I
started looking for some newer ones.  I cant seem to find them.  Now i
doubt that most of the AV ppl will tell me where to find these
newsletters but maybe some of you non AV ppl that read this group for
info might be able to help me out..  IF so Please e-mail me..

I am working with three colleagues, we all have different laptops.  Over the
past month, we have all begun to get a "parity check" error when we press the
"caps lock" key while running an application, such as Microsoft Excel.  It just
seems too coincidental that four people at the same site should fall prey to the
same affliction in such a short time period....we have shared floppy disks in
the past, that seems to be how it has spread....just today, a colleage not
working with us directly also experienced the same problem, shortly after
sharing a floppy disk with us.....

any ideas? we have checked all our machines and disks with Central Point
Anti-Virus to no avail - it doesn't find any signs of a virus.

Subject: Aurora text editor bug/virus/problem (PC)

Hi,

	There is a text editor called Aurora, which when installed
contains 15 files.  Lately I have noticed that when I go into a
directory that is empty and use Norton Utilities "fa" command which
displays the file attributes of the current directory I get the 15
files used by aurora.  I never worried too much.  Yesterday when I was
in Xtree Gold I put a disk in drive B, logged it and it contained 15
files, of which all were Aurora.  The disk showed up as having 1.4MB
free - the files that were supposedly on there weren't on there.  I
couldn't delete them in XtreeGold because when I went to it said
"Error: Disk has been changed".  I use TBAV 6.10 which showed a
negative virus scan or a checksum change.  I went into the aurora
directory, deleted the files and everything is O.K.  Typing this up
makes me wondering - I had that directory APPENDed with "APPEND
C:\UTIL\AURORA;".  Would this have been the problem?

Subject: The SETI virus (CVP)

OPNFUT7.RVW  940125

                          The SETI Virus

A question was posed on the RISKS-FORUM Digest regarding antiviral
protection applied to data obtained from the Search for Extra
Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI) program.  On the face of it, this is
absurd.  If there are intelligent aliens out there who have the
technology to contact us, they are unlikely to have Macs or MS-DOS.
Yet, as with the Desert Storm viral myth, and related rumours about
viral programs interfering with missiles, there are some slender
threads of fact involved--just enough to make the rumour resistant
to elimination.

The original poster mentioned the "fact" that all computers are
based on Turing machines and that all Turing machines are able to
emulate each other.  This statement is then used to propose that an
advanced alien intelligence would be able to devise a program which
would be able to infect all computers, and, by extension, a program
which would be able to crash all of earth's computers.  There are
several problems with this concept.

The first is the extreme misunderstanding of a Turing machine.
While a Turing machine can be described in physical terms, and while
a limited Turing machine can be built, the Turing machine is
properly a mathematical concept.  It can be used to determine
whether a program can be written to solve a certain class of problem
and, if such a program can be written, whether the program will ever
give you a useful answer.  The determinations of a Turing machine
are independent of specifics of hardware, architecture or physical
limits.  It is only in this way that the Turing machine is said to
be a universal computer.  Real, physical, existing computers can run
models of Turing machines, but do not otherwise emulate Turing
machines.  Turing machines do not emulate other computers:  you
cannot run Windows on a Turing machine, although a Turing machine
might be able to tell you if you could ever write a utility that
might keep Windows from crashing so often.

Although data from the SETI project is massaged in computers, it is
still just that--data.  In discussing the ability of viral programs
to travel through vectors that are normally assumed to be data, it
is emphasized again and again that computers don't distinguish
between programs and data:  a program is data that a computer has
been told to execute.  In the case of SETI, however, the distinction
is abundantly clear.  It makes as much sense to run SETI data as it
does to read the object file from your favourite computer game.

Even given all of the above, there is still the possibility of error
and software malfunction.  The famous Internet Worm took advantage
of a software loophole which allowed the end of a data overrun to be
entered as an executable command.  It is not beyond the bounds of
possibility that an unknown bug in the programs examining SETI data
will somehow allow the computer to start to try to execute a random
part of that data as code.  That "random" is important, though.  Who
knows what a random sequence of bytes might do?  Cohen's
calculations put the mean time between totally random occurrences of
viral programs in the order of hundreds of thousands of years.
Given the relatively few computers involved in SETI research, our
Sun will likely die before our computers do.  (Or, to put it another
way, we are at staggeringly greater risk of catching the ultimate
virus from the actions of teenage mutant copyright breakers scanning
in pictures from Playboy, than we are from SETI data.)

Ah, you say, but that is only if this is all random.  What if the
aliens are deliberately programming viral programs and trojans into
the data stream?  Well, assuming for the moment that there *are*
aliens, and assuming that they, for some completely inexplicable
reason, want to shut down our computers, trying to imbed trojans in
the data stream would be a particularly stupid way to go about it.
Like supposed NSA types trying to include a mythical virus in a
purported pc's printer going to some random country in, say, the
Middle East, the aliens would have to know more about our computers
than we do.  Our computer architectures are not the only ones
possible.  Even at the most basic level of digital electronics, who
is to say that alien computers use binary logic?  It could be
trinary (or N-ary).  And even if some superintelligent race
somewhere had written a virus that could infect CP/M, UNIX, VMS,
MacOS, MVS and MS-DOS, have you any idea of what the code would look
like after umpteen million years between galaxies?

It'd be easier to go around in a flying saucer handing out packages
that you said were upgrades to "Mortal Kombat III".  In both disk
sizes.

This is also, in a sense, the ultimate answer to the question of the
military use of viral programs.  If you have enough information
about enemy computers and procedures to have half a chance of
designing a good virus, you have enough information to do more
direct sabotage in other ways.

			CALL FOR PAPERS

			ARTIFICIAL LIFE

   Premiering in March with double Fall/Winter 1993 issue

		Edited by Christopher G. Langton
   Los Alamos National Laboratory and Santa Fe Institute

Artificial Life, a new quarterly from The MIT Press, is the first
unifying forum for the dissemination of scientific and engineering
research in the field of artificial life. It reports on synthetic
biological work being carried out in any media, from the familiar
"wetware" of organic chemistry, through the inorganic "hardware" of
mobile robots, all the way to the virtual "software" residing inside
computers. Covering topics from the origin of life, through self-
reproduction, evolution, growth and development, and animal
behavior, to the dynamics of whole ecosystems, its articles present
novel approaches to the theory and application of biological
phenomena.

Artificial Life  will be an essential resource for scientists, academics,
and students researching artificial life, biology, evolution, robotics,
artificial intelligence, neural networks, genetic algorithms, ecosystem
dynamics, and the origin of life.
