so what?
a few 'civilized' societies considered slavery 'acceptable' just a few
generations ago!
To judge something on the basis of acceptance by 'civilized' societies
is a poor excuse to deem something as right or wrong.

Why would i need a lawyer for this?
You and Mr. Bontchev have released more source codes to the wrong

Well, those leaks are real and are more than just 'minor' in quantity.

Not a lawyer but am just about sure that this is not true, certain things
cannot be "disclaimered". I believe this has something to do with things
like "expectation", "implied warranty", and "due care", at least in this
country. Further civil actions need a *lot* less proof than criminal.

Any real laywers care to comment ?

I believe the use of the word 'cannot' in the context of viruses is as
appropriate as 'never' in the rest of our daily lives. And what, if I might
ask, is your point? That because some viruses don't escape, we shouldn't say
that some (most?) of them do?

I enjoy a good game of word play. But I never suffer from the the
misconception that it is any way important. When you go to a boxing match, do
you say to the loser that he fought well, and was unfortunate to have his
face modified by his opponent?

Any viral attack, even by a 'good' virus, causes damage. Read Stoll's book
for a fairly lucid description of the loss of trust in your computer, or in
the network, caused by 'hacking' in general, and the Internet worm in
particular. When things act weird, people get worried. In my opinion this is
justified. Computers should act in a deterministic way, and anyone who causes
spurious behaviour in another person's computer is guilty of some sort of
crime. I'm well aware that commercial software often exhibits such behaviour;
that is only an argument for pillorying commercial software houses, not
supporting the existence of viruses.

The existence of guns in the world, except where used (depending on your
vegan/vegetarian/omnivore stance) for hunting, cannot be supported by me. The
manufacturers of weapons such as Magnums, Desert Storms, etc are entirely
guilty in my eyes. Unless one worships at the temple of profit, can one
support the sale of guns? Maybe an American will have something to say about
that, since their Constitution enshrines the right to hold a firearm. Though
this isn't my main point.

Without the virus writer, a virus would not exist.

Without a (currently known) means of transmission, the virus cannot escape.

Is the vector of the virus, or the virus writer him(her)self more dangerous?

Without the virus, the vector is not dangerous (in relation to this
particular issue).

Without the vector, the virus is still, potentially, dangerous.

And a question to the 'No Liability' lobby - if you have a viral attack, and
you know who the author of the virus code is, who do you blame? Or maybe you
don't apportion blame?

Terribly post-modern, but not very useful. Writing viruses is the sine qua

Should we lock up drug smugglers, or the barons who control them? Which does
more good? Treat the cause, not the symptom. Like locking up prostitutes, or
clearing out squatters, the problem still exists, you've just changed the
players.

Change the product to Nuclear bombs, say. Is the manufacturer still innocent?
Or make the product soldiers; is the government innocent? Crack, tanks, child
pornography, bugging devices. Just a few products where the manufacturer,
IMHO, is guilty for the results. Maybe not liable, in your legalistic sense
of the word. Just guilty in a very real sense. Forget broad, we're talking
about virus writers. Are they pure as the driven snow, or are they a bunch of
idiots, with a severely warped sense of 'right' and 'wrong'?

Good call my friend. Virus writers - get in touch with your lawyers, and
let's see if we can knock up a good disclaimer. I'd like to see the wording
on that.

'Any use of this soldier for killing members of alien races is not the
responsibility of this army. We disclaim everything we can.'

Sorry Mrs German, you're son was killed, but noone's responsible.

What a load of cack. Good for malefactor's consciences, but meaningless to
any sane member of the human race.

See above. A noisy fan in my car may not be destructive in any quantitative
sense, but it sure annoys me. Maybe most viruses are just 'noise'; IMHO we
shouldn't have to put up with it, and we should strive to punish those who
cause it. It's antisocial, maybe not pathological, but certainly antisocial.

> If they cause damage accidentally, is besides the point, as there is plenty

ermm, not quite. We install commercial software of our own volition, looking
carefully at the licence agreement, guarantees, reputation, independent
reviews etc. Viruses tend to get dumped on us from above (or below).

The benefits of DOS (ie it lets you use the box on your desk for something
more exciting than watching it display 'Please insert boot disk') outweigh
the problems (such as CHKDSK, such as supporting a modern day empire with all
the social graces of Genghis Khan's horde from the east). The benefits of
'harmless' viruses is nil. The problems don't have to be too great to swing
the balance against them.

So lambast software suppliers. Don't laud the lowest stratum of the computing
world. And don't make excuses for them.

I've gone on (and I mean that most sincerely) at great length. Please forgive
me - it won't happen again.

Hi everyone,
    I hope someone out there can help me. My computer (386SX running
DOS 3.3) is apparently infected with the Stoned virus (TBAV, McAffee)
or a new variant of Stoned (F-prot). None of these programs detect any
infected files on the hard disk. Does the fact that all three identify
the infection indicate that it is not a false positive? Assuming this
is a real infection, how do I go about disinfecting my machine? Any
advice will be greatly appreciated, either by e-mail or reply to the
net.

  > Here at LBS [= London Business School] over the last 2 weeks, we have been
eradicating a relatively new virus called (Jack_The_)Ripper. The virus got
through our defences. Apparently it is confined mostly to the UK at present.
It is also known to the virus newsgroups. As far as we know, it lives in the
boot sector of floppies and hard disk partition tables, and infects four DOS
files :- FORMAT.COM, SYS.COM, MORE.COM, UNFORMAT.COM . We think it tries to
appear innocuous until the sixteenth reboot, when it will reformat your hard
drive. At the moment, we are only aware of these anti-virus packages which
will detect and/or disinfect effectively: F-PROT, Dr Solomon's Anti-V Toolkit
Our procedure at present for detection/prevention is something like.
  1. Run F-Prot in full screen mode and clean master boot sector.
  2. Run Cleanpar from Dr Solomon Toolkit to repair partition.
  3. Make sure autoexec.bat loads Guard and Findviru.
  4. Use Dr Solomon's CLEANBOO to clean floppies.
  NB CPAV does not detect Ripper at present.

There is NO SUCH THING as the Perry virus.   The Perry program is a program
that is used to add code to other programs to make them ask for a password
when run, or to stop operating after a fixed date.

Any scanner which identifies the Perry program, or programs that have been
modified in this way as virus-infected is just plain WRONG!

Subject: List of viruses for NetWare 3.11? (PC)

My network is having mysterious problems, and I suspect that there may be
a virus involved. (There was a virus that SCAN and F-Prot both recognized
as STONED, but it displayed none of the listed characteristics of STONED.)

Neither F-Prot nor the Intel LAN virus scanner detected any virii on the
network, but I have had some...odd file corruption. The boot images for
my boot-ROM'd PCs have all truncated "login <station_name>" to "i", and,
just over the weekend, directories have started losing letters off their
names (f'rinstance, "F-PROT" has become "ROT" and "NEW" has become "EW").

I'm also checking out the possibility that there've been hardware errors,
but, so far, nothing has failed the diagnostics...

BTW--the network is NetWare 3.11 (50 user) 8/9/91

If anyone has any ideas, let me know. Thanks!

Somehow the programmer should get a hand (in form of a fist) for
this piece of code.

Since I had some real shitty troubles with my machine in the last time,
I would be very glad if somebody could send me informations about the
behaviour of Quox, so I can find out which of my problems can be related
to this virus.

What I found out so far:

Symptoms:
At the C:\> promt type DIR A:
The floppy drive sounds as if there is a misalignment or so.
It scratches about 3 to 4 times on the floppy before it shows
the dir.
If your floppy (I only tried 1.44s) is NOT writeprotected, Quox
will modify the boot sector during this scratching.
Floppies that are modified by Quox can be read from an infected
system, but will _NOT_ be recognized by a clean system by the
above procedure (DIR A:), but will be recognized on an infected
system.
But take care: despite the last sentence, you can _BOOT_ this disk on
the system that was clean till now !!!
Lucky guy, you have one more infected system.

Removing Quox:
Boot on the infected system with a clean writeprotected disk which
contains FDISK and use the undocumented switch FDISK /MBR.
I did it on a system DOS 6.0 this way. It should also work with DOS 5.0,
but I did not try it.

Subject: Trouble ???? something's inconsistant here.... (PC)

OK, I'm looking for some help here...

Here's what I'm running on ms-dos 3.30 (on an 8086 - yes I know through it
out, but...thats not an option).

I seem to have an inconsistancey with my machine...

When I run CHKDSK, I get information say that I have

3 hidden files, taking up 57544 bytes....

Now here's what are the only things that I can find that are hidden (which
I should find hidden anyways, ofcourse).

IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS

and totaling in size 52485 bytes.....

This looks VERY suspicious to me, since I KNOW there are no other hidden
files around...

Does anyone have any suggestions...the virus checker I do have doesn't
seem to be able to find anything, but I don't think it checks the
directory lists, and if its in there.......(and hidden..).

Well, since the Satanbug is a stealth type of virus, it can hide its
presence from virus checkers if it can get into memory before the checker.
You MUST be sure that you boot from a clean, write protected, floppy boot
disk before running the virus checker. Do NOT boot from the hard drive or
the virus can get into memory.

Of course you must have had the insight to create a write protected boot
disk with your av software on it.

Also, after looking at the source code for the satanbug virus, I see that
it has routines for circumnventing the innoulcation routines of programs
like CPAV and SCAN. It is also a polymorphic virus, so you will need a
virus checker that can handle generic viruses. I recommend ThunderByte.

The mouse problem sounds like a shorted cable.

I would have to say probably not a virus, until you mention that thing

Sounds like DIR-2 virus. but you said you've checked with F-Prot so can't be.
Maybe a new virus or maybe you use Doble-Space from MS-DOS 6.00 (It happend to

I strongly recommend you not to scan from a dos-box or .PIF file command,
because a stealth virus could be hiding from booting. You haven't got a
virus free Windows boot disk, so I suggest you to do the following:

Make a secure virus free floppy (format a: /s should do it from an uninfected
system) and copy F-Prot to it. Make the disk write protected and use this,
instead of starting from windows. If you don't, you have a big chance that
you will infect your harddisk all over...

The problem is that if you want to make a virus as secure as possible, you
have to make many, many checks, and it will be about 20Kb. If you apply this
to every executable program, you will waste much harddisk space. A nice
example of a "useful" virus is Cruncher2, but it's not as secure as a
stacker-like program has got to be, but all run-time compressors can't be
thrusted, anyway...

BEGPAN8.CVP  931104

                     2.1  Assume You're Wrong

These days, almost every computer problem has people yelling,
"Virus!"  In fact, while viral programs are a constant and growing
risk, computers have the most marvelous array of bugs, glitches,
failures and just plain bizarre happenings.  There is every chance
that you *don't* have a virus.

So, it is probably time to start looking at the possibility.  Go to
various people and describe the problem.  What may be a completely
new quirk to you may be old hat to someone else.  Some (very few)
examples from a (very long) list of possibilities:

- - a power surge or spike can make the monitor flash and/or go blank.
Depending upon how the computer fails, various noises may result.
This is very common in buildings with older electrical wiring and
elevators, or other large electric motors.  Computers vary greatly
in their tolerance for this.  One may fry, while the next in line
doesn't notice.

- - BIOS machines (usually those running MS-DOS), can sometimes not
"notice" the fact that a Shift, Control or Alt key has been
released.  This may seem to make the keyboard, and computer, act in
a very strange manner.  Susceptibility to this varies by computer,
keyboard and program.

- - we frequently receive queries about the "blem wit" virus, which
appears in memory on computers running on a Novell LAN.  The Novell
driver has text reading, "problem with" in the location that DOS
expects to find an identifying name.

- - floppy disks can go bad. Suddenly, and without warning.  For
various reasons.  You need not have done anything wrong.  There are
also factors such as the infamous "critical error handler bug,"
which means that very innocent actions on your part can be damaging.
Funny, they've never fixed that.

These examples are by no means meant as a troubleshooting guide.
They are merely to show that some very odd things can happen around
computers.  Unfortunately, a book of telephone directory size would
likely be insufficient to cover all the bases.  Still, try to find
out what you can.

Swap out keyboards and monitors to check hardware.  Note any changes
or upgrades recently to the system or programs.  Check other
machines that have the same history.  If you can call in someone to
check, it's probably a good idea.  If you are pretty sure that it is
*not* a normal bug or hardware failure, then go on.
