A virus could be good (at least in theory). How about a virus to unfrag
your drive once a month when you've left the computer for an hour? How
about a virus to protect against all other viruses -- i.e. a vaxine!
These things are possible and with care taken so they don't trash hard
drives etc, I would be a neat concept...
Don't be so close-minded!

Most of the largest antivirus producers are understandably unwilling
to give away ANY virus.  To quote one, "It wouldn't look good if [name
of company] got the reputation as a virus spreader."  However, if you
are polite, can take "NO" for an answer, and if people have seen your
name appear on comp.virus before, you should have few problems getting
a decent set together.

One advantage of arranging a collection for AV testing is that the
most common viruses are (almost by definition) easier to find, so your
test suite can include more of these.  I feel that a test biased
towards detection and disinfection of the more common viruses is
useful for general-purpose testing.  In any case I urge you to compare
your results with Vesselin's just to see if they are close.

If you can't get a collection anywhere else, there are always the
virus BBS's, but this always leaves me feeling dirty all over...

See... out here where _I_ work it's a different story. <grin> My job
takes me into various businesses and homes, where I sometimes find a
viri or two, but I find that if I CALMLY explain that the majority of
computer viri do nothing more than replicate... and display funny
messages.  Then run the thing to prove it. Then reinfect the machine
to DOUBLE prove it.

I guess what I'm getting at is that people need to understand what
they're dealing with and stop thinking of viri as a "witch" of the
90's.  Sure they can destroy your data... or make it so you can't get
to it, but then so can a fire.  If there were a little less "alarmist"
action and a little more thinking going on there wouldn't be as much
data LOST to begin with.  I have a collection of about 1500 viri...
never wrote one, just a hobby...  and have NEVER lost a piece of data
I didn't want to.

Here again... one of the BEST routines for detecting viri was
"developed" by someone using nothing more than the basic tools that
come with DOS and a file compression routine... PKZIP to be exact.
This amazingly simple method of compressing several known clean files
like COMMAND.COM into an archive, doing a daily routine of compressing
the SAME files into another archive and comparing the two with DOS
File Compare... automatically at boot up... detects viri better than
MOST signature scanners.  And the whole thing other than the ZIP util
is free.

I really think we need to reasses our Michangelo media blitz mentality.

If you designed and released such a virus, would you be prepared
to offer a guarantee of - say - $10,000 per incident, that your
program would never corrupt anyones hard disk?

FORM can infect your pc if you *attempt* to boot from the infected
floppy, even if the boot fails (due to the floppy not having system
files or whatever) It is, however, fairly benign - it causes no
_overt_ damage, other than infecting floppy bootsectors and hard disk
partition tables.  On high density disks (as with many bootsector
viruses) it can cause directory tree damage, as it relocates the
original bootsector to a root directory sector.

I would think any good anti-virus program would repair the Monkeys

Are you sure KILLMONK suggested running FDISK /MBR??  The
correct advice is -never- to run that command on a Monkey
infected machine, since Monkey writes an invalid partition
table, and if you use FDISK /MBR to fix the MBR code, it
won't be able to boot (since it won't see the partition
table that the virus stashed away on track 0).  If you've
already done this to a machine, you options are pretty much:

  - Use FDISK to repartition the disk, and reformat etc as
    needed.  Simple and reliable, but you almost certainly
    lose all the files that used to be on it!

  - Use a disk-fixer (Norton Disk Doctor is one, I think)
    that will walk the disk, find the partitions, and rebuild
    the partition table.  Has some non-zero chance of working,
    but may not.

  - Get a guru with a sector editor to look through track 0
    on the hard disk for a sector that looks like a master
    boot record XOR'd with a constant.  Perform the XOR to
    recover the original, write it to the real MBR, and the
    disk should be fixed.

  - Find a system with -exactly- the same size, format, and
    partition-setup as yours, save a copy of that MBR,
    carry it over to your system, write it to the MBR.

There are some issues to consider....

   Just maintaining a virus collection properly is not an easy-part-time job.
   Classifying the viruses properly, replicating the samples and weeding out
   the non-viruses takes a lot of time.

   Obtaining viruses:  Well, most anti-virus companies are pretty hestiant
   to send viruses to anybody...as an absolute minimum you would have to
   demonstrate a clear need, sufficient physical security and trustworthiness
   of the persons having access to the virus collection.  There are also
   other issues to consider - will you give viruses to anybody, and if so, to
   whom ?  What will you be doing that is not already being done elsewhere ?

Except for a very few viruses that are designed to run this way
(and CANSU is not one), running a file that a boot virus has
(accidentally) overlaid shouldn't cause the virus to become active,
or infect the hard disk.  (The environment that a file runs in is
so different from the one a boot sector runs in that it'd be
quite a coincidence, I think, if boot sector code were to happen
to function correctly as a program file.)

> Is disinfecting a boot infector from a file more prone to failure

When a boot infector accidentally overlays part of a file with
itself (or with a saved original BR), the overlaid data is
generally lost, unrecoverable, not saved anywhere.  A backup or
another copy of the program is probably your only hope.

> Can someone send me a rundown of V-sign, so I can panic to the proper degree?

It's a fairly typical boot infector; infects A: and B: and the
first two hard disks.  Sometimes displays a V-shaped sign on boot.
No destructive payload.

Well, the first crazy thing that came to mind actually stands a good
chance of working. Find a machine that is still infected but hasn't
been FDISK /MBR'd yet. Use a disc utility (either Nortons' Utilities,
or possibly Padgget Petersons' MBR saver) to read the *infected* MBR
from this machine. Then, go to one of the botched machines and write
this MBR over the DOS variety, and see if it'll boot. If it does, you
now have a bootable infected system. Use KILLMONK or whatever is the
proper method at hand, and clean up the system properly. Now reboot
it again to make sure it's all working. Then, and *only* then, clean
up each of the remaining machines in the same manner.

Note: Do *not* reinfect one of the non-bootable machines! Infect one
that is clean and working to get your MONKEY-ized MBR, otherwise, you'll
overwrite the information you need to retrieve.

As always, should you decide to accept this mission, boot the systems
from a known-clean write-protected floppy, and write the infected MBR
to another one.

And demo F-Prot to them--they need to license a real product and do
things right in the future.

I have not heard of this particular false positive, but quite frankly I am
not too surprised ... MSAV and CPAV have a rather bad reputation for not
co-existing with other anti-virus programs.  They have been fixing some
of the problems - encrypting search strings in memory and such...

Anyhow, if this is indeed a new false alarm, Central Point should fix it

"FIST 2" is a non-standard name, so it is very difficult to determine which
virus they are talking about.  My guess is that this is some variant of the
second group of the Screaming_Fist family, as no other viruses contain "Fist"
and "2" as a part of the name.  In that case, this could be any of the
following viruses:

    Screaming_Fist.II.650
    Screaming_Fist.II.652
    Screaming_Fist.II.692
    Screaming_Fist.II.696
    Screaming_Fist.II.724

Well, whether DOS anti-virus finds anything or not is really not significant.
However, all those variants are found by SCAN and F-PROT, so if you tried
either of those and they found nothing, I might suspect a false alarm.

No.  It does not exist.

Regarding names of viruses: Well, if you combine several lists - the
VIRLIST.LIS in F-PROT 2.11 (which lists 3356 different viruses), the
latest VSUM (probably around 2500 viruses), and VIRLIST.TXT in SCAN
111 (2738 viruses) you would theoretically end up with the majority of
the 4000 or so viruses that are known today.  I say "theoretically"
because it is extremely difficult to determine which names are aliases
and which ones are not.

As for the list of search patterns - that is impossible, as many
viruses simply do not contain any constant code you can extract a
search pattern from.  There are lists of search patterns available,
but combining them all would probably not be sufficient to detect more
than 50-60% of the viruses that exist.

That reason is simply that with nearly 10 new viruses appearing per
day, just maintaining a decent search string database requires
significant work, and many companies are not eager to give that work
away "free" ...

Cascade checks the file type, not the file name extension - it will infect
any file that is executed, not too long, and which does not start with "MZ",
so it could easily infect an .EXE file that was structurally a .COM file.

This probably indicates that somebody had bought this copy before - infected
it - possibly deliberately, and then returned it.  The store just
shrink-wraps the pagage again and sells it to the next vict...eh, buyer.

Cascade does not change the date on any file it infects.  It would be

the diskette.

If that had been the case it would have been on the master copy, and
there would be thousands of copies floating around.  I have not heard
of any other report of this problem, so my conculion is that unless I
get more identical reports, this is just an icolated incident -
assuming that the possibility of a false alarm has been ruled out.

Why do you think a database is infected?  Since a virus must be
executed to have any effect, a virus infection of a data file
is vanishingly rare.  As described above regarding the WordPerfect
data file "code," one must ask how a data file made the transition
to become an executable program.

I might venture to say the the vast majority of damage caused by
viruses results from ill-advised reaction rather than real instances
of infection.  Please read the FAQ, and possibly consult with
someone who has a clearer understanding of the problem before
deleting files, reformatting disks, or taking other drastic action.

On behalf of the Beta Test Review Team, I thank you for your response.
Firstly, let me assure you that the ultimate goal of this test is to
provide our customers with the best computer security product. We know
that to meet this goal, we need to thoroughly test EMD Armor on a
variety of system configurations as well as amass a test user base as
diversified as our customer base. Not knowing what your background is
or your area of expertise, thus not having any insight into your
skepticism, I can only hope through this respnse to help put your mind
at ease.

The great volume of responses we have received from potential beta
testers attest to their knowledge and familiarity with the requirements
necessary to obtain meaningful results, and we certainly appreciate
the time and effort of all respondents.

I assure you that the goal of EMD Enterprises has always been and will
remain one in which our customers' needs come first. We desire to
satisfy those needs and hope to continue providing our customers with
the quality computer products we hope are synonymous with our name.

I second that, Kevin.  We at Trimm have a site license from Frisk,
and are very pleased with both the product and its author.  While
McAfee & Co. are OK, Frisk is simply a whole lot more technically
sophisticated than McAfee, and it shows in the product.

One of the traditional problems with scanners is that a minor hack
of the code (say, by taking Sourcer and adding a NOP early in
the code) renders the new variant invisible to them until the program
is updated.  All except for F-Prot.  I did an experiment some
years ago where I took source for some of the more common viruses,
such as Jeru-B and MtE/Pogue, and started adding NOPs and other
hacks to them, then reassembled, and ran Scan, F-Prot, and a couple
others to see if the new variant was still visible.  As soon as I
changed anything, Scan would fail to find the variant.  However,
I had to totally mutilate the source code before F-Prot failed
to find the virus.  This makes F-Prot superior against new
strains of hacks (which constitute the bulk of the virus problem.)

It appears that the scan strings in McAfee ScanXXX, at least some
of the time, include the address fields of machine instructions,
thus any inserted bytes earlier in the code make the string
comparison fail.  John can correct me if I'm wrong on this point.

The message below is a reply to an e-mail message from a person in Sweden
but mail to 'mozart.omega.studo.mh.se' bounced, so I am posting it here.

The reason is simple - the files generated by Virsim are not infected, so
why on earth should F-PROT report them as viruses ?  The files contain
random fragment of viruses, but F-PROT is a virus detector, not a virus
fragment detector.

Those three files that were detected are actually false positives, and I would
have been much happier if they had not been detected at all.  TBAV named the
viruses simply because it found search patterns belonging to specific viruses
- - but all those identifications are "incorrect" in the sense that the files
are not infected.

Basically, VIRSIM is totally worthless for the purpose of comparing scanners,
and we have been working on reducing the number of VIRSIM-generated files
that F-PROT reports as infected.   If you try an older version of F-PROT
(2.08 or so) you will see that it reports many more as infected....we saw this
as a problem that needed to be fixed.

I have received several calls from panicked people who discovered the
Filler virus in memory, only to discover that they were merely infected
with MSAV.  This whole business with MSAV is starting to wear a bit thin
on my end...  Microsoft really outdid themselves with this one.

Fortunately, the new versions of F-prot (2.10+) warn the user when their
computer may have contracted MSAV, thereby helping to avoid some of these
false positives.

If some scanner is faster than some other scanner, it does not mean,
that the slower scanner is more reliable than the faster one. Because
we are receiving thousands of new viruses per year and because of
polymorphic viruses, most producers have to work all the time to keep
their scanner fast enough. Some producers have devoloped their
scanning mechanism so that it is both fast and reliable. Of course if
fast scanning mechanism reduces product's quality, then fast scanning
is not worth of it.

You should not fear or respect Form, but you should get rid of it.
Form will be released if (bootable or non-bootable) diskette is in
disk drive and computer is booted. After this "accident" all
disks and hard disks attached will be infected.

And I have right here 7 viri SCAN detects and F-Prot doesn't <G>  How
manny viri did you test the two with?  What types?

When you're talkin' SCAN or F-Prot or IM or... each has it's strong points

This means that you are running VSHIELD with the /WINDOWS switch, which
VSHIELD should be run with just once when it is installed to insert the
VSHWIN Windows compatibility module into the WIN.INI file.  VSHWIN is the
program that allows VSHIELD to display messages under Windows.

Change your VSHIELD command line to "VSHIELD {options} /WINDOWS D:\WINDOWS"
and VSHIELD will install VSHWIN.EXE correctly.
