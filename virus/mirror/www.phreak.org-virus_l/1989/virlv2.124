Subject: VIRUS ALERT: nVirB infection at teesside poly, uk
 
The Apple Macintosh networks at Teesside Polytechnic Main Site Library
& Flatts Lane Business School Library have been infected with the
nVirB virus.  Earliest infection date seems to be end of April.
Machines infected include 128/512k, Mac+, Mac SE, Mac II. Effects:
icons disappear from desktop, problems printing. Have used
Disinfectant to scan for nVir resources and to remove nVir resources,
Immunity to insert "fake" nVir=10 resources to prevent further
infection.

Now that I'm back from the islands mon, I have an announcement to make
mon (that's island talk, mon :-).  On June 16, 1989, I'll be leaving
Lehigh University and going to Carnegie Mellon University, where I've
accepted a position in their Software Engineering Institute as
Technical Coordinator on the Computer Emergency Response Team.
 
One way or another, I plan to continue moderating VIRUS-L/comp.virus.
Things might be a bit shakey during the interim, but VIRUS-L will
survive.  So, please bear with me.
 
Regards,

VIRUS-PLEA 1/4
 
Hello, my name is Bill Hadley.  I would like to ask a favor of the readers
of VIRUS-L.  I am doing research (which will hopefully become a book) on
computer viruses and computer security.  I what I would like you to do, is
to write me a letter if you have ever had an experience with a virus or trojan
horse program.  What I would ask that you include in your letter is:
 
                Name of the Virus or Trojan Horse.
                What computer and operating system does
                   this virus/trojan horse exist on.
                What did the virus/trojan horse do.
                How did you deal with it.
                Where did this happen (ie. George Mason
                   University in Fairfax, Virginia...or
                   company name..whatever..).
                What is your name (if you don't mind if I
                   put it in a section of names in the back
                   of my book).
 
If you would please answer these questions and send them directly to
me, WLHADLEY@GMUVAX.GMU.EDU (not VIRUS-L), I would greatly appreciate it.
This will assist me on trying to track what viruses have spread and how.
If you have had problems with more than one of these evil programs, then
answer these questions for each virus/trojan in your letter (even the
Internet Worm which struck last November).  If more than one person writes
me from one node with the same information, that is okay...it will help me
in the verification of virus reports.  Please only answer this message once.
I will try to post it once a month for the next three or four months to try
to catch new readers.  I realize that I will receive alot of mail, I have
already tried to make room for that.  I thank you in advance for your
assistance.  I will post to the list any thing I find of urgent importance
to the readers of VIRUS-L.
 
Again, thank you for your time.
 
Bill Hadley

If your users will really use it and not turn it off, try to convince
them that they should be running Vaccine. If you can, try to set up a
"cleanup station" as recommended by the Disinfectant doc. Other than
that, sounds like you've got it well under control. I only make these
suggestions in case someone shows up with Scores, which Immunity WON'T
block.

Ken:  You advised Andy Wing to use FSP1.52.  Newest version is FSP1.6.
Got some extra goodies in it, some more informative stuff, and the doc
has been updated a tad.

Subject: IBMPC Antivirals
 
Hello, netland.
 
Some time ago, I sent out a request to all of you to send me info
regarding IBMPC anitiviral programs that are available (for our
"extermination" team here at WSU).  I'd like to thank all of you who
have sent me correspondences and files, especially Matt Mathai, Jim
Wright and Yuval Tal.  Jim has taken on the volumnious (SP?) task of
coordinating a cross-network antiviral archive.  He has been a
tremendous help to our efforts.
 
Now that I've amassed a collection of antivirals, I'd like to pose
another question to you folks...that is >What are your opinions on
these products, and which would you recommend using?< These programs
will be distributed (if they are PD or Shareware, that is) to the
university public as well as the staff here.  Here's what I have:
 
ALERT13U ARC      Alert! v1.3
BOMBSQAD ARC      Bombsqad v1.0
CAWARE   ARC      CAware v?.? (for executable C programs)
CHKSUM   ARC      Checksum v?.?
CHKUP32  ARC      Checkup v3.2
CHK4BOMB ARC      Check for Bomb v1.0
CONDOM   ARC      Condom v?.?
DEBRAIN  ARC      Debrain v1.4
DELOUSE1 ARC      Delouse v1.0
DETECT2  ARC      Detect v2.?
DPROT102 ARC      Dprotect v1.02
FILE-CRC ARC      File-CRC v?.?
FSP$152  ARC      Flushot+ v1.52
SENTRY02 ARC      Sentry v2.?
SYSCHK1  ARC      Syscheck v1.0
TRAPDISK ARC      Trapdisk v1.0
UNVIR    ARC      A comprehensive package of extermination/prevention/
                  resident-memory-check programs
VACCINE  ARC      Vaccine
VACCINEA ARC      Vaccinea (is there a difference between this and the above?)
VCHECK   ARC      Vcheck v1.1
 
Of the above, Debrain seems a must for (c)Brain removal.  On first
glance, and what I've made of previous discussions, Flushot+, Sentry,
and Alert! seem to be the frontrunners in CRCs and segment-checking
programs.  These appear to superseed (or even outdate) most of the
other CRC, file-attribute, or file- segment checking programs such as
Condom or Vaccine.  Of the resident disk protection mechanisms,
Trapdisk and Dprotect seem to be the more up-to-date programs.  Let me
have some relatively unbiased evaluations of what these programs can
do and how effective and easy to implement they are, etc.  (I ask for
unbiased because I know the authors of most of these programs
subscribe to this list ;^) I'm interested in hearing any comments
about the Unvir package as well, since I've never heard of or seen it
before.  Please respond directly to my Bitnet address below.
 
One last poser and I'll bow out of this somewhat long posting.  I also
have available a FIX EXEC written in CMS REXX to cure some UUencoded
file transfer problems I've been having when getting files from across
gateways.  It was written in order to re-translate some of the
characters that some mailers translate when the mail go through.  It
picks on about five or six specific hex codes that cause these
problems.  It was written by a data comm fellow over here by the name
of Brian Holmes.  But, before you ask me for it directly...Ken, how
about posting this one at your Lehigh archive sight (or any of the
antivirals I've compiled here for that matter)??  Drop me a reply and
let me know what you think.  [Ed. Send me the EXEC (for now), and I'll
get it posted.  Thanks!]
 
Thank you for your help and patience.
