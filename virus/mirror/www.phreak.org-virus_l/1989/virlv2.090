Subject:  I need assistance (PC)
 
Over the course of the past week, I have had three of my 3.5"
diskettes "blow up". In all cases I have received error messages when
trying either to run .EXE files or trying to do a directory. The first
diskette had a scrambled FAT, and boot sector. The same held true with
the second, however, there was the added discovery that all sectors on
that disk were bad. The third diskette is completely unaccessible,
either by trying to execute files or do directories. I have not, at
this point tried to discover the extent and exact nature of the damage
to this diskette. I am nowhere ready to cry virus, but in all honesty,
I wouldn't know a virus if it kicked me in the shin. At this point I
am unsure as to how to go about eliminating other types of operator
and/or hardware problems. Any help that the readers of this group can
offer would be greatly appreciated. I don't want to run around like a
chicken with my head chopped off, and really need to kow how to go
about eliminating or confirming the more ordinary problems that crop
up. Thanks in advance.

Just as a note for Virus-L: the current version of FLU_SHOT+ is 1.52.
It is always available for free on my BBS at (212)-889-6438
(2400/1200/ N/8/1/24hr).  I will forward a copy over to SIMTEL-20 on
my next distributor fufillment cycle (middle of week of April-16)

My feelings exactly.  An adage that's been going around the industry
for some time now is "Ignorance is no substitute for security."

I need any information on the punishment, present laws, and pending
laws that deal with implementing computer viruses for an english paper
any information would be greatly appreciated
