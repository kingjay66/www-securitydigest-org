While I agree with pretty much everything -else- Otto writes, I think
these statements are perhaps a bit too strong.  Consider, for instance,
a modification-detection program that works using a nice long CRC
(at least 30 bits), and that uses a "user-selectable" polynomial
(for instance, the program might prompt the user for a long string
when it's first run, and use that to find an irreducible polynomial).
If the program and the database are kept on external media (in a floppy
in a locked desk drawer, for instance), and the polynomial key is
also external (in the user's head, or on that locked floppy), AND
the program is run only after cold-booting the maching from a trusted
IPL floppy (perhaps the same one again), so that the checking program,
key, and database are never in the machine at the same time as a virus,
I think I would claim that knowing all about the checking program,
including having the commented source code, would do the virus-writer
NO GOOD AT ALL in trying to defeat it (as long as the user's secret
key isn't known, of course).  That's just because it's not possible
to make a probably-undetected change to a dataset if you don't know
the polynomial used for detection (and if the CRC uses enough bits).

Objections?
