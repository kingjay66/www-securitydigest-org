Subject: Viruses, Networks, and NFS: Questions
 
Joe Sieczkowski's recent remarks about the possibility of NFS-borne
viruses lead me to the following questions:
 
I understand that EXECUTING an infected program stored on an NFS
server could infect the client system.  I'm wondering if NFS has
loopholes such that a client can be infected by a server WITHOUT the
client requesting execution of a server-based program (for example,
via a worm process, a bogus remote procedure call, or ???)  Anyone who
knows NFS well is hereby invited to speculate.
 
We are a few weeks away from getting our first NFS machines, so I'm
not very familiar with the ins and outs (I don't have documentation
yet, either).  This is not a burning issue, just a question which our
security task force is bound to ask sooner or later.

Subject: AppleShare volumes (Mac)
 
I have a question about virus infections on an AppleShare file server.
 
If I partition the server into two "volumes", and if one of these
volumes becomes infected, will that infection spread to the other
volume?  I'm not talking here about users infecting the other volume,
but about the infection spreading across the server from one volume to
another (users would have access to only one volume).  Since both
volumes share the same operating system, I'm assuming this would be
true, but would appreciate more informed opinions.  Thanks,

Here are more details as a follow-up to the message i forwarded to you
yesterday on this suspected new virus. This person is seeking
assistance to find a way to eradicate the infection and perhaps
disassemble a copy of it too..

Here is some general information about the 'DENZUK' virus.  No
specific information is available as to it's origin, what it actually
does, or how long it takes to do it.
 
The 'DENZUK' virus.
 
    The DENZUK virus first started showing up here at Ball State
University, Muncie, Indiana around the 16th of April.  It was first
noticed because everytime that the computer is re-booted, a graphic
display will show up and the letters DEN ZUK * will slide in from the
sides of the screen. (The * is a graphics symbol resembling the AT+T
logo) then the system will roboot.  The display only lasts for about 3
seconds and will only be seen on a graphics screen (CGA is the only
one that has been checked).  If the disk is not write protected, the
virus (I call it that, but techincally it might be a worm, we really
don't know) will write a counter to the disk.  After about 5 times of
rebooting, the disk will become useless.  The information is still
there, but the disk is un-usable.  (It might overwrite the directory
blocks or something simular).
 
    The 'DENZUK' virus can be transfered to either other bootable
disks or DATA DISKS (unbootable disks).  It was thought for a while
that the virus could possibly be transfered to disks with a write
protect tab in (as it is possible to do that on IBM PC's), but this
can only be done in certain instances.  This instance would be if the
write-protect tab was squeezed or torn a bit.  The virus is transfered
to another disk whenever another disk is accessed (either read or
write) and that disk will then have the virus.
 
    The only way known of checking for that virus is to reboot the
computer with the disk you want to check in the A: drive.  This will
work with system or data disks to check for the virus.  This is not to
say that this is a sure- fire way of checking for DENZUK.  It may well
keep a counter to count up the number of times re-booted and not start
showing the display until a certain number.  That would give it time
to propagate even more.
 
    It has also been found out that the virus writes to the first
track.  This may be where the actual program is, or it could be where
the counters are kept, or both...
 
    At this point, we do not know what, if anything, this virus will
do to a hard drive.
 
    That is all that we know right now, if we learn any more I will
try to keep you informed.

Subject: Hiding Viruses by Intercepting Output
 
        Some time ago, a person brought up the idea of a virus that
would intercept the sector reads.  If the sector that was read was the
one in which the virus lived, then the virus would return bogus data.
Someone else responded with a reason why this would not be an easy
task to do.  Could anyone tell me how this method of hiding a virus
would fail?  Consider the virus using this technique to be a boot
sector virus.
