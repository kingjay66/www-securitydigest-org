     I was wondering if anyone has comments on the way reports of
viruses seem to be given too much attention by the media.  As an
example, when our Mac's were hit by the nVIR virus, a local newspaper,
the Cincinnati Post, place a report of the virus on the front page.
The virus was a relatively minor occurance, start-ups were being
disabled, applications were being altered, but no loss of data.
Surely this is newsworthy, but front page?  This seems comparable to
placing reports on the front page every time the common cold breaks
out on campus.  Comments?

Subject: Re: PC Boot Sector Viruses

      In issue #61, Y.  Radai discusses the "bouncing ball" virus and
 its spread outside of his area to other European countries.

      This made me think about the transmission method of these
beasts.  A straight-forward boot sector virus would only be spread by
the boot sector (physical media) and so wouldn't propogate across
serial lines ("electronic media": modems, BBS, "long distance"
networks) - but might on local nets.

      I would be interested to hear from those unfortunate to be
infected:

      Was the infection via an infected disk?
      Was the "culprit" disk identified?
      Was the disk created by a user?
      Was the disk formatted by a user?
      Was the disk from a software house?
      Was the disk received by post or by person?

      I realize that its naive to assume that you can only get
infected with .EXE viruses via a line or boot sectors with physical
media.  I would have thought that the disadvantage of propagation of
the boot sector types would have favoured the .EXE types.  However,
most of the PC viruses currently causing damage seem to be the boot
sector types.  Anyone in netland like to comment?

That's fine if you only want to check things once in a while; but what
are these other schemes?  And how do you protect your operating
system?  And you're ignoring the context of the remark: keeping
programs in an encrypted state until execution.  Surely you don't
propose to reboot the computer every time a program is executed.  The
difference between keeping programs in an encrypted state and just
computing signatures on them is that the former actually deters the
spread of a virus, while the latter merely allows you to detect it.

I must assume you are referring to the type of system described
(rather lucidly) in the last issue by William Murray, which
relies upon an already existing network of trusted sources.  I
can see this as viable in some ways.  But I'm not clear on how
it would help the average user who has very few "trusted" sources.
Even software houses have distributed viruses inadvertantly of
late.

Public-key cryptography works fine when you have a method of
distributing the decryption key uncorrupted.  But in the case of
a signature list coming from a bulletin board (for example),
using a public-key method just abstracts the problem one more step.
You STILL need a clean channel for transmitting the decryption key;
else anyone can modify a decrypted version of the signature file,
encrypt it again with another public key set and distribute the
new decryption key with the new signature file.  This is a trivial
step for anyone who actually desires to modify the signature file.
Public-key cryptography is just begging the question.  And once
again, if you have this uncorruptable method for transmitting the
decryption key, you may as well transmit something simpler, like
file size, various checksums and crcs, or the entire program.  It
again boils down to whom you can trust.

Subject: File lock protection?  (Mac)

MacUser magazine reported in the Tip Sheet section of their April
issue that locking individual files using the Locked bit of the Finder
info (using the Locked button in the Get Info window, or a file
utility program) will prevent virus infection.  I don't remember
whether they said "prevent" or "help prevent," so please don't correct
me if I missed a word.

My question -- will this really accomplish anything?  Can any known
viruses infect an application file that has its Locked bit set?
