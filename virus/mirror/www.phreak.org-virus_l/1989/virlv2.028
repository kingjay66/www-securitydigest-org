Subject:  re: init 29 virus (Mac)

The 'INIT 29" virus is not a mutation of nVIR, even if it is very
similar. Its sole purpose is to replicate itself. Other than that, it
causes no harm to the system. However, it will copy itself to *every*
resource fork that has been opened by the System, an application or a
utility (CDEV, DA, etc). I'd classify it as extremely virulent.

Symptoms are an INIT resource with ID 29 and a size of 712 bytes.
Infected applications also have an additional CODE resource of the
same size. If you open the application with ResEdit, the viral
resource will be on top of the list of CODE resources.

As it patches the code jump table, removing the INIT and the CODE
resources without restoring the table will cause your application to
crash.

The latest version of VirusDetective (2.0) will detect this virus. It
will not repair an infected application, as it does not restore the
jump table. The next version of AntiPan will probably be able to
detect and remove it.

In any case, I suggest you to trash the infected applications and
system files. Other infected resource files (those who do not contain
CODE resources) may be repaired by removing the INIT 29 resource.

Subject: Mac Virus?

I have a MAC-SE that I *thought* was eradicated from all viruses
(virii pl?).  It seemed free of nVIR and SCORES and all the others and
yet the system crashes periodically and I need to reload it from the
original.

Any advice?

Subject: checksum protection

David M. Chess made a pretty convincing argument in the last issue
that he can absolutely trust his checksum if he keeps the checksummer
on a floppy disk which is locked away and never inserted into a
machine that hasn't just had a warm boot.

I will agree with him that he can trust his checksummer, but unless he
can checksum every file on my hard disk in under one minute its a cure
that's worse than the disease (just add up how long you would spend
doing checksums in a year and compare that against your expected rate
of infection).  Also, suppose I have five hundred files on my disk.
How am I going to know what the checksum for each of them should be?
Keep a list of checksums on my disk?

This shut-the-machine-off, boot-from-floppy, run-checksum, put-floppy-
away and switch-over-to-hard-disk routine sounds like a lot of work to
do every time I want to run my word processor.  Its a whole lot worse
if you want to do it not to an isolated PC but to a networked
workstation.

Also, what does the checksum program tell me?  It tells me that
someone has destroyed my data.  It doesn't tell me when and it doesn't
tell me what to do to get it back.  I still have to keep backups of
everything.

Checksums are good for checking the integrity of data if you have
reason to believe that it has been corrupted (ie did I just download a
bogus copy of VirusRX off the network).  They are not a good way to
handle everyday protection against viruses (consider the couple that
tries to practice birth control by spending ten minutes every morning
giving the woman a pregnancy test).

Add up how much time you personally expect to loose in a year from
data lost to viruses.  Any "cure" that takes up more of your time in a
year than you expect to loose is quite litterally "wasting your time."

Nobody spends $20,000 a year to insure a $10,000 car.  Even fewer
people spend $20,000 a year for a service that merely tells them
whether someone has already stolen their $10,000 car.

Roman,
I happen to live in Reston, and although I've never heard of the
place, chances are that its only about 5 or 10 minutes from my house.
If you could get me an exact address or something I'd be glad to pop
over there someday and try and scare up a copy.
