I see a little education is needed here!   A standard fixed disk
has at least two (2) boot records.   The first is sometimes called the
"master boot record".   You can read it with code like
 
    MOV AX,0201h               ; Read one sector
    MOV BX,0500h               ;  into DS:0500
    MOV CX,0001h               ;  from absolute sector 1
    MOV DX,0080h               ;  on drive C:
    INT 13h                    ;  now, please
 
The master boot record's job is to look through the partition
table for a bootable partition, load the partition boot sector
(see below) from that partition, and pass control to it.  The
master boot sector is put on the disk by FDISK (for instance).
It is *not* written or updated by the SYS command.   If a virus
(like the "Stoned") infects the master boot record, SYS is
*not* going to help any.   (This is vanilla IBM PC-DOS's
SYS command that I'm talking about; there may, of course,
be other systems whose SYS commands do something different.)
The master boot record is very very simple, and doesn't
contain anything about DOS versions (take a look at it yourself
and see!).
 
The other important boot record is the partition boot record.
This is the record that the master boot record reads in and
passes control to.   If the partition is a DOS partition (as
most of them are, hehe!), this is a DOS boot record.   You can
look at it in DEBUG for instance, with commands like
 
   -l 500 2 0 1
   -d 500
   -u 500
 
You'll notice that what's displayed here includes the DOS version
number and so on, and is *different* from what you saw when you
did the BIOS call given above.   This DOS boot record is what
the SYS command overwrites.
 
> We have advised over 300 infected corporations involving over

On a floppy disk, of course, there is only one boot record, and
the SYS command does replace it.   But fixed disks have more than
one boot record (if there are "extended partitions" on the disk,
I think there can actually be *three* types!), and SYS only writes
to one of them.  So SYS should not be counted on to Fix Everything,
even if invoked from a clean system.
 
Sorry if that upsets you, Alan and Tim, and I'd be glad to be
corrected if I'm wrong!   But try the things suggested above,
and see if you come to agree with me.   I tried it myself: made
a change to my master boot record, SYSed the disk from a clean
system, and noticed that the master change was still there.

Couldn't agree with your more!   I've been fighting these
ugly things since early '88 myself (brag, brag), and I know
it's not a joke.  It's only by careful study, and tolerance
of each other's errors and foibles, that we can efficiently
cope with this new challenge.   Hang in there!

Original-Subject: ->NEW VIRUS AND CURE<- for ALL IBM PC/XT/AT/386
Original-Date: 7 May 89 19:13:57 GMT
 
I do not know if this is realy a NEW virus, but this campus is now in
the middle of a large infection.
 
The virus is not destructive UNLESS the disk it is trying to infect is
full (it needs one cluster -- 1024 bytes)
 
HERE IS WHAT IT DOES:
At some time a single character will start bouncing around the screen
but you can still continue to do what ever you want.
 
HERE IS HOW IT SPREADS:
It loads into memory at boot time ONLY! (taking 2K of free memory)
If you boot with a clean disk, you are safe.
If you boot from an infected disk (hard drive or floopy) it will
then stay in memory (until a warm reboot) and transfer its self
to ANY disk (bootable or not) when ANY disk operation are done.
Then if you boot that disk on another computer it will start
transfering its self again.
 
HERE IS HOW TO FIND IT:
On your disk it marks its self as a bad cluster. BUT you can read it.
(it picks the FIRST free empty sector, or picks a used one if your
disk is full) In memory it takes up 2K (check your memory from a clean
disk then the questionable disk) To find the sector in you disk do
search of ALL sectors for FF 06 F3 7D 8B 1E F3 7D using something like
Norton's NU If you find that and it is maked as BAD in the FAT then
YOU HAVE IT.
 
HOW TO KILL IT:
You can do FILE by FILE back up then reformat the bad disk
then restore the files (the virus is NOT part of a file
it's part of the boot system)
 
The long way (But it works well...and for hard drives) Make a floopy
with the same version of the operating system you have on the bad disk
make sure that SYS and NU and NDD are on the good disk BOOT the good
disk...go into NDD do a "MAKE DISK BOOTABLE" from common fixes (to the
bad disk) then do a SYS to the bad disk....YOU ARE DONE...the virus
will no longer load....you should the go in to NU and unmark the fake
BAD cluster (2 sectors) and zero the sectors
 
REMEMBER: IT WILL INFECT ALL DISKS
even if they are not bootable....
the virus can still infect a cleaned disk...
flu-shot may detect it, but by the time you run it
the BUG is already in memory and running....
 
If you find a better way to KILL it then please POST!!
(and send me mail...)

        One of my friends who is not on the virus-l list has sent me
the following message from Southbank polytechnic.  The message to all
our UK subscribers is to watch-out for these programs which show
pornographic pictures, and which students copy from each other... thus
helping the virus contained within the program to propagate and infect
new hard disks.

Agreed!  One of the first viruses in the Mac community (known
variously as "Peace", "the MacMag virus", or "Brandow's Folly") was
intended to be benign.  Reportedly, the programmer worked for quite
some time to ensure that the virus would have only one effect
(displaying a message of world peace on a specified date), would
delete itself cleanly thereafter, and would have no unfortunate side
effects.
 
Didn't quite work out that way.  The virus was (apparently) tested on
machines in the Mac Plus family (monochrome, 68000-based), and didn't
take into account the differing architecture of the Mac II
(68020-based, multi-bit-deep screen, different memory layout).  There
were reports of Mac II systems crashing, and/or corrupting their hard
disks, when this virus kicked in.
 
A virus that's benign in one host can be deadly in another... this is
certainly true for biological viruses, and seems to be true for
computer viruses as well.

Subject: More on SecureINIT... (Mac)
 
Another tidbit about this application.  One of the users on the
Twilight Clone BBS (not Joe McMahon) here in DC recently tried this on
his system at home.  He alledges (and I believe it) that SecureINIT
deleted some hold-dozen inits, including OnCue.  It looks more and
more like this one's a dog.
