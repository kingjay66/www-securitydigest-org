    Hello,
Besides nVir and Scores, what other viruses are `out' for the Mac.  I
am interested in their frequency of appearence and how they can be
identified and dealt with.
 
                Muchos Gracias,

     David Loveless and other Virus-L users have asked about virus
identification software for PC viruses.  The people at HomeBase have
put together a program called VIRUSCAN that is able to find and
identify the 53 viruses classified by Jim Goodwin in May of this year.
The program Scans entire systems or individual diskettes and runs
pretty fast (1 minute for each 200 executable files).  It's shareware
and available on the HomeBase BBS - 408 988 4004.  Disinfectors for
each virus are also available.

Hm.   The "Brain" virus that I've seen changes the boot sectors
of floppy disks, not COMMAND.COM.   Are you sure about that?

You're probably right.  The oldest versions of the System do not scan
the System folder for INIT (Startup), RDEV (Chooser), and cdev (Control
Panel) files;  INIT resources contained in these files will not be
executed.  GateKeeper and Vaccine are both cdev files.
 
You _might_ be able to install a hacked-up copy of Vaccine into the
System file on your startup disk(s).  You'd need to configure Vaccine
on a more-modern machine... probably "protection on, expert display,
don't compile MPW INITs, don't show icon at startup".  Then, use
ResEdit to copy the INIT and FKDT resources from the configured copy of
Vaccine, and paste them into the System file on your startup floppy.
You could also try configuring the copy of Vaccine to display its icon
at startup time;  you'd then need to copy the ICN# resource from the
Vaccine file and add it to the System.
 
I haven't tried this and can't assure you that it would work... but it's
probably worth a try.  Do it on _copies_ of Vaccine and of your startup
floppy, of course!  Best of luck!

Subject: Anyone heard of this new virus ?? (PC?  No system given)
 
Yesterday and today articles about a new virus appeared in an Israeli
paper (Maariv).  It seems that the virus (some sort of a TSR maybe ?)
is planting typos (i.e typing mistakes) when printing to the printer.
It does not affect the screen or the data on disk itself.  It was even
claimed that it is a mutant of the "bouncing ball" virus.  Anyone
heard of such virus. Has anyone been hit by that beast - or is it just
the cucamber season again ??

Subject:      Virus attacking WP 5.0 (PC)
 
         We have a problem here with Wordperfect 5.0 and I am not
         sure if it is a virus infection. It does look quite
         suspicious, however.
 
         The problem is that when WP 5.0 is loaded and users try to
         retrieve a file that was created by the same program, an
         error message appears stating that there is not enough
         storage. This is despite the fact that there is 5 Megs of
         space left. This does not happen with every file, but the
         ones that this happens to, are trashed beyond repair.
 
         Although, the size of the WP.EXE has not changed, the
         checksum is radically different from the copy of WP.EXE on
         the master disk.
 
         Has anyone encountered anything like this before?
         Do you think this could be virus?

Subject: Re: virus distributed on Compuserve (Mac)
 
Regarding my recent query as to whether a Mac virus may have been
distributed via Compuserve at some time, I quote Dr. Fred Cohen ("On
the Implications of Computer Viruses and Methods of Defense",
Computers and Security, Vol. 7, No. 2, Pg. 169): "On the very widely
used Compuserve network, a virus was apparently planted to infect the
initialization files of the Apple MacIntosh.  This virus was designed
to put an advertisement on the screen on a particular date and then
delete itself.  It was noticed by a programmer browsing through his
system initialization files and was traced to a company that had added
a program to the Compuserve library.  The perpetrator was barred from
Compuserve 'forever'.  Compuserve has countered by providing a public
domain program that constantly runs in the background checking for
modifications to system initialization files and asks the user if
these are desired."
 
Thanks for all who added their input.
