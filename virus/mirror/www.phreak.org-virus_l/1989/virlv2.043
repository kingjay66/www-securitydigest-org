Dear Moderator:
   I am very new to your VIRUS-L mailing list, and still somewhat
unfamiliar with viruses in general. Recently, however, I have noticed
some peculiar behavior with my Toshiba 1200 Laptop computer. It seems
to throw random "h"s on the screen from time to time. At first, fairly
infrequently, and then increasingly more so. At this point it throws
"h"s, backspaces, spaces so often it's as if it has a mind of its own.
At present I am having the keyboard diagnosed at the dealer, but its
behavior did not give me the feeling that it was actually a keyboard
problem. Does any of this sound remotely familiar?
   Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

Subject:      Valentine's Day VTxxx trojan horse mail message

The following was posted on our local bulletin board, so we're
definitely getting into third- and fourth-hand information here.
This is really just a Trojan Horse rather than a virus, but I
thought I'd pass it along.

- ------------------------
Folks,
        What I am about to relate was triggered by a second-hand rumor,
but it reflects a very valid security concern and is something that we
may wish to deal with immediately.

        The rumor is that a Valentine's Day message has been prepared
that has the potential for causing lots of personal (and operational)
havoc.  Any user who reads this message, on a VAX system, using a
standard DEC terminal, will have all of his files deleted.  This little
nastygram is rumored to also put a sweet message and heart on the
screen while doing its dirty work.  A nice touch.

        At the risk of being alarmist, I suggest that we immediately
inform our users to be suspicious of any messages of unknown origin.
Information is limited and we do not know if it will appear or how to
recognize it if it does.  If I get more information I'll send it
along.
- -------------------------

I have a few questions for anyone who knows VTxxx terminals:

1)  Is it possible to do this on a VT1xx or VT2xx terminal?  I know it
        is possible to cause the answerback message to be echoed, but
        I don't know of a command to load the answerback message from
        the host; it is possible to load a definition into a (shifted)
        function key, but that requires the user to press the key;
        I know of no command to echo the contents of the screen back
        to the host as input.

2)  If it is possible, is there a setup option that will immunize the
        terminal from this particular disease?

This sort of attack has been known for years, especially on
forms-oriented terminals, but I had believed that my terminal (a
VT220) was not subject to this particular vulnerability.

Has anyone else heard about this?  Has anyone actually SEEN this
beast?  If you notice it ahead of time, it should be simple to
determine what it does and where it came from (unless it's
self-perpetuating like the XMAS EXEC -- but there's no easy list of
destinations on VAX/VMS).

P.S.  The lack of a way for this thing to hide its origins from anyone
        who is looking for it makes me wonder if it is real.  But I'll
        be looking over my incoming mail extra carefully for a few weeks
        anyway.  -- Gary

I'm very afraid it isn't a hoax. I spent a good part of the afternoon
trying to reach Thierry Delettre and the DTS of Apple France. I
reached both of them. Below are some precisions. For those who want
general info, check the posting made a few days ago.

- - The virus adds 1344 bytes to the CODE ID=1 resource of an application
- - it has been purposely written to attack applications from Apple Inc.,
  and does this by checking if CODE ID=1 is named "Main". Other applications
  won't be infected. non-application files won't be touched by the virus.
- - the code segment starts with the following byte sequence: 6000 0028
  (this is BRA *+42 for those of you without sixteen fingers) and
  contains the four letters 'ANTI' (I think right after this first
  instruction, but I'm not sure - the line noise was terrible). Note that
  the CODE ID=1 resource also contains a 4-byte segment header, so check
  for the sequence in bytes 5-8.
- - It loves MultiFinder. Seems to propagate faster through MultiFinder than
  through a standard Finder environment.
- - Vaccine detects it only if the "Always Compile MPW INITs" is unchecked
  (could someone explain me why?)

I should get a copy of the bugger by the end of next week, if the french
postal service doesn't go on strike again. Expect a report soon.

Thanks to all of you who responded to my question about (c) Brain.
Your help is greatly appreciated.

Now I have another question about an unidentified virus (?).  This one
turned up in a department on campus when they were checking their disks
for (c) Brain.  The symptoms are as follows:

1) A strangely altered boot track (on 360K floppies) that Nortons says
is "not a boot track".  The machine appears to boot normally, though.
There are no messages that are obvious.  One of our Systems people is
currently disassembling it to find out what it does, but we do know that
it sets aside about 10K of RAM for itself before loading DOS.

2) Alterations to the FORMAT.COM file, if it exists on the contaminated
disk.  The only obvious change is the prompt that asks the user to
press ENTER to begin formatting.  Now it says "Press <-' to begin".
In other words, it tries to draw out the ENTER/RETURN symbol.

Are we just getting paranoid, or does this sound familiar to anybody?
None of the disks in this department showed any signs of (c) Brain
infection.

Thanks again for your comments.

Subject:      Information Requested

We are starting a Computer Post here, and one of the topics of
discussion will be viruses/trojans.  Does anyone have any suggestions?
The average age of the students involved is 14-17 (8th grade - 12th
grade).  Due to this, a "detailed" technical representation is not
necessary (and I probably wouldn't get it right, anyway..(grin)).

Please respond directly to me.

                       Thanks in advance,

                           James

P.S.  If someone has already done this to a similar age group, I would
      like to here from them.

Subject:    Apple 2 Elk virus

Re: Bruce Howells request for information on the elk cloner virus for
    the Apple 2, I enclose a copy of an article from USENET posted by
    <PGOETZ@LOYVAX.BITNET> on April 26 1988, giving further details. Hope
    this is of some use.


Here are descriptions of a virus and a nasty program header which run
on the Apple II family.

===============
                        The Elk Cloner V2.0

   I found the Elk Cloner V2.0 #005 on a disk of mine in 1981 or 82.
I'm fairly certain it could not have been written before the
publication of Beneath Apple DOS, so I would date it around
mid-1981...  It works exclusively with DOS 3.3.

THE VIRUS

1.  It is installed by booting an infected disk.  I'm not sure how it
initially gains control; apparently it is loaded in with some trash
from T0 SA which DOS loads for no apparent reason.  (BTW, since
HackerDOS rearranges DOS on the disk, the Cloner would trash it.  It
might trash master disks, I don't know.)  If you use a modified DOS
which marks T2 S3-8 as free for use (as HackerDOS does), it would
overwrite any file stored there.
   A JMP $9B00 which was installed when the disk was infected jumps to
this code (I think) and loads the virus from T2 S3-S8 into $9000-95FF.

2.  Next, it inserts its claws into DOS:
   A. Hooks into the Do Command code at $A180 and makes every command
reset the DOS parse state to 0.  I have no idea why it does this.  It
has no obvious effects.
   B. Hooks into the RUN, LOAD, BLOAD, and CATALOG commands to make
them check the disk accessed & infect it if necessary.
   C. Create a USR vector for the Cloner diagnostics:

B=USR(10)       Prints a cute poem:

ELK CLONER:
   THE PROGRAM WITH A PERSONALITY

IT WILL GET ON ALL YOUR DISKS
IT WILL INFILTRATE YOUR CHIPS
YES IT'S CLONER!

IT WILL STICK TO YOU LIKE GLUE
IT WILL MODIFY RAM TOO
SEND IN THE CLONER!

B=USR(11)       Prints ELK CLONER V2.0 #005 (version check)

B=USR(12)       Read the disk & prints BOOT COUNT: (#)

B=USR(13)       Infects a disk

3. Increments the boot count

4. Checks for any special event for this boot:

Boot # (hex)    Effect

A       Point reset vector to $FF69 (monitor)
F       INVERSE
14      Click the speaker
19      FLASH
1E      Switch letters at $B3A7-B3AA so filetypes T I A B will appear as
        I T B A
23      Change DOS signal character from ctrl-D to ctrl-E
28      Lockout the computer on reset (dangerous one!)
2D      Run the current program on any keypress (locks out the machine, also
          dangerous. BTW, this is done by setting the hibit of $00D6.)
32      Print above poem on reset
37, 3C, 46      Screw with the INIT code.  I think it will give you an I/O
          ERROR, but I haven't tried.  3C and 46 might be dangerous in that
          it might not init a whole disk.  I don't know.
41      'Crash' to monitor on every DOS command
4B      Reboot
4C      Reboot
4D      Reboot
4E      Reboot
4F      Write 0 to the boot count & start all over again!

5. Sits back & infects disks.

This is how the program is structured:
9000            Version number
9001-9073       Setup
9074-908F       [Check a disk for infection] code
9090-90D9       Replacement code for LOAD, BLOAD, & CATALOG
90DA-9178       [Infect] code
9179            Read VTOC
9181            Write VTOC
91A8            Print routine
91E4            Serial #
91E5            Marked with a 0/1 if a disk is infected/uninfected
91EC-9243       Diagnostics
9244-9328       Poem
9343-9435       Special events by boot count
9500-9532       Code which loads Cloner on boot
95E1-95FF       ASCII: MATT BE<ctrl-D>JOHN HINKLYJOHN HINKLE<ctrl-D>
                (The author's hero?)

These are within the VTOC:
B3BE    Zeroed, I don't know why
B3BF    Boot count
B3C0    Zeroed, don't know why
B3C2    Infection mark: Version number (=(9000))
   There may be several versions out.  The version number would be used so
later versions would write over older versions, for a new improved
infection.

THE TEST

Any of these methods will work:

1. Check T$11 S0 Byte 7. If it is non-zero, the disk might be infected.
2. Check T1 S0 B$80-82. If they are 4C 00 9B, you have the Cloner.
3. Check T2 S3 - T2 S8 for the Cloner.
4. From Applesoft, immediately after boot, enter B=USR(11).

THE VACCINE

   If you write a 2 to T$11 S0 Byte 7, Cloner version 2 will not
infect that disk. I have verified this.

THE CURE
   Write something (like 00:1 AD 88 C0 4C 59 FF) to sector 0 so you
can't boot that disk.

PRECAUTIONS
   The Cloner will not work unless you boot an infected disk.  It
cannot infect a write-protected disk.  I have infected disks I use all
the time.  Just mark them as infected & don't boot them.
