VIRUS-L Digest   Thursday, 10 Aug 1989    Volume 2 : Issue 172
 
VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU.  Information on
accessing anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: Unix archive site
 
It looks like we have an archive site for Unix anti-virus software
(wuarchive.wustl.edu (IP#=128.252.135.4)).  Now all we need is some
software for the archive.  It would seem logical to start by putting
all of the documents on the Internet Worm there (which is already
done), but I'd also like to see some software tools.  For example, a
tool for automating checksums (and/or CRCs) on specified, or all,
binary files would be a good starting point.
 
The files on wuarchive.wustl.edu are in "~ftp/usenet/comp.virus".  The
current document files there are in the "doc" directory (of the above
directory) and any programs, as they're made available, will be in the
"src" directory.
 
Contributions of both software and documentation are encouraged, as
are ideas, suggestions, comments, etc.
 
And thanks to Chris Myers for supplying the archive directory!
 
Thanks,
 
Ken

Subject: DataCrime II - tiny clarification (PC)
 
Alan Roberts is basically right about the oddness of the "DataCrime II"s
self-degarbling code.   One small point (just so we don't get too
impressed with these virus-writers): while the trick that Alan refers
to does prevent the virus from degarbling itself if you single-step
through it, it's still trivial to disassemble; just set a breakpoint
right after the degarbling loop (there's even one clear byte there
to make it easy!), and let it run until then.  The virus writer
was probably trying to show off, and no doubt thinks him/her/itself
very clever, but in fact the trick added about 90 seconds to the
time required to analyze the virus, and was hardly worth the effort...

Subject: Virus in Gould logic analyzer distribution (MAC)
 
Yesterday, one of the people here discovered that the Mac II's we
are using as part of a Gould logic analyzer setup came from Gould
infected with nVIR.  The disk is marked as
 
    CLAS 4000 Software
    Version A12
 
Gould knows of this problem, and I assume they are taking appropriate
steps.

     Are there any virus archives for the Macintosh besides
MACSERVE@PUCC AND LISTSERV@RICE?

Apparently I missed the posting of the Mac archive sites.  Sorry folks.
I'm trying to automate things a bit, and must have lost it in the confusion.

From:    carroll1!dnewton@uunet.UU.NET (Dave Newton)
Subject: LaserWriter (Mac)
 
Is there such a thing as a LaserWriter virus on an AppleTalk net?  We
printed out a directory listing from a MacII hooked to a net and on
two of the pages got these large black lock-like looking things in the
middle of the page.  The funny thing is, they were different sizes,
one was big, one was small.
 
I didn't read about those in any Apple book 8-)
