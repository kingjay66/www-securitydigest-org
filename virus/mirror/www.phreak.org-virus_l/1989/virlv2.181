VIRUS-L Digest   Monday, 28 Aug 1989    Volume 2 : Issue 181
 
VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

     In reply to Dan Carr's question. No, when you lock a macintosh disk and st
ick in the drive, there is absolutley no way for the virus to infect the disk.

Subject: vaccine source (PC)
 
I would like to offer our bulletin board system once again to the
readers of Virus-L as a source of VIRUSCAN and other
"vaccine/scanner" programs that are occasionally mentioned here.
I attempt to keep up with the most recent versions I can locate
of the various programs, and usually also have the current
version of the Dirty Dozen trojan horse/list.
 
The Wellspring RBBS is located in the Biomedical Library of the
University of California, Irvine (U.S.A).  Numbers and settings
are as follows:
 
    Line # 1 -  (714) 856-7996 300-9600  (HST) N81 - 24 hours
    Line # 2 -  (714) 856-5087 300-1200 baud N81   - Evenings & Weekends
 
Callers from Virus-L should use the following passwords to allow
immediate access to downloading of files:
 
    First name     Last name     Password
    ----------     ---------     --------
    VL1            BITNET        BIT1
 
    VL2            BITNET        BIT2
 
All files are located in the VIR files directory.  The system
uses standard RBBS commands.
 
I attempt to get my files from the original source whenever possible.

How does one go about "capturing" virus code on an infected disk or at
least view the offending code?  Would one use ResEdit?  Any other
comments are most welcome.  Thanks much.

The story is apocryphal.  Roots are as follows:
 
1. Anything a computer can be programmed to do, a virus can do.  Thus,
if a computer can be programmed for behavior that will damage the
hardware, then it can be destroyed by a virus.
 
2. Early IBM PC Monochrome Adapter had a flaw under which a certain set
of instructions could interfere with the normal sweep circuit operation,
causing camage to the monitor.
 
3. Based upon this combination of facts, there has been speculation
about the possibility of a virus exploiting this, or similar, flaws.
Much of it has been in this list.
 
To my knowledge, no such virus has ever been detected.  The number of
such PCs is vanishingly small but larger than the ones that such a virus
might find.  Those that exist are so old that a monitor failure would be
attributed to old age.  A virus would likely go unnoticed.
 
Of course, it is a little silly to build a computer such that it can be
programmed to perform hardware damaging behavior.  Such damage is likely
to occur by error.  That is how the flaw in the IBM's was discovered.

No.  If the write-protect mechanism is working properly, any software operation
will be unable to change the contents of the disk.  If the write-protect
mechanism is somehow faulty, all bets are off.  Note:  The write-protect
mechanism on Mac disks is done in hardware.

Subject: Monitor destroying virus (PC)
 
Regarding the request for information on a virus that destroyed monitors:
 
I have had confirmed that there is a command for certain types of monitor
adapter cards for the IBM/ISA/MS-DOS world which will turn off the "scanning"
of the display.  This means that a line or point may "burn in" on the monitor
and destroy the phosphors at that point.  When used "properly" it may also
cause the CRT itself to overheat and burn out.
 
The cards susceptible to this are all older CGA type.  As far as I am aware,
this code has never been incorporated into a virus.  It would not do ttoo mcuh
damage in any case, as it is very machine specific.

Subject: Monitor destruction
 
I seem to recall that the the olp IBM PCs ( and clones )
with EGA cards were susceptable to this problem.  The cuase
was the ability to change the scan rate of a card ( and
thus the monitor ).  If the scan rate was too high the
flyback transformer in the monitor would over heat and catch
on fire.  I don't remember viruses doing this damage but rather
public domain games and the like.

Subject: List of Viruses/Antidotes/Vaccines for PC/AT/386
 
Hi, I am compiling a list which consists of the following items:
 
1) Viruses, date first discovered, source(s).
 
2) Antidotes/Vaccines for the above viruses, latest version, when were they
   made available. Are they Public Domaine (PD), Shareware (Share) or
   Commercial (Cmc) products, Author(s).
 
I wonder if such a list has already existed? if so could someone send me a
copy preferrable via E-Mail. I will post my findings on the net to all
interested parties in about two weeks time. Thank you all in advance for
your help.

Subject: Re: Swap Virus (PC)
 
I don't think that it is so important how we call the virus. I've decided
to call it the swap virus becuase the message "The Swapping-Virus...' appears
in it! We can also call him the Israeli Boot Sector or The Dropping Letter
virus - it is not important! as long as people know by its name what it should
look like! Meaning: Ping-Pong --> there is a ping pong on the screen so I
think that calling it "The Dropping Letter Virus" will be just fine.
 
I think that the name "Israeli boot sector" is not such a good name. Think
about the simple users who do not care it this virus was written in Israel
or in any other place. They also doesn't care if it a boot sector virus or
anything else! Again, I think that the name should describe what the virus
is doing!

Subject: V-REMOVE (PC)
 
    The HomeBase group is releasing a new disinfector program that is
able to remove all known viruses, repair all infected COM files, repair most
infected EXE files, replace infected partition tables and boot sectors, and
generally make life easier for people with infected IBM PCs.  Our previous
practice of releasing one disinfector program per virus has given us a
terrific maintenance headache, and so V-REMOVE (which does them all) is our
next step on the path.  What we need now are beta testers with Large virus
libraries.  Interested parties please contact John McAfee or Colin Haynes at
408 727 4559.

Subject: Looking for info in PC viruses
 
I'm about to release a nice package fighting Macintosh viruses in
real-time.  I would like to add to my cdev virus eradicator the
ability to clean PC files as most Mac now have FDHD drives. Where may
I find the methods to remove viruses of PC files ?
 
Yours,

If the diskette is hardware locked (ie: the little slide is slid so
that you can see a hole) then the hardware won't write onto that
disk, so if you stick it into an infected machine it won't get
infected.  If, on the other hand, files on an unlocked disk are
locked in _software_, they may be fair game to a persnickety virus.
