The version that I tested on yesterday was 0.3v29 instead of 0.3v27.
I apologize.  29 identifies Ping Pong correctly while 27 doesn't.
I will submit follow-up report if more discrepancy found between 27
and 29.

We have a virus on our PC, it is not a new one I think, but what to do?
The virus infects all disks,5 1/4 and 3 1/2 and the harddisk.
We can find the infected disks by using chkdsk. chkdsk gives 1024 bytes
bad sectors on a infected disk. When we use that disk in another
computer then we also have 1024 bytes badsectors on that harddisk.
When we use format on an infected computer, there seems to be nothing
wrong, formatting goes well, but when we use chkdsk it gives 1024 bytes
bad sectors.
So far I know that format, copy, diskcopy can't be used anymore and
xcopy doesn't work anymore.
I now  low level format the harddisk and put the original files on it
and we format all the floppydisks with badsectors.
But when someone uses a disk with bad-sectors we have the virus back again.
We also can see the virus when we using backup or pcbackup etc. then
there is a little ball bounching over the screen. I also happens
sometimes ! when we using copy, diskcopy or an other copy command.
I don't know the program that infected our system, but we have a
lot of work to deal with it.
 
Is there a easier way to deal with the virus, except low-level format.

Eeeek! What on earth could cause it to be that expensive? Is each
edition the size of a telephone book, or something?

Found this on a BBS.......
 
                         James
 
P.S.  Anyone know of a FORTRAN to C conversion program?  Please respond
      to me and *NOT* to this list.   Thx

WARNING!  WARNING!  WARNING!  WARNING!  WARNING!  WARNING!  WARNING!
- --------------------------------------------------------------------
 
There is a file being circulated on many BBS's called PKZ100B.ZIP
or similar, and contains PKZIP/PKUNZIP 1.0 Beta.
 
This is not an official release of version 1.0 from PKWARE.
The Beta software is not, and never was, intended for general
distribution.  When the programs are run they will display:
 
 
PKZIP (tm)   FAST!   Create/Update Utility   Version 1.0B   06-30-89
Copyright 1989 PKWARE Inc.   All Rights Reserved.   DO NOT DISTRIBUTE!
 
PKUNZIP (tm)    FAST!    Extract Utility    Version 1.0B    06-30-89
Copyright 1989 PKWARE Inc.  All Rights Reserved.  DO NOT DISTRIBUTE!
 
 
clearly indicating that they are not for general distribution.
 
* Moreover, the files being circulated have been altered from the
* genuine Beta programs.  While the nature of the alterations has
* not been determined yet, I would be extremely leery of running

e files.
 
If you see these files on any BBS or on-line system, please ask
the SysOp of that system to remove the files IMMEDIATELY.
 
If you have any information leading to the individual(s)
responsible for the alterations and uploading of the altered
files, please report it to PKWARE immediately, either:
 
by Voice at 414-352-3670
by BBS   at 414-352-7176
by FAX   at 414-352-3815

- -----------------------------------------------------------
On a personal note, this intentional and willful act by the
individual(s) that are responsible, people who asked to be
Beta testers for the software and thereby asked PKWARE to
trust them, is very disappointing.  The Beta documentation
explicitly asked that the software NOT be uploaded to any BBS
or on-line system.
 
These actions will only hurt and confuse the user community,
and do not help anyone.  Unfortunately, it also means that
future releases of PKWARE programs will take longer due to
additional security measures that will have to be taken with
Beta software, in order to protect the user community against
these types of vandalism, and prevent them from happening again.

One of the managers here just plunked one of these "rumor" columns in front of
me.  According to this one, there exists a Mac virus that infects Microsoft
applications, that interferes with non-Microsoft applications.
 
Just to be on the safe side, does anyone know of concrete proof that such a
virus (yes, I know the description above is a rather broad one) exists?
