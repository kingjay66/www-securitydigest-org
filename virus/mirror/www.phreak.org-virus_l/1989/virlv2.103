Is Apple working on a mechanism to write protect hard drives via
hardware?  If so what's the time-table?  Any other comments on the
subject would be most welcome.

I will be out of town until Thursday, so please don't send me messages
saying, "What happened to VIRUS-L".  We will resume the digests on
Thursday.  In the meantime, please feel free to continue to
contribute.  I'll digestify all of the incoming messages upon my
return.
 
On a side note, news readers may be interested to know that comp.virus
should be operational shortly after my return.  Those readers who get
Usenet news at their sites will probably want to opt for reading
VIRUS-L via the comp.virus newsgroup.
