VIRUS-L Digest   Thursday, 14 Dec 1989    Volume 2 : Issue 260

VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,

This is to announce a new version of Virus Encyclopedia.  I have updated
the stack to include the WDEF Virus and all those variants of nVIR that
have appeared since its last release.  Which release you have can be
determined by the date modified listed on the Disclaimer card.  This
latest release is dated 12/12/89.

I have just finished uploading VE to CompuServe, GEnie, several Chicago
BBSs, and HomeBase BBS in California.  I have also made arrangements
with John Norstad to get a copy to the info-mac archives and
comp.binaries.mac.  If you are unable to get the stack in any other way
(and please try!), I will accept requests accompanied by a disk or
$2.50 at:

Subject: File authentication software (PC)

Recently I had the chance to discuss the inner workings of VALIDATE.EXE,
(no..not VALIDATE.COM), with the authors. This program has been around
for almost two years now, and has just under gone a dramatic change.

In the past, it has detected changes in a file by reading the entire
file, and using two proprietary formulas, calculated two CRC's for
each file tested. VALIDATE.EXE is fast and capable of processing
over 64,000 characters a second.

The new version takes an entirely different approach. While I cannot
go into intimate detail, basically it reads in large blocks of the
file, takes a "snapshot" and continues. The block size varies depending
on file size and available memory. If EMS or Extended memory is detected
the program will increase the size of the blocks being read, up to the
optimal size of a 1 megabyte block.

Each "snapshot" taken is then processed. The contents of "snaphots"
vary, depending on the type of file being processed (com, exe, ascii),
the size of the file, and several other factors, including the total
number of snapshots taken.

As processing continues, two authentication strings are built. These
are then encrypted, and converted to hex format for display.

There are two versions of this program. The DOS version is capable of
reading and processing over 113,000 characters a second.The OS/2
version of validate was designed to run under PM and takes full
advantage of the advanced OS/2 functions. It has the ability to run
several threads at the same time and does so whenever possible. The
raw processing speed of the OS/2 version is not as fast as the DOS
version, but the use of threads speeds the entire program up. Just
thought you might like to know about this program. It will be available
in both versions through SIMTEL in the near future.

I have been asked to pass the following message along verbatim:

  Re: Free disk offer

     After processing and filling requests for over 570 EAGLSCAN (tm)
disks, we are now withdrawing our offer. Each and every request has
been filled, and all disks are on the back via US mail.

     SWE did not expect any where near the response we received and
it has been a major project to produce these disks for you. So be it,
we made the offer, and we learned our lesson.

     Any disks received after December 13, will not be processed until
we open again, after the holidays. We will fill any requests starting
January 4, when we return from holiday.

     Thank you for your requests and have a happy holiday.

I think this is based on a misunderstanding of the damage that
the DIR EXEC does.   It never looks at the dates on *files*;
it looks at the current date (via QUERY TIME), and if the last
two digits of the year are greater than 89, it will erase all
files with mode a0 or a1, regardless of the dates on the files.
Changing dates on files will have no effect on how DIR behaves.

Subject: RE: AIDS Trojan (PC)

The AIDS Trojan Horse discussed by Alan Jay and John McAfee raises some
interesting questions about accountability.

Ignoring the issue that it is unlikely that the U.S. Government is
unlikely to get cooperation from the Panamanian authorities in
apprehending the culprits and bringing them to trial in either
country, could the perpetrators be held liable under U.S. law for
damages, when the licensing notice clearly states the program is not
licensed to be used in the United States, and that damage will result
if you attempt to do so.

In the broader case, could the perpetrators be extradicted to one of
the European countries that have better relations with Panama, and be
held liable for damages even though the license says not to use the
application without first paying for it.

One consequence of this attack (although I find it unlikely legal
authorities will be able to take advantage of it because of the
situation in Panama) is that the perpetrators should be relatively
easy to track.  Someone rented the Post Office box in Panama.
Hopefully someone is picking up the mail from that box, and from there
it goes to the people behind it, somehow.

Subject: Becoming a Virus Expert (Mac)

Earlier in the year (mid to late October) someone inquired on some
suggestions for becoming a "virus expert".  (I assume in hopes to
become an anti-virus expert.)  Joe MacMahon suggested a number of
things one of which included reading about ROM patches, INITs, and VBL
tasks in Inside Macintosh.  I made an attempt to locate these topics
in Inside Macintosh and came up with the table below.  (I was unable
to find any information in the index on ROM Patches.)  I have not read
the topics I have listed, but intend make reading them a priority.
Are what I have listed below relevant to the person who wants to
maximize the amount of information attained while minimizing material
to be studied?  Are there other references that would be better?
(Inside Macintosh references and "outside" references.)  Other
thoughts and comments are most welcome.  I hope this helps some and
hope that others will help this list get "fine-tuned".  If you find
anything grossly wrong with the list please do not bug flame Joe,
flame me.  Thanks.

                        AIDS INFORMATION DISK
                        =====================


The latest on this is as follows:

If you have run this disk contact ROBERT WALCZY at PC Business World
on 01-831 9252 they have a FREE disk that combats the effects of the
disk and they will send a copy to users effected.

Either call Robert of FAX him on 01-405 2347 with your name and address.

The disk should be available in the next day or two.

The program will be available on CONNECT (01-863 6646) for download as
soon as it has been tested.


=======================================================================


The AIDS disk when installed creates a number of hidden files and
directories.  You can remove these files by running the program
mentioned above or by using the Norton Utilities, PC Tools or equivalent
program.

The files that are hidden include a new AUTOEXEC.BAT and a number of
other files and directories that contain characters that can not be
accessed by standard DOS commands.  You will need to rename the files/
directories before they can be deleted.


This information will be updated as we learn more about the disk.

I have encountered the virus 1813 here at my school.  Does anyone out
there know anything about this virus.  This was detected using the
Virscan program by IBM.  I think this virus may be related to the
"Friday the 13th" virus.  Any comment out there.  Please post in the
news group since some people may be interested.  Thanks

                                =====================

Update 2  13-Dec-1989 6pm

IF you have not run this disk DO NOT INSTALL it appears to be a very
cleverly written TROJAN program that can be activated by a number of
methods.  Currently the activation method that has been detected uses
a counter of the number of system reboots.  When the counter gets to
90 the system goes into a second phase and encrypts files and
directories on your hard disk.

The program appears to have a number of embelisments that makes one
think that the front door we have been shown MAY not be the only
method that the system uses for deciding when to activate.  This
is a very nasty program and the only 100% safe thing to do is to
backup all DATA files and perform a full reformat of your hard disk.

Followed by a reinstallation of all DATA, from your backup, and
programs from original system disks (or backup prior to installing
this software).

This should only be attempeted once at least TWO copies of all
valuable data have been extracted from the system.  Please remember to
boot your system off an original DOS disk before starting this
procedure.

Full details of the suggested procedure will be posted tomorrow.

Alan Jay

Readers who do not wish to follow this route may be interested to
in the folowing information about the primary activation system.

1)  A hidden 'ACTOEXEC.BAT' file contains

CD \<ALT255>
REM<ALT255>

        it then runs your AUTOEXEC.BAT which the program renamed AUTO.BAT

2) A hidden subdirectory <ALT255> contains a file REM<ALT255>.EXE

Each time the system is booted the program is run and the counter
incremented/decremented.  After 90 activations the system enters phase
TWO.

Please note that the system uses the <ALT255> character 'hi space' in the
file names to stop standard DOS procedures acting on these files.


IT MAY be possible to delete these entries and thereby disable the
program this is NOT certain and it will take several months to discover
if this is a safe course of events to take.

I hope that this information helps.  I also understand that this is in the
hands of the Fraud Squad / Computer Crime Division of the Metropolitan
Police.  If you have any further information I am sure that they would
be interested to here from you.

Subject: AIDS Trojan Update (PC)

This is a forward from John McAfee:

     A lot more has been discovered about the AIDS Information
Trojan in the past 24 hours.  First, the diskette does not
contain a virus.  The install program does initiate a counter,
and based on a seemingly random number of re-boots, the trojan
will activate and destroy all data on the hard disk.  The
diskette was mailed to at least 7,000 corporations, based on
information obtained from CW communications - one of the magazine
mailing label houses used by the perpetrators.  The perpetrator's
initial investment in disks, printing and mailing is well in
excess of $158,000 according to a Chase Manhattan Bank estimate
that was quoted in a PC Business World press release from
London.  The bogus company that sent the diskettes had rented
office space in Bond Street in London under the name of Ketema
and Associates.  The perpetrators told the magazine label
companies that they contacted that they were preparing an
advertising mailer for a commercial software package from
Nigeria.  All offices had been vacated at the time of the
mailing, and all addresses in the software and documentation are
bogus.
     The Trojan creates several hidden subdirectories -- made up
of space and ASCII 255's  -- in the root of drive C.  The install
program is copied into one of these and named REM.EXE.  The
user's original AUTOEXEC.BAT file is copied to a file called
AUTO.BAT.  The first line of this file reads -- "REM Use this
file in place of AUTOEXEC.BAT for convenience".  The installation
also creates a hidden AUTOEXEC.BAT file that contains the
commands:

          C:
          CD \
          REM  Use this file in place of AUTOEXEC.BAT
          AUTO

     The CD \ actually contains ASCII characters 255, which
causes the directory to change to one of the hidden directories
containing the REM.EXE file.  The REM file is then executed and
decrements a counter at each reboot.   After a random number of
reboots, the hard disk is wiped clean.  Definitely a new
approach.
     So far the mailings appear to be limited to western Europe.
No reports have been received from the U.S.  If anyone does have
the diskette, or has already run the install program, a
disinfector has been written by Jim Bates and is available on
HomeBase for free download.  408 988 4004.  The name of the
disinfector is AIDSOUT.COM.

Subject: WDEF found at SUNY-Binghamton (Mac)

        We have identified the WDEF virus here in our public complexes
here at SUNY-Binghmton.  Thanks to Disinfectant 1.4, we are already
asking all users to come to our consulting office and have their disks
checked.

        The earliest date of infection that we have noticed in our
work tonight is December 11, 1989; indicating that it spread extremely
rapidly here, possibly due to a pair of infected printing stations
that we found.

        Over the last eight hours, the number of infected disks found
has been dropping rapidly, indicating that we caught it before it got
too far.

        Many, many thanks to comp.virus for the alerts, and to John
Norstad for his quick work with Disinfectant!
