VIRUS-L Digest   Monday,  4 Dec 1989    Volume 2 : Issue 252

VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: Jerusalem-B in demo progs. (PC)

We have recently located the Jerusalem-B virus on a bunch of VGA demo
programs including Rolex, Raisins, Fuse etc.  I don't suppose these
were the original carriers but it might be worth double checking VGA
demo programs that get passed around.

Fortunately we caught the programs before any harm was done.  They did
infect our SCANV program however.

MANY MANY thanks to the creators of SCANV40.  I'll be in touch with
McAffee Associates but for future reference - which source has the
most recent version of this program?

Subject: Jerusalem B virus infection (PC)

     On Tuesday, Nov. 28, we had an infection of the Jerusalem B virus
here in at least two campus DOS student clusters (56+ machines).  As a
result of regular backups being made of the server in at least one of
the clusters, a verified uninfected restoral was successfully made and
all cluster disks were again checked for infection.  It would appear
that the majority of the damage has been repaired, but it is likely
that there are some infected floppies floating around now. Users are
being advised of this and appropriate software has been installed to
help prevent a reoccurrance of the infection.  More specific
information can be obtained by sending e-mail to me directly.

[Ed. In addition to this story, Mr. Seborg submitted a detailed
description of the Brain virus and his University's encounter with it.
Due to the article's length, I'm sending it out to the
VIRUS-L/comp.virus documentation archive sites rather than including
it here in a digest.  Thanks for the articles Brian.]

    Now is the winter of my discontent.  It has been cold all day, and
a looming specter of destruction dampened my spirits.  Would it strike
again?  No one knew whether we were safe in our sheltered system, or
whether we would be wrenched from our tranquility into the
gut-wrenching realization that we had to fight, had to protect
ourselves against the menace that had destroyed so many others who
were caught unprepared.

I looked intently at my screen making sure to note every nuance of my
environment.  The flicker of a drive light sent me into a protective
mode of questioning, "should that have happened?", "was that
legitimate?", "has that happened before?"  The whirring of drives
spinning quietly in place made my body tense, expecting the worst,
hoping that it wouldn't happen, at least not today, not now.  I hadn't
had a chance to back-up many of the bytes which could be forever lost
if today happened to be the day.  God, how I hated those vermin who
had let loose these horrors that destroyed at random the hopes and
thoughts of the innocent.  But they had not gotten to me. No, for I
was not innocent.  Though I had jumped into the breach, I had been
ready.  I am ready.

Though I despise them, I am also indebted to them.  Not for the
destruction they have caused, but for the skill I have been forced to
master in order to fight them. Not because they were skilled, but
because I am more so.  They will not wound me easily, and I will not
be easily dispatched.  I have been victorious in countless battles
which are now but ghosts in my memory.  Only once have I been close to
defeat, but, in the end I prevailed.  My mind saved me when my
defenses had failed.  Not so the Taiwanese.  He had not been so lucky.
He had appeared with his work maimed and crippled.  Most of it beyond
recognition.  But he was brave, and we fought together.  Fought until
we had rooted out and killed the disease which had caused his loss.

Or so we had thought.  One had survived, and lived on in our systems.
Somehow it had gotten through our defenses, though we thought them
impenetrable.  But it was not as smart as I.  Not quite.  I found it.
Found it minutes before it would have destroyed my system leaving my
disk to thrash in agony as my dreams and thoughts evaporated in front
of my eyes.  But it was not to be.  Not on this particular day.  It
reared its ugly head, and I chopped it off at the neck.  I have
preserved its offspring in captivity so that I may learn from them.
But they no longer hold any power over me.

Still, I must watch.  Watch and wait for the next time, for there will
be a next time.  So I stare at my screen spellbound, and listen
intently to the whirring of the drives, their flickering lights
pulsing in the half-light of my office.  I am ready.  To the vermin
and their creations I mentally extend the challenge: Go for it!

There   is a   file    going  around called    either  NORTSTOP.ZIP or
NORTSHOT.ZIP which, by  it's (sparse) documentation and  the  copyrigh
inside the EXE file, claims  to be from  Norton Computing.  Because of
the  sparse and unprofessionally presented docs,   I looked within the
EXE file and found:

The Norton Public Domain Virus Utility, PD Edition 5.50, (C)1989 Peter
Norton

     Your System has been infected  with a Christmas virus!   Selected
files were just  eliminated!  Without  these files, you might as  well
use your computer as a  damn, boat anchor!  If you  do NOT own a boat,
you may  want  to replace the files   which were just erased.   Try to
determine which files they were.  HARDY HA!  HA!  HA!  HOW DO YOU FEEL
NOW; YOU IDIOT?  MERRY CHRISTMAS AND HAPPY NEW YEAR!

I spoke  with  Craig and Tony from Norton  Computing and it sure ain't
their's.  I DID  run McAfee's SCANV on it,  and it  came up  empty, so
either SCANV simply  can't recognize it, or  it's a prank,  but either
way, it has no business being in circulation.  Be on the look out!

   From: TONY MCNAMARA
   Subj: Trojan Horse

    We at Peter Norton Computing would like to bring to your attention
an unauthorized trojan horse named NortStop.ZIP or NortShot.ZIP (these
files are the same).  This file was NOT produced with the knowledge or
permission of PNCI.

    This file is not a virus (it does  not infect files).  Instead, it
is  a trojan horse  (it must be run explicitly  to  cause any damage).
When run, it lists the directory and claims the  system is virus-free.
Between December 24th and December 31st, however, it will  erase files
in several directories based on their extensions.

    These   files can be   recognized by their  sizes (NortStop.ZIP is
31744 bytes, NortStop.EXE is 38907 bytes), or  by doing  a text search
for the strings "NORTSHOT.EXE" in the ZIP, "Norton Public" in the EXE.

    If you find or hear of these files,  please contact us immediately
through Tony McNamara, 213/319-2076 (voice), TMCNAMARA 381-9188 (MCI),
or CompuServe (72477,2504).

    Again,   these files are in no   way associated with PNCI.  Please
help us track down and eliminate these files.

    Thank you,
        Peter Norton

Is there a SCANV51 in existance?  The Sunday after Thanksgiving I
called a couple of BBSs in the Boston area and found a file called
SCANV51.ZIP posted on one or two of them.  I looked on Simtel20 and on
vxc.cso.uiuc.edu and could find only SCANV49.

 I have dealt with a strike of Jerusalem's virus on a friend's PC and
succeded in producing a program to wipe out all viruses from the disk.
Since I claim no copyright over the code I will post it in a few days.

Subject: Scanv49/Scanrs49 woes (PC)

I just downloaded and uudecoded Scanv49.arc and Scanrs49.arc from
Simtel. The trouble is that when I try to execute either of them the
pc I'm using hangs! I've used both Dos 3.1 and 3.2 with the same result.
Can some virus guru out there please tell me what I'm doing wrong. I'm
supposed to be looking out for viruses, not to hang the machine! I
know I have a virus stalking around here and somehow attached to all
labelled disks which makes me believe it infected Label.com. Not only
that, I recently bought both Pctools 5.1 and Turbo C 2 & Assembler and
on doing executing simply Dir to check the contents of the diskettes
they all reported one hidden file with size 0 bytes! They couldn't
have left Central Points and Borland already infected! I've just found
out to my discomfort that practically all pc's here are infected.

Please HELP before I send all these stuffs flying through the window!

Thanks in advance.

There's not much to say about it so far.  It is apparently sufficently
different from other nVIR clones so that older versions of
Disinfectant will not catch it (there is allegedly a Disinfectant 1.3
that will catch it though) but not so different that Virus Detective
will not catch it.

Of course, Virus Detective has the advantage that it will allow the
user to add new search strings for new viruses as they are found.

Subject: Viruses and Anti-Semitism...

I could not help but notice that the lastest version of nVIR adds new
resources called "JUDE".  Furthermore, the virus was reported by the
folks over in Switzerland, where German is widely spoken.  Jude is
German for "Jew".  Call me paranoid, but could there be some
connection?

My personal suspicion is that this clone was created by some
anti-semitic group in Germany (which is unfortunately seeing a rise in
anti-semitic acts, as is this country), and that the virus simply made
its way into Switzerland.
