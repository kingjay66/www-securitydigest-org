From my own editorial comment:

> report of a virus until it can be verified.

Oops, saw this just as the digest was leaving my screen for the
LISTSERV...  That was *supposed* to say that we have to take any
report of a virus with a grain of salt until it can be verified.
                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The point being - don't trust a virus report until you've gotten
verification from a reputable source.  E-mail, in general, may not be
a reputable source.  It's important to follow up a virus report via
some other form of media, like a phonecall to the author of the
report.

Apologies for the typo, I got a bit carried away with the editor...

I think that another useful distinction can be made here.  I suggest
that such software, to the extent that it makes the machine on which
it exists different from the population at large, goes a long way to
making that machine immune to viruses.  It is less effective in
protecting it against Trojan Horse attacks which are specifically
aimed at it.

Viruses exploit the similarities among systems.  Its success is
independent of its ability to infect any particular machine.  Indeed
it is naive to anticipate viruses that can account for any and all
arbitrary differences among machines.  To quote a famous hacker "why
would anyone do that?"

One of the problems with viruses is that they can be successful even
in a population in which many of the targets are partially, or even
totally, immune.  (Note that the Internet Worm was extremely
successful, and very disruptive, in a population in which the majority
of the machines were not suited to it.  It was also disruptive to
machines in which it could not execute.  It interfered with their
normal traffic and it sent them attack traffic.  Nonetheless, the
vulnerability to viruses arises, in part, because there exists a large
population of similar machines.  In a world in which no two machines
had any predictable similarity, then, while we might still have Trojan
Horses, we would have no viruses.

An anecdote regarding messages returned when booting non-system
diskettes.

In "Brain and the boot sequence (PC)" (VIRUS-L v2 #5), Dimitri
Vulis writes:

Diskettes formatted using the SideKick Plus 'File Manager'
display the following message if the are booted without being
SYSed:

       Hand crafted by the SideKick Plus File Manager

       Gavaskar, Bradman, Grace, Compton, Richards, Khan,
       Knott, Hadlee, Trueman, Lillee, and Holding.

       Remove the disk from the drive and press any key
       to restart the system.

The text is found in the boot sector, starting at offset 52 (decimal).
The text "SKDOS1.0" appears at offset 4.

I must say that I was a bit surprised when I discovered this by
accident.  (Goes to show that you should read the manual thoroughly
:-))

I stand by what I said. The SYS command does a lot of elaborate
checking to make sure that IBMBIO.COM fits contigiously into the first
data sectors on disk. FORMAT/S just writes the file into the first
data sectors. The boot code has to make certain assumptions---there's
not enough room for the logic to read the FAT and compute the
sector/track for each cluster to simulate a file call.  So, it assumes
that if the disk has IBMBIO.COM and IBMDOS.COM as the first files in
the directory, (and finding that takes room too) and if they are
hidden/system, then the code assumes that the disk is OK and
IBMBIO.COM is indeed in the first data sectors. It computes the
sector/track for these sectors and (ordinarily) reads in the file
using INT 13 (note the wording).  Certainly, one can mess around with
a disk and create one that won't boot, because IBMBIO.SYS is not at
the beginnig. This would require some (a little) conscious effort and
cannot easily be done with just FORMAT/S or SYS. I was describing a
successful boot, in which the file is read into memory.

Regarding the other point (Trojan-protection software):

That's a matter of opinion. FSP 1.4 is the only such program that I'm
familiar with that is marginally acceptable to me. The previous
versions of it did more harm than good. Most other programs of this
type (that intersept INT 13 and report suspicious activity) are
useless. What good is a program that indiscriminately reports _every_
disk access? It is unconscienable(sp?) that some crooks charge money
for such programs and use cheap scare tactics to induce dumb ignorant
people to pay for them. By the way, I don't even use FSP 1.4, and
here's the reason: some time ago (years) I called Ross Greenberg's
BBS, and there was a message from him saying that over 50% of uploads
to his board turn out to be Trojans. I'm not implying that the guy is
unstable, but I'd rather see the source code for a program that
intercepts disk access and can potentially do very nasty things
(remember NOTROJ?).

Also, by the way, last semester I wrote a short (COM file) virus for
my cryptography class that _infected_ FSP 1.4.

What do I mean by discretion? Well, I don't download software from
BBS's anymore (too bad), I back up everything I've done at the end of
the day (have been for many years), and I don't have stuff (executable
and other) online that I don't need. I don't happen to use a
floppy-based machine, but if I did, I'd make sure I reboot from a
write-protected floppy I can trust.

If you look at the ads in US computer magazines, that's exactly what's
said/implied: 1) _everyone_ needs such programs, 2) they offer 100%
protection.  I'm willing to believe that Israeli users are smarter
than American users. In this country even complete idiots (pardon my
French) use PCs---just read some of the recent messages in this very
digest. When you place a very stupid and ignorant individual in front
of a PC without giving him/her adequate instruction, you open a
Pandora's box of problems, one of which is this Virus/Trojan thing.
How many of your users can say whether this is true or false (for an
IBM PC; Mac is something else yet):

(1) Virus software can override write-protect tabs

(2) Viruses can spread via e-mail messages

(3) Viruses are the most common type of Trojan horse programs

(4) A virus can spread from a PC to VAX or VM and vice versa

Such a misinformed individual will typically pay some gonef $$$ for a
piece of code that TSRs and checks for INT 13 functions `write',
`format', `format fancy', `format fancy with twist', etc, without
analysing where they came from; it will produce too much output and
s/he will habitually turn it off; nevertheless, s/he will feel fully
protected and will promiscuously load all kinds of suspect software
and will never take a backup. (We have, by the way, a gay fellow, a
good mathematician, who does not believe that AIDS is caused by a
virus, or, for that matter, is spread sexually; and he's still alive!)

Subject: Request for information

  Hello.  I am wondering if any of you might be able to help
me.  I'm doing a study on viruses and would like to get any
information available on them.  Particularly I would like to
ask anyone who has a virus which has been disected with
accompaning documentation to send it to me. I am new to this
list so I have not had much time to read through past issues
yet.  I shall do that when classes resume.
    Could anyone explain to me how to construct a virus.
Just the basics will do nicely.  I'll gladly accept any
information that is sent to me no matter it's length.  I'll
also be needing information on how to deactivate the
'common' virus.
    I realize that this is a lot to ask, but I'm hoping that
many of you will respond and help me out.
I wish to state right here and now that I am not requesting a
living or active virus or trojan horse.  This is my third
revision and yet the clarity of my request still remains in
question.  I relize the severity of what I ask for, and for
all intensions I see no harm in it.  Please contact me directly
if there are any questions.

[Ed. Doug has revised this message a few times, and each time I sent
it back because he was requesting a copy of a virus; something which I
will not promote here on VIRUS-L.  I believe that it is a bad idea to
send copies of viruses to others, particularly when requested only via
e-mail.  I trust that anyone responding to such a request will
exercise due caution.]
