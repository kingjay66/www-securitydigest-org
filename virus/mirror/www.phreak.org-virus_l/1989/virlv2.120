Subject: Atari ST boot sector virus (possible new strain)

Last night I discovered a virus on my Atari ST.  It's a boot
sector type, and I caught it before it did anything more than
copy itself onto about 4 of my disks.  I was able to trace
the source to a disk of software I got from a friend of a friend
that supposedly came from Europe originally.
George Woodside's VKILLER program was unable to identify the
virus itself, but it was instrumental in helping to confirm that
it was self-replicating boot sector code.
I've sent a copy of the infected disk to Mr. Woodside. Should he
let me know what the virus was intended to do, and add detection
of it to VKILLER I'll let the net know.
Anyone desiring further information can contact me.

     First, my thanks to everyone who responded to my question about
this, both on the list, privately, and via phone. Thanks, guys!

     I have recovered the files from the disk (most of them, anyway)
and it does have all the earmarks of a virus - trouble is, I don't
know which one. The first (but not the second) copy of the FAT was
trashed, and the directory was damaged. The user tells me that the
same symptoms are starting to show up on their HD. I have a nasty
suspicion that they have IT!

Bill.

Subject: nVIR infection, other problems (Mac)

Apologies for a somewhat inappropriate posting, however I am concerned
about a lab of Mac II's that is to be used as for a Faculty Open House
next Wed., and as VIRUS-L is temporarily on vacation, I wasn't sure
how else to go about getting help.

We've had/are having some mild difficulties with nVIR in this lab, but
they are controllable.  However in the process of checking systems I
have run into a few other items which have worried me, and I can't
seem to match the symptoms with the info I have on known Mac viruses.

The worries began when a system refused a locked virus-fighting disk,
saying that it needed minor repairs (like INIT 29).  With a move
straight from deep space, I unlocked the disk and reinserted it, and
attempted to run Disinfectant 1.1.  It gave me a message that it was
corrupted by either a virus or disk error, and would not run.  I then
ran ResEdit and discovered that the Desktop contained, as it's first
resource, an unnamed resource.  When opened, it contained one resource
ID=0 which I cannot open.  Size: 1082208 (!!?!?)  Attributes:
Purgeable, Preload.

The last resource of the Desktop is call "<not equal sign>VIR", and
contains one resource ID=0.  It opens to show one line of data/code.
Size: 6 Attributes: Purgeable, Preload.

I checked a few other systems, and they had the same symptoms,
although one system had _two_ unnamed resources in the Desktop file.

Disinfectant 1.1 and VirusRx 1.4a2 say the disk is fine.  Anti-Virus
Kit from 1st Aid Software says there has been an infection, but
provides no info.  (We just received this, and so far I'm _not_
impressed).  1st Aid Kit HFS says the disk's directory is damaged and
that the disk is unusable.

Because of a lack of time (due to the upcoming Open House), I've not
had a chance to investigate further.  I'm not exactly a Mac
programming pro, and so I'm not sure if I should be suspicious or not.
I don't know whether to think it was just a disk error, or what.

If anyone has an insight into this situation, please PLEASE PLEASE
write directly to me and NOT to this list, so that traffic may be kept
at a minimum.  - Gregg
