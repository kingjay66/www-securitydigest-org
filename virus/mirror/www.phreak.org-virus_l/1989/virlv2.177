VIRUS-L Digest   Friday, 18 Aug 1989    Volume 2 : Issue 177
 
VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

        I want to thank everyone who mailed/posted responses to my
posting about the virus which infected my friend's disks. She think's
she's cleaned it out by copying only the source codes to new disks,
zapping the hard drives, and recompiling everything on the clean hard
disks.
        BTW, there is an article in this month's Popular Science on
computer viruses.
        Once again, Thanks

Forward from John McAfee
=============================================================================
 
    Hi folks.  I've had a large number of panicky calls, and Ken van
Wyk has had at least one 'emergency' message about a possible 1701
virus in the M-1704.EXE disinfector program.  What's happening is
VIRUSCAN is identifying the 1701 virus code within the disinfector
product.  The 1701/4 disinfector is the only one of our disinfectors
that causes this problem, and because of the very small de-garbling
code within the 1701/4 virus, there is no practical way around it.
Our choices are: 1. Remove the 1701/4 disinfector from circulation and
let people disinfect manually; 2. Change VIRUSCAN to ignore the
program (it's the only non-virus program we know of that looks like a
virus to VIRUSCAN); or 3. Continue as is.  I definitely do not want to
change VIRUSCAN to start and 'exclusion' list.  This defeats the
purpose of the scan program and reduces its reliability.  I also
believe that the value of the disinfector outweighs the confusion
factor.  I have stated up front in the documentation for M-1704 that
the user should contact us BEFORE trying to use the program so that we
can verify over the phone whether there is a possibility that the
program really is infected (a slim probability if downloaded from
SIMTEL or other reputable source).
    A second point I'd like to bring up is that people do not need to
stockpile disinfector programs.  Many of these programs are dangerous
if used on uninfected systems and even in infected systems, certain
disinfectors can have unpleasant side effects if used improperly.  A
disinfector should be used AFTER an infection has been verified.  It
appears that many people are collecting disinfectors and trying them
out so that they are prepared for an infection if one occurs.  I don't
think this is a good idea.  My final recommendation is: Read the
documentation and follow the instructions.  If you're using the M-1704
program, then call before you do anything with it.

Subject: Need info on Datacrime virus (PC)
 
Sorry if you get this message twice, I'm not sure if the first attempt
will get to you (its been one of those days :^)
 
I'm sure this has been discussed, but I just got back from
vacation and missed the info (we're low on disk and things get
purged quickly).
 
Can anyone tell me how to detect if a machine has been infected
with the Datacrime virus, what it does (I've heard that it is
supposed to erase files on a particular date), and how to get
rid of it.
 
I'd appreciate a response to this.  It will give me a good
opportunity to demonstrate to our security gurus that Usenet
can be beneficial to security (instead of the open door that is
usually portrayed by the media).

Hello all!
 
I don't know how many of you had noticed the few small mistakes in the
report about the "Swap Virus" but anyway, I am correcting it now.
 
The only mistake I found was in the INFECTION part section C.
 
   1) Instead of bytes 2B4-2E4 correct it to bytes 00B7-00E4 (A sector has
      only $200 bytes on it.
 
   2) The correct message at the end of the virus is:
 
         "The Swapping-Virus. (C) June, 1989 by the CIA"
 
 
I hope there are no more mistakes!
