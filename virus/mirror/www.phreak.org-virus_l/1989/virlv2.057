Subject:      Viruses and System Security (a story)

[Ed. reprinted from SECURITY Digest]

The following story was posted in news.sysadmin recently.

The more things change, the more they stay the same...

Back in the mid-1970s, several of the system support staff at Motorola
(I believe it was) discovered a relatively simple way to crack system
security on the Xerox CP-V timesharing system (or it may have been
CP-V's predecessor UTS).  Through a simple programming strategy, it was
possible for a user program to trick the system into running a portion
of the program in "master mode" (supervisor state), in which memory
protection does not apply.  The program could then poke a large value
into its "privilege level" byte (normally write-protected) and could
then proceed to bypass all levels of security within the file-management
system, patch the system monitor, and do numerous other interesting
things.  In short, the barn door was wide open.

Motorola quite properly reported this problem to XEROX via an official
"level 1 SIDR" (a bug report with a perceived urgency of "needs to be
fixed yesterday").  Because the text of each SIDR was entered into a
database that could be viewed by quite a number of people, Motorola
followed the approved procedure: they simply reported the problem as
"Security SIDR", and attached all of the necessary documentation,
ways-to-reproduce, etc. separately.

Xerox apparently sat on the problem... they either didn't acknowledge
the severity of the problem, or didn't assign the necessary
operating-system-staff resources to develop and distribute an official
patch.

Time passed (months, as I recall).  The Motorola guys pestered their
Xerox field-support rep, to no avail.  Finally they decided to take
Direct Action, to demonstrate to Xerox management just how easily the
system could be cracked, and just how thoroughly the system security
systems could be subverted.

They dug around through the operating-system listings, and devised a
thoroughly devilish set of patches.  These patches were then
incorporated into a pair of programs called Robin Hood and Friar Tuck.
Robin Hood and Friar Tuck were designed to run as "ghost jobs" (daemons,
in Unix terminology);  they would use the existing loophole to subvert
system security, install the necessary patches, and then keep an eye on
one another's statuses in order to keep the system operator (in effect,
the superuser) from aborting them.

So... one day, the system operator on the main CP-V software-development
system in El Segundo was surprised by a number of unusual phenomena.
These included the following (as I recall... it's been a while since I
heard the story):

- -  Tape drives would rewind and dismount their tapes in the middle of a
   job.

- -  Disk drives would seek back&forth so rapidly that they'd attempt to
   walk across the floor.

- -  The card-punch output device would occasionally start up of itself
   and punch a "lace card" (every hole punched).  These would usually
   jam in the punch.

- -  The console would print snide and insulting messages from Robin Hood
   to Friar Tuck, or vice versa.

- -  The Xerox card reader had two output stackers;  it could be
   instructed to stack into A, stack into B, or stack into A unless a
   card was unreadable, in which case the bad card was placed into
   stacker B.  One of the patches installed by the ghosts added some
   code to the card-reader driver... after reading a card, it would flip
   over to the opposite stacker.  As a result, card decks would divide
   themselves in half when they were read, leaving the operator to
   recollate them manually.

I believe that there were some other effects produced, as well.

Naturally, the operator called in the operating-system developers.  They
found the bandit ghost jobs running, and X'ed them... and were once
again surprised.  When Robin Hood was X'ed, the following sequence of
events took place:

  !X id1

  id1:   Friar Tuck... I am under attack!  Pray save me!  (Robin Hood)
  id1: Off (aborted)

  id2: Fear not, friend Robin!  I shall rout the Sheriff of Nottingham's men!

  id3: Thank you, my good fellow! (Robin)

Each ghost-job would detect the fact that the other had been killed, and
would start a new copy of the recently-slain program within a few
milliseconds.  The only way to kill both ghosts was to kill them
simultaneously (very difficult) or to deliberately crash the system.

Finally, the system programmers did the latter... only to find that the
bandits appeared once again when the system rebooted!  It turned out
that these two programs had patched the boot-time image (the /vmunix
file, in Unix terms) and had added themselves to the list of programs
that were to be started at boot time...

The Robin Hood and Friar Tuck ghosts were finally eradicated when the
system staff rebooted the system from a clean boot-tape and reinstalled
the monitor.  Not long thereafter, Xerox released a patch for this
problem.

I believe that Xerox filed a complaint with Motorola's management about
the merry-prankster actions of the two employees in question.  To the
best of my knowledge, no serious disciplinary action was taken against
either of these guys.

Several years later, both of the perpetrators were hired by Honeywell,
which had purchased the rights to CP-V after Xerox pulled out of the
mainframe business.  Both of them made serious and substantial
contributions to the Honeywell CP-6 operating system development effort.
Robin Hood (Dan Holle) did much of the development of the PL-6
system-programming language compiler; Friar Tuck (John Gabler) was one
of the chief communications-software gurus for several years.  They're
both alive and well, and living in LA (Dan) and Orange County (John).
Both are among the more brilliant people I've had the pleasure of
working with.

Disclaimers: it has been quite a while since I heard the details of how
this all went down, so some of the details above are almost certainly
wrong.  I shared an apartment with John Gabler for several years, and he
was my Best Man when I married back in '86... so I'm somewhat
predisposed to believe his version of the events that occurred.

I was speaking with my mother tonight and she said that the local news
had a story about a recent virus infestation at the University of
Utah.  She couldn't recall any of the details.  Any VIRUS-L readers
know of this?

Subject:  Why people write viruses...

After listening to the VIRUS-L discussion for a few months, it finally
hit me that maybe some people write viruses because... (well, let me
explain it in detail):

The people who write viruses are usually (if not always) people who
are very knowledgeable about computers. Being very knowledgeable about
computers, these people might look down upon novices, and might write
a virus, which would mostly affect novices (who sometimes barely even
know that viruses exist) while not affecting other experts (who are
aware of viruses and know the necessary precautions to avoid
infection). Thus, a virus-writer can get pleasure out of
confusing/disrupting the novices' efforts at learning about computers.
(I hope I explained this clearly enough.)

Subject:  FluShot+ 1.51 (PC)

I've just downloaded FluShot+ 1.51 from the RAMnet BBS in NYC and I've
noticed that I'm having the same problem with it that I had with
version 1.4......it gives me bad checksums on my command.com,
ibmbio.com and ibmdos.com.  However, all 3 files are okay.  Is it
looking for the "True Blue" versions of these files?  I have a Zenith
z-157 with MS-DOS 3.2.  Has anyone else had this problem?  I glanced
in the manual, there didn't seem to be a way to alter what it's
looking for (hardly suprising...that would be a major hole, in all
likelyhood....).  Any tips/advice would be appreciated.

Hi there folks, Me again.

Many thanks for the replies to my plea for help about the definitions.
(comments etc are still welcome).  I was suprised to find that out
those who replied, who obviously consider themselves knowledgeable
about the subject, their definitions did all slightly differ.  Below
is a summary of the replies I got, hopefully they are as correct as
the subject will allow (due to it's non-descript nature).  I would
gratefully receive anything that you would like to add.

TROJAN HORSE

A Trojan horse is a program that does something that the programmer
intended it to, but the user did not.  (And, generally, that the
user would not have approved of had he/she known about it.)

A trojan horse is a program which is concealed inside another, for the
purpose of executing inside another user's protection boundary (on his
PC, or in a job he runs on a system, or in his virtual machine in VM).

( The term also applies to programs which masquerade as others, as
might a password-stealing program which emulates a legitimate system,
and thereby fools a user into entering a password, which the TH then
"steals".  A compiler which, when executed, copies an unrelated file
to the compilerdiskette would be an example, too. )  Is this strictly
true?  I thought a Trojan Horse actually did something also.


WORM

A worm is a program which replicates itself through a network,
generally with the goal of consuming more system resources than would
be otherwise available to it.


VIRUS

A virus is, to quote Fred Cohen, "a program that can 'infect' other
programs by modifying them to include a possibly evolved copy of
itself".

A virus is a program which attaches itself to other programs (or
possibly to a disk, although that is a minor distinction in my view;
it is then attaching itself to the boot record, which is a program)
and when it gets control, attaches itself to more programs.  It may
also take some action, possibly at random or timed, in addition to the
replication.

Well that's it, who's Fred Cohen?

Thanks in advance ( we should abbreviate that, in the time honoured
tradition, like the best things are in computing to "T.I.A."  what do
you think?)

                                        Steve.

Subject:      Lab Procedures

We have a number of IBM-PC networks with read only file servers. We
have never had a virus problem there in their 5 years of existance. We
can boot from the network due to boot proms on our network interface
cards.  Our Appletalk/Mac labs are another story. We have to go thru
the disk washing procedure like many others here have described. We
would like to have a network interface card with a boot prom on our
Mac's also.  We would need a faster interface such as ethernet, but
the extra speed would benefit the customers as well as give everyone
some security from infection. We have been showing every Apple person
we get on campus how well our IBM labs work and saying we need the
ability to boot from Mac networks. Most Mac II ethernet cards have an
empty PROM socket and there is a mention of optional Prom functions in
the Apple adapters documentation. A scheme (or modification to MAC OS)
would have to be developed to allow people to customize their own
screens, desktops, etc.  as they are accustomed to. Of course the very
nature of the Mac OS and its modification of files (resources, etc) is
tailr made for the infection process of viruses.  Regardless the
ability to be able to boot from a network file server is very high on
our wish list from Apple. It would be well worth the additional cost
of an ethernet card for every Mac.

Subject: Re: Closed virus list proposal

I am against the formation of the list for a list of reasons:

1) I have yet to see a 'live' virus of any description and I have
downloaded and run probably 30Mb or more of PC software in the last
year.  How do I know that this list will not be the basis for the
creation of the first virus I will see?  How can I trust you any more
than you can trust me?

2) The information on how to 'protect' from viruses, if it is not to
be commercial, will tell how to build the very viruses that they
protect against.  How do I accept someone's word that the virus
protection program someone is hawking for $100 is useful much less
whether it is a valid program unless I know how it works?  If I know
how it works, what's the advantage of the list?

3) I do know how to build viruses.  What I'm looking for in this list
is further information on what else can be done to protect against
them.  I cannot get that information without being able to write them
as well.  Item 1 above led me to the construction of a couple of test
cases so I could check out a hardware solution to the problem using a
hardware debugger.  >From the descriptions of the viruses on the PC so
far, this solution should be complete, i.e. a software virus should
not be able to get past hardware protection methods.  I'm still
looking for a 'live' virus to try it out on.

4) I _refuse_ to purchase commercial software for virus protection and
may need all the informational help I can get.  Crime should not pay
for anyone and we all need to band together to keep the virus scare
from producing yet another market segment.  The formation of a private
list fosters that market segment by keeping information secret.

Now before anyone accuses me of heresy, let me add another comment.
If the list is formed, I need to be on it.  I do a great deal of
collection and review of PC software for the North Texas PC Users
Group and have valid need for the information that might be withheld
if this list is formed without me.  A single virus that slips past the
reviewers could fan out to several hundred people in a very short
time.  That would be very bad news!

Subject:      Virus psychology information

In response to "Commander Spock"'s question about sources of
information on why people write virus's, I suggest he look at a few
recent magazine articles (I really doubt any books have been on the
topic as of yet)

In the Summer issue of 2600 magazine there is an article by "The
Plague" called "How to Write a Virus: The Dark Side of Viruses".  He
claims to have written a viruse called CyberAIDS which attacks the
Apple II series, but besides his "qualifications" you can get a pretty
good idea of the twisted kind of mind who enjoy this kind of thing
(Mr. "Plague" claims to have no moral objections to trashing people's
hard work) The article goes into the theory of virus writing (not
system specific) A careful reading between the lines can provide a
psycological outline of one kind of virus writer.

you can get a back issue of 2600 by writing to 2600 Magazine, PO Box
752, Middle Island, NY 11953-0752.

You also may want to look up the Winter 1988 issue of "High Frontiers
Reality Hackers" for an article called "Cyber Terrorists / Viral
Hitman" Reading it between the lines also reveals a lot about the type
of person who would voluntarily release a virus.

PS I don't support, condone, or agree with any of these authors, I am
just bringing them up for a view of why people would write these
things.

Subject: Flushot+ 1.51 question (PC)

I've used FluShot+ 1.51 now for two weeks, and I'm quite satisfied
with it. I've noticed some strange behaviour when using PC-Tools (I
believe its version 4.5 (?)). Even with FSP installed I'm able to
rename, delete etc. the system files command.com, ibmbio.com and
ibmdos.com. When I try to do the same with any other utility (and
DEL/REN on the commandline too) FluShot behaves as expected: It warns
about the action.  I'm wondering what I'm doing wrong with my setup of
FSP+.  Or is PC-Tools using some very special method of writing to the
harddisk? (It uses neither INT13 nor INT26 for the DEL/Rename, because
if I EDIT (with PCTOOLS) COMMAND.COM FluShot gets triggerd).

Can anyone give me some more information?
