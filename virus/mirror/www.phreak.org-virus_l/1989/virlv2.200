VIRUS-L Digest   Monday, 25 Sep 1989    Volume 2 : Issue 200

VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: More on the CUPLVX Virus (VAX/VMS)

The following mail messages were posted to the INFO-VAX mailing list
in response to the message "Virus or Coincidence" posted by Tom Ivers
at the Columbia U. Plasma Physics Lab (IVERS@CUPLVX.APNE.COLUMBIA.EDU).
The message was posted to VIRUS-L in a previous isse.

Tom Ivers original mail message indicated that the VAX that had the
problem was running VMS 4.5.  VMS 4.4 through 4.7 had a fairly nasty
security hole in it that DEC has subsequently patched.  Perhaps this
system wasn't patched ?

Assuming the security hole wasn't patched, and LOGINOUT.EXE was
replaced then this type of attack has occurred before.  The last major
outbreak was when the Chaos Computer Club broke into machines on the
"World DECnet" (SPAN/HEPnet/Etc...) during the Summer of 1987.

Subject: Virus humour

Bit of trivia here.  I recently received a copy of issue 6 of the now
(unfortunately) defunct humour digest 'NutWorks'.  It contains an
article on a computer virus - a real organic virus that (supposedly)
attacked the latest development in computer memory, BRAM, Bacterial
Reproducible Active Memory.

The article was written in 1984.

Subject: RE: McAfee Posting

[Caveat Emptor: My copy of Virus-L V2 #198 seems to have been eaten by
the net, so I do not have my original message in front of me as a source.]

I believe both Chris McDonald and Kelly Goen missed the point of my
message about John's message, (which message? who? what?  ;-)

I agree wholeheartedly with Chris' characterization of Centel.  If
they are indeed purporting to be selling Viruscan for $25, they are in
flagrant violation of the law.  I deliberately tempered my remarks
about Centel as the only source of information I have about their
"offer" comes from a Washington Post article, and is consequently at
least third-hand (whereas my comments about John's posting were based
directly on his message).  For example, we know Viruscan is on the
disk, but how do any of us know that other utilities that Centel may
have developed are on the disk??  I could carry on these arguments for
awhile, but I suspect I've made my point here.  Relating this back to
my message about John McAfee's posting, I found his language
confrontational in the extreme, with no explanation as to why such a
tone needed to be adopted.

Kelly is levelling a rather serious charge at Centel.  If indeed
Centel was suggesting to purchasers of the disk with Viruscan that
they were buying the application, rather than covering distribution
costs, he is absolutely right, but as I suggest above, we do not have
enough information present to make this judgement.  Again, John's
message had no information backing this up.

The question has also been raised about charging for the distribution
of software.  I'm no lawyer, but I have the strong suspicion this is
perfectly legal (although as I stated about, a $25 distribution charge
"smells", to quote Chris).  Consider that several companies in the
United States sell disks full of public-domain, freeware, and
shareware applications.  When shareware is involved, these companies
(at least the better ones) explicitly state that a seperate payment is
needed.  Also remember that this is how many user groups generate
revenue (through the charge of a nominal distribution fee for a disk
of pd/fw/sw software.

Another question was raised about what say the author has in the
distribution of his or her work, when done under the auspices of the
"Shareware" label.  There is no question that when a piece of
shareware code is included in a commercial application or disk, the
author is fully within their right to demand payment, or place
restrictions on dissemination, or a host of other things.  I am not
aware of a precedent that allows a shareware offer to say in the
general case that a piece of shareware can be available from source A,
but not source B.  Furthermore, such an example (you can get the
software from source A, but not B) appears contrary to the philosophy
behind shareware.

Subject: Viruscan (PC)

The recent discussions of Viruscan have reminded me of something.  The
Computer Center folks recently asked me about Anti-virus packages for
PCs.  I wanted to pass on to them information about Ross Greenberg's
"FluShot Plus" and John McAffee's "Viruscan".  Anyone out there care
to synopsize these two (please include information about finding out
about site licensing...

Thanks!

It depends on how it accesses the disk.  If it uses bios calls (INT
13H), it will still attack physical cyl 0 on the disk.  If it uses the
dos absolute disk write call (INT 26H) it will wipe out whatever the
starting track of the dos partition is.  Even if it uses the bios call
though, and you've partitioned the disk so it doesn't touch dos's FAT
and directory, it will still wipe out the master boot sector where the
partition table is stored.  That wouldn't be so bad if you could make
FDISK simply put a new master boot sector on the disk, but
unfortunately FDISK insists on doing some general housecleaning which
may finish the job that datacrime started.  I'm not sure of the extent
of the housecleaning, so I can't say for sure.

How about backing up the hard disk, then setting the system date ahead to

I have to thank Jim Wright for pointing out to me the mistake I have

"DATACRM.DOC."  Correction has been made, but I do not intend to make
it a new version.  I apologize for the confusion.  Those who receive
copies directly from me starting Sep. 20 will have the corrected copy.

Sincerely,

Subject: should we fight fire with fire?

[Ed. The following message was sent to VALERT-L, not
VIRUS-L/comp.virus (where it should have gone).  Please send any
follow-ups here to VIRUS-L/comp.virus.  Also, there are already a
number of responses to this message in this (and the next) digest.
I've included most of them since they present different reasons for
vetoing Chris's idea of creating a virus fighting virus.  I will try
to keep the number of redundant messages on this to a minimum.]

     It would seem to me, as probably to most of you, that the
creation of yet one more virus would be the last straw.  But the other
day I had an idea that might have occured to the rest of you, or maybe
not.  I began to design a virus algorythm that would eventually serve
as the platform for the destruction of other viruses.  It's purpose
would be to infect single programs, single disks, or multiple disks in
the first, second and third versions respectively.  Before any alarm
sets in here about my intentions, I would like to say that the purpose
here is to aid in the effort to combat these little nasties.
     I am posting this info in the hopes that some of you will respond
with your thoughts on the moral, ethical, and legal aspects of such an
act as producing and spawning a virus that is intended to find and/or
kill off other viruses that it comes into contact with without causing
harm to any other software.  I have thought of many ways to detect and
defeat viruses in this manner.  I have not as of yet done any coding
beyond the replication stages.  The two methods that I am using are by
the boot sector and by piggy-backing com and exec files.  There are
others, but for obvious reasons I am not posting the source code or
other more elaborate techniques.
     Please send me your insightful comments on this subject.  I would
also like to know what you think about designing the software to
infect only the original user's system (this can be done) assuming it
was to be sold commercially.
     Thank you in advance for your help in this ethical dilema...

Subject: safety protocols

     In a recent digest, Jim Blakely requested some help in developing a
protocol for the prevention of contamination from outside viruses.  I
would suggest to him and to any of you the following:
  When confronted by the problem of constant disk swapping and usage
of disks from the outside, you should set up a machine that is not
connected in any way to any other.  Then in the event that a new disk
is to be used (one from the outside), this disk should be tested on
the new machine by one or more of the most trusted anti-virus programs
on the market.  This will insure that its introduciton into the
working environment of the facility will not cause any harmful
results.  If a disk were to be found infected, the user can then be
almost certain that his/her home machine was also infected.
     By implementing this policy it would help to insure a safer
environment for all.

Two objections:
1)  You need to get a new copy of Disinfectant if a virus attacks it
    and makes it refuse to run.
2)  Someone _may_ write a Disinfectant-specific virus that prevents it
    from checking itself and from noticing the virus.

  I don't care who you are - good, bad.. it doesn't matter, I don't
want *ANY* viruses!  This is *MY* computer system.  I prefer knowing
what's going on in here.  In order for you to create something that
will detect and erradicate all viruses but not harm any software or
applications - that is just a contradiction... I don't want to see my
files grow in size for any reasons.
   Viruses are sometimes modified by hackers and new strains appear,
so what is stopping someone from modifying your virus into a *bad*
virus that looks JUST LIKE the "good" one with the capability of
replacing the "good" one and wreaking havoc??
   If you started programming... stop.  That's my suggestion.
