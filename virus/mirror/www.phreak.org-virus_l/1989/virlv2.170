Subject: WARNING: New Mac virus (reposted from comp.sys.mac)
 
Another Macintosh virus named "nFLU" has been discovered at the
University of Minnesota.  This virus is identical to nVIR B,
except for the name change.
 
Disinfectant version 1.2 has been configured to recognize nFLU.
We recommend that all Disinfectant users obtain a copy of this new version.
 
Version 1.2 also contains a few other minor changes.  For a detailed
list of all the changes see the section titled "Version History"
in the online document.
 
Disinfectant is free.
 
Features:
 
- - Detects and repairs files infected by Scores, nVIR A, nVIR B, Hpat,
  AIDS, MEV#, nFLU, INIT 29, ANTI, and MacMag.  These are all of the
  currently known Macintosh viruses.
- - Scans volumes (entire disks) in either virus check mode or virus
  repair mode.
- - Option to scan a single folder or a single file.
- - Option to "automatically" scan a sequence of floppies.
- - Option to scan all mounted volumes.
- - Can scan both MFS and HFS volumes.
- - Dynamic display of the current folder name, file name, and a thermometer
  indicating the progress of a scan.
- - All scans can be canceled at any time.
- - Scans produce detailed reports in a scrolling field.  Reports can be
  saved as text files and printed with an editor or word processor.
- - Carefully designed human interface that closely follows Apple's
  guidelines.  All operations are initiated and controlled by 8 simple
  standard push buttons.
- - Uses an advanced detection and repair algorithm that can handle partial
  infections, multiple infections, and other anomalies.
- - Careful error checking.  E.g., properly detects and reports damaged and
  busy files, out of memory conditions, disk full conditions on attempts
  to save files, insufficient privileges on server volumes, and so on.
- - Works on any Mac with at least 512K of memory running System 3.2
  or later with HFS.
- - Can be used on single floppy drive Macs with no floppy shuffling.
- - Extensive online document describing Disinfectant, viruses in general,
  the Mac viruses in particular, recommendations for "safe" computing,
  Vaccine, and other virus fighting tools.  We tried to include everything in
  the document that the average Mac user needs to know about viruses.

Subject: Typo Virus (PC)
 
    I just began an analysis of the Typo virus and, as with all new
reported viruses, I ran McAfee's ViruScan against it as a first step.
Imagine my surprise when it identified it as the Ping Pong virus!
After tearing it apart, it turned out to be 90% original Ping Pong.
Someone has taken the Ping Pong Carrier mechanism and modified the
code that displays the bouncing dot to effect the typographical errors
reported by Y Radai.  I gave the disassembly to John and I believe
Scan version 33 discriminates between the two viruses.  John also just
gave me a copy of the new Datacrime-2 virus, which is a strange beast.
The encryption at the front of the virus is very different from the
1701/4 encryption method.  Included in the decryption code is a
routine to prevent looking at the code through debug, Codeview or
other single step utility.  I'll report back when I've ripped the
beast apart, meanwhile I gave John sufficient info to update ViruScan
so it can identify it (I think it's also included in V33).

Subject: Israeli Boot Virus (PC)
 
This is a forward from John McAfee:
============================================================================
 
    Mr Radai rightly points out that there are two boot viruses that
have emanated from Israel.  He suggests that we call the first one
(the one that causes letters to fall from the screen) the "Swap"
virus, since the message - 'SWAP Virus FAT12' appears in the modified
boot record.  I would heartily agree, except that the version I have
does not display such a message.  The thirty byte modification to the
boot record (in my copy), is program code - no data characters at all.
I don't know now whether we are talking about different viruses
(although both allegedly originated with Mr. Tal) or whether some
slight, or major, modification has been made to this virus in its
travels.  In any case, for the meantime, I will leave the VIRUSCAN
messages alone.  The original virus I still call the 'Israeli Boot',
the new virus I call the 'Typo'.  I will change the name to a more
acceptable name after someone has educated me on this issue.
    Thanks for bearing with me.

Disinfectant 1.2 has been added to the automatic file distribution for
those who are AFD'd to the VIRUSREM package at SCFVM. The file should
be distributed this evening.

Subject: FLU_SHOT+ V1.6 and Boot Blocks (PC)
 
There is a minor bug in FLU_SHOT+, V1.6, that will (depending upon the
version of DOS used) ocasionally trigger the Boot Block Has Changed
Message.  Ends up I forgot to zero out the top half of a register.
 
Fixed in V1.7.  (The beta's all went out today, by the way...thanks
for your patience!)
 
Some people have recently started telling me about V1.6 telling them the
boot has changed (under DOS 4.0) and (when they investigate it) they
find that to be true.  No firsthand verification yet, though...
