     One of these days I'm going to have to dig up my research
paper...  Sorry guys, Not yet. Yo! Commander Spock! That's a scary
idea you've come up with. Lets not try to spread that one about in
case no one has thought of it, ok? Now then, it seems to me that the
hardest bit of writing a virus is getting the damn thing to spread. So
if you can kill its spread abilities, you've killed the virus. But
what if we took a "live" virus, mangled its spread abilities a bit,
and then let the thing go with "instructions" to seek other viruses
like itself and copy it's spread abilities over their own. Then at a
certian date, have the lot of them "kill" themselves? You'd still have
a lot of copies out there until the date, maybe doing damage, but if
there was no other way to pull it off, you'd have a population
control.

[Ed. The idea of using anti-virus viruses (somewhat of an oxymoron)
was kicked around some time back; the more-or-less unanimous feeling
of VIRUS-L readers at the time was that it is a very bad idea.  Aside
from setting a bad precedent, it has the distinct possibility of
backfiring if someone alters your anti-virus virus to do something
that you hadn't intended for it to do.  Comments?]

Subject:  Request for info on possible Mac virus.

     On a Macintosh we've got here in the Academic computing center at
Xavier, we've got Macwrite on a hard-drive.  Whenever I've tried to
startup Macwrite, I get a system error with the ID of 02.  I remember
reading in one of the recent digests that there apparently was a virus
that caused this to happen.  Unfortunately, I deleted those messages
from my account concerning that topic.  Could anyone please tell me if
this is true, and if so, what can be done about it?

Thanks,

Ken's addition to my posting about the relevance of another posting
was appropriate. I rechecked the messages and found that the original
posting was citing another writer's usage of the term virus.  My
apologies about the light flame.

Well, you could possibly have any number of problems, not all of them
virus-related.

1) Your hard disk is getting an unreported read error on MacWrite.
   Duplicate the file and see if the copy will run OK. If so, run
   your hard disk's diagnostics and see if they come out OK. If not,
   call your dealer and take the drive in for service.
2) Your copy of MacWrite is bad. Replace it from a LOCKED, KNOWN-CLEAN
   copy and try it again.
3) Your System file is bad. Replace it in the same way.
4) You have an INIT or CDEV in the System folder which does not let
   MacWrite initialize properly. Move all of your INIT and CDEV files
   into a folder inside the System folder called "Disabled INITs" or
   something like that. If MacWrite runs after you reboot, try taking
   them out 1 at a time until MacWrite breaks again.
5) You have a known virus. Try running VirusDetective(tm) 2.0 against
   your hard disk. You will want to create another boot disk by copying
   a known-clean System to a blank disk and installing VirusDetective
   there. If you find a known virus, run the proper disinfectant (if
   one exists) to get rid of it. If it's the INIT 29 virus, VirusDetective
   will report it, and can remove it from your non-application files.
   You will have to restore your applications and System from known-clean
   copies.
6) You have an unknown, new virus. Run Interferon 3.1 or Virus Rx 1.4
   to look for possible infections. Then replace the possibly-infected
   files from known-clean originals.

Please drop me a note directly if you get to step 5 without fixing the
problem. Also, it would be interesting to know if any of the following
things happen:

1) Locked disks, when inserted, get the "This disk needs minor repairs"
   dialog. If so, you could have the INIT 29 virus, which I think is
   the one you are thinking about.
2) Printing of large documents fails at irregular intervals. This could
   be several of the viruses, INIT 29, Scores, Hpat, or nVIR.

Subject:      Malicious program classification

  Ken van Wyk has a very good point.  The distinction between
Error-exploiting, Feature-exploiting, and Hardware-exploiting programs
is an important one.

  A suggestion for virus classification:

  A kind of "standard notation" should be agreed apon which would tell
one the type of program and the way it operates in a single sequence
of characters.  The basis for such a system could be three kinds of
programs - Trojans, worms, and viruses -- standard definitions,
nothing new here; and three methods of activity - hardware, error, and
feature exploitation, as Ken suggested.

  If we use a three-letter code for each major type:

      VIR   - Virus
      WOR   - Worm
      TRO   - Trojan Horse program

  And a single character for the mechanism used:

      e     - error-exploiting
      f     - feature-exploiting
      h     - hardware-exploiting

  The combination <fVIR> would say a lot more than just "well, it
propogates itself through its use of the XXX operating system".  Most
MS-DOS programs fall into the fVIR or hTRO categories, and
CHRISTMA.EXEC would be a fWOR (as far as I know) under this notation.

  eWOR would quickly describe the RTM worm.

  This is only a suggested format for such a classification.
Unfortunately, the nVIR macintosh virus kind of throws a wrench into
the works, and I've left out other aspects that could be covered, such
as timed-dormancy, relative nastiness, the type of systems affected,
etc.  This could, however, be a starting point.

Subject:  MIS "Virus Briefing"

Has anyone else planned to attend any of the "virus Briefings" given
by MIS, with Dr. Cohen?  I'm interested in going to the Dallas
presentation if there will be others in the field who can share
experiences and knowledge.  I doubt that a one day briefing will be
that beneficial on it's own.

Subject:  FSP_15 (IBM Anti-Viral Software) bug??? (PC)

 I have been using Flu_Shot 1.5 (by Ross Greenberg) and am a lot
happier with this version than the previous, 1.4, because the new
version doesn't check CMOS ram.  However, I have noticed that using
DOS 3.3's PRINT command flags as a TSR by FSP_15 and hangs my 286
clone.  Anyone else use FSP_15????
