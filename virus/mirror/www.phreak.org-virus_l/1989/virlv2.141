Thanks for all your good work in studying the WordPerfect virus. I
haven't yett been infected by it, but since I am a WordPerfect 4.2
user, I suspect that I might be someday. Could you please send me a
uuencoded copy of the virus-eradication program you mentioned?  many
thanks!

(C)Brain infected many disks at the George Washington University.  It is
a product of some guy in Pakistan.  The only saving grace to this virus
is that it changes the volume name, as you must have noticed when it
infects a disk.  The virus replaces command.com with a new version that
is stored in some bad sectors on the disk.  THe new command.com has two
nasty functions.  First, when ever the disk is accessed, it checks to
see if the disk being accessed is infected.  If it isn't then it infects
that disk.  Second, it will periodically add more bad sectors to disks.
 
The virus can only be loaded by booting the computer with an infected
disk.  It becomes a big problem in environments were people sit down
and use already booted machines.  A printer pc was the main distributor
of the virus at GWU.  The version we faced did not seem to affect hard
disks.
 
The simplest cure we found was to boot a system with a disk that we were
positive was not infected, and then read the first sector off of that disk
with a block & track editor.  Finally, write the good 1st sector onto the
infected disk.  Be sure to write a booting sector to boot disks and
non-booting to non-booting disks.  As for the bad sectors containing the
command.com substitute, they are harmless without the companion boot
sector and are best just left alone.
 
This virus cost many of my friends a lot of data--we would love to meet
the guy who wrote it in some dark alley.  In any event, I hope this posting
is helpful.

Hi margie,
         having dealt with this problem as a consultant at a couple of
silicon valley corps I have just one issue to raise from your article.
In most cases the person who is the human causative agent in the
spread of an infection is in most cases totally unaware that some of
the disk that he/she/it is using are infected... thus it is kind of
hard to discipline that person... what could be done instead is to set
up a test cpu that the software can be run on first to attempt to
detect evidence of infectious agents(of course if the virus in
question has a sufficiently long pre-trigger level even that may not
be sufficient) (n.b. a pre-trigger is used in this context to describe
an interval that the virus will not manifest its infectious
capability)

# Introduction to the Anti-viral archives...
# Listing of 22 June 1989
 
This posting is the introduction to the "official" anti-viral archives
of virus-l/comp.virus.  With the generous cooperation of many sites
throughout the world, we are attempting to make available to all the
most recent news and programs for dealing with the virus problem.
Currently we have sites for Amiga, Apple II, Atari ST, IBMPC and
Macintosh microcomputers, as well as sites carrying research papers
and reports of general interest.  We don't yet have a site dedicated
to the "big boys", but are on the look.  There have been nibbles.
 
If you have general questions regarding the archives, you can send
them to this list or to me.  I'll do my best to help.  If you have
an archive site and would like to volunteer your site (and are in
a position to do so! :-), send me a message.  Also, if you have a
submission for the archives, you can send it to me or to one of the
persons in charge of the relevant sites.
 
With this update I'd like to welcome two new sites.  Mac folks
probably are already familiar with sumex.  Now it has been granted
"official" status.  :-)  Another new site is unm, which provides
ethics related papers (university policies, state laws, etc.).
Give it a look!
 
If you have any corrections to the lists, please let me know.
