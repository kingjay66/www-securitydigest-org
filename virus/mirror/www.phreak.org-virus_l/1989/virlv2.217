VIRUS-L Digest   Monday, 23 Oct 1989    Volume 2 : Issue 217

VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: Datacrime II (PC)

In his article dated 5-10-89, Yisrael Radai says that he has
discovered that Datacrime II does the low level format on every day
between Jan 1 and Oct 12 except Sundays.

I have a specimen of what I believe is Datacrime II.  My analysis of
it is different - it does the low level format on every day between
October 13th and December 31st inclusive, except *Mondays*.  Perhaps my
specimen is different to the one that Yisrael is reporting?  It
certainly announces itself as "DATACRIME II", and matches the rest of
his description in file size and avoidance of files whose second
letter is "B" and infection of both COM and EXE files.  Another
possible explanation is that the date comparison has not been
disassembled correctly by whoever did the disassembly, so could I ask
that Yisrael check his specimen;  if he is correct, then we have two
Datacrime IIs.

While on the subject of Datacrime in general, although the virus
certainly exists, there has not been a single reported infection in
the field in the UK, and I rather think very few indeed elsewhere.  On
the other hand, there seems to be a considerable tidal wave of media
scare building up in the run up to October 13th.  My advice to anyone
who might be concerned is:  work normally, take normal backups
regularly using Dos BACKUP or any other back up utility.

One thing that will happen is this:  there are, say, 10 million PCs in
the world.  If the average computer lasts 10 years, 3650 days, then on
average about 3000 computers go down per day;  I've been deliberately
conservative about these figures.  There is no reason to suppose that
October 13th will see significantly fewer of these normal failures.
Please remember that computers fail all the time, for assorted
non-virus reasons.

Myself, and a number of other researchers, have noticed that there
seem to be a number of viruses emerging that do not seem to exist in
significant numbers (or indeed, perhaps at all) in the field.  Could
it be thet virus authors are writing viruses and sending them directly
to the virus research community, so cutting out the middle man?  Or is
it that we are more alert now, and trap viruses before they get very
far?

Subject: Data on viruses in Brunnstein format?

I recently came across Fridrik Skulason's message to this
news group from 10 July 89 detailing the Icelandic Virus
in "Brunnstein Format". I was wondering if the 40 some
other known viruses and their mutants are similarily
cataloged and if this data is retreivable.

Thanks,

How do you know?  The only machines DOS runs on are PCs and compatibles.
UNIX implemented on these machines would be just as vulnerable as DOS.
The most obvious weaknesses of DOS are unimportant compared to the fact
that the hardware itself has no protection mechanisms.

Subject: 0 bytes in 1 hidden file, virus? (PC)

   When I run CHKDSK it reports "0 bytes in 1 hidden files" and I
am wondring if I have a virus. I have been unable to see a hidden file
with 0 bytes with PCTOOLS or Norton Commander. I would appreciate any
comments on how I could list all of the hidden files, or how does
CHKDSK find hidden files (i.e. is it looking for the second bit set ?)

Regarding a recent message sent which reproduced an IBM internal memo
about their VIRSCAN program:

I used this program on some PC's at work last week.  The program
VIRSCAN is the executable, however it uses two other files to obtain
the search strings and the message to be sent to the user if the
search string is found.  The search files are in ASCII and can be
modified to include more virus strings as necessary.  Obviously,
greater the search string, the less likely there will be a false
positive.  Since it reports the number of files searched and number of
disks checked, I suspect that this program would not be able to find
those viruses which reside on sectors which are then marked bad.

Actually, the file *type* is 'WORD', but it's not a Microsoft Word
document.  The 'WORD' document type is specific to MacWrite files.
Actual MS Word documents have a type of 'WDBN' and a creator of
'MSWD'.  The creator for MacWrite files is 'MACA' (short for
MacAuthor).

Incorrect assumption.  First it must be established that there *is* a virus.

>What I'm wondering now is: Is it confirmed that the STR ID 801 really *is*
>a sign of a virus? Is there any chance that it is a legitimate resource?

STR 801 *is* a legitimate resource in (at least) MacWrite versions 4.5
& 4.6.  It's also likely to be valid in files created by versions as
early as 3.0, and as late as 5.x.

To quote from an old copy of Tech. Note #12 (February 20, 1986) "Disk Based
MacWrite Format:

"FONT MAPPING - In the document's resources is a resource of type STR with
        the ID #801.  It contains a mapping of fonts to font resource IDs
        and information on real fonts.  This resource begins with a word...."

>(I've tested making new MacWrite documents with a locked copy, They have
> resources this 'International Resource' and a STR resource ID 701,

I think you mean STR 700 -- I don't know of any MacWrite format that
uses a STR with an ID of 701.  If you're curious, STR 700 contains the
fifteen most commonly used letters in whatever language MacWrite
happens to be set-up for.  It's used as an encryption/decryption key
for MacWrite's nibble-wise text compression scheme.

In conclusion, STR 801 is nothing to worry about, (1) because it's
supposed to be there, and (2) because, *in and of itself*, it couldn't
transmit a virus since no known program, and certainly no portion of
the Mac Toolbox or OS, is going to try to load a STR resource into
memory and execute it.

All in all, from the evidence listed above, there's no reason to
believe there's *any* form of virus present.

For the avid followers of statistics just a quick note from the September
89 USENET readership report, comp.virus now has:

14000 estimated readers worldwide, is received by 87% of all sites,
averages 214 messages a month (352Kbytes), no crossposting to other
groups, costs 4 cents per month per reader to distribute and is
read by 2.7% of all newsreaders.

Subject: Re: The not-so-new virus (Mac)

We have not seen any symptoms of the MacWrite-attacking MacWight virus
at this site, but on seeing the messages about it, I started looking for
STR 801 resources.  I doubt if they have anything to do with the virus.

A scan of my hard disc showed that something like half the MacWrite docs
had STR 801 in them.  There didnt seem to be any pattern in which files
had STR 801 and which didnt.  The STR 801s are not all the same size, BTW.
Opening a file which did not have it with MacWrite4.6M had the effect of
adding a STR 801.  In response to a local enquiry, a colleague said:

> I don't have all that many MacWrite docs. on my hard disc, but I managed

I suspect that STR 801 is legitimately used by newer versions of
MacWrite for its own inscrutable purposes.  Disclaimer: only Apple or
Claris can make a definitive pronouncement.

Paranoid speculation follows.

Maybe someone is using the Joker's trick.  There could be several
infected applications out there, all quietly spreading harmless-looking
things like STR 801 that dont ring GateKeeper's alarms, but when they
all come together in one application, the real virus is triggered...

Plug for Virus Detective: with this it was easy to search for all files
containing STR 700 (legitimate MacWrite resource) or STR 801.  All the
other virus detectors I've seen have the symptoms to look for
hard-wired.  I have no relationship with the author other than being a
satisfied customer.
