Subject: New virus? - further report (Mac)

Here is a further report on the possible virus at the U of R.  The
student consultants at the University computing center made copies of
programs they believed infected and sent them to our computer center.
I had an infected copy of Macwrite 5.01 for a while., where I
discovered the added STR and the changed ICN.  I have had reports of
Macwrite II being attacked, but the info I have is inconplete.  I am
still trying to get another infected program, but I am never around
when an infected disk is found.  When I get one those that requested a
copy will be sent one via email, if it works.  The infected System on
the consultants' hard drive is 6.0.2, and the only symptom it has
shown so far is the "Last Modified" date and time change at irregular
intervals, including this morning.  I was able to induce a change by
repeatedly doing a Get Info on the system.

The virus probably found its way onto the disk when a consultant put
recovered files from a disk showing what may be sysmptoms of the virus
onto the hard drive.  Vaccine is installed in teh System folder, and
did nothing.  The system also has NVIR immunity.  The applications
known to be attacked, so far, are Macwrite 5.01, Macwrite II, the
System and its associated files.  All of them, even the clipboard.  I
just watched to Last Modified date change on Laserwriter change during
a copy.  (Needless to say the consultants are working on replacing and
File Locking everything.  This appears to protect against the virus.)
I will obtain copies of the infected stuff and try to do some
comparisons using Resedit.

To repeat, Disinfectant 1.2 has no effect, and Vaccine does not
protect against it, at least from infecting within a disk.  I plan to
spend today working with infected and non-infected programs, and
report my findings, and those of the others working on tis problem.

You're discounting the fact that your machine could be on a network. Having
an infected machine on a network where one transfers files between machines
can be just as bad as sticking a floppy in the machine.  One shot does
not cure all

It would cause too much of a loss of productivity and interruption of
the work routine.  Night is better if you're going to do it. Plus the
public embarrasment of having ones machine checked. Seriously, its
kind of like any test for drugs or AIDS or anything like that. Its not
so much as to whether you are infected, but just the idea that it was
done. After all, why have a test done if there isn't some
suspicion...This at least would be the view of most people around
those who had their machines tested.  'Did you hear George got busted
by the Tiger Team last week?---They didn't find anything, but you
never know....'

>If anything is found, you are "cited" as letting a virus into your system.

What exactly does 'cited' mean? Disciplined?, public marked as a
electronic leper in the company? fired? --Now that we've established
how they would operate, what should be the penalties for those
'caught'?

I tried to e-mail but the message bounced.

I do not recognize the virus by your description, but if it is new
then no one will including the antiviral apps that you mention.

I can recommend Symantec's new antiviral package, SAM, which will flag
any abnormal writes from an application (like Vaccine if you're
familiar with it, but better than Vaccine).  SAM will at least protect
your machines from getting infected and also has a Virus scanner
program that scans for known viruses and can also repair irreplaceable
apps that are infected.  Part of the protection init also will ask you
if you want to scan a floppy for known viruses whenever you insert
one.

I also recommend that you contact Symantec and give them a copy of
your virus so they can update their Virus scanner program.

Symantec can be contacted at (408) 253-9600, (800) 441-7234.

Please keep the net posted on further developments with this virus.  I
would especially be interested to know if the SAM INIT flags infection
attempts by the virus.

Thanks

Subject: Columbus Day Virus in the Military

While I did not see the computer chronicles report referenced by a
poster in a recent Virus-L edition, I would propose that there really
is no accurate way at the present time to gauge any computer viral
infection within the military given existing policies and
organizational structures.  The diversity of organizations has
resulted in differing policies as to whether such reporting is or is
not mandatory.  This "discretionary" rather than "mandatory" reporting
ensures in my opinion that viral infections go unreported.  Indeed, I
am aware of an outbreak of the Israeli B virus strain which infected
several PCs at a particular Army activity which I subsequently learned
was not reported through its chain-of-command.  In all fairness the
written policies applicable to that activity do not make reporting
mandatory.

In so far as the Columbus Day virus is concerned, the Army's
Information Systems Command through a variety of sources has tapped
the resources of Virus-L to alert its users as to the potential
threat.  An advisory message on the subject has been distributed
utilizing information first seen on Virus-L.  Other Army Commands have
retransmitted the same information.

I would like to propose that the military subscribers to Virus-L
perhaps pursue the problem of reporting by answering these questions:

    1.  Has your site experienced a viral infection?

    2.  What viruses were present?

    3.  Was it reported to the next level of command?

I am volunteering to compile the results and then post a summary of
the responses received to Virus-L.  I will of course ensure the
confidentiality of the identity of all sites.  Responses should be
sent to me directly at <cmcdonal@wsmr-emh10.army.mil>.  If this is
unacceptable, then perhaps someone out there in NETLAND has a better
idea.  Parenthetically, I wonder if Ken might provide a breakdown of
who actually subscribes to Virus-L in terms of military, university,
and contractor subscribers?  This would be important to assess the
level of participation.

[PS:  Congratulations on your marriage!]

[Ed. Thanks!  It would be extremely difficult to quantify the
different VIRUS-L subscribers, particularly since we're now
distributing VIRUS-L via the comp.virus Usenet newsgroup.  I can tell
you, however, that the actual mailing list contains just shy of 1300
subscribers, over 200 of which are redistribution points.  These sites
represent a solid cross-section of educational, commercial, military,
and government sites in several countries.  Most (perhaps 70%) of the
sites are educational, with approximately equal numbers of com, mil,
and gov sites.  Let me stress that these are not accurate numbers for
any sort of statistical analysis.]

Subject: NIST Special Publication

I would like to add some additional thoughts to those who have already
commented on the NIST "Computer Viruses and Related Threats: A
Management Guide."

1.  I believe there is a signifiant error on page 2-6.  The report in
discussing the INTERNET Worm states: "It was unclear what the network
worm's objective was, as it did not destroy information, steal
passwords, or plant viruses or Trojan horses."  I think there is
substantial evidence to prove that the Worm in causing denial of
service attacks did indeed destroy information.  Donn Seeley has made
the point that the author of the Worm program specifically "deleted"
an audit file so as to hide his location.  There are also numberous
reports that the program successfully "captured" passwords on other
hosts to which the Worm author was not entitled.  The NIST authors
reference Dr. Spafford's report on page A-1 which addresses the
"stealing" of passwords.  Both Seeley's and Spafford's analysis of the
incident can be found, along with other related papers, in the Jun 89
edition of the "Communications of the ACM."  This ACM edition is
probably the best reference on the entire incident available in the
public domain.  I think it should have been included in the NIST
reference list.

2.  I differ from several commentators who suggest that the document
is "prejudiced" against the use of public domain and shareware
products.  I think on pages 3-3 and 5-3 the document stresses only
that organizations should develop a clear policy on the acquisition
and on the use of such software.

3.  I am struck by the lack of any reference to Virus-L, RISKS Forum
and other INTERNET services which have for years provided we users the
best available, open source information on the subject of computer
viruses.  There is also little in the way of reference to the work of
professional associations such as ACM, IEEE, the Computer Security
Institute, and the Information Systems Security Association in
addressing the computer virus phenomenon.  Surely "technical
managers", who are the audience for this publication, could use such
resources to implement the virus prevention suggestions in the NIST
publication.
