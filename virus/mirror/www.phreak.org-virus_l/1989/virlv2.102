Subject: Missouri Virus (PC)
 
The Homebase group has logged over a dozen occurrences of this virus
but we have never successfully sampled it.  The latest occurrence was
notable enough to pass on to Virus-L so that we might get some
assistance.  The occurance was at the National Security
Administration.  The virus came into their shop on a disk shipped with
the book - "DOS Power Tools", published by Bantam.  This was the third
report of the virus entering an installation on this book.  The virus
completely disables writing to the hard disk, but it does allow normal
reading of data already stored.  Every site that has been hit has
destroyed or lost the original source disk, and the target disk.  The
NSA is no exception.  Robert Dimsdale of the NSA in Fort Meade
originally reported the virus to the CVIA and he cut the floppy into 8
sections prior to calling.  He then disrarded the standard CVIA advice
and low level formatted the hard disk.  Anyone with any additional
information about this virus is invited to share that information with
what we already know by contacting the HomeBase board.  We know that
Missouri is a virus and not a Trojan because we have documented four
occurances of its replication.  Please do not contact Mr. Dimsdale
directly.  Serious inquiries should be addressed through Jim Corwell
on Homebase.  He will pass on your name to the NSA and they will
reply.
 
Another report that came in on the same day, co-incidentally, involved
another book called - "Using Application Software" from Random House.
It was reported at Florida International University, contact name -
Mitchel Zidel.  We have not yet followed this one up.  If any of you
folks would like to join the Sleuth Team, contact Jim and sign up for
this one.  He has the phone number and specifics.
 
P.S. A number of HomeBase users would like to communicate with
Virus-L.  They are all, however, local BBS users and none (with one or
two exceptions) have access to Usenet or Bitnet.  How can I go about
posting their mail on Virus-L?

Subject: Net Hormones Paper by David S. Stodolsky
 
I read with interest the subject paper which resulted in some questions.
 
First, if contact tracing is technically possible among hosts and
networks, is the proposed "theory of operation" described in paragraph
4 of the paper really practical?  Dr. Stodolsky proposes that: "In the
event that a system is identified as infected, the transaction codes
which could represent transactions during which the agent was
transmitted are broadcast to all other computers."  The words "which
could represent transactions" suggests that an attack which used a
delay mechanism or "time bomb" approach would make it extremely
difficult to identify suspect transactions in a timely manner.  It
might also suggest that the historical record of transactions would of
necessity be inordinately large and for practical reasons might be
difficult to implement.
 
Second, even though Dr. Stodolsky stresses that the contact tracing
operation would alert a system to the "possibility" of an agent's
presence, does this represent a significant improvement over other
more conventional means to broadcast alerts of a potential problem, as
is now done over the Internet?  For example, if I were running a BSD
version of UNIX last November, the tcp-ip broadcast alert--assuming
the gateways were still up and functioning--might have been adequate
to respond to the Internet Worm.  If "contact tracing" had been
available, however, would not non-BSD UNIX systems have received
"alerts" which would have caused unnecessary concern?
 
Third, if the alert through contact tracing is to "restrict further
transmission of the agent," is not cutting off communications among
hosts on a network the only practical solution pending further
investigation?  If so, do we not have the mecahnism to do that now,
however imperfectly?

Subject: Trojan REXX EXECs (VM/CMS)
 
I have noticed that a number of "mischievious" (? spelling) EXECs
(VM/CMS) capture information in the NAMES file on one's disk and
forward themselves to users listed in one's names file.  Is there any
way to prevent this (forwarding) from occuring should, by chance and
unknowingly, an EXEC be invoked?
 
[Ed. How about renaming (or encrypting) your names file all the time,
except when you're in MAIL or MAILBOOK?  Not elegant, perhaps, but
probably effective.]

Subject: Problem in BASIC virus related? (PC)
 
      One of our guys wrote a BASIC file which reads one ASCII
file and writes it out to another ASCII file (just a different
arrangement of the data.) The interpreter & compiled versions
worked perfectly at our main site (on PS/2 Model 60).
 
      Same guy went to outlying research facility.  The interpreter
version ran fine (on AT machine).  Guy did a DIR B: of disk 1 which
contained data files.  Then Guy did DIR B: of disk 2 (which contained
a basic compiler).  The FAT of disk 2 got overwritten by ASCII
characters of file info about disk 1.
 
      We could not recreate the error on the AT nor back at our
main site.  This sounded like a problem with the buffers,
so i Suggested they:
 
      increase # files & buffers in CONFIG.SYS;
      boot from back-up copy of original DOS disk & do a SYS C: ;
      set file attribute on COMMAND.COM to READ ONLY;
      check for viruses;
      have tighter controls on what software is put on machine.
 
But if any of you folks out there have other suggestions, please write me.
Thanks.
