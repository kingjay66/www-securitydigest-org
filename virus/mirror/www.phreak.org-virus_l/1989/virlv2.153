That's not a virus, someone broke in or did it as a joke.

The following message is forwarded from John McAfee:
=============================================================================
 
    I would like to thank the Virus-L subscribers for their response
to the VIRUSCAN program.  I have just released the production version
which fixed a few bugs found in the earlier versions and includes all
the viruses I know about.  I would hope that those of you with large
virus collections would check it against the virus versions that you
have collected.  We have received no reports of false positive
identifications as yet, but it is certainly possible that new
variations of existing viruses will slip by.  I have collected only
one version each of the 3066 (Traceback) and the FuManchu for example,
and I don't have a good feel for the types of variations that might
appear with these viruses.  The tests for these viruses may therefore
be weak.  Also, the test for the Icelandic virus was developed and
implemented by Frank Nalls, who reports that it works fine.  Since I
do not yet have a copy of the Icelandic, I can only take his report on
faith.  I would be interested in anyone else's experience with
VIRUSCAN's ability to identify the Icelandic.
    Again, thank you all for your support and voluminous feedback.

I am using UNVIRUS to exterminate viruses. UNVIRUS also exterminates the
Bouncing Balll Virus. This program deletes the virus from the boot sector
but it *DOES NOT* fix the FAT so that the sector which was marked as bad
would be un-marked.
 
Is there a program to un-mark the bad sector???

Subject: Corporate culture shift resulting from virus mis(?)information
 
I am actively involved with a large microcomputer BBS for Mechanical
Engineers (CIME-ISE, 608-233-5378).  I will be giving a talk on the BBS
at the International Computers in Engineering Conference this August in
Anaheim, and am preparing a piece that will appear in the magazine
Mechanical Engineering, the main organ (as they say) of the American
Society of Mechanical Engineers (circ. approx. 130,000).
 
I understand that the messages here are in general somewhat academic and
technical, but perhaps the following line of discussion may spark some
interest.   I am intrigued by what can only be called the return of MIS:
we all know the corporate Kulturkampf that took place not so many years
ago when microcomputers became readily available--the MIS people (in large
corporations) kicked and screamed, but eventually their power was diluted.
Now, I am seeing reports that their day has returned.  Relatively techno-
illiterate upper management sees reports on viruses in Time, etc., and puts
a call in that all decisions on software must be blessed from a newly power-
ful management structure.
 
Consider the following case, which I consider emblematic:  a project engineer
at a large chemical installation plant can
1) sign off on $50,000 daily, but igf
 
    but if he wants a $200 copy of wordstar, e.g., he must ask his piping
supplier to buy it and bury it in an invoice;
2) he must use some cock-a-mamie line editor on his central computer; he, and
many other engineers, circumvent this by burying their favorite programs on
some hidden directory (of course against compnay policy)
3) he is being hassled about using the engineering BBS, and all BBS's in
general.  A valuable resource is being maligned and his productivity will
suffer.
 
I have no doubt that such corporate shenanigans are taking place all
the time, and would be interested in any comments.
 
Thanks for your time in reading this,

Subject: Re: Virus Identification Software
 
Last thursday i spoke with the author of the VIRUSCAN software Mr.
McAfee. Based on that conversation i would like to present the
following info concerning the scan program:
 
   1. There is indeed a slight problem when running scan.exe with
   a DOS version of 2.11 and perhaps any version under 3.0. The
   scan results apparently are not correct when scanning/searching
   "multiple" diskettes in Drive A. So the apparent fix for the problem
   is to either a) type the "dir" command before inserting and scanning
   succeeding diskettes or b) hit the Ctrl C keys before running scan
   on the next disk. If the user does not do this they will probably NOT
   get an acccurate scan and report of the files on the disks following
   the first diskette searched. And you could possibly have infected files
   on a diskette that would not be identified. This problem is easy to
   duplicate if you run scan.exe on multiple disks using DOS V2.11.
   I was able to duplicate the problem on my NCR PC-6 machine.
   One other user also reported in a previous VIRUS-L posting that he had
   experienced the same thing.
 
   2. Also according to Mr. McAfee V019 was a beta test version and
   Version020 is now available on the HOMEBASE BBS for downloading.
 
Maybe someone could grab V020 and check it out. If OK then send it to
SIMTEL20 for people on the Internet to obtain.

Subject: FluShot+ and 1701 virus (PC)
 
Things I've learned since my first message on our virus:
 
There is a 'Virus Epidemic Center' at University Hamburg (Prof. Brunnstein) and
their VIRUS-KATALOG list something called Herbstvirus or Blackjack. It's
description sounds similar to our symptoms although it increases *.COM files by
1704 bytes while our virus needs 1701.
 
On one mailing list I found an announcement:
   'DVIR1701.EXE -- detects and removes 1701 from COM files'
 
After installing Flushot+ and executing one of the infected files FSP brought
up the message:
   'An attempt is being made to infect your system by:
    Cascade Virus (aka 1704 Virus)                     '
Beside that experiment no further problems were revealed by FSP and our system
is still up and running.
 
Things I still would like to know:
 
Did someone unassemble this virus?
What was it supposed to do?
Can infection be caused by other programs than those identified by 01 FA 8B EC?
Can other files be already corrupted by this virus?

Subject: Request for boot sector information
 
I need an answer to the following question:
 
    In the boot sector of every diskette and hard disk there is a short
    string starting at the fourth byte. This string contains information
    about the version of DOS used to format the disk/diskette.
    Typically it is something like "IBM   3.0" or "MSDOS2.0".
    What I need to know is: What other possibilities are there ?
 
The reason I'm asking this question is as follows:
 
    I'm working on a package of programs for fighting computer
    viruses on the PC. One program in this package tries to determine
    if the boot sector has been infected by some virus. Since some
    viruses modify the label described above, it is one of the things
    I check on each diskette. For example, one well-known virus will
    write 1234 in this place, and another (the Pentagon virus) will write
    "HAL" there.
 
    Now - my problem is that one person who was using a beta-test version
    of the program told me that the program would flag diskettes formatted
    on a Cordata machine as "Possibly infected by an unknown virus".
 
    Examination revealed that the reason was the string "CDS" instead of
    "IBM" or "MSDOS". Therefore I am asking for a bit of assistance.
    If you have a machine from somebody other than IBM, please take a look
    at this portion of the boot sector, using NORTON or some similar program.
    If it contains a string different from "IBM", "MSDOS" or "CDS", please
    send me information on the string and the machine type.
 
Of course - the package will be distributed freely when finished - Expect
it to appear on comp.binaries.ibm.pc or in some accessible place.
 
I just need to obtain a few more viruses to test it against first. Currently
I have only tested it (and found it 100% effective) against Brain, Ping-Pong,
1704 and a new Icelandic (I think) virus.
 
This message would have been posted to comp.virus, but since it is not
operating right now, I am posting it here.
