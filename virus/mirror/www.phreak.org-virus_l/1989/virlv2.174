VIRUS-L Digest   Monday, 14 Aug 1989    Volume 2 : Issue 174
 
VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU.  Information on
accessing anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

Not to prolong the technical discussion too long, but...
Kelly Goen and Alan Roberts are both completely correct
(or, actually, I'll assume they are, not knowing myself!);
CodeView probably does get confused by the odd things the
virus does.   I always use good old DEBUG for initial
examination of viruses, because I know exactly what it's doing!
(CodeView is much more powerful, but for that reason
also more complex.)   I didn't get thrown out to DOS at
any point, but I *did* notice that the virus was doing
some bizarre self-alteration, decided that it was trying
to avoid being single-stepped, and then confirmed that
by experiment.  (If you single-step through it, it
degarbles to garbage, rather then to the actual virus code.)
So I never got to observe the effect that Kelly and
Alan saw!   (So I don't think anything I said was
"fallacious"; we were just talking about different effects.)
 
Alan asks a good question about disassemblies.   I think
it's probably a Good Thing if at least two or three people
do independant disassemblies of each virus, just to make
it less likely that something subtle will be missed.  I
know my disassemblies (except the ones I've spent lots of
time on) always contain sections marked with vaguenesses
like "Does something subtle with the EXE file header here".
At some point, I guess, some time does start to be wasted
by duplication of effort; hard to say where, though.  I
probably tend to lean towards "the more the merrier"!

Networked Apple Laserwriters aren't really subject to permanent virus
infestation, since a power-off cycle will clear their RAM.
 
HOWEVER, a proficient Postscript programmer can deposit code in an LW's
memory which can stay resident and affect other users' output until the
power is cycled.  These modifications can include re-defining standard
Postscript operators to do different things (such as "showpage" could
be extended to overprint the word "CLASSIFIED" on every page printed).
 
PostScript has a password mechanism to prevent some alterations to persistent
parameters (such as printing a start-up page), but many users leave the
password un-set.

Subject: Disk Killer (PC)
 
Does anyone know of a virus called "Disk Killer" ?
 
My IBM PC is seriously being infected with this virus.
The system hung and can't be brought up by any means.
I tried to use firmware to re-format the hard disk.
The formatting completed without any error message but
the computer still does not work.
 
I need help to remove or kill this virus.

Not a good idea.  At the rate it is being updated, anything that eventually
got through c.b.i.p would be long out of date.

If you can send email, you can access some of the archive sites.
I think its safe to say that you have access to email, right?
Here is a note I received from a VIRUS-L reader.  He was able to get
through to simtel using only email.  Before trying this, CHECK THE ARCHIVE
SITE LIST FOR THE SERVER NEAR YOU.  Overloading this one poor site would
not be a nice thing to do.

You can also get help, which will explain what is going on here.

About the UNIX anti-archive site at wustl.edu.  This sounds great, but
since we (and a lot of other people) aren't on the Internet, we can't
get to it.  Would it be possible to set up an anonymous UUCP account
or an archive-server mail demon on the system?  Many people would be
grateful.
 
[Ed. This was sent to me personally, but I thought that others may be
interested...  The answer is that the people coordinating the Unix
archive sites are working on the problems.  We hope to be able to make
a mail-archive and an anonymous UUCP available in addition to the
current anonymous FTP.  No estimate on time, but it's being worked
on...]

Subject: Viruscan test (PC)
 
    For the past couple weeks I have been testing the latest
versions of John McAfee's virus scanning program, Viruscan,
downloaded as SCANV29.ARC, SCANV33.ARC, etc., and very briefly
the resident version archived as SCANRES4.ARC.
 
    While I have not completed the testing protocol with each
virus, perhaps an interim report will be of interest.
 
    The testing protocol is:
      1. Scan a disk containing a copy of a virus in some form;
      2. Have the virus infect at least one other program (for
         .COM and .EXE infectors) or  disk (for boot infectors)
         so Viruscan must locate the virus signature as it would
         normally be found in an infected machine;
      3. Modify the virus in the most common ways people change
         them (cosmetic changes to ASCII text messages or small
         modifications to the code and try Viruscan again.
 
    Step 2 arises from testing another PC anti-virus product
which was supposed to scan for viruses.  When I found that it
would not detect a particular boot virus on an infected floppy,
I asked the software vendor about it.  I was told that it would
detect a .COM program which would produce an infected disk - not
useful to most people with infected disks, the common way this
virus is seen  Even though the viruses tested are not technically
self-mutating, my intent is to test Viruscan against later
generation infections, as they would be found in a normal
computing environment.
 
    Naturally, there is a problem knowing which virus is actually
being found, since they go under different names and are
frequently modified.  The viruses are currently identified by
their length, method of infection, symptoms of activity or
trigger, and any imbedded text strings, based on virus
descriptions from a variety of sources. These include Computers &
Security journal, and articles which have been on Virus-L, such
as Jim Goodwin's descriptions modified by Dave Ferbrache, and
reports by Joe Hirst from the British Computer Virus Research
Centre.
 
    There is  a proposal for  checksumming of viruses in the June
Computers & Security, which would allow confirmation that a found
virus is the identical one already disassembled and described by
someone.  In the meantime, identification has been made as
mentioned.
 
    So far, Viruscan has detected the following viruses:
 
    Boot infectors - Brain, Alameda/Yale, Ping-Pong, Den Zuk,
      Stoned, Israeli virus that causes characters to fall down
      the screen;
 
    .COM or .EXE infectors - Jerusalem -several versions
      including sURIV variants, 1701-1704-several versions,
      Lehigh, 1168, 1280, DOS62-Vienna, Saratoga, Icelandic,
      Icelandic 2, April First, and Fu Manchu.
 
    SCANV33 has a byte string to check for the 405.com virus, but
does not detect it.  SCANV34 has been modified to allow proper
detection.
 
    SCANRES 0.7V34, the resident version of Viruscan, correctly
detects the 405 virus when an infected program is run.
 
    I have not had any false positives on other commercial or
shareware programs that have been scanned.  Viruscan appears to
check for viruses only in reasonable locations for those
particular strains.  If there is a virus that infects only .COM
files, and an infected file has a .VOM or other extension, it
will not be reported.  Of course, it is not immediately
executable, either.
 
    On the other side of the coin, if a disk has been infected by
a boot infector, and still has a modified boot record, it will be
reported by Viruscan.  This is true even if the rest of the virus
code normally hidden in other sectors has been destroyed, thus
making the disk non-bootable and non infectious.  This is a
desirable warning, however, since the boot record is not
original, and since other disks may be still infected.
