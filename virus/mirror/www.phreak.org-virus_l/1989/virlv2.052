Subject:  nVIR virus on Mac SE

I have a virus on my Mac SE which installs itself as resource "nVIR"
in applications. It does not appear to damage documents, and appears
to be unable to get through locked files.  It does damage those
applications it enters, but not all of them (Resedit OK) others work
erratically for a while and then won't launch. Telltale signs were
modification dates on applications just after they launch.

If any one knows of this virus, please let me know what would be the
best way to eradicate it.

P.S. It also modifies some system files possibly (Macromaker, System)?

As others have pointed out, many terminals do support sendline and
sendpage functions and although some mailers block escape characters,
not all do.  This is also a problem with finger, which can be done
remotely, and with systems that do not provide adequate protection for
user's /dev/tty* devices (still the case on many unix systems).
Unless you know that your terminal or emulator does not support such
"features", beware.

A common "fix" proposed is to simply not trust mail from someone you
don't know.  But the problem is that such "worm" mail (it is really
more a worm than a virus) *does* come from someone you know.  Since it
is "you" (or commands from your terminal) causing letters to be
propogated, the mail looks like it is coming from you.  The IBM
"Christmas Tree Virus" used the victim's personal mail list for more
targets with a resutling high probability of mail coming from someone
whom the next user "trusted".

This is the same problem as with a biological epidemic, of course,
until the public becomes aware of it.

Subject:  nVIR virus and suggested remedies (Mac)

We here at calm, quiet, Quakerly Haverford have just discovered the
nVIR virus on almost all of our Macs.  As I am relatively new to this
list (and incredibly anxious to restore calm and quiet to our campus),
I was wondering if any of you might be able to offer any suggestions
as to the best strategy for dealing with the nVIR strain.  We have so
far used Interferon 3.0 to identify affected files, although
Interferon seems to choke on AppleShare volumes (we have two
AppleShare servers which were hit pretty badly).  Would Vaccine or Rx
work any better?  Does anyone have any general info. they could share
regarding the general characteristics of the nVIR virus?  It would be
nice to know the nature of the beast with which we deal.  I would also
be VERY interested in how other colleges/universities dealt with the
cleaning of students' disks so as to prevent reinfection of the public
machines.  Thanks in advance for any help you might be able to
provide.
