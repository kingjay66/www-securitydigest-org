PAKISTANI VIRUS INVADES INDIAN NEIGHBOR
 
'C-Bran', a computer virus of Pakistani origin, has hit personal computers
throughout India in what is thought to be the first epidemic of its kind
in the nation.  The incident highlights India's extensive trade in pirated
software and copied floppy disks.
 
In just four weeks, "C-BRAN" showed up in comptuer schools and a private
company in Bangalore and in somee 20 companies in Bombay,
including an international bank.  The virus was also reported
from Madras, Kanpur and Vijayawada, a small town where
750 of 1000 floppy disks used by a private company were
found to be infected.  Scientists at the Delhi University
Computer Centre said their machines were invaded by the
'ashar' variant of the virus.
 
Dr. N.C. Kalra of the Indian Institute of Technology
in Delhi, who detected 'ashar' in the institute's computer,
blamed the epidemic on pirated software.  No virus has yet shown
up in computers linked by electronic networks but government agencies
have been alerted.  India's NICNET links the Cybercomputer
mainframe computer in the Planniing Commission with portable
computers in district headquarters while another network,
ERNET links the computer centres of eight educational enstitutions.
The six major commercial comptuer networks all claim to have
strengthened their security system following the epidemic.

be sufficient to move your discussion with Mr. Morey elsewhere?

I was off the net for a month and didn't see your list. would you
please e-mail me a copy?
 
I am interested in developing a taxonomy of computer software with
special interest in "biological" software, i.e., software capable of
replicating itself, which includes viruses, worms, phages and others,
and a secondary interest in penetration algorithms.  Would you please
favor me with any thoughts you have on this topic?

I have recently (re)joined the net (darned job.  Takes me away from
the fun things in life.) and have just found the comp.virus newsgroup.
Could someone please send me (all?) the back issues of VIRUS-L digest
so I can catch up with what's going on?

HORSEFEATHERS!  Perhaps you mean to say no software publisher is
publically known to have intentionally released a virus into
circulation.  By definition, you, nor we, do not know of "secret" or
"undiscovered" releases of viruses by software publishers.  there may
be some or there may be none.  But YOU DON'T KNOW!
 
>nor is it likely that any would do so, as it would
>be contrary to their interests.
 
HORSEFEATHERS!  Several scenarios have been proposed in which a
software publisher would gain some advantage from releasing a virus,
provided only that knowledge of such behavior could be kept secret.
Anne Cole provides one such in her article cited above.  The undetected
release of a virus in a purportedly stolen copy of proprietary software
could easily deter people who might otherwise be just a little casual
in their software acquisition policies.  A clear benefit to software
publishers.
 
>Viruses threaten the entire software industry
 
Not clear.  And certainly not proven.
 
>and expose the releasing party to an enormous legal liability.
 
If caught and if sufficient evidence can be collected to prove such in
a court of law.

Mr. Meyer did not offer any evidence.  I wish he would!  Or anyone
else out there who has some EVIDENCE.  Not just a story without
substantiation.
 
>The idea of releasing viruses to protect intellectual property rights

Let's compare apples to apples, please.  The accurate comparison is
the bombing of a printing shop which makes copies of a book without
paying the author's royalties.  A clear benefit to the author.

Subject: A Taxonomy of "Electronic Biologicals" (Was: Net Hormones)
 
In article <0001.8906122012.AA00724@ubu.CC.Lehigh.EDU>
Dr. David S. Stodolsky <@uunet.uu.net:stodol@diku.dk>
responds to earlier discussions and questions raised by
Chris McDonald <cmcdonal@wsmr-emh10.army.mil> regarding Dr.
Stodolsky's paper "Net hormones: Part 1 - Infection control assuming
cooperation among computers "
 
In an article that I haven't seen yet, D. Platt discusses biological
analogues for software.  [ Platt, D. (1989b, May 10). Biological
analogues. Virus-L Digest , 2(112).]
 
At the 10th National Computer Security Conference (Oct 1987) a paper
was given on the Taxonomy of Computer Viruses.  In my opinion, that
paper should be expanded upon, developed into a comprehensive taxonomy
of computer software, and should be made available to every university
library and computer scientist.  My attention has been diverted to
other endeavors in the intervening year and a half, so possibly such
work is on-going without my being aware of it.  If so, would this
group kindly direct me.  If not, could we start such a compilation and
classification?
