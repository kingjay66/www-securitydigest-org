Several bulleting boards in the Washington DC metropolitan area have
had a "Stuffit 2.0" uploaded to them.  This does not appear to be a
legitimate update to Ray Lau's Stuffit utility.  A cursory check of
the "Get Info" box will show some rather funky information in the
application name and version fields.
 
We (myself and the Sysops of the boards that have had this uploaded
to) have no evidence that this utility does anything harmful, but then
again, why would someone upload a bogus version of Stuffit.

Thanks for making the report available, Ken!  The full reference
is something like
 
Coping With Computer Viruses and Related Problems
  by Steve R. White, David M. Chess and Chengi Jimmy Kuo
     IBM T.J. Watson Research Center
     IBM Los Angeles Scientific Center
     Research Report (RC 14405) January 30, 1989
 
(Three authors!)
 
Abstract
          We discuss computer viruses and related problems.  Our
          intent is to help both executive and technical managers
          understand the problems that viruses pose, and to suggest
          practical steps they can take to help protect their
          computing systems.
 
It's also available (in ARC format) as VIRUSD.ARC in LIB 0 (at
the moment) of the IBMSYS forum on CompuServ.
 
While it's written for a management-type audience, general users
should find it interesting as well.   Except for one appendix
(which describes some places in PC-DOS that should be watched for
viruses), it's very non-specific, and applies to any sort of
computer.

     Is anybody familiar with the Mac desk accessory VirusDetective?
How reliable is it?  Does it merely identify infected files or will it
also remove viruses from files?
 
     If anybody has experience with it, I would like to hear from you.
Thanks.
