VIRUS-L Digest   Thursday, 24 Aug 1989    Volume 2 : Issue 180
 
VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: Virus Naming
 
Every new virus report these days seems to lead to a debate about a
proper name for the beasts.  May I suggest that this matter be
settled, once and for all, by adopting long-established traditions
used in a variety of sciences, ranging from astronomy to biology to
medicine: The discoverer of, or the first person to describe, a
planet/microbe/disease has an essentially absolute right to choose a
name for it.  A poorly-chosen name for something that gets discussed
extensively will sometimes fall by the wayside, but that's the
exception.
 
The closest match from the traditional sciences is clearly with
medicine.  The person who gets to choose the name is the person who
publishes the first article which describes the disease in some
detail.  The tone of such articles is quite similar to the tone of the
recent analyses of viral code.  While the discover can choose any name
he likes, traditionally the names chosen reflect either some obvious
and distinctive mark or symptom of the disease (AIDS - Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome), or the place where it was first noted (Lyme
Disease).  When the discoverer doesn't choose a name, the disease
often gets named after him (Wernickie's Aphasia).
 
Other fields of science have established their own traditions (names
of Roman gods for planets; Latin descriptive terms for species -
though this gets tempered by humor).  Biological viruses have pretty
arbitrary names: One large class, the Coxsackie viruses, are named
after a town in upstate New York where the first member of the class
was isolated; another, the Herpes viruses, I believe have a name
derived from Greek via a particular disease caused by one of them.
Others have names like "T4 phage".

Subject: Destructive virus...
 
Does anyone on the list have some information about an alleged virus that
caused monitors on either older PCs, Ataris, or Amigas (I forgot which plat-
form was susceptible) to self-destruct?  We were discussing this nasty over
lunch the other day and are interested in finding out more.

Subject: Locking Macintosh disks
 
i bet this question has been asked before, so please excuse me, but
is it possible for a virus to infect a locked macintosh disk?

Subject: Re: Swap Virus Name (PC)
 
In deference/support to Y. Radai, while it is important to try and be consisten
t
about the naming convention we use for viruses and so forth, it is not "life-
threatening".  As the "Swap" virus does not fit into the current naming
convention well, and "Swap" is not a "libelous" name (as opposed to calling it
the "Jim and Tammy Bakker" virus for example), then why *shouldn't* we call it
the "Swap" virus.
