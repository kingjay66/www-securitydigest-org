          Sabotaged Program Reactions - An Editorial Review
          by Frank Starr

     The continuing threat of virus and Trojan Horse programs - which
I prefer to call sabotaged programs, has begun to spark some reaction
from the upper levels of the Department of Defense. Concurrent with
the discovery of the so-called "Columbus Day Time Bomb", previously
known as the Datacrime Virus, has come a series of directives which
may serve to eliminate the use of all forms of shareware by D.O.D.
personnel on D.O.D.  microcomputers.
     Air Force users first received word of the Columbus virus from a
message published by the USAF Office of Special Investigation,
republished and mass mailed through MILNET/DDN, the D.O.D. e-mail
system. Two suspected sources have been listed - a European extremist
group in the spiritual sway of Bader Meinhoff, and a Norwegian group
displeased with celebrations honoring Columbus, while ignoring Norse
discoveries preceeding those of European explorers.
     Later communiques identified the virus as the Datacrime variety,
capable of trashing the FAT area of a hard drive. From the first
message to all others received to date, a prevailing directive has
been to cease using all software downloaded from private bulletin
boards. Various interpretations have gone so far as to conclude that
only vendor supplied software should be used, to the absolute
exclusion of everything else, whether shareware available for purchase
after an initial test period, or freeware for which no fee or donation
is ever asked.
     All of this confusion promises to cause a lot of D.O.D. micro
users to cut themselves off from anything except commercial software,
purchased through government contracting channels. This in spite of
the fact that there have even been reports about commercial software
occasionally being sabotaged by temporary employees (as reported in an
issue of Government Computer news about a year ago. Sorry, specific
issue forgotten). There are a number of micro bulletin boards in
D.O.D., some of which offer shareware software for evaluation to
potential customers. Some of the SYSOPs of these systems forsee a call
to close down operations, based on reactions to sabotaged software
threats, and rough drafts of official regulations to control software
on D.O.D. micros (see the September/October C2MUG bulletin, page 5).
     Although there are some advisories for users to back up all
software on D.O.D. micros, more attention seems to be going towards
the elimination of all non-contract software on D.O.D. micros. Since
sabotaged programs are more often reported in connection with
softwaree downloaded from public RBBS systems, this game plan can be
understood, if not readily supported.  However, with micro user
education still a lower priority object in many areas, and software
backup not a widespread practice, it seems that, especially with
funding cuts a now and future reality, more attention would better be
given to how to defend against sabotaged programs, and perhaps the
avoidance of all forms of shareware could be reevaluated.

Frank,

I just read and reread your editorial.  I fear that possibly many
people will misread it, overlooking certain key words and phrases,
such as "may" in "may serve to eliminate," "various interpretations,"
"foresee," "seems" in "more attention seems to be," etc.

The actual point of your editorial, with which I agree, is in your
last sentence, which should have been a paragraph by itself (starting
with the word, "However," and broken into several sentences:

    Micro user education is still a low priority activity in many
    areas, and software backup not a widespread practice.  With
    funding cuts a now and future reality, more attention should be
    given to defending against sabotaged programs.  Then, perhaps, the
    trend toward avoiding all forms of shareware could be reevaluated.

Subject: The invincible virus (Ghost virus) (Atari ST)

First I would like to make my excuse for not giving enough information
in my last (and first in my career) message to usenet.

I asked some information about the Ghost Virus on the Atari ST, well I
forgot to mention the computersystem and the kind of information I
requested Well here goes all or nothing :

Since a few months I'm being bugged by a virus that inverses the
mousepointer.  So after I figured that it could be a virus, I pulled
out my trusty Viruskiller (VDU - Virus Destruction Utility V1.4) and
became aware of this "Ghost Virus".  After wiping the virus from all
my disks I thought I would be save, but none could be more true. This
virus returned every time.

Maybe it is a link-virus that somehow manages to copy itself into the
bootsector so that it can begin it's faul work again. But the VDU
doesn't reconize any link-virus on any of my disks, so my question to
all of you is :

Is there some way to get rid of this virus without formatting all my
disks ??

I'm afraid it won't help. You should send some mail to John Norstad
*immediately* and let him know about it. He may request a copy of your
infected files. His net address is in the Disinfectant documentation.

Actually, you should check it out with ResEdit and see what resource
they get added to. Ditto for the System; look for INIT resources.
There are a few that are supposed to be there, but the virus may add
new ones.
 (more details omitted)

This sounds very much like a new virus. Have you Vaccine or GateKeeper
installed? Either should keep infections from spreading, unless the
virus is doing its own disk I/O at the driver level (very dangerous
and could lead to screwed-up disks).

Things to try:
  - Write-protect a known-clean version of MacWrite and try running
    it on the infected system.
  - Change another application's signature (type/creator) to MacWrite's
    and see if the virus tries to infect it.
  - Name MacWrite something else and see if it is attacked.
  - Look at the system healp with Macsbug and and try to identify all
    of the resources loaded into it. This may help in tracking down
    the infection mechanism.

I'd appreciate hearing further details; post them to me personally
if you'd like.

It does annoying things (beeps or says "Don't Panic"). Since it also grabs
space in the system heap AND installs a VBL task, it can cause memory
problems and timing problems, causing printing failures and crashes.

Its presence is always a concern. Think of it as a public health problem.
Your cluster, if left infected, would be a reservoir of infection and a
potential source of spread, no matter how much time other clusters spent
cleaning themselves up.

Get Vaccine or GateKeeper installed on those Macs. Now. You must have
either not had them installed, or someone has been turning them off. If
you suspect that someone is deliberately infecting the cluster, you might
want to set up a virus-scanning station that all disks must be passed
through before they are used on your cluster. The Disinfectant
documentation will tell you how to do this.

Try using GateKeeper and shutting down ALL accesses to files. See if
that will show you what's being copied into the files. It should be
in the GateKeeper Log.

CTDONATH@SUNRISE.BITNET asks:

...where can we get the most recent versions {of anti-viral software} ?

On BITNet, the LISTSERV at our node (SCFVM) has a virus-removal package
consisting of Disinfectant, Virus Rx, Vaccine, GateKeeper, and some
other files. You can subscribe to this package and receive updates
automatically by obtaining a LISTSERV password and AFD ADDing the
package.

On Internet, sumex-aim.stanford.edu has anti-virals in the
/info-mac/virus directory. apple.apple.com in the pub/dts/mac/tools
directory has the newset version of Virus Rx.

Hope this helps.

Subject: datacrime II antidote (PC)

On or after the 12th of October, an undetermined number of computer
'viruses' are scheduled to start erasing the data of their
unsuspecting hosts. One virus in particular, known as 'DATACRIME II',
is an especially nasty specimen, as it not only spreads very rapidly,
but also formats the hard disk of any computer it infests, permanently
destroying all of the contents.

DATACRIME was first detected in the Netherlands, and the leading
computer publication of that country, PERSONAL COMPUTER MAGAZINE,
commissioned computer expert Rikki Cate to write an 'antidote' program
for its readers.  Cate, an American who lives in the Netherlands, is a
programmer specialized in this kind of work.

Cate's Cure was an overnight sensation.  Featured on radio, television
and in Holland's leading newspapers, thousands of copies were
distributed within the first few days and it has already inspired a
number of hastily composed imitations. Even the Dutch police have
begun distributing a version of their own.  Cate's Cure, however,
claims superiority to all of these.  It is much faster, it actually
removes the virus, it repairs damaged programs, it automatically
searches all the directories on the hard disk, and it provides
permanent protection against formating of the hard disk or new
infections by the virus.  None of the other programs released have any
of these features.  This is believed to have been confirmed in an
independent test carried out by the Dutch Railways.

In view of the huge demand and the clear anxiety indicated by that,
Cate has decided, with the approval of PCM, to make the antidote more
widely available at a cost of $10 per disk.  Additional information
can be obtained from her directly by calling 31-20-981963 in
Amsterdam.  Fax: 31-20-763706, telex 12969 neabs nl, Fido 2:280/2,
electronic mail 31-20-717666, all marked to her attention.

Pond, for electronic distribution?]

Subject: OGRE virus in Arizona (PC)

Original_From: Paul Balyoz

A new, extremely nasty virus has been discovered on some IBM PCs in
the state of Arizona.  This virus, known as OGRE, has been found on
some disks in Flagstaff and nearby areas.  This is the first
recognition of said virus that has come to my attention.  This memo
gives a description of the virus and possible ways of recognizing and
removing it.

DESCRIPTION

The OGRE virus tries to infect any disks it sees that haven't yet been
infected with itself.  It counts the number of disks it has infected
as it goes along.  It does no harm until after it has infected a
certain number of disks.  After that point it will display a message
on the screen at boot time identifying itself as the COMPUTER OGRE
dated April 1, and telling you to leave your machine alone as it
begins "stomping" blocks on the disk randomly, by writing blocks full
of one character all over the disk.  This holds true for both floppy
disks and hard disks.  The damage done in this manner is virtually
irrepairable.  Once this happens the hard disk usually needs to be
reformatted (which effectively erases everything on on disk).  If
backup copies of the files from that disk were made, it can be
restored back onto the reformatted disk, and all is well again (until
the next time).

If you see this message appear on your screen, ignore the warning and
TURN YOUR COMPUTER OFF IMMEDIATELY!  The quicker you turn it off, the
less damage it will have done.  The first blocks it destroys are the
boot blocks and file and directory information; files go after that.
If stopped in time, the files on the disk may be retrieved using
various disk utility programs.

TECHNICAL DETAILS

The OGRE virus spreads by writing copies of itself onto 3 unused
blocks on the disk.  It then marks those blocks as being "bad," so
that normal disk usage won't ever choose those blocks for storing
ordinary data.  Thus the virus can stay on the disk without being
bothered.  The important step is when it modifies the boot blocks of
the disk so that next time the disk is booted, the special code on
those three blocks is executed, and the virus can try to infect new
disks.  Thus, every time the disk is booted thereafter, the OGRE code
is executed, and can do what it has been programmed to do.

Because the OGRE virus operates at such a "low level," none of the
existing virus detection/elimination programs currently in existence
for the IBM PC will work.  Note that OGRE doesn't create or modify any
of the files on the disk at the time of infection, nor does it effect
the FAT in any way.  Thus it is virtually undetectable by present
means, until special programs are developed to detect and remove it.

RECOGNIZING THE VIRUS

If you have a "disk zap" or "sector edit" type of program, you can use
that to see if the OGRE virus has infected each of your disks.  You'll
want to search the disk for the string "OGRE" (those four upper-case
ascii characters) or "COMPUTER OGRE" to be sure.  You will know by the
surrounding text if each occurrance of the string is truly the virus
or not.

The software package "Norton Utilities" has a program that can do this
sort of disk-searching function.  The most important place to look are
the boot- blocks on the disk.  If the string exists in that area, your
disk is probably infected.

Note: It is possible for normal information on the disk to spell out
the string "OGRE" just by chance.  As I understand it, that string
being found in the boot-blocks nearly guarantees infection.  The text
before and after the string must be viewed to be sure.  There is a
date of April 1, and a copy- right notice, as well as the English text
that it can display.  You will know from the context whether your disk
is infected or not.

CLEANING AN INFECTED DISK

File copying will "clean" an infected disk.

Because OGRE doesn't effect any files, per se, a good method for
cleaning up an infected disk that hasn't been "stomped on" yet would
be to copy all of the files off that disk onto a freshly formatted
one.  Of course you'll want to be sure that the virus isn't running
while you do this, or it will quickly infect the new disk as well!
Boot your computer from an original system disk that was distributed
with your computer.  Make sure it is write-protected before booting.
If this disk has never been un-write-protected, then it can't ever
have been infected.  Then go ahead and format the new disk, and copy
your files to it.

The infected disk you just copied all the files off of can now be
formatted to clean it up, and files copied back onto it again.

FUTURE VIRUS DETECTION IDEA

Checksum the boot blocks.

A program should be written to run a set of checksums on the boot
blocks of your disk, and remember the number somewhere.  When run
thereafter it can recompute the checksum and compare it to the one
recorded previously.  If the two checksums do not match exactly then
the boot blocks have been modified, which is not a normal thing to
have happen.  The program can then notify the user that,

     "The boot blocks on this disk have changed; you may have a virus."

If this program were written and launched from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file
on all bootable disks, then the user would know immediately if they
were infected.  Of course, the OGRE virus would have already been
executed once by then, since the disk was booted before the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file was read, so it may have infected another disk; but
it won't have gone on the rampage yet.  The user would thus have
pre-knowledge of the infection, and can combat it before any damage is
done.

DISCLAIMER

I have not personally seen the virus nor any disks damaged by it.

SOURCE INFORMATION

This new virus was discovered by members of the staff at Computer
Solutions here in Flagstaff Arizona.  They are working on
disassembling the virus and will hopefully come up with a virus
removal procedure or program.  The current theory is that it
originated somewhere in the Phoenix area, but nothing is sure yet.
Computer Solutions is trying to contact as many people as they can to
warn them about this new problem.  You are encouraged to make copies
of this memo in any form and distribute them to anyone who might need
to know this information.

You can contact Computer Solutions at 602-774-1272 during the day.
