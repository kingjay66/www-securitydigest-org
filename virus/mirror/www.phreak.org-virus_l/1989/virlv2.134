Subject: re: vendors releasing viruses
 
As more bogus evidence that vendors would release viral code, Roman
Olynyk cited an ominous warning that appeared in Microsoft Word for
the Mac, version 1.00.
 
This is bogus evidence for at least two reasons.  First, the warning
portended file destruction, but not viral release.  Second, if I
remember my facts correctly, that was a totally misleading and
unauthorized warning written into the application by a junior
programmer.  No destructive code was in the program.  When its
presence became known to the company, I believe the employee was
terminated.
 
Again, let me reiterate.  Software developers are as aggrieved by
viral infections as anyone.  We use more software than you do.  It
would be contrary to both our immediate and long-term interests to
poison our own products.
 
We're on the same side as you, folks.  We want this stuff to work.

Subject: Virus Disinfectors (PC)
 
Rob Nauta and others have asked about specific disinfectors for IBM PC
viruses.  HomeBase maintains disinfectors for virtually all PC viruses.
The MDISK programs remove any boot sector or partition table virus; there
are disinfectors for 1701, 1704, Lehigh, Jerusalem-A, Jerusalem-B, Pakistani
volume label restore and many others.  The MDISK programs are part of the
McAfee utilities and are shareware, many of the others are also shareware.
If anyone is interested in these programs call HomeBase at 408 988 4004.
 
Also, there is now a very good presentation graphics package on viruses
that runs on any VGA system that has just been made public domain.  It's
great for talks, seminars, presentations etc. on viruses.  Also available
on HomeBase.

Subject: Naming confusion
 
Just as a thought, it shouldn't be too difficult to arrange something
based on a date/time stamp placed upon any *new* virus mentioned on
virus-l.  This would naturally be based purely on the judgement, spare
time and goodwill of the list moderator :-)...It could be as simple as
a text file (document) listing virus-l reference name and known
aliases (as they appear).
 
If the aforementioned spare time (!) and good will stretch far enough,
another useful add-on would be a cumulative list of virus-l references
kept with each virus name entry.  This is of course quite audacious to
propose, but I think it would enhance the value of the list (and
particularly the archives) considerably.  It seems like a sufficiently
worth-while effort that the member- ship might propose indexing the
archives to their various employers as a project worthy of
institutional support.  (Money, labor, whatever.)  I will.

Does anybody know how and where I can get a copy of SUG.ARC
trojan described by Bob Stratton in VIRUS-L 133 ?

Can anyone verify/refute this?  Has this been seen elsewhere (perhaps
his copy is infected by an ordinary virus)?  Can anyone at Microsoft
make *objective* comments.  How about anyone with an original,
unaltered copy of MS-Word 1.0?  Please examine the disk & report the
location of the string, so others can find it.  I hope this is just a
rumor.

The security mailing list has a procedure for emergency
notification of viruses and other problems.  I have appended
membership directions.

UNIX SECURITY MAILING LIST
 
The unix security mailing list exists for these reasons:
 
1. To notify system administrators and other appropriate people of
   serious security dangers BEFORE they become common knowledge.
 
2. Provide security enhancement information.
 
Most unix security mailing list material has been explanations of, and
fixes for, specific security "holes".  I DO NOT believe in security
through obscurity, but I certainly don't spread "cracking" methods to
the world at large as soon as they become known.  The unix security
list is, in my opinion, an excellent compromise between the two ideas.
It is not intended for the discussion of theoretical security
techniques or "Should we thank Mr. Morris?" types of subjects, there
is no need for secrecy regarding such matters, and appropriate usenet
news groups already exist that serve those purposes.  It is, however,
appropriate to post security checkup programs and scripts, and
specific security enhancement methods to this list in addition to the
proper news groups.  I assume that the readers of this list took a
special effort to join, and would appreciate appropriate material
being sent via email so that they don't have to sort through many news
groups to "catch" everything.
 
zardoz is located in Southern California, has 45 uucp links including
uunet, and is in the process of becoming part of the Internet.
Reliable delivery is available to any bang path or internet address.
Each mailing list destination can choose to receive either
automatically "reflected" postings of all received material, or
moderated digests that are sent out about once a week.  There is a
seperate posting address for emergencies that reflects the received
material to the entire mailing list without any intervention on my
part.
 
I typically require that destinations have an interest in unix site
security, or are involved in adding security enhancement software to
unix, but I am flexible.  To apply for membership, send email from one
of the following or send email requesting that I contact one of the
following (please arrange the former, it saves me time):
 
1.      For uucp sites with a uucp map entry, the listed email contact,
        map entry writer, or root.
2.      For internet sites, the NIC "WHOIS" listed site contact, or root.
 
Please include the following:
 
1.      The uucp map entry and map name to find it in, or the WHOIS
        response from the NIC and the request handle.
2.      The actual email destination you want material sent to.  It
        can be a person or alias, but must be on the same machine
        that you use as a reference, or in a sub-domain of said machine.
3.      Whether you want immediate reflected postings, or the weekly
        moderated digests.
4.      The email address and voice phone number of the administrative
        contact if different from the above.
5.      The organization name, address, and voice phone number if not
        listed already.
 
Please don't do any of the following:
 
1.      send email from root on machine_17.basement.podunk_U.edu and
        expect that to be sufficient for membership.  With
        workstations being so prevalent, and being so EASY to "crack",
        root doesn't mean much these days.
2.      send email from root on the uucp map entry listed site
        toy-of-son and expect that to be sufficient.  If you would prefer
        material sent to a home machine, verify your credentials through
        one of the previously mentioned methods.
3.      send mail from a network that I don't have any way to verify,
        such as bitnet or others.  I can verify uucp and internet sites.
        Send me some way to verify your credentials if you can't use
        an appropriate listed uucp or internet site.
4.      send me mail saying I can verify your identity and credentials
        by telephoning a long distance number.  I will continue to donate
        the extra computer capacity required for sending and archiving
        this list, and I will continue to spend the money on the extra
        uucp/internet communication costs that this list requires, but I
        draw the line at spending money on voice long distance phone calls.
5.      send me an application request that involves a lot of time and
        special procedures for verification.  Please try to make my
        processing of your application an easy matter.

Try BYTE,June 1989.There is a good article about Viruses in general with
special focus on three of them:The Israeli Virus,The Brain Virus and some
other one who's name I can't remmember right now.
