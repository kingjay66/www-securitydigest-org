VIRUS-L Digest   Friday,  1 Dec 1989    Volume 2 : Issue 251

VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

In addition to the files mentioned here, I'm trying to see that
all the IBMPC archive sites are "in sync" with one another.  This
generally means that older files will be sent to sites, but there
are some goodies out there.  After a while, check up on your favorite
archive site.

Short listings...

ckot095.zip     Shell program to use with scanv and archived files
dirtyd9b.zip    Version 9B of the Dirty Dozen list of Trojan programs
fsp_17.arc      FluShot+ v1.7, checksums and resident protection
nobrains.arc    Docs and progs for dealing with Brain virus
scanrs49.zip    Resident program to scan executables for viruses
scanv49.zip     Program to scan files/dirs/disks for viruses
shez491.zip     Shell program to use with scanv and archived files
virstop.zip     Resident program to scan executables for viruses


Long listings...

ckot095.zip
	Update to the shell program for manipulating archives.  (ARC,
	ZOO, PAK, ZIP, LZH, etc.)  Compatible with scanv.  Should fix
	previous problem with deleting files.  DOS4.01 users be cautious.
	This program is meant for command line and batch usage.
dirtyd9b.zip
	Excellent list of Trojan Horse and pirated programs.  As
	for the virus listings, they seem to be in a *very* preliminary
	stage of development.  Two of the "virus" listings include:
	|	COMMAND.COM
	|		This is a traditional Virus.  Originating
	|		in colleges and universities across the
	|		nation, and in particular at Lehigh
	|		College, this virus will embed itself in
	|		COMMAND.COM.
	Remember, command.com is a virus which infects itself, in a
	traditional sort of way. :-)
	|	UNIX
	|		Version 4.3 of UC Berkley's UNIX is
	|		apparently an INTERNET virus which
	|		travels by mail packet.  Beware.
	Got that?  Everybody delete that nasty Unix from your systems. :-)
fsp_17.arc
	Version 1.7 of FluShot+.  Checksums files, and provides runtime
	protection from malicious programs.  One of the many documentation
	files provided is 40 pages long.  There's lots of information
	for beginning to intermediate DOS users.  Apparently this
	announcement slipped through the cracks earlier.
nobrains.arc
	I took a couple existing programs to eradicate the Brain virus,
	found the source code for them and packed it all up together with a
	bunch of informational text.  Starter kit for the brain infected.
scanrs49.zip
	Yet another update.  Includes table of viruses and characteristics,
	plus validation program.
scanv49.zip
	Yet another update.  Includes table of viruses and characteristics,
	plus validation program.
shez491.zip
	Update to the shell program for manipulating archives.  (ARC,
	ZOO, PAK, ZIP, LZH, etc.)  Compatible with scanv.  This program
	is meant for interactive browsing.
virstop.zip
	A program that does essentially what scanres does, but according
	to the author, it's cheaper and it's faster.

# Introduction to the Anti-viral archives...
# Listing of 29 November 1989

This posting is the introduction to the "official" anti-viral archives
of virus-l/comp.virus.  With the generous cooperation of many sites
throughout the world, we are attempting to make available to all
the most recent news and programs for dealing with the virus problem.
Currently we have sites for Amiga, Apple II, Atari ST, IBMPC, Macintosh
and Unix computers, as well as sites carrying research papers and
reports of general interest.

If you have general questions regarding the archives, you can send
them to this list or to me.  I'll do my best to help.  If you have a
submission for the archives, you can send it to me or to one of the
persons in charge of the relevant sites.

If you have any corrections to the lists, please let me know.

Jim

==== cruft for the lawyers ====

The files contained on the participating archive sites are provided freely
on an as-is basis.

To the best of our knowledge, all files contained in the archives are either
Public Domain, Freely Redistributable, or Shareware.  If you know of one
that is not, please drop us a line and let us know.  Reports of corrupt
files are also welcome.

PLEASE NOTE
The Managers of these systems, and the Maintainers of the archives, CAN NOT
and DO NOT guarantee any of these applications for any purpose.  All possible
precautions have been taken to assure you of a safe repository of useful
tools.  Unfortunately, in this day and age nothing is certain.  It is awful
that these people have to worry about legalities when they are only trying
to provide a free and useful service.

Sigh.

Subject: Virus Demos? (PC)

 I have seen conflicting descriptions of what the Marijuana virus
displays on the screen.  Not being afflicted myself, touch wood, I
don't know whom to believe.  Three sources I have seen claim that the
"Legalise marijuana" message is seen, and ALan Solomon recently said
at a Melbourne seminar that this message is embedded in the virus
code, and is not seen on the screen.  This anomaly is a minor issue,
but it set me wondering how does the average user (beginner) know when
a virus has struck her/him?  There is no shortage of virusbusters able
and willing to help such people for a fee.

It would be a good idea for someone who has samples of all known
viruses to create a "virus demo" program using something like Dan
Bricklin's Demo for the purpose.  I haven't seen this program (DB's
D), so I don't know if it could mimic all viruses.  It would also not
work with a virus that does its damage in the background and leaves no
screen message.

Our user group would like to create a library of viruses for testing
new antivirus programs, but I appreciate that no self-respecting
custodian of samples would turn over copies to us without some
cast-iron guarantees of keeping the samples under lock and key.  Hence
the suggestion for a harmless virus demo for known culprits that leave
a screen symptom.

At my university, we have a several computers infected with the Ping
Pong virus version B.  What is the easiest way to remove the virus?
Let me rephrase that.  How can I remove the virus without erasing the
data?

 "A pig ate his fill of acorns under an oak tree and then started to root
   around the tree.  A crow remarked, `You should not do this.  If you lay bare
   the roots, the tree will wither and die.' `Let it die,' said the pig.  `Who
   cares so long as there are acorns?'"

I just downloaded the latest version of SCAN, and in reading the
documentation file, I noticed that SCAN now uses SELF TEST?

At least that is what it says in the opening paragraph of the
latest documentation file. Did I read it wrong? (It was late at
night!)

After running VIRSCAN on a Dos 3.1 floppy disk, it reported that the
boot sector was infected with the Yale Virus.  When we booted a pc
with this disk the following message was displayed: "This is a message
from the U.S. Space Fedearation".  Is this message part of the virus
or was it just placed by a user?  WE ARE REQUESTING ANY INFO YOU HAVE
ABOUT THE YALE VIRUS!  Thanks in advance!

Subject: MDISK - Boot virus removing program (PC)

Has anyone used this package? I have tried it to remove Stoned virus
from the partition table of a hard disk and it seems to work ok.
However when I tried to remove the same virus from the boot sector of
a floppy I keep getting an Abort error message - not able to continue
(from the program).  As the documentation on this package is rather
scarce I would appreciate any advice or comment( I have followed the
procedure as given in the documentation several times to make sure I
did it right!).  Our DOS is version 3.3 and I used the MD33 F command
to disenfect floppies.

As luck would have it, just hours after I posted my request for a
harmless virus simulation suite, someone gave me a suite of programs
written by Joe Hirst in MS-DOS format archived as VIRSIMUL.ARC.  The
files have a date of 8 Sep 89, so I may not have the latest set.  The
suite contains the more common viruses (simulated) that have visual
effects.

Subject: Virus attack [AMIGA]

The other day someone brought the Byte Bandit virus into our lab.  A
user came in to print from the Amiga using Scribble!.  He booted from
his Workbench and proceeded to have several problems printing to the
Apple Imagewriter II.  After he left I re-booted with my Workbench
which runs VirusX3.20 as part of its startup-sequence.  To my surprise
VirusX reported that the Byte Bandit virus was in memory, and had
infected the disk in df2:!  Removing the virus with VirusX was simple
enough.

My question is, could this virus (Byte Bandit) have been responsible
for the problems we had printing?  We had the right printer driver,
and the preferences settings all seemed OK but it just would not print
properly.  It changed type style randomly, stopped printing half way
through a job, and wouldn't abide to margin settings.  I've never had
this type of problem before with Scribble!, which leads me to believe
that the virus might have had something to do with it. I know that
virii on the Mac tend to affect printing.  Has anyone else experienced
this situation?
