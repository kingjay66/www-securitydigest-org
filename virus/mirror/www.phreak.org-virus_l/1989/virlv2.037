What version of Interferon are you using, and in what application did
you find a "Sneak" virus? You have a couple of possibilites here. One,
you really do have a virus, but Interferon is too old to know it (Hpat
or INIT 29). Two, you have System 6.0.2 and an Interferon previous to
3.0 (that will show the new LaserPrep and LaserWriter drivers as in-
fected), or you have TOPS (whose internal structure LOOKS like a Sneak
virus, but isn't).

     In Bill Machrone's column in the latest PC Magazine (Feb. 28,
1989) he mentions that he has seen a book which shows interested
parties not how to protect oneself against viruses and the like, but
how to WRITE the suckers.  The author has thoughtfully provided
listings in 370 Assembler, EXEC (the Christmas EXEC!), PC Assembler,
Pascal, BASIC, etc. etc.. Monitor and floppy drive destroying tips
also seem to be included, as well as advice on how to hide your
handiwork.  Machrone has not offered the title or the author's name,
but if the book really exists and if its techniques really work I'm
sure we will hear a lot more of it real soon now.

Great.  An "Anarchist's Cookbook" for computers.  I think the concept
is pretty reprehensible.

     As a somewhat new member of this list, I was wondering if anyone
has compiled a list of major viruses, and their symptoms.  Also, if
such a list already exists, where would I find it?  It would make
these messages much easier to understand....
