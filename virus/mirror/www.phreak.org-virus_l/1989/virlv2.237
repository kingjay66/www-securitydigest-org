VIRUS-L Digest   Thursday,  9 Nov 1989    Volume 2 : Issue 237

VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

I don't agree with you on any of these points, Terry. Say, on the
Macintosh all calls to ROM are done through trap vectors in RAM. These
trap vectors are patched by the system file (to fix bugs), by some
programs and by all anti-virus tools. However, it doesn't take a
genius to figure out that one could restore the trap vector to it's
original value and thereby bypassing the "safe" system.  (Alright, we
don't have the bug fixes installed, but it's easy to mimic what is
done by the system file. (For instance by simply calling the very same
routine.)). A patch like this wouldn't occupy much space and is quite
simple to write.

I'd guess I could write a virus using the above technique in a day or
two, which would be undetectable by all existing anti-virus tools, and
along with me so could lots of other people. However some of us are
busy making money, as you said, and we who are just working (:-))
probably have some sense of moral, stopping us from bringing total
chaos to the computer society.

I just saw a note on comp.risks about viruses in China.

The "Small Ball" is probably just a variant of Ping-Pong, "Marijuana" is
the same virus as "Stoned" or "New Zealand", but what is "Shell" ??

Anybody got an idea ?

In Virus-L V2 #235, "Gregory E. Gilbert" <C0195@UNIVSCVM.BITNET> asks
about the "Macwight" (sic) virus.

Recently, there was a report of a virus that attacked MacWrite from
the University of Rochester.  Since the initial report however,
nothing has been heard from them.

Subject: Jerusalem virus (PC)

The Jerusalem virus has turned up here at Southern Illinois
University, also.  From dissecting a copy of the virus, and an article
in the February 15, 1989 edition of Datamation ("The Virus Cure", by
John McAffe, Pp. 29-40), the Jerusalem virus (called the Israeli virus
in the Datamation article) does the following:

When an infected .EXE or .COM file is loaded and run, the Jerusalem
virus checks to see if it is already resident in the computer.  If
not, it sets itself up to intercept DOS INT 21h, then proceeds to run
the infected program normally.  Whenever a call is made to INT 21h to
execute a program (function 4Bh), the virus will append itself to the
program file on the disk and set itself up as the entry point for that
program.  This adds 1808 bytes of length to the file, but does not
change the time/date stamp.  If the disk is write-protected, no error
will be given, and the file will not be infected.  The copy of the
virus that I have been looking at infects .EXE files multiple times
(the Datamation article says that this is a bug that has been "fixed"
by hackers in other versions), so usually the major problem with this
virus will be that it will waste memory and disk space.  John McAfee's
article also says that this multiple infection does not occur with
.COM files, but I have not verified this.  The most serious aspect of
this virus is that when the system date is Friday the 13th (except
when the year is 1987--this virus was first discovered in 1987, so
this was probably written in to give it time to spread) any call to
execute a .COM or .EXE file will result in the file's being deleted
from the disk.

I have been informed that Flushot will take the virus out of infected
programs, so if you have the virus and Flushot, you might want to try
this.

Hope this has been of help.

Subject: virus problem undecidability

A note to the virus-l digest of 6-Nov-89 said that "the virus problem (at
least detection anyway) is undecidable."  Does anyone know if there are
any papers where this result is proved? Or where the problem is
shown to not be NP complete? Or even where the problem is stated
precisely?

Thanks,

Subject: KillVirus INIT (Mac)

Yes, the KillVirus INIT contains a "dummy" nVIR resource which it will
attempt to install into the System file. This resource will trigger
most less-sophisticated virus detectors. In addition, KillVirus is
supposed to be able to automatically uninfect files infected with the
A strain of nVIR. I haven't tested this, but I wouldn't want to bet
the farm on it.

Macwight is a name someone here at the U of R gave to an error we
found in a few copies of Macwrite.  Something or someone changed the
icon of Macwrite to show the word Macwite instead of the lines, and
the name of the the application to Macwite or Macwight.  After the
first few reports, I got a copy to play with for a while, but it was
taken and given to someone else.  Since then I haven't seen another,
nor have any of the student consultants.  I don't know if this was a
true virus, but it a copy of Macwrite changed before the consultant's
boss' eyes, ie the name changed from Macwrite to Macwite, and upon
inspection via Resedit the icon was found to have changed.

Subject: MacWight? (Mac)

You may (or may not :-) remember the discussions we had here on the
list about this. As far as I remember, there was never a specific
demonstration that there was a virus involved. That doesn't mean that
there wasn't; it just means that there were never quite enough facts
presented to make a case either way. I'd leave it off for now, or
mention it as a "rumored sighting" or whetever. Safest not to mention
it, especially since it was never pinned down and analyzed.

Subject: Dukakis Virus (Mac)

The "Dukakis Virus" was a self-perpetuating HyperCard script. When the
stack containing it was opened, it would first try to install itself
into the Home stack. The version in the Home stack would then spread
to other stacks.  Editing it out of the Home stack and installing an
"ON SET" script was sufficient to block it.

It was released on CompuServe and apparently was not set up to have a
long enough incubation time before it first went off. I believe it was
stamped out pretty quickly, but it did exist.

Worst, the actual script was published in the InfoMac digest...

The PC user has one weapon that is impactical on a mainframe:
THE PC USER CAN TURN OFF HIS MACHINE AT ANY TIME AND DISINFECT HIS SYSTEM
VERY EASILY.  NO VIRUS (THAT I KNOW OF) CAN LIVE THROUGH A COLD BOOT.

As long as PCs retain an OFF switch, then we have the ultimate power over
our compters, viruses or not.
