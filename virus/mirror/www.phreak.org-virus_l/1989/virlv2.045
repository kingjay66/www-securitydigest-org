A warning about this rumored trojan horse was recently distributed
here and below is the analysis which I sent back:

- - - - - - - - -

I have to wonder about the validity of this claim.  The "answerback"
is a feature of VT100-compatible terminals that can be programmed in
SETUP mode and sent by pressing CTRL-BREAK; it can also be triggered
by the host with the control character ENQ (05).  The thesis of this
claim appears to be that the answerback is reprogrammed with a control
sequence, presumably to contain something of the form "^ZDEL
*.*;*<CR>" and then an ENQ follows, which causes the terminal to send
the answerback, which is interpreted as typed commands by the host, in
this case to exit MAIL and delete files.

The problem with this is that I can find no way of setting the
answerback with a control sequence.  The VT100 and VT240 programmer's
guides, while notoriously poorly-indexed and arranged, are mum on this
point.  The Pericom MG400 (VT100-compatible) manual is more explicit;
it states that there is *no* way to program the answerback remotely.
This makes sense, in that the answerback is intended to be a function
of that specific terminal and there would be no reason to want the
capability to change it from a remote location.

All control characters can be sent in mail messages, so it is possible
to send the ENQ.  For that matter, you can send a ^S and freeze
someone's terminal so they have to reset it to get it working again
(of course, I have never done anything like that...).  However, I
don't think there is any way to change the answerback message from the
host and therefore I disbelieve this claim.

It *may* have happened at another site when some malicious user gained
access to another person or persons' terminal(s) and reprogrammed
their answerbacks to the string I described above *from the keyboard*
(which does not require any account access), then sent the message out
so that it would be read by users once they were logged in, when the
answerback could affect their account just as if they had typed the
commands themselves.

I'm including more text than I normally do because of the nature of this
message.

   [LT Stuart L Labovitz reports:] I am forwarding the following message,
   in full, from the VALERT virus alert mailing list.  I do not know if
   this is a valid message, or even if such a trojan could be
   constructed, but definitely want to pass the warning along to all the
   Info-Vaxers out there.  Please send copies of any comments on this
   warning to the original author (address at the end of the message), as
   to myself.  I will forward any comments I receive to the Virus-L
   mailing list at Lehigh University (VIRUS-L@LEHIIBM1.BITNET, moderator
   is Ken Van Wyk, LUKEN@LEHIIBM1.BITNET or LUKEN@SPOT.CC.LEHIGH.EDU).

   ================ORIGINAL MESSAGE FOLLOWS==============================

   The following was posted on our local bulletin board, so we're
   definitely getting into third- and fourth-hand information here.  This
   is really just a Trojan Horse rather than a virus, but I thought I'd
   pass it along.

   ------------------------
   Folks,
   What I am about to relate was triggered by a second-hand rumor,
   but it reflects a very valid security concern and is something that we
   may wish to deal with immediately.

   The rumor is that a Valentine's Day message has been prepared
   that has the potential for causing lots of personal (and operational)
   havoc.  Any user who reads this message, on a VAX system, using a
   standard DEC terminal, will have all of his files deleted.  This
   little nastygram is rumored to also put a sweet message and heart on
   the screen while doing its dirty work.  A nice touch.

   At the risk of being alarmist, I suggest that we immediately
   inform our users to be suspicious of any messages of unknown origin.
   Information is limited and we do not know if it will appear or how to
   recognize it if it does. If I get more information I'll send it along.
   -------------------------

   I have a few questions for anyone who knows VTxxx terminals:

   1)  Is it possible to do this on a VT1xx or VT2xx terminal?  I know it
           is possible to cause the answerback message to be echoed, but
           I don't know of a command to load the answerback message from
           the host; it is possible to load a definition into a (shifted)
           function key, but that requires the user to press the key;
           I know of no command to echo the contents of the screen back
           to the host as input.

   2)  If it is possible, is there a setup option that will immunize the
           terminal from this particular disease?

   This sort of attack has been known for years, especially on
   forms-oriented terminals, but I had believed that my terminal (a
   VT220) was not subject to this particular vulnerability.

   Has anyone else heard about this?  Has anyone actually SEEN this
   beast?  If you notice it ahead of time, it should be simple to
   determine what it does and where it came from (unless it's
   self-perpetuating like the XMAS EXEC -- but there's no easy list of
   destinations on VAX/VMS).

   P.S.  The lack of a way for this thing to hide its origins from anyone
           who is looking for it makes me wonder if it is real.  But I'll
           be looking over my incoming mail extra carefully for a few
           weeks anyway.  -- Gary


   =============END OF ORIGINAL MESSAGE==================================

This "rumor" is a wonderful example of a kind of "denial of service"
virus.  It infects the "wetware" of susceptible users.  Different
forms of this rumor have been floating around for several days now;
they've been passed around internally to DEC, for example.

There is NO truth behind this rumor.  What it describes is impossible,
for several reasons:

   a)  The VMS MAIL program filters out escape and control sequences
           when presenting mail to the user.  Even if there were a
           sequence which could cause damage, it can never reach the
           terminal as long as you use only READ to look at the message.

           It is theoretically possible, I suppose, that some non-ANSI-
           compatible terminals may be triggered by some sequence of
           characters that MAIL considers to be "just text", and so might
           be vulnerable.  But I doubt it.

   b)  A message COULD suggest that you type EXTRACT TT:, which would
           copy the message unfiltered to your terminal.  This trick
           is often used to send, say, ReGIS pictures through the mail.
           Obviously, this is a deliberate action - you have to be wil-
           ling to do it.  Just on general principles, you should NOT do
           this with a message from someone you don't know.

           A message could also tell you:  Type EXTRACT FOO.COM, CTRL/Z,
           and @FOO.  If you go ahead and do that,  you will create and
           execute a command file which could do anything at all.

           Then again, the message COULD tell you "Shoot yourself in the
           head".

   c)  No mainline DEC terminal allows you to set the answerback message
           from the host; it can be changed only in SETUP.  (And, no, you
           can't put the terminal into SETUP from the host.)  I know the
           people who designed every DEC terminal since the VT100, and
           worked on some of the designs, so I'm 100% certain of this.
           I include the "mainline" qualifier only because there are so
           many variations, mainly in international markets, which I know
           nothing about that I can't make an absolute statement.  But I
           would be very surprised if you could do this on ANY DEC ter-
           minal.

   d)  UDK's (User Defined Keys) are a slightly different story.  You can
           load them from the host but:

           1.  It is impossible for the host to force the terminal to
                   send the contents of a UDK - you must deliberately
                   type SHIFT with a function key to get the value sent.

           2.  When you load UDK's, you may ask the terminal to "lock"
                   them.  Once the UDK's are locked, any further attempts
                   load them are ignored.  Nothing the host sends can
                   unlock the UDK's - it can be done only from SETUP or
                   by power-cycling the terminal.

           If you don't use UDK's, (1) should protect you.  If you DO use
           UDK's, (2) can protect you (though you have to make sure you
           lock the definitions).

           Again, I can speak only of "mainline" DEC terminals.  One com-
           mon request is for the ability to have the UNSHIFTED function
           keys send the UDK sequences.  This has never been done in a
           mainline DEC terminal; one reason is that it could make a user
           who doesn't normally use UDK's, but DOES use the function
           keys, vulnerable.  Of course, if the choice of operational
           mode could be made only in SETUP, you'd still be safe.

   e)  Several DEC terminals support block mode.  I believe the VT131
           and VT132 and the VT330 and VT340 are the only "mainline"
           terminals that do so.  It MAY be possible to force such a
           terminal to send back data from the screen, in which case an
           attack of the nature being discussed here is possible.  I'm
           not absolutely certain, and the situation may be different
           on the different models.  What it comes down to is this:
           There is no defined sequence which tells the terminal to
           send data from the screen to the host; rather, such action is,
           in the documented cases, always initiated by the user typing
           something, usually ENTER.  However, it is possible to operate
           these terminals in a mode in which ENTER sends a "data ready
           for you" message, and the host then replies with "OK, send
           it".  What isn't clear is what happens, in all circumstances,
           if the host sends "OK, send it" when the terminal hasn't indi-
           cated it has data.  Probably nothing, but I can't guarantee
           that.

           In any case, on the VT330 and VT340, there is a SETUP option
           which disables block mode, so this becomes a non-issue.

   f)  ReGIS supports ways for the host to do some pretty complex things
           on the terminal, and get reports back.  It MAY be possible to
           use ReGIS for this kind of attack.  I've never seen a defini-
           tive analysis either way.

   g)  The VT220 (and VT320) support neither block mode nor ReGIS, and
           as far as I know are not vulnerable to this kind of attack.
           (The same goes for most VT100-generation terminals.  Some of
           them had firmware bugs which allowed "letter bombs" to disrupt
           the terminal, but none of those do anything permanent, or harm
           the connected system.)

   h)  The above applies ONLY to DEC terminals.  If you have a "DEC-com-
           patible", you have to read its documentation very, very care-
           fully to determine if you are safe.  Some compatibles try to
           "improve" on the original terminals by adding such "over-
           looked" features as escape sequences that let you program the
           answerback message from the host, or read arbitrary stuff from
           the screen.  Such "improvements" could leave you wide open.

           I have no particular compatibles in mind here - there may not
           actually BE any which have made this kind of change.  But to
           be safe, you have to be wary.  I'd be ESPECIALLY wary of ter-
           minal emulation programs running on PC's - they often have the
           opportunity to provide all sorts of nifty, but dangerous,
           features which the hardware manufacturers find too expensive
           to include.

If I recall correctly, there was a discussion about this on the RISKS
FORUM a while back (most probably a year or 2 ago).  If my memory
serves me correctly, I believe someone claimed that most dumb
terminals (not just the VTxxx's) could be made to echo a given message
back to the host through undocumented features/bugs.  Perhaps someone
who recalls the discussion better or who has easy access to RISKS
archives could give us more details.

P.S.  How does one distinguish between an undocumented feature and a
bug ?

Subject:      Re: Vt100 fun

Someone was wondering about the ability to have the VT100 series send
info from the screen. Yes, it is indeed possible: In order to type a
given character/ string, one positions the cursor on the (previously)
printed whateverness, and uses either the send-character or send-line
escape sequence. I know this back in my youth (high school), I played
around with the school's Tandy 6000 (I take what I can get), a Xenix
machine. I used the above trick to issue "cds" that would have lasting
effects (after a Xenix script ends, the current directory is reverted)
from scripts (to be executed as commands). Admittedly there are better
ways, but I didn't know them.  So much for nostalgia.

Subject:      Media: a different aspect

I was just paging through "Business Today", a magazine mailed to
college students around the country, and stumbled upon the following
ad:

Under a picture of a 3M data cartridge it read: "Until There's a Cure
For Computer Viruses, Take One Of These And Get Back To Work."  Under
that, in smaller type, read: "Today, with the spread of computer
viruses and data parasites threatening the health of American
business, you have to protect yourself.  If you network, be sure to
back up your work routinely on 3M data cartridge tape before a virus
enters your systems."  Then it lists an '800' number to call for info.

First, I hope noone thinks I am trying to use Bitnet for commercial
use -- I'm not.  I have no affiliation with 3M.

I am all for encouraging users to institute systematic, periodic
backup procedures.  However, ads like this compound the user confusion
we have (to some extent) been blaming on the media -- that if you
perform regular backups you are safe.

It is unfortunate that our counterparts in industry are not assisting
in rectifying the (perhaps unsolvable, yet certainly *not*
unimprovable) problem.
