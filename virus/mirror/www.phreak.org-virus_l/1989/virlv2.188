VIRUS-L Digest   Thursday,  7 Sep 1989    Volume 2 : Issue 188

VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

It was my understanding that the locked disk signal is read by
software, not by the Mac's hardware.  The standard device driver(s)
for the floppy may prevent writing to a locked disk, but a virus could
override the driver(s) and infect the disk --- if my understanding is
correct.

[Ed. VIRUS-L veterans will recognize this topic, much to their
consternation.  Please folks, let's *PLEASE* not flood the "airwaves"
with hearsay.  If someone has something that can be substantiated
(preferably via a citation from a vendor's technical document) to
offer on this, then please do so - otherwise, please let us all RUN
LIKE MAD AWAY FROM THIS TOPIC.]

# Introduction to the Anti-viral archives...
# Listing of 06 September 1989

This posting is the introduction to the "official" anti-viral archives
of virus-l/comp.virus.  With the generous cooperation of many sites
throughout the world, we are attempting to make available to all
the most recent news and programs for dealing with the virus problem.
Currently we have sites for Amiga, Apple II, Atari ST, IBMPC and
Macintosh microcomputers, as well as sites carrying research papers
and reports of general interest.

We are also in the process of organizing a number of sites for Unix
anti-viral and general security issues.  More information on that
as things progress.

If you have general questions regarding the archives, you can send
them to this list or to me.  I'll do my best to help.  If you have a
submission for the archives, you can send it to me or to one of the
persons in charge of the relevant sites.

If you have any corrections to the lists, please let me know.

 *** Forwarding note from KIEFFER --UNCANET  09/06/89 19:48 ***

 A computer virus has just appeared in the CERNVM system in the form of
 a set of files which copy themselves to your A-disk when you execute
 the commands RELEASE or DROP.  The mechanism is that there is a modified
 RELEASE EXEC which invokes a module called DVHVIR which copies itself,
 plus other files, to your A-disk. It is sufficient to be linked to a disk
 containing these viruses to be vulnerable to them. Some of the copied files
 pretend to be parts of the directory maintenance system and we do not
 yet know what damage they may cause.
 Please take the following action: look for any of the following files on
 your disks and ERASE them at once

         RELEASE EXEC
         DVHGMN  EXEC
         DVHGKB  EXEC
         DMSXMS  EXEC
         DVHVIR  MODULE

         We are attempting to find the source of this virus and are taking
 other preventative measures.
