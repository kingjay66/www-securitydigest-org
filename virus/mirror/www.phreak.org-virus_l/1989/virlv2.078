Disinfectant detects and removes all the currently known code-based
viruses (there are script-based viruses, like the Hypercard Dukakis
virus, which won't be touched by this program). It also removes
multiple infections, which is an innovation in the virus fighting
world.  The user interface is simple, the on-line documentation
extensive and accurate. And, furthermore, it is free. Its author is
John Norstad (jln@nuacc.bitnet).

It has a minor problem in conjunction with servers: moving or deleting
files on the server while Disinfectant is browsing through the
directories may cause the program to skip some files. This problem is
common to most disk browsers. Nevertheless, the author is working on
the problem. The current solution to the problem is to disconnect or
write-protect the server for other users while Disinfectant is
running.

The current version is configured for following viruses: MacMag (aka
Peace, Drew, FreeHand, etc.), Scores, nVIR A and B as well as its two
name mutations Hpat and AIDS, INIT29 and ANTI. If you have the founded
impression that a virus is missing in the list, drop me or John a mail.
The 'Sneak' virus has only been rumored. No one who claimed having
seen it has been able to found his claims.

Another Trojan EXEC!

            IMPROPER EXEC with UNETHICAL Embedded CODE
          Causes Possible SECURITY Situation on Network

An EXEC that contains questionable code has been discovered on the
network--the EXEC is a sexually oriented game called "4PLAY" which
apparently has existed for 18 months.

Embedded within the code are commands that record all console activity
which is then collected and sent to a specific network userid.  This is
done without the knowledge or consent of the person activating this code
(that is, playing the game).  This presents an obvious intrusion of
privacy and also a "security hole".

The security problem arises in that the EXEC does not close the
CONSOLE.  (If it did, the user would receive a message allowing her or
him to to detect the recording of information entered.) The result is
that console activity continues to be recorded after the completion of
the game and UNTIL the user actually LOGs off the account.
Consequently, the unsuspecting user may be transmitting other data as
well, that is, any confidential data that the console processes in
line mode will be recorded, possibly compromising security: passwords
could be transmitted.

When the user signs off the userid accessing this EXEC, the capturing
of all console activity ceases.

THE USE OF COMPUTER NETWORKS TO OBTAIN INFORMATION WITHOUT THE PRIOR
KNOWLEDGE AND CONSENT OF THE USER IS UNETHICAL.

THE USE OF BITNET FOR TRANSMITTING SUCH GAMES AR THIS IS NOT WITHIN
BITNET's MISSION TO ENHANCE EDUCATION AND RESEARCH.


If you are aware that this software exists on your system, the BITNIC
encourages you to contact the persons responsible for your system and
alert them to the situation and the need for removal of this software.

The following action to curtail such activity, taken by the node that
identified the problem, may be helpful to you in guarding against such
network misuse:

Immediately--remove the offending software and warn users.
Long term----use a security system (if you have one) to permit only
authorized id's to send spool data or files beyond your node.

AIDS Warning

Macintosh Virus.
AIDS spreads using applications and system.
nVIR clone !!!!!

I do not know, if someone reported this virus already.  Some one
changed all ASCCI strings 'nVIR' to 'AIDS'.  So the AIDS virus is
nVIR. Fast way to get rid of the virus is the following.

Get a copy of ANTIPAN, and a file editor, SUM, MacTools or FEdit,
change all nVIR strings in ANTIPAN to AIDS, and your problem is
solved. If the resource 'CODE' id 0 is locked or protected, the
ANTIPAN program does not remove the virus. Unlock or unprotect the
resource using ResEdit
