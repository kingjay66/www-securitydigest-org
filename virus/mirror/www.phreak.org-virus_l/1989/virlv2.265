VIRUS-L Digest   Wednesday, 20 Dec 1989    Volume 2 : Issue 265

VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,

Subject: Legal Implications of the PC Cyborg Mailing

Since it contained the greatest amount of information regarding
licensing, payment, what it purported to be, etc.  than the other
postings, I have sent Mr. McAfee's first alert re this Trojan Horse to
a dear friend, Paul R. Paletti, Jr., Esq.  of Handmaker, Citrynell &
Assoc. in Louisville, Ky.

Mr. Paletti is a licensed, practicing attorney-at-law who is also a
computer enthusiast.  He uses his PC in his work, downloading cases
from LEXIS via modem.

When he has time to read my fax, we'll confer by phone and I'll send
his opinions to this discussion list.  Since copyright and patent laws
are federal ones, he should be as qualified as anyone to assess the
legal ramifications of this catastrophe.

Subject: AIDS disk analogies (PC)

In reading the analogies pertaining to the AIDS Virus, I could not
help but be struck by some parallels between the computer virus and
the actual virus.  First, like AIDS, some people are struck down very
quickly while for others there is a long incubation process.  Second,
once you find out that you have it, you must be prepared to spend
large sums of money to combat it on a recurring basis.  Third, lots of
warnings are given about the virus, what will happen if you utilize
the disk (engage in risk behavior) but many people ignore these
warnings and are thus infected.  Fourth, the Virus comes from Africa,
the probable birthplace of the actual AIDS virus. Fifth, there is no
guarantee that paying your money will produce a cure, or that one cure
actually exists (tailoring vaccine to specific machines/people).
Sixth, the hysteria surrounding the VIRUS is both making people more
aware of viruses in general and prompting much research into finding a
way to decrypt the initiating factor.  Seventh, there seems to be more
we don't know about the Virus than we do know.  The initial effects
have been diagnosed and a remedy for the symptoms found but long term
effects are still unknown.

Perhaps I am seeing too much in this, but given the enormous outlay of
both time, energy and money that someone went through; perhaps the
perpetrators of this virus are attempting to give us all a non-lethal
lesson as to what the real virus AIDS is all about.  I am not
justifying their actions but I just can't help but wonder if that
lesson is what all this is all about.  It would, to me, clarify the
use of AIDS Information as the method of transmission.

Comments, anyone

The "ADBS" resource in the Desktop file is almost certainly not a virus.
Rather, it's the signature for the Adobe Separator application.

Unfortunately, "ADBS" is one of the resource-types that Apple has
reserved for its own use... per Inside Mac V, resources of this type
hold code which acts as an interface to the Apple Desktop Bus and its
devices (keyboard, mouse, etc.).  Because this resource-type can contain
executable code, Gatekeeper Aid considers that it shouldn't be in the
Desktop file.

I don't know how a commercial application ended up with a signature-
resource that's identical to one on Apple's list of reserved types.
there are several ways in which this could have happened... all of
which would appear to involve a bit of an oversight on someone's part.

Removing this particular resource from the Desktop file might have some
adverse effects on the Adobe Separator application.  In particular, I
might expect to see its documents revert to the generic icon, and you
might not be able to double-click on a Separator document and launch the
application.

I believe that Chris will be updating the documentation for Gatekeeper Aid
to warn of this problem.

Subject: Signature Programs

In his mailing of Dec 07 '89, Y. Radai seems to be taking the position
that since I am in favor of sophisticated authentication algorithms, I
must be against sophisticated program implementations. Nothing could
be further from the truth. A really reliable virus detection program
must have BOTH a trustworthy authentication algorithm and a
sophisticated implementation. I stressed the importance of
sophisticated authentication algorithms only because as a newcomer to
VIRUS-L, I was seeing a lot more discussion of implementation details
and scanner programs than of quality authentication techniques.

Please don't misinterpret me: PROGRAMS THAT PURPORT TO DEFEND AGAINST
VIRUSES MUST BE EXTREMELY CAREFULLY WRITTEN. In my view, they should
use the best and most sophisticated defenses available. Today, that
means authentication algorithms should be based on published standards
that have stood the test of time, such as ANSI X9.9. Obviously if a
clever virus writer is able to orchestrate a situation in which the
virus is never examined, then even a sophisticated authentication
algorithm is of no use.  What is needed is a well-written and
convenient program that applies a sophisticated authentication
algorithm across all program code without exception. Clearly this is
better than a well-written and convenient program that applies some
programmer's guess at an authentication algorithm across all program
code without exception!

The address where copies of ANSI X9.9 can be obtained didn't make it
into my last posting. Sorry about that. Copies of ANSI X9 standards
can be obtained through:

Subject: Gatekeeper and Gatekeeper Aid (Mac)

In Michigan State University's public laboratory, we have run into
many viruses including the WDEF virus.  We decided to put Gatekeeper
and Gatekeeper aid on our system disks.  To protect these files from
being erased, they were made invisible using MacTools.  Now in the
control panel, the Gatekeeper icon does not show up.  Question: Does
this mean that Gatekeeper is not active?  What about Gatekeeper Aid?

   Please correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't DES or DES-like
encryption algorithms readily available?  For example, the book
"Numerical Recipes, The Art of Scientific Computing," by W.H. Press,
B.P. Flannery, S.A.  Teukolsky, and W.T. Vetterling, published by
Cambridge University Press, (c)1986, p. 214-220 gives an algorithm for
DES (two and one half pages of highly-inefficient FORTRAN-like code).
Admittedly, the authors state that their program is not genuinely DES
(since the standard itself explicitly states that any implementation
in software is not secure and therefore not DES), but it does in
software the same thing real DES hardware would do, so it is for all
practical purposes DES.  (Also, how does the claim that software
versions of DES are technically not DES affect legal issues raised by
IA96000@PACE about exporting DES?).  Also, in my opinion, there is
nothing special about DES except that it is a kind of "standard"
algorithm (i.e. I think one can easily imagine other
equally-difficult- to-decrypt algorithms).

actualy, the licensing notices reminds me of the popular "shrink-wrap"
licenses where by breaking the shrink-wrap, you agree to the terms of
the license.  making the necessary action "running the program" doesn't
seem much different to me (though i'm not a lawyer).

so, assuming the people who's machines have been struck are in violation
of a "legally enforceable" licensing agreement, is the destruction of
data or denial of servicesomething they can sue over?  some of the
purveyors of data-block protection schemes for PCs seem to have provisions
that cause the program to stop working if monthly payments aren't made.

a friend of mine points out that there are also "good faith" types of
clauses in the law that hold that given the method of distribution,
the license agreement would not be valid.  it would be highly interesting
to see the PC Cyborg Corp. sue afflicted PC owners for breach of license!

I would like to correct the impression your assertion creates. That is
that the AIDS virus is from Nigeria. The names are quite exotic but as
a Nigerian I'd like to inform you of a fact you neglected: that the
names might be false . Well, Well, Well: the NAMES are all FALSE. We
don't answer such names. As a regular user of the PC, just as I would
like you to get to the bottom of this problem because it's a real
international problem, I would like you to be objective. Somebody
somewhere is/are covering his/their track(s) by stringing a red
herring.

Doesn't the name Mekonen remind you of a personality in Startrek?

I'm ready to be flamed but I can assure you that the above names are
fictitious. We certainly have not come of age in Computer Science to
produce such destructive weapons. It's obvious that some malefactor
somewhere is hiding under certain names to do his/their evil deeds.

Subject: Was AIDS disk legal?

Martin Ward is quite right to say that:

>the effects of this disk are entirely in accordance with the standard
>warrenty used by most commercial software developers

however, I do not think that makes it legal.  Firstly there is the
question of blackmail.  This can mean either making an impropor
demand, or using impropor means to enfore a legitimate demand.  While
it could certainly be argued that they are quite within their rights
to demand payment, and could reasonably disable their own program
until such payment was made, I would hope that planting a logic bomb
that encrypted all the user's other files would not be considered a
propor means of enforcing that demand.

Secondly, there is criminal damage.  This is trickier, since although
a great deal of damage was certainly done, technically the program
acts in full accordance with the information given in the warrenty.
Furthermore, it is obviously not illegal to sell programs that can
wipe your hard disk (eg. Norton, or most other disk utilities).  I
suspect that the issue might come down to one of causality: By writing
the program, did the authors (legally) CAUSE the data to be lost , or
was the chain broken by a voluntary act on the part of the user.

Again, my hope would be that the former is the case.  The authors
almost certainly knew that most users would try out the program
without reading, or without fully comprehending the implications of
the warrenty.  They were tricking the users into executing the
program, and the users were behaving in a perfectly natural and
predictible manner.

Please note that I am not saying that every piece of defective
software is a case of criminal damage: if you write a program in good
faith, the element of mens rae does not exist (though that would not
protect you against a civil or criminal action for negligence).  In
this case, though, I think it quite reasonable to conclude that the
authors almost certainly acted with malicious intent.

DISCLAIMER: I am a Astronomer, not a Lawyer.  The above information is
not warrentied for any purpose whatsoever.

This is the kind that implies that if by mistake I do something that
causes a problem tuff (in the US I believe several companies are
trying to reclaim money caused by losses resulting from bugs in
spreadsheet software).

Martin's point is interesting but worse still the warranty and license
agreement sent out with the AIDS Infromation Disk specifically state that:
"Warning: Do not use these programs if you are not prepared to pay for them''
and
"..program mechanismis will adversely affect other program applications...''
and
"..faliure to abide by this license......your conscience may haunt you for
the rest of your life ....... your microcomputer will stop functioning
normally."

Generally if you read the license agreement you would NOT use the program.
The legallity of the license is questionable but probably no more so than
the comercial one described by Martin.  At one time several reputable
software companies were rumered to have been contemplating using
a copy protection scheme that would have caused damage and data loss if the
program was illegally copied.  Luckily for us Software houses went the
opposite way to a non copy protected world.

Maybe this is nothing more than a copy protection scheme that isn't
quite as good as it is supposed to be -- it has bugs that cause it to go
off sooner than the anticipated 90days after installation.

An antidote to the two known phases of the program mechanism has already
been written and is available from our BBS (+44 1 863 6646) and from the
PC Business World (Tel: +44 831 9252).  We are only speculating that
the program does other detrimental things to your system until they are seen
the programs effects appear to be reversable.

Whatever the reason behind this mailing it sould only warn people to remind
ALL users not to use and disk sent to them, especially if it is unsollicited.

PS If any users have installed the AIDS program then I can mail them the
antidote for it.  Please mail me with your requests.

Subject: Standard disclaimers and AIDS Trojan horse

In VIRUS-L #261, Martin Ward asks whether the standard warranty is
illegal, or the developers of the AIDS-trojan are within their rights.

I am a programmer, not a lawyer, so I can not quote specific law with
any authority; suffice it to say that the disclaimers that come with
most of the software I buy observe that the liabilities of the
manufacturer or distributor of a program vary between jurisdictions.

However, from the point of view of a programmer, I can point out that
there is a great difference between disclaiming responsibility for the
way a program will behave on any arbitrarily chosen machine, and writing
a program with the deliberate intention of causing harm. Whether a court
would appreciate the difference remains to be seen, but in this case, if
a case can be made that the demand for money the "AIDS" program makes is
extortion, I doubt that any disclaimer could protect the authors.

As for the legal (not to say ethical) question of whether is it is ever
acceptable for a programmer to write a harmful program, there is (or was)
a case that may shed some light on this issue: Eric Newhouse, in his
newsletter on illegal programs, trojan horses, and viruses, claimed that
a "legitimate" commercial outfit had written a trojan horse that claimed
to crack softguard protection on a file, but actually destroyed the user's
data. The claim he reported that the company in question made was that
since an attempt to crack softguard protection was a violation of a
license agreement, they data of such users was fair game. Mr. Newhouse
indicated that the authors of this trojan were being taken to court,
which may (if the issue is through the courts yet) shed some light on
the judicial perception of this issue.
