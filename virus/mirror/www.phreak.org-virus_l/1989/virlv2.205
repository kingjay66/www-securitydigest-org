VIRUS-L Digest   Wednesday, 27 Sep 1989    Volume 2 : Issue 205

VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ I only recognize this name as being a guy who worked/works
 at microsoft, he was profiled in the microsoft press book _Porgrammers at
 Work_.

 Plus it's pretty unlikely that microsoft would copyright a virus.

 Of course, it could just be a ruse...

Subject: Anti-virus virus

   One of the arguments raised against AVV's is the possible escalation of
of viral warfare.  It seems to me that this has already happened with the
vaccine programs.
   I'd be almost certain that most virus writers will try to circumvent
detection by writing (perhaps) a self-modifying virus, or a resident virus
that will attempt to detect detection.
   If any comp.virus readers have read any of William Gibson's "Cyperpunk"
novels, in which software protection (ICE) is handled by AI, the concept
of AVV's will be nothing new.
   From a technological standpoint, they provide an interesting challenge,
both for the virus writer and anti-virus virus writer.

Sounds basically like the Jerusalem Virus; in particular, the
little signature string given occurs in the JV.   Not sure
why they aren't seeing files change in size when they're
infected.   Perhaps the fact that a file gets infected when
it executes (rather than when the original infected file executes)
is causing confusion.  The multiple infections that they're
seeing (and attributing to disk fragmentation) are also
characteristic of the JV.  Or, of course, it could be some
Brand New nasty...                    DC

Subject: LAN boot disks. (PC)

If your LAN o/s and cards support the function - try auto boot roms.
We run Novell nets with various cards that all autoboot from a server.
(Novell 2.1x allows you to have multiple boot files for different pcs)

This method keeps the boot code very safe, allows for global changes,
and the students just need a blank formatted disk.

In addition, any new software gets installed from an account that does
*not* have supervisor's (operator) status - one dept. forund that out
the hard way.

    The new Lotus 123 virus is being turned over to Lotus Corp (a CVIA

file and no-one other than Lotus was willing to attempt a disassembly.
The CVIA will publish results as soon as we get them.

Oh well, I was considering writing to VIRUS-L about this anyway, and
this posting precipitates a response.  Here is the current situation
about the virus that showed up at Sibley Hall at Cornell University.

John McAfee's VIRUSCAN v36 identified this virus as Jerusalem B, and
its appearance and behavior correspond with this identification, AS
FAR AS I KNOW.  (Would some kind soul please send me a type
description of "Jerusalem B" so I can verify the identification more
completely?  I think this is the version of the Israeli that attacks
both .COM and .EXE files on both floppy and hard disks, that was
modified (probably in the U.S.) to be less obtrusive, and that
WordPerfect and FoxBase catch in the act because they detect its
alteration of their file.) We are using UNVIRUS, which we retrieved
from the archive at Kansas State, to clean up.

Incidentally, we find VIRUSCAN and SCANRES very useful and intend to
ask Mr. McAfee about site licensing arrangements for Cornell
University.  (That's why we haven't sent in our shareware fees yet!
Most of us on the staff here won't use software without paying for it,
except preliminarily.)  However, do not let this kind of endorsement
of one person's (or group's) efforts deter those of you who are
writing other protective software.  No single program, indeed no
single way of addressing the problem, will be sufficient to protect a
diverse computing community like this from the threat of viruses.
This semester we may recommend SCANRES, but we are counting on there
still being a lot of people using FLU_SHOT+ here, and next semester we
may recommend something else, or a newer version of FLU_SHOT, or a
program that checks CRC polynomials to detect altered files or disk
sectors.  The idea is that in a large and diverse community like a
major university, a virus may get started locally but it won't get
very far before it sets off an alarm on someone's system.  If everyone
using PC's were using the same kind of protection, a virus written to
evade that particular protection would spread farther.  This is not a
new idea, it's one I learned from reading this list!  Thank you all.

Subject: Tiger Teams

   Maybe I just don't understand, but I personally think the "Tiger Team"
idea put forth (by David Gursky) on this list is a little ridiculous
because:
   1) Most viruses are not spread by someone sneaking in at night and
against your wishes copying something onto your computer.  Rather,
they are usually spread voluntarily (but unknowingly) by the user
exposing the computer to foreign contaminated disks or programs.  If I
always (almost always anyway) operate within a closed system, how is
letting someone *tamper* with my computer going to help me? I'd feel
much safer just scanning for known viruses, which brings up the next
point.
   2) What corporation (or employee for that matter) is willing to
take the risk of letting someone (outsiders or corporation employees)
*tamper* with the computers which the company (and the employee)
depends upon, especially when proper operating procedures (regular
backups, etc.) will offer you very good protection?
   3) Can you guarantee that the "Team" will not do damage?  No, you
cannot.  And if they are introducing live viruses, we already know
that no one can guarantee that the viruses will be benign in every
situation (as has been discussed many times by others on this list),
or that they will not get away.

It's probably been mentioned before, but it can't hurt to repeat.
Some software houses--especially discount stores--have a very liberal
return policy.  Unfortunately, it seems that shrinkwrap equipment is
neither very expensive nor difficult to obtain, and some stores will
accept such returned software, repackage and re-shrinkwrap it, and
return it to the store shelf.  Thus, you really can't be certain that
the sealed shrink-wrap you bought *hasn't* been tampered with at some
point along the line.

It really is starting to look like either there will have to be
tamper-proof shrinkwrap (as resulted from the Tylenol disaster in the
OTC consumer market), or a general practice of scanning *any*
purchased software for contamination...

Subject: Tiger Teams & Viruses

Someone has suggested that "Tiger Teams" use (as one of their tests)
viruses. A "controlled" atmosphere is suggested.

Like the idea of an anti-virus virus, this usage may run out of
control and cause more damage than expected. If the tiger team fails
to exterminate ALL copies of the virus (which is very likely in the
chaotic user environment), there is the possibility of virus parinoia
(i.e. lawsuits), files that grow in size for no good reason (very
dangerous when a disk is full or nearly so [programs abend or refuse
to run]), and the possibility of lost data thru virus malfunctions.

Another problem is the nature of a tiger team using a virus: the virus
would be released in a (probably) unsuspecting work area. The presence
of strangers insisting on checking every disk that leaves the area
(and don't forget the problem of LANs and file transfers) would cause
chaos.

Remember, a "good" virus used for a "good" purpose would have to be
working perfectly. And we all know how programs work perfectly under
all conditions all the time :-)

Subject: Disk Killer Virus (PC)

The CVIA has isolated the "Disk Killer" virus after 6 months of work
and over three dozen reports.  The virus activates after a random time
period which varies from a few days to a few months, and when it
activates, it performs a low level format of the hard disk - thereby
destroying itself along with everything else.  As it formats, it
displays the message - "Disk Killer -- Version 1.00 by COMPUTER OGRE.
Don't turn off the power or remove the diskettes while Disk Killer is
processing.  I wish you luck."  The first organization to report this
virus was Birchwood systems in San Jose in early Summer.  Additional
reports were received from Washington, Oklahoma, Minnesota and
Arizona.  We finally isolated it at Wedge Systems in Milpitas
California and discovered that it is a boot sector infector that
infects hard disks and floppies.  The internal messages do not appear
in sector zero, but are stored in sector 152 on floppy disks and an as
yet undetermined location on hard disks.  This had always added to the
confusion over the virus because message remnants were sometimes
discovered in the middle of executable files, and it was assumed that
the virus was a COM or EXE infector.  The virus appears to be very
widespread and everyone should watch out for it.  If your boot sector
does not contain the standard DOS error messages, then immediately
power down and clean out the boot.

(Infected boot sectors begin with FAEB).  This is a nasty virus and
should be treated cautiously.  ViruScan V39 identifies the virus, but
it will not be posted till the 29th due to major revisions in SCAN's
architecture for version 39.

ViruScan V37 was recently uploaded to SIMTEL20, and a question about

Apparently the length of the SCAN program is 34 bytes longer than the

versions.

Is this a valid copy, or might it have a little parasite attached ?
