These propositions were never meant to be an original statement of
mine.  Rather, I sent an answer to somebody having posted a
virus-related question in the LIAISON list, and I thought this would
be intersting to VIRUS-L subscribers, as an example how to present
basic ideas to "the public".

Regrettably, I was not aware that the message-header (which would have
revealed my intention) was bound to be stripped off during VIRUS-L's
digesting process.  Hence, in similar cases, I'll have to prepare a
separate copy of my note for VIRUS-L to include a suitable
introductory statement.

Y. Radai's reply to me in v2n24 is largely well-taken.  I didn't mean
to imply that the scheme I described was itself a perfect virus
defense, although it probably sounded that way.  All I meant to
suggest by the example is that there is *some* hope for anti-virus
schemes in which it will do the virus writer little or no good to have
the source of the anti-virus program, and that it will therefore not
forever be the case that anti-virus efforts must depend on the
ignorance of the virus authors.

Radai, if you're going to tell us about the "loopholes" anyway, why
not just list them here, to give us something to think about while we
await the finished paper?  (I have no particular advice about whether
or not to reveal them, although I think it's unlikely that a decision
by you not to talk about them would do much to keep the virus writers
from discovering them!)

On "no mechanism can exist that cannot be infected": again, I think
that's too strong ("never say never...").  A virus would have a hard
time infecting a progra stored in ROM, for instance: if the ROM was
clean when burned (and it's certainly possible to verify that), it'll
stay that way, no?

In general, of course, it's a good idea to think about ways that a
virus author could get around any particular anti-virus scheme.  But I
don't think we'll *necessarily* see an unending escalation.

     Could anyone give me a definition of what a trojan horse and a
worm is, and what makes these different from viruses?

Thanks

Subject: Friday the 13th worm at Digital Equipment Corp.

>From Digital News, January 23, 1989 issue (author Stephen Lawton):

"A late-night, Friday-the-13th worm that entered Digital Equipment
Corp.'s internal Easynet network in Maynard, Mass., earlier this month
bit off more than it could chew.  A systems manager spotted the
abnormal activity 'virtually as it entered' and was able to segregate
the infected system before the worm could spread, according to the
company.

Spokeswoman Nikki Richardson said the infected system was disconnected
immediately from the network while a vaccine program was developed and
installed.  The system was returned to the network before employees
arrived for work Monday morning, she said.

Unlike a virus, which replicates itself and destroys or modifies
data, a worm only replicates itself.

Digital would not disclose what type of system was involved, although
Richardson said she believes it was a VMS-based system, the
predominant system on the network."

Interesting...  It's nice to hear that DEC was able to stop it before
it caused any harm, I imagine that a congratulations is in order if
the report is accurate.

The scary part about the report, in my opinion, is the definition of
virus vs. worm; it's blatantly wrong.  In "Computer Viruses: Theory
and Experiments" (Computers & Security 6 (1987) p. 22-35), Fred Cohen
defined a virus as, "...a program that can 'infect' other programs by
modifying them to include a possibly evolved version of itself."
There's no mention of destroying or modifying data there.  In fact, in
his dissertation, Dr. Cohen even used an example of a virus that could
be worthwhile, a "compression virus" that would compress executable
files on disk in order to save disk space.
