VIRUS-L Digest   Tuesday,  5 Sep 1989    Volume 2 : Issue 185

VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

I teach a class on hard disk management. Naturaly I cover virues, but
do not have a list of virus names and what programs are currently
available to combat these viruses. Coulde someone please post a list
of this information. Could you also include some information about
the CV group who are working to combat these viruses.
                              Thanks, Chuck

DOS has always done this, I think.  I believe some versions of the
documentation Strongly Warn against switching diskettes during the
"Abort, Retry..." message.  I realize that may not be much
consolation!  But it's not a virus, at least...

Well, with a virus (take scores for example), you could identify the
infected files and then view them with a utility like Fedit+. I think
that would be a better way to view the code than Resedit.

Subject: Columbus Day Virus and Lehigh (PC)

        Ken van Wyk asks about the Columbus day Virus.  It's the same as
the DataCrime virus versions one and two (not to be confused with the
DataCRime II).  Columbus day is October 12.  The Datacrime versions 1 and 2
activate on October 12.  I would discourage the use of "Columbus Day Virus"
as a name, since DatCrime has been an accepted name for quite some time.
        Also, the Lehigh original virus has been sporadically reported at
dozens of installations outside of the university for over a year.  It is
not a particulary successful replicator -- probably because of the extremely
short activation fuse - and it is difficult to detect and report because
there are few symptoms prior to activation.  Buit there should certainly be
no surprise that it's in the public domain.  In John McAfee's report to the
CVIA on epidemiology he writes - "The belief that viruses can be contained
by early counter-action is belied by the Lehigh University experience.  I
have spoken to a number of individuals at the University who belived that
the virus had somehow been contained because "no copies of the virus were
distributed to outside organizations".  This assumed, of course, that the
original virus writer gave up after being foiled at Lehigh and did not insert
the virus at any other location, and that all copies of the virus at Lehigh
had indeed been accounted for.  The first issue rests solely in the hands of
the perpetrator and is beyond any containment controls.  The second issue
relies on an error-free containment process - allowing no possibility for
overlooking, losing or mistaking an infected diskette.  In any case, the
Lehigh virus was by no means contained.  I received a copy, as did virtually
every virus researcher, in mid-1988, and infection reports issued throughout
the year from universities, corporations and individual computer users."
        I think John said it better than I could, but my sentiments exactly.

This is a known behavior of MS-DOS.  The directory and FAT have
already been read before the write protect error is sensed, and
when you say retry, DOS doesn't know that you have changed disks,
so it doesn't reread the directory info.

Subject: Virus or no? Help please (PC)


    At our university a student came in and described a problem with
his AT compatible and wondered if it was a virus.  The symptoms
follow:

    1. lots of garbage on screen.
    2. repeat of dos prompt across the screen.
    3. I view all my files with .sys and found word BUG .
    4  I could't do any work at the time, but following day all
        seemed okay.

Any of you IBM specialists have any ideas on this one?

In response to the question about the FAT from a locked disk being
written to another disk this is a feature of MS-DOS, not a virus.

Another chilling scenario conserns running an application such as a
word processor, opening a document, exchangeing data diskettes, and
saving a "backup" of the file.  This often hoses the "backup" disk and
sometines affects the origional file.

Subject: Kim's question concerning FATs (PC)

In response to Kim:
    I'm no expert at MS-DOS or software-stuff, but I've been poking
around in my computer's memory long enough to believe that what you
are describing may be normal with MS-DOS.  Often I see that within
memory, data stays in its assigned spot until something moves or
writes over it.  I notice this effect with a certain software
word-processing/graphing/spreadsheet package I have.  Sometimes when I
am retreiving data with my package, I place a data disk first before
putting in the main program disk. The program needs to do something
with the disk with the main program first, so the package asks for the
main program disk.  Whe the directory pops up for the main program
disk, it shows a conglomeration of the files on the curent disk PLUS
the files that were on the removed data disk and some random garbage.
Nothing grave has happened to my files with this package (It came with
my computer.  It wasn't PD/Shareware, either.), so I feel that this
may be either a DOS bug (not writing over completely the FAT) or
something normal.  Of course, I've never really had an opportunity to
look at the directory track on any disks, so I can't confirm that this
is absolutely true.  I can find out.  Has anyone out there found mixed
FATs affecting the performance of their disks?

   It's a "feature" of MSDOS - when you attempt to write on a floppy,
MSDOS reads the FAT and  Directory and re-writes it when you are done.
If you swap floppies, you get the old information on the new disk.

  The rule is: NEVER NEVER replace a floppy with another in the middle
of a write or a write protect error.  Pick the Abort option, not the
Retry option; then start the process all over.

  Anyway, it's not a virus, it's just Bill Gates getting even with the
world for making him a billionaire.

Subject: Columbus Day "virus" (PC)

Yes, I have heard of the "Columbus Day 'virus'".  What I have heard is
a pronouncement from a certain Dr. S. that this thing exists and on
Friday, October 13th, this bugger is going to strike and start causing
problems.

IMO, this sounds suspiciously like the Jerusalem/Hebrew University
virus, *at this point*.

Emily Lonsford, a fellow MITRE-ite and contributor here, has meet Dr.
S., and was less then impressed with him and his techniques.

Of course, none of this means that this virus does not exist as a
seperate strain from existing viruses.  Barring independant
confirmation of this virus, my opinion is that no extraordinary action
is needed.

[Ed. Thanks for the info - in fact, I received a number of replies
about the Columbus Day virus.  Most replies indicated that it was the
DataCrime virus.  Thanks to all those who replied!]

And then you will have virus writers 'discovering' their own work to

Subject: Appleshare and viruses ?

What are the conditions under which current Mac viruses can
infect files on Appleshare volumes?

  a.  All ashare files are susceptible if volume is mounted
      to an infected Mac.
  b.  Only files in write- AND read-enabled folders are
      susceptible.
  c.  Files in write-enabled folders are susceptible (read
      access doesn't matter).
  d.  Files in read-enabled folders are susceptible (write
      access doesn't matter).
  e.  Gee, the students are back in town, better lock up your
      file servers.
