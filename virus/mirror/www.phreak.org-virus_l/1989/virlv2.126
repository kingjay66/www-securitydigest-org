Subject: Computer Virus Catalogue (Aims and Scope)
 
After having reverse-engineered several viruses on different PCs
(AMIGA, Atari, MacIntosh and IBM), we have developped (and
experimentally tested, in a German mailbox of the national Informatics
society, since December 1988) a format in which we describe essential
features of computer viruses: the Computer Virus Catalog. Thanks to
Y.Radai, David Ferbrache and Otto Stolz, this Catalog is now available
in a revised form. The goal is to describe all those features which a
(not too well-informed) user needs to analyse whether and what virus
may have reached his machine; moreover, the catalog should contain
some hints which established tools help him to erase the virus.
 
At this time, about 25 viruses (maybe some of which exist in German
locations have been catalogued. At the Virus Test Center of Hamburg
University/Informatics (with a group of students, who participate in
my 4-semester course on Computer Security), we have concentrated on
AMIGA and IBM PC viruses, but in the latter case, we have difficulties
to get virus code 1) because the German IBM PC virus scene doesnot
offer the internationally reported manifold, and 2) we refuse to
exchange viruses, like stamps (we also don't publish virus code or the
`dossiers' which we produced by reverse-engineering). We therefore
appreciate any help which we can get from competent and cooperative
experts in the field.
 
As a separat document I send:
                1st: the format of the Computer Virus Catalog,
                2nd: the index on entries at this time.
 
To minimize the transfer problems to `remote locations' (seen from a
Germanocentric world view), we try to find locations where the actual
entries may be invoked (e.g. in US). Moreover, in order to guarantee
some degree of completeness, we ask groups/persons with developped
knowledge in the field, to take on the task of adding information
about viruses not yet catalogued. We plan to establish a committee
which controls new or updated entries; while Y.Radai, and D.Ferbrache
have accepted to cooperate in this Virus Catalog Editorial Committee,
we hope for a few more experts to cooperate in this task.
 
Thank you in advance for comments.   Klaus Brunnstein.

(Remark: Out of the multiplicity of MSDOS viruses, only a few have
 in FRG; it is therefore difficult to receive copies for analysis)
 
 
5) Information Policy:
- ----------------------
5.1 Entries published in the Computer Virus Catalogue may be copied and
    edited if the original source ("Computer Virus Catalogue, Virus Test
    Center, University of Hamburg/Germany") is properly referenced and
    changes applied are mentioned.
 
5.2 Several "NoName" Viruses have been produced in or are known to Virus
    Test Center, Hamburg; such systems include MVS and VM, VMS and UNIX;
    moreover, viruses with different replication strategies in MSDOS and
    other PC systems have been tested. Since such "Test" viruses are
    only produced to analyse proper defense methods (which maybe needed
    in some future), it is the general information policy *not to dis-
    tribute further information*  in the Computer Virus Catalogue until
    such viruses appear in "real world".

Subject: Special ACM Issue on the Internet Worm
 
For those who aren't card-carrying members of ACM, the June issue of
"Communications of the ACM" (Vol 32, No. 6) is a special issue devoted
to articles on the now infamous Internet worm (the virus, not the person).
 
Articles include:
   The Worm Story
   The Internet Worm:  Crisis and Aftermath
   With Microscope and Tweezers:  The Worm from MIT's Perspective
   Password Cracking:  A Game of Wits
   The Cornell Commission:  On Morris and the Worm
 
Also, a column, "Legally Speaking," features an excellent discussion
titled "Can Hackers Be Sued for Damages Caused by Computer Viruses?"
Look for the issue with the Cootie Bug cover!
