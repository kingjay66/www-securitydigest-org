VIRUS-L Digest   Monday, 11 Sep 1989    Volume 2 : Issue 189

VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

  2) the printer prints spelling mistakes
  3) i see jumping ball on the screen (and it isnt the ping pong i checked)
  4) i cant boot the system

     A computer virus call "nVir" was discovered in early August after it
infested itself into a number of University department MacIntosh computer
systems.
     David Benson, Production manager for Student Publications, said the
virus has completely infected the computer system of the Publications
Building and is still active in the College of Communications and Rose
Administration Buildings.  Benson said the virus caused his computer to
break down and erase 1.5K hours of programming.

     Largin said he has approximately 200 disks of his own and noted
that the college had "hundreds and hundreds"
     The program Interferon is being used to track down the virus and
another called Vaccination is being used to treat the disks

Subject: Virus screening protocol?

I am trying to develop a protocol to insure that PC viruses are not
introduced into our site from outside.  Can anyone suggest what methods
are necessary and sufficient to keep viruses from being imported on
diskettes?  Are the same methods necessary for information received
electronically?

Thanks,
  Jim Blakley

Subject: October 12/13 virus attacks (PC)

Some bits of information on the Oct. 12/13 virus attacks.

DATACRIME will indeed attack on Oct. 12, but turning off your computer on
that day will not provide any protection against it. The first time an
infected program is run on Oct. 12 or after that date, the virus will
format the first few tracks of drive C: and then display the message:

        DATACRIME VIRUS RELEASED: 1 MARCH 1989

On a floppy-only computer it will do no damage at all. Two major
variants of Datacrime are known to exist, one is 1168 bytes long, the
other 1280.  Both variants only infect .COM files. This virus
originated in Europe, and is rare elsewhere. A new variant (Datacrime
II) has appeared recently), but little information is yet available on
it. Since I only received a copy of it yesterday I have not yet been
able to check if it will behave as the other two variants on Oct. 12.

The well-known Jerusalem virus will attack on October 13. So much has
been written about that virus that I see no need to repeat that
information here.

The South-African "Friday the 13." virus reported by Jim Goodwin will
attack on Oct. 13. This virus is very rare, and must not be confused
with the Jerusalem virus, that also has been named "Friday the 13.".
This virus will delete every program run on that date, and sometimes
display the message

        We hope we haven't inconvenienced you

This virus is not a great threat, since it is very rare - in fact it
is so rare that it took me almost four months to obtain a copy.

Recently a new virus was reported by the CVIA, which will probably
activate on Oct. 13. (At least they reported that the actvation date
was Friday 13.)  This virus (named the "RAP virus") has not yet been
described in detail.

One more "Friday the 13." virus is reported to exist, but it will not
become active until 1991. This is the SYS variant of the "Den Zuk"
virus.

Finally, two more viruses have been mentioned, with activation dates
on Oct 12/13.

>    A West German virus, apparently discussed at a hacker's convention
> in Amsterdam earlier this month, to be introduced through BITNET.
>    An enhanced version of an earlier Icelandic virus rewritten to avoid
> detection by constantly changing its location in memory."

This may be true, but so far I have not been able to confirm this.
These viruses - if they exist - are not likely to have spread widely,
and should not pose a serious threat.

Subject: NOCRIME version 1.1 now available (PC)

NOCRM11.UUE is now available.  The only difference it has from
version 0.1 is that it now discriminates the way DATACRIME viruses
discrimanate some files.
