Subject:  Administrative request to students
 
With the end of the semester approaching (already?!), I'd like to ask
all student subscribers who don't plan to be around over the summer to
unsubscribe from VIRUS-L before they leave for summer break.  It will
save me a great deal of effort.
 
To unsubscribe, send mail to LISTSERV@LEHIIBM1.BITNET (*NOT* to
VIRUS-L) saying "SIGNOFF VIRUS-L".  That's all there is to it.
 
Thanks in advance,
 
Ken

You say that the current version of Flushot+ is 1.52?  Thats interesting,
because I just downloaded a file called FLUSHOT2.ARC.  One wonders what
I've got.....(grin)  If you know, then let me in on it....  :-)
 
I keep trying to call his [Ross Greenberg's] BBS, but can never get a
connection.  I get connected, but thats all.  No "Enter your name...."
etc.  Perhaps someone can tell me my problem?  I'm calling from an
14.4K HST, 8N1, ANSI emulation and have (for his board) the baud rate
at 2400, &M0 and &K0.

Be careful here... "On a net" can mean various things.  Let's suppose
your PC is NFSed to some server that contains executable utilities.
Just because you practice "safe hex", it doesn't mean the guy who runs
the server does.  Hence, a utility that's a virus on the server can
infect your personal utilities.
 
Not only that, viruses can infect programs across networks as well as
worms can propogate through them.  The Internet situation was a worm
because the program propagated through Internet from machine to
machine.  It was not a worm merely because it existed on a network.
The program was self-contained and used utilies such as sendmail and
finger to spread.  If the program had modified the actual sendmail and
fingerd executables in such a way that they would in turn modify other
machines S&F executables, then it could be called a virus.

Subject: Virus-handling Policies or Procedures at Mainframe Sites?
 
Our network node, a mixture of IBM & DEC mainframes, is currently
working on a procedure dealing with what should be done if a "virus"
is discovered on one of our systems.  Do any other sites have a
similar document that they could share with us?  Any suggestions will
be appreciated.

Subject:      CheckSum Methods of Virus Detection (PC)
 
We have evaluated CHECKOUT, a fairly comprehensive and carefully
thought-out method of detecting viral enfection by performing a
sequence of pseudo random-block checksums on the files that you
specify.  It comes with documentation and sample EXECs that show you
how to protect the program itself from "CHECKOUT-aware" viruses.  So
far so good, BUT:
 
No check is made of the BOOT sector.  Which brings me to the following
questions:
 
1) Does anyone have a similar program that DOES checksum the BOOT sector in
   several sections?
 
2) (this may be scatterbrained on my part, but) Is there a robust and
   'proper' way of overlaying a read-only, "invisible" file over top of
   the BOOT sector?  I've had a hack at this myself with a disk editor
   (figuring I could write the code in C later, if I can just see HOW to
   string things together...)
 
Answers to either, and even explanations as to why I'm thinking along
the wrong lines completely will be appreciated.
