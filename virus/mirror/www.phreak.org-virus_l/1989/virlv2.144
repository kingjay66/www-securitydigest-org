 <ACSAZ@SEMASSU.BITNET> (Alex Z.) asks:

The current count is 9. Scores, nVIR (two strains and three clones -
MEV#, Hpat, and AIDS), INIT 29, Peace, and ANTI. Get a copy of my
virus doc stack from the LISTSERV at SCFVM; if you need help in doing
that, drop me some E-mail.
 
 Kenneth R. van Wyk <krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU> quotes Fred Cohen:

The virus portion is correct; it refers to the "Peace" virus. It was
distributed in a Trojan HyperCard stack. The anti-viral in question
is Vaccine, distributed by CE Software, *not* CompuServe. CIS did not
sponsor the development or distribution of this program; it was done
solely in a spirit of public service by Don Brown at CE Software.

Sounds Good.
 
Do they plan to make this software available to host sites on the Internet
such as SIMTEL20?

Subject: VIRUS ALERT: New Virus? (PC)
 
We were called for assistance in two virus cases today. Both seem to be
caused by the same virus.
Symptoms:
     COM Files grow by 50 Bytes
     Upon reboot the system will keep booting over and over again (till power
off)
Both incidents were not at our location so we will have to wait until paper
mail will get them through to us for further tests.
Sites of appearance:
   Rosenheim West-Germany (Bavaria)
   Ettlingen West-Germany (Baden)

Subject:     The "Mistake" Virus (PC)
 
  As some of you may already have read in the press, a new PC virus,
the "Mistake" virus, has been reported in Israel.  As I have already
been getting inquiries about it, I thought I might as well publish
what I know, even though I haven't yet seen it, so that what I report
here is second-hand info.
  Its main symptom is that certain characters in printouts are re-
placed by others.  In the case of letters, the replacement is always
by another letter which is pronounced similarly, e.g. K by C.  The
same thing happens with Hebrew letters (which on Israeli computers
replace the foreign letters at Ascii 128-154), making it almost
certain that the virus was authored by an Israeli.  Digits are also
replaced.  The virus has been reported in banks in Tel Aviv and at the
Univ. of Tel Aviv.  According to a newspaper report, the virus even
caused the Hebrew equivalent of the following sentence to be printed:
"4 times 4 equals 16, more or less" (there was no indication of what
the undistorted original was).  (Note: Replacements do not appear on
the screen or in files, only in printouts.)
  So much for the symptoms.  As to the mechanism, it's said to be a
boot-sector virus installing itself in 2K at the upper end of RAM.
It may be a mutation of the Ping-Pong (Italian) virus.  In any case it
has been removed by a program designed to remove the P-P virus.  As
with other boot-sector viruses, it could presumably be wiped out also
by performing SYS on the infected disk (immediately after a cold boot
from a clean DOS diskette).

This is my first time replying to the list, so be gentle with me :-)
Does the HomeBase BBS have a FidoNet node number, and if so does it
accept file requests?  Also, if you are giving info on a BBS, please
include the FidoNet node number if it has one.  Thanks in advance.

Subject:  virus detection program (PC)
 
I just read the message by Alan J. Roberts about a program that scans
a disk for the 53 known viruses. He also states that it is available
from the homebase BBS, which i unfortunately cannot call from here -
too expensive!  The adress he gave
(portal!cup.portal.com!Alan_J_Roberts@sun.COM) is too nonstandard for
my mailer, even gMAIL won't send my message, that's why i would like
to ask if anyone would be so kind to send me this program. It sounds
like the thing I was asking for in an issue of this digest a few weeks
back. I would be very grateful.
 
Also adding it to the listserv files or sending it to simtel-20 to be
added to <msdos.trojan.pro> sounds like the thing to do beause i think
a lot of people would be interested in this great program..
 
With thanks in advance, Rob J. Nauta.

Subject: Virus? Help!
 
My wife's office has gotten the following messages printed out on their
networked laserprinter.  She doesn't know which workstation on the Novell
network originated the printouts and no banners on printed documents are
used, so it is hard to track down.  In any case, the output included:
 
                      THE COPY BANDITO
              SAYS YOUR SYSTEM HAS BEEN INVADED BY
   STRANGE BEINGS WHO SEEK TO DISRUPT THE NORMAL LIFE ESSENSE
              PURVEYING YOUR PLACE OF WORSHIP.
               WHAT IS IT THAT YOU PRAY TO?
                IS ANYONE SMART ENOUGH?
 
 
                        TIMES UP!
                   !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
               !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 
                       BOW DOWN
 
              NO ONW [sic] HAS THE BRAINS
 
Has anyone seen this before?  Does anyone have an suggestions as to how to
track down which program contains this virus (if it is a virus)?
 
Thanks.  -- Eric

1. The English language has certain traditional ways of naming groups
of animals, e.g., a goggle of goblins, a school of fish, a pack of
wolves, etc.  Since both `virus' and `Trojan horse' have some kind of
animal overtones, I wonder what other people (preferably English
majors) think is a good way to name a group of those beasts.
Definitely not `diskful'---a disk is likely to be anything but full
after a visitation. A test-tube of viruses? A can of worms?  A pack of
Trojan horses? `This BBS offers a horde of Trojan Horses for
downloading.' Please reply directly to me, and I'll summarize in the
newsgroup.
 
2. Ross Greenberg is alleged to have written in Byte, June '89, page 275:
 
         >In the DOS environment, viruses use JMPs or other system files
         >to ply their trade.
 
I know that Ross knows that JMP is an instruction, not a system file.
Moral: check your proofs, or (c)Brain will infect every NOP in your system.

You're probably right.  The oldest versions of the System do not scan
the System folder for INIT (Startup), RDEV (Chooser), and cdev (Control
Panel) files;  INIT resources contained in these files will not be
executed.  GateKeeper and Vaccine are both cdev files.
 
You _might_ be able to install a hacked-up copy of Vaccine into the
System file on your startup disk(s).  You'd need to configure Vaccine
on a more-modern machine... probably "protection on, expert display,
don't compile MPW INITs, don't show icon at startup".  Then, use
ResEdit to copy the INIT and FKDT resources from the configured copy of
Vaccine, and paste them into the System file on your startup floppy.
You could also try configuring the copy of Vaccine to display its icon
at startup time;  you'd then need to copy the ICN# resource from the
Vaccine file and add it to the System.
 
I haven't tried this and can't assure you that it would work... but it's
probably worth a try.  Do it on _copies_ of Vaccine and of your startup
floppy, of course!  Best of luck!
 
Dave,
Thanks for the above. I tried it and although all the copying and pasting
via ResEdit worked OK, no joy when I booted up with the new system. The
Vaccine icon didn't appear and re-infection occurred when I used an infected
disk on the machine. I have an application called "Immunity" which is supposed
to protect the System file from re-infection by inserting nVir=10 code into
the resource fork of the sytem file. It doesn't seem to insert it into other
files that could be infected eg. Finder, MacWrite, MacPaint etc. Could I use
ResEdit to copy the nVir=10 code and paste it into the other files/
applications? Rgds, Iain Noble
