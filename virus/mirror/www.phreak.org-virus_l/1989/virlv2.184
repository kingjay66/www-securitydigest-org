VIRUS-L Digest   Friday,  1 Sep 1989    Volume 2 : Issue 184
 
VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

I think this is the way to go for simple psychological reasons.
Naming a virus for its discoverer is a strong discouragement to the
virus writers.  Imagine the frustration of writing what you think is a
really nifty virus, only to have someone else's name associated with
it.  Not much incentive there.
 
There's more than one way to fight this war.

Subject: re: Virus Report from Brazil
 
Does this imply that the Lehigh virus has been seen in Brazil?  That's
certainly news if so; first I've heard of it being anywhere outside
Lehigh.  Given the destructiveness of this virus, if it's gotten into
the World at Large, that'd be worth knowing for sure.  Did the article
give any more details and/or has anyone else heard of the Lehigh virus
spreading beyond Lehigh?

[Ed. I'm not aware of either Lehigh virus having infected anything
outside of the Lehigh University campus.]

Has anyone out there ever heard anything of a "Columbus Day" virus?
If it exists at all (and I have no proof that it does), then it
doesn't appear to have been discussed on VIRUS-L.  If anyone can
substantiate, one way or the other, the existence of this virus,
please email me and I'll summarize to the list.  Thanks.

HI, there.
 
I 'm a college student studying physics.  Now I have discovered a
suspicious thing about MS-DOS's behavior in my sense. When I copy some
files to a floppy but I misput a write protected diskette, I find the
error massage "retry, ...". At this time, if I answer "r" to the
massage and puting a non-protected diskette, then the FAT and
DIRECTORY of the protected diskette is transfered to the second non
protected diskette(and the files that I copied to). Is this a DOS's
bug or a virus?
 
I look forward to the help from anybody.
 
Thank you.
