Subject: virus sociology
 
     I've been reading this newsgroup for a while now, and have come
to speculate about whether or not the situation is going to become
self-perpetuating.  That is, I'm sure that the human scum who write
viri are doing so for the same reasons that any act of vandalism is
committed.  The motivations of attention getting and of maliciously
hurting innocent (and often unknown) people are common to all vandals.
 
     The question is: can we speculate that many, if not most, of this
scum reads (and perhaps participates) in this newsgroup?  Isn't the
effort of cataloging all the viri egging the scum on to greater
efforts?
 
     The next question is: how much effort should we be putting into
getting the vendors of various machines and operating systems to
design their software to be virus-proof as opposed to writing new
virus detectors/fixers?  Let's face it, the current generation of
personal computers have non-existant security not only from viri but
also from user screwups.

(GAO/IMTEC-89-57) is the first U.S. General Accounting Office report that
has been made available on a wide-area computer network.  The report is
particularly relevant to Internet users -- it examines Internet security
and vulnerability to issues and factors relating to the the prosecution of
virus crimes.

Subject: the CHRISTMA EXEC on BITNET and VNET (IBM VM/CMS)
 
At the time of the CHRISTMA EXEC I was a student mainframe consultant.
and I don't recall BITNET being crippled by this program.
 
2 copies of the program were sent to my reader and i just ignored
them.  Later when I had the time to look at them I went to my reader and
Voila, they were gone!  I asked my boss what happened to the files.
He ran a program that went thru the system and removed all copies of
the program from every one's reader and minidisk.  He took this a bit
further by having RSCS ( VM's communication server ) purge all files
going though our node named CHRISTMA EXEC.
 
I've heard that VNET was crippled by the CHRISTMA EXEC.
I've heard that IBM actually had to shut down
thier RSCS servers and then purge the files from each machine.
They have since done 2 things ( that I know of) to prevent future
instances.
 
First off, when one receives an EXEC from their reader
the filetype is changed from EXEC to CEXE to prevent execution
of the program.
Secondly, it is now very hard to get files/mail into VNET.
I've been trying for sometime to find a route for BITNET<->VNET
and haven't been successful. (( any help with this would be greatly
appreciated!! ))
 
As a sidebar, the reason I think the 2 nets were effected differently
is because these nets are used differently.  On BITNET most nodes are
primarily used for 'things' other than E-Mail.  So when the RSCS servers
started using too much CPU time, systems people got curious and found
out what was happening. IBM on the other hand uses VNET primarily for
E-Mail and with 300,000+ people (my guess) using E-Mail one would expect
RSCS to suck a lot of the systems resources.
This made it less obvious and the longer the CHRISTMA EXEC went
unchecked the harder it was going to be to eradicate.

B) I've been wrong before

Subject: resource fork viruses (Apple II)
 
The Apple II GS OS is about to incorporate resource forks, something I
understand has been in the MAC OS forever.  I also note from all the
traffic that almost all the MAC viruses seem to have something to do
with resource forks.  (sounds to me like the virus writers aren't very
inventive; any bad guy worth his salt would bypass ALL the vendor's
software and play with the bare metal -- but since the IBM crowd ain't
much smarter I guess we just don't have the hackers like we used to)
Anyway, could someone summarize for me what the MAC resource forks are
used for (since I know essentially nothing about MAC-land) and how they
are or are not more vulnerable to virus/trojan horse penetration than
"conventional" file structures as found in IBM-land or the more earlier
Apple II DOS and ProDos-land?

Subject: Re:What kind of virus is this ? (PC)
 
If I am not wrong, it is the Ping-pong virus ( also known as the Bouncing
ball virus). I remove the virus by first copy the original boot record (
it is stored in one of the bad sectors marked by the virus) back to the
boot sector and then erase the content in the two bad sectors.
 
Yeo Y.T.
 
Plus: I always boot-up the system with a 'clean' DOS before I make any
changes. Otherwise the virus will remain active in the RAM if you boot-up
with an infected disks. You will not be able to remove the virus even
though you format your disk.

Thanx for your praise Holly!  I didn't think I'd become famous when
I wrote the stack.  The latest version (dated 6/8/89 on the
disclaimer card) is available on GEnie.  I haven't uploaded it to
Compuserve yet, so the latest version there is only 3/31/89.  I also
upload it to The Rest of Us BBS here in Chicago (when it's up!).
Since it gets downloaded quite a lot, people put it elsewhere too.
I've seen it on HomeBase BBS in CA, someone sent me mail that they
got it off a BBS in Denver, I've even seen it on an archive list
from the U.K.!!
 
If you want to be sure you have the latest version:  check the Date
Modified on the Disclaimer card.  First Version: 1/22/89, second:
3/31/89, third and latest: 6/8/89.  Of course I'm continually
working on it so I'll probably release another version soon.

Subject: Ping Pong Virus (PC)
 
Hans Varkevisser described what appears to be the Ping Pong virus and asks
if there is any way to deal with it short of a low level format.  The Ping
Pong (Italian) is a boot infector and can be removed with McAfee's MDISK
programs.  The CVIA is distributing these programs free of charge (with
proof of infection) to anyone infected with a boot or partition table virus.
They've been tested against all the viruses we know about and work flawlessly
against all boot and partition table viruses.
    Contact the CVIA at 408 727 4559 or page SysOp on HomeBase at
408 988 4004 to get these programs.

Subject: safeware (PC)
 
perhaps you remember my mentioning safeware several weeks ago.
we have been doing some testing and thought you might like to
know the results.
we tested safeinfo and several other safeware products on what
has now been identified as the jerusalem virus and several other
viral strains.
in each case, safeware detected that some change had been made in
the file since it had been compiled and notified me.
safeware runs a proprietary selftest (tm) module as soon as the
program is loaded.
execution is immediately halted if a change is detected in file
length, crc or both.
safeinfo.arc can be downloaded from (201) 473-1991 if you would
like to check it out. also viruscan can be downloaded from
(201) 249-1898. the first number is a 10 line tbbs so there is
almost never a busy signal.
 
i spoke to the author of safeware and he assures me neither safeware
nor the selftest module will ever be sold or allowed to be used by
a commercial software house.
 
he seems to be quite proud of the fact that safeware was written
and released by a shareware author. in fact when you think about it
it is quite amazing that commercial houses have not yet released
such a product, and it took a shareware author to do it first!
 
he also assures me that the code can be changed and programs
recompiled in less than 5 minutes if the need arises. it seems there
are several versions of the selftest module and only one has been
released in shareware so far.
 
in any event, the built in protection safeware offers works, and
there are now more than 25 programs released under the safeware
label.
 
almost forgot, we are working on getting copies of all the safeware
products. if we can get them, does anyone know where we can post
them for requests? we do not have a listserv here, so it would
be kind of hard.
 
any suggestions would be appreciated.

Subject: Still on viruscan (PC)
 
Mr. Alan Robertson sent me a message and pointed out to me that
the problem I had with VIRUSCAN and multiple scans was due to the
hardware and not a software problem.  He thinks that about 1% of
IBM clones suffer from this and it so happend that both the machines
I have used (COMMODORE PC20 & AMSTRAD 1640) fall into that 1%.  I have
now tried a copy of the new version of SCAN and find that the problem
does not occur any more.

Actually given RPC's(Remote Procedure calls) and other given holes in
present lan systems they are as vunerable as any non-protected system
nowadays!!  My vote would have to be yes lets cover these issues also
I just hope the vendors are listening!!

          Last week someone asked for inputs about the VIRUSCAN program and
          whether or not it had actually identified any viruses. The
          following log is an actual log by VIRUSCAN against viruses I have
          collected for taxonomy purposes. VIRUSCAN correctly identified
          the Virus and strain involved. At present in the log are the
          strains of EXE and com infectors I have gathered and will be
          testing the boot and partition infectors sometime this week. I
