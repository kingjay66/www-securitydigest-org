Subject: How can I get SCANV3x ???


Could some kind soul please tell me where I can get a copy of the
SCANV program (or send it to me, if, as I believe, it is shareware)?
I have been trying to call the BBS at (408)988-4004 with no success,
and the more I read about the viri which are out there the more
apprehensive I am getting. I don't, by the way, have access to
Compuserve.

Thanks in advance,

Subject: paper comparing biological and computer viruses

    This is an outline for a semi-serious paper on the similarities
between biological and computer viruses, and the efforts to understand
and combat them.  I present it here in the hopes that others may wish
to contribute a paragraph or so (sorry no money, but I'll give credit
for any material I receive).

    Loosely termed, a virus is a "piece of information" that
replicates itself by using it's host's own machinery.  Methods of
entry into the host system are various.  The infection often has a
latency period that differs from one species of virus to another.
They may, in fact, appear to be entirely benign.  Viruses often "hide"
in specific parts of the infected system, sometimes multiplying there,
sometimes completely dormant, until some external event triggers the
onset of the symptoms.

    Concerning the effort to understand and combat biological and
computer viruses; there are also many correspondences between the
identification, classification, taxonomy, evolutionary theory and
epidemiology of the two disciplines.

    Often in reading the network discussion list "VIRUS-L", I am
struck by the familiarity (my own background is biology) of the
arguments that have arisen about:

- -  How best to identify a new virus,
- -  What to name it,
- -  When it started,
- -  Where it originated,
- -  It's relation to other viruses,
- -  The possible evolutionary path,
- -  What methods of infection there are,
- -  The ways a virus can combat detection and defences,
- -  How quickly it spreads,
- -  The percentage of the host population that is infected,
- -  What the latency period is, and how the onset of symptoms are triggered.

    The only absolutely sure way to understand the virus is to dis-
assemble it into it's component parts, and read the code.
Unfortunately, we are only recently able to disassemble the simplest
of the biological virus, and the ability to understand all of the
approximately 10K instructions of that simple virus is many years
away.

What other analogies can you see?    Can you expand on any of the above?

Stretching things just a little bit further, there are analogies between:

Although I haven't gotten my feet too wet with the administrative functions
of the Army, as far as I can tell:

        a.  In the combat service support branches, e.g.:  Adjutant General
            Finance Corps, etc., the only C.O.A. for dealing with system
            malfunctions is to call the programmers in.

        b.  On the combat support level, e.g.:  branches like Air Defense
            Artillery may operate with safeguards and procedures when dealing
            with viruses.  Considering that it is equipment that safeguards
            our nation's defense, one would HOPE that it is resistant to
            viruses.  But, more than anything else, I have a feeling that
            it's relegated to the knowledgable computer operators to resolve
            problems with the systems.

        c.  Combat Arms branches, e.g.:  Infantry, Artillery, and Armor, don't
            do a lot with computer systems except on the unit level.  (Within
            individual tanks, or on the platoon level for troop movement, etc.)
            The level to which it is prone to viruses is, in my estimation,
            minimal, and the ease by which the components can be replaced takes
            away the risk.

If anyone knows more about the Army's Plan on Viruses, please post!  I'd be
interested to learn about it.

   Air Defense is a combat arms branch.  Signal, Military Police,
Military Intelligence, and Chemical Corps are service.

   Overall DOD has done little or anything.  They were one of the last
to know about the worm incident.  They care more about administrative
security than real security issues.  (My opinion only!)

Subject: Jerusalem virus infection, query (PC)

The PC lab at the Engineering Computer Network, University of
Oklahoma, has detected multiple virus infections (mostly Jerusalem
virus) on its PCs.  The viruses were found and removed with Unvirus,
with thanks to its authors.

However, I would like to find some programs which would detect and
remove more than 7 viruses.  Any information regarding anti-viral
archive sites, anti-viral programs, and documentation would be greatly
appreciated.

Also, how many viruses have been identified, and which are the largest
threats to security in the United States of America?

Thank you

Subject: New virus? (Mac)

We here at the University of Rochester may have discovered a new
virus, or a variation on a theme.  What it does is infect Macwrite and
the Chooser, so that when a document is printed, Macwrite crashes.
The virus changes the name to Macwight or Macwite, but this is the
only clue so far.  I am trying to get more data, more none is
forthcoming.  I will do what i can today and tommorrow, and give
furthr reports.  Disinfectant 1.1 doesn't work, so please email me the
latest version of disinfectant to try.  The sooner the better, because
the Vice-Provost's office is infected, and they may lose a 75 page
report for the government.  (What, no backups?  What do you think.
Argh.)

Subject: Followup on new virus (Mac)

This is a followup to my earilier report.  I will try to give more
details from my and others investigations.

The virus definatly attacks Macwrite.  It adds a str ID 801 and
modifies the icon to say Macwite instead of the standard application
icon.  The application increases in size by 104 bytes, 56 in the
string.  they are added in sector 014F, according to Fedit Plus 1.0.

It also attacks the system, in an unknown fashion.  I was able to
induce it to do something by repeated Get Infos.  This may be a
counter towards a more fatal outcome.  Some of the disks have crashed
after giving the This is not a Macintosh disk.  Shall I initialize it?
warning.  This happens almost immediatly after attempts to print.

The chooser is unable to find printer resources, and claims there are
none.  When the File locked, Lock, Bozo and File Protect bits are set,
the virus apparently cannot infect.  It doesn't appear able to attack
a disk write protected by the corner tab, either.  Tommorrow I will be
performing further experimenets, and will upload exact locations for
the added code, and probably the string listing, too.  No anti-virus
program has been able to find it, including Interferon, Virus Rx,
Anti-pan, and Disinfectant 1.2.  If this is recognized by anyone,
please email me ASAP at the address below with devirusing help.  If
not, I will try to do everything I can.  Thank you for your time and
effort.

Yes, there's probably enough interest to warrant posting the program.

But will you be able to keep it current, and get the current version to
registered users as fast as the virus?

Subject: Virus Protection

It seems to me that this whole problem will be largely solved when and
only when the vendors all start "signing" their software with a
digital signature based on public key cryptography.  At least then any
one who wishes to check a program for authenticity need only check to
see that it passes the digital signature check with the alleged
vendor's public key.  Of course you also have to know that the
checking program hasn't been tampered with, the hardware hasn't been
tampered with, etc., etc., but at least we would have a starting point
for software authentication.

The signature approach and the use of signature checking seem to me
the only way to make definitive progress against viruses.  All other
approaches are dependent on details of the viruses code, which as we
have seen change with time and with each new virus.  Digital
signatures will let us check that at least a trusted source has put
its signature on the code, and that it has not been altered since
then.  Software developers will then have to get serious about
preventing viruses from creeping in at the factory if they are not
already serious.

If members of the appropriate software standards body are listening, I
hope they give consideration to such a standard ASAP.  The standard
should allow for both existing and future developers as well as private
individuals (hobbyists who may develop freeware) to have a unique public
key.  Then software users who neglect to check the signature use the
software at their own risk, but if they experience damage and can prove
it, they will be in a position to apply some heat to the vendor who
provided the signed, but infected, software.

The ideal way to implement checking would be to build it into the
loader.  This may become feasible if a worldwide standard is adopted.
Meanwhile checking could be implemented in a way which did not require
ROM modifications.  The standard could provide for inclusion of the
vendor's public key and the resulting signature in the format of any
loadable file.

Subject: Flushot+ and Artic speech package (PC)

  I am new to this list, and don't know much abot various anti-viral
programs for the IBM - but I have run into some problems I think may
be caused by one of them.  In our labs, I am setting up a workstation
for visually impaired - the major role plays there a package called
ARTIC - hardware/software driven speech synthesizer.  Part of that
program is a memory-resident code which can intercept any program, and
provide support for ARTIC's hardware from within.  This way, one can
have the machine read the screen, or just read the key combinations,
etc.  Now, on the same drive I have installed Flushot+ (students have
access to the station).  I am not familiar with Flushot or Flushot+,
so I can't tell what is happening: at all times, there is a '+' in the
top right corner of the screen, and some of the functions of ARTIC are
for some reason disabled.  I dug through ARTIC's manuals - there is no
mention of anything which could explain the situation..  Anyone out
there - PLEASE tell me whether it is Flushot intefering with ARTIC
here (I suspect '+' signifies something!)  or am I looking in the
wrong direction...  If anyone out there has used ARTIC business
version - and knows of an anti-virus which will not react to ARTIC's
software - please let me know..!
Thanks - Yahn.

The NIST paper was written by two staff members there, and is not a
committee report.  I've received some feedback from NIST on my
comments to the effect of "Good point.  We did not intend the bias
towards commercial software, but it is certainly there".

Subject: RE: Tiger Teams

Another thought on the Tiger Teams...  It doesn't make much sense to me.
If I don't add any new software to my system at work, I'm not going to
worry about viruses.  Say I get my new system, put all the software on
it, and run a few virus scanners that turn up nothing.  I then run all
applications from my hard drive, and don't use any floppy disks.  It
wouldn't make sense for me to check my hard drive every day for viruses,
because they don't just pop up from nowhere.

If I did add software to my system, I would check it for viruses before
adding it.  I think it would make more sense for the Tiger Teams to come
in in the middle of the day, ask you to please save your work, and then
run a virus checker on your system.  If anything is found, you are
"cited" as letting a virus into your system.  If you're clean, you go
back to work, and the Tiger Team moves on.
