Greetings to all!
   To all the people who have contributed answers to an unfortunate
common problem, thanks, I needed that! But anyway, I am planning on
purchasing a HD (71mb) and would like some suggestions as to how I can
spot a virus (or potential one), and if dreadfully, I do encounter
one, what can I do short of erasing all the data.
   The viruses I speak of are the kind that wind up on the boot
sector, and those that work on COM and EXE files. Do the viruses stay
resident on one area of the Hard Disk, or do they move around?  (copy
itself to other partitions, and/or subdirectories).
 
          Thanks for any info/answers!

Under the expectation that by "reliable" you mean "successfully detect
a virus", Virus Detective is very reliable for detecting MacMag/Peace,
nVIR/Hpat (and I suspect the AIDS variant of nVIR), Scores, Init 29,
and ANTI.  In order to detect the latter two viruses, you will need
version 2.1.1.
 
For eradication, you will either have to do this manually, or obtain
another product (a recent one that holds alot of promise is
Disinfectent.  Refer to the March 30 Virus-L digest for the details on
it).
 
Virus Detective 2.1.1 and Disenfectant 1.0 are both archived by the
InfoMAC people.  I suggest you ask there for details on how to
transfer these utilities to your local machine.

Subject: Something to ponder...
 
I've been doing some research on viruses here at the office and I
thought struck me, perhaps someone on InfoMAC or Virus-L can
contribute something to this:
 
The Brain virus that afflicts MS-DOS systems has the capability to
infect the bootstrap code on a floppy disk.  This makes it a
particularly nasty virus because a "warm restart" will not cause the
virus to go away; it will still be in the bootstrap code that is kept
in RAM.
 
My question is this: Why can't the bootstrap code on tracks 0 and 1 of
a Mac disk be infected?  Would Vaccine prevent such an infection?
 
My suspected answers are (1) it can be done and (2) no, Vaccine would
be totally ineffective against it.
 
If my suspicions are indeed correct, how likely is it that Don Brown
could be persuaded to update Vaccine to prevent this?
