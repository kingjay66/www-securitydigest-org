    Attn: Joe McMahon
 
Joe, I do have trouble accessing archives.  I also have trouble trying to
send you e-mail.  Anyway, I am on VAX/VMS withOUT Netmbx (can't send
interactives) and would like some serious HELP regarding your virus list
and retreiving archived files.
 
                        thanks,
                                   Alex Z... . .  .

Oops, the posting was truncated somehow.  Here is the rest:
 
- -----------------------------------------------------------
 
All email regarding this list should be sent to:
 
security-request@cpd.com (INTERNET sites)
uunet!zardoz!security-request (UUCP sites)
 
Please be patient, I answer all requests, but I receive hundreds of
letters a week.  If you don't receive an answer after a reasonable
amount of time (2 or 3 weeks), send another request, in case the
previous one was eaten by an email monster 8<).

Subject: virus interviews
 
A Mr. Atsushi Tanaka is visiting me today from Japan, interviewing me for
Nikkei Computer Magazine.  He will be in the San Francisco area July 11 &
July 13, and wishes to meet with people involved in anti-virus and computer
security activities on a wide variety of machines from Micros to Mainframes.
 
If anyone is interested and can spend some time doing an interview, please
send me mail at the below address, including phone number, and I'll pass
the information on to Tanaka-san.
 
Thanks in advance,

Subject: query re: VIRUSCAN program availability (PC)
 
Hello,
in VIRUS-L of Jun 28, 1989 Alan J.Roberts mentioned a program called
VIRUSCAN for the IBM PC. I would like to get this program, but I don't know
how. Could someone, if possible, mail me a uuencoded ARC-file ?
   Thank you,
     Rainer Kleinrensing (RAINER at DBNUAMA1 in BITNET)

Subject: Traceback virus (IBM PC)
 
There has been a new virus for the IBM PC detected in the UK, this
virus is known as the Traceback virus. The following description is
from material supplied by the British Computer Virus Research Centre.
 
                     Traceback
 
Category: Memory resident, Non-overwriting .COM/.EXE infector
 
Characteristic file extension: 3066 bytes
 
Description:
 
When an infected binary is executed the virus installs itself in memory,
thereafter any program executed will be infected by the virus. This is the
indirect infection mode.
 
Additionally each time the virus is executed, if the date is after 5th Dec
1988, it will infect one .com or .exe file in the current directory, failing
which it will search the entire directory structure commencing at the root for
a candidate. The search process will terminate if an infected file is
encountered prior to infection taking place.
 
The name traceback derives from the fact that each infected copy of the
virus contains the directory path of the file causing the infection. It is
thus possible to trace an infection back through a number of files.
 
Symptoms:
 
If the date is after the 28th Dec 1988 the virus will produce a screen
display similar to the cascade virus (ie letters will detach from their
position on the screen and fall downwards until striking another letter).
This display occurs one hour after infection. During the display sequence
any keystrokes will cause a system lockup. Following the character descent
the user may restore each character to its original position. Each time
the user types a keystroke one character will be restored to its
original position (depressions of the same key twice are ignored). The
screen display will nevertheless restore itself after 1 minute. The
cascade and restore are repeated at one hour intervals.
