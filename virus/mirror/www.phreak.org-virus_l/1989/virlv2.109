Subject: Anti-viral archive sites (long)
 
[Ed. For those who may not be aware, Jim was instrumental in setting
up comp.virus on the Usenet side of things.  He's also coordinated the
creation of various archive sites for VIRUS-L/comp.virus.  We're all
in his debt for his tremendous efforts.  Thanks, Jim!]
 
What follows is the official announcement of the anti-viral archive
system.  This has been set up in conjunction with the formation of
comp.virus.  We hope that this will provide everyone with access to
all of the virus-fighting tools available in the public domain and
as shareware.
 
I will guarantee that even at the time I post this, the list is
out of date.  The final word on what is and isn't available at each
site is to actually look and see.  However, this list should give
you a good idea how things sit now.
 
To truly make this work, we need the help of you, the users.  While
we have tried to collect all the tools possible, there are undoubtedly
omissions.  If you know of an anti-viral tool that does not appear
on our list, you can help out.  Send me a mail message indicating
what the tool is, the version number is, and HOW TO CONTACT THE AUTHOR.
I'll try to coordinate this all, at least while I'm still here at
Iowa State.  If you prefer, you can send mail directly to the site
coordinators.  But remember, they are doing this as a service; they
all have "real work" to do.  :-)  So be kind.
 
Also, if any site would like to volunteer their services and join
the anti-viral archive system, send mail to me.  We are particularly
looking for sites to share the IBM-PC load.

>OK, what I'm going to do is create a directory "pub/virus" in our anonymous

>virus directory.  Since I moderate both those groups, the best way to get
