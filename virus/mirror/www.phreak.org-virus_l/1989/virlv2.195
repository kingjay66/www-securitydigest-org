              "Computer Virus Sparks a User Scare"
  "Some Analysts Say the 'Friday the 13th' Fears Are Overblown"
                         by John Burgess
               Washington Post, Sep 17 1989, pg H3

     A computer "virus" that springs to life destructively on
Friday the 13th is on the loose, and across the country computer
users are rushing helter-skelter to protect their machines
against it.
     Yet, with fewer than 10 verified sightings in a country with
tens of millions of computers, some experts are saying the threat
is being absurdly overblown.
     "At this point, the panic seems to have been more
destructive than the virus itself," said Kenneth R. Van Wyk, a
security specialist at Carnegie-Mellon University's Software
Engineering Institute.  He has been taking 20 phone calls a day
for advice on the subject.
     Written as pranks or tools of sabotage, viruses are software
programs designed to spread surreptitiously through computer
interconnections and the exchange of the floppy magnetic storage
disks on which computer programs and data are recorded.
     Once introduced into a machine, they transmit their own
instructions to the computer, causing it to destroy data or
display a surprise message on the screen.
     The new one is known variously as the Datacrime, Columbus
Day, and Friday the 13th virus.  Aimed at IBM-compatible personal
computers, it is designed to lie dormant and unnoticed in a
machine until Oct. 13, a Friday, and then activate as soon as an
unwitting user turns on the machine and "executes" a program.
(Many computers have internal calendars that make such
date-activated instructions possible.)
     At that time, a message flashes on the screen:

                        DATACRIME VIRUS.
                     RELEASED 1 MARCH 1989.

     Simultaneously, the virus erases a section of the machine's
disk storage unit that serves as an index to the information on
the disk [the FAT].  People with something more than basic
technical knowledge can fix the problem and recover the data,
however.
     The federal government views viruses as a grave threat to
the nation's information systems and has set in motion special
programs to guard computers against them and to punish people who
introduce them.
     The phenomenon received widespread public attention last
fall, when a virus written by a Cornell University graduate
student swept through the federally supported Internet research
network, replicating itself automatically over and over and
temporarily tying up 6,000 machines in one day.
     The Datacrime virus, however, is targeted at computers that
for the most part are not linked in networks.
     And it comes at a time when publicity has led many users to
take the basic precautions of "safe computing," avoiding free
software that is posted on bulletin boards, where the viruses may
lurk, and using only programs that come in factory-sealed
containers.
     The Software Engineering Institute knows of fewer than 10
cases, Van Wyk said.
     International Business Machines Corp. said Thursday is it
not directly aware of any.  "If it was out there in any number,"
said Bill Vance, director of secure systems for IBM, "it would be
spreading and be more noticeable."  October 13, he said, is not
likely to be "a major event."
     At Centel Federal Systems of Reston, however, a different
mood prevails.  It has been operating a toll-free hotline on the
virus, with six people working full-time.  It has received more
than 1,000 calls, according to Tom Patterson, senior analyst for
security operations at the federal systems unit, which is owned
by independent telephone company Centel Corp. of Chicago.
     Patterson said he began working on the virus about five
weeks ago, after receiving a tip from an acquaintance in Europe
that hackers there were planning to modify an existing virus and,
by dialing up electronic bulletin boards across the Atlantic,
release it in this country.
     Subsequent investigation turned up specimens in this country
fitting the description he had received.  Patterson said he had
dissected a version of it and, in tests, found that it could
penetrate a number of software products that are supposed to keep
viruses out.  In recent days, he found one on the machines of a
Centel client.  "The virus is out there," Patterson said.  "It's
real."
     Also active in the campaign is John McAfee, a
virus-protection specialist based in Santa Clara, Calif., who
runs a bulletin board on which he offers anti-viral programs.
His phone line has been constantly busy in recent days.
     Concern has heightened with each new report of the virus in
the computer trade press and on at least one wire service, the
Associated Press, leading some security specialists to see the
panic as a self-fulfilling prophecy by the media.
     Others wonder whether companies that make anti-viral
products are not happy to see the scare being pumped up.
     "The more panicked people get," said Jude Franklin, general
manager of Planning Research Corp.'s technology division, "the
more people who have solutions are going to make money."
     For $25, which it says is necessary to cover the cost of a
disc, shipping, and handling, Centel is offering software written
by McAfee that searches for the virus.
     Patterson said Centel would be losing money on the discs [!]
but is doing it anyway.  "I'm not trying to hype this," he said.
"I'm working 20-hour days...  to get the word out."

  The facts reported by David are correct, except that the first ver-
sion infects every *second* EXE file executed instead of every tenth
one.

  Btw, though it was originally reported that the Saratoga was disco-
vered "some months earlier" than the first Icelandic virus, it later
turned out that the Saratoga is actually a hack of Icelandic-1.

  Since I recently tried to clarify for myself the same question which
David raises, I can present the following table summarizing the main
differences between the versions:

Version:                  Saratoga       Icelandic-1       Icelandic-2
                          --------       -----------       -----------
File length increase(*):       642               656               632
Infects 1 file out of every      2                10                10
DOS services via interrupts?   Yes               Yes                No
Marks a cluster as bad?        Yes               Yes                No
Checks Int 13h Segment?         No               Yes                No
Signature(**):                PooT       18 44 19 5F       18 44 19 5F
First appearance:          July 89    June (Feb?) 89           July 89

(*)  The total length is rounded up to the next higher multiple of 16,
if necessary.  (This happens with *any* EXE-infecting virus.)
(**) This is the last 4 bytes of the virus (used to determine if a
file is already infected).

  I consider the bypassing of interrupts which Icelandic-2 performs
to be very significant.  I think ARC513.EXE (a hacked version of SEA's
ARC) also did this, but it was a Trojan, not a virus.  Among viruses,
I heard of a strain of the Jerusalem virus which infects by direct
BIOS access instead of by Int 21, though I'm not sure if that strain
ever spread publicly.  At least one version of the Vienna virus (not
the one in Ralf Burger's book) is worthy of mention here since it
overwrites 1 out of 8 files with code containing a far jump to the
BIOS initialization routine.  Have I forgotten any cases?
  The important thing about all this is that although the spreading of
such viruses has been predicted for a long time, the authors of most
monitoring programs, such as FluShot+, have either failed to find a
solution or have ignored these predictions entirely.  As far as I
know, there is only one program so far which can stop such viruses and
Trojans, and that is Fridrik Skulason's F-LOCK.  If anyone knows of
any other such program, I'd like to hear of it.

I'm the editor of our university's computing newletter.  I need to
know how users can detect the October 12/13 virus ahead of time.  Is
there a way at all?  I don't want to alarm users, but I feel they
should know about the possible existence of this problem.

Thanks.

[Ed. In VIRUS-L volume 2 issue 192, Charles M. Preston
<portal!cup.portal.com!cpreston@sun.com> states that a) Viruscan V36
can detect Datacrime and that b) Datacrime can be identified by the
hex string EB00B40ECD21B4 (1168 version) or 00568DB43005CD21 (1280
version).  Note that a hex string search can be done via the DEBUG 'S'
command (e.g., "S CS:100 FFFF hex_string" at the DEBUG prompt), if
my memory of MS-DOS is correct.]

Has anyone used VirusDetective for the Mac?  We've
used it, but it seems to detect viruses in files that
we doubt are affected.

How reliable is this bit of software?

Interesting that a new virus ("3555") should show up so soon after the
stories about the alleged Datacrime attack, set for Oct. 13.,
especially one that has some resemblence to Datacrime.

BTW, the Washington Post ran an article on Computer Viruses in
yesterday's Business section.  Ken Van Wyk is quoted extensively,
which probably accounts for the article's general sanity (vis-a-vis
some "Sky is falling" type articles).

Subject: TYPO vs. Ping-Pong (PC)

I just finished examining the Typo virus. This virus is rather new - it
was first detected in Israel this summer. It creates errors in printouts,
by (sometimes) replacing some characters or digits.

    (By the way - a surprisingly large number of viruses seems to have
    originated in Israel.  First to arrive were the two versions of the
    April 1. virus (sURIV 1.0 and sURIV 2.0) that later were merged into
    one virus, (sURIV 3.0) which evolved into the well-known Jerusalem
    virus (sUMsDos) variant. That virus was then used as a basis for the
    "Fu Manchu" virus.

    Later the two boot sector viruses, Typo and SWAP, arrived.

    Finally, just a few days ago a new virus, MIX1 was reported.

Anyhow - as has been reported before (Y. Radai and others) the TYPO virus
is closely related to the Ping-Pong or "Italian" virus, which is one of
the most common viruses around.

In fact, the viruses are so similar that some anti-virus programs even
identified Typo as the Italian virus. This is not so surprising, since the
boot sectors are almost identical. Almost - but not quite. The differences
between the boot sectors are:

    Some local variables have been moved. For example, the word
    containing the location of the original boot sector is now located
    two bytes earlier than before.

    The signature (two bytes that the virus uses to see if a diskette
    has already been infected) has been changed.

    The activation times have been changed. Ping-Pong had an "activation
    window" (a second or so long) every half hour. Typo will become
    active 112.5 seconds after power-on, and will stay active most of
    the time.

The major differences between the two viruses are in the other part of the
virus code, which is not stored in the boot sector, but in the cluster the
viruses mark as "bad" in the FAT.

Of course, there are quite a few interesting things the viruses have in
common.

    Typo contains the same "bug" as Ping-Pong does, that prevents it
    from working on '286 and '386 machines.

    It is possible to remove Typo with some programs designed to
    remove Ping-Pong.

Since the signature is stored in the same place on both viruses, it is
possible to inoculate diskettes against one of them, but not both.

Danish TV (Channel 2) had a brief report on the October 13 virus in
the evening news yesterday. It has obviously emerged at the Danish
Post Giro office in Copenhagen and created a lot of panic. The report
was the usual sort of journalists' blather, basically implying that
Viruses are God's punishment for pirate copying. Still, one gets
nervous. I'll take a backup of all harddisks here at Roskilde
University just before the date (something one should do anyway ...),
I mean in our department, but what else can one do? Please advise (I'm
following the newsletter, of course) ...
