Subject: Re: CheckSum Methods of Virus Detection (PC)
 
  Peter Jaspers-Fayer (in Issue 93) mentioned that CHECKOUT does not
checksum the boot sector.  It's strange, but despite the abundance of
boot sector viruses, few checksum programs are any better in this
respect than CHECKOUT.  In fact, of the over 20 such programs I have
heard of for the PC, none of the freeware/shareware ones and not too
many of the commercial ones checksum the boot sector.
 
  And even of those who are aware of the need to checksum the boot
sector in addition to files, most seem to miss the fact that the
*partition record* also contains code which is executed when booting
from a hard disk.  And there's at least one virus (the "Stoned" or
"Marijuana" virus, which apparently originated in New Zealand) which
exploits this fact.  Note, by the way, that Len Levine's method (in
Issue 95) of copying the content of the boot block to a file won't
work in the case of the partition record since DEBUG can't access it.
 
  Concerning Len's solution for the boot block, he writes:
>Note that a virus that affects every read made from the disk,
>detects an attempt to read the boot block, and passes you a copy
>of the good boot block instead of the infected one, will defeat
>this.
 
  But that's only if the virus is already in memory.  You can avoid
this problem by running the checksum program immediately after cold
booting from a system which is known to be clean (as was mentioned
recently by David Chess).

Subject: re: Information wanted on "Stoned" virus (PC)
 
Tom Sheriff asked about this virus back on 4/17.  I've seen it, and
done a certain amount of analysis.  It seems to infect both floppies
and hard disks.  It captures INT13, and uses that to try to infect any
floppies read or written in drive A: (BIOS 00).  If an infected floppy
is used to boot a machine with a C: drive (BIOS 80), the c: drive will
become infected.  If an infected floppy is booted at just the right
time (it tests the system clock), the message (or at least the first
sentence) is displayed on the screen before the boot occurs.  The
message will not be displayed when booting from an infected hard disk.
 
The virus is rather lazy, and uses hard-wired locations to store the
original boot record.  So it will overlay possibly-in-use tracks when
it infects a new disk or diskette.  That's the only "destructive"
behavior that I saw.  It makes no attempt to hide, and an infected
boot record can be visually identified by the presence of the message.
Automatic programs that watch for changes to boot sectors should have
no trouble spotting it, either.
 
Usual disclaimers: the virus that I'm describing here may not be the
same one you're infected with!!  Get a guru to analyze yours
thoroughly before deciding that you're clean.  (If it *is* the same
one I've seen, it'll be pretty simple to analyze...)

Subject: Write protecting a hard disk (Mac)
 
Is it possible to lock a Macintosh hard disk so as to protect it from
an infection?

Subject: Virus papers (finally) available on Lehigh LISTSERV
 
After much prodding, I've placed most of the virus papers that we've
accumulated on the LISTSERV@LEHIIBM1.BITNET.  BITNET users can now
obtain these files from LISTSERV (please don't send your requests to
the list - it won't work).  Note that the series of reports on the
Internet worm are not included on the LISTSERV, primarily for reasons
of size (most of them exceed the BITNET limit of 300000 characters, as
stated in the BITNET Usage Guidelines).
 
These files, as with the ones on lll-winken.llnl.gov, are also
accessible via anonymous FTP to IBM1.CC.Lehigh.EDU.
 
Also, I was asked to include a description (or abstract) of each of
the documents.  Here is what I have (along with filenames in CAPS), in
no particular order:
 
 
"Coping with Computer Viruses and Related Problems"
                by Steve R. White, David M. Chess, and Chengi Jimmy Kuo
                   of IBM
                January 1989
                LISTSERV Filename: IBM PAPER
 
ABSTRACT: We discuss computer viruses and related problems.  Our
intent is to help both executive and technical managers understand the
problems that viruses pose, and to suggest practical steps they can
take to help protect their computing systems.
 
 
 
"Developing Virus Identification Products"
                by Tim Sankary
                Copyright (c) 1989, all rights reserved.
                (April) 1989
                LISTSERV Filename: IDENTIFY TXT
 
DESCRIPTION: This paper presents techniques for virus identification.
 
 
 
"Net Hormones"
                by David S. Stodolsky, PhD. of Copenhagen University
                Copyright (c) 1989, all rights reserved.
                March 1989
                LISTSERV Filename: HORMONES NET
 
ABSTRACT: A new type of infection control mechanism based upon contact
tracing is introduced. Detection of an infectious agent triggers an
alerting response that propagates through an affected network. A
result of the alert is containment of the infectious agent as all
hosts at risk respond automatically to restrict further transmission
of the agent.  Individually specified diagnostic and treatment methods
are then activated to identify and destroy the infective agent. The
title "Net Hormones" was chosen to indicate the systemic nature of
this programmed response to infection.
 
 
 
"Computer Viruses: A Rational View"
                by Raymond M. Glath of RG Software Systems, Inc.
                April 1988.
                LISTSERV Filename: VIRUS GLATH
 
DESCRIPTION: This paper presents an overview of viruses and associated
terminology.  It examines such topics as how one might become infected
by a virus, and what to do if one does become infected.  It also sets
guidelines for virus prevention and removal.
 
 
 
"The Infection of PC Compatible Computers"
                by Stephen E. Kiel and Raymond K. Lee of Georgia Tech
                Summer 1988.
                LISTSERV Filename: VIRUS KIEL
 
DESCRIPTION: The recent publicity over computer viruses has produced
mixed reactions and much confusion inside, as well as outside, of the
computing industry.  The conflicting opinions are caused either by a
misunderstanding of what viruses are or a lack of understanding of
their potential problems.  This paper answers those questions and in
addition, gives a description of currently suggested methods for IBM
PC's and compatibles for detecting, preventing, and eliminating
viruses.  A highly technical discussion is not the objective, but
rather a broad overview is given along with sources of additional
information and assistance.
 
 
 
"Potential Virus Attack"
                by L. P. Levine of University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee
                September 1988
                LISTSERV Filename: VIRUS LEVINE
 
DESCRIPTION: This paper examines the vulnerability to viruses of Dr.
Levine's computing environment and suggests methods for reducing its
risk.
 
 
 
"Virus 101" (Chapters 1-4)
                by George Woodside
                March 1989
                LISTSERV Filenames: V101 1   V101 2   V101 3   V101 4
 
DESCRIPTION: This series of papers present an in-depth look at
viruses, in the form of a virus "course" of four chapters.  Note that
many of the author's statements are specific to his ATARI ST.
