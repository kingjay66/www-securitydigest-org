VIRUS-L Digest   Wednesday, 13 Sep 1989    Volume 2 : Issue 191

VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: October 12/13-CORRECTION (PC)

I apologize for any confusion I may have caused, but it seems that the
Datacrime viruses (1168 and 1280) do in fact not activate on Oct. 12.

The correct activation date is Oct. 13.

So:    No viruses vill activate on Oct. 12, but quite a few will
       attack on Friday Oct. 13.

       Datacrime vill attack the first time an infected program is
       run, on (or after) Oct. 13.

(Thanks to D. Chess for the correction)

Subject: Iceland/Saratoga viruses (PC)

There seem to be three different viruses in this general family:

   - One is a resident EXE-file infector that infects every tenth
     EXE file executed, and sometimes will mark a free cluster on a
     hard disk as bad (the "damage" routine).  I've seen this one
     called the "Saratoga 1".
   - The second (not that the order I'm listing them in necessarily
     means anything) is just like the first, except that it checks
     the segment of the INT13 vector, and if it's not 0070 or F000,
     it doesn't do anything.   I've seen this called the "Saratoga 2",
     and also the "Icelandic Disk-Crunching virus" (that name is from
     Fridrik Skulason).
   - The third differs from the first in that it bypasses INT21 (by
     means that I suppose I shouldn't mention in public), and doesn't
     have the "mark a cluster bad" code.  It doesn't have the INT13
     check that the second version does.   Fridrik Skulason calls
     this, quite reasonably, the "Icelandic Virus, version 2".

Does this check correctly with everyone?   The Saratoga/Icelandic
nomenclature is a bit confusing, and I want to make sure that
there's general agreement about the facts, if not the names...   DC

Subject: Virus frequency (PC)

It was interesting to see the numbers by John McAfee, regarding the
frequency of various PC viruses in the US. Just to illustrate how
different things are elsewhere, here is an estimate of the situation
here in Iceland.

    1701/1704       60 %
    Ping-Pong       30 %
    Icelandic        5 %
    Brain            5 %

No other virus has so far been detected here in Iceland, which quite
surprising, since some viruses that are very common elsewhere,
Jerusalem and Stoned in particular, should have arrived here by now.

The major reason the 1701/1704 number is so high is that some large
companies have been infected. They include the University of Iceland,
the Post & Telephone company and two major computer companies here.

In one case there was a company-wide infection, and a good reason for
that.  It seems that somebody in management had decided that only a
handful of men should have permission to install new software. This
was done for a number of reasons, one of them to minimize the
likelihood of virus infections.

What happened was that one person in this group got infected, and
within two weeks he had spread the infection all over the company -
You see, they were upgrading from DOS 3.2 to 3.3, and he was
resposible for distributing the master copies to every department. On
every disk was a copy of the Icelandic keyboard program - a program
that was executed in AUTOEXEC.BAT. And - this program was infected
with 1704.

The past week the entire PC support department there has been working
overtime cleaning up their mess and running disinfection programs.

Subject: Suggestions on subject lines in comp.virus


As a reader of comp.virus and *many* other newsgroups there is one thing
that I really appreciate: Intelligent subject lines. Lots of time can be
saved if subject lines contain proper information so that uninterested
readers may do effective kills.

What has this got do to with comp.virus? I am (personally) interested only
in articles regarding Macintosh virus strains. Thus I have put in my kill
file PC, Amiga etc, so that I don't have to read them.

Now this is my idea: Everybody should compose subject lines that show which
computer system the article considers. Examples:

Subject: New mega-nasty virus strain (Mac)
Subject: Disk-destructive virus (Amiga)
...

Comments? Suggestions?

[Ed. A good point, and I've been promoting good subject lines on
VIRUS-L/comp.virus for some time now.  And, I do try to put a (PC),
(Mac), etc. at the end of subject lines where applicable, if the
author has not already.]

If everybody helped one newuser today, the world would look a bit happier.

I just received the book "Applied HyperTalk" which contains a disk with
HyperCard 1.2.2 on it.  This disk is infected with nVIR A!

The Book:
        Applied HyperTalk
        by Jerry Daniels and Mary Jane Mara
        Brady Utility, Prentice Hall Trade, Simon & Schuster
        ISBN: 0-13-040882-4
The Disk:
        Brady
        HyperCard 1.2.2 infected with nVIR A
        Also Several stacks and a text file which are not infected.

I will be contacting the publisher, the Small Computer Book Club (where
I got the book), and Apple about this.

If you have a copy of this, PLEASE check it for viruses!!!

     Everybody (the press ) is talking about the virus and as one
person stated "The Mania is started".  Well to add to the panic
I just heard about it over the RADIO in Grand Rapids Mi.  I
Didn't here all of it, but mainly it said watch out for it and
some "group of people" have a anti-virus for it and to give them
a call if you wanted a copy.
