Anyone who is wondering what Robert Morris, Jr. looks like should have
a look at Page 66 in Discover Magazine (January 1989 issue)...

Although the AIDS situation has contributed to the adoption of the
term "virus" for intrusively self-replicating codes, even before the
AIDS awareness, virus would probably have been adopted for this type
of program code.

First, the term virus existed well before the early 1980's when the
AIDS situation was first publicized. The general public had some
awareness of the nature of biological viruses from variety of other
cases- cancer, rhinovirus, etc.

Second, the parallel between the biological DNA/RNA coding and the
binary coding when comparing biological viruses with computer viruses
would be a logical connection. These parallels are not the result of
merely back-reading biological allusions into a type of computer code.

As for the application of the term "virus" to intrusivly self-replica-
ting code futher back than 5 or 6 years, I know of no specific case.
Yet the terms worm and tapeworm had been applied to non-intrusively
replicating programs. (INterestingly enough, there was no epidemic of
parasitic diseases in the USA or globally in those years. So, the
origin of a usage does not always have to be based upon the current
fear or fad.) The reason that the term virus did not arise back then
was that any examples -real or conceptual- of such code was
practically unknown back then. The worm-type of programs were better
known.

This does bring up another aspect in the development of terms and
their usage- the perception of new categories emerging. The concept of
code we call viruses today was within the grasp of computer knowledge
and reasonable extrapolation for several decades. There was no giant
leap of technology in the past 5 years that was neccessary for
viruses.  Rather it was a matter of discerning that this categorycould
exist and then to conceptualize it.

Not sure how long viruses have been around but I fondly remember my
first encounter with the concept in a book by David Gerrold called
"When Harlie Was One," published in 1972 by Ballantine.  Gerrold wrote
of a virus that auto dialed numbers, found other computers,
transmitted itself and kindly erased itself at the previous site.
Unfortunately, because of a bad connection, the program lost the code
for self erasing, and the "infection" spread widely and quickly.
Beyond these descriptions (starting on page 175) the book is an
interesting science fiction about artificial intelligence and machine
conciousnous.  Whether the virus program was fact or fiction at that
time, I don't know.
