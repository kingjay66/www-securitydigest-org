Subject:      Disk Protection (MAC)

   There is much talk about disk protection for the IBM systems.  Does
anyone have any Information relating to the MAC system?  I know that
there is a DiskLock DA that simulates the locking of a disk via
software.  This includes the ability to lock a hard drive through
software.  Does this mean that the MAC is just as susceptible to
viruses over-riding the write protection tab or is software just
written to add the additional possibility of protecting hard drives?
                                   Scott.

Subject: Re: Mr. Harlan's question about anti-viral software

The question of what anti-viral software is available is a common
question these days. The answer is too involved for real-time typing
here. However, I can suggest a book from COMPUTE! Publications
titled COMPUTER VIRUSES. The is, if I remember correctly, Ralph Roberts.
(The book also includes a few chapters writen by other people.) In this
book are annotated listings of anti-viral software for MS-DOS and
other types of computers.

Also, COMPUTERS & SECURITY magazine reviews such software. There are
several magazines which have articles about protective software.
<Hopefully, I have not transgressed the non-commercial aspects of
BITNET with the above.>

Before you buy protective software, consider several things so you
have a good idea of you need and you can work with.

*)How much do you want to limit your PC's functionality? Some
  anti-virus software provides good measure of protection by
  limiting what can be done on the machine. For example, the ability
  change selected files is restricted by means as simple as changing
  the file's attribute to using routines that will stop the system
  if any changes are attempted. Often such software, besides acting
  to stop most viruses, prevents users from running "non-authorized"/
  non-work-related programs on a company machine. Some people love
  this feauture, others loath it.

*) Who will be using the machine? What is the user's level of computer
expertise? This is important because some protective software,
  especially the TSR "watchdog" programs, can display prompts and
  warnings that can confuse and frighten the novice user.<The TSR
  programs run in the background, watch for "suspicious" activity,
  and warn the user of such activities.> Others are much more user-
  friendly.  Consider the user interfaces - the messages, prompts,
  etc.

*) The ideaprogram for most people is one that doesn't remind the
  the user that it is there, but comes to aid when needed. The more
a program reminds that user that it there by getting in the way of
  normal work, the more the user is going to resent the protection
  and may try to bypass it.

*) Assess your risks. Mr. Harlan brought up the question does being
  on BITNET increase the risk of viruses. Generally, no. The risk
  for "rabbit letters" and such, yes. The risk for viruses goes up
  when one is getting programs files, executable code from outside
  sources. Text files, unless they can be remotely compiled and run,
  do not carry viruses. One big element for risk assementis what are
  you protecting and how hard is it to recover it if disaster does
  occur. Another factor is degree of contact with outside systems
  via telecommunications, disks brought in, etc. The more connections
  with other systems, the greater the risk.

Subject: Leisure Suit Larry Trojan Horse

Several weeks ago, there were a couple of postings about a trojan
horse infecting out-of-the-shrinkwrap copies of a game called Leisure
Suit Larry (in the Land of the Lounge Lizzards).  I bought that and
had not yet tried it.  I still have not yet tried it.  I would like
some sort of definite information before I try it.  Would the people
who posted the original messages either respond to the list with a bit
more detail, or directly to me (HAMER@VCUVAX.BITNET or
HAMER@GEMS.VCU.EDU on the Internet) if you don't want to post much
detail to the list.  Thanks.
