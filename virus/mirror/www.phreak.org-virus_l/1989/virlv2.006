Subject: Any Friday the 13th Virii?

I recently saw some info on UseNet about a virus that activates on
Friday the 13th.  Since we'll have one of these next week, could you
all please send in whatever info on detection/removal of all virii
that activate on this date?

thanks.
Mark

Subject: Some thoughts on VIRUS-L & comments on hard disk format (PC)

     Some notes on the VIRUS-L mailing list and submissions there to,
but first an introduction, I am Stephen D. Cohen I am a systems engineer
with a small R and D firm in northern New Jersey.  I have a degree in
Computer Engineering (EE core until Senior year, with extra emphasis on
software) from Lehigh university.  I have been interested in viruses,
worms, and computer security in general for about 5 years now.

     I have been a subscriber to this list off and on since spring of 88.
The reason that I have to cancel subscription from time to time is a
simple matter of cost to me, and proper etiquette from my fellow network
users.  I AM IN NO WAY ASKING FOR CONTRIBUTIONS OR IN ANY WAY PLEADING!!
I am merely alerting you all to the existence of users who are not
institutional, do not have multi-million dollar corporations providing
them with network connectionires a long distance phone call.

     What I am about to say can be considered flaming or raving if one
wishes to take it that way.  I need to get this off my chest.

     I requested from Ken Van Wyk that a partially decomposed digeshave, that ie
deadwood striped out ofthat
the effort required on his part would be to great.  I and
contributors, take the initiative to eliminate the dead

      1.  On Monday 12 Dec 88, Victor ET Christensen posed a 250 line
      message containing the full text of a couple of articles from a
      well known journal for which citations were given!  Could he not
      have left it at  and Dan Hankins accounted for at least 250
      lines of text in the last 10 digests.  Shouldn't we be having this
      discussion (argument?) in a private forum, i.e., individual
      E mail?

      3.  Some of the Trailers are getting out of hand.  I am not
      talking about the people with one or two line cute expressions at
      the end of rifice personal
      demographic information for the sake of humor.  I am talking about
      the 10 line monstrositis with pictures of New York state on them
      showing us iles) in case
      we cared, didn't own an atlas, don't know any one who owns an
      atlas, or don't know how to use a library to gain access to one.
      I single out this t this forum would be more
effective for all if the information content could just be raised a
few points, and some of the white space (brown space?) eliminated.

     Enough of my ravings.  I feel much better now.

     A few notes on issues that I have been reading about.

Low level formats of fixed disks:

     I have seen several questions appear about low level formatting a
hard drive.  It is important to note that this will only solve some
viral problems, and may not solve anything if not approached correctly.
After performing a low level format (actually a diskwipe from the Norton
Utilities from a ``clean'' system would do just as well) it is important
that all software be reloaded from trusted original disks.  DO NOT JUST
RELOAD A BACKUP!  Reloading a backup may remove some of the DOS boot
block viruses  do nothing for viruses
infecting other programs.  Remember, 40% or more executable files for an
IBM-PC with the ``.COM'' extension begin with a long jump (read, are
easily infected by viruses).  I can not stress enough the importance oflly the l
distribution me intact.


viruses in general:

     In his letter of Monday 12 Dec 88, Michael J. MacDonald referred to
a program that sounded clearly to be a virus as a worm.  I think that
there is quite a bit of confusion going around about these terms.

     I am not an ultimate authority on this subject, but I believe that
the following definitions are correct.

     VIRUS:  A piece of code that attaches to another rogram and replicates its,
             on to other pieces of code, or programs.

     Note that this definition does not require that the piece of code
be damaging in the classical ways, i.e., hard drive reformat.  It
requires only the two criteria of reproduction, and host requirement.

     WORM:   A piece of code that replicates itself elsewhere, not
             requiring any type of host code, i.e., a stand alone
             program.

     Note that some times a ``gang of programs'' wi``grapling hook'' program and
then transferred itself using the hook.

     Enough ravings for one night.  Thank you ave not offended too many people.f
they are not of a construcRUS-L.

Subject: HARdware SECurity-L summary:  Nobody wants it

A couple of digests ago, I asked what you thought about a HARdware
SECurity list (considering the recent disk drive conversation).

I got four responses & saw one on a digest.  The vote is 5-0 against a
new list.  Reasons cited: people didn't want to sub to yet another
list, the issues are relevant to viruses, and there is already a
security list.  Enough said, send comment to me at:

It is worth noting that the federal government is in fact rather
deeply involved in the development of software standards; sometimes
originating them, more often adopting standards of the American
National Standards Institute or other responsible bodies.  Government
professionals participate on many of the committees which develop
these standards.
tandards developed with at least some government
involvement includes the American Standard Code for Information
Interchange, COBOL, FORTRAN, BASIC, PASCAL, and ADA.  The government
is also deeply involved in operating system standardization and
communication protocols.

What is significant is that the government does not force anybody to
meet any staly buy products which meet
applicable standards--and this preference has had some influence on
the marketplace.

It would be both unrealistic and undesirable to expect the govee every copy of .
There are existing laws and concepts of liability which cover these
situae seriously harmed by
carelessly marketed or prepared software products could fail to
recover (handsomely) in court.

Subject: Anti-virals-for-micros inquiry (PC)

     As I am one of two regular users of an IBM PC XT (with an
Inboard/386 motherboard and a 30Mb hard disk).  My employer andpossibility (rems
infecting our set-up.  We try to practice "safe computing" -- we
aren't pe, etc. -- but nonetheless
we're wondering if some sort of protection might be prudent.

     What sort of anti-viral software could/would any of you recommend
for a micro environment such as ours?  (We operate under IBM DOS 3.20,
incire necessary?  Does fairly frequent
connection to BITNET have any bearing on risk?  (If so, is there any
effective way of combatting that risk?)

     I apologize if my questionaivete, but I
figure Virus-L is the best place to seek enlightenment!  Thanks in
advance for any help.
