A few comments:
   - since the boot part of the ghost virus does not spread,
     it can not properly be called a virus, so I do not think it should be
     included.

   - The Pentagon virus does not work. Why include it ?

   - Why not include Agiplan, Oropax, Missouri, Macho and Nichols ?

   - Do-nothing Remains resident

   - 1168/1280 do not use self-encryption.

Apart from this it's a good list.

I am trying to compile a list showing where the various viruses seem
to have originated. Here is what I have got so far, but I am sure the
list contains several errors, and I would be very grateful for any
comments and corrections.

Would someone elaborate on this?  Surely a program (virus or otherwise)
running under the emulator could do the same things, including deleting all
the files it can find, as on DOS.  What protection is provided?  Perhaps
not allowing access to the FAT, boot sector, etc.?

At least in the case of VP/ix (which I used on a Zenith 386 SCO Xenix
system when I worked at Lehigh), all DOS calls are subject to
"approval" by Xenix - or UNIX for that matter, on a 386 UNIX system.
All interrupts, etc., are handled by Xenix in the end.  The DOS
session(s) runs as a virtual 8086 on the 386, and is given an image
file which appears to be a physical hard disk to the DOS session.  The
"boot sector" per se is just part of a file on the Xenix file system
(or on a floppy if the VP/ix system is rebooted from floppy).  I would
imagine that this logical physical (?!) drive would be subject to boot
sector infections, but the actual Xenix disk is treated as a network
disk.  If a VP/ix process tries to delete or alter any of the Xenix
files, it would be subject to standard Xenix file protection
mechanisms.  I never did try to perform any direct (via hardware) read
or writes on the hard disk, but I suspect that they would be stopped.
Can anyone confirm this?

One interesting side-effect of the way VP/ix works is that a
(ctrl-alt-del) reboot really works - and can, in fact, be used to
reboot from floppy.  The VP/ix session boot DOS, while leaving the
Xenix system quite in-tact.  Very disconcerting the first time it's
done.

Running a DOS emulator under UNIX (or Xenix), in my opinion, would be
a very expensive anti-virus tool.  To me, there are plenty of other
good reasons to run UNIX on a 386 or 486.

Subject: CVIA clarifications

Original-Date: 11-20-89 18:10:56
Original-From: John McAfee

        I regret that Ross Greenberg and three of my other competitors
mentioned in his statement persist in an attitude of hostility toward
myself and my endeavors.  I have no answer to Ross's allegations that
could possibly suffice, other than that my own recollections of the
events he described differ radically from his descriptions.  I must
set the record straight on two points however: First, Ross states that
the CVIA sells anti-viral software and that SCAN is one of its
products.  The CVIA does not sell any product, SCAN or otherwise, and
has never sold any product.  It is a non-profit corporation funded
solely by the membership and its only other source of income is
through the distribution of a public information packet (price -
$4.00; cost to produce - $4.70).
  Second, Ross states that the CVIA is an organization of antiviral
product vendors.  This is entirely incorrect.  The majority of members
are computer manufacturers or software houses with no existing or
planned antivirus products as part of their product lines.  It is true
that the beginning membership was composed of antiviral product
vendors, but the understanding from the beginning was that the
organization must have (and indeed now has) a broad industry
participation.

Subject: followup on mind viruses

Dear virus-folk:
thanks for all the responses to Richard Dawkins questions. Here's some
further thoughts from Richard on the topic of mind viruses...He and I
would be interested in your opinions, especially on evolving/mutating
virus technology. Has anyone seen viri which evolve, or mutate in
response to the environment which it is in? Or viri which recognize
and "use" other viri which might be present?

OK Richard, you may begin...
- ----------------------------
There is something important about the distinction between what I call
Anarchic Replicators and Socialized Replicators.  In the world of DNA,
anarchic replicators are things like viruses, or smaller units with
names like viroids or plasmids, which parasitically exploit the
large-scale transcribing and copying machinery in cells, machinery
which has been put together by cooperating teams of socialized
replicators.  Socialized replicators are the ordinary mainline genes
that travel from generation to generation in sperms or eggs and
cooperate to build big survival-machines like our bodies.  In a sense,
our 'own' genes are parasitic on each aother's efforts, just as virus
genes are parasitic on the efforts of other genes.

In the world of mind viruses, the reason large religions like Islam or
Roman Catholicism fascinate (as well as repel) me is that they are
large aggregations of mutually socialized viruses, which work to
sustain other members of the cluster and work to destroy alternative
replicators.  e.g. Islam has a rule that apostates must be punished by
death.  The rule of priestly celibacy in Catholicism at first sight
doesn't seem like a self-preserving replicator. But it frees the
priest's time for more active proselytizing, and it enjoys a good
mutualistic relationship with another rule of contraception among
non-priests.

In the world of computer viruses, I find it harder to find an analogy
for socialized replicators.  I gather that anti-virus programmers have
already used the 'biological control' self-replication technique -
sending in a tame,'good' virus to catch the bad one.  This reminds us
of the possibility of a kind of ecology of computer viruses building.
We are reminded of this, again, in another of the papers which states
that viruses that were originally intended to be benign can turn
unintentionally malignant when the user upgrades to a new Operating
System.  A given OS serves as an environment in which a virus may
flourish or not, may behave benignly or malignantly.  Couldn't we
envisage a time when the whole computer environment facing a new virus
is put together, not just by one monolithic OS, but by the OS plus a
motley collection of aleady-infiltrated viruses, some benign, some
malignant, s ome medicinal.  New viruses will be written to flourish,
not just in known OSs, like System 6, System 7 and so on, but in a
background containing an unknown but statistically guessable
collection of already existing viruses.  Already, the environment that
even a legitimate programmer has to cope with is more than just the
operating system - think of the motley collection of co-resident INITs
and Desk Accessories that you have to worry about when writing a
program for public consumption.  A virus ecology will just complicate
the picture, in the same 'biological' direction.  The language I am
now using is not too far from the language that I use (e.g. in The
Selfish Gene and The Extended Phenotype) to describe the co-evolution
of genes in genomes.

So far, as far as I know computer viruses don't evolve.  Even with
viruses manufactured by conscious human programmers, something like a
mutually co-evolved cluster of viruses could come to constitute the
environment to which any future virus has to accommodate itself.  If
truly evolving (self-modifying in adaptive directions) viruses start
to arise, the trend will go even further.  Software Companies may have
to write their products to be compatible, not just with numbered
versions of 'The System', but with the changing statistical ensemble
of fellow-travellers both good and bad.

I'd be interested in hearing whether any of this makes sense.
Richard

Thanks to Alan for his contribution on Fri. Nov. 17th.  Listing many
or all of the Virus Disinfectors and the viruses associated with
them was a big help and a time saver.  Hunting through the back

Subject: Potential Virus? (Mac)

I have just recently noticed a problem on my Mac. After using Cricket
Graph I checked the last modified date and the program had just been
modified.  After noting this, I began checking other programs and
found that my copy of Versaterm Pro was also being modified every time
I ran it. It was at that point that I checked these programs on other
people's Macs in the office and saw that these programs were not being
modified on some, while they were being modified on others.. I am
running Gatekeeper and Vaccine and have checked these programs with
Disinfectant and they report no trouble.

My question is: Should these programs modify themselves when I just
run them.  All I do is run them and quit immediately and they are
modified??? Do you think I have a virus problem???

== Since last edition, ANTHRAX V. has been added. We have problems to ==
== get viruses, as many users wish to exchange their viruses (like    ==
== stamps) against our's, which we generally refuse: the Virus Test   ==
== Center's ethical standard says, that we do not spread viruses!     ==
== Please send infected programs without preconditions.               ==
