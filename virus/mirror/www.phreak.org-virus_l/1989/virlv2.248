VIRUS-L Digest   Monday, 27 Nov 1989    Volume 2 : Issue 248

VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,

Subject: "Where Did They Come From"

Thanks to Fridrik Skulason for his contribution.

It sustains my intuitive observation that Israel's merely two million
people are disproportionately represented as sources.  Perhaps they have
too much time on their hands.  Perhaps someone there fails to realize
his own interest in an orderly sandbox.

While we have been totally ineffective, not to say inept, in identifying
virus authors, there would seem to be an advantage to starting in a
small population with a lot of clues.

Subject: Potential impact of internet worm

Gene Spafford notes that the Morris worm (I still prefer to call it a
virus; afterall, it DID use the machinery of what it was infecting to
propagate itself) only infected 5% of the machines on a
known-to-be-insecure net.  It was stopped because it was noticed.  It
was noticed because of bugs that made it replicate much faster than
was intended.  Has anyone estimated how far it would have gotten had
those bugs not been there, i.e., if it had replicated so slowly as not
to be noticed?

I am an MBA student at the Wharton School, U. of Pennsylvania
researching the anti-virus software industry for a course in
entrepreneurial management.  I would greatly appreciate a list of
*comercial* anti-viral packages with a basic description of what they
do (detection, removal, etc.) and the addresses and/or telephone #s of
their publishers.  Since the field keeps changing so quickly (that's
why I'm studying it) it's very difficult for those of us not involved
directly with the industry to keep abreast.

Please send any info, comments or observations on the industry to:

Subject: Re: high-level language viruses

In Virus-L V2 #247, Fridrick Skulason (frisk@rhi.hi.is) asks
about viruses written in higher-level languages.

An oft ignored fact of HLL viruses is that some do have the ability to
spread between machines running the same HLL.  For example,
Smalltalk-80 operates on Macs, PS/2s, and 286 based PCs.  Now suppose
I write a virus that is written in Smalltalk-80.  It will not infect,
say, the System file on a Mac, or the .COM files on PCs, but it could
spread from Smalltalk-80 Mac to Smalltalk-80 286.

A precursor to this was the Dukakis Virus of last year.  The Dukakis
virus was written in Hyperscript, the programming language behind
Apple written in Hyperscript, the programming language behind Apple's
Hypercard product.  We are seeing Hypercard compatible products for
MS-DOS (Spinnaker's Plus product for the Mac and PC -- See MacWeek
21-Nov).  Consequently, Dukakis type viruses could pose threats to
both Macs and PCs, although only to a subgroup of those platforms
(those running the infectable application).

Subject: fPRT is **not** a virus (Mac)

Reports are flying around a variety of networks concerning an alleged
virus that leaves a "fPRT 0" resource in the Finder and other files.

fPRT 0 is created by the finder (and some other programs) when the
user changes the default print settings with "Page Setup..."  It is
not evidence of a virus.  The resource is about 120 bytes long and
does not contain code.  In any case, absent some other mechanism, it
could never be executed anyway.

While there may be some new virus out there (odds favor there not being
one, if my experience is any guide), fPRT 0 has nothing to do with it.

Subject: Stoned Virus Killer (PC)

I have seen a couple of postings asking about programs for zapping the
'Stoned' virus. There is one called KILLER written by someone at
Victoria University in NZ that removes the virus and restores the old
boot sector (I believe). I checked on the SIMTEL20 archives and it
doesn't seem to be there so don't know if it is easily obtainable
outside of NZ. I can post it to this group or get it put somewhere
accessible if this is the case.

The recent attacks by the WANK worm on the "World DECnet" was an example
of a program that "evolved" and "mutated" as it propagated through the
network.

It "evolved" such that it added to itself when it learned a new common
username to attack.  Each new common username added an additional line
to the code, thus making the worm a little bit "smarter".

It "mutated" such that the program would delete certain routines if the
program determined that certain conditions applied.  These conditions
were related to it's discovery on the network.

Admittably, these are simple examples.  But they may be an indication of
things to come.

From:    John Goodman <stanton!john@uunet.UU.NET>
Subject: Non-executable viruses

I am puzzled by something.

Last summer I recall seeing an article about a virus that infected
spreadsheets.  That's right, spreadsheets, not spreadsheet programs.
(Sorry, I don't recall either the author's name or the name of the
article.  I was given a copy, so I am unsure where or even if it was
printed for wide distribution.)

The described virus's method of action was an auto-executing macro
that was hidden somewhere in a large spreadsheet where it was unlikely
to be noticed, yet whenever the spreadsheet was loaded it would "do
its thing."  Since, this author asserted, modern spreadsheet programs
often have very powerful macro languages including access to DOS
functions and running DOS programs and an auto-execute feature, it is
possible to write a comparably powerful virus in this fashion.

Naturally, such a virus would not be found by looking only at .EXE and
.COM files (plus the boot sector).  It could only be found by looking
inside the worksheets and knowing something of the nature of their
storage of that kind of macro (a knowledge that would vary by the
brand and release of the various spreadsheet program on the market).

What puzzles me is that this author said he had withheld saying
anything about his ideas along this line until he had actually seen a
live sample of such a virus.  Then he did experiments in his lab to
confirm his notion of what was going on, then wrote it all up in the
paper I saw.

I have seen nothing here about this problem, nor do the VIRUSCAN
programs look for any such viruses.

Has anyone here seen such a virus?

Are there any programs that do check for such?

Is there anyone concerned about this (potential or actual ??) problem?

I also note that a similar virus problem could manifest with bogus
code being included in any source file that would be "run" through an
interpreter on any computer system (which includes a lot of games in
interpreted BASIC, often distributed in a fashion that makes it at
least very difficult to list their contents), so we are not really
only talking here about spreadsheets and PCs.

I am not sounding an alert, as I have not seen any such virus myself.
I am instead voicing a concern and asking for references to any
programs that might help one protect one's computer(s) (PC systems in
particular) against that sort of threat.

DOS runs as a UNIX task subject to the UNIX protection mechanisms. In
particular, it does not have direct access to the hardware unless
deliberately configured that way, and it does not have permission
to write any files that a normal UNIX task could not write. There is
also no backdoor to the file system via any BIOS.

So it's not subject to infection by standard DOS virus techniques, and
even if the DOS emulator becomes infected the damage would be limited
to the DOS-accesible files in a single user's account.

It's also not possible to directly read or write the configuration files
from DOS, because they're owned by the superuser and protected from
writing.

Now it should be possible to write a virus that would deliberately infect
DOS under UNIX systems (by setting up a trojan horse, for example), but
this would be a second-level effect... and the number of such systems
is much smaller than pure-DOS systems (a 386 box costs something like
5 times an XT) that it's not a very tempting target.

Samples of a second version of EAGLE.EXE have been received from both

From:    IA88000 <IA88@PACE.BITNET>
Subject: EAGLE.EXE 2nd Version Discovered (PC)

 I should have know better than to think my last report was the final
report on this subject. Over the past several days a NEW version of
EAGLE.EXE was discovered in Washington and Wichita.

 This new version contains the same "trojan", ie; if COMMAND.COM is
found in the ROOT directory, AND if the system has a '286, '386, or
'486 CPU, EAGLE.EXE will proceed to overwrite the Boot sector and
both FAT's as well as several other sectors with an ASCII 246.

 The major difference is that the new version of EAGLE.EXE has a
new strain of the AIDS virus, which is alive, well and infectious.

 EAGLE.EXE was again compressed, which stops "SCAN.EXE" from
recognizing the virus contained in the file.

 Here is all we know about the two versions of EAGLE.EXE:

 EAGLE.EXE - Version 1 contains the Jerusalem B virus and a very
nasty trojan which will check for COMMAND.COM in the root and if
it is found and if the CPU is a '286 or higher, EAGLE.EXE Ver. 1
will overwrite the Boot sector and both FAT's with ASCII 246.

EAGLE.EXE - Version 2 - Same as above except it contains a new
strain of the AIDS virus.

 Both programs were written in Quick Basic and compiled using BASCOM.

 Both programs are compiled and compressed in such a way as to prevent
a normal scanning utility from detecting the viruses in these files.

 A floppy disk can be protected from the trojan by a write protect tab.

 Both of the viruses are currently active. The trojan part of each
IS NOT part of the virus.

Now for the good news:

EAGLSCAN which was made available by the people at SWE has been
modified to detect both versions of EAGLE.EXE and is currently
being made available to VIRUS-L readers, FREE of CHARGE, by simply
sending a formatted 5.25 inch 360k disk with a return address label
and RETURN POSTAGE (stamps ok) to the following address:

                             SWE
                             132 Heathcote Road
                             Elmont, New York 11003

You will receive the latest version of EAGLSCAN, which can detect and
warn you if either version of EAGLE.EXE is present. There is no charge
for the program, but PLEASE....include postage (stamps ok)! The people
at SWE have gone out of their way to help in this matter and it is
only fair to include postage. Of the three hundred requests received so
far, twenty three of them did not include return postage. SWE has
decided to return these disks, via Parcel Post, so those who did not
send postage will receive the program, as soon as the US Mail service
gets around to delivering their Parcel Post shipments.

In answer to some of the people who have sent mail, neither version of
EAGLE.EXE will be available or uploaded to Homebase. The announcement
that it would be made available to McAfee Associates was premature to
say the least. I am not privy to why this decision was made.

It would appear your ONLY source for a program which can detect either
version of EAGLE.EXE is the above address. The latest version of SCAN
from McAfee was tested again on both versions of EAGLE.EXE and was not
able to detect a virus in either file.

To those who already sent disks to SWE, I have been informed that every
disk sent, (except for the ones without postage) is now on its way back
to you, via US mail. SWE finished up the disks early this AM and all
were deposited with the US mail service.

If you desire to receive a free copy of EAGLSCAN, please be sure your
formatted disk, return disk mailer and return postage (stamps ok)
arrive at SWE, NO LATER than December 15th. SWE will be closing for the
holidays December 18th, and will process all disks received as of 12/15.

Thanks must be passed along to the two people in Washington and Kansas
who sent the new versions of EAGLE.EXE for examination.

That is about it for now.

Subject: The DIR EXEC consequences... (VM/CMS)

It seems to me that the latest DIR EXEC has become far more publicized than
The author could have possibly hoped for.
Due to the multiple-list posting, the warning message got bounced around
sixteen times or so from Mail_system@VAX.OXFORD.AC.UK ...
Thus jamming Bitnet far more effectively than the DIR EXEC ever could.
Perhaps this was the desired effect the author wanted?
