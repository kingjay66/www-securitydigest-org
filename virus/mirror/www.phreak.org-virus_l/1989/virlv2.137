We have discovered a PC virus on campus.  It is readily apparent in
WordPerfect 4.2 applications which refuse to run from the C: drive and
display the error:

Can't find correct copy of WP.EXE
Enter full path and filename (Example: C:\WP\WP.EXE)

It appears as though at least one other university campus has a similar
problem (see messages below).  This virus infects .EXE and .COM files
when you run them; it does not appear to infect the IBM*.COM and
COMMAND.COM files stored on disk.  We are conducting further
investigations and hope to have more information in the near future.

Hi-
  Recently we began noticing a problem on some of our software,
specifically WordPerfect.  On all of our WordPerfect disks we get the
error can not find correct copy of WP.EXE.  If an infected disk is
used on a machine without rebooting it infects all disks used
subsequently.  The disks are infected immediatly, there is no latency
period.  Another symptom we have noticed is the monitor will display
snow and start scrolling/clearing the screen at random intervals.
When infected disks are reformatted they have numerous bad sectors.
We are worried that the virus might be infecting all of our disks.  It
might be surfacing on the Wordperfect disk, because they must be used
without a write protect tab.  Or possibly the sectors which the virus
first infects are necessary to WordPerfect performing correctly.  Has
anyone else encountered this problem?  Does anyone have any ideas on
how we should proceed?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Just thought you all might like to know the following:

There is a new virus floating around, which attacks WP.EXE in
particular and almost every other .EXE file it comes in contact
with. It is self propogating and trashes files and disks.

Some of the things to look for are as follows:

1) Strange blue/green blocks appear on the screen.
2) Running a .EXE you know is on the disk and getting a
   "File not found" error even though the .EXE is on the disk.
3) After 30 to 45 minutes everything seems to slow down. Doing
   a DIR takes 30 or 40 seconds for each line to appear.
4) It definitely spreads between .EXE files, although it appears
   .COM files are immune. [Nope, .COM files aren't immune.  - Lance]
5) It will spread to all types (sizes) of floppy disk drives
   and will jump to a hard drive.
More later...

If anyone has further information on (or experiences with) this virus,
please post it here, on comp.virus, or directly to us here at Stanford
(goodrich@jessica.stanford.edu or gx.tsg@stanford.bitnet) and we'll
compile the results and post them.

Hi all,

This week is my last week here at Lehigh.  Next week, I'll be starting
to organize things for my new job out at CMU (which I formally start
the following week - June 26).  As such, VIRUS-L/comp.virus will be
intermittent next week (read: whenever I can get to a machine, I'll
send out a digest).  Please keep the messages coming, and I'll try to
handle them as quickly as possible.

The change has made me curious about the future of VIRUS-L/comp.virus.
I will, as promised, continue to moderate, but where is the group
heading?  At the SEI, my project is very Internet related.  I'd like
to see some of the discussions here on VIRUS-L touch on network
security issues.  I'd also like to see more discussions on
non-microcomputers.  (This doesn't mean that we're abandoning micros
by any means, merely that I'd like to see the group branch into other
areas as well.)  Feel free to send comments/suggestions/gripes to me
and I'll summarize to the group or send in the individual comments.

Finally, thanks to all who sent in their support on my move!

Ken

P.S. My new e-mail address at CMU is: krvw@sei.cmu.edu.  The account
is open, so e-mail can be sent there any time.
