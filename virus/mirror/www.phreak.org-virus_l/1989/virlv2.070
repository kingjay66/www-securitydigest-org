At least one research center and three departments in the engineering
school here at the Univ. of Colorado have had their Macs infected
multiple times by nVIR.  At some sites, the people in charge don't
want to install _Vaccine because they do software development work.
There are alternatives, however.

The best general anti-viral utility I know of is an INIT/cdev called
GateKeeper.  Chris Johnson, its author, bills it as the "configure and
forget" approach to software protection.  It can block the
creation/modification of executable code and executable files by all
applications/INITs/etc. except those given special permission.
(Latest version is 1.1 - as of 3/20/89)

On the more specific anti-nVIR front, the RWatcher INIT is fantastic.
If it detects an application trying to add nVIR resources to another
file, it beeps 10 times and exits to the Finder.

Both of those ounces of prevention are in use at the center I work
for.  (Both are also free.)  It may just be coincidence, but we've
never had a machine infected.

There has been some user "resistance".  One of our more hot-headed
co-workers here was ranting yesterday about how GateKeeper was getting
in the way, throwing up stupid dialogs, and not letting him do his
work.  He'd ended up throwing it away and re-booting.  Turns out he
was just unwilling to take 15 seconds and give Tops and FORTRAN the
code modification and creation privileges they needed to work
correctly.  When I explained to him that once GateKeeper was
configured you didn't even need to think about it, he calmed down
somewhat.  But even with that illustration of how users will remove
anti-viral protection, we were still protected partially by RWatcher.

The main lesson I draw from this is that if a protection scheme is
*perceived* as getting in the way, some folks will remove it.
However, if it's unobtrusive, most users won't even know it's there
until they try an infected application.  We use a simple sign
directing users to see an advisor about their infected program if
their machine beeps 10 times or if GateKeeper vetoes a modification.
That way they're more likely to see someone who can help them rather
than removing the protection themselves.

Subject:  Report Query...

Was  a report  generated  on  the  "IBM Christmas  Card"  trojan horse
program that got loose in BITNET some time back ?  If  so, can someone
direct me to the server (or human being) that has it.

Thanks,

Subject: anti-virus recommendations from Computer World

Several months ago, I asked if anyone had heard about a set of
recommendations for combating viruses that had appeared in Computer
World.  I had hoped that the article would provide me with a better
lead on the entire guidelines.  I've still not had any luck with the
later, but I did manage to find a shortened list (there were supposed
to have been twenty items in all) in the September 19 issue of
Computer World.  Here they are:

*   All software should be purchased from known, reputable sources.

*   All purchased software should be in its original shrink-wrap or
    sealed-disk containers when received.

*   Backup copies of all original software should be made as soon as the
    package is opened and stored off-site.

*   Before installation, all software should be reviews carefully by a
    systems manager.

*   New software should be quarantined on an isolated computer to
    greatly reduce contamination risk.

*   A backup copy of all system software and data should be made a least
    once a month and stored for at least one year before reuse.  This
    will allow restoration of a system that has been contaminated by a
    time-release virus.  A plan that includes "grandfathered" rotation
    of backup copies will reduce risk even further.

*   System administrators should restrict access to programs and data on
    a need-to-use basis.  This isolates problems, protects critical
    applications and facilitates problem diagnostics.

*   All programs on a system should be checked regularly for size
    changes.  Any size deviations could be evidence of tampering or
    virus infiltration.

*   Many shareware and freeware programs provide a prime entry point for
    viruses.  Skeptical review and extended quarantine of such programs
    are prudent.

*   Plans should be made to quickly remove any software that exhibits
    symptoms of contamination and to immediately back up all related
    data.  Users should be informed of these plans, which should be
    tested and reviews periodically.

These recommendation were made by a small working group of network
manufacturers.  I've seen some flames (justified, I believe) about the
second-to-the-last point dealing with shareware and freeware.
Shareware developers saw this as an industry ploy to discredit
non-commercial software developers.  Naturally, I'm still looking for
the entire set of guidelines, so I'd appreciate hearing from anyone
who can help me find them.
