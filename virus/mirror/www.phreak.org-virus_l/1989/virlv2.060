[Ed. There's been quite a rash of messages sent to the list lately
that were intended for the LISTSERV (e.g., INDEX, LIST VIRUS-L, GET
VIRUS-L LOG8811A).  This is a reminder to everyone that LISTSERV
commands have to be sent to the LISTSERV, not to the list itself.  The
address of the LISTSERV is LISTSERV@LEHIIBM1.BITNET or
LISTSERV@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (either will work).]

Well, I've seen a boot-sector virus that did that.  It didn't seem to
be related to any other virus I've seen (code very different from the
Brain and so on).  It would infect both hard and floppy disks, and the
only obvious effect was the little bouncing face.  No EXE or COM file
involvement found or suspected.  Of course, what you have may be an
entirely different virus, with the same screen effect!

        Joseph asked if the author of the Bouncing Ball virus wrote
any new code, or just simply spliced a previously written routine to
the (c)Brain virus.  Well the bouncing ball routine has been floating
around in Public Domain for awhile, and other routines used in viri
tend to be culled from similar sources.  The falling letter routine,
which is also available in the public domain, is another example of
public domain code that has been added to viri.  The authors of these
viri do not even posses the creativity to code their own "joke"
routines.  A collection of such routines is available on a disk called
"Jokes" from Public Brand Software.  I am in no way affiliated with
PBS, and I am certain many other public domain clearing houses have
such a disk, I am just more familiar with PBS's catalogue.

    Cryptography can provide very strong tools for protecting computer
systems from virus attacks.  One particularly useful cryptographic
tool for eliminating viruses would be "cryptographic notarization".
The notorization would provide a strong sealing of the integrity of a
file or disk.  Software could be notarized by "certification
authorities".  The certification authorities would be distributed and
hierarchical.  This would allow every commercial software house to be
its own notorizing authority.
    The notorization would not prevent the distribution of malicious
code, but would provide strong integrity and traceability of the code.
For example, the integrity of a copy of LETUS-123 could be verified by
any user with this scheme.  This would provide strong proof of the
softwares origin and that it had not been modified.  If the LETUS-123
had any flaws or virus within it, it would be traceable to the
originating software house.
    In the ongoing discussion in this forum I have noticed several
misconceptions about cryptography.

>.................... a simple virus like Brain will spread regard-
>less of program encryption, because it attaches to code that could be
>stored encrypted.

    First cryptography is not just encryption.  Cryptography is
mechanism to provide many "security services" that include -
confidentiality, integrity, peer entity authentication, and data
origin authentication (see ISO 7498-2).  Contrary to the following
comment, any mechanism for a cryptographic protection mechanism must
be based on standards.

>Such an encryption system would only be useful if it were not
>standard.  If it became standard, or at least widely distributed,
>viruses would work their way around it .....

    To support the development of real cryptographic devices,
standards must be available to ensure interoperability.  The issues of
a virus working their way around an implementation are not relevant to
the development of the standards.  Only the local implementation of a
verification mechanism must be conserned with these issues.

    Standards already exist that could be used for these mechanisms.
Considerable work is available as a foundation from ISO (DIS 9594-8),
ECMA (TR/46), FIPS, ANSI, CCITT, and IEEE (802.10).  The challenge at
hand is then to integrate these existing mechanisms into a complete
system solution.  I would strongly recommend as a start for the
notorization system the ISO DIS 9594-8 specification, in combination
with RSA, and a DES MAC.

John,

You recently asked in the Virus mailing list about Macs throwing
things in the trashcan on their own.

Farralon Computing (sp?) now has available a product called "Timbuktu"
for networked Macs. This lets a user on one Mac watch and/or
manipulate any other Mac on the network that is also running Timbuktu.
It is a godsend for Mac network managers who have to clean up after
people who leave things in disarray, particularly when the Macs are in
several buildings.  It is a disaster when the users start using it on
their own.  Passwords are optional.

Your reporter may have seen this in use without being aware of it.

Your description of the Macintosh cursor picking up files and dragging
them to the trash with no user action sounds like Timbuktu may be
involved.  Timbuktu is a program that allows a user on one Macintosh
to control ANOTHER Macintosh across a network.

If, when this is happening, there is a small "hand" icon in the upper
right hand corner of the screen (in the menu bar) then it IS Timbuktu,
and someone else on the network is playing a stupid joke.  If not, you
may have stumbled across an interesting problem.

Any chance someone set up a macro that the users are playing back
without realizing they're doing it?

Subject:  PC Bouncing Ball virus (or is it?!)

I remember a program like this, only it wasn't a virus. (Note that I'm
not saying that *this* one isn't a virus!).

When the program was run, a smiley face would start bouncing around
the screen, rebounding off any text that was displayed. When the
screen scrolled, sometimes the face would get stuck between a bunch of
letters.

By pressing various combinations of keys you could increase or
decrease the number of faces. If you got rid of all of the faces, they
would come back after a period of activity (about half an hour, I
think). I seem to remember that it was supposed to survive a warm
reboot, but I can't be certain.

This was all a fair while ago. I think the program was called
FACE.COM, or something similar. It either came with a small document
file describing the various keys used, or it printed them up when the
program was run.

Sorry I can't be more precise. I still have a copy of the program, but
it is at home. If you are still interested, I can check up when I go
back in a couple of weeks for Easter. If this is the program you are
experiencing, then there is no need to worry - it is not a virus.
Turning the machine off will get rid of it. (Check the AUTOEXEC.BAT
file to check that it is not loaded when the machine is booted).

- -NOTE- The program described in this message may not be the one you are
       experiencing. Do not relax your security measures.
