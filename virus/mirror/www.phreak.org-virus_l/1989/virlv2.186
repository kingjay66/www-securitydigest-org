VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

|  On this disk the virus had replaced the file c/addbuffers, the size of this

|  The addbuffers command was the second in the startup sequence on this disk.

Neither.  It is normal behavior, given the circumstances.  It is obviously
not what you _want_ to happen, but then again, the proper answer in the
given situation is to _A_bort the operation and start again.

Could someone give me a brief description of Fedit+?  Freeware?  Shareware?
Why might it be better than ResEdit?

Where did the virus "VIENNA" get his name from?? Does anybody know
the answer?

Subject: Killvirus Antivirus Program Inconsistencies

I was running an old version of virus detective (v. 2.2.1, I think) on
a disk on whick I had downloaded a number of files from "MACSERVE at
PUCC".  The program, I belive, found what it identified as a virus in
the KILLLVIRUS software.  Upon "resEditing" I noticed what looked like
the following:

- -------------
|     .     |
|     .     |
|     .     |
| kVir      |
| nVir      |
|           |
- -------------

However, when crossed checked with Virus Detective no bells or
whistles were sounded.  Could this be a virus?  Or is it a bug in the
KILLVIRUS software?  Thank you very much for your assistance.

It is back-to-school time.  Throughout modern history this has been a
time for viruses to manifest themselves.  Students congregating in the
fall spread them like wildfire.

This is going to be particularly bad with computer viruses.  Copies
which have been lying dormant for the season on unused diskettes will be
put into use.

Good computer hygiene is going to be particulary important during the
next few weeks.  Encouraging good practice now may save you a lot of
grief during the next few weeks.

Does the Ping_pong virus travel on 3.5" diskettes?

Hi everyone.

Thank you, all people having provided me with some helps
  directly and via the list.

Here in Korea, nowadays many BBS's come to beings and plenty of
  people come to concern Communication. But also some viruses
  are reported recently, like some Brain viruses modified in
  Korea to change the configuration of AT, Hebru virus( maybe
  I misspell ), ANSI bomb and so on.
