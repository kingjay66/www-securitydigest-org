VIRUS-L Digest   Monday, 13 Nov 1989    Volume 2 : Issue 239

VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

     A new COM infector was submitted to the HomeBase board this
evening by Jean Luz of Lisbon, Portugal.  The virus is in many
respects similar to the Vienna virus - the size increase is 648 bytes,
and instead of overwriting every eigth file (on the average) with the
re-boot sequence, it overwrites with the characters "AIDS", thus
crippling those applications.  This virus shoulkd not be confused with
the original AIDS virus (very dissimilar).  Asside from the mentioned
similarities with Vienna, the virus appears to be written from
scratch.  The 648 length seems to be a chance result.  No effects of
the virus have been observed other than the above mentioned.  The
virus has been in Portugal at least two months according to the
submitter.  Alan

P.S.  The following presumably straight-faced request was posted on
HomeBase by John McAfee.  Thought it might be of interest to Virus-L
readers:

To: All Users
From: John McAfee
Subject: Reported Possible Virus

    I received an unusual call from a Mr. Fred Hankel of Fargo, North
Dakota this morning.  Mr. Hankel was highly agitated and after hearing his
long and involved story, I was moved to pass on this condensed summary to
all who might be interested:  Mr. Hankel reports, and I have no grounds for
doubting, that a computer virus invaded his system from a bingo game he
purchased in mid-October.  The virus activated at 11:00 A.M yesterday and
promply melted his power supply and mother board.  As he reached for the
power switch to turn off the machine, the virus blasted a perfectly circular
hole in the front panel of his AT clone and left a three foot oval scorch
mark on the back wall of his den.  I had not heard of this virus before
and felt that an alert might be in order.  Anyone experiencing similar
symptoms should contact us immediately.
Thank you.

[Ed. Sounds (to me) like paranoia strikes deep.  I trust that everyone
will have the good sense to take this report with a large grain of
salt...]

Subject: Interferon & The Vision Fund (Mac)

On behalf of the Vision Fund, I would like to thank everyone who has sent
in a Shareware donation for use of the Interferon program.  We have
collected a substantial amount of money that has gone to good use.

Now I have a request:  Please don't send in any more money!  Interferon
is now an obsolete program; Shareware programs like Disinfectant and
commercial programs like (plug, I wrote it) Virex are faster and better.
In addition, I've been told by my accountants that the informal structure
of the Vision Fund can cause me some tax problems if too much more money
comes in.

Therefore, I declare both Interferon and MandelColor (another Vision Fund
program) to be Freeware.  After a certain date, any cheques received made
out to the Vision Fund will be returned.  Any cash sent in, or cheques made
out to Yours Truly, will be spent on wooing women.

As much as I like Cliff Stoll, I still hate to be forced to sell his
book.  Nonetheless, I am force to agree with Ken on this: the book is
required reading.  It is so much so, that I do not even harbor any
qualms about saying so on the network.

Subject: Virus trivia (PC)

Just a few random bits of information....

        * A diskette infected with the Ohio virus will be immune to
          infection by the Brain and Den Zuk viruses, since it contains
          the signature of those two viruses.

        * The Vacsina virus can only properly infect a .COM file, so
          when it infects a .EXE file it will do so in two steps, first
          change it into a .COM file by overwriting the 4D 5A signature
          with a JMP instruction and placing a 132 byte loader program
          at the end of the file. The next time this program gets infected
          it will be infected just like any other .COM file.

        * Almost all .EXE infecting viruses place the virus code at the end
          of the infected file. One virus, sURIV 2.0 does not. It will insert
          itself just after the header of the program it infects.

And one question.. What language is "Den Zuk" ? I thought it was Dutch for
"The search", but I have been told that it is not.

I agree whole-heartedly!  Please *do*not* mention this alleged virus -
the paranoia the initial reports of this alleged virus have given way
to is damage enough.  There is still *no* evidence that this virus
ever existed.

Since my initial postings on this subject, I have received a couple of
files that, it was thought, might have been infected by this alleged
virus.  I found no indication of any virus (or anything at all out of
the ordinary) in those files.

Once again, there is still *no* evidence that this virus ever existed.
If new evidence surfaces, this disucssion can continue, but at the
moment there's no evidence and, consequently, nothing to discuss.  The
end.

No, it's harder.  Most of the items which I consider sophisticated
require fairly fancy programming which requires code space, data
space, and CPU time, each of which is at a premium in most PCs.  A
really sophisticated virus, one targeted for UNIX, for instance, could
easily approach or exceed a megabyte in size.  You just can't do that
on most PCs, and users would notice even if you could.

On the other hand you don't need to.  MS-DOS systems are so trivial
that it's difficult to build a good virus detector and there are no
inherent security systems.  Viruses don't need to be sophisticated.

I didn't add that because that's not usually one of the "survival"
traits, but rather is used in propagation and/or infection.  I have a
fairly lengthy document on the kinds of things a real sophisticated
virus might do in each stage (what I showed before was a subset of
this document).  I consider the document sensitive so I am wary of
posting it.

Hi all,
      Well it seems I have been guilty of incorrect attribution
of an article I forwarded for Aryeh Goretsky... The forward was NOT
officially from the CVIA nor does it represent an official opinion
of th CVIA. The forward was from Aryeh Goretsky who was not acting
in any official capacity for the CVIA. Here I am redfaced indeed!!
my fault only in the incorrect attribution...
           cheers

    Yet another virus has been reported and sampled in the Seattle
area.  The virus is a COM, EXE and Overlay infector that increases the
size of infected files by 1644 bytes.  It activates on Sundays and
displays the message: "Today is Sunday!  Why do you work so hard?  All
work and no play make you a dull boy."  File allocation table damage
has been reported in two instances, although we could not dupliacte
the FAT problem on our test systems.
    McAfee is planning to put SCAN49 out on Tuesday.  49 will detect
this Sunday virus, the Lisbon Virus and Yuval Tal's Do Nothing virus
(He sounds pretty haggard over the phone and begins to snarl if the
words "new virus" are mentioned).

Subject: Re: Identify Ashar Virus (PC)

It has been pointed out to me (hello Kelly!) that I may have been less
than gracious in my response to the report of "ld viruses found."
Certainly no offence was meant to John McAfee, and I hope none was
taken.

However, actual bug details aside, the point I was making that the
user of a virus-detector has to have absolute trust in it, and any
errant behaviour by the program can only weaken that trust, no matter
who the author is.  Certainly, a failure to correctly report the
number of viruses found would seem to imply a lack of testing.

Virus detectors must not only be above reproach, they must be SEEN to
be above reproach.

Anyone here read comp.risks/RISKS-L ?
