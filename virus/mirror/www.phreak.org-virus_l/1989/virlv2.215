Subject: IBM-supplied antivirus software (IBM PC)

 Below is the text of an announcement recently made by IBM. We got this
 from our IBM representative. It's not particularly clear to me
 exactly which viruses this software works for, but I thought I'd
 pass it along. There is a number to call for more information.

                                                 September 29, 1989
 MEMORANDUM TO: IBM Business Partners

 SUBJECT:       Personal Computer Virus Detection

 There is an increasing awareness in the industry of the existence of
 disruptive computer viruses.  Several personal computer viruses exist
 which are expected to activate after October 12, 1989.  These viruses
 can erase a DOS or OS/2* file or render the files on the fixed disk
 inaccessible.  Although the number of reported occurrences is low, this
 is to alert you to the potential risk of these viruses and to provide
 you with a program to assist you in detecting them.

 Enclosed are 3.5 inch and 5.25 inch diskettes with the IBM Virus
 Scanning Program for personal computers and its license agreement.  At
 your discretion, you may make copies for your customers.  Also included
 are a fact sheet on the IBM Virus Scanning Program and a virus question
 and answer document.

 We recommend that you and your customers run the IBM Virus Scanning
 Program on all of your personal computers using DOS and/or OS/2 as soon
 as possible prior to October 12th.

 If you provide customers a copy of these diskettes, you must also pro-
 vide them with a copy of the license agreement.  To ensure a virus free
 copy, you must follow the instructions in the READ.ME file on the
 diskette.  You should "write protect" all copies of the original disk-
 ettes.  The READ.ME file also contains additional information on the
 IBM Virus Scanning Program.  There is a $35.00 charge for this program.
 Payment is to be made by the customer directly to:

                  IBM Corporation
                  Grand Central Station
                  P.O. Box 2646
                  New York, NY 10163

 Alternatively, your customer may order the IBM Virus Scanning Program
 (part number 64F1424) at a cost of $35.00, with a major credit card,
 directly from the IBM fulfillment center by calling 1-800-426-7282.

                 IBM Virus Scanning Program Fact Sheet
 +               _____________________________________

 WARNING - BEFORE USING THE IBM VIRUS SCANNING PROGRAM MAKE CERTAIN
 THAT THE COPY YOU INTEND TO USE COMES FROM A SECURE UNINFECTED SOURCE,
 AND THAT THE DISKETTES' WRITE PROTECT TAB IS IN PLACE IF THE DISKETTE
 IS NOT PERMANENTLY WRITE PROTECTED.

 The IBM Virus Scanning Program has been developd by IBM to aid in the
 detection of some computer viruses and is being used internally by IBM
 to detect computer viruses.  The program is designed to scan boot
 records and executable files looking for signatures of viruses known to
 IBM when the program was written.  A signature is a bit pattern that is
 indicative of a particular virus.  The files that are scanned by the IBM
 Virus Scanning Program must be in their native executable form (e.g.,
 not encrypted and not packed) in order for signature matching to occur.
 There may be other viruses that currently exist, or will exist in the
 future, that the IBM Virus Scanning Program will not detect.  We know
 of no available, guaranteed solution to computer viruses, so we
 recommend regular backups of your data, caution in acquiring and using
 software and good security practices.

 Description of the IBM Virus Scanning Program
 +_____________________________________________

 The program tests executable files on disks for signature strings that
 are found in some common DOS computer viruses.  For each drive specified
 it will also test the drive for boot sector viruses.

 To use it, simply type at the command prompt (for example)

     VIRSCAN C:  to scan the executable files on the C: drive
        or
     VIRSCAN A:  to scan the executable files on the A: drive
        or
     VIRSCAN n: n: n:  to scan multiple drives (n = drive id)

 Type VIRSCAN without any arguments for some help.

     Files infected with a virus should be erased and replaced with
     uninfected copies (obtained from the original source, such as
     original manufacturer's diskettes, in-house source code, backup
     copies, etc).

     NOTE:  Prior to restoring any files, run the program against
            the diskette from which you plan to restore to ensure
            it is virus-free.

 Technical Detail:
 +________________

 VIRSCAN.EXE is the executable program.  It will run under DOS 2.0, 2.1,
 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 4.0 and OS/2* 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2.  It will not support
 OS/2 1.2 with high performance file system names.

 Virus detection programs and services are available from other companies
 and you may also wish to advise your customers of these.  The IBM Virus
 Scanning Program will not detect all personal computer virus possibili-
 ties and should be considered complementary to, and not a substitute
 for, established security and backup procedures.

 If you have any questions, please call the NDD National Support Center
 at 1-800-IBM-PROD or contact your IBM marketing representative.

That's not true for the sample that I've seen.  I suspect someone's
just misreading the code (it's easy to do; that area is rather
convoluted).  It could be a new variant, of course, but if it really
*did* do its damage between Jan 1 and Oct 12, wouldn't it have
basically Gone Off by now?  I think your source is just misinformed.
There does seem to be a day-of-the-week check in there, but I'm not
sure what it does at the moment (not damaging on Sundays is possible,
but I wouldn't want to promise anyone!).

In summary, the important differences that I know of between the
DataCrime (1168 and 1280 strains) and the DataCrime II are that
the II:
  - Makes COM files 1514 bytes longer when it infects them
  - Also infects EXE files
  - Stores itself garbled on disk (except for the degarbler)
  - Has a slightly different message ("* DATACRIME II VIRUS *")

Otherwise, it's the same beast, with the same damage conditions.
Of course there may be more variants that I haven't seen!

Subject: The not so new virus (Mac)

Enclosed is a mail message written by a fellow consultant.

  When it first appears, it's just a form of the nVIR virus which AntiPan
  works very well to eradicate.  But it seems to be a self modifying code
  which causes it to mutate to an unrecognizable form.  SO, what do we do
  about it, you ask?

  Well, we have had exceedingly good success in both TAGGING and ERADICATING
  the virus with a program called SYMANTEC ANTI-VIRUS CLINIC.  If the virus
  is tagged, it can be eradicated with AntiPan, or it can be eradicated with
  SAM, the SYMANTEC ANTI-VIRUS CLINIC.  So when people bring you their disks
  to have checked, please run SAM on them.  It's very easy, there will be
  instructions at the desk.

Copies of this message and an infected application will be sent to all those
who requested copies, and any others who also ask.
This is _not_ an endorsement of any sort for SAM, or Anti-pan.

Here on Chalmers, we've found an STR id 801 in the game MORIA
(Recently posted on comp.binaries.mac), I havent gotten time to check
it yet byt it *might* have come with moria.  (Altough some signs seam
to indicate that it has been around for a long time) Any information
on the virus, It's effects and possible techniques to combat it will
be geatly appriciated.

Subject: Viruses that inhabit "bad" blocks (PC)

     I was just reading about the OGRE virus when I noticed a pattern.
Since a lot (is it a lot?) of viruses mark the sectors they are using
as bad, why not just write a utility that will look up the bad sectors
on a disk and erase them.  There are utilities available now that will
analyze EACH sector on a disk to see if it is bad or not.  If it is
marked bad, but seems ok they will put that sector back into the
available sector list.  I think SpinRight (sp?) and perhaps PCTools do
this.  Even if not all of the virus is eradicated, it seems that it
would at least be fatally crippled.  Has anyone tried this?

I don't know about the Mac... its system software is a lot cleaner
than Messy-DOS, albeit rather unconventional. But this is pretty
much impossible with MS-DOS. I suspect you would have to write a
complete new operating system with an MS-DOS emulator. The reason for
this is that the original MS-DOS was so incompetant (for example,
the serial driver code never worked right for anything better than
dumping to a printer, and it's never been fixed) that any decent
program was forced to go direct to the hardware. And of course if
you're going to go to a new O/S, why not use an off-the-shelf one
that's already achieved wide acceptance?

I once sat down and tried to write a terminal emulator that was
entirely well-behaved.  I was able to keep up with 1200 baud using the
XT bios to put stuff on the screen, by heavy use of curses-style
heuristics, but I broke down and went straight to the serial port.

Of course, OS/2 is supposed to fix all this. For some bizzarre reason,
though, it's still got no security features.

Anyway, the reason Apple and IBM aren't doing anything is because
there's no great call from the user community to do anything, and
nobody's willing to consider a better alternative if it means risking
their cherished soft- ware investment. Which is only reasonable, but
there's no reason new installations can't be based on something like
UNIX.

Subject: Tiger Teams (General)

Hi,
     I think that your average non-sophisticated user would be
offended by computer support personnel checking their personal
machine for "infection".  An alternative would be to have the
Tiger Teams simply state that they are doing "regular preventative
maintenance".  People shouldn't have problems with that.  The end
user doesn't need to know the gruesome details of a PM call.
     Actually Tiger Team duties should be assigned to a companys
regular maintenance people (with a software expert supervising
them of course).  I guess the best anti-virus protection is one
that is both transparent to the end user and in the hands of a
well trained support staff.
     The original Tiger Team idea would work best if slightly
modified.  Every football team has both an offence and a defense.
Right now the anti-viral defense really has no one to practice
against.  I think what we need is a group of developers that will
try to "bust" Gatekeeper/Flushot/etc.  These people would be
in close contact with the anti-viral developers.  The Tiger Team
would document their methods and only use benign infections.
     I guess my real concern is that anti-virus developers take
a reactive stance instead of an active one.  If I were a anti-virus
developer, I would want to encounter a new infection method under
controlled, documented conditions.  This way anti-viral SW would
be guarded against bypass methods already thought up by the Tiger
Teams.
     Also, do any anti-viral programs use the 'bad block' method
to protect themselves?  I think that idea holds some promise.

Subject: New Mac Virus Not In 'Moria' But in SuperClock3.5!

Today when I had time to check the various downloads that had been occuring
during the last few days I found that the recource STR ID 801 appeared
in the document Clock Doc (a word document). I double checked this by
extracting it from the .sit archive again and examinig it directly
(On Cue from StuffIt to ResEdit). Since Stuffit and Resedit seems to be
clean from this and othe known viruses I can only assume that the virus
was there when Clock Doc was packaged!
What I'm wondering now is: Is it confirmed that the STR ID 801 really *is*
a sign of a virus? Is there any chance that it is a legitimate resource?
(I've tested making new MacWrite documents with a locked copy, They have
 resources this 'International Resource' and a STR resource ID 701,
None of them have had a STR ID 801) Clock Doc comes with the
SuperClock! 3.5 INIT Recently posted to the comp.binaries.mac
newsgroup.  I'm sorry for causing constenation by proclaming Moria as
a possible source, (Frankly, That .sit archive had been deleted so I
couldn't check it, But since the known infected machines both had
Superclock 3.5 installed within the last few days, Moria hav dropped
off the list of prime suspects)

        This is a very interesting virus.  However, I would like to
know if anyone knows how it originally infects a disk.  It would seem
that it would have to be in an executable program at least initially
(to infect the first disk).

        Any ideas?
