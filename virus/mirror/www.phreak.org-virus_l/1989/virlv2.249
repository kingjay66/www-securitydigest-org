So what if I remove system patches? You seem to think that I need to
call every little routine in ROM to do my dirty stuff. What I need is
say, ChangedResource, WriteResource and perhaps AddResource. What do
these traps have to do with OS traps? How many system patches are
there for these traps?  Do you *really* think that the ROM is truly
and utterly worthless without the system patches? Do you think they
wrote routines that didn't work at all and then patched them into
working? Why would I care if there is some small and obscure bug in
the ROM that could make my virus crash with prob. .000001%, after all
that is probably the whole idea with the virus after all!!

I don't claim that the ROM is bug free, but your indirect claim that
every trap is buggy is pretty heavy. (I got that from the "fact" that
everything will kill the machine "for sure", in case you wonder).

This proves you've missed the point entirely. We're not talking about well
behaved viruses here. And just because you think no one would write one isn't
exactly proof that no one will...

I do think they are significant though. The whole point with my post in the
first place was to make people realize that a virus could bypass the
protective fences of all anti-viral programs (including Gatekeeper) pretty
easily (theoretically anyway). What if a virus changed the resource map
directly without going through the ROM at all? We can't just rely on the
trivial and obvious protection that Gatekeeper et al. provies. What we need
is sophisticated protection schemes, and unless there's no discussion of
potential viruses we might never come up with these schemes in time.

Subject: 2600 VAX Virus (VMS) ?

I have just read "The complete Computer Virus Handbook" (issue 1)
written by David Frost.

In it, is described a virus called 2600 VAX virus. Basically a
programm which replicates itself and sends job requests to the batch
queue, which is a list of jobs awaiting execution. The so-called
"virus" caused the queue to overflow...

This was reported in a 1986 edition of the magazine 2600, a hacker
journal.

Well, to me it looks just like a recursive batch program. A two-liner.
We've often had students at our site writing this simple piece of
code, and submitting it to the queue. It surely wastes a lot of paper
(when printing the log files of the program), especially if run at
night, with no operator finding-out that the whole stack of paper
feeding the printer will be printed with garbage !

But does this simple piece of code really need to be mentioned in a
"Virus handbook" ? Did the next issues of this manual still mention
this ?

Subject: More on Signature Progs

My epistle of several days ago regarding ANSI and ISO Message
Authentication Code (digital signature) standards generated quite a
few follow-up responses and other questions. Several people asked me
about my internet address. Most of you guessed correctly. I can get to
internet either via NCSC's "dockmaster" or through CompuServe.
Although CompuServe is more expensive, it is a lot more convenient for
me because I've got a "user-friendly" application for my PC that
automates most of my interaction with CompuServe.

What this means to internet users is that you can send electronic mail
to and receive mail from CompuServe subscribers IF both of the
following conditions are true:

1- You must know the CompuServe account (subscriber) number

2- The CompuServe subscriber must actively access CompuServe and
send/receive mail.

CompuServe subscriber numbers generally look a lot like mine
(71435,1777) and consist of two numeric fields separated by a comma.
In order to convert a CompuServe subscriber number into an internet
address, replace the comma with a period, and append the suffix
"@COMPUSERVE.COM". Thus, when addressing me through CompuServe, my
internet address is:

71435.1777@COMPUSERVE.COM

A lot of other people sent me mail requesting ways to get hold of the
ANSI and ISO standards I referenced.

Copies of ANSI standard X9.9 can be obtained by sending $2.00 to:

ANSI X9 Secretariat

I am less familiar with ISO than with ANSI. I got my copy of ISO
8731-2 from ANSI because I am a member of the X9E9 working group. But
I believe you can get a copy of ISO standard 8731-2 by writing to:

Steve Wornick commented on the value of sophisticated,
cryptographically based signature programs as follows:

Industry-standard authentication algorithms such as X9.9 (DES based)
and ISO 8731-2 are NOT intended to encrypt files. They produce a short
"digest" or signature of information (in this case a program file).
Steve's suggestion that CRC algorithms can be sophisticated enough to
make guessing virtually impossible (if the algorithm itself is hidden)
MAY or MAY NOT be true. The risk that this assumption MAY NOT be true
is fairly high, especially if programmers rely on their own resources
on how to write a bunch of different yet "good" CRC algorithms. This
is even more true if the test is "on-line", because on-line
authentication implies on-line presence of the authentication
algorithm, where a sophisticated virus could determine the CRC
algorithm and/or associated initialization vectors (keys).

Today, in late 1989, Steve can make and defend the position that CRC
algorithms are good enough, especially if programmers are
knowledgeable about the security considerations, and if the signature
is calculated and verified "off-line" in environments where no virally
contaminated programs have a chance of grabbing executional control.
But in my opinion, this position is short-sighted. Who can say whether
the more sophisticated viruses of the future will attempt to analyze
CRC signatures or target specific products that rely on CRC methods?
Why not base today's protection on the best available and best
documented facts?  The newly emerging science of authentication
technology has clearly revealed that it is easier to compromise even
sophisticated authentication algorithms than previously thought.

What kind of "malicious attack against your product" are you talking
about? Whatever it is, I'm sure the other members of the ANSI
standards (X9E9) working group and I would be very interested in
learning about it, because if this assertion is true, it could
possibly compromise the entire banking wire-funds transfer mechanism
that transfers billions of dollars every day. Are you saying you could
write or describe a virus that could infect a program but avoid
detection by an off-line ANSI X9.9-based message authentication code?
I'll acknowledge that this is possible with an on-line ANSI X9.9 MAC,
but it would take a lot of blind luck and something on the order of a
billion guesses. The consensus among standards organizations has been
that this is an acceptable risk in the case of the authentication
algorithms that have been studied and standardized.  As I said in my
earlier message, in my experience both on-line and off-line checks
have advantages and disadvantages, and a sophisticated defense must
allow users to pick and choose from all of these techniques according
to his needs. A heirarchy of interlocking defenses must be put
together, with on-line tests acting as the first line of defense, and
with periodic off-line checks. The on-line checks can detect the
viruses known today, and the off-line checks verify the integrity of
the on-line defenses and also protect against sophisticated future
viruses.

Subject: EAGLE.EXE Trojan (PC)

    The Jerusalem and AIDS viruses reported inside AXE'd files are
similar to dozens of other AXE'd viruses reported on Bulletin Boards
in the past 5 months.  Viruses discovered compressed in such files
have included 1701, 1704, AIDS, Jerusalem (over 20 samples), Vienna,
3066, Alabama, Dark Avenger, Yankee Doodle, Vacsina, Fu Manchu and
Datacrime I.  I'm not sure that developing identifiers for these AXE'd
files is the appropriate thing to do, since there are a virtually
unlimited number of hosts that may be included insidecompressed files.
Also, each version of AXE will produce different strings for the same
executable target.  So far, files like EAGLE.EXE have been treated as
trojans (even though they may contain replicating code) since the
compressed file itself cannot replicate.  Any string that identifies
the virus in the compressed form will not identify it in the free
form, and each virus has an uncountable number of potential compressed
identification strings, since each compressed infected host will be
different.  A thorny problem if we try to tackle it.  I don't believe
we should treat EAGLE any differently than GUNSHIP, BADGIRL or the
dozens of other compressed files that contain previously well known
viruses.

Not only does it send itself to everyone in the files NAMES and NETLOG,
but also:

The advice given was:

(Quotes from: Joachim Lohoff-Werner)

I'd recommend editing this EXEC so that the spreading and damage part
is removed *completely*, make it read-only, and use it.  After all, it
*does* perform a useful function!  The only problem lies in getting a
bad copy again.  You'd be deleting your own files and starting another
outbreak!

So, once you've gotten it, *then* delete any more incoming (*bad*)
copies.  Just make @#$% sure your copy isn't going to erase your files
in 1990, or spread.

1) A new or existing virus is developed and produced as a linkable
   object file.

2) Said object file is then either directly linked into an executable
   file at link time, or placed in a run-time library.

Is this even a remote possibility? If so, does anyone have any examples

Subject: Traceback (PC)

We recently ran into a problem. A user reported that a hard disk
drive in daily use, had only one file on it. The file was named
tracebck.com or another spelling of the virus name.

The disk label was @traceback and as mentioned all files were
deleted except the one file mentioned. SCAN.EXE identified the
Traceback virus as being present in the file.

Anyone recognize this? Unfortunately the user INSISTED that a
low level format be done on the disk, and could not wait for
someone with some knowledge to get there. The technician did a
screen dump of the SCAN.EXE report and then formatted the disk.

Does this sound familiar to anyone? If so, does the low level format
get rid of the virus? The files were restored from master disks and
as far as we know, the master are not infected.

This virus was written two years ago in Wellington, New Zealand.
The author, who has been identified, was a high-school student,
who is now at university.  It seems that another individual
however was responsible for the spreading of the virus.

Geographical Note: New Zealand is *not* part of Australia.

>Has anyone here seen such a virus?

Ive been working on several virus (or worms) for the Apple since I
read about them back in 86. Since all I had was an Apple IIe, I really
had to come up with some weird ideas for implementation for my
experiments.

What I came up with (in church one night!) was to use a text file that
could be EXEC'd from BASIC (or from the HELLO [startup] program on the
boot disk) that would execute the commands in that text file. This
text file would write a program to memory, that would go and patch
other startup programs with the text file, or a smaller version of it.
No assembly used (I was ignarant back then), and all of it was done in
BASIC with the EXEC'able text files. The programs were REALY difficult
to follow; commands that were writing commands to do DOS functions.
But it worked, and I infected an entire BASIC.101 class in 2 days. By
having the worms cross checking the copy counter (max==21), they
"knew" when they got everyone, and promtly killed themselves without
anyone knowing.

We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, I know that that ain't allowed_

Subject: Eddie ? (PC)

I was wondering about a text string that appears inside the Dark Avenger
virus:
                Eddie lives...somewhere in time

Wasn't there a character named Eddie in a horror movie ? If so, did this
sentence appear there ?
