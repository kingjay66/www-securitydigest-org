I'm afraid I can't agree with you, Martin.  Warranty implies that the
product was purchased and you are following the terms of the purchase
agreement.  The trojan runs for a time and then demands that you pay
for the product (Which, as it has been presented appears to be a
demo.)  If you don't pay the price, the trojan, in effect, kidnaps
your data and holds it for ransom.

Illegal, or at least extremely Immoral (presumably the former).

Subject: Motivation behind the AIDS trojan

Like everyone who's heard of this thing, we here have been asking
"What are they trying to accomplish that makes them willing to spend
this much money?"

I've come up with a model for their motivation which I think explains
everything. I'd be very interested in any reactions to it:

1. They deliberately distributed two versions of the program. One
version fires immediately, while the other stays silent for 90
reboots. I'll call these "scrambled" and "infected" systems
respectively.

2. It is my guess that there are very few copies of the
fire-immediately version. It is my guess that this version was
deliberately mailed later than the others.

3. The purpose of the fire-immediately version is to make an example
of a few users. It is my guess that the authors thought they had
hidden things sufficiently well that a person who knew his system was
infected still could not find and remove the infection. This then
explains why the scrambled systems indentify clearly which program
caused the scrambling.

4. Therefore: A lot of people receive the disks "for free" and install
immediately. Infection becomes rampant.

5. A few people get their systems scrambled immediately. Word gets out
that the program is dangerous - but not immediately in most cases.

6. People with infected systems are given 90 reboots (presumably at
least a couple of months under normal usage) to send in their money
and get a dis-infector disk back.

7. Each system derives part of its encryption key from local
information. Thus the dis-infector disk can only be used on the system
for which it was returned. An organization with 10 infected systems
has to pay 10 times, and receive 10 disks.

8. The money must be sent through a dummy corporation in Panama, with
its notoriously unstrict banking laws. Payment is in US dollars
because that's what Panamanian banks deal in.

9. For a person whose system is infected but not yet scrambled, an
obvious tactic is to do a file-by-file backup onto disks or tape (as
opposed to a block-level backup), followed by a disk reformat and
rebuild, and restoration of the files. To thwart that end, I predict
that the trojan has inserted itself into one or more executable files
which would be expected to be retrieved in the backup. This may not
include the full encryption algorithm - a simple "destroy all data and
make the disk image unusable" would do. If several people get nailed
in this way, word spreads and most people won't try to escape this way
anymore. [If one is careful about what is restored and what gets
recovered from original release disks, this approach should be pretty
safe. But the kind of people who would routinely install a program
like this in the face of a "shrink-wrap" license are likely to have
other software they use for which original release disks are not
readily available. It would be my guess that such programs would be
particularly inviting targets. Likewise, the process of a file-by-file
backup and restore on an almost full 100 MB. disk is not a pleasant
prospect. It might actually cost more in floppy disks and time than
the decryptor costs.]

10. The reason the disk was not distributed in the US and that the
"license" doesn't allow it to be used here is that the behavior of
this program is in direct violation of the federal "virus" law. It
would be very interesting to know if there are any directly applicable
statute in Great Britain preventing this kind of activity. If not,
then the authors of this would be outside of the purvue of criminal
law, and protected against civil suit by their "license". They might
actually get away with it.

11. The motivation behind all this, then, is extortion. The cover
story of an AIDS database may or may not be a sick attempt at an
analogy. It may instead be a deliberate choice of a subject likely to
intrigue many people into installing the program on their systems.
(No-one has made any comment about what, if any, cover program is on
the distribution disk. Does it really contain an AIDS database?)

12. Lastly, it is my guess that the authors have badly underestimated
both the quantity and quality of the effort which has been and will be
applied to defending against this trojan (see point 3 above). This
story is not yet completely written, though - it may be that only the
first layer of defenses have been opened to our vision, and that this
thing runs much deeper (see point 9 above).

13. How do we find them?
        a. Follow the bank accounts from which the mailing lists were bought
           and from which the rent money in London was paid. (Probably tough.)
        b. Follow the bank accounts in Panama. (Forget it!)
        c. Send in your money and try to figure out where the decryptor
           disk was sent. (IF it gets sent. There is no guarantee that
           they'll follow through on the bargain.)
        d. Try to trace where they bought their computers originally
           to do the development. (Sure thing.)
        e. Just where DO we (editorial "we") start looking, and what do we
           do with them when they're found? Is there actually any way to
           bring these guys to justice under British, Swedish or West German
           law? Could they be extradited from Nigeria or somewhere like that?

Subject: WDEF protection strategy for servers (Mac)

    Just an idea that may make most of our lives a bit easier.  On our
servers at SMU students often save their papers on the system disks.
Well as anybody knows this is not cool when they fill up.  Soo I throw
them away.  Not nice but I thought it got the job done until I noticed
that the desktop remembers the icons (and other stuff) that these
files contained.  Sooo I did some thinking and locked the desktops.
The result is that when papers are saved their icon's are not so
throwing them away still restores the disk to it's original free
space.  Hmmmmm (I said to my self) Wouldn't this work well in
preventing those disks from getting WDEF?  If the message from the
last Virus-l was true then this should halt the spread of our new
little virus.  But only use it if you do not expect the contents of
your disk to change - as in adding or removing files.  I hope this
works.

Subject: WDEF virus.... (Mac)

Sure enough, my Mac II had WDEF on it.  It's first attack (on four
partitions) was December 9.  Funny thing was, immediately prior to my
discovery of this virus, my Mac II had been experiencing these same
symptoms of slow-closing windows.  In fact, it was common for the
mouse-depression lines in the go-away box of the window to take up to
5 seconds to appear and for the window to close.  This follows what
has been said about the virus earlier.  The other problem I had (which
has now gone away since erradication 5 days ago) was that when opening
a large file from the HD (Rodime, 140 Meg, Internal), it would often
crash during the read, and MacBugs would say it was damaged.  This
scared me because I haven't done a backup since September (I know, I
know no flames please), and this crash was coupled with the sound that
the HD makes when it starts up (you Rodime people know what I mean -
that click, and spinning sound).  Anyway, the problem has gone away,
and those same files open fine now that WDEF is gone.  Anyone else had
this problem?

As a side note, every single Mac on campus is infected near as I can
tell.  One lab with ~80 macs was infected in all 10 macs I randomly
sampled.  I gave the lab-room operator a copy of Disinfectant 1.5, but
he (get this) was unsure what to do with it.  I hope they've cleaned
it up.  If this thing (WDEF) passes from disk to disk just by
inserting an infected disk into a mac, can you imagine the headache
created by users who have they're own disks?  The whole lab can become
reinfected in one day.  What a mess.

Subject: AIDS TROJAN STAGE 2 UPDATE (PC)

Forgot to mention this in yesterday's update. Sorry about that!

PKSCRYPT.EXE is a fine shareware program designed by Lloyd Miller in
Canada, a year or two ago. It is a public key encryption program
and can be used (at least SWE used it) to decrypt files encrypted by
the AIDS trojan. It is available on many BBS's and Lloyd runs a FIDO
BBS in Canada.It is available at (201) 249-1898 as CRYPT.ZIP

Start off using 13 digit (numbers not characters) decryption keys.
Three of the digits will be the major and minor numbers of your DOS
version. For example DOS 4.01 would be 401, etc; Two of the digits will
be the last two digits in the length of command.com if it was on the
disk when stage two was triggered.

It is not yet known what is used for these two digits if command.com
was not present.

Hope this helps somewhat!

Is anyone aware of any attempts to actually *pay* for these disks?
I'm curious as to what sort of response this would meet.  Also, is the
information on these disks of any worth, or can one claim the "AIDS
information" is just a ploy to propagate a Trojan?  Perhaps this is
really a monumental blunder in the name of copy protection.

Subject: AIDS Trojan Update #4 (PC)

A forward from John McAfee:
==========================================================================

        It's now reasonably certain that there exists only one version
of the AIDS Trojan that has been mailed so far.  All copies that have
been reported so far (31) have the same file size - 146188, date -
9-28-89, and time - 4:28 P.  File compares have been performed on nine
of the 31 samples and they compare exactly.  All have been programmed
in Microsoft Quick Basic Version 3 and none have padding bytes at
either end of the program.  The samples have been taken from England,
Germany, Sweden, Finland, France and the one reported case in the U.S.
Diskettes from two different mailing lists were included in the
sample.
        The significant reported contradictions in the behaviour of
the trojan now appear to be cleared up.  The difference in the
reported activation trigger is now known to be caused by the varying
inputs to the AIDS Information program when it is executed.  The
Information program modifies the count field according to the final
"score" on the quiz.  Those who fall in the high risk categories are
given the most time; those whose answers place them in low risk
categories have their count fields decremented substantially.  If the
AIDS program is never executed, the user has 90 reboots before
activation.
        The reported differences in the occurance of the SHARE.EXE
program after activation are now known to be caused by differences in
printer configurations and printer status.  If no printer is attached
to LPT1, or if the printer is turned off after the initial activation,
no SHARE.EXE program of share message is produced.
        The encryption of the file names and extensions is now also
known to be constant for all samples.  There is no encryption key or
encryption algorithm.  The file names are modified by using a simple
character substitution which is constant for all samples and execution
environments.  The extensions are likewise substituted.  For example:
All COM files are given the extension AK, EXE files are changed to AU
and BAT files are changed to AG.  If a file extension is unknown to
the trojan, then it leaves the extension as is.  Disappointingly
trivial, considering the complexity of the remainder of the trojan
code.
        It is also known now that the INSTALL program will place and
activate the time bomb with or without the accompanying AIDS program.
This seems to imply that the install program may have been written for
additional purposes.  Watch out for potential additional mailings
covering completely different subject matter.

Subject: Legal Ramifications of PC-Cyborg License

I too would like to hear the opinions of a competent legal counsel
regarding the legality of PC-Cyborg's actions.  I feel that the
current crop of microcomputer licenses bear more resemblance to the
screenplay for a con job, than a contract describing a reasonable use
of a product for a reasonable compensation.  For a long time, there
have been laws in effect that state that a product purchased should
perform in a manner similar to the way that it is advertised.  A
article of machinery purchased as a "car" should perform at least
minimally as a "car".  In the absence of pride, responsibility, and
craftsmanship on the part of the maker, the law should be written to
protect the consumer; a license disclaiming all connection with the
product except the collection of profit does not do this.  Law is like
programming; the media the artist works in is the imagination, and
vision is only limited by the limitations that are inherited from
history.  Make the law serve the people, not the lawyers.

Subject: The missing viruses (PC)

A few PC viruses have been reported but not made generally available
to the virus research community. The "missing" viruses are listed
below. If anyone can confirm the existence of any of them, I would
appreciate it.

2730. It seems that this "virus" does not exist.

Agiplan. This virus was described in a W-German newspaper. It is a bit
        similar to the "Zero-Bug" virus. Both add 1536 bytes to the start
        of .COM programs they infect.

Fallboot. A BSV that is reported by the VIRSCAN program from IBM. Produces
        a display similar to that produced by 1701/1704.

Missouri, Nichols. Two boot sector viruses that were reported by
        McAfee/Homebase, but are not included in a recent list by him.

Screen. Reported by Ross Greenberg, it may be just a variant of the South
        African virus. Ross said it was uploaded to his BBS earlier this
        year. He described it in an article in BYTE.

Jerusalem variants. Of the 13-14 different Jerusalem variants, only five
        are "available".

Palette. Adds 1538 bytes to .COM files.

In addition the following viruses have been mentioned, but probably they
do not exist:

Cookie. .COM infector

Retro

Hyperspace

The rest of the PC viruses is probably in the hands of most virus researchers
by now.
