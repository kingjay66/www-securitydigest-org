Subject: A New VIRUS Conference

   The Computer Security Institute has put together a pretty interesting
   sounding conference in early May.  Details follow:

           COMPUTER VIRUSES '89 at the IBM & DEC Users Conference
               May 1-3, 1989 * Hyatt Regency O'Hare * Chicago
                  Sponsored by Computer Security Institute

                              PROGRAM OVERVIEW

* Partial list of speakers addressing virus-related topics:

     Eugene H. Spafford, Purdue University, will present an in-depth
          analysis of the Internet worm incident.

     Michael Karels, head of UNIX development at UC Berkeley and an
          Internet worm "swat team" member, will discuss how UNIX is
          meeting the virus challenge.

     Kenneth R. van Wyk, creator of Lehigh University's VIRUS-L bulletin
          board, who led the fight against the Lehigh virus, will talk
          about lessons learned.

     Richard D. Pethia, Carnegie Mellon University, will describe the
          first DARPA CERT (Computer Emergency Response Team), which he
          heads.

     Davis McCown, prosecutor in the "Texas Virus Trial" which
          convicted Donald Gene Burleson in September 1988, will
          recount the investigation, the trial, and what was learned.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* "Live" demonstrations of viruses, hacking, bulletin boards:

     Ross Greenberg, author of FLU_SHOT+, will demo viruses and describe
          PC Magazine's evaluation of 11 anti-virus products.

     Thomas V. Sobczak of Application Configured Computers will
          demonstrate hacking, underground bulletin boards, virus
          behavior, and public domain solutions.

     John McAfee, Computer Virus Industry Association, will demonstrate
          virus and anti-virus programs and present new statistical
          information on viruses.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Information on new security-related products:

     CA-ACF2/VAX and CA-Top Secret/VAX, which can help unify security and
          access control in mixed IBM-DEC shops.

     ClydeSentry, LJK/Security, Secure Pak, and The Security Toolkit,
          for assessing and monitoring security in DEC environments.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Exhibition -- A wide range of computer security products will be
displayed during this two-day show.

* Workshop Orientation -- 42 half-day sessions

* Discounts:  40% air travel discounts with United
             35-40% discount on Hyatt Regency O'Hare room rates

Subject:      (Mac) nVIR by Association

The nVIR virus must be executed in SOME way for it to infect a system.
Inserting a disk causes SYSTEM code to be executed, but none from the
inserted disk. I suggest you track this person down, and have him/her
do it again, with you watching. See if there are any funky INITs or
suchlike that s/he's using.

Chances are you have nVIR, Type B, and someone who has a cute sense of
humor has simply renamed the resource ID.  If you can afford to spend
about $70, go out to a retail store and purchase a copy of "Virex" by
HJC Software.  It should alleviate the problem.

Hope this helps!

Subject: I need help with viruses (Mac)

I am a lowly student employee of the Center for Academic Computing at
Penn State University, and I need help in convincing my bosses that it
is NOT necessary to add any other search strings to Virus Detective
2.1.1.  Everyone here seems convinced that search strings like DATA ID
- -4001 and atpl ID 128, both of which are redundant to CODE JStart 7026
for our purposes-all we are trying to do is find the viruses anywhere
on the system disk so that we know to recopy the disk.

If you have any information which would help me convince my bosses of
this, please send it to me!  Thanks!

I'm no MAC expert but I don't even think low level routines are necessary.
ie,
  if file locked then
      unlock file
      infect/change file
      lock file
  else
      infect/change file

Looks like the same strain of nVIR that we have seen a couple of times
at ETH Zurich. Unlike the regular vNIR, this strain does not maintain
an nVIR 2 resource but hides that information somewhere else, causing
all disinfection programs to fail. The only way to get rid of this
nVIR strain is to reload all infected applications from clean copies.

Reprinted without permission from _The Office: Magazine of Information
Systems and Management_, March 1988. I have omitted about 50% of the
paper (that was not false and/or misleading):

The introduction, and the accompanying cartoon, are a rip-off of the
Time magazine article.

A meaningless use of buzzwords.

That is, the same virus infects PCs, minis and mainframes?

That's not what I mean by a Trojan horse...

I don't think I have to comment on this...

I don't know where the number came from. The story differs
significantly from what has been reported by others.

No comment.

>
>An infected computer can be costly. According to the Computer Virus

Somebody ought to do something about this CVIA. As far as I know, 6000
was a very rough estimate. All these exact numbers look very
suspicious.

>...
>
>The past five months have seen heavy interest in anti-viral products.
>After last year's highly-publicized incident, manufacturers of these
>programs experiences as much as a 50% sales increase.
>
>Some 30 products are available, ranging from detective programs which

That's unfortunate, since most of them are worthless/harmful.

>Some programs require users to boot-up once in the morning, others
>require this more frequently. ``The more checking you do, the more

>
>According to Mr. DeMartin, programs used the most often should be

Again, meaningless use of buzzwords.

Meaningless buzzwords; apparently, this refers to networks rather than
PCs.

I am not aware of any reliable statistics comparing the number of
virus infections via shrink-wrapped software with that via software
downloaded from bulletin boards. My personal estimate is that a
shrink-wrapped disk, especially one from a large, badly managed
company, is approximately 3 times as likely to be infected with a
virus than a program picked at random from a reputable BBS.
