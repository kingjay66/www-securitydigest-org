Subject:      Re: Info on How To Book

I know a german book called "Das Grosse Computervirenbuch" by a guy
called Ralf Burger and published in germany by Data Becker.  The people
responsible for bringing the Data Becker things to America are Abacus
Software. I don't have the address handy but can send it to you if you
want. I just got to look for it....

[Ed. Thanks for the info.  I trust that the version in America has
been translated?  I suppose that it's arguably a good idea to send
information like this over the nets, but I feel that once a book like
this has been published, any damage is already done.  I think that it
is certainly worth _our_ while to read books/publications/etc. like
this for our own protection, if nothing else.  Suggestions?]

Subject:      Dormant Viruses (Mac & general)

The Scores/nVIR/Hpat/INIT 29 viruses can all be found, whether or not
there is dormancy code in them, because the resources which define the
viruses are detectable.

This is what's so bad about the new ANTI virus; that sucker just
munges itself into your code -- no detectable resources, no virus
(from the current detectors).

Subject:      Virus susceptability (Mac)

     Just by reading through this discussion, I see that the Apple Mac
seems to be struck more by viruses than any other computer. Is this
true, or do we just have a lot of Mac users here? Also, what makes the
Mac environment so succeptable to these viruses?

Subject:      Re: CTRL-ALT-INS rebooting (PC)

Brent Ingerman responds to a question about *physically* preventing
the computer to boot from the A drive.  Zenith PC's have a 'setup'
screen which is accessed via CTRL-ALT-INS.  One of the options is to
specify the drive from which to boot.

Problems: 1. Any user having knowledge of the 'setup' screen could reset
             the boot drive to A.

          2. Any user NOT having knowledge of the 'setup' screen could
             (and most likely would) find it 'by accident' when s/he,
             intending to press CTRL-ALT-DEL, presses CTRL-ALT-INS.

          3. This fix is software-based.  So here we return to the
             system-specific virus controversy, which I will not rehash here.

I do not have the technical expertise to answer the *original*
question of a *hardware* modification which would prevent booting from
drive A.

Any ideas?

Subject:    Virus Technical Report

       -------------------------------------------------------------
       A review of the threat posed to the security and integrity of
       microcomputer systems posed by self-replicating code segments
       -------------------------------------------------------------

I am in the process of compiling information on existing computer
viruses, with a view to the production of a technical paper reviewing
the threat to system security posed by both present computer viruses
and likely future developments.

To this end I would be very grateful for information on individual
infections, preferably detailing the symptoms observed, damage caused
and disinfection techniques applied. Naturally I am also interested in
details of the operation of the viruses, although I appreciate the
reticence shown by infected parties to disseminate any details of
virus operation, on the basis that it could lead to development of
further viruses.

The technical report is part of a Doctoral research thesis in computer
security, and will be available in late May. Distribution of the
technical report will be restricted to people who have a legitimate
interest (ie systems managers, commercial concerns, research), as I
expect to review the techniques exploited by viruses in a fair degree
of detail at the BIOS/DOS interface level. The report will consider
the techniques used by virus to duplicate, the ways in which viruses
gain control of the computer system, the camouflage techniques adopted
and a brief overview of the existing computer viruses. Finally the
report will consider the likely development of the threat from
viruses, and how this developing threat can be addressed by protective
software in both virtual and non-virtual machine operating
environments.

At the moment I know of the following viruses:

IBM PC MS/DOS
1. Lehigh variant 1 and 2              2. New Zealand (stoned)
3. Vienna (Austrian, 648)              4. Blackjack (1701, 1704)
5. Italian (Ping Pong)                 6. Israeli variant 1 (Friday 13th, 1813,
                                          PLO, Jerusalem), variant 2, variant 3
                                          (April 1st), variant 4
7. Brain (Pakastani) and variants      8. Yale

Also potentially variant of the Rush Hour and VirDem viruses developed
during the CCC's work on viruses.

APPLE MAC
1. NVir variant A and B, Hpat           2. Scores
3. INIT 29                              4. ANTI
5. Peace (MacMag)

APPLE II
1. Elk

AMIGA
1. SCA                                  2. Byte Bandit
3. IRQ

ATARI ST
1. Boot sector                          2. Virus construction set viruses

Mainframe OS worms
1. Internet worm                        2. DECNET worm
2. BITNET Xmas chain letter

I would be grateful for any information on these, or any other
viruses.  Reports of infection may be given in confidence, in which
case they will only be used as an indication of geographical
distribution of infection.

A summary of known viruses, their symptoms, geographic distribution
and known disinfection measures will be posted to the list as soon as
sufficient information is available to prepare an interim report.

As part of the paper I will also be reviewing the effectiveness of
viral disinfection software, and would thus be interested in details
of any software you use, its effectiveness, and availability.

Thanks for your time!

I apologise for any researchers whose articles I have not cited, in
what is currently an incomplete list of references. Hopefully, this
article will be of some use in providing a general list of viruses
which have affected computer systems in the past.

Thanks for your time, and I look forward to any information you can
supply me with.
