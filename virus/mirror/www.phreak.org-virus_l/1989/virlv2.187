VIRUS-L Digest   Thursday,  7 Sep 1989    Volume 2 : Issue 187

VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

I have not attempted to infect any files with a virus, whether on an
AppleShare volume or otherwise, but based on what I know about
Macintosh, AppleShare and viruses, here is what I think is true.

A Mac virus can infect a file only if it can write to the file, no matter
where the file is located. A micro cannot access an AppleShare volume
directly: it must ask the server to access the AppleShare volume on its
behalf.  As a result, the server can enforce access privileges.

Access privileges apply only to FOLDERS. For the benefit of other
readers, the privileges are See Files, See folders and Make Changes.
They apply individually to the owner, a group, and everyone.

I experimented writing directly to files and folders on an AppleShare
volume using Microsoft Word, typing the explicit file path in a
Save As... dialog box.  For a file to be changeable, the volume and
folders in the file path must have See Folders privilege, and the final
folder must have See Files and Make Changes privilege. The virus would
probably need to search for files to infect, and would only find files
along paths with See Folders privs for the volume and folders in the
path, and See Files in the final folder.

Macintoshes used with shared files are subject to trojans, and the trojan
could be infected with a virus.  Consider the following scenario: A user
has a private folder on a volume shared with others using (say)
AppleShare. The volume has a folder containing a shared application
named, say, Prog1, and the folder has everyone See Files and
See Folders but not Make Changes (i.e. it is read-only). The user makes
a private copy of Prog1, and later runs a virus-infected program locally
while the shared volume is mounted, and the copy of Prog1 becomes
infected. The user now makes his AppleShare folder sharable (See Files,
See Folders) to everyone (so that someone can copy a file he has,
say). Another user double-clicks on a document created by Prog1,
and the Mac Finder happens to find the infected copy of Prog1 before
finding the other copy. As a result, the second user's files become
infected.

Thus I recommend that private folders be readable only by the owner as a
matter of policy.  Allowing everyone Make Changes creates drop folders
so that users can exchange files. Drop Folders are safe enough in that
AppleShare does not allow you to overwrite a file when you only have
Make Changes priv. However, users should be told to run a virus check
on any files that others drop in their folders.

Subject: Aborting a write to a write-protected disk (PC)

   Several respondants to the "Abort, Retry, Ignore" message have
suggested using Abort.  I disagree strongly: if you do that, usually
you get kicked out to DOS, so e.g. all your current session editing
changes are lost.

   What should be done is to remove the write-protection, and retry.  If
there's not enough space, most programs will take control and allow
a graceful exit. If it fits, but you want it on another disk, so what?
Just save again.  DONT Abort unless you don't care about the current
changes.

[Ed. This is probably a better topic for a group like comp.sys.ibmpc
since it isn't directly virus related.  Nonetheless, it's a fairly
fitting end to this subject (right?).]

Subject: Rumored October 12/13 virus attacks

About the OCT 12/13 rumored virus attack...an article in the
Aug 28th issue of Federal Computer Week reports  "Sobczak said
candidates for the intrusion so far include the following viruses:
   DATACRIME, a virus that wipes out data by modifying .COM files,
alleged to be planed for execution Oct 12 or 13.
   A West German virus, apparently discussed at a hacker's convention
in Amsterdam earlier this month, to be introduced through BITNET.
   An enhanced version of an earlier Icelandic virus rewritten to avoid
detection by constantly changing its location in memory."

[Ed. I saw that too (thanks for the FAX, Bruce!) - does anyone have
any info about this alleged Icelandic variant?]

Subject: Can a PC Virus get into VMS via VAXPC?

We have this PC emulation VAXPC V1.0 running under VMS V5.1-1 with
DECwindows.  Is it possible that PC viruses have the same or at least
a similar effect on this emulation i.e. deleting/altering files stored
on the virtual disk? Or are there any known viruses that jump out of
the emulation and affect files under VMS? Sounds stupid but ifever
anyone out there in netland has made bad experiences let me know.
