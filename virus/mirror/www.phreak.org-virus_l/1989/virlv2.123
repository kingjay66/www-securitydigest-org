Ahem, WRONG!
 
Hi, considr you have a harddisk machine ohhh say a Mac II and you put
a new (from the company) disk ooohhh say Aldus Freehand in the drive.
Now, on your hard disk, you have all the programs that you BOUGHT
(yes, the "B" word!).  You install your copy of Freehand on the
harddisk BUT it has SCORES ON IT!  Do you still think that Virus
writing is not a crime?
    This actually happened to us at Southeastern U..  Luckily, we have
people here who have a clue and we fixed it.  Defining the term
`Virus' and criminal actions is not easy.  Technically, a virial
program that would search out and destroy resident copies of scores or
nVir or etc is a virus and the distinction is only in the intent of
the programmer and the result of his and many in between (those who
swap disks).  In short, (and as of now) a criminal virus is one that
is capable of destroying/altering information and is resident in a
`parasite' state.  This does not include programs that search out and
destroy the above as their purpose is to remove the danger not to
cause it.  Remember this is not a comprehensive defination.
 
                                good discussions, let's kep it up and
                                make something of it.

I hereby declare June "Stop Using Interferon and Use Disinfectant,
Please" Month. TOPS uses a non-standard, unusual, but NOT illegal or
viral, segmentation scheme. CODE 0 immediately jumps to another
segment, which Interferon labels as a "sneak" (BTW: there is no such
virus; it's just a made-up term).
 
Interferon's check is too weak; it catches OK programs (like TOPS) and
causes unnecessary heartburn and agonization. Disinfectant does not do
this. It was an attempt to make a "predictive" detector which would
alert you if it found something that looks like a virus.
 
If you must have a predictive checker, try Steve Brecher's Repair
program (available via anonymous FTP from sumex-aim.stanford.edu as
/info-mac/virus/repair.hqx). It is supposedly able to detect clones of
the nVIR virus and stomp them. It won't find anything else weird,
though.

Interferon has a tendency to report "sneak" infections in some cases in
which it should not.  I believe that recent versions of TOPS trigger
this alert.
 
I suggest that you download a copy of Disinfectant from the archives at
SUMEX-AIM.Stanford.Edu and use it to scan your system.  It is much less
prone to false alarms, and will detect viruses that Interferon will
miss.

TOPS and a number of other useful INITs (e.g. the Moire screen-saver,
the RAM Disk CDEV, etc.) tend to modify themselves.  Open the Gatekeeper
Control Panel window, flip the switch to "Settings", add these files to
the applications/inits list (or select them, if they're already there)
and then grant them "Res: self" permission.  This will prevent the
alerts from occurring when these INITs twiddle with their own resources,
but it will prevent them from infecting other files if they are indeed
virus-ridden.

Yup.  I don't believe so.

You're welcome!

Subject: Atari ST boot sector virus wasn't a new strain...
 
A couple of weeks ago I reported an ST boot virus to digest readers.
At that point the virus had just been discoverd and I knew very little
about it.  I sent a copy of the virus to George Woodside, author of
the public domain VKILLER, in hopes that he could identify it.  He
could.  The virus I had was the "mouse inversion" virus.  It copies
itself to the bootsector of disk, keeping a counter of it's
activities.  When the counter reaches five it inverts the vertical
movements of your mouse.  When it reaches five again it puts
everything back to normal.  This cycle just keeps repeating.  No
damage is done other than stomping on various boot sectors.
Woodside's latest version of Vkiller (2.20 May 1989) *will* recognize
this virus.  The version I had (2.01) would not. As far I know VKILLER
2.20 is not yet available on CIS or GEnie.
 
A couple things to note: When VKILLER 2.20 recognizes this virus it
says that it (the virus) checks for executable boot sectors and
doesn't write over any that it finds.  My experience does *not*
confirm this as the *#&$ thing stomped on an executable boot sector of
mine!  Woodside's FLU.PRG, a virus simulator, is a handy thing to
have.  I know it's available via FTP from one of the Atari archives. I
can't FTP from NIU so I don't know much more.  FLU.PRG demonstrates,
in a non-harmful manner, what the known 15 ST viruses do. Not only
does it help in identifying them, but it helps to satisfy ones morbid
curiousity about such things w/out having to actually get an infected
disk.
 
In summary: I was infected by a known virus.  It wasn't "new", as
I thought it might be, it's just that the version of VKILLER I was
running couldn't identify it.
- -=->G<-=-
 
PS: Please don't ask me to uuencode the file and send it to you.  Such
things don't work at this site.  If I get information on when/where
the newest version of VKILLER is available I'll post a short note
here.

Hi,
 
     This might sound a bit unusual but I'd like to get a copy of
Virus-Maker.  My department is in charge of a computer lab where our
user community can test and evaluate a wide variety of HW/SW systems.
We are also supposed to be the 'source' of PC knowledge.  Recently we
were caught off guard by the BRAIN virus and we had to scramble to
recover the data of a few distressed users.  What I'd like to be able
to do is at my leisure use a 'guinea pig' PC for testing purposes.  If
we can see how some of these darn things work, then we'll know better
how to counter them.  We currently have c-4 and flushot3 in addition
to the regular Norton /PCtools programs to help us.
     BTW, the ROM check option on Flushot3 managed to crash our Compaq
Deskpro-286 when I tested it with PCtools doing low level disk access.
I had to reboot with the configuration disk and reinit the PROM.
     Also I got CHEKUP18 from SCFVM and it hung both the Compaq and the XT.
Any thoughts on these glitches?

[Ed. I'd suggest starting with new versions of the programs that
you're using - get FluShot+ 1.52.]
