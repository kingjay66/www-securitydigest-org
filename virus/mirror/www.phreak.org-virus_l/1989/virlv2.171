Those interested in discussing and/or reading about the Internet Worm
(of last November) may want to take a look at some of the current
discussions on the Usenet newsgroup, comp.protocols.tcp-ip.

Subject: Looking for anti-viral archive sites
 
In conjunction with comp.virus/VIRUS-L, we have been trying to establish
a number of archive sites throughout the world to distribute anti-viral
information and software.  The microcomputer sites are well established,
and now we'd like to expand our focus.  To this end, I'm asking for one or
more sites to volunteer their support of the archive system.
 
What we are particularly looking for is a site to hold information of
interest to the computers hooked up to these various networks.  Most
likely this will be focused on Unix support, but other systems (VMS, MVS,
etc.) are also welcome.  What interests you?
 
The contents of the archives will be determined by what is contributed.
Research papers, warnings of potential problems, bug fixes, monitoring
software, etc. etc.  The archives will hopefully reflect the community's
needs.
 
If you already maintain such an archive, please let me know so I can add
you to our list of sites.  If you'd like more information, write to me
or post a message to the list.  All follow-ups have been directed to
comp.virus.
 
Thanks for your consideration.

Subject: Memory Resident ViruScan (PC)
 
The following is a forward from John McAfee:
==============================================================================
 
    I've had a number of requests for a version of VIRUSCAN which will
stay resident and check each program as it's loaded.  The suggestions
were that such a program would give no false alarms and would not
interfere with other memory resident programs since it would not need
to check interrupt 13 or other disk I/O calls.
    I succumbed to temptation and made a memory resident version.
Initial testing has gone well and it indeed does not conflict with any
other memory resident program and we have not seen sny false alarms
from a variety of systems.  When it loads it checks the partition
table, boot sector, hidden files and the Command Interpreter.
Thereafter it scan each program that's loaded.  That's it.  What I
need now are beta testers.  Everyone who insisted that I build this
thing has a moral obligation to step up to the line and volunteer.
Please call me at 408 727 4559, 408 988 3832, or leave a message on
HomeBase at 408 988 4004.
    Thanking you in advance.   John McAfee

# Introduction to the Anti-viral archives...
# Listing of 08 August 1989
 
This posting is the introduction to the "official" anti-viral archives
of virus-l/comp.virus.  With the generous cooperation of many sites
throughout the world, we are attempting to make available to all
the most recent news and programs for dealing with the virus problem.
Currently we have sites for Amiga, Apple II, Atari ST, IBMPC and
Macintosh microcomputers, as well as sites carrying research papers
and reports of general interest.  Still looking for sites for larger
systems.
 
If you have general questions regarding the archives, you can send
them to this list or to me.  I'll do my best to help.  If you have
an archive site and would like to volunteer your site (and are in
a position to do so! :-), send me a message.  Also, if you have a
submission for the archives, you can send it to me or to one of the
persons in charge of the relevant sites.
 
If you have any corrections to the lists, please let me know.

Dear Joe:
 
I don't know if this is at all possible, but is there some way I can
be included in an AFD (Automatic File Distribution ??) for Disinfectant?
I am not directly on the internet, but can be reached by UUCP.
 
My apologies if thru ignorance I have asked for something that is
inappropriate.
 
My many thanks if there is some way to honor my request.  I would be
quite pleased to receive other Virus Remedies thru mail as well.
 
thanks, again.
