VIRUS-L Digest   Tuesday, 26 Sep 1989    Volume 2 : Issue 203

VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: WARNING NoteWriter Software Infected!

A few words of warning for potential and actual NoteWriter users.

We bought two copies of NoteWriter Software and both disks were infected with
Scores and nVir.  Attempting to install the (copyprotected) software on a Mac
II running Vaccine failed, and rendered the original unusable. The backup disk
which we ordered was also infected.

The publisher has been very unhelpful.  Their tech support doesn't know
anything about viruses, virus protection programs (like Vaccine) or most of
what else we tried to ask them.

Subject: 123 virus (PC)

for lack of a better name and until/if someone objects with a
legitimate reason, i feel the name for the virus targeted
at release 3 of lotus 123 should be called 123nhalf since it
causes your spreadsheet to be saved exactly one half the size
it should be.

in any event, an update is in order. we have now discovered that
this virus will only, repeat only infect the 123dos.exe file,
when running on a machine with a '286 processor. it will not
infect the file on a '386 system. we are attempting to determine
the exact reason for this strange coincidence. it is felt at the
current time that the way a '386 creates virtual machines may
have something to do with it.

the virus also will not infect files unless there is a minimum
of 3 megabytes of extended memory. expanded memory does not matter
and does not come into the picture.

a scan program is now available which quickly checks the 123dos file
in three different locations to determine if the virus is present.
a copy is on the way to mr. mcafee of mcafee associates for his
observations.

hopefully mr. mcafee will post it on homebase so the rest of the
readers can benefit from this program. the name of the scan program
is 123scan.exe and it should be at mcafee associates bythe end of
this week.

we have no way of uploading to the mainframe here, so i cannot
convert it to a .uue file for transit through the nets. however
the program is shareware and will soon be available.

for those of you who are not familiar with this virus, it infects
the large file named 123dos.exe which is now used in release 3
of lotus 123. there is only one symptom, but that is all this one
needs.

if your copy of 123dos.exe is infected, no matter what size
spreadsheet you create and save, it will only be saved as one
half the size.

in other words, a 100 x 100 cell spreadsheet will only be saved
as a 50 x 50 cell spreadsheet. as you can imagine this can be
quite a problem.

well, that's it for now!

Subject: More Datacrime hoopla, propoganda, and general paranoia.

I've just spent the past three hours reading and re-reading various
forms of hype about the alleged upcoming attack on October 13 of the
Datacrime virus.  I would like to make a couple comments about this.

First and foremost, there is no doubt in my mind (nor has there ever
been any doubt in my mind), that Datacrime is a real virus, causes
real problems, and will next strike on October 13 (it is, after-all, a
"time-bomb" virus, that activates on specific dates, in this case,
Friday the 13ths).

I have real doubts however that this virus has made any inroads into
the United States beyond the 10 cases John McAfee has cited
previously.

I suppose it is a good thing that the NoCrime application has been
updated to detect a new strain of DataCrime, and that all sorts of
other PC-based applications have been updated to detect DataCrime, (as
an aside, the people who make "Quarantine" for the MS-DOS called me
today to let me know they are sending me a demo copy of their
application to beat on, and they made a point to let me know it
detects DataCrime!), *however*, all of this does not an epidemic make!

Sure people are updating their applications to fight Datacrime;
Datacrime is a known virus that uses established infection techniques!
It's not that hard (I would imagine) to make the changes to the
applications to fight Datacrime.

When it all comes down to it, if the desktop computers of the United
States were under attack right now by Datacrime (or any of dozens of
other viruses), we would be seeing signs of it, and Virus-L would be
full of reports of infections.  No infections, no virus.

Now can everyone please calm down?  The sky is not falling.

Subject: re: should we fight fire with fire

i do not think a new anti-virus is the answer. i think software
manufacturers have to take the initiative in the virus war.

for instance, the 123scan.exe program which detects the 123nhalf
virus, uses the new selftest (tm) module to detect any changes
made to the program file after it was compiled.

selftest (tm) is not perfect, but what is these days? in any
event in three months of testing, a program protected by selftest (tm)
has never failed to indicate that a change has been made.

selftest (tm) was written by and for shareware authors. it adds just
a few seconds to the load time of a program, and detects a change in
file length, or bit level changes made to the file.

i think it is time that the manufacturers who have raked in the money
for years get more involved in the fight against viruses.

Subject: A book with a long title...

John McAfee has just published a book on viruses entitled: "Computer
Viruses, Worms, Data Diddlers, Killer Programs, and other Threats To
Your System: What The Are, How They Work, and How to Defend Your PC or
Mainframe Environment" (By McAfee and Colin Hayes, from St. Martin
Press -- $24.95 hardback, $16.95 softback).

My questions about the propriety of calling Viruscan "shareware"
aside, I've had a copy of the book set aside and I'm picking it up
tonight.  John's work in this area is well-known, and I anxiously look
forward to reading this (but at 350 pp, don't count on hearing any
comments from me soon about it!)

And would someone from Homebase *please* ask John to make the title of
his next book shorter!  <Grin>

in a recent message to this list from david gursky, he made a
statement which needs to be corrected. he made the statement

"if the author of a package wants to limit the sources from which
his or her work is available, fine! but by doing so you forfeit
the right to label,your work as shareware!"

this is not so. shareware is for the most part copyrighted and
mr. mcafee's software does indeed carry a copyright! as the owner
of a work which is copyrighted, j. mcafee caN CALL IT SHAREWARE
OR ANY OTHER NAME HE DESIRES, EVEN FREEWARE, AND STILL MAINTAIN
THE ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO DETERMINE WHO MAY OR MAY NOT DISTRIBUTE
HIS COPYRIGHTED WORK!

A copyrighted work is the sole property of the holder of the
copyright.like it or not, that is the law of the land. until
such time a case comes to court, copyrighted shareware remains
the property of the copyright holder, who may decide who has the
right to distribute such work.

the opinions expressed here are my own.

In a recent posting CZMUREK%DREW.BITNET@VMA.CC.CMU.EDU writes ...

% I began to design a virus algorythm that would eventually serve
% as the platform for the destruction of other viruses.  It's purpose
% would be to infect single programs, single disks, or multiple disks in
% the first, second and third versions respectively.  Before any alarm
% sets in here about my intentions, I would like to say that the purpose
% here is to aid in the effort to combat these little nasties.

I thought many of you might be interested to know that at least one such
"utility" has been written and distributed for the Amiga. The one I have
heard of is called "System-Z" , which is composed of two parts , namely
the System-Z "installer" and the Sys-Z "bootblock".

When an Amiga is booted up from a disk containing the Sys-Z bootblock,
it announces to the user that it is now present in memory ( until the
machine in question is de-powered ) by way of a quick rainbow screen
and a short series of musical notes. This program will identify a
variety of Amiga specific viruses located in other disk's bootblocks,
and allow the user the option of overwriting the bootblock of the
infected disk with the Sys-Z bootblock. Apparently it does NOT write
itself indiscriminately to other disk's bootblocks, but only when the
user selects to do so.

Many Amiga users do not consider this to be a virus , but many others
do. In fact , at least one Virus Checker / Disinfectant / Obliterator
I know of considers it to be a virus , and identifies it as such. The
reason many do consider it a virus is the fact that it locates itself
in the bootblock. I believe that this "utility" hails from Europe ,
and might even of been of a commercial nature.

Perhaps someone else out there has more info on this creature. I have
never actually seen it in action , only seen documentation on it in
forums like this and in one Virus Killer's documentation.

Subject: anti-virus software accessibility

some universities have no pratical way of allowing students or
faculty to download software acquired over the network. this
can be a problem for many reasons.

i know that homebase exists, however to call there once a week or
so to obtain the latest copies of the viral software packages can
get to be expensive.

does anyone know of any reliable bbs in the new york area which
maintains copies of the latest viruscan, etc; programs?

if not, i would be willing to make copies and distribute them to
anyone who sends a disk and return postage. of course, this is
only if mr. mcafee would give his permission, and if i can get
clean copies to begin with.
