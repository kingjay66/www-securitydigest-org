Hello,
   My name is Ed and I work for Rutgers University (NJ).  We have been
hit with a few different Mac viruses in the past and have become
unfortunately well acquainted with them.  In fact, a very significant
number of students who own disks still have viruses on them.  One
virus we have come across is nVIR.  A few different "strains" have
actually appeared.  The best known remedy for this virus that I have
found is ANTI-PAN.  There are also remedies for the scores virus
(which we were also hit with).  But is there a remedy for the ANTI
virus?  We haven't been hit with it, but it might be safer to be
prepared.  Thanks.  Ed,
                                  IN%"EROSKOS@ZODIAC.BITNET"

Subject: Dealing with nVIR on a large scale (Mac)

Here at Penn State there are some general guidelines we use to avoid
massive infestations of viruses.  These rules were adopted after a
major epidemic of both nVIR and Scores last semester.

First, all of the software available for student use is kept on remote
servers (AppleShare), which the individual machines (Mac SE's) link to
via AppleTalk.  The servers are READ-ONLY, to prevent the applications
from becoming infected through the network.

Second, the lab operators check each network startup disk for viruses
when it is returned (this is done with Virus Detective).  If a disk is
infected, it is recopied from a permanently locked master disk.  This
recopying is done with Copy II Mac, and is a complete rewrite of the
disk.  This may not be totally necessary, but is a fairly fast and
absolutely secure method of restoring a damaged startup disk.

Note that no attempt is made to "repair" damaged startup disks.  It is
much easier and faster to simply recopy them.  If, however, a user
turns in an infected startup disk, then the operator can offer to
check the user's own disks for viruses.  Often the user's disks are
also infected.  In this case, the operator (or one of the operator's
friends who is familiar with the correct procedures) can use programs
such as KillScores, Ferret, Vaccination, etc. to "disinfect" the
user's disks.

This procedure works fairly well, but once a virus appears on campus
it will probably remain a lingering problem.  The only to keep the
incidence of infection down is to be diligent in checking the
public-use disks EVERY TIME THEY ARE USED.  If two operators working
two consecutive shifts here neglect to check for viruses, the
percentage of network startup disks that are infected more than
doubles.

Subject:  Disk Washing -- or -- Sanitation in our Public Microlab (Mac)

We have a Microcomputer Lab which is used for "open-access" when it is
not reserved for classes.  Last November we discovered that it was a
sink of infection for the Scores virus.  The situation was
particularly serious because we were recommending that everyone use
our "MicroLab Laser Startup" disks so that everyone on the AppleTalk
network had the same LaserWriter driver (avoiding many restarts of the
LW).  People routinely used their applications with our systems, so
infection could readily spread from their app disk to our system disk,
then from our system to the next user's app disk, and so on.

As a result, we have now adopted what I call "disk washing" as a
policy and procedure.  We have clean backups for each disk which we
hand out to users.  When we get the disk back from the user, we "wash"
it by doing a sector copy from the backup.  No disk is recirculated
until it has been washed.  (Same rule as in a restaurant, *mutatis
mutandis*). In practice, we have a "dirty disks" box in which disks
pile up until a slack time, when the monitor goes through and recopies
from backups).

So far, we have not seen any re-infection (we check regularly).  I am
not qualified to way that there could NEVER be a virus which could
defeat this disk-washing approach, but no Mac virus yet described in
the literature (VIRUS-L) can do it.

I don't know how this would apply to AppleShare volumes.  I also don't
know how one would manage hard-disk equipped public micros.  I am
recommending that, when we ourgrow diskettes, we use removable hard
disks (Syquest), "big" floppies (Jasmine), or some other technology
which will permit "washing" between uses.

Subject: Public Mac facilities at Cornell

The public Macintosh facilities at Cornell have antivirus procedures
that seem to be working fine here.  Each of the several facilities has
one Mac set aside for users to check their disks for viruses.  These
Macs are equipped with a software-locked hard disk on which resides
Vaccine, Interferon, and various other programs for finding and
removing viruses.  Many of the users are using these machines to check
their disks... some don't take the time, but that's to be expected.

Also, since our public facilities have copies of various software
products on disk to lend out, these disks must be handled very
carefully.  The policy that was implemented a couple of months ago is
that ALL of these disks, when they are returned to the facility's
operator, are initialized, and restored from locked originals.  This
entirely eliminates the possibility that users are infecting the
public disks (but it assumes, of course, that the originals are not
infected...  this is, obviously, very important!).

All of the facilities have signs up that tell users to turn off the
machines when they're done.  The signs also say that, if a machine is
found still on, it should be turned off and back on before it's used.

These measures seem to have done a good job of slowing the spread of
viruses at Cornell, which HAS been hit by several viruses.  I'd be
interested to hear some descriptions of the measures being taken at
public facilities at the institutions of our other subscribers.

RE Eric Davies statement that Interferon 3.0 chokes on AppleShare
volumes, I wonder if it only has problems when running against the
volume from an AppleShare client.  If the AppleShare server is a Mac,
he should be able to take down the server and run it on the server
directly as a standalone micro.
