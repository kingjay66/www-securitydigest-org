     I hate to tell you guys, but the info provided in most newspapers
after that nasty ARPA worm hit was enough for me and the consultants
here to go on if we happened to write another one. Don't complain
about these books when Magazines have been supplying this info for
years. I read the Articles in Science Digest and said "Hey, I could do
that." Not that I ever did, but the concepts are fairly easy, at least
for worms and trojans. Any good programmer could whip up something
like the Bitnet XMAS greeting in thirty minutes. But not too many
would because we are not all wierdoes who enjoy that sort of thing.
This book won't really make much difference in what's out there. There
won't be many new viruses, but maybe more old ones, if listings are
provided in the book. Thought you'd like to know...

     Recently we've gotten a copy of Interferon 3.0 for our Mac's here
at Xavier to eradicate the nVIR virus that infected our hard disks.
Occasionally, when a disk is checked, the message, "This is not an HPS
disk" appears.  Does anyone know what this means?

Thanks,

In 2.40, David J. Ferbrache mentions an Apple // virus (elk).  This is
the first time I've seen reference to this critter - any info out
there other than it's name??

it is a hoax (like the "modem  virus"), but it is too scary to ignore.
