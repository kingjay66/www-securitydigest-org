Subject:  Info on virus reported in Comm. of the ACM?

        Does anyone know anymore information about the virus reported
in the February 1989 volume 32 number 2 page 274 issue of the
Communications of the ACM?  According to the article:

        "A hardware-induced computer virus could potentially affect 25
million microcomputers, according to a recent discovery by researchers
at NOVA University and ErrorNot Corporation.  The researchers say the
viruse is the result of faulty programming in the microcode of a
device used in computers.  Research indicates this viruse causes data
corruption, and its random pattern of attack with small data
destruction makes is difficult to identify.  The virus's dormancy
period varies from weeks or months to even years."

        The article then proceeds to give an address at NOVA where you
can send five dollars and receive a report of their findings
(TR-881101-1).  Does anyone know anything about this?  It is news to
me and the article offers no insight.

Hallo,
        in the readnews comp.os.vms I read that there exists a group
especially on the subject of Virus. Is it possible to get more
information of this group? Could I get into this group in order to get
the informations passed around as well?
        I am a system manager myself. Therefore I'm interested in news
on Viruses.
        Thanks in advance.
Bye

Subject: Request for info about Atari viruses.

Hello,
   Could someone please send me information concerning viruses on the
Atari ST computers.  I just started using PD software so I would like
to have knowlegde of possible infections to my system.

Subject: Appleshare Network Security

I manage a Macintosh network running AppleShare 2.0 FileServer and
PrintServer.  Users on the network have the option of downloading
server software or using their own.  All printing jobs, regardless of
software, are spooled to the server.

I am the only person enabled to write to the server.  Yesterday, while
doing backups, I noticed three new document files in the system
folder:
                                      (creator)  (type)
               0Aldus1.2Prep    36k     asps      lspt
               0Aldus1.2PrepS    6k     asps      lspt
               0Aldus1.2Prep     0k     asps      lsqt

The files were in a new print queue folder called Q_0aserWriter II_*
together with the usual queue and log files for the LaserWriter.  They
appear to have been created by the server software, but how and why is
a mystery to me.

PageMaker is not a program on the server.  Someone obviously has used
an outdated (and probably pirated) copy to do some printing.  I called
Aldus to find out how a their prep file and dictionary could be copied
to a write-protected server.  They had no idea.  Since there is now a
virus (INIT 29) that attaches itself to documents, I am understandably
nervous about unknown files lying around on the server.  If anyone
knows how these files are created and, most important, how I can keep
them off, please let me know.  Many thanks.

Subject: Another Anonymous FTP host for VIRUS-L archives

Thanks to Vijay Subramaniam, we now have another anonymous FTP host
for the VIRUS-L archives, lll-winken.llnl.gov.  The difference between
that site and ibm1.cc.lehigh.edu is that lll-winken.llnl.gov is a UNIX
based machine that is connected to the NSFNET backbone, thus providing
fast reliable FTP service to Internet users.  Also, binary files will
be stored there as binary files, not in uuencoded format, and the
VIRUS-L digests will be stored individually (by number), not in weekly
logs.  Finally, all the files will be stored hierarchically in
subdirectories.  The directories are as follows:

virus-l - base directory for VIRUS-L related files
virus-l/archives - base directory for archive files
virus-l/archives/1988
virus-l/archives/1989
...                   - each subdir contains digests for that year.
virus-l/src - base directory for programs
virus-l/src/pc
virus-l/src/mac
virus-l/src/misc
...                   - each subdir contains programs for indicated machine.
virus-l/docs - directory for virus related documents, like the
               Internet Worm reports.

It will take a few days to get all the files there, so please be
patient.  Comments, suggestions, etc., are welcomed.

Ken
