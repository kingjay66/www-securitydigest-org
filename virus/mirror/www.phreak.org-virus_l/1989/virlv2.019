You might check last year's Risks digests. The association was
mentioned there, and not in a very good light.

It seems that the owner of a software company specialized in
virus-detecting tools created this association with the sole purpose
of publicity. He claimed that its members held over 90% of the
computer vaccine market, but was unable to sustain his claim when
asked by a competitor (who was - of course - not member of the
association).

I've heard various reports now on the purported Friday the 13th virus
hitting the UK last week on Friday the 13th.  Now I've been told that
the Philadelphia Inquirer, a reputable newspaper on the East Coast,
had an article on it in their Saturday (the 14th) newspaper.  I didn't
see the article, however.  Does anyone have any more information on
this?  If so, I'm sure that many of us would be interested in hearing
about it.  The reports that I've heard make the virus sound an awful
lot like the Israel virus of the same name.

Hello folks!

  I have a  question concerning a  possible virus I  heard about. It's
running on a PDP (as far  as I know) and  shows the following symptoms
when it has installed itself:

  Sporadically the screen is cleared and the  message "I AM HUNGRY" is
displayed.  The machine then  waits for  input.  In  order  to get the
machine running  again  one has to  enter the word 'COOKIES'.  If done
so, everything   returns to normal,  otherwise  the  machine continues
waiting for input.

  Are  these symptoms known to anyone,  and does a vaccine  against it
exist? Please respond directly to me as I'm not on this list.

/T.H.
