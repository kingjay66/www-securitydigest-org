Here is some information about the Aids disc, gleaned from research
done in London, which, judging from messages taken from the network
and passed on to me from the Edinburgh Virus BB, you may not be aware of.

There are indeed two versions of the disc. There were a few, sent out
about a month ago, labelled as version 1.0. Most of them are labelled
2.0. The two versions are different.

There is a complete fix program available, which will totally un-
scramble you disc even if the trojan has done it's stuff. Not easy
when you consider how the encryption key was made up (i.e. out of free
memory, date, MS-DOS version and so on). If you need this program you
can get hold of it by 'phoning 01-831 9252 (PCBW offices) and ask for
it. PCBW can also be found in the basement of 99 Grey's Inn Road,
London, and would love some more copies of the discs, especially
version 1.0.

The program to restore a smashed disc is called CLEARAIDS and will
soon be available on "cix" in the conference "virus/files". CIX is a
commercial system which us poor non-academics have to use instead of
Janet. <hint!> [OK Frank - I'll get you an ID. GToal]

Thanks for gtoal@uk.ac.ed for getting stuff on and off Janet for this.

From:    Klaus Brunnstein <brunnstein@rz.informatik.uni-hamburg.dbp.de>
Subject: Trojan AIDS: the AIDS program (PC)

The AIDS diskette contains 2 programs,
              INSTALL.EXE   146.188 Bytes   9-28-89     4:28p
              AIDS.   EXE   172.562 Bytes   8-07-89    10:28p

the first of which is described by J.McAfee and others (INSTALL.EXE and it's
installed versions REM,SHARE) in VIRUS-L; this is the Trojan horse.

The AIDS-program itself contains a question/answering session with AIDS-
related question, where a `risk' (on 7 levels) is computed for the specific
answers. While most other groups are analysing the INSTALLed Trojan horse,
one group at Virus Test Center Hamburg actually analyses the AIDS program.

We have run several sessions, and we regard the program as *not very
intelligent* from the Informatics standpoint, and *not highly reliable*
from the medical standpoint (we will prove this with some medical experts; we
received 4 copies from specialists in immunology, and 3 more copies from
banks etc).

The AIDS program works rather linearly; the dialogue is done with simple
multiple choices, where the 1st option is alwys HELP-text. If you analyse the
HELP texts, they are not very specific (many of them may have been generated
from an ordinary lexikon). In section 1, BACKGROUND INFORMATION is gathered,
e.g. residence country, sex, age (in 9 clusters), ancestors origin continent,
sexual behaviour (heterosexual, no sexual experience, homosexual or bisexual),
and number of sex partners since 1980 (in 8 clusters from 0 to 100+)are asked.

In section 2, MEDICAL HISTORY is examined, e.g. how many blood transfusions
since 1980, active tuberculosis, drug injection, sexually transmitted
diseases, sexual habits (use of condom..). For some positive answers,
there may be additional details asked for. No mechanism is visible whcih
safeguards the extensive personal data; on the other side, no data are
gathered which may be used to authenticate a person and relate their name
with the data gathered.

After an evaluation procedure (less than 1 minute on an AT), `you' are
assigned to one of seven Levels of AIDS Risk (`no risk, very low risk,
low risk, medium risk, high risk, very high risk, extremely high risk).
Depending on the list of answers, a PERSONAL ADVICE is given, e.g. stating
`Your risk of exposure to the AIDS virus is low but presently increasing..',
suggesting to use condoms, etc. Finally, you are asked to input YOUR
COMMENTS (`Use the computer like a typewriter. Type anything that comes to
your mind ... The computer will then analyze your remarks and respond to you
with further comments..'). The answers are rather unspecific.

Based on some experiments (with more systematic testing to be done
after having reverse-engineered the code), my best estimation is, that
the question-answering is done in typical BASIC style, and that the
risk evaluation function is only very rudimentary (we received a 'low
risk' for a young female drug addict). The personal advice seems to be
programmed from a few types of answers, and the analysis of Your
Comments fails with even simple, AIDS-related questions.

The 'loose' relation between INSTALL/REM/SHARE and AIDS (probably influencing
the catastrophic counter, evidently initialised at 90 and decremented during
bootup) will very probably allow to use the INSTALL process also *in connection
with other 'interesting programs'*. With so may diskettes distributed, we may
face similar (and maybe more serious) threats. I therefore appreciate
J.McAfee's remark that he has included his ANTI-Trojan in his ANTIVIRUS tool.
Though mixing up an Antivirus Tool with Anti-Trojan functions may produce
new problems (e.g. misunderstanding the respective threats and the limitations
of such tools), I suggest that also other antivirus tools should contain a
diagnostic featrue for Trojan AIDS.

Evaluating the given situation, I conclude that the business procedure (the
e.g. distribution of diskettes) was professional, and that the Trojan horses
mechanisms were rather intelligent, though some parts of the INSTALL/REM/SHARE
are primitively linear programmed, e.g. the `encryption' part. The AIDS
program is of neither good programming nor medical standard.

    Illegal in the United States, which may be why they didn't try to
spread it here.

    According to the regulations of the U.S. Postal Service, if you
receive something through the mail which you have not ordered, then
you automatically own it.

    If this were not enforced, then many of these annoying organizations
that send us ads for junk products would instead be sending us the junk
products, along with a bill for their trash.

    Does the U.K. have a similar law?

In VIRUS-L Digest V2 #265, "Carl_A.Fassbender" <YOOPER@MSU.BITNET> was
asking why the Gatekeeper & Gatekeeper Aid icon did not show up after
he made the files invisible.

The Mac OS does not load INITs that are part of files with the
Invisible bit set.  [Editorial comment: Hey Apple!  Why?????]  If you
want to have Gatekeeper active, you must have the file visible on the

From:    greenber@utoday.UU.NET (Ross M. Greenberg)
Subject: Authentication

Bob Bosen, of Enigma, comments in VL V2#265 further about the need for
X9.9 as the level of sophistication required of an authentication
scheme.

I'm not sure he's right.  Let's look at two different usages for
authentication schemes: one, to determine if a program is what you
expect it to be during a "global" scan, one to determine if the
program is what you expect it to be immediately before it is run.

A subset of the second portion above is whether a program can contain
a self-checker -- a portion that checks itself when it is run.  I
propose that self-checkers, while useful, are meaningless: by the time
a self-checker's checking code is run, the virus or trojan's damage is
already done.  Additionally, what prevents the virus/trojan from
removing itself from the host file and/or memory before the
self-checker runs?  Therefore, self-checking programs are not realy
worthy of further comment.

Case 1, above, when a scanning program checks a file's signature
against a supposed signature is good stuff.  Yet, you must prepare
yourself for a long initial time to build the original authentication
database -- the more complex the scheme, the longer such a check will
take.  There's a commercial anti-virus program out there already that
does some sort of authentication check on every executable on your
disk (PC-based).  On a full disk, it can take something like three
hours to run on an XT machine.  X9.9 might be a good approach, but if
it takes even that longer and not longer, you simply won;t get people
using it -- regardless of how wonderful it is.  If I have to run such
a beast each morning, I'll pass.  I think most commercial users would
bypass a long wait -- they do, after all, have some work to do.

What about a checker that checks only that a file you're about to run
is what you expect, then?  This *may* be worthy of comment (heck, my
own code does that! :-) ), but it depends on how long it takes.  If it
takes me ten minutes to load Word Perfect on my trusty 4.77MHz, run
asophisticated authentication check against it and then finally get to
run it, well, my boss is not going to be too happy. So, the more
sophisticated the algorithm, the less likely it is to be used.  I know
this from my own beta testers for a new release of my own product:
they felt that the more sophisticated checker, although nice and more
trustworthy, simply took too long to run.  Given a choice, and they
make their choices known with their payments, they opt for one that's
"good enough".

What's a programmer to do, then?  My suggestion is easy: forget those
who claim that sophisticated checkers are what we need -- they may be
right, but there are many drawbacks to them, and we all still have
work to do!  Forget those who claim that their solution is the only
solution.  But, I'd rather have two unrelated and unsophisticated
algorithms that the "bad guy" knows nothing about, then one
"unbeatable" algorithm that goes unused.

Since there are umpteen different ways that such checkers could be
written, the odds of two such routines generating the same results
given a change in the source is pretty darned small.  And, if you're
still in doubt, then run a third or forth or 20th checker.....

Subject: Invisible INITs - Don't (Mac)

Any file which is invisible will not bec checked for INIT resources.
This means that GateKeeper and GateKeeper Aid are *not working*
because they have not gotten to install their hooks.

System 6.0.2 (I think) was the first System to add this check to the INIT
mechanism; this was done to help combat the Scores virus's famous invisible
"Desktop" and "Scores" files, which contained INITs.

Summary: Make INITs and cdev's invisible, and any INITs they install won't
         work.

Apple's System 6.0 and later will not execute INIT resources which reside
in invisible files.  This was done to prevent viruses (e.g. SCORES)
from dropping invisible INIT files into the System folder.  By making
the Gatekeeper and Gatekeeper Aid files invisible, you've rendered them
inoperative.

You can, if you wish, make the whole System folder invisible;  this won't
prevent the system from booting and won't prevent Gatekeeper etc. from
installing themselves.  For lab machines, this is often a reasonable
approach.

   Artificial Life has only recently emerged as a coherent field of
   scientific research. Its primary methodological approach is to study
   life and evolution by attempting to actually create living and/or
   evolving processes within computers, beakers, or other ``artificial''
   media. Its primary goal is to abstract the ``logical form'' of life
   from its material basis - and to construct a truly general theory of
   living systems, one which will be capable of treating life wherever it
   is found in the universe and whatever it is made of. ``Artificial'' Life
   can contribute to the study of ``real'' life by helping to locate
   life-as-we-know-it within the larger context of life-as-it-could-be,
   in any of its possible incarnations.

   This will be the second workshop on the topic of Artificial Life. The
   workshop will include invited and contributed talks, demonstrations,
   and discussions on the many scientific, technical, philosophical, and
   moral issues surrounding the increasing attempts to synthesize life
   artificially. We will also have an artificial ``4H show'' with prizes
   for the best artificial life-forms.

   Specific investigations in the field of Artificial Life include attempts
   to synthesize, simulate, or otherwise recreate the following:

   - the emergence of autocatalytic sets within soups of artificial polymers;

   - the evolution of strings of code using Genetic Algorithms;

   - self-reproducing bit-strings, clay-crystals, RNA molecules, or LEGO-robots
;

   - the emergence of cooperativity, colonial organization, multi-cellularity,
       and hierarchical organization;

   - the embryological processes of growth, development, and differentiation;

   - the emergence of social behavior in populations of artificial insects;

   - the emulation of population and ecosystem dynamics;

   - the implementation of artificial environments, logical universes,
       or ``virtual realities'' sufficiently rich to support the open-ended
       evolution of embedded ``organisms'';

   - cultural evolution, including the origin and evolution of socio-
       cultural institutions, and the evolution of natural language in its
       role as a vehicle for cultural inheritance;

   - the dynamics of self-propagating information structures such as
       biological and computer viruses;

   Many of the investigations mentioned above will be reported on or
   discussed at the workshop.

   We expect that there will also be plenty of debate on the question of
   whether or not symbolic processes within computers can be considered
   ``alive'' in principle, or whether they could be capable of participating
   in anything like truly open-ended evolution. These debates will probably
   parallel to a large extent the debates in the AI community on whether
   processes within computers can considered to be ``intelligent'' or
   ``conscious.''

   We are also encouraging presentations and/or debates on the moral and
   social consequences of achieving the capability to create living things.
   The mastery of the technology of life will easily overshadow any of our
   previous technological accomplishments - even our mastery of the technology
   of death - in terms of the burden of responsibility which it places on our
   shoulders. As was the case for the mastery of atomic fission and fusion,
   the potential abuses are directly proportional to the potential benefits.
   Once again, we are in a position where our technical understanding of nature
   is far in advance of our understanding of the potential consequences
   of mastering or deploying the technology. This is not an enterprise to
   be undertaken lightly, or to be pursued in the cause of such shortsighted
   goals as fleeting military advantage.

   The increasing spread and sophistication of computer viruses is evidence
   both of the imminence of this new era in the history of life, and of the
   complexity of the problems and issues that will be facing all of us in
   the not-too-distant future.

   We welcome your presence and contribution on any aspect of Artificial
   Life that you consider worth presenting or discussing with others
   who are interested in such issues. Whether you are a scientist, an
   engineer, a philosopher, an artist, or just a concerned citizen, we
   feel that ALL points of view need to be aired at this early stage in
   the evolution of Artificial Life.

well, but neither of them was installed on a user's machine (thanks to
the warnings from this (now) esteemed forum). Please note that it is
extremely likely that many folks in international organizations (UN,
World Bank, etc.) will be sent this disk when they have ever dropped a
business card at some computer show.

        By the way, I *really* think the US reaction is a little
overdone, I'm sure that Noriega doesn't even know a keyboard from an
M16...

I just received a message from Australia, describing "Flu", a new
virus, that uses a good deal of self-modifying code. Does anyone have
more information ?
