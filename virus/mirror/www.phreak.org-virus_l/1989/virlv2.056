The recent messages regarding re-formatting microcomputer lab disks
made me wonder what other sites are doing in their micro labs to
protect themselves.  At Lehigh, we're using Novell Local Area Networks
to act as file servers; the LAN hard disks are read-only (with the
exception of a scratchpad area).  Also, the boot floppies for the LAN
workstations are notchless.  It is interesting to note that the only
labs that got infected by the recent virus (Lehigh Virus version 2,
February 3, 1989) were ones which do not yet have LANs installed.

P.S. I will be out of town on business on Monday, Tuesday, and
Wednesday of next week, so VIRUS-L will not be distributed for a
while.  Bear in mind that urgent virus *warnings* may be distributed
via VALERT-L during this time.  I apologize for any inconvenience that
this may cause.
