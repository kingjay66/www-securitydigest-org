Subject: Re: VIRUS-L Guidelines???
 
 Fred Hartmann asked in V2 #84 about redistribution to other sites of
VIRUS-L, and worried about people using information appearing here to
make better viruses/worms/whatever. I'd like to point out that VIRUS-L
is already pretty wide-spread -- I'm reading it on Usenet, for example
(through a set of UofToronto-wide newsgroups which are gatewayed with
various mailing lists).
 
 Unless you know for sure otherwise, it's wise to assume any message
sent to a public mailing list will be rebroadcast to the world and
thus not put anything in such messages you don't mind the world
seeing. It's also a maxim of security that the bad guys know all of
this information already, but the good guys don't (bad guys have lots
of communication methods).
 
[people interested in a long discussion on the above maxim should
check out back issues of RISKS DIGEST.]

Subject: Availability of FluShot+ (PC)
 
I notice that the latest issue of PC Magazine rates FluShot+ quite
well (one of two Editor's Choices).  Does anyone know of either an
Internet or BITNET source for this shareware program?  I know it's
available on some BBSs and CompuServ, but I'd prefer to download it at
something faster than the 1200 baud speed I'm stuck with at home.  By
the way, I nosed around the MSDOS.Trojan-Pro files on SIMTEL20, and
was surprised not to have found it there.  Any ideas?

Subject: need source for ibm/mac anti-viral programs
 
I am as consultant for Utah state university, and we have several open
labs.  We have a recurring problem with virii cropping up, and I was
qwondering if there was a good (and hopefully free) archive or
repositiory of anti-viral software for those systems that is current
and available through bitnet/internet?
 
I have the index from lehiibm1 and from scfvm.  are ther any other good
sources?
 
Thanks a million.

Subject: Cohen paper in C&S
 
The latest issue of Computers & Security has an interesting article by
Dr. Cohen entitled "Practical Defenses Against Computer Viruses".  In
the paper, he (Dr. Cohen) presents various techniques for notifying
the user of any change in executable files before they get executed.
At least one of his techniques utilizes his cryptographic checksum
method of digital signatures.  (This method was described in an
earlier C&S article.)  Of particular interest to me are the benchmark
times which he mentions for the various levels of his protection
scheme (he discusses prototypes on various different machines).  The
times seem to be exceptionally fast, and certainly acceptable.
 
I'd be very interested to see an implementation (Unix and/or MS-DOS)
of his S3 level protection, if anyone has done one (or is working on
one).
