Subject: boot sector vaccine (PC)
 
I liked Mr. Fragakis' idea of filling memory with CLI and HLT
instructions, but the offsets in the boot sector which he mentioned
seem to be occupied by active code on my DOS 3.3 disk, so I wrote my
own patch for 3.3.  I used a different method though: when the boot
sector gets control, the only other active code in the machine should
be ROM code, so ALL the active interrupt vectors should be pointing
into ROM.  (As far as I can see, INTs are the only way for a boot
virus to get periodic, transparent control of the machine, right?)  So
what the patch does is scan interrupt vectors in the range 0H to 1CH,
and 40H, which point to addresses between 0 and C8000.  (If such a
vector exists when the boot sector gets control, the machine is
infected) If it finds such a vector, it prints the message VIRUS
ALERT!! and halts the machine.  I had to rearrange some strings in the
sector to get things to fit.  This has been run on two true blue IBM
XT's and seems to work fine.  I'd be interested in reports from other
machines, particularly the IBM AT, where the bios might set up the
vector table differently at bootup.  Run the following batch file with
a dos 3.3 boot disk in drive A:
- --------------------
rem This will patch the boot sector of a dos 3.3 disk to detect
rem interrupt redirection for interrupts 0H through 1CH, and 40H.

The same happens to some of our students every year. If this happens
here, it's no virus! The students don't listen to us, if we tell them
how to use floppy disks. Everytime someone comes to me with an
unreadable floppy, I look (with my eyes) at it and find a fingerprint
of the user on the floppy.  Maybe you have the same problem

I have worked with a program that uses the graphic mode of my EGA.
After some time the picture started to move to all the directions...
Did anyone have heared about this virus (if it is one...)?

Subject: Virus writing - crime?
 
I am new on this discussion and i think that the topic that i am
discussing have probly discussed before.
 
My question is if virus writing is a crime. I have thought of this
question a lot. At the begining i thought that it must be a crime
because people write this program in order to erase data to other
people but then i thought that if you do not copy diskettes you do not
have viruses. Diskette copying is a crime, ofcourse, so virus writing
is not a crime because people wouldn't had them unless they copy
diskettes.
 
Does any one know the law aspects about this matter?
 
Feel free to answer!

Call For Discussion:  The Usenet Virus Handbook  (With apologies to the
                                             mailing list people, please
                                             feel free to join in.)
 
With the advent of comp.virus and the establishment of virus tool
archives, I think it appropriate to organize a Handbook from
information available from the network.  The goal I have in mind is to
provide a *one-stop* source on what a virus (or trojan horse, etc.)
is, how they work and spread, and what can be done to prevent
infection and/or cure infections.  I don't have the virus guru's who
read this group in mind, but rather the average user who needs to be
educated if virii and other nasties are ever to be snuffed out.
 
Much of the information to accomplish this is already out there
(pointing to the info that Norstad et al. supplies with Disinfectant
and the virus 101 series as examples).  Thus, what I propose is to
form an editor *staff* to accumulate and organize the information and
keep it upto date.  My current concept is to have a general guide
(which sticks to general information) and then a number of supplements
each covering a different computing system.  This way, an interested
party can get the general guide and the particular supplement he/she
desires.  This information can then be carried in archives for easy
access.
 
The get the ball rolling, here are some discussion questions (besides
the obvious this is a good/bad idea one):
 
(1) How much information should be provided in the general guide?
Many users haven't the slightest idea what is a boot sector or what
use is ResEdit.  Perhaps the general section should have three
chapters: Beginner, Advanced, and a Secret chapter distributed only to
trusted individuals (although I suspect the latter one already
exists!).
 
(2) How best do we handle duplicate effort?  I would like any person
who can contribute to participate and I wouldn't want to put anyone in
the position of having to decide that X is preferable over Y.  We'll
need an equitable way to deal deserving people into the action.
 
(3) How do we assemble the editor staff?  Certainly, some of the
people who are now writing/collection things are natural choices (but
it's not my place to volunteer their time).  I think we should take
volunteers and then settle any races preferably by discussion or by
vote.
 
(4) How much staff do we need?  One or two for each supplement? One
for each general chapter? Should we have a chief editor or two to
oversee the whole effort and help to assure that project goals are
being met?  How about a temporary peer review group to evaluate each
section as the guide is being built for the first time?
 
(5) How about a different name for the effort?
 
Since a moderated group isn't the most convienent for this discussion,
can anyone suggest a group we could use (invade) to hash-out these
details to assemble a formal proposal?
 
I would appreciate some feedback (if you want to comment on my genetic
or moral backgroud, fine but please use e-mail :-) ).

Sounds more like the disk dropped a few bits rather than a virus
infection Gregg.
 
(not =)VIR is a resource added to a Desktop file by Woodhead's
Interferon application.  It is nothing to worry about.

Subject: Macintosh Virus forum now on FIDOnet...
 
Garner Miller has started a Macintosh Virus forum over FIDOnet called
"MacVIR".  If you use a FIDOnet BBS, you may wish to ask the Sysop to
pick up this conference (I do not believe it is on the FIDO backbone
yet; if enough people ask for it though, the backbone will pick it up
though).
 
This does not constitute an endorsement of anything or anyone.

Subject: Summary of problem posted to VALERT-L (5/19) (Mac)
 
I posted to VALERT-L on Friday, May 19, concerning a possible Mac virus
problem.
 
First I'd like to thank all those who responded - your suggestions
were helpful.  At this point I think it is safe to say that my problem
was generated by a legitimate disk error, and that there was no virus
activity involved.  While I still do not understand the events fully,
I cannot reproduce any of the activity, and so it would appear that
they were isolated and not the result of execution of code.  I will,
however, keep a close eye on these machines for any indication of
unusual activity.
 
If anyone is interested in a more detailed description of my problems,
please feel free to write.  Once again, thanks for the help.  - Gregg

Subject:      Virus Maker (PC)
 
I was shocked when a friend of mine gave me a diskette for the IBM PC
which contains a Virus Maker! I examined the program and this is what
it does: It knows four types of viruses and then, it asks you to
insert a diskette and it will put one of the viruses (the one you
tells her), on you diskette.
 
Did anyone see this kind of program before?? I didn't!

Another new virus....
 
This time as far as i understand it doesn't upload it self on a hard disk
but it does load it-self on floppy disks.
 
The thing that you see on the screen it simple....when you work in
text mode, every 5 seconds (something like that), one letter falls
from the screen and a blank character it written instead of her.
 
I made a small research about this virus and it turned out that the
boot record of the diskette with the virus on it, was chnged. The
first JMP command in the boot-record was changed to something else.
This virus marks track 39 sector 8 as bad (it stores the virus there).
 
Has any-one ever seen or heard of this virus?

Subject: Stop a BOOT virus at BOOT time (PC)
 
I just want to correct my recent comments concerning Stanley
Fragakis's alteration of the boot program to stop a boot virus at boot
time by overwriting everything in RAM (except the boot program
itself).  I have actually tried the alterations on a couple floppies
and they seem to work fine (i.e. they do not interfere with normal
operation of the computer).  If the floppy is not a system disk and
you try to boot from it, the computer does not die and you do get the
standard error message, contrary to my previous comment.  Also, the
alterations should work fine with system disks (The boot program
overwrites memory prior to loading the operating system into memory,
so there is no problem).
