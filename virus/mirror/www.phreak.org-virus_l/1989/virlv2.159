Subject: query re: archive access
 
Can someone tell me how to get at the LISTSERV virus archives.
 
[Ed. Send mail to LISTSERV@LEHIIBM1.BITNET (same as
LISTSERV@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU - for Internet users) containing one or
more of the following commands:
 
HELP                      - to get help
INDEX VIRUS-L             - to get a list of available files
GET filename filetype     - to retrieve a particular file (via e-mail)

While I was lucky enough to be on vacation when CHRISTMA hit
VNET, my impression is that (press to the contrary), VNET
handled it about like BITNET did: a few nodes shut down or
cold started, but most just installed and ran some filters
on RSCS and local spool.   Lots of human and CPU time and net
bandwidth wasted, but not a system-wide shutdown.  This is
just an unofficial impression, of course!
 
As far as I know, it's no harder to get a file from BITNET to
VNET now than it was before CHRISTMA; the person you want to
talk to on the VNET side has to be authorized with the gateway.
Exactly how an IBMer gets authorized for BITNET access varies
with site/division/etc.   I'm authorized, for instance, and I
can be sent mail from BITNET just by sending in the normal way
to CHESS at YKTVMV (let's not all try this just to be sure it
works, of course!  Hehe).

This just became a bit of a hot topic here today.  We noted the report
in our newsletter and have been receiving calls about it.  Most have been
from users who have "Dos power tools" and want to know if their machine
will roll over any time soon.  One, interestingly, was from Bantam.  They
wanted to know where we got this from.
 
Anyway, have there been any more reports regarding this virus?  I got the
impression from the above that if a copy of "Dos power tools" had the
virus people found out quick.  Any other news in general on this?

Subject: Wanted: Beta Testers for Flu_Shot+ (PC)
 
I'm all set to release a new version of FLU_SHOT+ and need some people
as beta testers (all my current beta testers opted to take the summer
off, those lucky dogs!).
 
Requirements: MS-DOS 2.x - 4.x.  In particular, I'm looking for 4.x
people (there were some problems with the last release and 4.x)
 
Send *me* E-mail, not the list.  Many thanks.

Subject: RE: the CHRISTMA EXEC on BITNET and VNET (IBM VM/CMS)
 
I have been reading the discussions on VM/CMS as pertaining to viruses and
security with some interest.  I was the Senior Consultant/Programmer at a
small college for a system running VM/CMS when the CHRISTMA EXEC program
was making its rounds.
 
There were two of us who had complete control over the machine we were work-
ing on (a 4341-2 w/1500 accounts) which made it extremely easy to spot and
eradicate the CHRISTMA EXEC.  We routinely checked the number of Reader (mail)
files on our machine.  We noticed an increase in files over the span of a few
hours that was unusual so we checked our RSCS spool to see if anything unusual
was happening and spotted the CHRISTMA EXEC file showing up repeatedly.  We
then took a look at the CHRISTMA EXEC (which we had both received) and
realized what it was doing.  At this point we wrote a few lines of code to
search for all occurrences of the CHRISTMA EXEC on the system (in Reader or
on disk) and to delete any that were found.  We warned our users not to run
the CHRISTMA EXEC (in case we missed any) and then we periodically checked
for the EXEC over the next few days.  We did not think of putting the check
directly into RSCS, which is a better idea.
 
The reason I bothered to write this was to make note of the possibility that
those places where people dealt directly with their machines and the operating
systems seemed to catch the CHRISTMA EXEC almost immediately, whereas on the
IBM VNET many of the machines ran systems such as PROFS that separate the
users from the operating system and most of the machines were maintained by
a larger number of people who had less direct control over their environ-
ments.  I'm not advocating either system over the other, but, to us, it was
interesting how trivial a problem the CHRISTMA EXEC was to deal with.  On
IBM's VNET, however, the offending program was not noticed until network
traffic had become so high, and system spool resources were becoming full
enough (I assume) that they were forced to shut the network down.
 
This begs the question as to whether or not systems that are designed to be
user friendly and administrations that are set up to keep access to data
restricted are more susceptible to viruses/worms/trojan horses.  I don't
expect to answer this question, but it does seem to be a re-occurring theme
when dealing with viruses.

Subject: update to F-PROT.ARC (PC)
 
I'm sending out an update to the f-prot package.  Apparently there is
some problem with one of the programs and some TSR programs.  The
F-LOCK.EXE program is being replaced in this update.
