The information is also in the Bios Parameter Block (BPB) in the
boot sector, and you're asking for trouble if the FAT and BPB
disagree.  A while back there was a claim in PC Magazine that
PC-DOS 3.3 required that the OEM id field in the boot sector
contain the characters "IBM".  The evidence offered for this was
that if the boot sector on a disk which PC-DOS 3.3 rejected was
replaced by a boot sector from an acceptable disk, the disk
became acceptable.  In fact, what was really happening was that
there was bad information in the BPB, and PC-DOS was complaining
about this.  I have a program called SCAT, which I got off of
BIX, which writes a valid boot sector on a floppy.  The original
purpose was to replace a non-standard boot sector which FastBack
writes, but perhaps it would also be useful for removing a boot
sector virus.  If there's any interest, I could send a copy to
the moderator for posting.

It's true that if your network is only used for printing that CURRENTLY
KNOWN Mac viruses can't spread over the network.  Some electronic mail
software, though, lets users exchange files or even applications.  If an
application that's infected is transferred in this way, the infection
WILL be transferred.
 
There is no simple way of "protecting" servers themselves against the
infection of the files they hold.  If an application stored on the server
is executed by a person using an infected machine, that application will
probably be infected.  You cannot run such things as Vaccine or GateKeeper
or SAM Intercept on a server machine.  Well, you can, but it only keeps
software being run ON the server from being infected; it does nothing to
prevent software that RESIDES on the server from being infected.  The
best way to do that is still to make sure that each workstation is as
secure as possible, using frequent checks with Disinfectant, Virex, or
SAM (currently the three most up to date programs), and protection with
such programs as Vaccine, GateKeeper, or SAM Intercept (the best of the
three, but not free).
 
For the curious, SAM is a new package of antiviral utilities from Symantec,
the same people who created SUM.  It stands for Symantec Antivirus for
the Macintosh.  I haven't finished evaluating it, but it looks great.  I
will post more about it shortly.

Subject: Ashar virus article
 
A comparison of Ashar and Brain
 
Recently, an academic institution in the South of England (who do not
wish to be named) finished cleaning out a virus that put " (c) ashar"
as the volume label.  They sent us a specimen for analysis - here are
our findings.
 
Ashar is very similar to Brain, which has been described in detail
elsewhere.  But there are some interesting differences, which are
worth documenting, and they lead to a tentative conclusion.
 
Difference 1
 
The volume label that is put on the diskette is " (c) ashar" instead
of " (c) Brain".  The text in the boot sector contains "(c) 1986 ashar
& ashars (pvt) Ltd      VIRUS_SHOE RECORD" and the "V9.0" is absent.
The rest of the text "Dedicated to the dynamic memories" etc is
exactly the same, including the mis-spelling of "messeges" and the
grammatical errors.
 
Difference 2
 
In Ashar, the volume label is put into the first available directory
entry, whereas with Brain, it cannot be put into the first or second
entry.  If there is a volume label on one of the first two entries, an
attempt to install the system will fail, making the virus more
noticeable and more of a nuisance.
 
Difference 3
 
The body of the virus, and the stored (original) boot sector, is
placed in three fake bad clusters.  In Brain, this must be on or after
cluster 55;  the purpose of this is probably to allow space for the
Dos system files.  Ashar allows the body of the virus to be on any
free cluster on the diskette.
 
Difference 4
 
Brain uses quite a complicated encryption scheme to encode the volume
label that it places on diskettes, presumably to make it harder for
someone to change it.  Ashar uses a much simpler scheme.  It stores
the volume label as a character string, in negated form, so that all
you have to do to decode it is a NEG instruction.
 
There are 11 bytes in Brain, which was previously thought to contain
rubbish.  These 11 bytes are the negated " (c) ashar ".  Immediately
after these, there is " (c) ashar $" in clear.  These 11 bytes, and
the cleartext, are unused by Brain.
 
Difference 5
 
Ashar resets the floppy disk controller before reading or writing to
the device in a number of places;  Brain does the reset after the
access if it fails.
 
Difference 6
 
When Brain is installed in memory, and you try to look at the boot
sector of a diskette, Brain reads the original boot sector that has
been stored further down the diskette, and shows you that normal boot
sector instead.  This applies to programs that use the data in the
boot sector, but also to Debug, Norton, Mace, PC-Tools and other disk
sector editors.  One of the effects of this is to mislead you into
thinking that the diskette is normal.
 
Ashar stores the original boot sector of the diskette, and uses it to
continue the boot process after an attempt has been made to boot from
an infected floppy.  But it does not redirect subsequent attempts to
read the boot sector.  When you look at the boot sector, you see an
infected boot sector.
 
Conclusion on Brain
 
Ashar and Brain are definitely two versions of the same virus;  the
code is nearly the same, apart from the differences documented above.
But Brain has a sophistications that Ashar doesn't have, such as the
boot-read redirection, the space left in the FAT and directory for the
installation of the system, and the greatly improved encryption
system.
 
Brain contains, as an unused remnant, the NEG-encrypted Ashar volume
label.  That would tend to imply that Ashar predates Brain, and the
greater sophistications in Brain tend to confirm this.  This would
imply that Ashar was the precursor to Brain.
 
If this is true, then the version of Brain which has not got the
telephone numbers on the boot sector (but has "Dedicated to the
memories"), is previous to the version with the telephone numbers,
which would imply that the telephone numbers version is a hack of the
real Brain.  It is very easy to change the boot sector - any disk
sector editor would allow that.
 
Until Ashar, we had no way of telling whether the "Dedicated to the
memories" version came before or after the telephone numbers version.
Now we have a strong indication that the telephone numbers version
came afterwards.
 
One possibility is that Ashar is a kind of hoax;  a computer-virus
Piltdown that is intended to mislead virus researchers.  It would be
very difficult to change Brain to Ashar or vice versa unless you had
the source code, or a very good disassembly.  Why should anyone try to
fool virus "palaeontologists" in this way, when such researchers
scarcely exist (yet).  And it would seem to be a pretty pointless
exercise - if a programmer was that good and wanted to make their
mark, they would not have simplified Brain, they would have
complicated it, or even used it as a basis to write a completely
different, and much worse, virus.
 
So, if the telephone-numbers version of Brain comes after the
"Dedicated to the memories", the numbers are probably nothing to do
with the virus, and the whole story of the Brain brothers and the
writing of the virus comes into doubt.
 
More general conclusion
 
In order to discover this kind of information, viruses from the field
must be carefully analysed.  We need some way for virus researchers to
be able to exchange specimens.  Reports of vcrus sightings, and
summaries and catalogues of viruses are obviously very useful, but to
generate the raw material from which these can be produced, actual
specimens must be analysed by researchers.

Subject: Denzuk virus article
 
DENZUK
 
DENZUK is a Boot Sector Virus.  It replaces the original boot sector
with its own - this looks very like a normal boot sector, as it has
the usual messages "Non-System disk or disk error", "Replace and
strike any key when ready" and "Disk Boot failure".  It also has the
references to IBMBIO.COM and IBMDOS.COM.  If your system files are
called IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS, DENZUK doesn't realize this, but it does
mean that the boot sector looks normal.
 
When the boot sector runs, it loads in the rest of the virus, which is
located on track 40 (normal 360k diskettes have tracks numbered 0 to
39), head 0, sectors 33 to 41 (normal tracks are numbered from 1).
Putting the virus in this place means that some disk-searching
utilities won't find it there.  It also means that if you Diskcopy the
infected diskette, most of the virus fails to copy.  This gives us one
simple way to clean up an infection - DENZUK could almost be called a
copy-protected virus!  If you Diskcopy an infected diskette, the
DENZUK boot is copied, but not the rest of DENZUK.  If you use COPY or
XCOPY to copy the diskette, then the infected boot is left behind
also.  Of course, you must boot from a known clean diskette before you
start.
 
When DENZUK runs the code that it has loaded in from track 40, it
replaces two of the PC's interrupts, $13 (diskette) and 9 (keyboard).
A new interrupt is installed, $6F, which is the old interrupt $13;
DENZUK uses this as a short way to call the original routine.  The new
interrupt 9 looks for two keystrokes.  On seeing a Ctrl-Alt-Del, it
calls a routine that displays its logo (if it is running on anything
apart from a mono monitor), and then reboots.  The other keystroke is
Ctrl-Alt-F5, which just triggers a reboot.  This is a convenient test
to see if you are infected, as on a PC that is not running DENZUK,
Ctrl-Alt-F5 does nothing.  All other keystrokes are passed on to
the original interrupt 9 routine.
 
The DENZUK logo is a graphic, with the words "DEN ZUK" in large red
letters.  The pixels making up these letters come in from each side
until they merge making the words; there is also a symbol to the side
that looks rather like a stylised globe.
 
Interrupt $13 is used to infect more diskettes.  Every time interrupt
$13 is called, provided it is referencing one of the two floppy drives
(DENZUK will not infect a hard disk), and provided the call is a read,
write, verify or format, DENZUK will decrement its infection counter
(which is initially set to eight).  When the counter reaches zero,
this triggers the infection process, and the counter is set back to
two.
 
The infection process works like this.  First it reads the sector at
cylinder 0, head 0, sector 1.  It looks for two bytes that are found
in DENZUK, and if it finds them, it doesn't infect.  If they are
absent, it looks for two other bytes which we surmise are an old
version of DENZUK;  if it finds those, it calls the "Find Denzuk Boot"
routine, whereby it reads the boot sector from trach 40, head 0,
sector 33 which is where the original boot is stored.  Thus, DENZUK
will update you if it finds that you are running an out-of-date
version of the virus.
 
If DENZUK finds Brain (or Ashar) virus on the boot sector (which it
does by looking for the $1234 signature of Brain) then it upgrades you
from Brain to DENZUK.  First, though, it has to go and find the boot
sector from where Brain has put it;  Brain has three bytes on sector
cylinder 0, head 0, sector 1 that tells you where the original boot
sector is, and DENZUK decodes these and reads the boot sector.
 
Whether the diskette was clean, old-DENZUK or Brain, DENZUK now has
the original boot sector.  It formats track 40 head 0, and writes its
nine sectors there.  If this write is successful (some diskette drives
may not allow writing beyond track 39) then it replaces the sector at
cylinder 0, head 0 sector 1 with its own version of the boot sector.
The infection process is now complete.  It then scans through the
directory to see if there is a volume labels there.  Brain, you may
recall, puts " (c) Brain" as a volume label on the diskette.  DENZUK
overwrites that with its own label, which is "Y.C.1.E.R.P", where the
.  is character $F9.  DENZUK assumes that it is looking at a 360k
diskette, but makes no attempt to ensure that this is the case.
This directory scan starts at sector 0, 0, 6, and scans through
seven sectors; just right for a 360k diskette.  The meaning of this
volume label is obscure.
 
There is also a generation counter, which keeps track of how many
generations have passed;  if this is less than three, then DENZUK
refrains from its visible signs - the logo is not displayed on reboot,
and the volume label is not changed.  The specimen that we had
was generation $14. This feature is probably to give it a chance to
spread a bit before detecting it becomes easy.
 
DENZUK puts the BRAIN signature on the boot sector - this would stop
Brain from infecting a DENZUK-infected diskette. So in a population
of Brain-infected diskettes, DENZUK would tend tobe the virus that
would get the upper hand.
 
There are a couple of text messages in the virus, which are not
displayed. These are:
 
At the beginning:
 
"Welcome to the
    C l u b
- --The HackerS--
    Hackin'
All The Time   "
 
At the end:
 
"The HackerS"
 
It might be thought that DENZUK is actually a helpful virus, in that
it kills Brain.  This is not so - consider what will happen if DENZUK
infects a diskette with more than 40 tracks.  Track 40 would be
overwritten, and data could be lost as a result.  Even worse, DENZUK
assumes that all diskettes are 360 kb diskettes, so when it infects
them, it puts a 360 kb diskette boot sector on top of the old boot
sector.  This tells Dos that the diskette has 2+2 FAT sectors and 7
directory sectors, which is not the case.  So Dos is not able to read
the diskette properly, and interprets the directory as part of the
FAT, and (depending on what diskette it is) can get the cluster size
wrong, and might ignore some of the sectors on each track.  In other
words, DENZUK infecting a 5 1.4 inch 1.2 mb diskette leaves it
unreadable, although putting a correct boot sector back in place will
rescue most of the data (trach 40 head 0 is gone for ever).  Other
capacity diskettes (other than 360 kb) will also have problems.
 
Our specimen of DENZUK came from an academic institution in the UK,
which prefers to remain unnamed. It is the only reported instance
of DENZUK in the UK so far, apart from lab specimens.
 
We have added tools for dealing with DENZUK to our Anti Virus Toolkit.

Not to worry. Sounds like someone has installed ColorFinder on your
Mac.  It just hooks the ICON-drawing trap and puts up prettier icons.
Look around in your System Folder for the ColorFinder file. You can
simply trash it if you don't like it.

Sounds to me like the Beta Release of Multi-Finder (called Juggler I
believe) which vastly improved the Macintosh Icons, but, alas, they
were their same old ugly selves when it was finally released.

Subject: Shareware? Hmm... (Mac)
 
I received a visit from a Mac user here at NASA this morning who was
very upset about a letter he received concerning Virus Detective(tm).
 
It seems that he had decided that he wanted to keep VD, so after reading
the dialog telling where to send the money and how much, he sent in
a check for $25. (He had version 2.2; I verified that the "Credits"
dialog up to and including version 3.0 specified this amount).
 
He then received a letter from the author *billing* him for an extra
$15! It seems that the price went up with version 3.0.1. (I verified
that too.)
 
He has returned the disk which was sent him and has requested his money
back. I have never heard of any shareware author billing anyone before.
 
I'd appreciate opinions on whether we should continue to support the
author by making this software available. I'd even more appreciate a
direct response from the author, if he reads this list.
 
I'm posting this partly in the hope that he will respond, and partly
because I truly dislike denying access to a good tool possibly because
of a one-time mistake or misunderstanding. I'd appreciate _direct_ replies
from the readers of this list as to their thoughts and feelings on the
subject. Thanks.

Chris, I think you've misunderstood what Michael stated.  INIT29 can indeed
spread to data files, but as far as I know, it is not capable of spreading
*from* data files back to applications.
 
Also, for anyone using Macs and trying to teach others about what things
to be aware, may I recommend highly a Hypercard stack called the Virus
Encyclopedia which is available on GEnie and probably other places.
(The author's name is Henry C. Schmitt, and he's from the Northwest of
Us, a user group in Arlington Heights, IL.)  Also the informational
screens from John Norstad's Disinfectant are very helpful.
