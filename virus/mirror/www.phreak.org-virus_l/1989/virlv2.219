VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

                             CERT Advisory
                            October 17, 1989
                        DEC/Ultrix 3.0 Systems

Recently, the CERT/CC has been working with several Unix sites that have
experienced breakins.  Running tftpd, accounts with guessable passwords
or no passwords, and known security holes not being patched have been the
bulk of the problems.

The intruder, once in, gains root access and replaces key programs
with ones that create log files which contain accounts and passwords in
clear text.  The intruder then returns and collects the file.  By using
accounts which are trusted on other systems the intruder then installs
replacement programs which start logging.

There have been many postings about the problem from several other net
users.  In addition to looking for setuid root programs in users' home
directories, hidden directories '..  ' (dot dot space space), and a modified
telnet program, we have received two reports from Ultrix 3.0 sites that
the intruders are replacing the /usr/bin/login program.  The Ultrix security
hole being used in these attacks is only found in Ultrix 3.0.

Suggested steps:
        1) Check for a bogus /usr/bin/login.  The sum program reports:
                27379    67     for VAX/Ultrix 3.0

        2) Check for a bogus /usr/etc/telnetd.  The sum program reports:
                23552    47     for VAX/Ultrix 3.0

        3) Look for .savacct in either /usr/etc or in users' directories.
           This may be the file that the new login program creates.  It
           could have a different name on your system.

        4) Upgrade to Ultrix 3.1 ASAP.

        5) Monitor accounts for users having passwords that can be found in
           the /usr/dict/words file or have simple passwords like a persons
           name or their account name.

        6) Search through the file system for programs that are setuid root.

        7) Disable or modify the tftpd program so that anonymous access to
           the file system is prevented.

If you find that a system that has been broken into,  changing the password
on the compromised account is not sufficient.  The intruders do remove copies
of the /etc/passwd file in order to break the remaining passwords.  It is best
to change all of the passwords at one time.  This will prevent the intruders
from using another account.

Please alert CERT if you do find a problem.

Thank you,

                     "WANK" Worm On SPAN Network


On 16 October, the CERT received word from SPAN network control that a
worm was attacking SPAN VAX/VMS  systems.  This worm affects only DEC
VMS systems and is  propagated via DECnet protocols,  not TCP/IP protocols.
If a VMS system had other network connections, the worm was not programmed
to take advantage of those connections.  The worm is very similar to last
year's  HI.COM  (or Father Christmas) worm.

This is NOT A PRANK.  Serious security holes are left open by this worm.
The worm takes advantage of poor password management, modifies .com files,
creates a new account, and spreads to other systems via DECnet.

It is also important to understand that someone in the future could launch
this worm on any DECnet based network.  Many copies of the virus have been
mailed around.  Anyone running a DECnet network should be warned.

R. Kevin Oberman from Lawrence Livermore National Labs reports:
     "This is a mean bug to kill and could have done a lot of damage.
     Since it notifies (by mail) someone of each successful penetration
     and leaves a trapdoor (the FIELD account), just killing the bug is
     not adequate.  You must go in an make sure all accounts have
     passwords and that the passwords are not the same as the account
     name."

The CERT/CC also suggests checking every .com file on the system.  The
worm appends code to .com files which will reopen a security hole everytime
the program is executed.

An analysis of the worm appears below and is provided by R. Kevin Oberman of
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.  Included with the analysis is a
DCL program that will block the current version of the worm.  At least
two versions of this worm exist and more may be created.  This program
should give you enough time to close up obvious security holes.

If you have any technical questions or have an infected system, please
call the CERT/CC:

                          Report on the W.COM worm.
                               R. Kevin Oberman
                            Engineering Department
                    Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
                               October 16, 1989

The following describes the action of the W.COM worm (currently based on the
examination of the first two incarnations). The replication technique causes
the code to be modified slightly which indicates the source of the attack and
learned information.

All analysis was done with more haste than I care for, but I believe I have all
of the basic facts correct.

First a description of the program:

1. The program assures that it is working in a directory to which the owner
(itself) has full access (Read, Write,Execute, and Delete).

2. The program checks to see if another copy is still running. It looks for a
process with the first 5 characters of "NETW_". If such is found, it deletes
itself (the file) and stops its process.

                                     NOTE
A quick check for infection is to look for a process name starting with
"NETW_". This may be done with a SHOW PROCESS command.

3. The program then changes the default DECNET account password to a random
string of at least 12 characters.

4. Information on the password used to access the system is mailed to the user
GEMPAK on SPAN node 6.59. Some versions may have a different address.

5. The process changes its name to "NETW_" followed by a random number.

6. It then checks to see if it has SYSNAM priv. If so, it defines the system
announcement message to be the banner in the program:
      W O R M S    A G A I N S T    N U C L E A R    K I L L E R S
    _______________________________________________________________

         \___________________________________________________/
          \                                                 /
           \    Your System Has Been Officically WANKed    /
            \_____________________________________________/

     You talk of times of peace for all, and then prepare for war.

7. If it has SYSPRV, it disables mail to the SYSTEM account.

8. If it has SYSPRV, it modifies the system login command procedure to
APPEAR to delete all of a user's file. (It really does nothing.)

9. The program then scans the accounts logical name table for command
procedures and tries to modify the FIELD account to a known password
with login form any source and all privs. This is a primitive virus,
but very effective IF it should get into a privileged account.

10. It proceeds to attempt to access other systems by picking node numbers at
random. It then used PHONE to get a list of active users on the remote system.
It proceeds to irritate them by using PHONE to ring them.

11. The program then tries to access the RIGHTSLIST file and attempts
to access some remote system using the users found and a list of
"standard" users included with the worm. It looks for passwords
which are the same as that of the account or are blank. It records all
such accounts.

12. It looks for an account that has access to SYSUAF.DAT.

13. If a priv. account is found, the program is copied to that account and
started. If no priv account was found, it is copied to other accounts found on
the random system.

14. As soon as it finishes with a system, it picks another random system and
repeats (forever).

Response:

1. The following program will block the worm. Extract the following code
and execute it. It will use minimal resources. It create a process named
NETW_BLOCK which will prevent the worm from running.
- -------
Editors note:  This fix will work only with this version of the worm.
Mutated worms will require modification of this code; however, this
program should prevent the worm from running long enough to secure
your system from the worms attacks.
- -------
==============================================================================
$ Set Default SYS$MANAGER
$ Create BLOCK_WORM.COM
$ DECK/DOLLAR=END_BLOCK
$LOOP:
$ Set Process/Name=NETW_BLOCK
$ Wait 12:0
$ GoTo loop
END_BLOCK
$ Run/Input=SYS$MANAGER:BLOCK_WORM.COM/Error=NL:/Output=NL:/UIC=[1,4] -
    SYS$SYSTEM:LOGINOUT
==============================================================================
- -------
Editors note:  This fix might only work if the worm is running as SYSTEM.
An earlier post made by the CERT/CC suggested the following:
        $ Run SYS$SYSTEM:NCP
        Clear Object Task All
        ^Z

You must then edit the file SYS$MANAGER:STARTNET.COM, and add the line

        CLEAR OBJECT TASK ALL

AFTER the line which says

        SET KNOWN OBJECTS ALL

This has the side-effect of disabling users from executing any command
procedure via DECnet that the system manager has not defined in the
DECnet permanent database.
- ---------
2. Enable security auditing. The following command turns on the MINIMUM
alarms. The log is very useful in detecting the effects of the virus left by
the worm. It will catch the viruses modification of the UAF.
$ Set Audit/Alarm/Enable=(ACL,Authorization,Breakin=All,Logfailure=All)

3. Check for any account with NETWORK access available for blank passwords or
passwords that are the same as the username. Change them!

4. If you are running VMS V5.x, get a copy of SYS$UPDATE:NETCONFIG_UPDATE.COM
from any V5.2 system and run it. If you are running V4.x, change the username
and password for the network object "FAL".

5. If you have been infected, it will be VERY obvious. Start checking the
system for modifications to the FIELD account. Also, start scanning the system
for the virus. Any file modified will contain the following line:
$ oldsyso=f$trnlnm("SYS$OUTPUT")
It may be in LOTS of command procedures. Until all copies of the virus are
eliminated, the FIELD account may be changed again.

6. Once you are sure all of the holes are plugged, you might kill off
NETW_BLOCK. (And then again, maybe not.)

Subject: DECnet Worm on the loose


PLEASE NOTIFY ALL YOUR SITES...THERE IS A WORM ON THE LOOSE WITHIN THE

                               DECNET INTERNET

What we know:

It is called W.COM and moves by generating psuedo random node numbers.
It contains a set of default names like SYSTEM, FIELD, etc, it gets more
user names from rightslist.dat and apparently (we don't know for sure)
tries username = password to gain access.

It attempts to access your node via both the default DECnet account/TASK 0 and
a list of 81 canned userid's

If successful on your node, it will change the passwords of accounts it
has broken into and attempt to start up a batch job to continue its quest.

It runs AUTHORIZE and generates a listing of your usernames.  To this
list, it appends 81 other userid's it will try.  It then tries to
penetrate each account in it's list using both a null password and the
userid as the password. If an account is penetrated then the worm runs
under the penetrated account and do the following:

        o submit a batch job to attack other nodes
        o changes the user's password
        o sends a confirmation banner to a central node

What you can do quickly to protect yourself:


- -- disable TASK 0 if you have it running

- -- make sure that the DECnet account's UAF record does not have access to
 BATCH

- -- make sure that the DECnet account UAF record has /PRCLM=1 set

- -- protect SYS$SYSTEM:AUTHORIZE.EXE so that WORLD has NO access

- -- Create an empty W.COM;32767 in the DECnet Default account and protect

- -- WATCH FOR PROCESSES BEGINNING WITH "NETW_"

- -- Use "NCP> SHOW KNOWN LINKS" command to show your connections, then
   verify your "local users" to ensure that they are not running in BATCH
   mode - if so, it's a possible penetration.

*NOTE THESE MEASURES DO NOT PROTECT AGAINST USERS WHO HAVE THEIR PASSWORDS THE
 SAME AS THEIR USERID'S.

Subject: Nuclear Killers?

At risk of pointing out the obvious, the "Nuclear Killers" reference
in the current SPAN worm echoes items from this morning's news about
protesters in Florida attempting to disrupt the launch of a *nuclear
powered* shuttle payload.  Seems they're afraid of a Challenger-like
disaster spreading plutonium over half the state.

With all due respect to NASA, I'd probably be worried myself if I
lived nearby.

Subject: Quirks in shrink wrapped software (PC)

Just yesterday, as I was installing Lotus Freelance Plus, I began to
notice inconsistencies between Copyright registration procedures and
safe anti-virus practices.  The following is extracted from the manual
"Getting Started" on page 1-9.

" Step 1. Run FL_FIRST

  The FL_FIRST program validates your copy of Freelance Plus.  All
  users must run this program before backing up or using the Freelance
  Plus diskettes. "

Because this registration step involves writing the user and company
name to the original master, it is necessary to write-enable the disk
and put it in the machine.  However, being at the head of the
anti-virus campaign for the university, I noticed that this really
doesn't allow for safe security practices.  ALL documentation that I
have read or written to defend systems against viruses suggests that
all shrink wrapped software be write-protected and backed up before
that software is installed on the system, thereby insuring that you
will have at least one copy of everything that isn't infected by a
virus.

Assuming that my system has viruses, then I could safely say that
there is a good chance my Lotus Freelance Plus masters are also
infected.  Thanks Lotus for your insight on making my system secure...

it really is.  It seems to delete files one at a time on Friday 13,
becomes memory resident, slows down the system slightly, and
occasionally puts a black spot on the screen. I would like details

Three 5.25" DSDD floppies in my possession are reported by ViruScan
0.7V42 to be infected with the Disk Killer virus.  Since my system
is reported to be clean by ViruScan, and these were the disks I had
with me on a recent visit to Montreal, I am assuming that that is
where the infection came from.  I am in the process of notifying
the owners of the machines with which these disks had contact, and
will post again when the source is identifed.

Alan Roberts' statement in VIRUS-L of 26 Sept 89 is the only information
I have been able to find on Disk Killer.  Any info will be appreciated.

Subject: nVIR problems


We have a network in the Microcomputer lab with more than 20 Macintoshes
 connected to it. We have been experiencing a severe bout of nVIR. It is
usually nVIR-A or nVIR-B infecting the system or finder of the startup
diskettes. It has also spread, we believe, extensively among users before
we were alerted to it. The problem:

We were told that the DA VirusDetective did not always detect the viruses
probably. I haven't checked this personally. We started using SAM ... in the
meanwhile because disinfectant crashed the multifinder periodically. Today we
found that a diskette was reported by disinfectant to be virus-free BUT SAM ...
reported it as being infected and we had it "repair"ed using SAM....

I have forgotten the full name for the antiviral program SAM.... Can anyone
who is better informed enlighten us
a) Why Disinfectant(V 1.2) didn't warn us?
b) Is SAM whatever it is, better or is it just seeing ghosts (unlikely?)?
c) We have Vaccine on the network. Why did it not alert us at the beginning?
Actually, we caught on because vaccine eventually warned us. By that time
so many diskettes and the network itself had become infected that we had it
shut down.
d) Is it true that the DA VirusDetective is not as fully reliable (at least
for nVIR strains) as it should be?

I have now confirmed that the virus I reported in VALERT-L this morning
is indeed Disk Killer.  The boot sector signature, and the message texts
stored elsewhere on the disk, match those reported in VIRUS-L on
26 September by Alan Roberts.  There is one discrepancy: while
Alan reports that the message texts are stored at sector 152 (presumably
decimal) on floppy disks, on the infected disks in my possession they
are at sector 354 decimal (0x162).  This may therefore be a new strain.

I have not yet been able to trace the source of the infection; I will

Subject: DARK AVENGER WARNING (PC)

    A number of disturbing reports about scanning systems infected with
the Dark Avenger virus have just been substantiated by Kevin Harrington
at U.C. Davis and Morgan Schweers in Glen Cove N.Y.  It seems that the virus
infects any and every executable file that is opened for read or write.
Thus, if a system is scanned by VIRUSCAN or IBM's VIRSCAN, the virus begins
an uncontrollable infection of the system, resulting in corruption of
virtually everything in the system.  This turns what might have been a modest
disinfection task into a total nightmare.  VIRUSCAN version 45 has corrected
this problem by checking for the active virus in memory before attempting to
do a system scan.  Dave Chess and Art Gilbert at IBM have been made aware of
the problem (according to John McAfee) and a fix for their VIRSCAN program
should be forthcoming.  If you are using either of these products please get
the fixed version before scanning any system suspected of harboring this
virus.  If you are unable to do this, then scan only a floppy diskette
first.  This will risk only the files on your floppy.  If you have a "clean"
system master, then of course re-boot first to start from a clean system.
The problem most infected installations have, however, is finding a
guaranteed clean system disk, so proceed cautiously.  The safest thing,
again, is to use the updated versions of these programs.

Subject: DARK AVENGER WARNING (PC)

    ViruScan (version 43 and below) and Virscan (IBM's scanning program)
SHOULD NOT BE USED if a Dark Avenger infection is suspected.  These programs
cause an uncontrollable spread of the virus when they are used.  The virus
infects every executable file when the files are opened.  Both of these
programs open ALL executables, thus the virus saturates the system when it
is scanned.  VIRUSCAN version 45 has fixed this problem, and IBM will,
presumably, issue a new Virscan version shortly.  Kevin Harrington of
U.C. Davis and Morgan Schweers of Glen Cove, NY have reported that scanning
systems infected with this virus have turned what would have been a moderate
disinfection task into a monumental problem.  If anyone does have this virus,
the M-DAV disinfector on HomeBase will remove it and repair the damage.  The
board number is 408 988 4004.
