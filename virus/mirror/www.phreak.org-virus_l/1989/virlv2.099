Subject: Password protection based virus prevention
 
One way of helping prevent a virus infection is "password based access
control" How does this help?  I assume I have to enter a password to
be able to work on my micro.  I don't see how this helps, because as I
understand it viruses usually do there most damage while the micro is
in use.  Sooner or later I will have to use the micro; I am not
worried about protecting my micro from people I don't know maliciously
infecting my micro as a personal vendetta.  If I did not explain the
question sufficiently please feel free to contact me.
 
 
[Ed. A password for access control (such as on a PS/2), could help in
obtaining some level of physical security, by preventing unauthorized
persons from starting up a PC without the consent of the owner.  Also,
passwords don't have to be limited only to access control, at least in
this sense.  A password could conceivably be used to enter an
"administrator mode" during which executable files could be installed
and altered, but not executed.  During a normal "user mode",
executables could not be altered or installed, only executed.  If this
were sufficiently supported in hardware, it could reduce one's risk,
imho (in my humble opinion).  Indeed, it is very similar to the way in
which most multi-user systems work.]

>..even FLU_SHOT+, which catches only the crudest of viruses...
 
Harumpf, I say, Harumpf!
 
Maybe I'm a little biased, but I think that my FLU_SHOT program
catches a vast majority of the viruses out there in the MS-DOS world.
There are ways around it, of course, just as there are ways around
*any* anti-virus software.  But, at least the method of distribution
(shareware) allows a person to use the product for evaluation purposes
before having to spend a penny.
 
PCMag found it worthwhile enough around real viruses and a virus
simulator to give it their Editor's Choice Award.

Subject: Virus Info Request (PC)
 
I would like to request that anyone finding a new virus send me as
much information as possible on the virus, including reach information
(such as address and telephone number) so a disassembly can be
attempted.
 
I will do two things with this info: 1) enhance FLU_SHOT as required
to deal with it and 2) I'll prepare a report for the list on how the
virus works, and how to protect against it.

For Access to FLU_SHOT:
             RamNet BBS:  (212)-889-6438  (Free)
             CompuServe, PCMagNet         (Free Signup, download @ $12/hr)
             BIX                          ($39/quarter)
             SimTel-20                    (Free, current version available)
 
Due to the code winning PCMag's Editor's Choice, my own BBS has been
extra busy of late (averaging 26 seconds between calls!).  As such,
I'm happy to send the first 100 VIRUS-L readers sending me a letter
mentioning VIRUS-L, along with all their appropriate reach information
(name, address, etc) a copy of the code @ no charge.
 
It's shareware, so even if you opt to not register it, feel free to
pass it around to others.  I'd prefer that you [eventually] register
it, of course, and at least let me know what your comments and
suggestions for the next version might be.
 
My turnaround time is getting pretty good, averaging three days.
Here's my address:
      Ross M. Greenberg
      Software Concepts Design
      594 Third Avenue
      New York, New York  10016
 
(For those who do get through to my BBS (at 2400/1200/N/8/1), hit a
return, then stick in some sort of unique handle and password until
you get a "Welcome New User" message.  Then pop over to [A]rea 2 and
download FSP_152.ARC.  )

[Ed. The above message went back and forth between Ross and myself a
couple of times...  I didn't want for it to be a commercial
advertisement.  I hope that it's toned down enough now that it can be
read as a notice of availability, and nothing more.
 
How about someone sending in an independent, objective review of this
latest version of Flu_Shot+?]

Another inaccuracy in the book is in the way it treats the Hebrew
University case. The authors of the book went for the theory that the
virus as politically motivated. They use the case as an example of how
viruses can be used by terrorists. I checked for the references the
authors used for the case, the bibliography gives only one specific
reference. (Also the designation used for this virus case was "the PLO
virus" which further emphasizes the political origins claim.)
 
It was the treatment of this case that made me look at the book more
carefully.

Subject: Powering down before using a micro
 
Many articles on virus prevention reccomend turning off a micro before
using it.  If the micro has a hard disk, what good does this do?
