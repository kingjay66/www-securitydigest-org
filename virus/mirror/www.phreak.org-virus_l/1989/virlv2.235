VIRUS-L Digest   Wednesday,  8 Nov 1989    Volume 2 : Issue 235

VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

In Virus-L V2 #234, <polari!robert@beaver.cs.washington.edu>,
robert@polari.UUCP (robert)
[Robert Riebman] speculates that Robert Woodhead's Virex application
takes a more conservative approach than Interferon, and does not worry
about identifying new viruses, under the generic term "Sneak".

While I do no use Virex, it is my understanding that it does try the
same trick as Interferon, and identify suspicious code as a "sneak"
virus.

As also stated previously, there is no virus known as "sneak" per se.
This is a term Woodhead alone uses to discuess new viruses that his
applications are not familiar with.

and goes on to give examples of some nasty things that future
viruses/worms might do.  His item is interesting and welcome;
I'm not clear, though, in what sense it's a reply to mine, or
what the "sigh" means.   In the posting that Mr. Frost is
quoting from, I was just replying to the original assertion
that current tools would not be able to detect a virus that
bypassed the operating system to talk directly to the hardware,
by pointing out that one class of tool that's common today
would not be fooled by that approach.  I certainly didn't
mean to suggest that there aren't *other* clever things
that viruses could do, but haven't yet done.

Subject: Found This On My System

There is a file going around called either NORTSTOP.ZIP or NORTSHOT.ZIP
which, by it's (sparse) documentation and the copyright inside the EXE
file, claims to be from Norton Computing.  Because of the sparse and
unprofessionally presented docs, I looked within the EXE file and found:

  The Norton Public Domain Virus Utility,  PD Edition 5.50,  (C)1989

     Your System has been infected with a Christmas virus!  Selected
     files were just eliminated!  Without these files, you might as well
     use your computer as a damn, boat anchor!  If you do NOT own a
     boat, you may want to replace the files which were just erased.
     Try to determine which files they were.  HARDY  HA! HA! HA! HOW DO

I spoke with Craig and Tony from Norton Computing and it sure ain't

either SCANV simply can't recognize it, or it's a prank, but either way,
it has no business being in circulation.  Be on the look out!

     To: ALL
   From: TONY MCNAMARA
   Subj: Trojan Horse

    We at Peter Norton Computing would like to bring to your attention
an unauthorized trojan horse named NortStop.ZIP or NortShot.ZIP (these
files are the same).  This file was NOT produced with the knowledge or
permission of PNCI.

    This file is not a virus (it does not infect files).  Instead, it
is a trojan horse (it must be run explicitly to cause any damage).
When run, it lists the directory and claims the system is virus-free.
Between December 24th and December 31st, however, it will erase files
in several directories based on their extensions.

    These files can be recognized by their sizes (NortStop.ZIP is
31744 bytes, NortStop.EXE is 38907 bytes), or by doing a text search
for the strings "NORTSHOT.EXE" in the ZIP, "Norton Public" in the EXE.

    If you find or hear of these files, please contact us immediately
through Tony McNamara, 213/319-2076 (voice), TMCNAMARA 381-9188 (MCI),
or CompuServe (72477,2504).

    Again, these files are in no way associated with PNCI.  Please
help us track down and eliminate these files.

    Thank you,

        Peter Norton

Subject: Previously reported BootChek problems (PC)

Regarding a previous couple of postings about problems with BootChek,
it appears that the problem is not a bug.  Evidently, Jeff has indeed
been hit by a virus or system problem of some kind.  After re-SYSing
the hard drive (from a clean system), and reinstalling BootChek, Jeff
says things are back to normal.  Since from the information I've obtained,
it doesn't seem to be bug-related, we (McConachie Associates--sorry John,
but it does have a ring to it) are looking at the other possibilities
(maybe a virus? or a system quirk?).  More info to come later.

I perhaps jumped the gun crying "bug", but hey, my experience as a programmer
has taught me to there is only one valid assumption about computing:
It's my fault.  Murphy's Law works in strange ways...

Subject: Re: Virus source available in Toronto

Sorry about the fact you got hurt personally out there in the
hinterlands...  I should have classified my statement even further...
the published "CURRENT" sources are not really that much of a threat
to a person experienced in counter- measures against viruses(READ Safe
Computing Practices...) and like it or not until more effective
protection is put into the silicon itself.. the watchword of the
future is be prepared carry computer condoms!!While any virus can be
deadly to the unprepared every one of the current day viruses that the
CVIA and other organizations and individuals has had the chance to
analysize... has been of the short fuse variety... this makes them
relatively easy to detect...  much greater damage can be done to the
security of an organization or a country by using viral techniques to
put covert data channels into place... these and other tricks will be
the next generation of virii...as far as the present day ... we will
always see relatively primitive virii being produced from published
\sources... as the publication usually lags the industry by as much as
several months it gives vendors who are in tune to this problem
several man months of r+d Time for new nostrums... I agree that while
some damage is done by sources but robert morrises type doesnt work
from published sources...  they usually have the skills necessary to
bypass that!!About the only sophisticated technique i have seen was in
traceback....all else was just standard dos/bios System programming
skills needed to implement...the biggest leg up to a budding virii
developer are the tsr programming packs with source and various
articles and tools on reverse code engineering...so sorry to poke
holes in your favorite theorys but we havent seen or detected any more
than annoyance viruses from published sources ghost viruses not
withstanding...(again I will reiterate for the computer \user
unwilling to make the commitment in time and energy to become
knowledgeable about safe computer practices these viruses can indeed
be deadly but enough sources have been released at this point that the
genie really cant be put back in the bottle(I too wish it hadnt
happened... but it did and now we have to learn to live with and treat
the problem... just like aids in the bay area... one is either
knowledgeable or one will be eventually dead!!) same for computers one
will either be knowledgeable or...  some idiot there will release a
virus and throw ones data in the bit bucket...  As far as the
unsophisticated user who wants to protect well thats what CVIA is
there for...
           cheers
           kelly
p.s. sorry guy but I dont take a hand wringing approach to the problem
of published sources...mostly every thing I have seen so far is on a
relatively primitive level... i.e. no 1-way decryption... no shadow
allocation systems...  no memory residence being done by techniques
which totally bypass dos and any existing antiviral products...no PSP
backtracing and use of obsolete ways into dos!!in other words nothing
much more than present day leading edge tools can protect against!!it
could easily be a far far worse situation if various government
"black" organiztions and/or terrorists and/or Corporate IE (Industrial
Espionage) types were to fund underground virus developement for
unknown neferious goals ....

Jesus you mean someone else out there can think for himself...as far

is) I work locally here in Silly-Con valley as a Network nerd and
various wizard on\ a extremely broad swath of tech areas... anti-viral
lab work is a VERY large part of that... I am running 386/pcdos only
in protected mode with several layers of antiviral products... my
write lines on my drive interfaces have to be explicitly and manually
enabled...VM/8086 partitions are used to block direct access to REAL

No, what you are describing is the infamous Interferon Anomaly 104.
The infection strategy I described as ``sneak'' was changing the
type of a common System folder file to INIT.  This check was too
rigorous and gave false positives when System 6.0 came out because
in 6.0 some of the file types changed.

You are right : there is no such thing as SNEAK.  And Interferon is
obsolete now; use Disinfectant or (plug, plug) Virex.

Subject: Computer Viruses Attack China

     Ministry of Public Safety of People's Republic of China found this
summer that one tenth of the computers in China had been contaminated by
three types of computer virus:  "Small Ball", "Marijuana" and "Shell", China
Daily reported.  The most serious damage was found in the National
Statistical System, in which "Small Ball" spread in 21 provinces.
In Wuhan University, viruses were found in *ALL* personal computers.
     In China, three hundred thousand computers (including PC's) are
in operation.  Due to premature law system the reproduction of
software is not regulated, so that computer viruses can easily be
propagated.  Ministry of Public Safety now provides "vaccines" against
them.  Fortunately, those viruses did not give fatal damage to data.

First Virus Attack on Macs in Japan

     Six Macs in University of Tokyo, Japan, were found to have caught
viruses, newspapers and radio reported.  Since this September, Prof. K. Tamaki,
Ocean Research Institute, University of Tokyo, has noticed malfunctions on the
screen.  In October, he applied vaccines "Interferon" and "Virus Clinic" to
find his four Mac's were contaminated by computer viruses, "N Virus" type A and
type B.  He then found ten softwares were also infected by viruses.  A Mac of
J. Kasahara, Earthquake Research Institute, University of Tokyo, was also found
to be contaminated by N Virus and Score Virus.  Those are the first reports of
real viruses in Japan.

     Later it was reported that four Mac's in Geological Survey of Japan, in
Tsukuba, were infected by N Virus Type A.  This virus was sent from U. S.
together with an editor.
