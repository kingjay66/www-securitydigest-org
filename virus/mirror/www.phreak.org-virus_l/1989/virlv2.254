VIRUS-L Digest   Wednesday,  6 Dec 1989    Volume 2 : Issue 254

VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

Can anyone tell me what the symptoms/effects of nVir A and B are?  I
have an infection here, but no apparent damage.

tnx,

Subject: VIRUSCAN Versions (PC)

A reader asked the current version of Viruscan.  There was at least
version 50 as of Friday, 1 Dec.  Version 49 available on Simtel20 does
search for 51 known MS-DOS viruses, including variants.  Perhaps BBS
administrators chose to label Version 49 as "51" for this reason.

Also, I have used Data Physician, a commercial set of programs for
MS-DOS virus protection for several years.  I noticed that a recent
upgrade contained a "Beta Test" version of a program called "VirScan".
As the name implies, the program provides a similar function as
Viruscan.  I ran Viruscan, Version 49, against the program and
Viruscan alarmed on the presence of the Jerusalem virus, Version B and
the Cascade virus (1701).  Since I subsequently saw no infection
action, it is my belief that this was a "false" positive.  I have
notified the vendor, Digital Dispatch, Inc., of the occurrence.  Has
anyone else encountered a similar experience?

Is it possible to undo the effects of the Jerusalem-B so that stricken
EXE and COM files can be safely used?  Thanks...

Subject: Request for virus info (PC)

  WE HAVE THE 'BRAIN' AND THE 'PING-PONG' STRAINS IN OUR PC LABS.
PLEASE FORWARD ANY INFORMATION ON THESE TWO STRAINS OF VIRUS.
DO YOU KNOW ANYONE WHO MIGHT HAVE A GOOD SOFTWARE TO DISINFECT OUR
PC LABS?  I HAVE SOME INFORMATION ON SOFTWARE THAT MIGHT
DISINFECT PC/XT, BUT WOULD LIKE TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THIS
PROBLEM FROM ANYONE WHO MIGHT HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE WITH IT.
I HEARD THE 'SCANV47' SOFTWARE IS NOT QUITE EFFECTIVE AGAINST
THE '(C) BRAIN' VIRUS, BUT IT KILLS THE 'PING-PONG' VIRUS.
IF YOU HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE IN DEALING WITH PC VIRUS PROBLEMS, MY
QUESTION TO YOU IS, WHAT CAN A SOFTWARE DO TO PREVENT VIRUS PROBLEMS
IN AN OPEN PC LAB WHERE THERE IS NO PHYSICALLY CONTROLLED ACCESS
TO THE PC/XT MACHINES?...PERHAPS, NOT MUCH!

  ANY SUGGESTIONS FROM YOU ON HOW TO MANAGE VIRUS PROBLEMS IN
A PC LAB WITH NO PHYSICALLY CONTROLLED ACCESS WILL BE APPRECIATED.

  THANK YOU.

Subject: Information on Mac Viruses

I am trying to compile a file with information pertaining to
mischievious programs running on a Mac.  I have Disinfectant
documentation and that is very helpful and useful.  (Thank you very
much John Norstad et al.)  However I would like as much information as
possible for my files.  Any info or comments are appreciated and you
can find me at the address (either e-mail or US MAIL below).  Thank
you very much.

Subject: New VirusX v4.0 is out and the BGS-9 virus (AMIGA)

        The BGS-9 virus is real and out there.  I just got the newest
VirusX program from Steve Tibbett and ran it on my system.  It found
the BGS-9 virus on my workbench disk, my backup copy of my workbench
disk and two other disks.  I had a few friends also find it on their
disks.  The virus seems to inflict damage on the first executable file
in your startup sequence.  It infests itself in it and moves part of
the original code to df0:devs/.  The file shows up there without a
filename (or it is masked somehow).  VirusX v4.0 is out and will
find/kill that virus.  It can be had on compuserve and is showing up
on many of the Amiga BBS's throughout the country.  Better check your
system, it may be infected.

Yes. I have received and analyzed an application infected with this
virus. It is another nVIR B clone. MacMASH has been very active these
days to update the existing anti-virus tools. The results so far: -
Disinfectant 1.3, who now correctly detects and removes this strain -
SAM 1.2 (idem)

Trap watchers like Vaccine and GateKeeper don't neet to be updated for
this new strain. Some disk browsers like Antipan 1.3 already detect
all nVIR B clones, and therefore don't need to be updated either.

Subject: Strange Video Problems? virus? (PC)

I'm having some very strange problems with my video output on both my
home computer system and my universities PS/2's.  My home system is an
XT clone (V20-10, Phoenix bios), and the PS/2's I've noticed it on are
55SX's that are networked with Novell.  Both systems have monochrome
video, mine with a hercules clone and Samsung flat screen and the
PS/2's with some card and I think 8513 mono monitor.

My problem is that starting about column 12 or so, to column 30 or so,
the characters and such in that reagion (any row), jump up about 5 or
10 lines and stay there.  This reeks havoc as far as command lines and
such.

I first noticed this in Telix, my terminal program.  It has done it
without fail everytime in Telix since, sometimes when not even
connected.  The s screen just looks garbled.  It usually takes about
10 minutes for it to happen.  This was on my home machine.  I have
also noticed it using my editor, Multi-Edit v4.00.  I could just PgUp
then PgDn in ME and it would be fixed, same with Q Edit, but I can't
do anything about it in Telix, not even clearing the screen fixes it.
I then started using ZComm instead of Telix, but it did wierd things
there too, mostly just a specific graphic block character was
interspersed between things and the screen was a little out of order.
Later I began getting Internal stack errors and messages such as this,
but I think that was due to my disk cache (which I remedied by adding
stack space - I think).  Anyway, I started to use the Engineering
Centers' computers instead of mine.  Just today my editor did the same
trick, that specific section/column of the screen jumped.  Until
today, I thought I had a memory chip gone bad or something, but why
would it do it on the PS/2's also?  My only clue now is that it's some
type of virus or something.  But I doubt that.  My command com is
fine, and the floppy I'm using at the EC doens't have Command.COM on
it, and I've copied my backup of Telix over mine and it still has the
same problem.  As for my system and the floppy, the only thing they
have in common as far as files go (it's a 1.44MB 3.5") is about 10
Turbo Pascal source code files, and their respective compiled version
and my editor - Multi Edit.  I had been using Multi-Edit for about 3
months before this happened, so I doubt it's the problem.  I have also
had problems with Turbo Pascal environment on my system, but I don't
use it, I just use the command line compiler, and the same goes with
the engineering center.  I haven't even compiled code on my system for
about 2-3 weeks and I still have my problem.

Any ideas????  Any programs I can use to test my system?  The only
think that comes to mind is a worm or logic bomb type of thing.  I saw
them do a "viruscan" at the engineering center about 3 or so weeks
ago.  Help anyone...

I forgot to say, when I exit telix, then re run it, the screen is
still messed up.  However, if I reboot my system the screen is ok the
next time I run Telix.  As for the editors, to get rid of it, all I
have to do is the PgUp, PgDn sequence, no reboot is necessary.  Thanx.

Subject: Viruses which infect LAN

I am doing some research on viruses which are capable of infecting LAN
and I am looking into area such as :

- - how normally viruses get into a LAN
- - how these viruses spread
- - can viruses such as Jerusalem, Ping-pong, Stoned which infect stand-
  alone PC infect LAN server as well
- - will the server be infected if a network user who after established a
  link with the server, run an infected program from his harddisk

I'll be very much appreciate if someone out there who have the info or
experience dealing with virus in a LAN environment share some(if not
all) of the info/experience with me. You can send the info to this
list (if you think it will be of interest to the list readers) or you
can send direct to me at CCEYEOYT@NUSVM.BITNET

Thanks in advance for all your help.
