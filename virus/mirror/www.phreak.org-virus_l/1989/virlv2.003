"A question of relevance to this discussion is along the following
lines.  Is it not the ethical responsibility of our government to
establish laws and guidelines which software must pass before being
distributed."

Bite your tongue!  Murray's first law of data security reads: "Be very
careful what you ask for; you might get it."

No body promised you a rose garden.  If you got it, you would likely
find it to be a cold and hungry place.  Those who believe that it is
the responsibility of government to provide us with a zero-risk world
would do well to think about the implications.  God protect me from
computer software provided by those wonderful people who who gave us
the Nuclear Regulatory Agency.

Subject: Bursting Digests on UNIX hosts

From time to time, the subject of mail digests comes up, as it does
often with BIG-LAN Digest.  Some folks, such as I, do not like to have
to read through the entire digest to get msgs of interest.
Fortunately, if you use MH-Mail (RAND's Mail Handling utility on UNIX
hosts), you can place the MH command "inc" (incorporate mail from the
system mail box into my inbox) in your login script, followed by the
command:

	burst `pick -subj "VIRUS-L Digest"` >& /dev/null

This looks for msgs with VIRUS-L Digest in the subject field and
bursts them into their constituent msgs.  Then, you can scan a message
list which identifies each component of the digest individually.

For those of you on UNIX machines who do not have MH (public domain),
consider kicking and screaming for it!

Regards to all,
