VIRUS-L Digest   Thursday,  7 Dec 1989    Volume 2 : Issue 255

VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: Differences... (PC)

The question "How many different PC viruses are known ?" is a hard one.
The two main reasons why it is so:

1) Some viruses have been reported, but not made available for research,
   so nobody has been able to compare them to existing viruses. In some
   cases there are even doubts that the viruses in question exist at all.
   The viruses in this group are "4096", "Nichols", "Missouri", "Agiplan",
   "Retro" and "Screen".

2) Even when the viruses are available for study, it is often hard to
   determine if two viruses are different or not.

   Consider the following possibilities:

      I Binary identical. No problem here - the viruses are identical.

     II Code is identical on the binary level - text strings changed.
        Some of the variants of "Brain" are a good example.

    III Identical on assembly language level. One example includes viruses
        created by typing in a disassembly and then assembling it, using an
        assembler different from the one originally used. Different
        assemblers will in many cases create different opcodes for the same
        instruction. (the POP/PUSH instructions for example). An example
        is the two variants of the "South African" virus that I have. One
        is an original, the other is created using the disassembly by Jim
        Goodwin.

     IV Minor changes to code, extra NOP instructions added or other changes
        made that have no effects on the function of the virus, but may
        invalidate search strings. The "Lisbon" virus is a good example
        of this.

      V Minor changes to code, different lengths, bug corrections, different
        activation dates and similar changes. Most of the 1701/1704 variants
        fall in this category, but also "Saratoga", "2930","Mix1-B" etc.

     VI Identical replication code, different functions. The "Sunday" virus
        is a good example of this. Also "Ghost", "1704-Format", "Typo" and
        "Advent".

    VII Partially identical code - very different functions. "Fu Manchu"
        is the best example.

   VIII Different code - identical functions. Example: The "ping-pong"
        effect in the MIX-1 virus.

     IX Different code, Functionally identical replication and/or infection
        mechanism. Different functions. No problem - different viruses.

So, what do we do ?  We need to define when we consider two viruses to be...

        ...different viruses
        ...different strains of the same virus
        ...not to be considered different

Of course we can proceed from a different angle - select a few identification
strings for each virus and then classify new viruses as follows:

      ... contains all the identfication strings of the old one -> same

      ... contains some of the identification strings -> new variant

      ... contains none of the identification strings -> new virus


Or maybe use this method:

      ... the new virus can be removed by using the same program that was
          used to remove the old one -> identical

      ... only a single constant or two need to be changed to make it
          possible to use the same program to disinfect -> new variant

      ... new disinfection program/routine must be written -> new virus.

My opinion is that those two suggestions are practically useless, since two
different people working on the same virus may not reach the same conclusion.

comments/suggestions ?

From the combination of this and the next quote, I'd guess that he's
trying to execute the .ARC files directly instead of unarcing them
first.

Yeah.  It's the disk label (hidden file, 0 bytes).

Subject: I need a copy of m-jruslm.arc (PC)

I need someone to MAIL me a copy of m-jruslm.arc (avail most ftp
places) because for some reason whenever I download from an ftp site,
and then download it to my machine, these archives don't work.  I'm
not sure whats wrong at this moment.  So if someone could mail me the
Jeruselum/ 1813 virus disinfector I'd really appreciate it!  I need it
soon, have a computer program due tomorrow.

Subject: SCAN Versions (PC)

This is a forward from John McAfee:

        The latest version of SCAN is SCANV50.  While version 51 will be
released on December 10, the currently reported V51, unless a re-numbered
version of an earlier release, is not legitimate.  If anyone has a copy
of this file, please upload it to HomeBase at 408 988 4004.
        On another issue:  Bob Gowan, Erik Sherk and others have inquired
about disinfectors (programs that can remove viruses and repair infected
files) for the various viruses.  The individual disinfectors on HomeBase
(M-JRUSLM for the Jerusalem, M-DAV for Dark Avenger, etc.) have been and
still are available for public download.  These individual disinfectors
exist for the more common viruses, and SCAN version 50 and above contains
a list of each virus and the required shareware disinfector.
       In addition, a program called VIRUS CLEAN is available for emergency
access on HomeBase.  This program disinfects all of the known PC viruses.
It is not a shareware product, but free access is provided for emergency
situations.  For emergency access, call voice at 408 988 3832 for
instructions.

Subject: Strange video - VIRUS SOLVED (PC)

Well, the strange video problems I was having were on account of the
1813 or Jeruselem (A I think) virus.  I was able to remedy it by
deleteing all the infected files and replacing them with safe backups.
I used IBM's VIRSCAN program to detect it.  I had been infected in 717
places (about 60 files worth), and some floppies.  I then tried
VIRSCAN on my roommates disks, and found he had the Bouncing Ball
virus!  Sheesh!  OUr network is submerged!  Thanks, I no longer need a
remedy/disinfectant!
