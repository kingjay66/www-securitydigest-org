Subject: several reports available via anonymous FTP

Over the last couple of weeks, I've received several technical reports
from various people.  I'd like to announce their availability.
Currently, they're only available via anonymous FTP from
lll-winken.llnl.gov, but I hope to have them on our LISTSERV shortly,
for BITNET users (FTP is for Internet users only).

Available are:

Coping With Computer Viruses and Related Problems
  by David M. Chess and Steve R. White
     IBM T.J. Watson Research Center
  filename: ibm.paper

Net Hormones: Part 1
Infection Control Assuming Cooperation Among Computers
  by David S. Stodolsky, PhD.
  filename: net.hormones

Virus 101 - Chapters 1,2,3 (would someone please send me chapter 4?)
  by George Woodside
  filenames: virus101.1, virus101.2, virus101.3

These files are all in the ~ftp/virus-l/docs directory on
lll-winken.llnl.gov.

Special thanks to all those who worked on these documents!  Your
efforts are *greatly* appreciated!

Enjoy,

Ken

Subject:    Anti viral software and known viruses

A quick request, as you may know Jim Wright's in the process of trying
to establish a network of co-operating server sites each of which are
prepared to create a directory of anti-viral software for one or
machine types.

Each server site would then share anti-viral software, with regular
notices of newly available software, index lists and note of the
methods of obtaining software being published on the virus lists, and
probably on the comp.sys groups.

Anyhow, now the request, I would be very grateful for details of where
the following anti-viral programs can be obtained, preferably from an
email based server :-

IBM PC

  Cop        command obfuscation processor
  Ice        intrusion countermeasure electronics (Cyberpunk anyone?)
  Ifcrc      CRC checker
  Novirus    file size monitor
  Trojan stop disk request interceptor
  Xficheck   crc and file attribute checker

MAC

  Agar       petri dish for viruses
  Nomad, nVIR weapons, nVIR assassin

Amiga

  clkdoctor, killvirus, sentry, viewboot, protection, tcell

I will be publishing a list of known viruses in mid-April together
with reviews of known protective software, the provisional virus list
now includes 11 IBM PC reported strains:

    Lehigh (2 variants),
	Brain (alias: Lahore, Pakastani; numerous variants),
	Italian (alias: Bouncing Ball, Ping Pong),
	Yale (relationship with Alameda virus to be established)
	Alameda (alias: Merritt)
	Austrian (alias: 648, Vienna),
	New Zealand (alias: Stoned),
	Cascade(alias: second austrian, blackjack, 1701, 1704),
	Friday 13th (alias: 1808, 1813, 1792, Israeli, Hebrew University, PLO,
		sUMsDos; also the sURIV 3.01 variant)
	April 1st (2 strains sURIV 1.01, sURIV 2.01)
	Dbase (based on Ross's recent report, awaiting confirmation)

	Hmm, two basic viruses appearing in Computer viruses: a high
tech disease, plus two other viruses developed as personal projects by
various people and never release (thank goodness!).

For the Mac, 7 strains:
	MacMag (alias: Peace, Drew),
	nVIR   (4 variants: nVIR A, nVIR B, Hpat and AIDS)
	Scores (alias: Vult),
	INIT 29,
	Anti,
	2 hypertext viruses: Dukakis, Hypertext avenger (Don't know
	much about this, only going by one of Alan Solomon's papers)

For the Amiga, 9 strains (including a few anti-virus viruses):
	Swiss crackers association, IRQ, Byte Bandit, Byte Warrior,
	Revenge, Obelisk softworks crew,
	[ North Star, Pentagon Circle, SystemZ - anti-viruses]

For the Atari ST, 11 strains (including 1 anti-virus virus):

	info mainly from George Woodside's virus killer program,
	Anti, Blot, Freeze, Mad, Screen, Key, ACA, Anti, Mouse inverter

	and from the Virus destruction utility:
	Milzbrand link virus

	also known to exist a family of viruses produced by the Virus
	construction set available at a recent German computer fair.

For the Atari 8 bit series:
	1 alleged virus (no details as of yet)

For the Apple II system, 4 strains:
	Elk cloner, festering hate, Cyberaids and Zlink

For a grand total of 44 discernable strains which are (or in some
extinct cases wer)e in circulation, I guess with about 57 if you count
variants as separate viruses. A list of this kind by its very nature
cannot be comprehensive, but I would be exceptionally grateful for
information on any viruses which do not appear on the above list, and
on any aliases you use for the above viruses which I have not cited.

And PLEASE, PLEASE how about some consensus regarding the terms used
to name viruses (especially IBM PC), the proliferation of aliases does
no-one any good and just serves to muddy the water. So far we have
named viruses by characteristic growth in file length, transient
memory usage, strings found in code, originating country, major
infections, resources added, obvious screen symptoms, oh and alleged
writer!

Oh, thanks to Y.Radai for the corrections on my report about the April
1st strains. Hopefully, it won't be quite as prolific as the Friday
13th.

It is my intention to disassemble a number of the more common viral
strains in the near furture to cross-check the reports published on virus-l,
comp.sys groups et al. The next list will include a classification of each
virus by its mode of operation, brief description of symptoms and available
disinfection software. Anyone else compiling a similar list please get in
touch so we can arrange to pool information, any reports of infections by
viruses not appearing on the above list would be of particular interest.

PS.Any more news about the so called Russian virus?

Original-Subject: Re: Virus warning

The supposed bugs in ARCMASTER version 4xx and higher do not exist. If
people would bother to read the doc files they would have learned that
the directory that you specify for it to use to unarc and arc files to
MUST be a special blank directory, since it will erase the entire
contents of the directory after it finishes rearchiving the file. If
you didn't bother to read the docs you might specify your root
directory to use for this function and after ARCMASTER was done, it
would automatically erase all files in that directory.
