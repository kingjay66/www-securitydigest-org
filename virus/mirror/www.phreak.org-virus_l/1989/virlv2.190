VIRUS-L Digest   Tuesday, 12 Sep 1989    Volume 2 : Issue 190

VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

I'm sure a lot of people have !!!

Ditto!

For completeness of thought please do not forget MERVs and
CLUSTER bombs.  How about one of these self extracting archives
that goes and executes the extracted bugs until it's killed ??

Subject: Need help (PC virus)

What's an honest programmer to do?

At my office today, we discovered that we're the proud receivers of a
bloody virus.  It causes an exe file to expand exactly 1808 bytes
every time the exe is run.

We're not familiar with the virus vaccines (if any) out for the IBM.
Can someone suggest anything?

  Manfred Pfluegl asks:

>the answer?

  Well, the answer is just what one would expect: it was first re-
ported in Vienna!  That was in Dec 1987 (or perhaps slightly earlier).
In April 88 the same virus (or a slight mutation of it) was reported
in Moscow, and in Aug 88 it appeared at a summer camp run by Unesco.
Someone who didn't know of its prior existence in Austria gave it the
name DOS-62, presumably because its method of indicating an already
infected file is to set the seconds field of the time entry of the
file to 62.

  I'd like to add one point that was apparently not mentioned by
anyone who replied to Kim's question about the foulup which occurs on
switching diskettes between an "Abort, Retry ..." message and pressing
of the R(etry).  This bug has apparently been removed in DOS 4 by the
inclusion of a Volume Serial Number which is written into the boot
sector (bytes 27h-2Ah) by FORMAT.  (This is a random number based on
the date and time when FORMAT was performed.)  Before allowing the
operation to be retried, the critical-error handler checks this number
on the diskette.  If it does not match, you get the message "Invalid
disk change".

    I think I seen a notice that ssyx archive-server is

Subject: October 12th Virus (PC)

Thought the following note posted to the HomeBase board from John McAfee
might be of interest:

9-11-89 10:38:15
From: John McAfee
Subj: October 12th Virus

    The press has recently focused on the October 12th (DataCrime)
virus as the latest threat to our collective well-being.  The mania
started, I believe, with Joe Hirst's warning in the advertising flyer
for the Virus Bulletin, and was recently fueled by John Dvorak's
August column in the San Francisco Chronicle.  This virus, however, is
a virtual phantom.  It does exist, but it is not a major statistical
threat to U.S. computers (at least not for the next few months).
There have been fewer than 50 reports of infection in Europe and only
seven reports here in the U.S. -- including the Tom Patterson Report
fron Centel - since the beginning of the year.  This compares with
over 30 reports per day of the Jerusalem-B virus, and over ten reports
per day of the 1701/4 virus.
    These statistics come from the VIRUSCAN reports.  The program
distribution, through the FIDONET network, shareware distributors and
other channels has reached an estimated 3 million users.  This is a
large enough statistical base to catch any widespread infection threat
- - and the DataCrime simply has not shown up as a major player.  I
think we would be wiser warning users of the threats that are
statistically most likely.  The current order of appearance is:

    Jerusalem-B         - 62%
    1701/4              - 17%
    Ping Pong           - 9%
    Stoned              - 8%
    All Others Combined - 4%

    These figures are for the past 30 days.  They do change
dramatically from month to month, but the top four are fairly
constant.  The up and coming virus to watch, by the way, appears to be
the Vienna virus.  We had no reports at all in the U.S. from January
till June 18th of this year.  Then one report on the 19th of June, 4
reports through the end of July, 11 in the month of August and 15 in
the first ten days of September.

    Hope this provides some perspective.
