                   Combatting Computer Viruses
                   ---------------------------
 
There will a one day conference (sponsored by PC Business world) held on
the 17th May 1989, in the City conference centre, London.
 
The agenda for the conference is enclosed:
 
0930   What is today's computer virus
       Jim Bates, Consultant Programmer, Bates Associates
       Introductory session, characteristics of viruses,
       demonstration of live viruses (Italian, Brain, New Zealand)
 
1030   The networking perspective
       Mark Gibbs, Manager, Corporate marketing, Novell Inc
       Network virus propogation. Management and technical measures
       to prevent propogation.
 
1150   The legal position,
       Jeffrey Chapman, consultant to the Law commission
       Existing and propsed legislation. Actions to recoupe damages.
 
1400   Keeping out the virus - The US experience
       Ross Greenberg, owner software concepts design
       Management procedures and software used in prevention of viruses
 
1505   How paranoid do you want to be?
       Alan Solomon, Chairman IBM PC user group.
       Personal prospective on virus control, including emphasis on
       an organisation awareness of the dangers. Supportive case studies.
 
1600   Virus forum
 
The conference package includes distribution of disks with anti-viral
software. The price is 235 pounds + vat. Enquiries to:
 
Jenny Mann, Quadrilect,
46 Gray's Inn Road, London WC1X 8PP
Telephone 01-242-4141
Fax       01-404-0258
 
The conference seems from their program to be aimed primarily at business
and corporate users, with limited experience of systems programming or
virus prevention.
 
If I can afford to attend (!) I will be writting a review for comp.virus
of the conference, and of the available protective software.

Subject: Yale and 1701/1704 virus, and Sentry (PC)
 
There seems to be some confusion about whether the Alameda/Yale virus
can infect ATs or other 286 systems.  I worked on the original Alameda
College infection and the virus at that time was unable to work on any
286 system.  The reason is that it contained an invalid 286
instruction (POP CS), which is not a legal op code.  A 286 will
normally hang up if this op code is in the executable file.  Two
months after the Alameda infection, though, a new strain showed up
that was able to infect 286 systems, using a different relocation
technique.  This newer strain is identical in every respect to the
original strain, with this single exception.
 
Also, there seemed to be some confusion about the difference between
the 1701 and 1704 viruses.  Mr. David Chess stated that the 1704 virus
could not successfully avoid infecting IBM systems, and that he had
tested that aspect himself.  If that is the case, then he has tested
the 1701 virus, not the 1704 virus.  The 1701 is the precursor to the
1704.  It had a bug in the BIOS check routine, and infected IBM
systems anyway.  The1704 is three bytes longer and has been verified
by dozens of sites to successfully avoid infecting IBM systems.  Mr.
Goodwin's decompilations of the two viruses points out these
differences.
 
Finally, I would like to comment on Mr. David Bader's remarks about
the Sentry program.  I have been using various versions of Sentry for
almost a year and I couldn't ask for better protection.  It's clear
that Mr. Bader has had limited exposure to live viruses.  Anyone who
has worked with a broad range of viruses could not arrive a the
conclusions he stated.

A friend of mine saw dmg@mwunix.mitre.org's message on the above
subject and had the following comment in response to it.  I thought it
was appropriate for the list.
 
>His checksum might be harder to fake, but it is not necessary to be able
>to reverse the encryption to fake a checksum.  Only the algorithm for
>the forward encryption is needed, and that can be pulled from the
>program that does the checking.  If f is the checksum and g is the
>encryption, all he has done is create a new function s(x) = f(g(x))
>which is just another signature function.  If f was more than just
>a CRC polynomial, g might not really make any difference, and if
>f is a CRC, then some choices of g could make the combination easier
>to break.

Hey folks!  I guess I forgot to mention that I have to get those
requests for the freebie FLU_SHOT's in writing!  I know it sounds
horrid and all that, but my fufillment stuff requires paper copies
(boo! hiss! old technolgy!)
 
Here's my paper address again for those of you who need it:
   Ross M. Greenberg
   Software Concpets Design
   594 Third Avenue
   New York, New York 10016
 
Thanks!
 
Ross
