VIRUS-L Digest   Tuesday, 26 Sep 1989    Volume 2 : Issue 204

VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

It seems like just yesterday that I took a vacation and VIRUS-L was
down for a week...  Well, it's going to happen again.  This time I'll
be in Hawaii for two weeks on my honeymoon, far away from any computer
and very much out of SkyPager range.  I'll be leaving Friday, October
6 and returning on Monday, October 23.  During this time, no VIRUS-L
digests or comp.virus articles will be distributed.  However, feel
free to send in messages for subsequent posting upon my return.  Also,
VALERT-L will remain active and (as always) unmoderated, but is to be
used for VIRUS WARNINGS ONLY (violators will face my wrath when I get
back :-).

Also as always, the CERT can be contacted via cert@SEI.CMU.EDU or
(412) 268-7090 (24 hour hotline) for Internet security issues.

Sorry about any inconvenience.  Things will return to their normal
(hectic) pace when I get back.

Subject: Re: Good viruses?

A good virus is an oxymoron.  All a potential attacker would do is
take the infector code and transplant a logic-bomb or time-bomb code
to it.

This does raise an interesting question though for health checks.
Suppose a company has stringent rules about protecting desktop
computers from viruses.  How do you go about ensuring the rules are
being followed?  One thought I had was the user of "Tiger Teams".

What this Tiger Team would do is work at night and attempt to infect
some of the corporation's desktop computers with a "benign" virus (one
that produces a warning message, but takes no malicous action, akin to
the MacMag virus).  The Tiger Team would operate under strict
supervision, and a computer that was successfully penetrated would be
"quarantined" until the following day.

The next day, the user would get a visit from the Computer Center
folks and get a nice (or not so nice; depending on how often in the
past the user had been successfully "attacked" by the Tiger Team)
lecture on anti-virus methods.

Obviously, the virus would have to be carefully controlled.  The disks
would have to be kept under lock and key when not in use, and under
supervision when in use.

Comments?

Subject: New versions of scanv and scanres (PC)

Recent updates, hot off the presses!

scanv38.arc
        Update to replace previous versions of viruscan.  Note that the
        documentation has an incorrect version number in it.  This is
        how the archive was released.  (The updates have been fast and
        furious, so it's understandable.)  Also note that the size of
        the executable is larger than what John McAfee promised it would
        always be.  I guess when he said "always", he didn't forsee
        the number of revisions of the program he'd be releasing.
        Executable is version 0.5v38.
scanres8.arc
        Update to replace previous versions of scanres.  It is possible
        that the previous version I sent was identical to an even more
        previous version I sent.  In any case, this one's NEW.  :-)
        Again, note that the docs and the program disagree on version
        number.  Executable is version 0.8v38.

SCANV38.ARC     Scans hard drives and reports viruses found.
SCANRES8.ARC    Resident program scans progs for viruses before executing.

Original-From:         Sanjay Hiranandani <GDO@CRNLVAX5.BITNET>

On Friday morning at 8:00 AM, I came into the Sibley facility, sat
down at IBM #18, and invoked Foxbase.  Instead of the familiar welcome
screen, the machine hung.  Other pieces of software throughout in the
facility had recently quit working for no apparent reason.  Gregg said
"I think there might be a virus here," (or words to that effect); from
that time to now, Gregg and I have spent most of our waking hours
trying to figure this out.  This comes at a specially bad time for
Gregg because he's in the middle of training new operators and so on.

    Here is a brief summary of what is now known about the virus:

    1.  Approximately seven of the Sibley facility's IBM PS/2's have
been found to be infected with a highly contagious IBM virus "time
bomb".  Gregg and I have developed a reliable test for the program and
will soon complete its eradication from the facility.  Some users'
personal applications and disks, however, are probably infected.

     2.  The DMPC program (disk manager) which is intended to restrict
users from copying or deleting our software, is effective in
protecting programs from being corrupted -- but only for those
programs for which DMPC has been properly configured to monitor.

     3.  The virus rewrites *.EXE and *.COM files with many changes
including the virus code itself.  In most cases, these changes are
tolerated by the program and it continues to work.  In the case of Word
Perfect (WP.EXE) and Foxbase (FOXPLUS.EXE), the changes make the program
completely nonfunctional.  In other programs, small difference are
noticed: small rectangles of the screen display may get misplaced, for
example.

     4.  An infected *.EXE file can be recognized by the hex string
10078419C5, a five byte string which apparently takes over the 21st
through 25th bytes near the beginning of the file.  This is not the
only change, but it is a consistent one.  Infected copies of WP.EXE,
FOXPLUS.EXE, APL.EXE, ED.EXE, NU.EXE, etc., etc., all had this same
string in the exact same location.  No uninfected software had this
string anywhere.  Uninfected IBM's had no sign of this string anywhere
on their hard disks.

     5.  This same string also occurs in what appears to be the virus
code itself, which is written to the "slack area" of *.EXE files
between the end-of-file and the end of the file's actual allocated
disk space.  Often, maybe always, the end-of-file marker is
overwritten.  Secondly, a certain fixed distance after the occurence
of 10078419C5 is the ascii text "COMMAND.COM", a further clue for
identifying this virus.

     6.  Files modified by the virus show NO SIGN AT ALL of any change
to the DOS directory command.  The number of bytes and the date and time
of last modification are unchanged, when in fact a file is infected.

     7.  When a file is fragmented on the disk, individual fragments may
become separately infected.

     8.  Setting a file's attributes to "read-only" or "hidden" does NOT
protect it.

     9.  Setting the write protect tab on a diskette appears to
protect diskettes in the 3.5" drives at Sibley.  Executing a program
from a locked 3.5" diskette on an infected machine generates a "Write
protect error writing drive A" message.  The program on the diskette
remains uninfected.

     10.  When an infected machine's internal clock-calendar is
changed to register a date of 10-13-89 (Friday the 13th), all *.EXE
and *.COM files will DELETE themselves when a user tries to execute
them (for example, if a user types WP, for WordPerfect, the WP.EXE
file would be deleted, and the message "Bad command or file name"
would be displayed on the screen).  This condition applies when the
system date is 10-13-89, but not 10-12-89 or 10-14-89 (we speculate
that it may apply to every Friday the 13th, but this has not been
tested).  Attempts to execute a program from an unlocked diskette will
cause the deletion of the program, regardless of whether it was
previously infected.  The virus deletes programs in a normal fashion,
and these files are probably recoverable.  Of course, all these
recoverable files are infected anyway, and not really worth recovering
(unless the virus begins to kill data files as well).

     11.  When the system date is 10-13-89, the virus attempts to
delete DMPC-protected software (the warning bleep sounds), but fails.
Such programs continue to work even on machines heavily infected with
non-DMPC protected software.

     12.  After working all day Friday fighting this virus, I spoke
with my girlfriend, who had heard something on National Public Radio
about a virus which becomes active on October 13.  In the meantime,
Gregg heard a rumor about an October 12th virus.  From a friend in
Michigan, I heard about an October 12th virus which supposedly would
attach itself to *.COM files and disable the hard disk by overwriting
track 0.  I don't know whether these other reports are of the same
exact virus (with a few wrong facts), or whether there is some
national "collective action" to write lots of different viruses which
all spring into view on the same day or so.  (I incline toward the
first view, Gregg toward the second).

     Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance in
getting rid of this thing.

I do not contest that the author of a computer application (especially
a copyrighted application) is entitled to set whatever conditions they
want on the use or distribution of their work, and I have stated so
before.  But this is a different issue than whether such an
application qualifies as "Shareware", "Freeware", etc.

Shareware has a specific meaning: software (copyrighted or otherwise)
that is distributed outside of commercial channels, that is paid for
if the user decides to use it.  Freeware is a subset of this; the cost
of a freeware application is zero.  Nowhere in this definition is
there a prohibition of the distribution of copyrighted software!

Any author is welcome to put whatever restrictions they want on their
work, no question about it.  When those restrictions go beyond a
certain point, they author cannot fairly call their work Shareware,
IMO.

This is getting/has gotten outside of the scope of Virus-L.  If
individuals wish to send me e-mail about it, fine.  Otherwise I
consider the subject closed.

Subject: Security procedures on LANs

Here at the University of NC at Greensboro, we have taken the step of
putting all of our network login software on notchless diskettes.
This means that nothing can be writtien to this diskette, and nothing
can be written to the network itself (except to personal account
areas).  So, any viruses that someone brings in are confined to
his/her own diskettes.  It also saves us from the thankless task of
going through everything periodically and erasing files users have
left on our disks!

[Ed. That is the same setup that we used at Lehigh University.  It
seemed to work pretty well but you still have to trust the security of
the network OS (Lehigh uses Novell) and the physical security of the
file servers.  What are other LANned sites doing to address this (on
PCs and on Macs)?]

Not sure I entirely understand this; if the virus infects -only-
123DOS.EXE, how did you get it?  How would it spread?   (Why, that
is, would an infected copy of 123DOS.EXE ever find itself running
with access to an uninfected copy; why would there ever be two
different copies of the file on the same machine?)           DC

No, no!   The DataCrime viruses activate whenever the date is
October 13th -or later-; no Friday-check.   (Sorry to pick on
you, but people keep getting this wrong!   Other points are
well taken.)                     DC

Is it not simpler to back the FAT/boot sectors up to floppy and then
restore them?  You can use Norton Utilities Advanced for that, or a
quick little utility that I will release within a week.

What I would like to know, however is whether just rewriting the boot
and FAT sectors will be sufficient?

subject mentioned, so here goes (with a dumb idea).
Will changeing a file attribute to READ ONLY stop or slow down a virus?
What about write locking a whole Directory?
Does hiding a file or directory have any effect???
I'm guessing that a virus will disregard any attribute settings.
