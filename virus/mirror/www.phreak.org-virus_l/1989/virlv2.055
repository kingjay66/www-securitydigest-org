Due to a quota crunch I had to delete all my mail, both old and new.
Would the person(s) from Sweden who asked me (personally) about public
domain anti-virals please re-send their message, I think yours was one
of the ones that got zapped.

Thanks,
Steve

Vaccine will protect you from nVIR infections. Installing a dummy nVIR
ID=10 in the System file will stop nVIR from spreading into a clean
system (but the system will show up as infected with most detectors).

nVIR follows the two-stage infection technique - an infected
application installs the viral resources into the system. When the
system is rebooted, every application run under that system gets
infected.

There are two different "strains" of nVIR, only slightly different
from each other. Most of the detectors can find both. There is also a
variant called "Hpat" (it has "Hpat" resources instead of "nVIR"
ones).

nVIR actually modifies the subject application. It is recommended that
a detector such as Virus Rx or Interferon be used to find the infected
files, and that these be replaced from locked, known-clean originals.

Disinfectors are available for a "quick fix", but Apple (and I)
recommend replacement.

As you have no doubt seen in VIRUS-L, lots of people are using
checking programs in public labs (at Cornell, they reserve a whole Mac
so that users can check their disks!).  We did not feel that this
approach would give us sufficient protection against new viruses which
were not yet known to the detectors.  Disk washing, though somewhat
tedious, is quite a bit more secure.  Each site, of course, will have
to balance cost against risk for itself.

For those of you who have caught the conversations midstream of any
Macintosh discussion regarding viruses, there are two programs
(copyrighted) that claim that they can eliminate all or most Macintosh
viruses, not to mention, repair any damaged applications.

One that I own and haved tested thoroughly is "Virex", sold by HJC
Software.  They currently offer relief for ALL *KNOWN* Macintosh
viruses including the recently introduced "ANTI" virus.  Current
release is 1.3 and can be purchased at most Apple retail stores that
offer any of Apple's products.  Price is around $40.  Support is good
and they update you for a small fee.  They offer to repair any damaged
application including the Finder, System, and Desktop files.

Hopes this helps those who would like to be rid of nVIR Type B.

P.S.  We ourselves were panicked by a campus-wide epidemic of nVIR Type B.
      Thanks to "Virex", the problem no longer exists.

Hi Folks!

      I bet this has come up so many times, that you are bored stiff
hearing about it.  I am doing a presentation about viruses etc and I
want to make sure I have my facts straight.

Definitions:

Trojan Horse: A program which performs a function (e.g. Game) and
              deposits something nasty somewhere on (say) a hard disk
              to really screw things up.

Worm :        A program that is designed to copy itself and replicate all
              over the place and generally slow systems down, they can
              have nasty features too (e.g. deleting files etc).  The
              Christmas card thingy was a worm.

Virus :       This is something that can 'infect' a disc.  Some code lurks
              somewhere and puts itself on discs that is used on the
              machine.  These discs can in turn infect other machines
              and at some time, random, or time bomb, do something
              nasty.

This is how I see these things at the moment.  I would like some
confirmation about this lot.  Are there any others?  I am not really
interested in machine specific nasties.  What are these things that
infect specific programs though?

Any comments/ideas on things like, what can be done about the little
blighters, or what the programmer responsible thinks he gains from it.
Who does gain (if anybody)?

Please reply to me direct.

Many thanks, you are all life savers!

                                   Steve.

                                    but I'm confident you'll pull through)
