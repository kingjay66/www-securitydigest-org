Subject:  RE: Having hardware check writes to disk.
 
     The suggested solution of having hardware question writes to disk
does not seem to be feasible.  I work a lot with VAX Pascal and it is
common for me to write to files a lot in programs.  This would mean I
would have to sit there and ok every write, highly inefficent.  A
better way would be to question writes to the operating system (I
believe FluShot.com does this) since the way to make a virus most
effective seems to me to be by infecting the operating system, thus
changing what the run command does, thus enabling the virus to spread.
Well, that's all I've got to add to this.

That does sound very much like the sample that I got from Yale, which
I'm pretty sure is the same one that Loren got from Yale, and so is
presumably the one that J.M. says is identical to the Alameda/Merrit.
(Whew!)  Presumably the "first free sector" in the article was a case
of slight oversimplification for the sake of making it fit into the
table?                                        DC

Hello all. We are going to be reorganizing the anti-virals archive
here at SCFVM in the next week or so, to coincide with the rerelease
of my anti-viral doc stack (version 2.0). I will be posting details
when we've finalized them; I will probably be removing anything which
is no longer supported (such as Interferon - since Bob Woodhead is
concentrating on Virex now), or which has been outmoded.

HI there!!
 
    As one of the original discoverers of the Yale virus this summer,
I wish to make one comment in regards to a recent posting (Virus-L, v2
#88, last posting) that claimed that Almeda virus=Yale.  In whoever's
posting of thier summary, there was a statement that this virus did
not work in 80286 machines because of different memory addresses and
the like.  If this is indeed true, than there is no way that the
Almeda virus and the Yale virus can be the same creatures.  All our
public domain machines are IBM ATs, and the virus was transmitted
quite successfully through any number of them.  Indeed, I have no
experience with the virus except on '286 machines.
 
    Could someone more knowledgeable about viruses and internal
differences between 8088 and 80286 machines comment on this?

Subject:      re: general question
 
Bruce Ide suggests that the user could confirm all disk writes.
 
Three immediate problems.
 
1. For every disk write, it would be a pain in the #&*%.  Besides,
users would get very complacent and OK everything without analyzing
what is, should, and should not be written just before the little red
light goes on.
 
2. Inexperienced users would not understand when they should confirm a
write to begin with.
 
3. A virus could:
   a) simulate a "save" so the hardware thinks it is OK
   b) wait for a legitimate save to occur and propagate during that
      operation.
 
I'm sure there are many other arguments against this methodology as
well.  But, Bruce, the more we work on the problem, the closer we get
to a (if this is possible) a solution.  So keep those ideas coming!
