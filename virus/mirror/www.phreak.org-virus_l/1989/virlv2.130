Recently I wrote a message, asking for volunteers to test a new TSR
virus protection program. By now they probably have received the
source code and are testing the program. This program is a part of a
protection package, which will be sent to the anti-viral archives when
finished. (By the way, who are the managers of the various archives ?)
 
Now I have a question:
 
    Does anyone out there know of a package for testing protection
    software ?  If not, would anybody be interested in creating such a
    package ? It would consist of a number of programs, intended to
    test various methods of attack. I have written two such programs,
    one for attacking the boot sector (in 4 basically different ways),
    and the other for attacking .EXE files (using a wide variety of
    methods).
 
I also have a request:
 
    Included in my package is an inoculation program. It is designed
    to fight specific BSV, by writing a few bytes to the boot sector,
    making the diskette look as if it has already been infected.
    Currently the program inoculates against Brain, Ping-Pong and
    Marijuana. I do not have the other known BSV (Yale, Den Zuk and
    Nichols) in my collection, and I would be very grateful if
    somebody could E-Mail me some information on how those viruses
    check if the diskette is already infected.

Hello Everybody:
        At the end of last semester I ran into a recurring "degradation"
in my students' software (dbase iii+) diskettes (maybe 5 of 40).  Things
we so hectic (my first year here), that I just had them go get new copies
(boo).  So I didn't get a copy of the problem disks.  As I started to
recover after finals, I got to thinking...  Here is what we saw.  Whenever
they tried to get a print screen while in dbiii+, the printer went crazy,
started spewing out garbage, and had to be reset (powered down and back)
before the next job could be run.  We were doing joins - might have some-
thing to do with that (but that wouldn't explain the other 35 or so).
        Another wierdness (or maybe not).  If you are (BY THE WAY, WE
ARE TALKING ABOUT IBM CLONES) booting up from a bootable diskette (not a
full DOS disk) with no config.sys file, does it get the files and buffers
limits from the dos disk that originally made the bootable disk?  It
must, obviously.  Where does it keep this stuff?  (I'm digging into dos
and masm this summer, I hope this is not too stupid a question.)  I think
this is unrelated to the above problem - maybe not.
        Finally, I just heard a rumor, myth, . . .  Supposedly,
someone read this somewhere.  Is it possible that the software
packagers are spreading viruses to their competition (for obvious
reasons).  "Hi, I'm a virus, are you a database? Are you my database?
CRUNCH."  Sounds rather strange, but...
 
                                     Thanks people,
                                     L. Anne Cole

>By requiring that the receiving machine be notified of the transfer,

Nonsense.  To use LapLink one must have control over both the Laptop
and the desktop machine.  Indeed, what LapLink is designed to do is to
permit the transfer of data between COOPERATING PCs.  It contains no
risk that a PC can transfer data to a non-cooperating PC.
 
LapLink does contain the capapbility to be bootstrapped from, for
example, a laptop with 3.5" drives, to a desktop with only 5.25"
drives.  This capability permits the laptop owner to use a 5.25"-only
machine in a distant city even if he forgets to carry a copy of
LapLink on 5.25" with him.  However, he must be physically connected
by cable to the target machine.  If yours is the target machine and
the source machine is not connected with your permission, then this
capability is the least of your worries.
 
This bootstrap capability is more analogous to a LOAD than to a virus
or worm.
 
The comparison of this capability to a virus originated with an
overzealous reporter.  It was not news when he wrote it; it is not
news now.  The analogy has destroyed any hope that the authors of the
program might ever have had for their press release.  It has
interfered with their legitimate right to publicize their capability.

Oh no!  Not another case of a "virus" invented by the media!  It was bad
enogh when they decided to call the November Worm a virus...
This prog sounds just like a worm to me.  At least from the description.
But this is nothing new.  The PCU (PC to Unix) software sold by Unisys for
quite a time now has a feature where it automatically sends the C code for
a simple file transfer program to the receiving Unix system, and then
compiles it... nothing new here...
(what was the hooha about doing MODE ?  Didn't make very much sense...)

     Woe to me, HELP HELP!!
Hi there, i have got a problem. last month i got the corewars package
from anyone out there, but i forgot his address. if he hear my scream for help
may i ask him for sending me his address. if anyone else out there know
his location and computer-address, please send it to me. above is my
nickname only. my real name is thomas friedrich.
 
the carewars packege is written by Maz Spork, the DaneBrain from danemarc.
 
thanks to all, who understand my interest,

Subject: Dirty dozen viruses
 
Jim Wright sent me a copy of version 9B of the Dirty Dozen list
(thanks Jim), in this list of IBM PC Trojans there are two entries
flagged as viruses, these are:
 
ARC533.EXE This is a new virus program designed to emulate Sea's ARC
           program. It infects the Command.com.
 
PK35B35.ARC This was supposed to be an update to PKARC file compress
           utility which when used eats you FATS and is or at least
           Rumored to infect other files so it can spread - possible
           VIRUS?
 
Question- has anyone suceeded in verifying that these two Trojan
horses do in fact contain (and initiate) viral code, and if so can
someone arrange to isolate the contained viruses and provide an
analysis for the group.
 
On a side note version 9B is now available from Heriot-Watt
info-server to sites in Europe (not uucp domain), send a message of
the form
 
request: virus
topic: ibmpc.dirty
 
the file is 51K long.
 
[Ed. Jim sent me a copy of the same file - I'll have it available here
shortly.]
