VIRUS-L Digest   Wednesday, 22 Nov 1989    Volume 2 : Issue 247

VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

There would be crashes because it's very common for software that
patches traps to have interdependencies between its patches, i.e. one
patch depends on data discovered and stored for later use by another
patch.  Removing only a portion of such patches will be likely to kill
the machine sooner or later.  Even if you remove *all* patches, the
machine is still in grave danger since the INIT (or whatever did the
patching) may have changed some key characteristics of the machine
already - characteristics that it's patches would have isolated other
software from while they were installed and operating.

Further, restoring traps to their original values is going to remove
all of the patches put in place by the System itself - the patches
that keep that machine running inspite of bugs in the ROMs, etc.
Also, whole portions of the OS and Toolbox will be removed by
restoring traps to their initial values (as taken from the ROM) - this
will kill the machine for sure.  And even if you were to take the
status of the trap table at some point early in the boot phase (after
the key System patches had been made) and restore it much later (just
before the first application is loaded, say) you would still be
removing portions of the OS since the portions related to MultiFinder
are added *after* (not before) all the INITs are loaded.  Again, the
machine dies for sure.

Even if these changes to the trap table are temporary, the same
problems inhere - portions of the OS are fully installed and operating
while other portions have been partially or completely lobotomized by
restoring their trap table entries to some initial value.  Provided
there were no inter- dependencies between routines in the OS (not to
mention the Toolbox) this might not kill the machine immediately (but
it would likely kill it event- ually), but since there *are* such
interdependencies (often matched only in their importance by their
subtlety), the machine is going to die very quickly.

Writing well behaved patches is a black art on the best of days -
writing the sort of un-patching patches discussed here would make that
"black art" look like a carefree romp in the sunlit countryside.  I
don't think such patches could be implemented safely, and I don't
think anyone clever enough to do so would be wasting his time working
on viruses in the first place.

All in all, I don't think the techniques dealt with in this discussion
are significant simply because there are too many reliability and
compatibility problems intrinsically linked to them.

Subject: Any volunteers ? (PC)

For the past four months I have been working on a comprehensive
anti-virus package, capable of detecting/stopping and removing all PC
viruses known.

Well, it is finally finished.

The package will be posted on comp.sys.ibm.pc and made available on
SIMTEL and various anti-virus archives.

Right now I am looking for a few volunteers. The package itself has
been thoroughly tested (I estimate that it is running on 5-6% of the
computers here in Iceland), but I need a bit of help with....

          ... checking that the programs do indeed disinfect all infected
          programs and diskettes. I have verified that it will "cure"
          all the samples I have of the following viruses:

                 Alameda (Yale)
                 Brain
                 Den Zuk/Ohio
                 New-Zealand (Stoned)
                 Pentagon
                 Ping-Pong/Typo
                 Swap (Israeli Boot)
         Alabama
                 April 1.
                 Cascade
                 Dark Avenger
                 DataCrime
         DataCrime II

                 Jerusalem/Sunday
                 Lehigh
                 South African "Friday 13."

         Vacsina
                 Vienna/Lisbon
         Yankee Doodle
         Zero Bug

             but there may be variants floating around that I do not have a
         copy of. If you have a collection of viruses, I would appreciate
         if you could test this.

    ...  Another problem is the manual. It consists of several text files,
         around 65K in size. Since English is not my primary language,
         (and not even my second language, for that matter), I am sure
         there are some serious spelling and grammar errors in the
         documentation. Anybody willing to take a look at that ?

Subject: High Level Language viruses

Most of the viruses we have seen to date seem to be written in
assembly language. However, it is possible to write viruses in a High
Level Language (HLL), and a few such viruses have been reported. The
AIDS virus, written in TURBO Pascal is probably the best known one.

Compared to an assembly language virus, a HLL virus will have the following
"features":

    * It is bigger. The AIDS virus, for example, is around 12K,
      which makes it the biggest virus known.

    * It is more difficult to select good signature strings, since
      most of the code produced by the compiler is probably also
      present in a number of other (legitimate) programs. This makes
      the job of detecting HLL viruses a bit harder.

    * Is is much harder to write a good .EXE file infector in Pascal
      or C than a .COM infector.

    * Just about any programmer could write an usable .COM infector in
      C or Pascal in less than an hour. (I mention C and Pascal because
      they are the most popular languages, but a virus could just as
      easily be written in other languages, Forth, Basic or even APL
      or Cobol. Can anybody imagine what a Cobol or APL virus would
      look like...    ;-)

Subject: Corrections and new details on DataCrime (PC)

  Last month I wrote that whereas the original DataCrime virus per-
forms its damage from Oct 13 to Dec 31, DataCrime II does it from Jan
1 to Oct 12.  David Chess and Alan Solomon both replied that in their
copies of DC II, the dates were the same as for DC I: Oct 13 - Dec 31.
That left two possibilities: either there's a mutation with the date
range modified, or my sources were mistaken.
  One source for the Jan 1 - Oct 12 range was the July/August issue of
the Computer Security Newsletter.  I did not at the time accept this
as necessarily correct.  But when I saw a similar statement in the Sep
issue of the Virus Bulletin by Joe Hirst, who does independent disas-
semblies and who always seemed very accurate and reliable in the past,
I became convinced that this was correct.
  After the differences of opinion, however, Joe admitted that he had
been mistaken and that the date range for DC II was the same as for DC
I even on his copy.  Since there apparently haven't been any further
claims for the pre-Oct 12 dates, I tend to believe that the CSN was
also mistaken.  Of course, one *could* easily modify DC II to activate
on Jan 1 - Oct 12 (or on any other date range), but it makes more
sense for the infection period to be long than for the damage period
to be long.
  Joe also wrote originally that Sundays are excluded from damage by
DC II.  This also turned out to be incorrect, although in this case
the correct behavior is different than for DC I: Mondays are excluded.
Following is the relevant part of the code for each virus (I have
translated the disassembly into a pseudo high-level language; the
variable Hdflag contains 0 if there is no hard disk, 1 if there is):

             DataCrime I
  If current date > Oct 12 then go to Hard-disk test;
  Go to Infection routine;
Hard-disk test:
  If Hdflag not 0 then go to Damage routine;

             DataCrime II
  If current date > Oct 12 then go to Day-of-week test;
  Go to infection routine;
Day-of-week test:
  If day-of-week (0 for Sunday, 1 for Monday, etc.) not = Hdflag
         then go to Hard-disk test;
  Go to Infection routine;
Hard-disk test:
  If Hdflag not 0 then go to Damage routine;

Thus in DC II the damage will be performed only if there is a hard
disk and the date is after Oct 12 *and the day is not a Monday*.

  To summarize, there are (at least) six differences between DC I and
DC II:
                               DataCrime I       DataCrime II
Type of files infected:        COM               COM/EXE
Size increase:                 1168 or 1280      1514
Days excluded from damage:     None              Mondays
Encrypted?                     No                Yes
Files excluded from infection: 7th letter = D    2nd letter = B
Message:                       DATACRIME VIRUS   DATACRIME II VIRUS

  So much for corrections.  Now for some new info on these viruses.
Both of them contain code which low-level formats Track 0 on all heads
from 0 to 8.  The pseudo-code looks like this:

  H := 0;
Loop:
  Format Track 0, Head H;
  If error go to Continue;
  H := H+1;
  If H not = 9 then go to Loop;
Continue:

But what happens in the case of disks having less than 9 heads?  Pre-
viously, it was assumed by many that this would result in an error, so
that the extra heads would be ignored, i.e. the virus would format
only Cylinder 0.  But Joe has discovered by experimentation that in
most cases the number of tracks formatted is actually 9, even if this
goes beyond Cylinder 0.  The explanation is that most BIOSes convert
an invalid head number into the valid equivalent. On a 17-sector/track
disk, this will wipe out 153 sectors, which on most hard disks contain
the partition record, boot sector, both copies of the FAT, the root
directory, and possibly some files.

  Fridrik Skulason reported in Virus-L that he was able to recover
from an attack of DC II by using the Norton Disk Doctor.  This might
seem to contradict the above findings.  However, he rebooted before
the virus had a chance to format very much of the disk.  It seems
likely that if he had not done this, all of Norton's horses wouldn't
have been able to put his disk together again.

  There is a package available from Simtel20, called COLUMBUS, which
is supposed to be of use against the "Columbus Day" [i.e. DC] virus.
It consists of two simple programs, ST0 and RT0.  ST0 saves the con-
tent of a certain portion of the hard disk on a diskette file, and RT0
restores it in case of damage by the virus.  Just which portion is
saved is not very clear from the documentation.  In one place it says
"Track 0", while in another place it says "cylinder zero".  Experiment
shows that ST0 saves Track 0 on Head 0 only, which is of little use
against the DC viruses.  A look at the source code shows that the
author left the possibility of saving all of Cylinder 0 by defining a
certain symbol at compile time, but as we now know, even that isn't
enough.  However, the source code can presumably be modified to save
all 9 tracks damaged by a DC virus by simply replacing "maxhead=0" by
"maxhead=8" in both ST0.C and RT0.C.

  Joe Hirst has written a small resident program to prevent damage by
the DC viruses, or more generally, to halt any program which attempts
to low-level format any part of a hard disk by a call to Int 13h func-
tions 5-7.  It (along with the above clarifications on the extent and
dates of the damage) appears in the Nov issue of the Virus Bulletin.

I have noticed the same problem, with a number of applications (among
them are TinCan and Mac286).  I use SAM Intercept from Symantec, and
it alerts me from time to time that an application is trying to change
itself.  I checked for viruses, using a number of packages (Virex,
Sam, Disinfectant and Virus detective), but found none.

I don't think this is a virus, but I find it disturbing because, like
Joel mentions, this happens even when I only start an application and
then quit out of it, without changing preferences or options that
might need to be saved to disk.

Some programs DO modify themselves while running, the important thing
to remember is that these modifications are usually made to the data
fork of the application.  Most virus detectors look only for attempts
to write to resource forks.  (I don't know about Gatekeeper, perhaps
its author could let us know?)  It still seems strange that other
people were not experiencing the same problems as you, but that
doesn't necessarily mean a virus.  To quote Douglas Adams "DON'T
PANIC", as many others do.  Here are some things you can check:

        1.      The other people you are working with may have locked their
                copies of CG or Versaterm Pro, preventing them from being
                modified.

        2.      Make sure Vaccine is running, look in your control panel and
                see that the protection is turned on (incidentally, when you
                alter the preferences for Vaccine, the size of the file
                changes, since Vaccine has no "preferences" file)

        3.      Try replacing your cricket graph with someone else's, see if
                the problem persists.  Likewise for Pro.

        4.      Try reinstalling your system, use the same release as those
                coworkers of yours who are not experiencing this phenomenon,
                again, see if the problem persists.

        These are just ideas, they're not carved in stone, but they may
provide some insights...  good luck!

We'll never have exact figures, of course.  Here are some ballpack
figures that represent my estimates based on site accounts from over
100 sites, plus some additional information I've gathered elsewhere.

I believe that between 3000 and 6000 machines were infected by the
virus, at perhaps 500 sites maximum.

Many more 1000s of machine were affected by network disruption or
preventative action, however, but those machines were not
directly infected.


Many of these machines were "down" for only 6 to 12 hours.  Few of the
infected machines are used 24 hours per day, so most were not
discovered to be infected until Thursday morning. Within 24 hours of
the infection starting, folks at Berkeley had distributed source code
patches to stop its spread, and folks at Purdue had developed and
publicized an innoculation that would prevent infection.  Thus, most
machines were affected for less than a single business day.

Most admins discovered early on that rebooting all their machines at
once cleared them of the Worm.  Once this occurred, reinfection from
outside often failed to happen -- other machines were also being
cleared, and bugs (probably) in the Worm code caused it to spread more
slowly than many people think it did.  The massive infection that
occurred happened only because it had overnight on lightly-loaded
machines to probe across the net.  Once sites started to go down and
disconnect, the rate of infection dropped significantly.

A very large percentage of the infected machines were single-use Sun
workstations, or small Vaxen.  Thus, the number of users prevented
access was much less than the 20 people per machine quoted in one of
the preceding articles.  3-5 per machine might be better averages.

Many of the affected users were students.  Their time can hardly be
valued at $27 per hour.  On the other hand, many machines belonged to
faculty or research engineers.  Their time is usually valued a bit
more than $27 per hour.

Lost time is very difficult to value.  I'd guess that based on
everything I've heard and the information I've gathered, I'd estimate
the "loss" as between $30million and $50million.  McAfee's estimate of
$96million was, at best, badly estimated, and at worst self-serving
and irresponsible.  Numbers greater than $75million cannot be
supported in the face of critical analysis.

5% of the machines on a known-to-be-insecure network of loosely
administered machines were infected.  This is noteworthy, but it
was not the crisis some people have claimed it to be.
