It may be useful to compare UNIX with DOS.  However, if you are
going to do it, you should be a little more complete.

In most implementations, UNIX is a multi-user multi-tasking
system requiring a system manager or operator.  Media is not in
the hands of the end-user.  It gets whatever storage it requires.
DOS is a single-user single-tasking system designed to be
operated by the user.  Media is normally in his hands.  DOS was
originally designed to run, with an application, in under 64K.
(Had it not been, we would not have a virus problem; we would not
even have an industry.)   It is not reasonable to expect them to
manifest the same vulnerability to viruses, any more than they
exhibit the same functionality.

However, as it relates to viruses, the big difference between them
today is the number and nature of uses and users.  If UNIX were being
used for the same things and by the same number of users as DOS, it
would be just as vulnerable.

Be careful what you ask for; you might get it.  The vulnerability
to viruses arises from our ability to write and share
programs;  All complete strategies for dealing with them must
ultimately involve some restriction on those capabilities.  While
operating system functionality may be useful, I would rather
reserve the decision over such fundamental choices to the end-
user.

Much of what appears to be vulnerabilities to viruses in DOS,
e.g., the bootblock,  are simply the virus designer exploiting a
feature in the way that it was intended to be used.  The
bootblock is intended to give control to the program on the
media.  It operates the way that it was intended.  It contains no
surprises.  The virus designer uses it as the obvious solution to
the problem which confronts  every virus designer, i.e., how to
get control, how to get his program executed.

In the absence of malice the mechanism would be beneath the users
level of notice.  In the presence of viruses, he must be careful
what media he boots from and must avoid putting his media in
machines already booted.  In the absence of the feature, the
virus designer would get his program executed in some other way.
As a last resort, he would simply dupe users.

We may decide that being able to switch programs by switching
media is too dangerous a feature to have, but I am not ready to
concede it yet.

>I am sure that there are many complex issues facing a
>company such as Apple, with regards to this problem, and changes at

Here we are clearly in agreement.

>What users should be doing, is overtly pressuring computer
>manufacturers to address this need at the OS level, and start buying
>equipment from vendors who move in that direction.

The only machines that fully address this problem at the OS level
are "application machines" which do not present any ability to
modify or install programs.  Fred Cohen suggests that in a world
of such machines we would still enjoy many, but not all, of the
benefits of computers.  I would assert that we would enjoy many,
but not most, of those benefits.

Indeed, the advantages of user programmability are so great that
there is no chance that the readers will follow your advice, or
that manufacturers would yield to any such pressure.

In the end, it is not an operating system issue; it is an
application issue.  No matter what you do at the system layer, if
you include user-programming at the application layer, then you
are vulnerable to viruses.  Even interpreted languages, such as
REXX, BASIC, or key-board macro languages, which need not even
know what system they will run in,  can be used to implement
viruses.

I have used both GateKeeper and SAM Intercept and I prefer the
latter.  The main reason?  When "something suspicious" happens,
GateKeeper says "you can't do that!" then if you want to override,
you must open the Control Panel select GateKeeper and set up the
permission; with SAM Intercept, at the time of the happening you can
allow the action once or LEARN the action then and there!

Agreed.  But it is handy to be able to scan as soon as you pop in a
floppy.  VirusDetective DA is a good way to do this.

I only see this as being useful if you're trying to track the
propagation of a virus, but then you have to allow the "suspicious
action" which GateKeeper doesn't do (unless you gave permission, in
which case it isn't logged!)

I'm not trying to put down GateKeeper, if you want to fight viruses
cheaply, it's a must!  Keep up the good work Chris!

Subject: A new version of nVIR A (mac)

It seems that there is a new version of nVIR A, or at least that's
what the program Disinfectant reported. I will try to explain what it
did to my system. Unfortunately before I noticed that it didn't behave
as the well known nVIR A I erradicated it with Disinfectant.  After I
run the infected program (a THINK C program) it changed the type of
the files in the same folder (and folders therein) into a seemingly
random type, taken from another file. That is, if you list the files
by KIND under normal circumstances you would get THINK C as the kind,
but after I run the infected program it changed the type to "vamos.c"
that was just a file in the same folder. Upon further explorations
with ResEdit I found in the Desktop file in the APPL resource a
repetition. With Creator KAHL (as for all THINK C programs) but
Application "vamos.c".  I also found a resource of type =/VIR (for
typographical reasons by =/ I mean the symbol for not equal). Remember
that I had already ran Disinfectant.  Does anyone have a clue? or a
similar problem?

I have a question that maybe others want to ask too:

I am new to BBS'es. This is my first other than our company one, so I don't
think that my PC at home is "bugged" (though I have bought some shareware
disks). I find all of this talk about viruses facinating - and frightning.

1) How do I make sure I don't have any viruses on my machine, and
2) How do I remove any found viruses? Do I have to by programs, or are there
   some in public domain? Can they only be obtained from PC BBS'es, or over
   this network?

To whom it may concern:

I have been following the discussion on the possibility of a virus on
the VAX/VMS.  I am wondering if there is any more word on this
particular topic?

The reason I ask is because I am one of many users at Southeastern
Massachusetts University that are concerned about the welfare of our
VAX systems.  As it turns out, I have submitted the information on
possible VAX/VMS viruses to our SYSTEM MANAGER to inform him of the
possible threat.

If there is anynmore information, could you please send me the
information?

                                        Thanks in advance,

Infection report from Geneva - Switzerland.
===========================================

The Cascade 1701/1704 -B virus has been found in Geneva (Switzerland)
this week. It is the first time I see infected machines in that city.

At least two machines are infected. The diagnosis was made with
VIRUSCAN V35. There is no doubt.

It is possible that the infection is going outside the infected computer
club, but we are not sure at the moment.

I'll publish every interesting news.

Subject: New Virus From the Philippines (system unknown)

I have a user on campus who brought back a few disks from the
Philippines and is now having problems with all of his disks. (hard
and floppy) He states that all of his disks have bad tracks at the end
of the disks, and he receives "can not load" messages when trying to
load files from these disks.

I know very little about viruses and would like to know where I can
send a disk that I suspect might have a virus. I only have one copy of
the disk that I believe is infected, and I don't want to send it to
just anyone.

Subject: Equivirulence Map ?

Has it ever been tried to verify the center of 'epidemic' virus attacks?
What's in my mind is a map of the (PC)known world, splitted into
area codes.
Whoever catches a virus reports the type (if known), symptoms and number
of occurences on the PC's he takes care of. One for the late night home
hacker, lots for a company's support staff or universities.
If a virus begins to spread, USENET data exchange should be faster than
PD or pirated software exchange.
Data could be collected at one site in a relational database, with reports
sent every week (or so) to a new newsgroup (comp.virusmap)?
Some questions arise: Do you think, that
  -     the typical infection paths could be analyzed?
  -     this information would be useful to us?
  -     hyperproductive virus developers could be tracked down?
  -     virus avoidance could be made more effective?
  -     this would make any sense at all?
If the answer is yes, any ideas how to deal with
  -     the amount of data that should be expected?
  -     the world could be organized into areas (no problem within a town,
        but I talk about something a little larger)?

In my opinion future Virus defence has to be active and aggressive, not
the passive sit-down-and-wait-for-somebody-developing-a-serum. There's
lot of infomation in this group, but it has to be cross-referenced to be
really useful and can be given to persons not in the USENET family.
By the way, has anybody read Michael Crichton's 'The Andromeda Strain'?
It's a evil book about a virus, just nothing to do with computers.

Subject: Lode Runner Virus (Apple)

     Here is a copy of a virus report posted on Info-Apple.  The
report, I believe, originally was posted on Compuserve by
Brian McCaig.
     I would like to point out that subsequent messages on Info-Apple
have indicated that Speedy Smith is not the primary carrier of the
virus.
     I also have some questions.  (1) Does any reader of VIRUS-L
know if the French expression "non-destructeur" means
"non-destructive" or "indestructible?"  (2)Could anyone post a
version of VIRUS.KILLER (source code follows the report) written
in BASIC?  (It could be posted here or to Info-apple@brl.mil)
(3)  Because the university does not import VIRUS ALERT I
have not posted this report to it, for fear of replication.  Could
someone post this message to VIRUS ALERT if it has not appeared there
already?

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Well folks, here it is...installment number 3 in the Saga of the virus
for the Apple II.  First it was CyberAids, which wasn't all that great and was
quickly defused.  It was followed in June of 1988 by Festering Hate, a more
sophisticated and deadly evolutionary offspring of CyberAids.  F.H. spread
rapidly throughout the Apple II world and was particularly insidious as it;
infected (usually) the first .SYSTEM file in the root directory, usually
Basic.System, would infect more than one file per disk, would infect files in
sub-directories, and when it 'went off' would destroy all volumes currently
on-line at the time.  This included RAM disks and Hard Drives!

        By now, most of you are aware of Festering Hate and that there are
several good virus detecting/protecting programs available that have virtually
eradicated the FH virus.  It is to the credit of the Apple II community in
general, and selfless people like Glen Bredon that FH was halted before it got
too out of hand.  As a matter of fact it was the very vehicle that spread the
virus so rapidly that was also responsible for its quick demise.  After I did
my initial research on FH last year I wrote a brief study of it and uploaded
the study to most of the active BBS's in Canada and the U.S.  I also sent
copies to Glen Bredon and others who acted very quickly to develop the 'cures'.
 But it was the massive telecommunications network of Apple II users that
spread the details so quickly and stopped FH.
        Now, number 3 virus has just appeared.  Called, rather nostalgically,
"LODE RUNNER", it is not quite as destructive as its predecessors but its a
virus nonetheless.  Here's what I've been able to pull together so far:

SOURCE

        - Although we're not 100% positive it appears that the program called
SPEEDY SMITH is the culprit.  A recent import from France, Speedy Smith is one
of the fastest copy programs for the IIgs.  A full 800K disk copy takes about
50 seconds (without verification) to 70 seconds (with) using SS.  It has an
excellent SHR screen with 'thermometers' that indicate the copy's progress.
Unfortunately the reason we cannot either convict or acquit SS is that its
creators have seen fit to invent their own DOS.  This DOS is not readable by
standard Apple II sector editors such as the one in Copy II Plus.  There are
several reasons, however, for suspecting Speedy Smith.  First SS's displays are
in French and the virus's text screens are as well.  When catalogued Copy II+
indicates that there are 292 used Prodos blocks, but adding up the individual
files' blocks only totals 148.  And lastly, what better vehicle for the spread
of a virus than a copy program?

HOW WAS IT DISCOVERED?

        - Lode Runner was discovered almost by accident by several members of
the Apples BC Computer Society.  Shortly after receiving several new disks of
IIgs software, including Speedy Smith, one member found that his Test Drive II
refused to run.  This was followed by backups and originals of Space Quest I
and Police Quest.  At first it was thought that the member's IIgs was having
hardware problems.  But at the same time another friend from Eugene, Oregon
contacted us about having seen a French hi-res screen appear on his monitor
just before his Copy II+ disk was trashed.  Not being Canadian he was only able
to pick out the word "virus".  Armed with this info and the 'damaged' Space
Quest disks I spent a weekend checking things out.  At the same time other
friends in Oregon & California were independently analyzing infected disks.

HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOUR DISKS ARE 'INFECTED'

        - There are 4 ways of detecting Lode Runner:
1) When the virus "goes off" and erases your disk...not exactly the most
   desirable way,
2) If you have a copy of Space Quest I then you can use it to check all your
   disks.  Boot any suspect disk and wait until the drive stops.  Replace the
   disk with Space Quest and do the 3 or 4 fingered salute (OA-CTRL-RESET).
   NOTE: Keep Space Quest write protected so that it dosn't get screwed up. If
   Space Quest boots to the point where it asks you to press a joystick button
   then you can be pretty sure that the previous disk is OK.  If Space Quest
   trashes with an error message (#206) then the previous disk is likely
   infected.
   If you DO get an infected disk then you MUST either power down your IIgs or
   run the self-test before continuing with your testing to clear the RAM as
   the virus seems to install itself there.
3) A better check (and much faster) is to boot Copy II+ and run the 3.5" Sector
   Editor.  Do a read of Block 0000 (Track 00, sector 00, side 01).  If the
   first 3 bytes are   01  A9  50  then the disk is infected.  Those 3 bytes
   aren't the only bytes that are different but they are all that is necessary
   to identify the virus.
4) If you recall, last year during the Festering Hate panic it was noted that
   one of the best ways to have an Apple II virus was in BLOCK (0) on any
   Prodos disk.  At that point, anticipating another virus, Guy T. Rice wrote a
   small virus detector/fixer.  If you put this program into the
   SYSTEM/SYSTEM.SETUP folder on IIgs disks then it would automatically detect
   and correct modifications to Block (0).  Now for LODE RUNNER this will also
   work.. that is, it WILL detect LODE RUNNER and it will try to correct Block
   (0).  BUT, it appears that due to the method of spreading of LR Guy's
   program cannot correct it.  Every time you boot the disk it'll give you the
   virus detect error.  I think the reason for this is that LR installs itself
   in RAM upon bootup in preparation for infecting a new disk.. and the only
   way you can be sure that its gone is to either power down or run the
   self-test.. and since Guy Rice's program does an auto-reboot and corrects
   the block (0) all in one step then the RAM never really clears and the virus
   re-infects the disk.  And since you cannot write-protect the disk it becomes
   a vicious circle.  I am going to try to get these observations to Guy Rice
   in the hopes that he can modify his program.  NOTE: Three other problems
   with using Guy's program: its no good for 5.25" disks, it only works with a
   IIgs and it only works with disks that are bootable.  LODE RUNNER can infect
   ANY Prodos disk because it resides in one of the blocks created when a disk
   is formatted.

        There is a 5th way.. the friends in Eugene, Ore  have written a Binary
program to detect and disarm the virus and I will try to include it in this
file when I upload it.  The reason theirs is successful is that the detector is
not part of the disk being checked and thus the "circle" is broken.

METHOD OF SPREADING

        - As far as we can tell the virus is spread two ways: by being copied
with a copy program and by booting an uninfected disk (using OA-CTRL-RESET)
immediately after running an infected disk.  NOTE: For a disk to be infected it
must not be write-protected.  The virus does NOT infect actual files so none of
your files will look modified in either their file length or their modified
date.  The virus also does not search all drives, as did Festering Hate, so
cannot be detected that way.  Because it doesn't infect files it only infects
one spot per disk and cannot destroy any sub-directories.  Therefore your
cannot get rid of the virus just by re-copying the files...the virus is
actually part of the Prodos kernel created when the disk is formatted.


WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT "GOES OFF"?

        - To get Lode Runner to "go off" you must set your Control Panel's
clock to the following:  the MONTH must be October,  the DAY must be an odd
numbered day and the minute must be a number divisable by 8.  Next you must
boot an infected disk then boot (using OA-CTRL-RESET) any other disk.  This
second disk must NOT be write-protected or the virus won't activate.

        - Once the second disk is booted the virus will appear.  Its a red
screen with text characters as follows:

                     +++  SYSTEM  FAILURE  in :  +++
                                  08

and proceeds to count down  to zero where the screen changes to another with a
multi-colored scrolling background and the following text;

               000E   Copies.      Distr:Artistes Associes

                     ===  L O A D  R U N N E R  ===

              du  MASTERS CRACKING SERVICE    1988 Lyon

        By the time you've read the first screen the disk that you just booted
has been rendered useless.  LR does not appear to erase more than the current
disk and doesn't seem to affect 5.25" disks.  Not being an expert in French I
am unable to determine whether the phrase below the title means: "The first
non-destructIVE virus for the IIgs" or "The first non-destructIBLE virus for
the IIgs".  This is a 'moot' point however as it DOES destroy one disk when it
goes off.  In addition, and I believe that the writers of LR didn't plan this,
LR will destroy Space Quest 1 and Police Quest for the IIgs if they are booted
AT ANY TIME after an infected disk.. and if they are not write-protected.  It
is not necessary for LR to "go off" for these programs to be rendered useless.
I have only found these two that behave in this fashion but I am sure there are
more.. likely most of the Sierra programs for the IIgs.


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

        - As with the studies on Festering Hate there are many people who
          collaborated on the research for this virus.  Many thanks go out to:

APPLES BC members,
        Ross Woodhouse - for being so insistant that something WAS wrong.
        Pat Daley - for gathering data, programs and relaying info.

EUGENE, OREGON users,
        Jack Stalcup - for accidentally setting the virus off because the
        battery in his IIgs was dead.  And for sending the programs and
        keeping the communications alive.

        Neil Parker and Mike Suiter (sp?) - for analyzing LR and writing the
                                            detection/correction program.
