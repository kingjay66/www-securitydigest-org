Subject: viruses that reprogram ANSI keys
 
Hi,
     Just a quick note about viruses that reprogram keys to do
nasty things.  Several good terminal emulation packages have a
feature that allows you to 'lock out' any host generated key
redefinitions.  With Persofts Smarterm 220/240 series of programs
you can set the 'User Features Locked' and the program will ignore
all attempts to reprogram the keys with escape sequences.

[Ed. Not bad, but does MS-DOS's ANSI.SYS allow to lock out these
sequences?  I don't believe that it does.  If not, escape codes
imbedded in documentation, for example, can do a lot...]

Barry, I think it was supposed to be a joke. I mean, the company president's
name was Rick (or Dick) Cummings... Think about it. It's even better than that
thing by Mike RoChanle (Micro Channel). Remember that?

Here is Jeff Shulman's reply to my letter about VirusDetective.
 
 ----------------------------Original message----------------------------
Bob forwarded your letter to me.  I *would* appreciate you sending a followup
letter to the virus list since I feel my reputation is at stake.  I do
empathise with the possible hurt feelings a user may have when seeing a
bill for being honest.  I have since been sending a letter of explanation
as to why the price increased.  I am still sending users what they paid for
at the old price along with the bill (your friend *did* receive a disk if
you recall).  I'm not out to punish my honest users but to inform them that
there has been a price increase and I would appreciate it if they paid the
difference (after all it isn't fair to the new users who *pay* the current
higher price for someone who paid the lower price, at the same time, to get
the same service).

Subject: OS/2 and viruses...
 
OS/2 makes some hardware calls for things such as formatting a disk.
It goes around the bios.  As such, none of the monitoring type programs
are gonna stop an OS/2 FORMAT command to trigger.
 
Found that out the hard way! :-)

Programs such as Axe, which are stand alone decompressors, should not
be considered an effective defense by any means angainst virus attacks.
 
Consider a vanilla program, compressed and wrapped up in a decompress
shell. Fine.  Now, stick a virus around the shell (shell-within-a-shell).
When you execute the program, the virus executes, then the decompressor
starts to work.  The checksum doesn;t match, so the system hangs, or
aborts, or whatever.
 
However the virus has already run....  (viruses such as the TSR Israeli
Virus may not run, though, since the infected program is never really
run if it crashes....)

none of the com infectors I think would presently pass and none of the exe infe
ctors at present for the strains that homebase has gotten samples of could....b
ut exe header info for dos , windows and os2 is in essence somewhat the same(i.
e. exe hdrs for windows and os2 contain extensions to the regular format...) if
 the exe file from dos will run unchanged in the compatibility box then I think
 you may indeed have a possibility of infection... however os-2 executable woul
d tend to have selective parts of their exe header mashed...ones that I would t
hink would represent a real possibility of infection would be the improved stra
ins of the jerusalem virus(the strains that infects exe hdrs correctly) and oth
er exe infectors that are reasonable well behaved...however the subject of tran
sport viruses has come up before in conversations between john and myself and I
 think at least that it represents a real possibility...(also note that lacking
 a os-2 system at this time I am essentia!
lly winging it...I did however tak
e a look at the various header formats and various exe infectors that homebase
folks have provided disassemblies of in answering in this fashion). If any of t
he os-2 folks have comments negative or positive out there e-mail me and I will
 summarize to the net on this.I am also personally looking into this with respe
ct to 386, Interactives UNIX 5.3 and their DOS under UNIX Option!!
