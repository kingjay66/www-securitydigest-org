Subject: Infection report (PC)
 
I asked Ken (hi!) whether I should report a recent infection here
to someone, and to whom I should report it, and he suggested that
I post it here and let those folks doing tracking contact me if
need be... so... :-)
 
We recently have found Yale/Alameda in 3 of our micro clusters on
a total of approximately 10-12 disks.  We also found it on one of
our faculty's disks.  Fortunately, we feel we caught it early on,
and this particular virus is not difficult to eradicate, nor does
it cause irreparable damage.  The bad news is that we still do
not have permission to put regular disk checking in place for our
IBM clusters, and the discovery of the virus was more an accident
than anything else.  One of our consultants recently downloaded
VIRUSCAN off Homebase and was showing it to another consultant.
(Since our Scores infection in our Mac clusters last winter, every
time a disk doesn't work, we here the cries of "Virus!".  It
turns out that this time it was valid.)  I hope that with this
infection, as it was with Scores, we will be given the green light
to make some checking policies in the IBM clusters as well as the Mac's.
 
Those who track infections of various viruses are welcome to contact
me at IHLS400@INDYCMS.BITNET if they wish.  Please don't become
concerned if I don't respond immediately as I'm getting ready
to go on *VACATION!* for 2 weeks.  I will reply on my return.
(Computers... just say NO! :-)

Although Yuval's sample disk does contain those words, I assumed
that he must have put them there himself, as a way of labelling
the diskette.   When the virus spreads, it does not (as far as
I've been able to tell from both testing and disassembly) put
those words in the boot sector.   All it does is change the
initial JMP, and overlay 31 bytes of the original boot sector
(in the message-text area in at least some versions of DOS)
with its code to load and call the main virus from its "bad"
sector.
 
The words "SWAP VIRUS" don't occur anywhere on the
freshly-infected diskette I just produced.   Since the virus
doesn't really "swap" anything, I'm not sure how good a name
that is, although "Israeli boot" is poor for the reason you
give.   Naming is a pain, isn't it?   We could call it the
"Falling Letters Boot Virus" (tho' there'll probably be another
one next month...).

Subject: FluShot+v1.6 boot block checksum alerts? (PC)
 
Help!  I am either infected or else just mystified!  (Or...???)
 
I am getting frequent messages from FluShot+ version 1.6 saying,
        Boot Record Checksum(s) do not match!
and, indeed, if I go into DEBUG>L 0 2 0 1, there I find at offset
002E/ 5F 0E 0A at one time and B8 E2 09 at another.  My boot block
is changing!  VIRUSCAN version 0.4V30 does not detect anything.
 
My boot-block documentation here is scanty...  I did a VOLABEL C: and
the label I gave does not appear anywhere in DEBUG>D 0 L 200 output...
am I really looking at my boot block?  Isn't that where the label is?

The trick of defining a command sequence to create sushi on a unix system would
 compromise root integrity... most comm software that is capable of either emul
atining programmable terminal sequences or ansi.sys and programs that implement
 those sequences are capable of accepting a command line into a buffer or windo
w with the view attribute set to non-visible and then retransmitting that comma
nd to the host unix system all under remote control.... I could hardly call tha
t harmless... furthermore most users including a surprising number of systems a
dministration types are unaware that their terminal or programmable termulator/
file transfer package can be tricked in this fashion..>

I am looking for Anti-Virus-Software or Software to found viruses.
If there is everyone out there who can help me, please write me.
And if you don`t have Software i am also happy about a lot of sentenses.
(New Virus, Software, Letters, .....)
 
In my last mail, i don't write anything about my Work-System. I am working
on an IBM PS/2 Computer.
 
Please before you send programs, please Email me before. (andreas@edvvie.at)
 
Many Thanks,    Andreas

Subject: axe by sea (PC)
 
i did not mean to propse that axe is the cure all or preventative
for viral infections. i just wanted to point out what we had found.
 
in most cases, a virus attacking a program which has been axed
creates a situation where the axe'd program will not load properly
due to the compression used when the program was axe'd.
 
basically axe reads a file and like arc applies a compression formula
to the file and then writes the file back to the disk along with a
special loader incorporated in the file.
 
when a virus attacks the file, it changes (obviously) some of the
compressed data. however it does not really know that the data has
been compressed by axe. so when the user goes to load the program
the loader cannot un-compress the data and halts operation.
 
while not a cure all or anything like that it is a good way to spot
instantly if a file has been tampered with.
