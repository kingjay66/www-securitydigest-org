I wouldn't be surprised if it does exist.  I have seen a book called
"The Computer Underground" which gives tips and techniques for
breaking into computer systems, phreaking, blue boxing, etc.  I'm just
surprised that a book on writing viruses hasn't been released earlier.

     I personally found the Anarchist's Cookbook to be an awfully
enlightening and useful book, if only because it taught me things I
didn't know and might need someday. (Yeah, I read it. Couldn't find a
copy to buy for myself tho.)  It also taught me what I might want to
look out for.

     I don't think the parallel is quite accurate. I can think of
cases where I could use what I learned from the Cookbook. Why would
anyone ever NEED to write a virus/worm/trojan?

     In any case, I'm afraid something like this was bound to happen
eventually anyway. It's a free-information society, and virus-writing
tricks are as much information as anything else. Besides, it might
sell. I for one would be most interested in seeing such a book, esp
since it would help me to understand what these people are doing in
the first place. (The smallest computer I know anything useful about
is an IBM PC-RT; my normal working habitat is 370 VM/CMS and SunOS. My
knowledge of PCs extends to writing very simple batch files, and all I
know about a Mac is 'point-and-click-and-pray', so I tend to get left
in the dust sometimes.)

     Just as a matter of debate, do (the collectve you) think that
such a book would be that harmful? If someone was really intent on
writing a virus, it seems that they would find out what they need to
know anyway, somehow. Sure, there would be a few who would
'dabble-and-poke' at it because of the book, but they probably
wouldn't be able to do anything much. ??? (Point-of-debate only; I
tend to think some other things.)

Subject:  VirusDetective's configurability (Mac)

Today a user came by and told me he found the "INIT 10" virus. When I
asked what virus he was talking about, he replied "I don't know.  But
someone on [network name deleted] recommended to add INIT 6,10 17 and
32 to the Search list in VirusDetective". As I expected, the user had
found a legal INIT 10 resource in a CDEV (Vaccine), and thought it was
a virus.

Those of you who follow the virus discussions will probably know that
the Scores virus creates *among other resources* three INIT resources
of ID 6, 10 and 17, and that the nVIR virus writes 6 nVIR resources as
well as one INIT 32 resource into the System. But finding a single
INIT 10 without any other symptoms does not necessarily mean that
you're infected, even if that INIT is in the System file.

To detect Scores, Virus Detective's Author Jeffrey Shulman has
included the search string "CODE Jstart 7026 - for finding Scores in
applications".  If you want to search for Scores in the System file,
too, include the search string "DATA Dual -4001 7026 - for finding
Scores in System".  But don't look for a plain INIT 6 or 10 or 17, as
there are plenty of them in the sane world.

Don't abuse the configurability of Programs such as VirusDetective.
Adding strings like "INIT ID 6" or "INIT ID 32" will not increase the
program's success rate. Au contraire. All it will change is that
you'll have VirusDetective ringing bells and whistling like crazy on
many uninfected CDEVs and INITs.

Following are the Search strings that are included in VirusDetective
2.0 (plus one that finds Scores in the System). They are sufficient to
detect the nVIR, Hpat, Scores and INIT29 viruses on your disks.

nVIR any - For finding nVIR in all files
Hpat any - For finding nVIR in all files
INIT Dual 29 712 - For finding INIT29 in non-application files
CODE Jstart 712 - For finding INIT29 in applications
CODE Jstart 7026 - For finding Scores in applications
DATA Dual -4001 7026 - For finding Scores in System,Desktop,Scores
     files (*)

(*) Note that if VD rings on this, the two System files "Note Pad
    File" and "Scrapbook File" will be infected, too, and should be
    removed.
