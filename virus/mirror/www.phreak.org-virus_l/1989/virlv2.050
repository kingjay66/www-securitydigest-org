A copy of the INIT29 virus in a 'plain' document (i.e. with a file type
different to 'INIT','CDEV' or 'RDEV') will not be executed. It just
uses up unwanted space. Still, that PageMaker could break the network
security of Appleshare is rather odd.

        Nova University and ErrorNot Isolate Particular Computer Virus

        A hardware-induced computer virus could potentially affect 25
million microcomputers, according to a recent discovery by researchers
at Nova University and ErrorNot Corporation.
        The researchers say the virus is the result of faulty
programming in the microcode of a device used in computers.  Research
indicates this virus causes data corruption, and its random pattern of
attack with small data destruction makes it difficult to identify.
The virus's dormancy period varies from weeks or months to even years.
        Nova University's Computer Science Department has assembled
the results of its findings (TR-881101-1) and a risk-assessment
program that helps users determine their susceptibility to the virus.
Both are available on a disk for $5 from Dr. Edward R. Simco, Dean,
Computer Science Department, 3301 College Avenue, Fort Lauderdale, FL
33314; (305) 475-7563.
        The researchers at ErrorNot Corporation have created a
slotless device they say is effective in eliminating the virus.  For
more information contact William R. Griffin, President, ErrorNot
Corporation, 3200 North Federal Highway, Suite 120, Boca Raton, FL
33431; (407) 395-2306.

        Anyone heard about this from any other source?  Anyone at Nova
University or ErrorNot who would like to elaborate?  Cheers...

Note: This is an extract of the full report. Sensitive information has
      been removed. The full report has been sent to known authors of
      virus detectors and vaccines. Please distribute this version of
      the report as widely as possible. I don't have access to CompuServe,
      GEnie or CalvaCom.


A. HISTORY

The virus initially appeared in France. So far, it has been signaled
in Paris, Marseille and a few other places in France. Thierry
Lalettre, chief moderator of the Macintosh forum in CalvaCom, alerted
by user contributions in his forum, posted a warning to CompuServe and
mailed samples of the virus to a few authors of macintosh vaccines and
viral detectors, including myself.

Note: CalvaCom (formerly Calvados) is Europe's largest commercial
      electronic conferencing system, in the same spirit as CompuServe
      or GEnie, but mainly directed at owners of Apple products.



B. OVERVIEW

The ANTI Virus is a program that attaches itself to the end of the
main code resource of an application. It patches the main code so that
it is invoked in the first place each time the application is started.
An infected application will try to infect the system heap, if it
wasn't already infected beforehand (the system heap means the part of
the system that has been loaded into memory at boot-time. ANTI does
*not* infect the file 'System').

The virus does nothing hazardous besides propagating itself. It is
less contagious than the INIT29 virus, but more than nVIR.

The hypothesis made by Thierry Lalettre, stating that Apple France
Developer Support Manager Alain Andrieux' program 'Stamp 1.0b5' has
been purposely recompiled by an unknown person to include special
infection code, is wrong. A disassembly of all resources in the
application only showed up that it was infected in a normal way by the
ANTI virus.

Thierry also stated that the virus only attacks applications with CODE
ID=1 named "Main". This is not correct. Actually, the virus propagates
to all applications whose main code entry starts with a JSR. Most
compilers create this type of applications, and some of them,
including MPW, name the CODE ID=1 resource "Main".  Under certain
circumstances, the virus also propagates to all other kind of
applications (i.e. the ones which don't start with a JSR).

The virus assumes that the main program entry of the application to
infect is contained in CODE ID=1. This is the case in all normal
applications. Applications whose main routine is contained in a CODE
resource different from ID=1 will either not be infected or crash.

Portions of the code suggest that the virus has been written as part
of a copy-protection scheme.



C. DETECTION

<some stuff removed>

The virus can be detected by several means:

- - it adds 1344 bytes to the CODE ID=1 resource of the file. An infected
  application will have grown by 1K. The modification date is changed to
  the date and time of the infection.

- - it contains seven occurrences of the hex sequence $16252553. The last
  occurrence of this sequence is located 43 bytes before the end of the
  CODE ID=1 resource. The virus uses this sequence to detect if a System
  or an application has already been infected.

- - the virus also contains a 9-char. pascal string 'ANTI ' (hence its name)
  followed by the hex sequence. The 9-byte string is followed by the
  pascal string '#000000'.

- - it patches _MountVol and _OpenResFile.

Trap watcher programs like GateKeeper, RWatcher or Vaccine will
successfully prevent infections. There is however a restriction with
Vaccine: As the virus temporarily uses the pointer to the global
variables (A5) for internal tasks, Vaccine will not be able to access
the screen to display a warning alert. If the option "Always compile
MPW INITs" is unchecked, it will beep and wait that the user presses
'y' (allow resource copy) or 'n' (don't allow copy). If the option is
checked, Vaccine will allow the infection without warning the user. So
be careful if you use that option.

The next release of VirusDetective will be able to find this kind of
virus by looking for specific hex sequences.


D. REPAIR

Note: I personnally don't endorse this. Badly repaired applications
      may cause much more harm than the virus itself could ever do.
      An infected application should be deleted. I'm including this
      information for those who forgot to backup their disks.

The virus starts with the following hex sequence:

  000000: 6000 0028 0000 0000 1625 2553 0723 3030
  000010: 3030 3031 0941 4e54 4920 1625 2553 0723
  000020: 3030 3030 3030 xxxx xxxx

xxxx xxxx contains the saved values for the instruction words that
have been patched by the virus.

To repair an application:

1- Be sure you're working in a clean environment (uninfected Finder
   and ResEdit).

2- Open the CODE ID=0 resource. Write down the word at position 16
   (first word of the third line if opened with ResEdit). This value
   tells you at what position within the CODE ID=1 resource you have
   to look for the patch, and is usually $0000.

3- Search in the CODE ID=1 resource for the hex sequence I described
   above. write down the value I noted as 'xxxx xxxx'.

4- Still in CODE ID=1, find the location of the patch, with the value
   you found in step 2. The first word of the patch should be $4EBA.

5- Replace the patch by the two words you found in step 3.

6- Remove the whole virus code (everything from the virus start to
   the end of the resource). This step is not absolutely necessary.



D. INTERNAL WORKINGS

<lots of text deleted>

The _MountVol patch works as follows:

- - Call original _MountVol

- - Check if mounted volume is a floppy drive. If not, exit.

- - Check if floppy is old (400K) or new (800K) and if the disk is
  single-sided or a double-sided. According to the result, read in either
  logical block 192 or 384.

- - check for our hex sequence in position 8 of the block. If found, JSR
  to the code in position 0 of the sector, then exit.

Note: The virus does not contain any portion of code that writes something
      directly to a logical block. Also, the code that will be executed
      if the search is successful is not known at this point. This routine
      has a strong ressemblance to existing copy-protection schemes. It
      is very possible that the virus is part of a copy-protection. I
      won't comment on copy-protection per se, but I find using viruses as
      part of a product's protection scheme extremely unethical.

Subject:    Closed virus list proposal

             A proposal for a closed virus technical list
             --------------------------------------------

Following my original message concerning authentication, I have a
proposal which I wish comments on, namely the formation of a new virus
list (in addition to VIRUS-L) with a closed membership.

As you may be aware the issue of viruses is, and is likely to remain,
exceptionally sensitive. Subscribers to VIRUS-L who are industrial or
commercial concerns are naturally extremely reticent to disclose any
details of infections on open lists, equally researchers in the field
are loath to circulate any technical details over and above those
concerning the symptoms of the virus, and the disinfection methods.

I my case I am researching the area of viruses, attempting to analyse
the techniques of concealment utilised by viruses with a view to
the analysis of future trends in the threat from viruses, and to
develop possible counters to virus infection. Such work requires a
degree of technical information which many people will not reveal
on an open list, nor will they mail such information to a correspondant
on the list without authentication.

Therefore (and I have discussed this informally with Ken) I would like
to propose:

1. The establishment of a closed additional virus list
   with membership by invitation initially, followed by additions only
   on request with suitable authentication. (Checks with establishment,
   through known contacts etc)

2. That the materials discussed on the closed list are monitored by a
   moderator who would be responsible for circulating any non-sensitive
   material to VIRUS-L and VALERT-L. Eg, initial contact reports to
   VALERT-L, symptoms and information on disinfection software to VIRUS-L.

3. That VIRUS-L remain an open list for discussion on all aspects of viruses
   (hopefully people will realize that reports of new viruses must still be
   public and contain sufficient details to identify the virus, and take
   elementary precautions).

Finally regarding the security of the new list, I suspect that we can take
one of two approaches,

1. Handle traffic in an unencrypted manner and assume the possibility
   of interception on route either by intermediate uucp sites or by
   ethernet taps.

2. Encypt end-to-end with the obvious handling and key management
   difficulties.

I think everyone who subscribes to this list should realize that the
threat from computer viruses is likely to grow rapidly, as will the
difficulties of monitoring the spread of new strains and the
development of disinfection software. This is an area where a world
wide list such as that proposed can make a major contribution in
acting as a clearing house for virus information.

It is vital however that the members of such a list trust both the
integrity of the list and of the members (who would preferably be
either academic researchers in the field, or representatives of
companies or known consortia).

Comments please, either to the VIRUS-L discussion list or by email to me
personally. I will collate the comments and discuss the outcome with Ken,
and then mail the list concerning whether the formation of the new list
will go ahead.
