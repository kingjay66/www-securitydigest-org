Subject:      (c) Brain killers wanted (PC)

  We've been fighting what appears to be a winning battle against the
(c) Brain variant of the Brain virus here at SUNY-Binghamton for the
last couple of weeks.  Having just finished removing the little
buggers from a few of our disks (marked as suspicious because the
write protect tabs we put on them were gone), I am wondering if any of
the boot sector-restoring programs for the PC would be effective
against this virus.  Is wiping the boot sector effective against this
one?

Subject:      nVIR removal (Mac)

     Is there a Macintosh application available on Bitnet that will
remove the nVIR virus from a Macintosh application without destroying
the infected application? (If so, how could I get a copy of it?)

Subject:      Debrain.. (PC)

Hello...University of Guelph just discovered brain in one of our micro
clusters, and I was looking for Debrain, or any other anti-viral
programmes.  I seem to recall that there was some stored away on an
.EDU node, but I am not sure.  Can anyone tell me where I could obtain
a copy of debrain, etc??

Thanks in Advance..

Subject:  Why write a virus?

        I know this was discussed about a month ago, but it was only
touched upon very briefly.  I would like to know everybody's opinion
on what reasons people have for writing and releasing viruses. I am
expecially concerned with those that are not for revenge or other
personal reasons.  Please send your replies to FSCMH1@ALASKA and in a
week or so I will post the results on the list.
        T.I.A.
