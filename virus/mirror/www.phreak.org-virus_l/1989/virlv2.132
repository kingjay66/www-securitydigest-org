In virus-l 2:130, L. Anne Cole asked,

> Are you my database? CRUNCH."  Sounds rather strange, but...

Let us set the record straight on this subject:
 
No known software publisher has ever intentionally released a virus
into circulation, nor is it likely that any would do so, as it would
be contrary to their interests.  Viruses threaten the entire software
industry and expose the releasing party to an enormous legal
liability.
 
As "evidence to the contrary" Mr. Myer cites an article he read which
in turn vaguely suggested that some (unnamed and unnameable)
developers "might be introducing viruses as a means to fight software
piracy."
 
Software developers and publishers are as disturbed as anyone about
the spread of viruses.  We do not see their propagation to be in
anyone's interest. As producers of software, we are offended by the
way viruses assault our customers and deface the product of our
labors.  As heavy users of computer programs, we become as
inconvenienced as anyone when we fall victim to a viral outbreak.
 
The idea of releasing viruses to protect intellectual property rights
sounds as bizarre to us as would be the idea of bombing libraries to
protect authors' copyrights.
 
The Software Development Council has an active Virus Task Force which
exchanges viral identification information, and promotes the
incorporation of antiviral measures into mainstream software products.
If anyone would like information on what software developers are doing
to fight viruses, please send me your snail mail address.

Could you please post it to comp.binaries.ibm? I have only access to
the news groups.
 
Thanx in advance
 
P.S. If not possible could you send me a copy via email?

Subject: re: virus desinfecting
 
Rob J. Nauta asked:
> Furthermore, is there a program that desinfects COM or EXE files [...]
> I may start writing my own tool for it [...] delete the first 1701 or
> 1704 bytes seems logical in that case
 
This procedure would certainly destroy your program.  In fact, the term
"relocating" link-virus is only a metaphor (as is virus, at all) for
various techniques to achieve the following behaviour of the infected
(another metaphor) program:
1. run viral code (a whole transient virus, or at least the installa-
   tion part in case of a resident virus);
2. resume normal operations of original program.
 
With fully relocatable programs (I'm not quite sure whether all MS-DOS
COM files qualify as such), this could indeed be achieved by inserting
the viral code at the beginning of the file, but the 1704 (and other
virus strains) use a different approach.  1704 overwrites the 1st 3
bytes of the COM file with a Jump instruction to the end of the file,
where the main part of the viral code is appended; the original
contents of the 3 bytes being overwritten are saved somwhere in the
viral code (i.e. every file gets its own, suitably adapted, version of
the virus appended).  When the program is invoked, the virus restores
the original content of its 1st 3 bytes before transferring controll
there.
 
Hence, if you want to remove a 1704 from a COM file, you have to:
1. Retrieve the original 1st 3 bytes from the viral code (which is not
   trivial, but I won't go into details, here);
2. Replace the 1st 3 bytes of the files with their original content;
3. optionally, remove the last 1704 bytes from the file.
See below for a warning on the usefulness of this scheme.
 
EXE files have an elaborated structure, complicating desinfecting (and
btw. infecting) even more.
 
> At the moment everybody says 'install your software from your backups

I'd rather say: start with a clean system and install your software from
original distribution disks.
- - In any case, you have to start with a clean system (i.e. switch off
  your computer, and boot it from a clean floppy disk), before you
  attempt anti-viral measures (be it diagnose, or repair).
- - Usually, you don't know how long you have hosted the virus, so you
  do not know which of your backups to trust.  So, rather use original
  (hopefully clean) distribution disks.
- - If you devise a des-infectant program as outlined above, you can use it
  only for a particular virus strain.  But the next day, you will run
  across a variant of the virus (which saves the 3 bytes at some other
  place or in some other way), and your des-infectant will destroy your
  program instead of repairing it.
 
Better safe than sorry--hence, I do not use des-infectand programs,
even if they are available.

                      ASSMPC-L THE MISSION
 
Hi !!! Networkers and Hackers...
 
     This is  an invitation   to  contribute to   a new  mailing list,
ASSMPC-L. This list is located on USACHVM1 (in BITNET) and  deals with
issues     related   to   the     PC     assembly  languages    (Intel
8086/88/286/386/...).  There is  an initial programming goal  that the
managers of this list wish to accomplish:
 
     We are inviting all  users  to assist in  the coding of projects.
For instance, our first task  will be  a  Resident Program Manager. We
will  use  Turbo    Assembler   or   MacroAssembler to  develop    our
applications.
 
     An second  project will   be an AV  package  to  viruses, we have
already  a programs for  Jerusalem and Brain,  these could be help for
it.  (Thanks Ken).
 
     The users of this new surprising list will receive mail with code
contributions   and   discussions, and eventually  the  program source
listing  finished with the  help of the  participants. Then, the  list
will propose a new project to work on.
 
     Any and  all  code contributions, ideas,  and anything  else that
will help  in  achieving  this  opening   goal   will be  appreciated,
discussed, reported and acknowledged for the list.
 
                         Virtually... ASSMPC-L
 
         Come !!!
         The power is with us... We hope for you...

Subject: RE: Emergency contacts and vendors writing viruses
 
In mentioning the "Computer Emergency Response Team" at Carnegie-Mellon
as an Internet contact point for virus notification, you neglected to
provide any lead.  Is there an electronic mail address or telephone
number for the CERT?  [Ed. Sorry, the phone number for CERT is (412)
268-7090, and the e-mail address is CERT@SEI.CMU.EDU.]
 
Also, in the subject of "Are software developers releasing viruses," I
can add Microsoft Word... we have version 1.0 of Word at our site (if
you can imagine that!).  If you use a good disk editor and search for
the string "evil" you will find the text: "The tree of evil bears evil
fruit.  Crime does not pay.  Trashing program disk..."
 
I can't say that this may actually happen, since I haven't tempted
fate by making unauthorized copies.  However, it is a bit
disconcerting to see such a message imbedded in a commercial product.
