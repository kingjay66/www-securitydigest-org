Yes, this topic has been discussed.

If a virus is on a sector before format, it needs some kind of driver
(a program) to read it off the sector and into memory to become
executed.

If that sector is marked bad by prep (this is possible), I believe the
data that was contained on the sector will still be there.

I can't speak of what else is on the disk in the UK, but I have
given them full permission to include FLU_SHOT+ on that disk....

Subject: Anti-Virus Progs against Boot Sector Viruses (PC)

Agreed: no program which runs *after* a boot (which defines just
about all programs, right?) is going to be effective against a
boot time virus.  Just as no matter how good the lock on your door,
it won't work against Da Bad Guys unless you take the precaution
of actually turning the key and locking the door.

Simply don't boot off somebody else's diskette and you have
effectively locked your door against them.

In the event that you're already infected with a boot virus, there are
quite a few anti-virus products which will prevent such a virus from
further spreading off your system to some innocent floppy you might be
accessing...

Subject: "Benign" Viruses

In VIRUS-L 2.105 (May 4, 1989), David Stodolsky said,

I certainly hope not.  If you've written software for general public
use, you know it is extremely difficult to identify and eliminate
subtle, unintended bugs.  The last thing I want is for some
self-proclaimed wizard to release viral code that s/he "thinks" has no
negative side effects.

The thing about viral propagation is that there's no calling the virus
back; once it's been released it spreads all over, and you can't
recall the code for a bug fix.  It will pollute the environment for
time immemorial.

The only good virus is a dead one; they're too dangerous even for
programs with good intentions.

Subject: Den Zuk Virus (PC)

The following message was originally posted on the Homebase BBS (408
988-4004) in Santa Clara, CA.

Original-Date:   05/02/89 17:14:26
Original-Sender: JOHN MCAFEE
Original-To:     HOMEBASE VIRUS RESEARCHERS

     The Den Zuk (The Search) virus that I received from Ball State
University appears to be yet another version of the original
floppy-only variety.

     From an external observation I determined that it still contained
the bug that causes it to attempt (incorrectly) to infect 3.5"
floppies, thereby causing the file allocation table to be accidentally
overwritten.  It does not activate on monochrome systems but still
contains the time delay at <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<Del> entry, and will remove
itself from memory if a hard disk boot occurs.   It will infect
non-system disks and if such disks are then booted, the virus installs
itself, displays a the message - "non-system disk or disk error" and
then infects the next diskette loaded and booted.  There was no
apparent destructive code within this version.  Jim Goodwin currently
has this sample under the knife and should have a full report
momentarily.

      I want to again caution all Homebase researchers not to *FIX*
this virus.  It isn't broken.  The 3.5" infection bug is the only thing
that has alerted us to the corruptive versions that have replaced the
graphic display with a date/time activation check (usually followed by
bad news).  If this bug is fixed for testing or other purposes, and
the resultant modification escapes (as you know it will), we will have
the worst virus yet seen.  If you find something *WRONG* with any
virus, please note the code discrepancy and refer it here for logging,
along with any comments you might like to make about the slovenly
techniques of the original designer.  Just don't fix it.

Thanks.  John

Subject: Forward Message From J. McAfee regarding boot viruses (PC)

Forwarding message from John McAfee, dated 5/5/89:

I noticed David Chess' comments on the SYS command and boot sector
viruses.  It is important for everyone to understand that the SYS
command will ALWAYS remove a boot sector virus.  The command does
overwrite the boot sector and will remove the virus control code.
Now, it will not, of course, replace any bad sectors created by the
virus or remove the virus extension code, where the main body of the
virus may be saved.  Bit this doesn't matter since that code can never
be executed without the virus boot sector being active.  The result is
that the diskette my have one or two K less in available space.  The
only drawback to using the SYS command is that all versions of the
Pakistani Brain will continue to have BRAIN as the volume label, even
after the SYS command is executed.

The reason that I am taking the time to belabor what appears to be a
minor difference in opinion, is that the SYS command is, and has been,
our front line of action whenever we receive calls about boot
infectors.  Everyone has this command in the DOS utilities and
everyone who can type the three letters of the command can
successfully use it.  I ask Mr. Chess to PLEASE take a live virus and
verify what I have just stated.  It would be unfortunate for people
not to use this simple and effective tool.
