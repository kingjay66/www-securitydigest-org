Such an encryption system would only be useful if it were not
standard.  If it became standard, or at least widely distributed,
viruses would work their way around it by calling whatever interrupt
did the encryption on themselves before they became part of your
favorite program.  Even individual keys would not protect against
this.

I am a consultant at the computing center of the University of
Karlsruhe West-Germany. We were asked to assist the people at the
University of Hohenheim West-Germany. They found a virus spreading in
their public PC-pool.  We identified the virus as the Israel type on
wednesday afternoon. The people at Hohenheim had just one day to go
through their PCs and remove the virus with the help of H&B EDVXs Anti
Virus software (it had some trouble and didn't restore all files to
their original function, but the author of the program will check if
the virus is a mutant and will update the software) The viruses
destructive action on friday was tested on one PC: it destroyed all
executable files on the first attempt to run them. They didn't
experience any low-level format (only possible on PC-XT controllers
and a few AT contollers) maybe there is another threshold for that
action or it is a pure rumor. The virus reappeared after friday since
the students brought executable files on their disks. Larry Lover
(well known game) was pinpointed as virus infected and a major source
of the trouble since everyone copied this sw.

CYBER comes from cybernetics, a word invented by Norbert Weiner. Its
root is from the Greek Cybernos, the steersman. Weiner's original
application of it was in self-controlling systems.

Subject: WordPerfect Access to Drive A (PC)

The vanilla version of WordPerfect (as it comes from the box) uses the
default directory/drive for temporary files (it creates several of
them: a printer queue, backup files, timed backup files, and a couple
of others).  If you are using a version of WP that has previously been
configured for use from a floppy drive but copied and executed from a
hard disk, these parameters will still be in the setup file (something
like {WP}WP.SET).  These setup parameters can be changed by running WP
with a /S switch from the DOS command line for version 4.2, or by
pressing SHIFT-F1 in WordPerfect for version 5.0.  In either case,
it's under the section of 'location of auxiliary files'.

Check these values to make sure someone hasn't changed the values.
Another way to ensure the setup values are not wrong is by recopying
the master (the ones with the original WP label) diskettes.

Another possibility I just thought of: If you boot from a floppy and
do not have a statement SET COMSPEC=C:COMMAND.COM, the computer will
look on the A (or whatever drive you booted from) for COMMAND.  If you
try shelling out to DOS from WordPerfect (CTRL-F1), the version of
COMMAND.COM that was on the boot drive will be loaded.

We have several thousand versions of WordPerfect (4.1/4.2/5.0) on our
campus, and have not had any trouble with viruses--at least that
haven't been openly publicized or reported.  Some kind of WP virus
certainly could easily wipe us out; or at least bring us to our knees.

Subject: Internet worm report available in Gemany & Switzerland

Hi gang,

finally, I've got my Xmas present, directly from Bethlehem (it was
posted on 4th Jan by Air Mail: those reindeers seem not to be very
fast whith that sledge on their way across the ocean :-)

Thanks to Ken, I have now two reports on floppy disk:
1. Eugene H. Spafford: "The Internet Worm Program: An Analysis",
   Purdue Technical Report CSD-TR-823, available as Postscript File
   (neatly printing!) and as pure ASCII file.
2. Don Seeley: "A Tour of the Worm", Dept. Comp. Sci. Univ. Utah;
   this report is available with some SCRIPT-like markup and as a pure
   ASCII text, interspersed with many, many blank spaces. I didn't find
   a way to print or display this one neatly, or even legibly :-(

Eugene Spafford handles the topic (in 107 kByte) thoroughly and
clearly.  Large parts of the paper are comprehensable even to
non-Unix-connaisseurs like me; appendices present detailed
descriptions of worm-internals and fixes to Unix.  Also, a one-page
bibliography is given.

Don Seeley gives in (73 kByte) a nearly equally complete description
of the worms functioning, which can serve as a supplement to Stafford
(I'm somewhat biased here by the difficulty to read it from an badly
arranged screen).

Stafford grants permission to make copies of his work, without charge,
solely for the purposes of instruction and research.  I didn't see any
Copyright note in Seeley's report.

I volunteer as a sub-distributor of these two reports for the Federal
Republic and Switzerland, under the following conditions:
1. Both reports on floppy disks:
   Send me one 5.25", 1.2 MByte disk
        or one 3.50", 0.7 MByte disk
        or two 5.25", 0.4 MByte disks
   formatted for MS-DOS (cf. postal address in the header of this note).
   Enclose a stamped (German or Swiss stamps acceptable), self-addressed
   envelope.
   I'll copy the 4 files to your disk(s) and post it in the envelope you
   provided.  I'll post envelops with Swiss stamps in Switzerland, others
   in Germany.  I'll add no stamps, no stable envelope, I'll make no
   corrections to the address.
2. Stafford's report only, in print:
   Send me one stamped (allow for 204 g + weight of your envelope), self-
   addressed envelope and 4 DM or 3.50 sFr for printing costs.
   I'll print the report for you (worth 4.10 DM) on my private account
   and post it in the envelope provided, as above.

I hope everybody interested in the two reports will be able to agree
with this proviso, which is designed to save me a lot of unneccessary
work.

If anybody in Europe, but outside Germany and Switzerland, is still
interested in the reports, please drop me a note to my EARN/BITNET
address, and I'll try to make some suitable arrangement.  But be
prepared to act as a sub-distributor for your country, then!

Best wishes
            Otto

[Ed. Thanks Otto!  That second report, TOUR.N, was written in nroff, I
believe.  It also comes with a file called TOUR.CRT which was
formatted for CRT viewing.  Printing that file on a printer which
obeys backspaces and underlines will work just fine; that's what I
did.  Anyone more fluent in nroff than I (read: at all fluent in...)
might be able to format TOUR.N for another output device.  Thanks
again.]

Can anyone give me further information on this virus? Is it the "hPAT"
variation of nVIR, or is it another virus altogether? I have seen
mention of articles in comp.sys.mac, but that's not available to me
here on BITNet.  Thanks for anything which you might find.

Subject:      Virus created by software copying company?

It seems from reading the last several digests that a certain company
who produces Word Processing software, has yet another virus to
contend with?

In all fairness, since the company does not (I think) produce the
disks they sell perhaps they should look at the company who does their
production runs?

I could easily see a virus sitting in a duplicator passing itself on
to each disk that runs through the duplicator.

[Ed. Don't mass-copiers essentially do a sector-for-sector diskcopy
from an original?  Does anyone have any more info on this?]

Subject:  encryption

There is a bit of discussion on the subject of program encryption for
virus prevention in back issues of VIRUS-L (I think maybe around July
or August of last year).  The two major glaring flaws in the idea are
that it takes time to decrypt the programs before you run them, and
that the encryption/decryption program itself could become infected,
since it clearly cannot be stored in an encrypted format.  Also,
program encryption cannot easily protect the operating system, since
that also cannot be encrypted, so boot block viruses and the like are
still pretty pervasive.  The second problem is not easily dealt with,
but here is a bit of elaboration on the first:

If a virus is out to beat an encryption scheme, then it probably
doesn't make much difference which one is being used; even if some-
thing pretty hairy like DES encryption is being used, the virus can
intercept keyboard input and wait for the key to be entered.  Any
encryption scheme can be circumvented fairly easily by a virus
designed with that in mind.  However, using encryption of any kind
would provide excellent protection from most other types of virus.
Since the actual algorithm doesn't matter as much as the encryption
itself, a very simple algorithm would achieve largely the same results
as a complicated one.  Therefore, the problem of time consumption can
be fairly eradicated by using a fast, simple algorithm (e.g. a single
cipher).

Keep in mind that even a simple virus like Brain will spread regard-
less of program encryption, because it attaches to code that could
not be stored encrypted.

I've had similar problems occasionally with Word Perfect 4.2.  I've
not had any such with WP 5.0, but then I've been using WP 5.0 only a
while.  Those problems were traced to various possible causes, *none*
of them viruses.

Yes, WP sets up working and backup files for itself, usually in the
default directory unless you specify otherwise when you do WP setup.
You could have lost or damaged your setup file (named {WP}SYS.FIL ).
I think I've established that too little RAM also allows WP to start
but soon do silly things.  Have you added drivers, memory resident
software, or anything else that may reduce RAM?  Lastly, WP sometimes
looses control of itself when I ask it to load document files from
another word processor or files it created but were munched by a
hapless user.  This latter possibility is corrected by rebooting and
not loading those files; the first two would stay with you until
they're corrected.
