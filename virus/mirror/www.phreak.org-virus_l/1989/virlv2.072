I noticed that Dick Tracy is getting into computer viruses.  The
strip, which has run for years (and which was pulled by several papers
years ago because of its violence and sleazy characters), is currently
dealing with Tracy's fight against some bum who has infected the
police department's machines.  The strip seems to ignore the fact that
mainframe computers have numerous offline and human controls that
would make such an event extremely unlikely.  As such, it is spreading
disinformation.

  Relative lack of familiarity with computers is not the only reason
  for innacuray in media virus reporting. Among other factors, there
  is the notion that the readers/viewers would not understand the
  details or would have little interst if the complexities were
  proper;y explained. It is not only the media that takes this view.
  I have talked with computer security professionals who believe that
  it is better to blur the destinction between the classic viruses and
  other problem programs than to risk confusing the public.

  Another factor is the problem of type/time fitting. If a reporter
  has only 1000 words or three minutes of air time to report a virus
  case, it encourages the reporter to cut out details and paint
  everything with a large brushstroke. (I have gone through this
  fitting problem recently when I was asked to write a virus article
  for a NJ State Govt. MIS newsletter. If it's hard for someone who
  is aware of the complexities, how much harder it is for someone who is
  baffled by the complexities.)

I'm fairly new to this list, and I have seen this question crop up
in past digests, but I'll go ahead and ask it again anyway...

Here at Wayne State, our Computing Center has recently become actively
involved in fighting viri on a large scale.  We formed a small group
on campus primarily responsible for disinfecting campus machines (both
Macs and IBMs), making available PD and Shareware anti-virals to the
university public, and educating people in preventative medicine.

We are just getting off the ground, so I was hoping someone could help
me out with this. I am looking for *any* IBM PC anti-virals in
addition to what's on the Virus-l filelist at Lehigh.  I have already
gathered what's out there (at Lehigh) as a start, and I have also
looked at the SCFVM's PUBLIC list (most of what's there seems to be
Macintosh vaccines).

I have heard mention of some other disinfectors/prevention mechanisms
in addition to what's on virus-l (including HDSENTRY, DEBRAIN, and
Vaccine.com) and some newer releases (FSP 1.51 and CHECKUP 2.1).  Any
other reliable disinfectors/checkers/etc. (PD, Shareware, or
commercial) are welcome and appreciated.

I would be very appreciative if you could give me any sources to look
into, where can I get some programs, or if you have copies of any
programs if it is possible to send them to me via my Bitnet address.

Please send responses, etc. directly to me.

Thanks in advance...
