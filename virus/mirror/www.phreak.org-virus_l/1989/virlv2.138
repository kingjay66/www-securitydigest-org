I read the messages about the so-called WP virus. The message states
that the virus attacks WP.EXE and any other EXE file. WP complains
with 'Can't find correct copy of WP.EXE' and something more. This is
not a WP virus ! We have to thank Wordperfect Corporation for building
in a virus-checker in WP.EXE.  WP checks its own EXE file and prints
this message when it has been modified.  This traps EXE infectors. It
seems to me that this virus doesn't infect WP.EXE specifically, just
any EXE file that is started, with WP.EXE as the only one giving a
proper warning.

Subject: Request for info on viruses (PC)

Hello! I'm new to this list. I wonder if any of you could send me info
on (c)Brain, Ping-pong virus and a virus which adds 1701 bytes to .com
files (call 1701 virus?). Info such as how diskettes/harddisk get
infected, what these viruses do and the procedures/vaccines to remove
the viruses would be of great help to me. You can send the info direct
to me at CCEYEOYT@NUSVM.  BITNET.Thanks in advance for all your help.

Subject: The strange story of the WordPerfect virus (PC)

  A virus which specifically infects WordPerfect was described recen-
tly by people from Pace and Stanford.  Despite a few discrepancies in
some of their descriptions, I suspect that they have the same virus
which was described in VIRUS-L last January by Eldad Salzmann and Dirk
Bode.  In any case, since I have just now discovered the explanation
for that virus, I am giving it here.

  Last January, Eldad Salzmann described in VIRUS-L how his Word-
Perfect program suddenly started looking in drive A: for the file
WP.EXE when it had previously been working well from his hard disk.
Soon Dirk Bode reported that this behavior sounded like the problem
they had, which was caused by a memory-resident virus that attaches
itself to every executed COM or EXE file except WP 4.2; however it
prevents WP from using the hard disk.
  This sounded a lot like the behavior of the Israeli virus, although
as far as I knew, that virus never alters normal execution of a pro-
gram it infects.  Also, while one could see from the disassembly that
the virus was deliberately coded not to infect COMMAND.COM, there was
absolutely nothing to indicate that WP was also singled out for special
treatment.  So my guess was that either someone had hacked the Israeli
virus to make it attack WP, or that the WP problems were caused by
something other than a virus.
  Later Otto Stolz kindly sent me a copy of Dirk's virus, mentioning
that he could find no difference between it and the Israeli virus.
But it was only a few days ago, when Eldad sent me his copy of WP.EXE,
that I finally got around to researching this virus.  I have now found
the solution to the enigma.
  First of all, I verified that the WP virus is indeed identical with
the Israeli virus.  There now remained two main questions: (1) How
can a virus which is programmed to add code to files without affecting
their behavior, not do this in *all* cases?  (2) What is so special
about WP.EXE?  I discovered that when the virus is in RAM and WP is
executed, instead of adding 1808 bytes to the end of WP.EXE, as it
does with almost every other EXE file, the virus *overwrites* part of
WP.EXE (at least in the case of WP 4.2) with the 1808-byte viral code!
Now when a WP.EXE file is executed, WP apparently checks itself for
validity before doing anything else.  If the virus has overwritten
code instead of appending it, WP will discover that it is invalid.
This causes it for some reason to look for the file WP.EXE on drive
A:.  If it doesn't find it, it issues the message "Can't find correct
copy of WP.EXE".  In any case, one can no longer use the copy of
WP.EXE on the h.d.
  This was where I had gotten to at the beginning of the week.  I
dropped the subject for a while to work on other things, until yester-
day, when (without consciously thinking about the matter) it suddenly
hit me *why* the Israeli virus treats WP.EXE differently from other
EXE files.  In order to determine the length of an EXE file it is
infecting, a virus can use the the length-of-file field (bytes 2
through 5) in the header at the beginning of the EXE file, and this is
indeed what the Israeli virus does when infecting EXE files.  But what
if the value of this field is incorrect??  I looked at these bytes in
the uninfected WP.EXE, and found that they were 80 01 29 01 (hex).
Translating, we get (01*256 + 29h - 1)*512 + 01*256 + 80h = 151936,
which is much smaller than the actual length of the file (269963
bytes).  Checking the infected WP.EXE I found that the starting
address of the viral code was precisely 151936.  Also, by changing
these bytes in the uninfected WP.EXE to 8B 00 10 02, I was able to get
WP to execute normally even after infection.  Thus my hunch was con-
firmed.  (As to why the value of this field was incorrect in the
header of WP.EXE, I leave this to the WordPerfect Corp. to explain.)
  I have also heard of another file, PK36.EXE, which is overwritten
by the Israeli virus.  Presumably this too is due to an incorrect byte
count in its header.

  The description by "IA96000" of the virus discovered at Pace differs
from that of the Israeli virus in a few respects.  However, experience
has taught me that descriptions of viruses at a time of panic are
often inaccurate, so that my guess is that it's the same virus.  In
any case, anyone who needs a program for eradicating the Israeli virus
(plus a few others) can obtain one (UnVirus by Yuval Rakavy) by writ-
ing to me.  (Please indicate if you want it in uuencoded or xxencoded
form.)
