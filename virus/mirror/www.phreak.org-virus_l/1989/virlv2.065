Subject: Notification Schemes

Some further thoughts on the notorization scheme proposed by
lambert@dockmaster.arpa (actually motorolla GEG)

Mr. Lambert notes in his rebuttal to the first round of comments that
they were uniformly negative.  Since I was one of the people who
submitted a negative comment, I think I am qualified to comment on
this.  Nowhere in your posting did you provide any details on what
your scheme exactly is.  You gave us a bunch of pointers to government
and internet documents (including the definition of the RSA, as I
recall), and you made your posting from dockmaster, so presumably we
are supposed to accept all this as proof that you know what you are
talking about.  Unfortunately, it backfired.  All you told us is that
you had figured out how to solve all the world's computer security
problems using notarizers, and that if we wanted to know how to do it,
we should read your paper.  No.  There are probably at least a hundred
papers written in the field of computer security every week, and none
of us is going to go to the effort of looking this new one up just
because you can site lots of documents like "(see ISO 7498-2)".  If
you want us to read your paper, tell us about it.  How does your
scheme work?  Walk us through it.  You say that software inherits
notarizing. That's it.  Then you blast what a bunch of other people
have said.  Of course people reacted negatively.  Computer security is
a hard problem, and there is enough nonsense written on the subject
that all ideas are not automatically excepted as being valid.

I started out planning to respond to your responses to peoples
responses to your system, but I realized I had NO IDEA what your
system is.  I went back and re-read your two postings, and realized I
STILL had no idea what you are suggesting.  Perhaps you could take
five minutes and write a short "A does this and then hands it to B who
then computes a checksum and then does that with it.  After this end
users can do Z to their software to test its validity."  I suspect the
letters written to virus-l about your scheme would suddenly become
MUCH more relavent.

Also, I'm curious why you found it necessary to make your postings
from Dockmaster.  If Motorolla isn't willing to hook the people in its
network groups up to the internet, I have a hard time believing that
they understand what networking is all about.  If you can't get
virus-l at work, then that means you can't get email at work, and I
just can't imagine a company hiring a bunch of network specialists and
then not giving them access to the internet.

I would enjoy continuing the discussion of your scheme, since it
sounds like it might be interesting, but PLEASE tell us what your idea
is.

An end user, recently having read about viruses, found some
unexplained, unfamiliar files on his hard disk.  Turns out that
dBase IV has a known bug which leaves untidy file droppings
with extensions of .TMP,  .$ED,  or  .$VM.  When you type them,
you'll see YOUR data.  They're safe to delete without losing data.

You are confusing two separate issues.  First, there is the use of
cryptographic keys to achieve privacy, authentication and integrity.
Second, there is the distribution and maintenance of those
cryptographic keys.  These are separate and distinct problems, and
need not be considered together.

You seem to be concerned about key distribution, so let me address
that issue.  Consider, if you will, distributing the public half of a
public key set so ubiquitously, that a special distribution channel is
not needed.  This is roughly analogous to giving out your phone
number; if it is not an unlisted number it is easily verified.

Other than that, there are several well-defined protocols for key
distribution.  Check out the OSI Directory Services X.509
Recommendation for the best example.

The bottom line is, key distribution requires a trusted entity.  Once
you trust that entity, you implicitly trust anything it gives you.
You have no choice or the system does not work.  Note, this is no
different than in a "manual" system.  If I do not bump into you
personally and you give you my key, I am trusting someone to give it
to you, i.e., a bonded courier service.

Finally, let me address your comment about "transmitting something
simpler".  It does not work as simply as you suggest.  For example,
many checksums allow blocks of data to be swapped without being
affected.  Thus, file size and most checksums are not appropriate.

As for sending the entire program, the uncorruptable method is
typically prohibitive in terms of cost to use too often.  That is why
encryption is employed in the first place.  The idea is to use the
expensive channel infrequently for the keys and use the keys over
insecure, inexpensive channels to achieve privacy, authentication and
integrity.

Subject: nVir2 on the Mac

I'm relatively new to this discussion and I have not seen any
discussion of Macintosh viruses, but I thought I would place my query
here anyway.

Recently the the hard disk we use for our Appleshare network at the
University of Oregon Computing Center was and is infected by a form
of the nVir virus which we have not previously encountered.  We have
numerous public domain virus programs (AntiPan, Interfereon, VirusRX,
VirusDetectve, Ferret, KillScoresUs, AntiVirus, and Vaccine) but none
of them has been able to adequately deal with the strain of nVir we
have encountered.  For those of you who have dealt with Macintosh
viruses before we usually run Interferon on the suspected disk and if
an nVir virus is found we remove it with Anti- pan.  The problem is
that none of these programs was written for this new strain of nVir
which is being called nVir2.

Has anyone out there run into the nVir2 virus? And if so, does anyone
know of a good method for getting rid of it.  The virus will infect
ResEdit and VirusRx if you attempt to run either one with a system
that is already infected.  The symptons of the virus include not
letting a user print, telling the user they do not have enough memory
to open applications, and locking the machine if Vaccine is installed.
The virus appears to be much like the standard nVir virus which
AntiPan can deal with, but more sophisticated so that AntiPan cannot
delete it and VirusRX is immediately infected when run.  We use a
locked disk with a system and the virus utilities when trying to find
and eradicate viruses.

We have been able to get rid of it, but at the expense of removing and
replacing numerous software packages and the System and Finder files
from the System Folder (which includes moving fonts and desk
accessories first).

To us this virus appears completely new.  I apologize in advance if
all of you have already seen this numerous times, but if so please
reply if you have had success in removing this strain of nVir.

Subject:      RE: File lock protection (Mac)

Set the file locked bit will prevent a virus from using the high level
write routines to change the file.

This "ups the anti" and makes a virus that can defeate this protection
more expensive to write.

Most anti-virus techniques fall into this category.  That is, you
make the virus writer work harder to infect your system.

To write to the locked file the virus writer on the Mac would probably
have to use low level routines and do sector read/writes with manual
update of the catalog.

Joe McMahon (bless his heart) has assembled a very nice virus
protection distribution service.  TELL LISTSERV at SCFVM INDEX PUBLIC
to see the catalog.  I should note that this service covers Macintosh
only.
