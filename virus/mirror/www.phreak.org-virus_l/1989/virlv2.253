VIRUS-L Digest   Tuesday,  5 Dec 1989    Volume 2 : Issue 253

VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: New papers on IBMPC viruses

Two papers have been added to the anti-viral archives.

solomon.lst     List & description of less common viruses
msdosvir.a89    Virus catalog, with extensive information

solomon.lst
        A description of some of the more recent and obscure viruses
        by Dr. Alan Solomon.  The viruses described include:
                Ogre
                Typo
                Dark Avenger
                Vacsina
                Mix1
                Fumble
                Dbase
        For each virus covered, the following topics are discussed.
                Recognition and detection
                How the virus copies itself
                What the virus does
                How to get rid of it
                Other information
                Technical details
        This information is extracted from the documentation for
        an anti-viral package, and was sent by the author.

msdosvir.a89
        The autumn '89 issue of Dr. Klaus Brunnstein's virus catalog
        for MSDOS computers.  Viruses covered in this are:
                Autumn Leaves = Herbst = "1704" = Cascade A Virus
                "1701" = Cascade B Virus
                Bouncing Ball = Italian = Ping Pong = Turin Virus
                "Friday 13th" = South African Virus
                GhostBalls Virus
                Icelandic#1 = Disk Crunching = One-in-Ten Virus
                Icelandic#2 Virus

                SHOE-B v9.0 Virus
                VACSINA Virus
                Vienna = Austrian = "648" Virus
        A typical entry would have the following sections and
        subsections:
                ==== Computer Virus Catalog 1.2: ====
                Entry, Alias(es), Virus Strain, Virus detected when,

                             Forthcoming Subjects

         The  following is a list of possible articles in forthcoming
         editions.  These are only suggestions and  I  welcome  other
         ideas or more extended examination than listed.

         1.   Should  we  trust  public  domain  anti-virus software?
         There are many arguments both for and against public  domain
         anti-virus software - this article should attempt to outline
         its  pros  and  cons  and  provide   some   guidelines   for
         prospective users.

         2.   Practical  steps  for  non  experts  in  dealing with a
         network  computer  virus  attack.   What  should   be   done
         immediately by systems administration in the face of such an
         attack?

         3.  Procedural steps to preventing computer virus infection.
         A  checklist  of procedures and rules which if observed will
         minimise the risk of a virus attack.

         4.   Anti-virus   software   evaluation   in   a   corporate
         environment.    By   which   criteria   do  large  corporate
         microcomputer using organisations judge such  software.   Is
         there consensus on this point?

         5.   How  do  you  test  the  value of an anti-virus package
         without having access to computer viruses?

         6.  'Lab'  viruses  versus  'real  world'  viruses.   Is  it
         necessary  for  researchers to create viruses?  What are the
         benefits and does experimentation present any dangers?

         7.  Towards a common terminology  and  nomenclature.   1701,
         Fall, Cascade, Hailstorm, 1704 - how do we overcome the fact
         that there is no agreement  or  consensus  about  naming  or
         classifying  viruses?  Why is this?  Equally, can we develop
         an agreed glossary of terms about the  types  of  virus  and
         their methods of infection?

         8.   Does  commercial  interest  on  the  part of the 'virus
         industry' worldwide inhibit the anti-virus war?

         9.  Case studies.  I should very much like to  recieve  good
         case  studies  which  detail  an  actual  virus  attack, its
         impact, and the methods used to clear  the  infected  system
         and  restore  operations.   Specifics about the organisation
         need not be stated but a clear description of  the  affected
         computer environment is necessary.

         10.   Worm  programs.   Classifying  network vulnerabilities
         and/or analysis of recent worm programs such as Internet  or
         the  two  well  known  NASA  SPAN  attacks.   Are  there any
         universal procedures or  methods  to  prevent  such  attacks
         and/or control them?

         11.   Statistics  about  virus  attacks.   Will  it  ever be
         possible to collate accurate data about the  propagation  of
         computer viruses?  Refusal to report incidents means that at
         best we can only guess about the spread of specific viruses.
         Can we tell how fast a virus will spread by its design?

         12.   Mainframe  viruses/ replicative attack programs.  Fact
         or fantasy?  Specific  incidents  would  be  helpful.   What
         factors  have  served  to suppress mainframe virus writing /
         propagation  /  reports?   Patches  (to   increase   general
         security) for specific machines would be welcome.

         13.   Forensic  evidence.   Most countries have no effective
         legislation to combat computer  misuse.   Even  if  laws  to
         criminalise  virus  creation  are  introduced  (such as that
         recommended by the Law Commission, UK, or implemented by the
         state  of  California, USA) the courts will face a difficult
         task in prosecuting.  Are  methods  available  to  trace  or
         identify  computer  virus  writers?   Would this evidence be
         sufficient to convict in a court of law?


- ---
         Virus dissections  (the  analysis  of  a  specific  computer
         virus)  are  always  welcome.   These should not exceed 2200
         words.   Also  details  for  programmers   providing   virus
         hexadecimal  patterns,  infective  length,  entry  point and
         offset.

There is a virus on the amiga that looks for an executable that is in the
startup batch file and moves the executable`s code into a data segment and
inserts itself into the code segment.  If it can't find the startup file
it then inserts itself into the dir command.  It is easy to spot as one
of your commands changes size, and you just have to delete that command to
kill it.

anything unless you explicitly execute it and that SCANV
doesn't detect it.  Maybe these will find it if it is

I've never heard of Byte Bandit affecting printing, but you generally
can't predict what a virus will do on someone else's system. There are
too many variables and virus code is generally too badly written. The
only answer is, if the problems show up with the virus in memory and
not without it then the virus caused them.

Well, my personal opinion is that someone used a random name generator
to pick a four character resource type.  Then again, it could be a
virus from the depths of the USSR's intelligence community, released
to sow dissension among groups in W. Europe and distract them from the
momentous events in E. Europe.  What use is speculation, though?

When someone catches the "author" of this latest nVIR clone, I think
the first question he or she will be asked by the tabloid reporters
is, "Was the virus a feeble attempt at an anti-semitic statement?"
Until then, I'll stick to the random name "theory."

Subject: Yale virus (PC)

Hello!

The Yale/Alameda virus is essentially harmless.  The message you
report was not present in the version of the virus that I am familiar
with; are you sure it comes from the virus and not from some line in
the autoexec.bat file?  If it does come from the virus, then you are
dealing with a different version than the one I know and you should
take my information with a grain of salt.

The Yale virus that I know is a boot sector virus.  It is easy to get
rid of -- boot the computer from a clean, write-protected floppy and
give the command SYS x:, with x: being the drive holding the infected
disk.  The Yale virus that I know does not infect hard disks.

I hope this helps!  Best wishes,

Subject: Preventing the "Ping Pong" virus (PC)

Greetings,

    We seem to have an outbreak of the "Ping Pong" virus here at
Northwestern University.  I am wondering if there is some sort of
anti-ping-pong utility out there.  Is there such a thing that would
allow writes to a disk, but only if it is not to the boot blocks?
What is the best way to combat this beast.  I think we have version B
here, as it infects floppies as well as hard disks.

    On a related subject, what is the latest version of viruscan?

                                        Thanks in advance

Yes the "Jude" virus is for real. However, so far it only has shown up
at the University of Zurich and Swiss Federal Institute of Technology
(ETH) Zurich, Switzerland. It is an exact clone of nVIR type B; the
only difference being the name of the viral resource which has changed
form "nVIR" to "Jude".

VirusDetective 3.1 positively identifies the new virus as nVIR strain.
Both Vaccine and GateKeeper successfully prevent an infection.
GateKeeper will, however, let through some of the "Jude" resources,
but no contagious infection results.

New versions of Disinfectant (version 1.3) and other anti-viral tools
should be out real soon.

Subject: Morris Trial Postponed

[Ed. Thanks for typing this article in, Tom!]

Quoted from COMPUTERWORLD - December 4, 1989 - page 17

     `Morris seeks classified data' by Michael Alexander, CW Staff

SYRACUSE, N.Y. -- The trial of Robert T. Morris Jr., the young hacker
alleged to have launched a worm into the Internet last year, was
postponed last week after his lawyer notified the court that he needs
access to classified information he claimed is critical to the case.

    Additionally, Morris' lawyer, Thomas Guidoboni, charged that the
government had not responded quickly enough to requests for a list of
computer sites allegedly struck by the worm.

    "The trial was postponed at my request over government opposition
because we needed more time to prepare," Guidoboni said.

    In a motion filed Nov. 21 for a continuance, Guidoboni said that
the defense had filed for a motion under the Classified Information
Procedures Act (CIPA) requesting classified information important to
the case.  In the same motion, Guidoboni said the government had
failed to provide him with a complete list of the institutions that
the government intended to prove had been affected by the worm and a
list of witnesses it intended to call.

    "I have been told that some of the information that is useful to
my case is classified," Guidoboni said.  "It may or may not be.  I
don't want to overplay it or belittle it, but we needed some time to
get that worked out.

    "Less than two weeks before the trial [on Nov. 20], the government
added new names to the list that were not mentioned in the indictment
as well as filed a motion to withdraw one of the original names
mentioned," Guidoboni said.  "I wanted time to look into that."

    In opposition to the motion for a continuance, government lawyers
said that the national security issues raised in the CIPA motion were
being resolved and would have no effect on the defense's ability to
proceed or on the timing of the trial.

    Responding to the issue of not having responded in a timely manner
to the defense's requests for a list of victims or witnesses it
intended to call, "the government has complied with all court orders
to provide discovery," said Mark Rasch, trial attorney for the Justice
Department.  In addition, the defense has had ample opportunity to
request and receive additional information related to the case, he
said.

    The government is seeking in a motion to remove the U.S. Air Force
Logistics Command at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton Ohio,
from a list of four sites mentioned in the jury indictment as having
been allegedly hit by the worm.

    Rasch declined to comment on why the government wishes to remove
this particular site from its list of victims, while adding that it
intended to offer evidence on 16 sites in all.

    Guidoboni filed an objection to that motion last week, and a
decision is pending.

    Last week, U.S. District Judge Howard Munson agreed to continue
the case to the week of Jan. 8.  A new trial date has not been set.
