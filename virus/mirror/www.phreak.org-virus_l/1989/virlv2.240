The disagreement results from our different understanding of the words
"very sophisticated virus." I understood them in a relative sense,
meaning that a "very sophisticated virus" in the PC environment does
not have to be nearly as complicated or large as a "very sophisticated
virus" in the UNIX environment, and therefore much easier to write.
So, we really do not disagree regarding the fact that

No, because a part of the "survival" is to avoid detection. Many
protection program simply hook interrupts, and any virus that bypasses
the interrupt table has a good chance of avoiding them altogether.

Subject: Ohio vs. Den Zuk (PC)

It is obvious that the "Den Zuk" and "Ohio" viruses are somehow related,
but the nature of their relationship has not been determined yet. "Ohio"
was reported later, but there is a possibility that it is older than
"Den Zuk".

I said in an earlier note that a diskette infected with Ohio would be
immune to infections by Brain and Den Zuk. This is not entirely
correct. The diskette will be immune to infections by Brain, but when
Den Zuk finds a "Ohio"-infected diskette, it will remove the virus and
put a copy of itself there instead.

As I have mentioned before, the "Ohio" virus contains the signature of
the "Den Zuk", but it also contains some interesting text strings:

                      V  I  R  U  S
                           b y
                       The Hackers
                       Y C 1 E R P
                      D E N Z U K O
                      Bandung 40254
                        Indonesia

                (C) 1988, The Hackers Team....

Remember that Den Zuk puts the volume label Y.C.1.E.R.P on
Brain-infected diskettes, when it removes the infection.

(And yes, by the way, both viruses only infect diskettes, not hard
disks).

The "Den Zuk" virus contains the following text strings:

                        Welcome to the
                           C l u b
                        --The HackerS--
                            Hackin'
                         All The Time

                         The HackerS

On a more technical level, the viruses are very close. Both store the main
part of the virus on track 40, starting at sector 33. (Remember that normal
360K diskettes have only tracks numbered 0..39 and sectors 1..9) They also
hook INT 9, take action when Ctrl-Alt-Del is pressed and in both cases
a true reboot can be produced by pressing Ctrl-Alt-F5.

And of course - the "Ohio" virus has the same "bug" as "Den Zuk" - it can
not infect other types of diskettes than 360K properly.

A part of the "Den Zuk" virus may explain the relationship. The following
code fragment is used to determine if a diskette should be infected or not.

    CMP    [SIGN1],537CH        ; Is current diskette infected
                    ; with this version of Den Zuk ?
    JE    BP0300            ; Yes, do not infect.
    CMP    [SIGN2],0FAFAH        ; No, but is it infected with
                    ; (probably) an older version ?
    JE    BP0280            ; Yes, update the virus.
    CMP    [SIGN3],1234H        ; No, but is it infected with Brain ?
    JNE    BP0290            ; Yes, remove it.
                    ; No, just infect.

"Ohio" contains the signature FAFA in the specified location.

My theory is that the "Ohio" virus is the missing "older version" of
"Den Zuk", that it was written by the same authors as "Den Zuk", but
earlier. The authors of Ohio released it to fight the Brain virus, but
since it contained a number of bugs, the "Den Zuk" virus was later
released to track it down.

One final question. I understand that a variant of Dutch is spoken in
some parts of Indonesia - do the words "Den Zuk" mean anything over
there ?

Subject: VACSINA infects more than EXE and COM files (PC)

Hi,
VACSINA infects any file that is loaded and executed via the INT 21H(4BH)
function. So additionally to COM and EXE files other files like OVL or
APP are infected as long as they start with E9H (jump) or 'MZ' (EXE header).
We have written a program that detects VACSINA and removes it from those
files. Also we have an immuniser that prevents VACSINA from installing its
memory resident copy.

The usual idea is that you boot from a known-safe *diskette* when
you want to get the system into a clean state for checking.  With
enough effort, it's possible to get a diskette whose possibility
of being infected is as small as you like; if you boot from that,
you can check your hard disk without having to assume that it's
clean already (when a machine boots from a properly-prepared
diskette, as you know, no code from the hard disk is executed).
That was, I think, what was being suggested in the item

Subject: Another Virus? (PC)

Over the weekend a file named EAGLE.EXE was uploaded to my BBS.
My system run extensive tests on ALL new files before they are
released for general use and downloading. I checked the log and
NO reports of anything you may consider improper were found after
checking the uploads.

EAGLE.EXE is said to produce a VGA animation of an EAGLE flying
in the sky. For those interested in VGA animations it would appear
to be of interest.

I ran EAGLE.EXE and all that happened is the program produced the
following line on the screen:

Kiss an Eagle Today!

Being of suspicious nature, I immediately started to check the file
using SCANV48 and other utilities. No indication of a virus was
detected or reported.

HOWEVER,running certain files after running EAGLE.EXE caused them to
grow in size. Okay, cold booted and ran SCAN and other utilities again.
Same result, no report of infection. But as soon as you run EAGLE.EXE
again, files start to get larger.

There has been NO apparent FAT TABLE damage, and no files have
suddenly disappeared. Other than files growing in size, there appears
to be nothing else happening yet!

The file EAGLE.EXE probably has been or will be uploaded to Homebase
by the time you read this message. If not, it will transfered tonight
as soon as we can get through.

NOTE:    SOURCER  reveals code similar to other viruses in existance,
but I will defer to experts and let them decide what exactly is
contained in the EAGLE.EXE file. In all likelihood this IS NOT a
new virus, just a modification on an old one, however again I will
defer to the experts!

SUSPECT FILE NAME: EAGLE.EXE
     DESCRIPTION : Supposedly a VGA animation of an EAGLE.


DISCLAIMER:

    This virus (or whatever you want to call it) HAS NOT affected
any computers or files at this University. It was discovered on a BBS
run by a student who attends this University.

Subject: Undecidability of virus detection

In VIRUS-L Digest   Thursday,  9 Nov 1989    Volume 2 : Issue 237,
Peter Day writes

    `A note to the virus-l digest of 6-Nov-89 said that "the virus
    problem (at least detection anyway) is undecidable."  Does
    anyone know if there are any papers where this result is
    proved? Or where the problem is shown to not be NP complete?
    Or even where the problem is stated precisely?'

There are two parts to this question.  First, precisely what is a
virus and second, how hard is it computationally to determine whether
a candidate program contains a virus.  Precise specification of
viruses is an open-ended discussion, but almost any reasonable
definition will lead to the same conclusion.  For the sake of this
discussion, let's agree that a virus modifies something it shouldn't.
(A program which makes undesired modifications does not necessarily
contain a virus, but all viruses make undesired modifications.)

Determining whether a program makes undesired modifications is
equivalent to determining whether it ever computes a particular
result, which is equivalent to the halting problem.  Hence
determination of the presence of a virus is undecidable.  This is not
a formal proof, of course, but a student in a first course in formal
systems ought to be able to supply the necessary framework and details.


Undecidability is unfortunate, but not the end of the world.
Approximate virus detectors are entirely feasible.  The undecidability
result simply guarantees that any detector must err sometimes.  It may
err by failing to find some viruses, or it may err by falsely finding
viruses where they aren't.  (Or it can hang up in a loop and never
terminate.)  Most virus-finding programs in use today err on the side
of missing some viruses.  Maria Pozzo and I are conducting research
along the alternate line.  (See our paper in the 1989 IEEE Symposium
on Security and Privacy, Oakland, CA, if you want further details.)

 A program called XTREE.EXE is suspect in spreading a very annoying
virus.  A friend used this program and was consequently infected.  The
first time he ran the program the computer simply locked up.  He then
re-booted and got the following message - YOUR PC IS STONED !
LEGALIZE MARIJUANA!

 I have not been able to examine the infected disks personally so the
information that I have is just what I have been told.  The Virus
causes many READ/WRITE errors and does spread to floppies.  It has
apparently infected COMMAND.COM and the BOOT area of the disk,

 The real nasty part is that the chap who has been hit is pretty new
to MS-DOS machines.  In fact he barely has the system set up at all.

 If anyone has had experience with this VIRUS I would thank you for any
advise.

I AGREE....  All virus elimination programs MUST be seen and BE above

see a "elimination" program for Juruselem that says all is fine, But
the scan program still says t hat it is infected.  Which is right.
Both came from the same source.  (McAffee Associates)

I am not perfect in my software, But two programs that test for the

Subject: Sunday virus (PC)

The "Sunday" virus reported here recently seems to be little more than a
variant of the Israeli/Jerusalem virus.

There are some differences - the length of Israeli/Jerusalem is 1808 bytes,
but "Sunday" is only 1631 bytes long. Jerusalem defines INT 21 subfunction
E0 to check if it is installed, but Sunday uses subfunction FF.

It is, however, so similar to the original virus, that the only modification
I had to make to my virus removal program to cover "Sunday" was to change
one line in the "remove_israeli_or_fu_manchu" procedure:

        if (virlen == 1808)
to
        if (virlen == 1808 || virlen == 1631)

No other changes needed, not even new signature strings.

This means that we only have 39 different viruses to worry about, not 40. :-)

Anyhow - it is always getting harder and harder to determine what is a new
virus and what is just a variant. Viruses Like "Ghost" and "Mix1" that
combine parts of two viruses are not making that job easier...!

Subject: Lisbon virus (PC)

The "Lisbon" virus reported recently is nothing but a variant of the
Vienna virus. The major difference is that the virus seems to have been
created from the disassembly in Ralf Burger's book "Computer Viruses..."
and assembled using a different assembler than the one used to create the
original virus.

The "Lisbon" virus contains the patches added in the book to make the
virus a little less harmful than the original, just like the "Ghost"
virus I reported recently.

The reason I say that the virus has been created using a different assembler
is that in many cases different forms of the same instructions are used.
It is a rather little known fact that many x86 instructions have two
different forms, in particular the XOR instructions. For example, the
"XOR AX,AX" instruction can both be represented as

        31 C0   or   33 C0

The Microsoft assembler will generate one of the forms, but DEBUG the
other one. I don't know about TASM and other assemblers, I use MASM
and DEBUG for everything :-)

Since Lisbon contains the form not used by the original virus, it was
obviously not created by patching of Vienna. Still, this small difference
was enough to confuse both the scanning programs from IBM and McAfee,
but not my own....... :-)

There are a few differences in the code, but they are trivial.

Subject: Ralf Burger's book

I spent a part of last evening reading the book "Computer Viruses, a
high-tech disease".  This book has been mentioned here several times
before, in most cases because it contains a (slightly crippled)
disassembly of the Vienna virus.

This disassembly, and other that have been (and will be) made
generally available will become a major source of problems in the
future. The reason is quite simple. It takes a GOOD assembly language
programmer at least a couple of days to write and debug an original
virus. Given a disassembly to start from, he can complete the job in a
few hours instead. A novice may spend a bit longer time creating a new
virus built on a disassembly, but it will be MUCH harder for him to
write a new virus from scratch. It takes no genius to write a virus,
only an experienced assembly language programmer, but since the
novices outnumber the experienced ones, the availability of a virus
disassembly will result in a far greater number of people being able
to write viruses with less effort.

My opinion of the book is very simple.

I can not recommend it. This is not due to the fact that it contains
listings of "real" viruses, but rather that the information in the
book is inaccurate and out of date.

Consider for example the different virus types described. They are:

        Overwriting viruses.
    Non-overwriting viruses.
    Memory-resident viruses.
    Calling viruses.
    Hardware viruses.
    Buffered viruses.
    "Live and Die" viruses.
    "Hide and Seek" viruses.

Boot sector viruses are not mentioned in this list, or anywhere else
in the book. This is of course because they only appeared in 1988, but
the book was written in 1987. Some of the virus types mentioned are
unknown and VERY unlikely to appear at all.

Some time is spent on the subject of "Randomly occurring viruses"...

    "who can say that his software cannot be turned into a virus by
     changing a single bit ?".

... and that sort of stuff.

Still, this book is l lot better than the two other books I saw here
at the university bookstore. I guess we will never get a "good" book
on viruses, since they will probably have become obsolete by the time
they appear.

But who needs a book when we have VIRUS-L and comp/virus ?  :-)
