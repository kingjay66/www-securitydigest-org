Subject: Virus Archives
 
I noticed several postings regarding archives concerning different
viruses.  I got the ftp addr for the Macintosh virus archives but
can't locate the information for the other archives.  Is this
information stored somewhere?  I would like to get the archives.
Thanks.

Subject: New Version of VIRUSCAN
 
The new version V26 of VIRUSCAN can now identify the FuManchu and the
Traceback (3066) viruses.  No reports of the 3066 in the States yet,
but sure to come.  The new version is available on HomeBase - 408 988
4004.

# Introduction to the Anti-viral archives...
# Listing of 14 July 1989
 
This posting is the introduction to the "official" anti-viral archives
of virus-l/comp.virus.  With the generous cooperation of many sites
throughout the world, we are attempting to make available to all
the most recent news and programs for dealing with the virus problem.
Currently we have sites for Amiga, Apple II, Atari ST, IBMPC and
Macintosh microcomputers, as well as sites carrying research papers
and reports of general interest.  We don't yet have a site dedicated
to the "big boys", but are on the look.  Volunteers welcome.
 
If you have general questions regarding the archives, you can send
them to this list or to me.  I'll do my best to help.  If you have
an archive site and would like to volunteer your site (and are in
a position to do so! :-), send me a message.  Also, if you have a
submission for the archives, you can send it to me or to one of the
persons in charge of the relevant sites.
 
I have completed my research here at Iowa State and will soon be
moving on.  I'll keep the list updated as to my whereabouts.
(I *do* plan on having net access at my next job! :-)
 
This round of announcements introduces Simtel to the IBMPC side
of our archives.  With the mail-based service many other sites provide
for the Simtel archives, this should provide access to the archives
to many "Bitnet-bound" folks out there.
 
If you have any corrections to the lists, please let me know.
It appears I completely fumbled the Mac listings last time.  The
list should be correct now.

Subject: New additions to Amiga archives
 
 
 
It's about time I posted an announcement of some of the anti-viral
programs I've collected for the Amiga archives.  To find an archive
site near you, check my earlier posting to this list of all the
archive sites cooperating with virus-l/comp.virus.  Here are a few
of the recent additions.  (However, not all of these are "new"
programs---just programs I've recently found.)
 
bootback.arc
        A program to backup boot blocks.  Includes source.  This
        is worth getting, if only to read the comments in the
        source code.
 
bootune.arc
        The program installs a boot block which plays a tune each
        time you boot.  If the song gets messed up, you should
        suspect something wrong with the boot sector.
 
clkdoct3.arc
        This program will fix the "clock virus".  I'm fairly certain
        there is no such virus, but crashes and errant programs can
        affect the battery backed clock making it stop or run incredibly
        fast.  This program will reset the clock mode.  (AmigaDOS 1.3's
        "setclock" has this feature reset feature built-in.)
 
crc.zoo
        This program will generate CRCs for any number of files,
        or will check the CRCs against a prior list.  The author
        wrote it to verify recoverable RAM drives, disk copies
        and file transfers.  However, it also works well as a virus
        checker.  Includes a utility to generate a list of files
        with full path names.
 
guard.arc
        The guardian is a resident program to check your system
        at reboots.  It is dormant at other times.  Includes a
        version that can be patched into Kickstart.  Subsequent
        releases are commercially available from Transactor.
 
vrstrp.arc
        This program should be included as the first command in
        your startup-sequence.  It simply checks its size, and
        reports any difference.  This will catch any infection
        by the (current) IRQ virus.
 
xboot.zoo
        This program will take a file (assumed to be a capture
        of a boot block) and convert it into an executable program.
        After this, you can use your favorite debugger on the
        virus.

of the recent additions.  (However, not all of these are "new"

bombchek.arc
        2 oldies, plus 2 "new" programs. Includes Chk4Bomb and BombSqad,
        as well as WPHD and FPHD.  The latter two write/format protect
        your hard drive with a TSR.
 
chklharc.arc
        Checks self-extracting LHarchives for potential bombs.  A batch
        file can be included to automatically execute when archive is
        extracted.  Now if that batch file included FORMAT C:...
 
chkup35.arc
        Version 3.5 of CheckUP.  Performs a "randomized" CRC check
        of your files.  If nothing else, get this for the five pounds
        of documentation.  :-)
 
dprot102.arc
        TSR to protect drives.  Update to DProtect.arc.  No source.
 
dvir1701.exe
        Detects and removes the 1701 virus from .COM files.
 
epw.arc
        Password protect executables (?? - no docs).
 
f-prot.arc
        This package includes a LOT of different utilities to aid in
        fighting viruses.  There are programs to check memory, check
        the boot block, check files, lock files, lock drives, etc.
        Also included is a driver to put into your config.sys file.
        This release is a beta-test version.
 
immune.arc
        TSR to protect system from Friday 13th and April 1st viruses.
 
inoculat.arc
        VERY simple protection against Lehigh.
 
md40.arc
        Removes many boot/partition viruses, for DOS 4.0 only.
        Versions available from author for other releases of MSDOS.
 
novirus.arc
        Checks command processor to detect tampering.
 
provecrc.arc
        Demo of CRC checking, showing some "flaws" of the method.
 
sentry02.arc
        Fast CRC program for verifying all of disk.  Reads only a
        "vital" portion of each file to determine its integrity.
 
unvirus.arc
        Repairs files after infections of the Friday 13th, April 1st
        and Ping-Pong viruses.
 
vaci13.arc
        Checksums OS files.
 
vdetect.arc
        Virus detecter tracks all files on disk.
 
virusgrd.arc
        (?? - no docs)
 
viruscan.arc
        Program to scan an entire disk and determine if any files
        are infected with a virus.  This is version 0.3v19, which
        is aware of 19 viruses but still has some bugs.
 
vlist01d.arc
        Well, in spite of the fact that it's not yet "done" I've decided
        to distribute my index of the anti-viral archives.  The file is
        a DeVice Independent (.dvi) file produced as the output of TeX.
        You will need a driver or previewer to use the file.  At the
        moment, the chances of a plain-text version seem slim.  If there
        is demand, I could also make a PostScript version available.
        This version only covers IBMPC programs and IBMPC documents.
        I plan to expand it to Amiga progs/docs and general documents.
