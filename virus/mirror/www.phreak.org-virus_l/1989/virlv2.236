VIRUS-L Digest   Wednesday,  8 Nov 1989    Volume 2 : Issue 236

VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

# Introduction to the Anti-viral archives...
# Listing of 07 November 1989

This posting is the introduction to the "official" anti-viral archives
of virus-l/comp.virus.  With the generous cooperation of many sites
throughout the world, we are attempting to make available to all
the most recent news and programs for dealing with the virus problem.
Currently we have sites for Amiga, Apple II, Atari ST, IBMPC, Macintosh
and Unix computers, as well as sites carrying research papers and
reports of general interest.

If you have general questions regarding the archives, you can send
them to this list or to me.  I'll do my best to help.  If you have a
submission for the archives, you can send it to me or to one of the
persons in charge of the relevant sites.

If you have any corrections to the lists, please let me know.

The files contained on the participating archive sites are provided freely
on an as-is basis.

To the best of our knowledge, all files contained in the archives are either
Public Domain, Freely Redistributable, or Shareware.  If you know of one
that is not, please drop us a line and let us know.

PLEASE NOTE
The Managers of these systems, and the Maintainers of the archives, CAN NOT
and DO NOT guarantee any of these applications for any purpose.  All possible
precautions have been taken to assure you of a safe repository of useful
tools.  Unfortunately, in this day and age nothing is certain.  It is awful
that these people have to worry about legalities when they are only trying
to provide a free and useful service.  But facts are facts.  Your use of
the archives relieves the sites from any liability.

Sigh.

I have uploaded the following files to SIMTEL20:

pd1:<msdos.trojan-pro>
SCANRS48.ARC    Resident program to scan for many viruses
SCANV48.ARC     VirusScan, scans disk files for 48 viruses

SCANRS48 and SCANV48 were downloaded from the Homebase BBS.

Some viruses do this. SysLock, Icelandic and Typo-COM will only infect some
of the programs they have a chance to infect. They use different methods,
like "only every other day" or "only every tenth program run".

Actually very few viruses infect the same "victim" over and over. Some boot
sector viruses do, but the only program virus which does so is the original
version of the Israeli (Jerusalem) virus.

One virus - the "Icelandic" virus - makes an attempt at this. It will not
infect a system if it determines that any program has hooked INT 13. Since
all virus monitoring programs do that, it will not be detected by them.
(In practice this does not work too well, because of a bug in the code..)

>Staying Within Normal System Activity Boundaries.

Most resident viruses do this.

>Hiding From Standard System Utilities.

This is the difficult part. Very few existing viruses are able to do this
properly. Most boot sector viruses will decrease the amount of memory
available - for example turning a 640K machine into a 639K one. Program
viruses can in many cases be detected by using a ordinary memory mapping
utility. Still, quite a few manage to hide even from that, but there is room
for much improvement in this area :-(

>Modifying Hosts To Make Them More Susceptible To Re-Infection.

This brings up the topic of "virus types we have not seen yet". I have
written a document describing a few types of viruses that could theoretically
be written, but are currently unknown. Description of one of the types
follows.

   7) The "AIDS" type. This type of virus is very dangerous. Not because
      it destroys programs or data, but because it attacks the protection
      mechanism in the computer. These viruses can be divided in two
      subgroups.

         Specific:  These viruses will search for known anti-virus programs
                    and disable or destroy them. They might to that by
                    patching the code in memory and then overwriting parts
                    of the protection programs on the disk.

         General:   These viruses must be much more complicated, but they
                    could for example try to determine what programs had
                    hooked a specific interrupt. Then they might modify
                    a few memory locations in order to bypass those programs.

      A virus of this type might not do any further damage, but it would
      leave the system vulnerable to attacks by other viruses, which might
      then have a devastating effect.

I must disagree. In the PC environment it is not a question of limited
resources, but rather the fact that any user process has full access to
ALL resources and can even directly manipulate the hardware if required.
So, my opinion is that it is even easier to write a sophisticated virus on
the PC than in most other environments.

Finally, I want to add one "feature" to the description of a sophisticated
virus:

"Bypass protection programs and jump directly to the hardware, DOS or
BIOS routines."

There are quite a few "filter" programs available that will monitor every
INT 13, INT 21, INT 40.... call and alert the user if an attempt is made
to do an illegal operation. They are, however, almost useless against
viruses that can access the system directly in the way described above.

Only two or three viruses do this now, but I am certain that more virus
writers will figure out how to do this in the future. :-(
