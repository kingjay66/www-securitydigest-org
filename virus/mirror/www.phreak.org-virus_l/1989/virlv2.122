Subject: comp.virus gets undigestified
 
Comp.virus readers will be happy to see that the VIRUS-L digests are
now being undigestified as they get spooled to the usenet newsgroup
comp.virus.  Hopefully, this will make things easier for news users.
 
It also makes the subject line even more important than before, so I'd
like to request everyone's assistance in using informative subject
lines.  Without a good subject line, your message is more likely to be
ignored - particularly by people reading comp.virus.
 
Thanks,
 
Ken

Subject: Mac II virus?
 
I'm not sure I'm having a virus problem, but I wanted to check if
anyone has had similar experiences.
 
After attending a virus seminar, I went back and checked my Mac II,
and noticed that the System file had been modified earlier that day.
I ran Interferon 3.1 and it showed a virus type 003 in my TOPS file.
The Interferon documentation says that virus type 003 is the "SNEAKS"
virus, and that this virus affects the INITs in the System folder.
There are only 6 INITs in my System folder, one for each of the three
TOPS files: TOPS, SOFTTALK, and SPOOL.  EasyAccess has three INITs.  I
ran ResEdit over all the INITs and couldn't find any strings like
"Evil Wizard," or anything else overtly suspicious.
 
Another symptom: I've been running Gatekeeper in Notify Only mode for
the past month, and whenever I bring up the machine, it gives warnings
for SPOOL and TOPS. I've ignored those messages, thinking that TOPS
(and SPOOL) were just performing some misinterpretted, but legal
operation.
 
Anyone having similar experiences?  Am I infected?
 
Thanks.

As I'm sure other folks will point out as well, there are two errors
here.  First, it's not true that "if you do not copy diskettes you do
not have viruses".  Viruses can spread in all sorts of ways, including
buying diskettes with legitimate software on them, getting and running
public domain executable files, and even just from putting a diskette
into an infected machine and doing a DIR on it!
 
Second, it's not true that "diskette copying is a crime".  Some
instances of diskette copying (and file copying) are violations of
copyright laws.  But many are not; many programs are in the public
domain, or may be copied in some circumstances without violating the
license; there are All Sorts of Terms and Conditions out there, and by
no means is "diskette copying" always a "crime".
 
I think it's very (very very) important to keep firmly in mind the
fact that viruses typically spread through legitimate actions by
legitimate users; the myth that viruses are only spread by grubby
criminals and law-breaking teenagers trading pirated software is
potentially a very dangerous one.
 
OBEYING THE LAW DOES NOT MAKE YOU IMMUNE FROM COMPUTER VIRUSES,
and having a virus does not mean that you have broken the law!

The following (long) document is the computer law for the state of
Wisconsin.  Other states have similar laws.  Virus writing is against
the law if damage occurs.  The penalty is proportional to the amount
of damage.

Hm.  That's the place where the Yale/Alameda virus stores the original
boot record.  Perhaps you have a variant of that virus that does the
screen effect?  Are there any speaker noises (like the 17xx virus
produces), or little bouncing balls on the screen?  Or do letters just
get blanked out?

Could someone send me an updated copy of the "DIRTY DOZEN", PLEASE.
The most recent version I have is dated 2/21/88. I am JJMC @ LEHIGH.
Thank you very much. I really appreciate it.
