Subject: Sun security problem: restore
 
A security hole has been found in SunOS restore.  This problem affects
SunOS 4.0, 4.0.1, and 4.0.3 systems.  It does not appear in SunOS 3.5.
The problem occurs because restore is setuid to root.  Without going
into details, is sufficient to say that this is a serious hole.  All
SunOS 4.0 installations should install this workaround.  Note that a
user does need to have an existing account to exploit this hole.
 
There are two workarounds that will fix the problem.  The first is
slightly more secure but has some side-effects.
 
1) Make restore non-setuid by becoming root and doing a
chmod 750 /usr/etc/restore
 
This makes restore non-setuid and unreadable and unexecutable by
ordinary users.
 
Making restore non-setuid affects the restore command using a remote
tape drive.  You will no longer be able to run a restore from another
machine as an ordinary user; instead, you'll have be root to do so.
(The reason for this is that the remote tape drive daemon on the
machine with the tape drive expects a request on a TCP privileged
port.  Under SunOS, you can't get a privileged port unless you are
root.  By making restore non-setuid, when you run restore and request
a remote tape drive, restore won't be able to get a privileged port,
so the remote tape drive daemon won't talk to it.)
 
2) If you do need to have some users run restore from remote tape
drives without being root, you can use the following workaround.
 
cd /usr/etc
chgrp operator restore
chmod 4550 restore
 
This allows the use of restore by some trusted group.  In this case,
we used the group 'operator', but you may substitute any other group
that you trust with access to the tape drive.  Thus, restore is still
setuid and vulnerable, but only to the people in the trusted group.
 
The 4550 makes restore readable and executable by the group you
specified, and unreadable by everyone else.
 
Sun knows about this problem (Sun Bug 1019265) and will put in a more
permanent fix in a future release of SunOS.

Your description of the VNET topology is essentially correct.   On the
other hand, I *don't* think it's the case that the backbone was taken
down at any time during the CHRISTMA incident.  As I say, I was on
vacation, but I think the response at most of the central nodes was
to run a filter; hastier reactions (shutting down, cold-starting, etc)
would have been more likely to have happened at "leaf" nodes, where
the operators were perhaps less experienced.
 
Just because the media like the "IBM's network was shut down" story,
don't assume it's true...    *8)

Subject: viruscan source (PC)
 
I am offering my BBS as another source for Viruscan.  I currently have v29,
which was downloaded DIRECTLY from the HOMEBASE BBS.  The file name is
SCANV29.ZIP.  You will need the latest version of PKUNZIP.EXE to extract
it.  Normally, new users on the BBS are not allowed to download until they
have been registered. However, to gain immediate access to this file, use
the following login:  First name:  VIRUSL
                      Last  name:  BITNET
                      Password  :  SCAN
 
This will give each caller 30 minutes to download this file.  Other
badware-related files are listed in the VIR files directory. The BBS uses
RBBS format commands.
 
Two nodes are available. If another caller is using the special login above
on the other node, use the first name  VIRUSL2 as an alternate with the same
last name and password.
 
The phone numbers and parameters are as follows:
 
       714-856-7996   300-9600 baud (HST) N81  -- 24 hrs
       714-856-5087   300-1200 baud  N81       -- Evenings & weekends
 
The BBS is located at the Biomedical Library, University of California,
Irvine, California, U.S.A.

Subject: Request for comments on anti-viral software (PC)
 
I have just tested a few 'old' anti-viral software and would like to
have your comments on the following findings (hopefully answers for
the questions as well) :
 
1) SERUM.COM (236 bytes)
   -- This is a TSR program which removes (c)Brain from RAM as well as
      floppy diskettes. However, it does not work on an AT machine. The
      program claims to remove the virus from the infected disk and change
      the disk's label to 'cured'. But when I tested it, the disk was changed
      to the word 'Sidsoft' instead. Does anyone know what's wrong?
2) KILLPP.EXE (40533 bytes)
   -- This program is able to detect and eradicte the Ping-Pong virus I
      have. However, it only replaces the boot sector with the original
      boot record. The bad sectors remain and hence the viral code still
      exits on the disk. Is that all it does?
3) NOBRAIN.EXE
   -- This is another program for removing (c)Brain from diskettes. However
      it only works well for diskettes which are formatted using IBM DOS.
 
Thanks in adance for all your help and time.
