[Ed. This is the first digest being sent out from here at CMU, where
I'm using a different mail system (MH) than we used at Lehigh (RMAIL).
I hope that things will work ok, but please bear with us if we have
any problems.]

This is a short description of the files I have collected so far
for the virus-l/comp.virus anti-viral archives.  Please note that
in the listing of "viruses known", I'm only copying what is in the
documentation for the program.  It is very likely that many of
these will detect more than just the listed viruses.
 
Also, I may have opinions on these programs, but I'm not giving
them here.  I give no guarantees for any of these --- I just
want to make it available.

In article <0005.8906291152.AA13476@spot.CC.Lehigh.EDU> you write:

Thanks for spotting this.  I'll verify it and correct my listings.
If only nameservers really worked, I wouldn't even have to list
IP numbers!  :-)

Subject: on the recent BYTE virus article
 
On the BYTE article with my byline on it.  Let's just say that the
BYTE staff are very creative in their editting and their copyed
procedures.  Although I was shown a proof of an earlier revision of
what they did, they opted to run an article I never saw.  Portions of
that article I did *not* write.  In particular, the tail of the
article (the "The Sky Is Falling!" silly stuff) came out of some
editor's keyboard, not mine.  They softened the technical side of the
article beyond belief ("An Interrupt Vector? Why would an interrupt
care about direction and magnitude? We'll change that to something
else.....Hey! Does anybody know anything about computers?").
 
Sigh.
 
Well, my complaints went up to the editor, Fred Langa, and I can but
hope that future writers for them would be pleased at the resulting
article with their name attached to it.  I specifically am displeased
at the mush article they had the nerve to print with my name atached
to it.
 
The Real Moral: Writer's articles get screwed around, even at what
used to be considered a fine publication.  Argggh!

You could, but it wouldn't help you any. What nVIR 10 does is act as a
switch to the nVIR virus to tell it not to propagate. It doesn't really
do anything else, and it won't help against any other virus. nVIR only
looks at the System folder to see if nVIR 10 is there; it doesn't look
at other files.
 
I'll check into some things I have, and post back if I find anything that
will work with the old System. Could you please drop me a note and let me
know exactly what version you're running? Thanks.

P.S. If I come up with anything, I'll be sure to post it on our LISTSERV
and will send it to sumex, too.
