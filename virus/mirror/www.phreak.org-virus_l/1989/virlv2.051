The MIT report on last November's Internet worm is available for
anonymous FTP from pine.circa.ufl.edu (128.227.128.55).  If you are on
SURANET this will probably be faster than other sites.

Virus Rx is picking up INIT 10s.  It says that there is "no known
problem", and most of these are INITs (superclock among others).

Is this a problem?  Should I worry?

Subject:    New anti-virus group: CoTRA

The latest issue of New Scientist (Vol 121, No 1652) contains a news
article entitled 'Virus vigilantes' reporting on the formation of a
new group of software companies and users, called the Computer Threat
Research Association (CoTRA). This group intends to "research,
analyse, publicise and find solutions to threats to the integrity and
reliability of computer systems".

The group is to be based initially in Britain, but hopes to build
links with Europe and the rest of the world.

Can anybody out there expand on this?

Subject:  Flu_Shot 1.51 now available

Flu_Shot + ver 1.51 is now available from RAMNET BBS. I got my copy in
the mail because I was a registered user of FSP+ 1.4.

FSP+ v1.51 (and v1.5) doesn't do the CMOS check any more hence that
sometimes annoying message "CMOS has changed" doesn't pop up from time
to time. It also has a -W command line option which prevents it from
triggering every time a file is opened with write access. It still
protects files from being written to however! According to the update
posted int the FSP_151 archive some *NASTY* bugs in v 1.4 and earlier
have been fixed, so v1.4 users please take note.

I also tested v1.51 for the"print.com-TSR" problem reported in an
earlier issue of this digest. As long as you register print.com as a
TSR with the T option in the FSP.DAT file, FSP+ 1.51 *DOES NOT* flag
print.com as an UNAUTHORIZED TSR.  (I think the message was referring
to v 1.5 which I have *NOT* tested. Also, print.com does TSR after it
has initially been loaded into memory)
