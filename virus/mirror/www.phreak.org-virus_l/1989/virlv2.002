I saw this on the Security discussion group and thought that it might
be an interesting topic to talk about here:

  Hello.  I was just at what was called an "emergency breifing" on
viruses.  The person who conducted the breifing is quite well known
for his work in the area of viruses and computer security.  His name
is Dr. Fred Cohen.  This was a very interesting meeting.  One thing
that surprised me is that public domain software is a smaller source
of viruses than proprietary software which comes in those nice shrink
wrapped packages.  Since there is no regulartory agency whose job it
is to certify software and it's potential for harboring viruses and
legitimate bugs, proprietary software becomes just as easy to infect
at the publishing house as any of your own disks.

  It also seems that few unversities or other institutions of higher
education admit to viruses being a major problem.  I don't know of any
courses offered in the subject of computer security and virus
detection.  Are there any at your school?

  A question of relevance to this discussion is along the following
lines.  Is it not the ethical responsibility of our government to
establish laws and guidelines which software must pass before being
distributed?  I know that the government has guidelines for itself
about the integrity of software for it's internal systems.  What about
for consumers in general?  We have laws regulating production of
auto's and other consume products and services.  The same should be
true of software.  There should be some sort of committee made up of
individuals from government and private industry who are responsible
for certifying software.  For gosh sakes, even floppy disks must under
some sort of certification!  It's kind of silly to certify the
integrety of floppy disks when we are allowed to purchase disks with
software that might very well have a virus due to the lack of
regulations and standards in this area.

In addition to my having been out over the holidays, we've been having
some LISTSERV problems here which have been delaying VIRUS-L delivery.
Right now, there are a couple of digests waiting to be delivered...

Sorry for the delays.  Hopefully things will get fixed and production
will resume...  In the meantime, feel free to send in any submissions;
they will be included in a digest and the digests will be sent out as
soon as things are back up and running.
