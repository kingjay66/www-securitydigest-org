Subject: PLO virus
 
 
In my travels I ran across several systems which were infected quite
heavily with a virus that flushot 1.6 identified as the PLO virus (aka
the Jerusalem or israeli virus).  It appeared that the infected files
grew by about 1.8K each time they were infected.  Some files had been
infected 40 or more times.  It did not appear that the virus infected
either the command.com or the two system files, however it did attack
anyother executable .com or .exe file.  I also noticed that the virus
seems to go TSR and conflicts a small section of video memory on highly
infected machines.  Using PC tools I was able to search for the
ascii string "sumsdos" which seems to be in all of the infections.
 
The suggested solution for right now was to boot the system off of a
write protected floppy disk then delete all of the files that the
infection was found in.  Just as an added precaution when the infected
files had all been erased, the hard drive was optimized which would
overwrite any sections of the disk where any of the deleted files had
resided.  With any luck this will inhibit the reoccurance of the virus.
 
Does anyone out there have any experience dealing with the PLO virus?
As always with the unknown I'm alittle concerned that I might have
missed something.  Has anyone taken the time to un-assemble the PLO
virus to determine eaxctly what it does?  I would also like to know what
other people have used as a prescribed procedure for dealing with this
virus and if there is a program out there that will cutout the infected
code.

With regard to FLU_SHOT+'s message on "An attempt is being made to infect
your system with the Cascade Virus":
 
FLU_SHOT+ looks for attempts by a program to use the "new" interrupts
viruses like the Cascade (1701) virus use.  It assumes that any such program
is probably a virus, although in reality it might be another anti-virus
program.
 
Sorry for the confusion, but I figured better safe than sorry.

howdy,
 
I would like to submit the following as an update to my previous article
concerning a prob. scanning multiple disks on Drive A:, while running
DOS 2.11.
 
Recently i experimented with VIRUSCAN by scanning multiple diskettes in
Drive B: with the same DOS version. The scan.exe program worked just FINE.
 
   REgards, RollO~~

The new version of viruscan is now available through the anti-viral
archives.  Note that this version is called SCANV26.ARC, and replaces
the old versions of VIRUSCAN.ARC.  Check an archive site near you.
(You do save those listings of archive sites, don't you? :-)

Can anyone suggest some good virus checkers for MSDOS.  PD preferable,
non-tsr.  Do not have access to FPT but can Bitnet of call a BBS.
