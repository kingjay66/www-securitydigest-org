Subject:      Re: Booting process (PC)

     I recently tried to boot an executable but non bootable
disk I received from Germany.  I recieved the usual 'non system
disk, hit any key to continue' message IN GERMAN.  Clearly
the disk was read first and my pc which was booted from its usual
English hard disk knew something was up in the german disk.
Thus floppies are read before they are rejected as non bootable.

I think we are all (well, almost all) tired of the disk drive
discussion, informative as it was.  I would like to suggest the
formation of another list, say, HARware SECurity List, where things of
this nature could be posted.  Readers: What do you think?  Send SHORT
responses here, long ones and flames to me direct.  If it is
warrented, I will summarize.
