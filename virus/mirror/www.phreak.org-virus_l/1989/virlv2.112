        In reference to the SYS command, I'd like to point out that
for some boot viruses we have to precede the use of SYS with the
Norton Disk Doctor 4.5 "Make Disk Bootable" option.  Notably some
versions of the Ping Pong virus will not succumb to SYS alone.  The
instruction list we provide to infected sites is very long and it's
difficult to encapsulate it into a message for a forum such as this,
so it is easy for people to misunderstand or misinterpret global
statements that Mr. McAfee is prone to make.  He is correct that the
SYS always works.  He did not go into detail on preparations for its
use.

I don't read this list much, so this might have been mentioned
already...
 
Somebody suggested the possibility of a "useful" virus, which could go
around and destroy other, harmful viruses, but which itself has no
negative effects.  These are used in the real world, but one objection
is the worry that a programmer who "thinks" there are no harmful
effects might be wrong, and once the genie is out of the bottle,
there's no putting it back.
 
Well, there is.  Biological types often "key" their creations with
certain properties specifically for identification and eventual
destruction.  For instance, a virus might be created which can only
survive in a potassium-rich environment.  The idea is that if it ever
gets out of the test tube, it'll die before it can do any damage.
Another property you can give a virus is a sort of "back door" to
killing it -- squirt manganese at it or something.  This is especially
applicable to benevolent computer creations: you can deliberately code
in an easy way to kill the thing, such as the presence of a file with
a certain name, or a certain magic number in a cookie someplace in
RAM.
 
My point is that there *are* safeguards against accidental
contamination and ways to make a program deliberately killable.

Summary:  Do NOT use this program. It is buggy, does things you would not
          expect a "nice" program to do, and despite the claims in the
          documentation, provides NO protection against viruses.

Subject: More caveats on SecureInit (Mac)
 
Recently there was a message on this list concerning 'SecureInit' for
the Mac, which stated:
 
>SecureInit installs some invisible inits in my
>System Folder.  Why not make them visible, and let the user decide on
>visibility/invisibilty (there are a wide variety of utilities that let
>you do this).
 
I thought that the Mac OS never runs invisible INITs?  In any case,
why have them invisible since the INITs are only hidden from the user,
not other programs!  All in all, this behaviour sounds more like that
of a virus than a security program!
