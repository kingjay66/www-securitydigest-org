Subject:      Removal of Details on the Recent Virus at Purdue

In yesterday's (11/11) NEW YORK TIMES, p. 12, there is an article titled
"U.S. is Moving to Restrict Access To Facts About Computer Virus." It
describes how the National Computer Security Center, a division of the
National Security Agency, requested that Purdue University remove detailed
information on the recent virus from university computers. The university
complied. The article goes on to describe the debate over this action
(rather considerable, as you might imagine). The article leaves open
the possibility that sother sites may have received similiar requests.
Two questions: (1) what was the NCSC concerned about? (2) have others
been contacted?

can I have an update on which version(s) of flushot are known/
suspected of being bad ?

with my customary efficiency I've flushed all the flushot
messages 3 or 4 days before someone comes in with a possible
virus problem

Yes, but some people see these  folks as  intelligent  people who have
simply been turning to the   dark side  of the  force.  I  think  it's
better to  put them on  the side  of good than  to let them perpetuate
their  crimes/annoyances.  I think  the feeling is along the  lines of
"They know too  much already  and we'd better have  them on our side."
Or, in other  words, "If  he can do it,  he can help us prevent others
from doing it (or similar things) again."  Sure, none of this prevents
the person from continuing  his activities  on the inside.  Obviously,
those who hire such people feel confident that there  is no risk of it
continuing.

The sure way to determine if your sendmail is subject to this security
hole is to try it yourself.  It is frighteningly easy.  On
questionable unix machine 'phubar' do [machine responses prefixed by
">"]:

telnet phubar 25
>Trying...
>Connected to ll-vlsi.arpa.
>Escape character is '^]'.
>220 phubar Sendmail 5.51/3.2.sst.ll ready at Mon, 14 Nov 88 12:26:21 EST
helo phubar
>250 phubar.cc.hehigh.edu Hello phubar, pleased to meet you
debug
>500 Debug set

If the respose to the 'debug' command is 'Debug set', you are wide
open!  The response should be something like 'Command unrecognized' if
you are safe.  End the telnet session with 'quit'.

I would disable sendmail until you get it fixed.  Even if you didn't
get hit by the recent virus, there are now thousands of curious
hackers out there just itching to try out this newly publicized
security hole.

There are various fixes available on the net, but basically what you
need to do is with adb or emacs or whatever editor you use for binary
files, change the string 'debug' to something else -- 'showq' is
suggested, since that is a valid SMTP command.

Good luck.
