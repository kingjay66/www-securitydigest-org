I think that one has to keep in mind the *KEY* difference between
a micro environment (DOS, OS/2, etc.) and a mainframe (MVS, CMS,
VMS, UNIX, etc.) is that the mainframe OS is immune to direct
attack (OS kernel is protected, OS files are protected, user
files are not).

Viral attack requires modification of executables (per the
definition of a virus). If *ONLY* authorized programs (linkers)
running from protected (read-only) filespace can write or modify
an executable, then the low-grade user vector for the virus is
stopped cold.  The only path to infection is a super-user running
an infected program; an authorized virus can nullify protection
of executable files... A much smaller and harder window for a
virus to get through. The only other loop-holes to plug would be
file rename (to executable name), file copy/restore - the same
protection criteria could be applied to file system utilities as
you require of Linkers (authorized, protected filespace).

It would only take small mods to existing mainframe security
systems implement the above protection systems. The same hooks
and exits used by the security systems can be used by a anti-
virus developer to protect just executables if a site doesn't
want to pay for a complete security system (cost in $$$ and
overheads).

Since the mainframe OS is better protected, other loop-holes are
harder to find for the virus-writer. And once protected, the
mainframe will tend to stay safe.

I *REALLY* think that mainframe protection development is trivial
compared to trying to protect a micro; when you stopper up the
many guage 0 holes, there are thousands of size 00, millions of
000...

For the PC just a couple of non-trivial changes could make the
environment much easier to protect:

    -   external switch to protect boot partition on HD (IBM,
        clone-makers, disk sub-system people are you listening?)

    -   all executable files encrypted on disk (with DES or even
        a simpler algorithm), file decrypted by loader, key
        specified by user at boot through keyboard or ???.
        Encrypt by linker or conversion utility (after power off
        restart!)

Excuse me Loren, but you're on a MUSIC/SP system, not a VM system.
MUSIC/SP runs as a disconnected virtual machine under VM/CMS, and
its disk structure bears very little resemblence (sp?) to VM/CMS.
Also, the terminal program, PCWS, was written by McGill University,
not Clarkson.

Ken,

I really wish you wouldn't make statements like "You are not using
this or that program" unless you really know what I'm using.  I
am not discussing PCWS from McGill.  I was playing with another
program to emulate 3270's terminals on another machine.

Actually though, I do want to correct one thing.  I don't believe
the program I'm using is sanctioned by Clarkson, looking at it,
it may just be written by someone there.

Subject:      The Conference...


Okay,

We're ready to tell you about the computer virus conference coming
up!


      THE COMPUTER VIRUS AND SYSTEM SECURITY CONFERENCE

We will be holding the first Computer Virus and System Security
Conference at Lehigh University in the Lehigh Valley, Pa.
(Bethlehem, Allentown area) on October 21, 22 and 23 (a Friday,
Saturday, and Sunday).  Because specific rooms are still under
discussion, we cannot give you a precise schedule of events.
The cost will be $50.00.  This includes entrance to the conference
and all discussions.


Preliminary Schedule:
--------------------

The following is a VERY tentative schedule.  It will be altered as we
get nearer to the conference date.  We are juggling large rooms,
including a very large hall for round table discussions and several
large auditoriums.  We'll have a better idea of exactly how the
conference will be set up within two weeks.  We'll need more information
on exactly how many people will be attending the conferences and an
exact list of speakers.  We have several people who have tentatively
said yes to speaking at the conference and we'll be contacting others
over the next week.  We expect additions to this schedule, and will post
them as we get them.  We already have a good group of people working on
the conference, so it should go over quite well.  I'd also like to thank
Craig Pepmiller for his suggestions.

Fri, Oct. 21:   1:00 PM -  2:30 PM  What is a Virus?  A seminar,
                                    including demos of several
                                    viruses on various systems.
                                    These will be WELL contained.
                2:45 PM -  3:15 PM  Introductions (Guests can
                                    introduce themselves to each
                                    other in a lounge area).  Coffee,

One question, Loren, about the conference:

  Is the $50 going to be worth the price for the people who get the
Virus List (and don't want to hear a re-hash of everything said here a
thousand times over) or is it going to have fresh, new input and
ideas?  Also, Who are the speakers going to be??? It seems that reading
through old virus lists might contain more information than having
ANYONE talk about the subjects...

Here's an idea:  Have bound copies of the old virus list logs available
(to buy?!?) so that people can gain some more knowledge through them..

Once again, these are my ideas and are not usually accepted by others..
If you wish to complain, fine; everyone else does.

Subject:      Encryption


   I think J. W. Crooks idea of executable file encryption is a nice
idea if the encryption/de-encryption process could be protected.  I was
thinking along the same lines myself but I didn't bring it up (and I may
be wrong!) because I didn't think it was a practical or defensible scheme.
If you use the same encryption algorithm with a built-in key for every
encryption/de-encryption, then a virus has only to locate that segment of
the program which does that and use it.  If you use the same algorithm
everytime, but always query the user for the key, then even if the virus
knows the algorithm, it can't make use of it because it lacks the key.
However, just because you don't store the key on disk somewhere doesn't
make it safe, even if the algorithm is a good one.  The de-encryption
program file must be vulnerable because it must be available at startup
(or you can't run any programs at all!) and therefore must be sitting there
unencrypted on your disk.  A virus could infect the de-encryption program
(e.g. the loader program) (say when you run some trojan horse program) and
then just wait until you run your next program which will require the
loader to query for the key (unless the loader only queries for the key once
(at boot), and then the key is just sitting there in memory, waiting to be
snatched).  Whatever the senario, whether the virus steals the key from the
deencryption program as it runs or directly from the user or from memory
or whatever, the key clearly has to be around to be stolen whenever you run
a program.  With the key in its possession, the virus knows how to read any
of your other programs, including the encryption program (if it isn't
already sitting there unencrypted on your disk).  Now all it has to do to
infect your programs is to de-encrypt them, alter their code and then
re-encrypt.  It certainly makes life harder for the virus, but I'm not sure
if it offers a significantly increased level of security compared to the
price you have to pay (the complication of encryption, and then there's the
added hazard of what to do if you forget the key...), unless you can make it
harder for the virus to get at the encryption/de-encryption process.  On the
other hand, just because a scheme can be foiled doesn't mean that it is of no
value.  I think an invincible protection scheme will never exist, but we may
find a scheme which will never let any viruses through.

In Fred Cohen's dissertation, he talks about using RSA public key encryption
combined with checksum (or CRC) signatures to protect files from alteration.
Specifically, use the RSA encryption to encrypt a file, then discard the
private key thereby making the encryption process one way, perform a checksum
of the resulting encrypted file, and store that checksum on disk.  It is
then easy to validate the signature, but next to impossible to reverse
engineer the checksum, particularly if you use long encryption keys.  The
problem with this method is that there is relatively considerable overhead
involved in the authentication process.  If, however, you only perform
the authentication process periodically, it could be a viable file
protection scheme; at least it should be able to detect unauthorized
file modifications with a high degree of certainty.

The RSA public key encryption, by the way, uses two encryption keys - one
for encryption and one for decryption.  Figuring out one from the other
would be extremely difficult.

Right.  Which means that someone has to execute the bacterium for it
to propogate.

Even REXX programs don't jump up and start executing all by themselves.
PROFILEs (similar to PCs' AUTOEXEC.BATs) could be thought of that way,
but those are actually called by someone (CMS or XEDIT) and can be overridden.

The CHRISTMA EXEC would never have gotten out of node 1 without someone
executing it.  Just having it won't spread it.

Perhaps you could restate your point in case I missed it...

Subject:      AT configuration

I wonder what would be the effect of telling my AT, through some
configuration changes that I have no hard disk.

I can run a program that permits me to tell the battery operated RAM
package that I have one of 45 or so different hard disks, or by
putting a zero in some location tell it that I have no hard disk.  Can
a virus guess what sort of disk I have?  What would happen if the
virus guesses wrong?

Interested in some feedback here.

Certainly within one of 45 or so tries...  :-)

>What would happen if the

If the virus (or any program) only tries to read the disk while it's
set to be the wrong type, no harm should happen (well, the seek motor
might not like life too much if you try to go to, for example, cylinder
800 when you only have 619).  If the virus writes while set up wrong,
it's highly likely that you'd be spending some time in the not too
distant future reloading your hard drive.

What would be the advantage(s) of doing that, though?  To test to see
if a program contains a virus before trusting it on your hard drive?
Ok, that could be of limited utility.  Bear in mind, however, that it
would be painless for a virus to (purposely) not do any damage, or even
try to propogate, if there is no hard drive present.  Also, chances are
pretty good that a virus wouldn't try to assume that you have a hard disk
if DOS says that there is none present - it would be shooting into the
dark so to speak.

Try running FluShot+ 1.2 on your AT computer and then you will know what
it is like to have your CMOS setup corrupted so that DOS (or a virus)
can't find any fixed drive!

I think it would be difficult for a virus writer to experiment
setting different fixed drive types in your CMOS hoping to get some fixed
drive available.  Would the virus writer not be safer by checking for the
fixed drive first? (on an AT: in the CMOS); then if one exists, attack it.
Otherwise, his/her virus might end of with "drive not found" type errors.

Subject:      Conference

Amanda, the letter you sent to Virus-L did not get to me,
I just got the header.  If it was important, could you
resend it?

David Bader:  We have discussed (dare I say it?) very little
on this list.  The basic purpose of the conference is for
people to get together and discuss viruses among themselves,
show each other what they've come up with in terms of
viral protection and what problems they've had.  These sorts
of conferences are generally very successful in that they
produce some very useful ideas.

David, we have touched very little on Worm Process propogation,
or limited functionality (Fred Cohen's idea), limited transitivity
(which has been around for a while), bottom-up system usage,
and various theories of security or anti-viral protection.
We have simply discussed CRC systems, DER encryption schemes,
and various viruses.  I believe a conference can produce a lot
more than short letters back and forth.

I got quite a few replies to my VM system comments.  Again,
I am sorry, but I am not quite used to VM yet and am not
that good with it.  I also do not have a system account and
have very limited access, so its hard for me to proceed,
unlike other machines I've worked on.  Over the next few
weeks, hopefully, I will have something more substantial
worked out and will describe possible infiltration methods.

One of the comments I received was something like:
"If you have to execute the Rexx program to propogate the
virus, it is a bacterium."

No, I was not talking about a program which is a virus, I
am talking about inserting a few lines of viral code into
someone else's Rexx program.  Sure ALL viruses have to
be run to propogate, the difference between a bacterium and
a virus (as it was explained to me recently) is that a
bacterium IS a program and a virus places itself into a
REAL program of the users.

Thank you for all your VM suggestions by the way, and
incidently, if, for some reason, I sounded like I disliked
DER encryption, that is certainly not true, it is very
good.  I also am a big fan of forcing the user to put
in a key.

Subject:      Conference AGAIN

Alright David,

Since you have asked, I may as well reply here.  He wanted to
know what the 50 bucks was for.

Because we will (as it looks now) have a large group of
experts and amateurs showing up, we will need to rent
room space.  This costs money.  Several people have also
suggested coffee and donuts or cookies at the conference
and its a good idea.  About half the people who wrote in
wanted some sort of magazine/book written for the occation
to include some speaches and some papers.  We'd also
like to make certain papers available to the people.  One
of the bigger expenses is flying in good speakers, people
who have dealt with viruses and security problems for some
time.  Rather than have just anyone talk about subjects
(which I'm sure everyone can read books and tell us what
they read), we'd really like to have the people who've
worked on viruses and propogation theories.

However, I am still in the process of trying to contact
people from "Computers and Security" magazine and others.

I hope people are interested in this conference, we've
gotten a ton of mail on it.  I believe it will be fun,
educational, and hopefully will bring something out
of it.

Thank you,

Loren Keim

One of the problems that a designer of a virus must solve is how to get
his program executed.  One of the easiest solutions to this problem is
to get the the victim to invoke it.  There are a number of ways to do
that.  One of them is to simply invite him to do so.  Another is to give
the program an attractive name.  This is called "bait."

A second problem is to get the copy propagated to a new execution
environment.  This is trivial in VM since, by default, all virtual
machines are connected in a virtual network.

Note that if I can dupe "A" into executing the virus, and if that causes
a copy of the virus to be sent to "B," the virus will appear to "B" to
have originated with "A."  If, as is likely, "B" knows and trusts "A,"
then that trust will be conferred on the virus.  This makes it easier to
dupe "B" into executing it.

The defenses suggested by Hank are useful.  However, in order to be
completely effective, they must be observed by most of the users within
the community.  The virus only has to dupe some of the users in order to
prosper;  it need not dupe all.  Note that the virus usually appears to
have come from a known and trusted source.

Fred Cohen has demonstrated that in a population of hundreds of users,
the virus can propagate to every user within a matter of hours.

Incidentally, you should read his papers.  It would save a lot of
needless speculation about things that he has already demonstrated.

One other point that should be made in the context of network viruses,
is that the perpetrator can potentially benefit himself.

Viruses in the PC world are merely destructive.  They can be employed in
the furtherance of vengeance, but they are less useful in satisfying
greed.  Not so in the network; in addition to replicating itself, the
virus can send information back to its originator. (Of course this
requires that it contain information about its origins; this increases
risk for its perpetrator.)

Subject:      REXX


Those of you who are on BITNET probably use REXX even if you are not
aware of it.  Some of the rest of you may not know what it is.

REXX is a command language and interpreter.  It is sufficiently rich
that almost any thing can be written in it.  Its power is extended by
its ability to invoke and use commands, other REXX procedures, pipes,
filters, programmable editors and formatters, and even other application
programs.

REXX language interpreters exist for CMS, TSO, and PC DOS .  IBM has
committed to produce such interpreters for most of their operating
systems.  Thus, we have the potential for a virus with a wide range of
potential targets.

In this context, it should be noted that REXX scripts are interpreted
rather than executed.  However, it can invoke things which are executed.
It can, for example, invoke "copy."  It can name parts of itself, and
thus address them.  If it knows its own name, a condition easily met,
then it can address itself.  On the other hand, if it does not know its
own name, a condition equally easily met, then it will have difficulty
addressing itself.

It should also be noted that, since much of the power comes from the
ability to employ things in its environment, it is not totally
environment independent.  Since commands and naming conventions vary
from environment to environment, it is difficult to write a REXX script
that will run across environments.

Nonetheless, the power of REXX greatly reduces the work factor that a
virus designer confronts.  (I once wrote a very powerful Trojan Horse
that required only two lines of REXX.  I wrote it in one half hour even
though it was the first REXX procedure that I had ever written.  All the
knowledge and information that I needed was available on line in the
form of HELP and models.)

Loren,
   Then why don't we discuss these topics on the list, instead of
re-hashing all these "trivial" problems.  Why do some people need to
travel hundreds of miles to discuss the problems that this list can

If anyone really wants to hear about limited transitivity
theory, I will put some up, but the problem is that this
list (correct me if I'm wrong Ken) is for discussion, not
for me to lecture to people or anyone else to.  Generally,
if you want to learn about various subjects, get articles
on them, there are many published.

Problems sometimes result from the fact that their are some
people on this list (William Murray, Joseph Beckman and others)
who truely do know something about viruses and security
problems, and there are others who really don't.  I
think its often hard to discuss things.

One of the things I like the most about having a virus conference
is that we will be given the chance to exchange ideas and if anyone
wants to learn something, its much easier to discuss ideas and
theories isn person rather than over a list.

If anyone feels that I am totally incorrect in that feeling,
feel free to tell me.

There's nothing wrong with presenting an overview of such topics, and
of course, subsequently leaving them open for other discussions.
Also, it's quite acceptable to give an overview and refer the readers
to specific books/articles, etc.

I agree; I think that everyone who is truly interested in the subject
should at least read Dr. Cohen's dissertation.

The issues here are generality and transitivity.  Systems in which a
user can both write and execute an arbitrary program, are more
vulneralble than those in which the user is limited to the use of
programs of managements choice.  (Almost all readers of this forum will
recognize the former; they may not recognize the latter, but this class
includes application machines, servers, ATMs and arcade games.)

Transitivity can be defined as the potential for data to become
procedure (or, if you like, program.)  One man's data is another man's
program.  However, almost all systems today support the ability to interpret
command  language scripts (e.g., CMS EXECs, TSO CLists, Unix shell files, PC
DOS batch files, etc.)  Thus, we go back to generality, i.e., is the
capability made available.

In the current issue of "Computers and Security," Fred Cohen argues
that, in the face of viruses, we must be prepared to restrict sharing,
transitivity and generality.  I concur.

Although I find much of the material interesting, it's not very helpful to

into our VAX/VMS system over BITNET.  If anyone has any ideas on how I might
better secure our facility here.

Surely one of the nicest things about a list like this is
precisely that there *are* both knowledgeable people and
not-yet-knowledgeable people, and the former can give
information and advice to the latter?  If you know things
about (for instance) the limiting of transitivity that
you think many of the rest of us don't know, you shouldn't
hesitate to tell us.   Doesn't need to be a lecture, of
course.   Could just be "Here's a two-paragraph summary,
a practical example, and an article to read for more
detail".   I think that'd benefit many/all of us...

  Well, yes.  You can install drivers via config.sys.  Usually they are RAM

Subject:      Protecting Command.com

Here are some suggestions for protecting yourself from a command.com
virus:

Floppy disk based systems:
  (1)  Make a copy of your original system disk and put a write protect
       tab on it.  Boot from that disk only and don't have a system on
       any other disk that you use in your system.  (Make several copies
       of this disk, of course.)

Hard disk systems:
  These are more vulnerable because you have to have command.com        le
available on the disk and the disk cannot be write protected because
its the one you are using actively, so:

  (1)  Rename command.com to some other name which is meaningful only to
       you.  Don't tell anyone else what that name is.  (Keep the .com
       extension.)
  (2)  Modify IO.SYS (or IBMIO.SYS) by replacing the string COMMAND.COM with
       the new name which you have chosen.  Use a seven character name
       because I'm not sure what would happen if you tried to shorten
       the length of the string.
  (3)  Add to CONFIG.SYS the line
       shell=d:\command.com
  (4)  Add to CONFIG.SYS the 'device=' line to create a ram disk large
       enough to hold command.com.  (3) above assumes that that will    ome
       become drive D.
  (5)  Add to your autoexec.bat the line
         copy ugh.com d:command.com
       (replace ugh.com by the name you have chosen for your secret copy
       of command.com.)

  Now, if someone infects command.com, it will be the copy in ram disk  nd
and not your permanent copy and the infected copy will go away when you oot
re-boot the system, even if you just do a warm boot.

  Of course, a clever virus could read your config.sys and your autoexec.bat
and . . . . . ;  BUT, you have the upper hand (I hope) because you have
been able to boot with a clean copy of command.com and a clean (I hope) copy
of autoexec.  Your autoexec can do CRC's and such to protect itself and your
your hidden copy of command.com.

  For those who doubt that this will work:  I have tried it and, if     YS
the file name in IO.SYS is changed (with Norton Utilities or Debug),
it will use the re-named copy of command.com with no complaints.        ts.

  I would welcome any comments about hidden pitfalls in this approach.

  By the way, one benefit is that, with command.com in ram, you will    oke
invoke it faster at job end and when your program does a push to DOS.

Hello all

I was wondering if someone could send me a list of all the known computer
diseases and define some of the terminology used when describing the
diseases.  I am writing a paper on computer viruses and I would like to
include a definitions section.  Due to the fact I am Kind of a beginner
at using computers, I don't know some of the terms used.

Thanks in advance.

Subject:      Re: command.com

After reading Art Larky's message on command.com, I felt that I must also
share how I have been protecting my computer against the dreaded Command.com
strain of viruses.  Like A.L.'s protection scheme, my method does almost
the same effect by renaming and copying files.  Here is what happens each time
my computer boots:  (the autoexec dealing with virus protection )

  1)  Config.sys creates a 384K Ram disk

  2)  CHECKUP 1.4 is used to monitor the fingerprint of Command.com by
      copying its image from a subdirectory into the root and comparing
      Command.com with the image.

  3)  Copy Command.com to the RAM disk and set it write protected on both the
      Hard drive and the ram disk

  4)  Set COMSPEC = E:(ramdisk)\COMMAND.COM

  5)  And finally, I have Flushot plus 1.4 (kind of) working to consistently
      check my CRCs of important files (Command.com, io.sys, msdos.sys,etc.)

 I figure that if I am infected by a virus, my hard disk's Command.com will be
 infected, and on my next bootup, I will know about it and automatically
 replace the corrupted file. Since my COMSPEC is pointing to my RAM disk's
 Command.com, I will have no problems in that "infection" session of spreading
 the virus.

 If my Command.com that is on my RAM disk is infected, SO WHAT??? It will be
 replaced on my next bootup and won't be able to spread.

 I guess anyone writing a virus has it one step easier now knowing various
 user's configurations and trying to find the holes in our thinking. But
 I feel that the more protection schemes used and spread across the world-
 wide computing systems, the less the chance of any virus propagating.

Agreed - I think that we could further the aims of this list if
there was a compiled bibliography of "Computer Virology". In fact
I'd be willing to compile one for submission to Ken van Wyk to be
put up as a listserv file, if all you VIRUS-L'ers will send

Discuss already - the novices will just have to read the message
logs and literature references to get up to speed. Discuss the
*REAL* issues and problems at hand on the list. That is one of
the known problems of discussion lists; some noise in the signal.

I agree that face-to-face discussion is "easier" than phone or
message, but some of us who won't be able to get to the
conference have to make do with what is available.

Subject:      COMMAND.COM and viruses

Two people have recently mentioned how they protect COMMAND.COM from
infection by virus. While their system may (and may not) protect them against
today's viruses, they are not a significant barrier to even fairly "stupid"
viruses.

First of all, running your CLI out of a ramdisk is not going to fool most
viruses. Unfortunately, MS-DOS makes it easy for viruses to spot what is
most likely to be your real CLI- C:\COMMAND.COM

It would probably protect you much more to partition your disk so that
you have a 1 MB C: partition and the rest of your disk in D:.  Boot up with
the COMSPEC set to D:COMMAND.COM. This will give better results.

Of course, while experts can get their disk to have any name they like,
most users will always be running out of the C: device. Too bad. File
systems with named devices would eliminate this problem. (Mac HFS, for example)

Secondly, this again brings up the topic of disguised viruses. Someone (Art
Lakey?) said that a virus would not be likely to use device drivers as a
vector since he would notice the difference. In fact, this is one of the more
trivial types of disguise a virus might use- just make sure that any
references to the CONFIG.SYS file don't show the line, make sure updates don't
clobber the line, and hide the driver in the way discussed in my previous
article on camouflaged viruses.

Actually, that's not so trivial... but compared to some of the horror-story
viruses being discussed recently, it's pretty tame.

Hello there,

Reading the mail in the list teaches me a lot. I live far away so
no chance that I come to the conference. Starting to keep subjects
out of range for this list - save them for the conference - will
harm these that will not go there.

It will be nice to know that subjects raised in the conference -
will be summerized here.

To the discussion started by Loren K Keim - It is important to read
summerized 'lectures' as well as techniques to prevent viruses :
mixing theory with practice.

No, because every REXX program knows its own name by means of the
PARSE SOURCE statement.

Btw, every REXX program knows its own source code by means of the
sourceline function, which makes virus-writing easier.

Yes, and to the extend that the very statements a bacterium or virus
would use to propagate (e.g. COPYFILE) are *not* part of the REXX
language (at least not of every implementation) but rather of the
environment.  Regrettably, this constraint is relaxed by two mechanisms:
1. every REXX program knows the environment it's running in (PARSE
   SOURCE and PARSE VERSION);
2. REXX can be used to program the XEDIT editor (available on CMS and
   PC -- I don't know about TSO/E) which constitutes a much more
   versatile and compatible environment.

Great idea!  I've had a number of requests for good references and
where to get them.  It would be very worthwhile having a bibliography
(of sorts) here on the LISTSERV.  Jim, send me what you have, and I'll
put it up.  Thanks!

Recently on this list, some people have advocated that in general the
members of this list should go out and read some references. Agreed,
but where are they? I believe someone came up with the idea of making
a VIRUS-L bibliography, an idea I laud, however, I have noticed that
certain people even when they do give references (which is almost never)
do not give complete or correct references. As to Mr. Cohen's dissertation,
I recently called USC and tried to get a copy of it, and I was told that
the author had pulled it from circulation, apparently so he could
publish a book. I would like to borrow someones copy to read, since I am
sure the book will be out RSN. A final request, could someone send me
information on how to subscribe to Computers and Security.

That was just my point.  At least for the next little while, we can
expect that virus codes will not look for hard disks on systems that

My suggestion was to get rid of C:\COMMAND.COM entirely by
re-naming the file to something personal (LEHIGH7.COM, for
example) and changing the name in IO.SYS.  Then the only
place where the file exists as COMMAND.COM is on ram disk.
The virus will have no problem finding it there since that
is what comspec will point to; however, that's an expendible
version.  Of course, the virus could look in IO.SYS for the
real name, but it has to do that after boot-up and after
the clean command.com and autoexec have had a chance to run
and look for trouble.  Hopefully, the virus will be content
to feast on easier pickings!

I believe that it's even easier than that; you can put a
SHELL=C:\LEHIGH7.COM statement in your CONFIG.SYS file.  Of course, a
virus *could* parse the CONFIG.SYS for a SHELL statement...

True, I guess I feel better having the file name buried in autoexec,
particularly since I could have autoexec execute some program with
an innocuous name that, in fact, was copying my 'LEHIGH7.COM' to ram
under the command.com name.  Now the virus has to examine everything
that autoexec executes looking for my copy program.  I could encode
the file names in that program so they would not be recognizable
and could not be parsed by the virus.  As I said before, go pick on
a smaller guy, Mr Virus.

I truly do not understand how you can use autoexec.bat for protection.
That program gets run very late in the boot process.  As I understand
it, the boot examines config.sys to see what is to be established as a
part of the io and msdos resident portions of the code, and only then
brings up command.com (or its alias) and finally after command.com is
loaded, it is executed with autoexec running as the first job.

For *most* Command.com viruses, isn't it better to get rid of the virus
as soon as possible (using autoexec.bat techniques such as Art Larky and I
have suggested) than not protecting in such a manner at all?  The less time
the virus is around, the better a computer's chances for survival, I think.
Mr. Levine: What method do you use in protecting from this strain of virus?

  I'm assuming that you have been able to defend yourself enough so
that you are starting out with a clean copy of the re-named
command.com and have not yet been infected.  Then everything is under
your control through the boot process and you are working with a
benign, healthy, un-adulterated command.com.  If you have checked
and medically certified your autoexec.bat, then you are starting
up your system cleanly.  Autoexec can contain the code to make the
temporary copy of command.com in ram disk (from hidden sources and
using encripted file names) and can run your CRC checkers and set
up Flushot or whatever to watch over what you do after that.

  If, despite your precautions, command.com gets infected, its the
only the ram copy and that goes away when you reboot.

  If you want to be safe truly, don't let anyone near your machine
and don't ever run anyone else's software or anyone else's disks.

  What I hope I am suggesting is a method of making infecting
my command.com hard enough that the virus will not get a good
toe-hold on my system.

  Keep the comments coming - as long as I can argue them down,
we have a viable possibility for protection.

Subject:      System Generality

Since it was brought up,

Computer Generality basically means that a computer is
designed for one function, unlike an IBM PC which can
be used for many many functions.

Fred Cohen has stated in the past that we should limit
a machine's usefulness in order to prevent viral spread.
I'm not sure that is the answer.

Agreed that if a computer cannot produce multiple functions,
its very difficult, if not impossible, to propogate a virus
through that particular system.

Unfortunately, the machines that are most at risk from damage
from computer viruses are government computers, banking
computers and so on.  If we make these machines specific to
a purpose (ie: have a database program in ROM and allow no
other program to run), then we limit our ability to climb
the technological ladder.  As we design faster and better
systems, we have to replace everything we have.  If we
do not have these machines as specific purpose machines,
then they are still in almost as great a risk group as
before.

For the many, many people who sent me letters asking if

I will try to compile copies of all the speaches made at
this conference and have someone take notes on panel
discussions.  We will then make this available to those
who cannot make the meeting.  The book which we will be
distributing at the conference will also be available.
We will probably charge for the book, to handle printing
costs and shipping costs, but I think it will be well
worth it.

Incidently, we've had a lot of talk about protecting command.
com on MS-DOS micros.

And we've had quite a few good comments.  One thing I should
point out though is that command.com viruses are a small
portion of the types of viruses out there that hide themselves
in the boot sector, Bios, Io, executables, command files, in
memory, and even between sectors (theoretical, I haven't
seen one myself).  Protecting command.com helps to protect
your system, but the system must be protected as a whole,
which is more difficult.

What reasons do you have that banks and government systems are more
infested with viruses??? Although it must be a hard statistic to find,
since most humans don't know what a computer virus is even if it were to
kill their main-frame or PC, I would think that the major virus attack
is on such computers as PC labs, university systems, (and other "public
sites" that can't monitor most users of the system.)  On a banking
system, for all our monies sake, I would hope that 1) only authorized
administrators use the computer, and 2) none of them want to kill their
bank's files.  (The ssame reasoning goes with the government.)

David,

I have never seen a computer defined as a box that can perform
various functions.  A computer can do one specific function
without being a paperweight.  Have you ever seen a calculator?
Have you seen a television?  In a way, each of these is a computer
and each has a specific function.

What I said in my letter, paraphrasing Fred Cohen, is that
if we make computers perform one specific function (like
a computer to open doors for us when we approach, or a
computer to cook our food in the microwave) then it does
not have a serious problem with viruses.  If we limit
the functionality of a computer, we limit the approach,
or the infectibility of a computer.  Unfortunately, it
also means that we may need more equipment to do something.

I also never stated that government and bank computers
were more infected than other computers, nor that they
were more at risk of being infected.  They DO however,
often have the most to lose.  I believe I also added
a "so on" onto the end of that.  What I was saying is
that we have to protect our "secure systems" (I'm
sure most of you have heard the term before).

Viruses have been able to do what other programs cannot,
they sidestep security by entering a computer by way
of an authorized user who doesn't realize that he or
she is carrying the virus.

It doesn't matter much if a college LAN loses all its
information (unless someone stores important research
on that LAN), but it is critical if a large banking
institution loses all its records (which happened
recently), or if NASA loses the program which runs
the spaceshuttle just as its blasting off.

This is absolutely irrelevant.  Few people PURPOSELY infect
their computer systems.  How many of us go around injecting
bad programs into our own important files?  That is rediculous!
When someone's disk is infected by a virus, they generally
don't know it.  They spread the virus to their company's
files accidently, they don't realize that they are carrying
something deadly to their records.

I agree that a calculator is a computer, and it can perform various
functions... It CAN also have I/O lines (such as to printers or input
tape or something like that.)  Also, If in one of your previous
messages you said that theoretically viruses can hide in between disk
sectors, why can't they hide in the memory of a simple calculator...
Maybe 2 + 2 *does* equal 5 on a corrupt calculator!!! Also, isn't a
"computer" as we call it (like a PC or a mainframe) just a glorified
calculator.  The center of a computer's functioning is its ALU, and
that is just the same as a calculator, just on a different scale.
As for a TV being a limited function computer, so is the human body for
that reason! You have input, output, conversions inbetween... I don't
think resorting to a TV is a good example though of a single function
computer since ANYTHING we name can be a one function computer!

Don't we already have these things?? How about at security doors where
you need to punch in a code to open the door? That is a computer there,
or most microwave are digital making them computers of sort.. My point
is that when we talk viruses, we usually mean "computers" on one-level
deeper, but ANY one-function computer can get a virus if the correct
input is applied.

Why do banking systems and government systems have the most to lose??
EVERYONE has a lot to lose. Any PC has a lot to use, and I would bet
that the storage on PC systems totalled in the country (all kinds of
media) is far greater than the banking and government systems.  Also
add in the universities and public areas of computers; they, too, have
a *lot* to lose.

While this is true and I agree with the statement, also remember that
many systems crash because of inexperienced users with the
authorization.  I think most will agree that the person who has no idea
how to use a system can do the most damage!

Why do you assume that a LAN will have backup, but large banking
institutions and NASA don't?? A LAN might have just as much information
that changes daily, only less humans are involved when the data is
corrupted.  In a large banking institution, I would assume that and
data corruption umbrellas down into a few hundred thousand customers.

This is not absolutely irrelevant. A lot of time bombs (and conceivably
virus-type time bombs) have been left in systems by disgruntled
workers, or system programmers who want an insurance that a company
will pay for the software, or as a means of assuring that the system
won't be given to anyone else.  If you consult the National Security of
Computers (?) department under the Department of Defense, I am sure
that they will have a lot of cases to share with you.

From:         Loren K Keim   -- Lehigh University <LKK0@LEHIGH>
Subject:      Limited Functionality

The first computer virus, Robert, according to Fred Cohen
was done at a computer security meeting in 1983.  (I think
it was October, but I am not 100% certain of that).  However,
the Navy had been working with virus-like programs for
a long time before that.  As one member of this list mentioned
to me before, there were writings on viruses as far back as
the 40's.

As for Limited Functionality, since there is still a problem
with it, I will define it one last time, and I will define
it slowly.

A virus cannot infiltrate a good computer system that is
completely isolated if it does not already have one built
in to the software that it came with.  When I mean isolated,
I mean we can use NO other software on it other than that
which it came with, and have no modem, nothing connected
to it.  It is isolated.  It has been proven over and
over again... a virus cannot infect this machine, because
there is no way for a virus to enter it.

The government back in the 70's came up with a whole slew
of ideas about isolating computers, but a computer cannot
easily be completely isolated.  So they came up with
two alternatives:  Limit the access to the machine as completely
as possible, or Limit the functionality of the computer.

What they meant by Limit the Functionality of the computer,
later redone by Fred Cohen, was that if a computer had all
its programs BUILT IN to the computer, and if it could not
run an outside program, and if it had some specific function.
Then there really isn't a way for a computer to enter the
system.  Memory is reserved for data.  A special bank is
for the program and that is unable to be written to.

In later talks, Fred Cohen described computers which were
designed for special purposes, like opening doors for
people and feeding the fish.  If there isn't anything connected
to these computers, ie: no I/O ports and no outside access,
then there really is no way for a virus to enter.  Likewise,
its pretty hard for a virus to propogate if it doesn't have
a lot of similar connected boxes.

> Don't we already have these things??  How about security
> doors where you need to punch in a code to open the
> door?

Yes, we do.  And you have just fried your own theories.  You
stated that viruses could propogate across single function
boxes, and then you say that these boxes exist.  Isn't
there a security system around?  Yes, there is.  Have you
ever seen a virus attack one?

I haven't.

Also, yes a single-function computer MAY be able to "get"
a virus, but its not good for spreading viruses.  Many single
function boxes which are unlike are VERY hard to write ANY
virus for.  By this point, we would have made it so difficult
to write a virus that one could not easily exist.

> Why do banking systems and government systems have the most
> to lose??  EVERYONE has a lot to lose.

Again, I never said that banking systems and government systems
ALONE had the most to lose.  I said that it would be very dangerous
for these and LIKE systems to be destroyed.  If a major bank
lost all its records.  WE would be in trouble.  Our economy
may feel the damage.  If the government's nuclear device-controlling
computer was set off by a virus... WE would all be in trouble.

This is much more serious than YOU losing a few games and a
research paper for one of your professors, don't you think?

> Why do you assume that a LAN will have backup, but large
> banking institutions and NASA don't?

Nowhere did I say anything about backup.  Quit putting words
in my mouth.  That is wonderful to fuel an argument, but we're
trying to have rational discussions, not scream at each other.

Backups are, as always, important.  One problem we've run
across is a virus that will delete all the files on a system,
but before doing this, it lies in weight for several months.
When you load the last system, it destroys this as well because
its after a certain date.  People don't quite understand, so
they load the second oldest, which they lost also.  By this
point they get the picture, fix the problem when they load
the next time... but its too late... we've lost 2 months
worth of work.

Backups are NECESSARY though.

Loren, I sense some unnecessary antagonism here. Without putting
words in your mouth, it appeared to me the concept of limited
functionality was adequitely understood, I believe its utility as
a practical solution to infection was being questioned. Certainly
it follows that if a system accepts no input, and originally
contains no contaminated code it will not acquire any, it really
doesn't require much 'proof'.

Limiting functionality would seem to simplify management of the
dedicated machine, but, I believe in most instances the utility
of such an arrangement would be in its interconnectivity to other
specialized processors. This connectivity or network could be viewed
as, and is in fact becoming, a 'virtual computer' in its own right,
with all the attendent complexities of a general purpose system.

Has anyone explored the concept of expert systems regulating security?
Perhaps implemented like regression testing in software engineering,
i.e. it familiarizes itself with the 'typical' activity of a system...
quantitatively e.g. avg disk writes for program 'x', free memory,
non-data sector reads/writes, maybe feature analysis techniques,
suspending activity in anomalous situations: Threshold for disk writes
exceeds typical average: memory map =.... continue Y or N, Attempted
write to .COM or .EXE file continue Y or N, programmed in ROM and
supplied as a plug in board? Who knows, just free falling to explore
different directions and maybe trigger other associations.

Subject:      Limited functionality, definition of 'computer', etc.

I'm a little concerned about butting into an argument that seems to be
getting personal, but here goes... (I don't know _anybody_ on this list
personally, so I'm not taking any sides...)

David Bader's most recent lengthy article made many statements. I disagree
with every one. Maybe he had a bad day (I know I'm having one), but I'll
try to go over a couple that seemed to stand out.

First, David asks how to define a computer, and why the definition of Limited
Functionality is useful (I'm paraphrasing, so if I read it wrong, sorry...).

In general, and without getting into any CS theory, I would say that a useful
definition of 'computer' would be the turing machine. Modify that by looking
at the PCs, Macs, Vaxen, and 4381s of today for a more bounded but useful
definition. This is not what you would call a strict definition, but it's
useful because we all understand it. In particular, a calculator or television
don't qualify as (general-purpose) computers for obvious reasons.

On the other hand, there are limited-functionality machines. Another intuitive
definition is useful here: they are machines which, whatever the underlying
capabilities of the component hardware, are NOT turing machines. Two good
examples- 1) a security device, as described in David's article. It does not
have a general-purpose CPU. It is inherently incapable of many things, such
as arithmetic.  2) A building-directory computer. It is based (for example)
on a 68000 machine, with lots of ROM and almost no RAM. While the hardware is,
inherently, a turing machine, this actualization will never be capable of
adding two numbers, either.

Both of the limited-functionality devices described have the same chance of
being infected by a virus: none. It's just not possible. This directly contra-
dicts David's statement "ANY one-function computer can get a virus if the
correct input is applied."

On another topic, while novice users can be dangerous, there is no way a
novice, no matter how clumsy or careless, can cause your data to become
corrupt a month after his/her use of the machine, after the backups have
been contaminated... Novices are also incapable of inflicting serious damage
on mainframes or minis (or PCs with protection in the OS).

Fianlly, it is always the institutions with the most at stake that have the
most to lose (simple truism). What some people fail to see is that banks,
defense systems, and the like, are the most likely to draw sophisticated
viral attacks. While I'm not hugely fond of Cyberpunk stuff, read Gibson's
Neuromancer. I hate to say it, but Gibson is probably very accurate in his
portrayal of what computer security is going to be like in the not-too-
distant future (although I have my doubts about his "Cyberspace matrix").
If you're a crack programmer worth $250 an hour, are you going to spend a
month writing a virus to bring down a campus LAN? Or are you going to write
one that redirects funds from bank networks to a numbered bank account?
The other thing that people forget is that the real viruses of tomorrow won't
be acts of vandalism, mostly. They'll have a purpose.

Sorry for rambling, but it's 5:30 AM... I sure hope this makes as much sense
tomorrow as it does now :-)

Subject:      The First Virus

Quite a few people wrote to me to tell me that I was incorrect
in my definition of the first virus.  That there have been viruses
around for years.  I quite agree.

What I meant was that Fred Cohen, in his famous article describing
viruses back in Computers and Security (No 6, 1987?) he told us
that the first virus was conceived "of as an experiment to be
presented at a weekly seminar on scomputer security" on November
3, 1983.  He goes on to explain how this was the first virus
and the very first virus experiment.

I disagree with Fred on many point, and this is a maojor one.

If anyone has had experience with viruses before this point
in time, I would be VERYa happy to hear about them.  I've
documented a few minor comments in the past, but nothing
concreit with the exception of some government work studying
poropogating programs.

Also, I'm looking for a copy of "Communications of ACM" from
way back in March, 1982.  Pages 172-180 contain information
about the Xerox Worm program which got out of hand a few years
back.

Subject:      Limited Functionality

Granted, limited functionality can certainly reduce the risk of a machine
being infected by a virus.  I wouldn't go so far as to say eliminate the risk,
though.  At least in the case of a machine in which a CPU is getting
instructions from ROM.  After all, where did the instructions for the ROM come
from?  Unless you can insure that the ROM itself is free from contamination,
then you cannot say that there is no virus in that machine.  At some point,
the ROM had to be written to.  It is true, however, that an existing
uninfected ROM device cannot be written to by a virus, assuming that the ROM
is, indeed, unwritable.

Nonetheless, such a limited functionality machine certainly does have limited
application, as the name would imply.  An arcade video game is a good example
of one.  There aren't too many applications in which a limited functionality
machine would be too useful, or at least practical.  I certainly wouldn't want
all of the applications on my PC burned into ROM, never to be altered.  It
would make life on the computer very difficult.

But of course, a virus that did that would not be very clever would it?
A truly clever virus attempts to exploit similarities among its
potential targets.  The beauty of your scheme is that it makes you just
sufficiently different from your peers to remove you from the target
population.  Viruses exploit similarity; they do not need to attempt to
accomdate themselves to differences.  If you are the only target, any
Trojan Horse attack will do.  A virus is redundant.  If you are not the
specific target, then the success of the virus does not depend upon
infecting you.  All of those who have not taken steps to remove
themselves from the target population, are sufficient.  The virus does
not need you.

Thus, to F. Cohen's list of sharing, generality, and transitivity, we
can add "similarity."

I have a simple question regarding viruses in between disk sectors.
I can play arount with all the timing and sector markings in between disk
sectors with my Central Point Options board.  I know how to make copy
protections with this, and other little tricks.  What would the theory be
behind putting a virus in between sectors?  (Anything is possible, I am just
curious on how that would make viruses any different or any other spew about
a virus like that. Also, how would virus detection have to change?)

I am having trouble getting log8805. Your list server has confirmed that

Joe and Loren!

My mail to you doesn't seem to get through, so I will put this on Virus-l

Joe, you say that you have tracked down several viruses. As I say in
my inquiry, I am not interested in *where* it happened, but *what*
happened, what it did, how you found it and restored the machine, etc.
I will be quite satisfied with a couple of lines describing the major
events. Details are interesting, but not really necessary, if you aren't
in your best writing mood. If you don't think this means leaking too much
information, then please tell me! Refer to the different
companies/universities as company A, university B, and so on, if you
don't want their names to be known.

I am interested in information about the Innoculator. If you have a
brochure describing it, please send me one. If you can't e-mail it,
please telefax it to +46 8 7490594. The reason is that the surface mail
takes a little while, and I don't have more than one week until my
report must be finished. If the Innoculator seems safe, we will consider
buying it. If you have references from satisfied customers, please include
them too.

The department of Ellemtel at which I am working has a high security
classification, class 2 I think. Therefore a virus protection is
highly desirable. Their VAX was earlier connected to UseNet, but the risk
for infections made them "cut" the wire. They will restore the
connection whenever they feel safe, which I am supposed to make them. In
case you wonder, I am using another department's computer to mail you.

Loren, I have mentioned your idea about a conference to some people
working with me. They, and I too, are interested in such a conference.
I will inquire how interested they are. When I know, I or they will get
back to you.

I feel that the term 'virus' is being used too often when one really

I really can see the practicality of viruses hiding in between
sectors.  For one there isn't much room, maybe space for several
bytes, no more.  The virus would have to be careful not to
overwrite the following sync mark or make the next sector unreadable
by DOS.  Finally, there would have to be a sophisticated program
to read the data between sectors, concatenate the information (ie
the virus), and then execute it in memory.  Since this sopisticated
program is not a part of DOS, and since it itself could
not be hidden between sectors, the point of putting a virus
in between sectors is moot.

I've been playing around with my Options board and found that there is at
least 50K of characters that I can string together between sectors on the
40 tracks of a 360K IBM floppy.  (There is probably twice that much data room
available, but then it might interfere with the buffers of data on the
physical disk for marking where a sector begins and ends and the sector type
bytes(good, bad, etc.).  Would it not be trivial for someone to write a small
useful utility (or take an already existing one) that a lot of people might
use, and tack on the data to propogate this type of virus?  How would the
detection of this virus have to change from already existing techniques? File
size changes wouldn't be that evident because the virus would be hidden on a
non-counted part of a dsik, and the virus carrier program would still be the
same general size with just a jump to the virus code... Any ideas out there?

Subject:      Viral information file

Regarding the request for an archive of virus message information, I have
been collecting and distributing such for some time, predating the existence
of VIRUS-L.  As explanation, herewith (and I appologize for the length) a
recent submission to RISKS-FORUM.

     (Also, regarding the recent request for the first virus, I seem to recall
one person mentioning that he wrote one for the Apple in about 1979.  It's in
the file somewhere.)

     One other thing.  The file has now passed 700K.  Multiple floppies would be
a good idea.

===================

          Following my recent reposting of the directions for the "Virus
file" (and pursuant to Chip Copper's attempt to establish a "Center for
Virus Control"), I received the following message:

   Subject: Virus collection???
   From: JKILLY@BINGVMB

   Hello--I saw your posting of a set of collected virus messages in RISKS,
   and I just had to respond.  Please forgive, but are you for real?  This
   sounds like you're dispensing hellish little packages of unadulterated
   evil!  If the "collection" is so interesting, why don't you upload it
   and distribute it in a format that is not so inherently threatening?
   A person would have to be nuts to put your 5.25" diskette in any micro
   (I guess some clean shop that destroys units on a good day might find
   it acceptable).

   I'm not mad, just curious:  What *is* the point of distributing this
   stuff on diskette?  Thanks very much for your response.

                                             --Jake

         There seem to be two issues to address here.  One is the already
well addressed theme of whether or not you talk about matters relating to
security.  I generally come down on the "let-the-users-know,-and-chance-it-
on-the-hackers" side of the discussion.  In the case of viri, the users are
everywhere, and (as has been ably pointed out by others) society in general
is going to be affected by the mere *existence* of virus programs.  So, I am
compiling and distributing the material.

         Second issue: *what* am I compiling.  First off, I am not
collecting and distributing virus programs themselves (so you can give up on
the requests "Ultimate_Hacker", and sorry, Chip, I wish I *could* help.)
The file is a collection of messages from RISKS-FORUM, INFO-MAC, INFO-
IBMPC, VIRUS-L, Computers and Society Digest and various text postings on
private bulletin boards.  *All* the material is therefore readily
accessible; I am simply trying to save time for those who are trying to work
in this area.  Simply collating all the material is taking several hours per
week, and I have not yet had time to edit it all.

         The bulk of the material is from RISKS.  The topics I select for
are those announcing or analysing new viri, those suggesting virus
protection schemes (and critiques of those suggestions), opinion pieces on
the implications of viri and some messages on related security matters (such
as the recent discussion of "block mode" on terminals.)

         The total size of the file is now in excess of 700K, and is being
sent out in archived form.  (The current archive breaks out into two files,
MASTER1.VIR and MASTER2.VIR.)  I suspect that by the time you read this, the
total file will no longer fit on a single disk, even archived.  FTP is not
available from UBC, and I am not going to send out a 700K+ file out as one
or more message(s) on a daily basis.

         Future editions of this file can be obtained by sending a PC
formatted disk in a (Canadian) stamped, self addressed mailer to:

Robert M. Slade,
3118 Baird Road,
North Vancouver, B. C.
Canada        V7K 2G6

         I hope this goes some way to allaying Jake's fears.  Prudent
caution would appear to be very healthy in our current environment (although
I would think you could find *some* way of testing what you receive from
unknown sources.)

Disclaimer: ... ah, what's the point.  Nobody'd believe it anyway ...

P. S. - Herewith a local virus warning from a ways back ...

To All:

        New TROJAN has hit Portland, Oregon. Two CONSULTANTS who
use TURBO PASCAL were using a program called:

D-XREF60.COM

the program was originally from a PC-SIG library in California
but it may show up on the local BBS's.  **** BEWARE ****


This program is supposed to be a cross reference program for
Pascal programmers it does what it says PLUS it randomly deletes
file names from the DIR then it all at once scrambles the FAT.
Authors name? The infamous DORN STICKLE! Poor boy is really
getting blamed for a bunch of stuff. At any rate be careful of
this one. I repeat this is a verified TROJAN.


This messaage maybe TRANSPOSED to the PUBLIC to help the average
User defend him/her self.

Subject: novirus.arc

I suspect, after having my system quit, that NOVIRUS.ARC is in
fact a virus.
My hard disk just wouldn't boot.  I couldn't figure out
what was wrong, so I copied off only necessary files and then
reformatted in dos 3.3.  About the only good thing I can say
about the program is that it got me to upgrade to 3.3 from 3.1.
Whoopee.

The above were posted on Dial-A-File. I cannot comment on the content as I
have never used either program, but I would advise caution on the part of
those who come into contact with them. Greg?
