Subject:      MOIN EXEC

I am not sure if all of you have heared about it, so here i go!

On our net(s) a program called MOIN EXEC is loose. To the user
it looks like a super CHAT program with a answering machine, you
know that thing that says: I am not here.. . But in fact there
is some sort of power user coded in, whom it is allowed to execute
ANY CMS Command on an account running MOIN EXEC. It is already
forbidden to run MOIN EXEC, and the same program under other names,
The charge is loss of acoount, and even ``legal steps''.

Remember. If anyone offers you MOIN EXEC, or anything he discribes
as a super Chat, be extremely careful.

     Dear Computer Professional:

     I am currently in the process of developing research for a
     thesis.  The topic of this research is "Computer Security in
     the Manufacturing Environment".

     I am seeking your assistance in obtaining information
     relevant to this topic, as there currently exists no
     published data. Specifically, I would like to reach people
     in industry who have involvement in Computer Integrated
     Manufacturing (CIM), and related fields, and would be
     willing to provide me some information on their experiences
     with computer security in that environment.

     Helpful information would include policies and procedures
     (current or past), actual experiences, etc., regarding
     Computer Security (in its broadest interpretation),
     implemented specifically in the Computer Integrated
     Manufacturing (CIM), process control, and related
     environments.  Suggestions gladly considered.

     The data obtained will be compiled and published in Spring
     1989, as my master's thesis.

     I can be contacted as follows:

Subject:      TRAPDISK

I found a new TSR utility floating around to protect disks from
random INT 13h read/writes etc. Anyone hear of this program or have any
comments?

-David Bader
 DAB3@LEHIGH
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
                                TRAPDISK.COM
                                Version 1.0

                                  PURPOSE

"Trap Disk" (TRAPDISK.COM) is NOT a game!  It is a further attempt to
prevent pranksters from destroying your data.  The proliferation of the
"Trojan Horse" type programs which proport to be games but actually plant
bombs in your system which format your hard disk or erase the disk
directory, has prompted the writing of this program, as well as
CHK4BOMB.EXE ("Check for Bomb").  This program is based on BOMBSQAD.COM by
Andy Hopkins.

CHK4BOMB.EXE reads the program file from disk and attempts to spot dangerous
code and suspicious messages, but since code is often a function of run
time memory situations, it could miss spotting the "bombs".

TRAPDISK.COM is a program that intercepts calls to the BIOS code in ROM as a
suspicious program is run, displays what is going to happen during the
call, and asks if you want to continue.  You can abort or continue as you
see fit.

                   INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING TRAPDISK.COM

Type "TRAPDISK" and one or more of the following letters (upper or lower):
  "R"         to stop on a request to READ a sector
  "W"         to stop on a request to WRITE to a sector
  "V"         to stop on a request to VERIFY a sector
  "F"         to stop on a request to FORMAT a track
  "U"         to 'UNINSTALL' TRAPDISK - note that program will not be
              active, but memory can not be reused until the system
              is rebooted.
  "H" or "?"  to display a brief command summary (will not install
              TRAPDISK).

To change any of the instructions, just run the program again with the new
letters;  although TRAPDISK is a memory-resident program, once
installed it will not attempt to re-install itself.

Remember that TRAPDISK will stop only on those requests specified the last
time it was invoked.  If you start it with "F" only to stop on a FORMAT
call, and later want to add "W" to stop on a WRITE call, you must specify:
TRAPDISK FW on the DOS command line.

IF NO LETTERS ARE SPECIFIED:  TRAPDISK will remain active but will not stop
on any disk calls.  If TRAPDISK is not installed, a "blank" call will
install it in memory.

SUGGESTION: Try TRAPDISK R to stop on a READ request and then try a DIR
command.  Watch the operation on TRAPDISK when disk READS are called.  This
will give you an indication of how the program works.



                                 MESSAGES

When TRAPDISK detects a call to the BIOS routines, it checks to see if the
stop condition is met.  If the function has not been selected,  TRAPDISK
will pass control directly to the BIOS disk routine.  If, however, a stop
has been requested before a disk function occurs, TRAPDISK will display the
following message:

                   |--------------------------------------|
                   |            DISK MONITOR              |
                   |--------------------------------------|
                   |      Break on request to READ        |
                   |                                      |
                   |  DRIVE  HEAD  TRACK  SECTOR  NUMBER  |
                   |    A:     0     26     1       9     |
                   |     Data address    0BA9:00F0        |
                   |     Return address  0070:0143        |
                   |                                      |
                   |  <Esc> to Abort  <Ret> to Perform    |
                   | <Del> to perform & disable trapdisk  |
                   |--------------------------------------|

DRIVE          is the requested drive (A-D).
HEAD           is the side or head (0-1) for diskette (0-3 or more) for
               hard disk.
TRACK          is the cylinder or track in decimal (0-39 or more).
SECTOR         is the starting sector number in decimal (1-8 or 1-9 or
               more).
NUMBER         is the number of sectors involved in the operation.
DATA ADDRESS   (in HEX) is where the data is stored or read from.
RETURN ADDRESS (in Hex) is the return address for the calling program (i.e.
               the address where execution will resume after Int 13
               completes).

PRESSING THE ESCAPE KEY causes TRAPDISK to return to the calling program
with the error code for time out.  The disk operation is NOT performed.
The action the program may take on this error will vary, but the requested
disk function will NOT take place.

PRESSING THE RETURN KEY causes the program to carry on as if TRAPDISK did
not exist for this call.  Be warned that if you request a stop on a READ
operation, you will press the Return key many times just to read one file
as DOS searches directories and the FAT!  Instructive, but not too useful.

PRESSING THE DEL KEY causes the program to carry on (just like RETURN), but
there is a difference.  DEL will shut down any further checking.  The only
way to enable checking again is to call TRAPDISK with command-line
arguments (as described above).  This key is very useful in cases where you
have forgotten that TRAPDISK is installed and want to disable it so you can
get on with your work!


                 CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS versus BOMBSQAD.EXE

"TRAPDISK" has added a command-line help that functions without installing
the resident code.  It corrects a bug in "BOMBSQAD" that incorrectly
reported hard disk drive letters.  It extends the BIOS calls beyond the
diskette interrupt calls to some of the hard disk specific calls (Read
Long, Write Long, Format Bad Sector, Format Whole Disk) that "BOMBSQAD"
does not handle.  And it has added the "RETURN ADDRESS" information and the
"Del" key to the pop-up window.


                              TECHNICAL NOTES

This program can only trap access requests that go through Int 13h.
All of the DOS disk calls for standard disk/diskette devices are routed
through this interrupt.  However, access to installed devices (like some RAM
disks or OEM add-on packages like TALLGRASS & SYSGEN) is often through
vendor-sipplied device drivers.  These drivers are known to DOS and are
used in lieu of Int 13h to access these devices.  TRAPDISK CAN ONLY CAPTURE
ACCESS REQUESTS FOR DEVICES THAT ARE CONTROLLED VIA INT 13h!!!  Ergo, any
"devices" that use installed device drivers could be compromised by a well-
placed trojan horse program, even if TRAPDISK is active.

The moral: DO NOT depend on TRAPDISK to protect your add-on hard disks from
damage from a trojan horse algorhythm!


                        COPYRIGHT AND DISTRIBUTION

In the spirit of Mr. Hopkins original program, feel free to copy and
distribute this program.  We make no claim on any sort of copyright, since
this program is based on BOMBSQAD!

There are a few big problems with just trapping INT 13h.  First, it's
rather easy to circumvent.  Also, almost all programs (if not all!)
that read/write to, for example, data files use INT 13h either
directly or indirectly via DOS INT 21h calls.  Trapping out every
sector read or write can get downright annoying to the user.  To
illustrate this, try setting TRAPDISK to stop all disk writes, and
then use your favorite editor to edit *and save* a large text file.
You will slowly watch TRAPDISK count all the sectors that that one
file uses.  You will also learn to not trust, or just ignore, TRAPDISK
every time it pops up on your screen.

I don't think this program is meant to PROTECT you from Trojans and
viruses; I think it's intended for checking out NEW programs you've
just got hold of.  Using it all the time would be silly.  It merely
allows you to find out what sort of disk accesses a suspicious prog-
ram calls for, so you can test it a bit before you let it loose.

That's a good point, if you make a couple of assumptions.  Looking at
a scenario in which some program X is being tested, if X is indeed a
(fill in your favorite malicious program type), and if X either
bypasses INT 13h, or perhaps sees that INT 13h is currently owned by a
program other than the operating system and thus doesn't do its dirty
work until sometime later, then the TRAPDISK program would be useless
and would only give a false sense of safety.  Also, lets say that X is
a game and it uses disk files for keeping track of old scores, for
overlay space, for temporary scratch space, or whatever the reason;
then the TRAPDISK program would give lots of disk read/write warnings
even though X may not be in the least bit malicious.

In short, TRAPDISK may well be an effective program for doing quick
(and dirty) tests on new programs, but the user really should take its
messages (or lack thereof) with a grain of salt, and by no means
consider it conclusive.

Subject:      Conference Outline/Agenda

Because I cannot get mail through to all conference attendies, I
will put it up here.   There is no need to read this if you don't
wish to.


Outline of Conference
---------------------

I  believe everyone has  already  made flight arrangements,  if anyone
needs help, please  contact me  (215)  865-3904.  I  have  sent out  a
number  of  packets to people  attending, some  haven't  gone out yet,
because I'm not sure those people are coming.

For those of you who don't have hotels  yet, directly across  from the
ABE    airport   is  the Sheraton     Jetport  Lehigh  Valley  (Phone:
215-266-1000).  The  conference will not  be too far from the airport,
so this should  be a  good place to  stay.  The prices  here are a bit
higher than  some of   the other hotels  for  those  of  you  on tight
budgets.  Nearby the airport is an Econolodge  (Believe it or not, its
not  a bad hotel!  Phone:  215-867-8681),  as well as  a Macintosh Inn
(Good for those  of you  who like Apple  Equipment,  I cannot find the
phone number for this,  I'm  still  looking), and the  Red Roof Inn (I
have heard a number of complaints about this hotel, so you may want to
avoid  it.   It  looks  nice from  the  outside,   but rumors pervade.
215-264-5404).

Friday, Oct 21:

     Approxamately half of those coming to the conference will
     be there on Friday.   Introductions will be in order, we
     will hand out copies of the book (although copies will be
     available to those coming Saturday).   We will be holding
     this introduction at one of my offices.  This will be
     held at 701 Main Street in Hellertown (a suburb of Bethlehem).

     Those of you who have gotten directions in the mail have
     gotten a small map of the area, so it will be easier for
     you to find things, but for those of you who might not
     get mail in time:

     Directions from Sheraton Jetport, follow Airport Rd South
     to Rt 22 East.   Take the next exit off 22 onto Rt 378 South.
     Follow Rt 378 to the Hill to Hill Bridge (a large old structure
     where the road narrows, its the ONLY large bridge on the road
     so it is recognizable.).  Bear left off the bridge onto 3rd
     Street of South Bethlehem (Its the old section of town, so
     please excuse its appearance, its undergoing revitalization).
     At any of the first four traffic lights, make a right hand turn
     and a left on the next major road, 4th st.   Follow 4th street
     for about 4 miles, the road will curve to the right twice.
     Eventually, 4th street will become Main Street, Hellertown.
     Our office is a Century 21 Keim Realtors, but its new so I
     doubt we'll have a freestanding sign by the time of the conference.
     The easiest way to recognize the building:  You will see a
     new highway being constructed OVER Main Street; this is the new
     I78 project that's getting so much national attention.  We
     are DIRECTLY across from the furthest exit, at a stoplight
     which has not been turned on yet.  We are between Gutshall
     Chevy and Potts Doggie Shop.

     6:00 PM - 7:00 PM - Introductions with Coffee and Snacks,
     handing out of book.

     7:00 PM - 8:30 PM - What Are Viruses?   What are viruses,
     what forms do they take, including boot sector viruses, .EXE
     viruses, Unix and VMS viruses, and a look at some of the
     new MacIntosh woes.  Reviewing and outlining the ways the
     Lehigh, Brain, Christmas and Israeli viruses worked.  Also
     comparing the Brain and Yale Viruses.

     8:30 PM - 9:00 PM - Questions

     9:00 PM - Morning - Discussion, adjourning to a local bar or
     restraunt to talk.

Saturday, Oct 22:

     Much easier directions, we'll be holding it at WALPS Restaurant
     at the corner of Airport Road and Union Blvd for ease.  Simply
     follow Airport Rd South for about 2 1/2 miles to Union Blvd,
     Walps will be on your left.

     10:00 AM - 11:00 AM - Coffee will be served, "Tracking Computer
     Viruses" will be the topic covering how some groups track computer
     viruses, and some examples.

     11:00 AM - 12:00 Noon - A look at "Computer Tape Worms", their
     uses, how they can cause damage, and why they might be the
     virus of the future.  The damage they can cause.  How we'll have
     to stop damaging ones.

     12:00 PM - 1:00 PM - Break for lunch.  People are welcome to
     stay and eat lunch at Walps, but Union Blvd is a fast food lovers
     paradise, it also contains a major AT&T research facility.
     People can discuss what's been said so far.

     1:00 PM - 2:00 PM - Computer Security Concerns I.  Are schools in
     real danger of losing research?  How can we protect our businesses
     and colleges from the dangers?

     2:00 PM - 3:00 PM - Computer Security Concerns II.   System Integrety
     in large networked environments and mainframes.   Government security
     designs, banking systems and virus defense designs.   Included
     will be Limited Transitivity models, Limited Functionality concerns,
     Bell-LaPadula Model, the Biba Model, Complexity Based Functionality,
     and the Separation Model.  Future concerns will be discussed.

     We're going to break up early, although people are welcome to discuss
     Computers and Security, I feel this lecture will provoke a lot of
     conversation.   You have time to wander and find dinner.


6:00 PM - 9:00 PM - Back in the Hellertown office, we will be holding
     demonstrations.   We will be demonstrating various viruses, including
     a Unix virus, various anti-viral programs and hopefully a Worm program.
     Again Coffee and snacks (baked cookies, brownies and so on) will
     be provided.  We will also at this time be having a panel discussion.
     Questions will be fielded by a panel of anti-virus program writers.


Sunday, Oct. 23:

     10:30 AM - 12:00 Noon - "Future Virus Concerns", closing up the
     lecture on Computer Security, and open forum on ideas and questions.

     12:00 Noon - 1:00 PM - Lunch

     1:00 PM - 4:30 PM - Some controlled discussion, some open forum.
     We'll be discussing possible protection schemes, reviewing some of
     the ideas we've gone over, hopefully working on a new conference
     some time next year in another part of the country, discussing the
     possible dangers to the ATM networks and the dangers to tele-
     communications.

I think the main emphasis of this conference will be a pulling of ideas
and hopefully getting some people to meet and discuss problems face to
face rather than over a computer.

Comments:

University of Texas, I've had problems getting through to you, please
write me at LKK0@LEHIGH or call me at 215-865-3904.

We'll have a price for the book some time in the next few days.

People who haven't so far, please write me and tell me what day you
are coming in.

Dennis Director, please call me.

Also, a number of people mentioned that they would  like directions to
Philadelphia to see the sights and so on.  I'll be making full maps of
the Lehigh Valley Area, Pennsylvania and Philly  available to you when
you get here.   If you are coming  early,  I  will  mail them  to you,
please let me know.  If anyone wants to  spend an hour  and a  half to
trek to New York City, I will try to get you some maps.

Any questions???   Loren Keim

Subject:      Earnest request

  On behalf of some people that I know and many others, I am sure, that I
do not know, I am voicing this earnest request:

  We are a group that has signed on to this Newsletter out of genuine
concern about the issue at hand, and with real hope of learning about what
could be done to stymie the very serious problem of computer viruses.  But
alas we find ourselves flooded by a torrent of material which is
unnecessarily verbose, much of it simply not related at all to the subject
at hand, often plain smart-alecky, and many times just plain irrelevant.
Examples abound.  I am including here just a short one, which I selected
more or less at random:
