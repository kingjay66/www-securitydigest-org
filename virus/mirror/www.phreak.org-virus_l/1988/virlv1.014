Subject:      Will The Source of The Worm be Published ?

        Greetings ,
Has anyone out there heard if the ArpaNet Worm source will be published ?
I've heard that NSA is trying hard to prevent this ...
Does anyone know something about ?

     Thanx ,
            Kostas

[Ed. I know that at least a couple people are doing formal papers on
the subject, and that there is some talk of an RFC (request for
comment from the Internet governing body) being produced.  The latter
is uncertain.  Anyone else have any more info?]

Subject: CSI Standpoint on Internet worm (long)

I have just returned from the 15th annual Computer Security Institute
Conference (held this year in Miami Beach).  This conference was
attended by over 1500 computer security professionals.
The CSI Advisory Council composed the following and distributed
to all attendees.  The intent is to send 'an important message
to the computer criminal and to our public servants':

  To: CSI Conferees
  From: The CSI Advisory Council

   The education and motivation that all of us receive during this
   and other computer security conferences helps us to be more
   effective practitioners.  This year's CSI Conference especially
   should call us to action.  You probably attended at least one
   workshop that discussed the recent ARPANET situation.

   Whether or no the media "decides" that any damage was done, it
   clearly produced lost time, slipped deadlines, or--at the very
   least-- a few cycles of management "think time" worrying about
   computer viruses.

   We encourage you to do two things immediately upon your return:

       1. Send a letter to your local U.S. attorneys recommending
    that the ARPANET virus situation be prosecuted to the full extent
    of the law.  It may even be appropriate that your organization
    take some form of independent legal action in this case; and,

       2. Send a letter to your state and federal legislators
    requesting that they aggressively pursue the development of
    effective computer crime legislation.  You might even offer to
    help evaluate drafts of pending bills.  Attached are sample of
    letters you may wish to use as models to get this message to your
    local U.S. attorneys and your legislators.

   Consider spending a few minutes "wordsmithing" one or more letters
   and then send them to the people who can make and enforce computer
   crime laws.  As an emerging profession, we can send an important
   message to the computer criminal and to our public servants...
   a message that we take our responsibilities seriously, and that
   we want to establish solid legal accountability for computer
   and information protection.

 SAMPLE LETTER TO A UNITED STATES ATTORNEY:

  Hon.___________________
  United States Attorney

  Sir:
  I am in charge of computer security for this organization.  In the
  wake of the recent attack of the ARPANET virus, it was necessary
  to close down our usual computer operations and devote _______
  hours of debugging and testing before we could safely resume
  normal operation.

  This represents a significant interruption of our business, and
  deprived us of an estimated $_______ of employee time.

  In discussing this matter with other computer security
  professionals, I find that our organization was only one of many
  which were disrupted or damaged by the deliberate introduction of
  a viral program.  It is my understanding that abuse of access is
  punishable under Title 18 United States Code 1030(a)(3).  The
  vehicle for this contamination of our systems, as you know, was
  the ARPANET computer network.  If, for example, a primary waterway
  was polluted, I am confident that your office would act and act
  firmly; a primary data stream should be equally protected.

  I urge you to take a close look at this particular offense, and
  to prosecute it vigorously.  I am ready to provide evidence of its
  impact on our organization, and I will be glad to assist you in
  documenting further victimization.

                (Signed)_______________________

 SAMPLE LETTER TO A UNITED STATES ATTORNEY:

 Dear U.S. Attorney:

 I am writing to you to express my organization's concern over the
 apparent apathy within the Justice Department as evidenced by
 their failure to vigorously pursue computer crime incidents and
 to assume a leadership role in this arena.  The recent ARPANET
 virus case, which has affected thousands of computer systems and
 cost companies and institutions tens of thousands of man-hours to
 investigate and remedy--not to mention the cost of denying use of
 those systems--appears to be another example of this apathy.

 I, along with many other responsible computer professionals
 across the United States, beleive it is imperative that this most
 recent incident be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
 It is not in the best interests of businesses and other
 organizations to allow the person(s) responsible for this
 situation to avoid being held accountable for their actions, let
 alone be allowed to profit by it.  To do so would only encourage
 more of the same.

 Existing federal computer crime statutes, such as 18 USC
 1030(a)(3), can be applied in this case.  My organization expects
 those avenues to be fully pursued by the Justice Department.
 I would appreciate knowing what actions will be taken by your
 department in this matter.

            Sincerely,

 SAMPLE LETTER TO A STATE OR FEDERAL LEGISLATOR:

 Dear Senator/Representative _______________:

 I am a computer professional whose job responsibilities include
 protecting the integrity and reliability of my company's critical
 business data.  If organizations are to gro and prosper, business
 decisions must be made on the basis of accurate and timely data.

 I am personally and professionally appalled by the risks posed to
 this decision-making ability by computer criminals. I therefore
 join my tens of thousands of responsible colleagues and millions
 of citizens who support the development ond enforcement of strict
 computer crime legislation.  I urge you to aggressively push for
 full penalties for perptrators of computer crimes, especially
 the creation of damaging virus programs, as was the case in the
 recent ARPANET incident.

 As your constituents, we encourage and expect your support for
 the necessary computer crime legislation.  I am willing to work
 with you in evaluating and developing laws that protect our
 valuable decision-making ability.  I look forward to hearing
 from you.

                   Very truly yours,

Subject:      CMS Protected Mode (IBM VM/CMS)


On the REXX Discussion list, the subject on the CHRISTMA EXEC also
appeared, and someone had a comment that in CMS, you can run a program
in 'protected mode'. Can anybody give me more details?

Subject:  UK televison programme.
From:     Julian Daley <jdaley@UXG.UMDS.LON.AC.UK>

This message may well get to UK sites too late to matter, but here
goes ...

Channel 4 in the UK (? S4C) are screening the penultimate programme in
their Equinox series on Sunday 20 November.  The programme
concentrates on chaos and promises to cover the history behind the
subject and current thinking.  I haven't seen any of the other
programmes in this series so I can't vouch for its accuracy or
eloquence.

I'll try to watch the programme (video recorder permitting !) and if
there is anything interesting post a reply to The List.  (Don't let
that stop anyone else who sees it from commenting - I'm a physicist,
not a TV critic ! )

Julian.

Subject: Report of brain virus sighting (PC)


For those of you who are interested in such things, there are
indications that the "brain" virus might have hit Pitt. By
'indications' I mean that someone in the labs said he discovered it
using 'nobrain', a pd (?)  virus detector/eliminator.
