Subject:      Monthly info from Ken



[ Last modified 29-July-88 - Ken van Wyk ]

Welcome!  This is the monthly introduction posting for VIRUS-L,
primarily for the benefit of any newcomers.  Apologies to all
subscribers who've already read this in the past (you'll only have to
see it once a month and you can, if you're quick, press the purge
key...:-).


What is VIRUS-L?

It is an electronic mail discussion forum for sharing information
about computer viruses.  Discussions should include (but not
necessarily be limited to): current events (virus sightings), virus
prevention (practical and theoretical), and virus questions/answers.
The list is non-moderated and non-digested.  That means that any
message coming in goes out immediately.  Weekly logs of submissions
are kept for those people who prefer digest format lists (see below
for details on how to get them).


What isn't VIRUS-L?

A place to spread hype about computer viruses; we already have the
Press for that.  :-)  A place to sell things, to panhandle, or to
flame other subscribers.  If anyone *REALLY* feels the need to flame
someone else for something that they may have said, then the flame
should be sent directly to that person and/or to the list moderator
(that'd be me, <LUKEN@LEHIIBM1.BITNET>).


How do I get on the mailing list?

Well, if you're reading this, chances are *real good* that you're
already on the list.  However, perhaps this document was given to you
by a friend or colleague...  So, to get onto the VIRUS-L mailing list,
send a mail message to <LISTSERV@LEHIIBM1.BITNET>.  In the body of the
message, say nothing more than SUB VIRUS-L your name.  LISTSERV is a
program which automates mailing lists such as VIRUS-L.  As long as
you're either on BITNET, or any network accessible to BITNET via
gateway, this should work.  Within a short time, you will be placed on
the mailing list, and you will get confirmation via e-mail.


How do I get OFF of the list?

If, in the unlikely event, you should happen to want to be removed from
the VIRUS-L discussion list, just send mail to
<LISTSERV@LEHIIBM1.BITNET> saying SIGNOFF VIRUS-L.  People, such as
students, whose accounts are going to be closed (like over the
summer...) - PLEASE signoff of the list before you leave.  Also, be
sure to send your signoff request to the LISTSERV and not to the list
itself.  Note that the appropriate node name is LEHIIBM1, not LEHIGH;
we have a node called LEHIGH, but they are *NOT* one and the same.


How do I send a message to the list?

Just send electronic mail to <VIRUS-L@LEHIIBM1.BITNET> and it will
automatically be redistributed to everyone on the mailing list.  By
default, you will NOT receive a copy of your own letters.  If you wish
to, send mail to <LISTSERV@LEHIIBM1.BITNET> saying SET VIRUS-L REPRO


I can't submit anything to the list - what's wrong?

There have been a few cases where people found that they were unable
to send anything in to VIRUS-L even though they were registered
subscribers (only subscribers can participate).  Let me try to explain.
The LISTSERV program differentiates lowercase from UPPERCASE.  So,
if you've subscribed to the list as (for example) OPUS@BLOOM.COUNTY.EDU
and your mail is actually coming through as Opus@Bloom.County.EDU, then
the LISTSERV will think that you're not subscribed to the list.
BITNET usernames and node names are automatically uppercased by
the LISTSERV, but other network addresses are not.  If your site
(or you) should happen to make a change to, say, the system mailer
such that it changes the case of your mail, there will be problems.
If you're having problems submitting (you'll know this because
the LISTSERV will say "Not authorized to send to VIRUS-L..."), try
unsubscribing and re-subscribing.  If that doesn't work, send me
mail (LUKEN@LEHIIBM1.BITNET), and I'll try to fix things up.


What does VIRUS-L have to offer?

All submissions to VIRUS-L are stored in weekly log files which can be
downloaded by any user on (or off) the mailing list; readers who prefer
digest format lists should read only the weekly logs.  There is also a
small archive of some of the public anti-virus programs which are
currently available.  This archive, too, can be accessed by any user.
All of this is handled automatically by the LISTSERV here at Lehigh
University (<LISTSERV@LEHIIBM1.BITNET>).


How do I get files from the LISTSERV?

Well, you'll first want to know what files are available on the
LISTSERV.  To do this, send mail to <LISTSERV@LEHIIBM1.BITNET> saying
INDEX VIRUS-L.  Note that filenames/extensions are separated by a
space, and not by a period.  Once you've decided which file(s) you
want, send mail to <LISTSERV@LEHIIBM1.BITNET> saying GET filename
filetype.  For example, GET VIRUS-L LOG8804 would get the file called
VIRUS-L LOG8804 (which happens to be the monthly log of all messages
sent to VIRUS-L during April, 1988).  Note that, starting June 6, 1988,
the logs are weekly.  The new file format is VIRUS-L LOGyymmx where
yy is the year (88, 89, etc.), mm is the month, and x is the week
(A, B, etc.).  Readers who prefer digest format lists should read
the weekly logs and sign off of the list itself.  Subsequent submissions
to the list should be sent to me for forwarding.

Also available is a LISTSERV at SCFVM which contains more anti-virus
software.  This LISTSERV can be accessed in the same manner as outlined
above, with the exceptions that the address is <LISTSERV@SCFVM.BITNET>
and that the commands to use are INDEX PUBLIC and GET filename filetype
PUBLIC.


What is uuencode/uudecode, and why do I need them?

Uuencode and uudecode are two programs which convert binary files into
text (ASCII) files and back again.  This is so binary files can be
easily transferred via electronic mail.  Many of the files on this
LISTSERV are binary files which are stored in uuencoded format (the
file types will be UUE).  Both uuencode and uudecode are available from
the LISTSERV.  Uudecode is available in BASIC and in Turbo Pascal here.
Uuencode is available in Turbo Pascal.  Also, there is a very good
binary-only uuencode/uudecode package on the LISTSERV which is stored
in uuencoded format.


Why have posting guidelines?

To keep the discussions on-track with what the list is intended to be;
a vehicle for virus discussions.  This will keep the network traffic
to a minimum and, hopefully, the quality of the content of the mail to
a maximum.  No one wants to read personal flames ad nausium, or
discussions about the pros and cons of digest-format mailing lists,
etc.



What are the guidelines?

     As already stated, there will be no flames on the list.  Anyone
     sending flames to the entire list must do so knowing that he/she
     will be removed from the list immediately.

     Same goes for any commercial plugs or panhandling.

     Submissions should be directly or indirectly related to the
     subject of computer viruses.

     Responses to queries should be sent to the author of the query,
     not to the entire list.  The author should then send a summary
     of his/her responses to the list at a later date.

     "Automatic answering machine" programs (the ones which reply
     to e-mail for you when you're gone) should be set to *NOT*
     reply to VIRUS-L.  Such responses sent to the entire list
     are very rude and will be treated as such.

     When sending in a submission, try to see whether or not someone
     else may have just said the same thing.  This is particularly
     important when responding to someone else's posting (which should
     be sent to that person *anyway*).  It's very easy to get multiple
     messages saying the exact same thing.  No one wants this to
     happen.

Thank-you for your time and for your adherance to these guidelines.
Comments and suggestions, as always, are invited.  Please address them
to me, <LUKEN@LEHIIBM1.BITNET> or <luken@Spot.CC.Lehigh.EDU>.

Subject:      MS-DOS: new strain of virus?

Hello experts,

last night one of our staff members detected evidence of a virus that has
infected every puplicly accessible AT or compatible at our department
(computing center of an university), and more than 50% of the ATs used by
staff persons only.  Meanwhile, I think I know how this virus spreads.
So far, it has not done any harm, but I do not know what it will do to
the befallen in future.

Please find details below.  Has anybody seen this particular strain of
virus before?  If so, what do we have to expect, if we do not succeed
in destroying all copies?  Please answer privatly to me to avoid unneces-
sary network traffic; I'll summarize to The List.

If this is a new strain, somebody (me?) will probably have to dis-
assemble it to find out, what threat it contains.  This will probably
last for a couple of weeks,  so do not expect quick results.  For this
task, I'll probably need a dis-assembler and a compare-program.  Who can
me tell, where to obtain such tools?

Thanks for your time, and best regards
                                        Otto

--------------

Symptoms:

1. Apparently, the virus makes itself core-resident and waits for some
   .COM or .EXE file to be started.

2. When a .COM or .EXE is started, the virus inserts itself into that
   very program, making it exactly 1704 Bytes longer, according to the
   DIR command.  If the program resides on a write-protected disk, the
   virus will cause a write-protect error, instead.

   No program is infected twice.

   I tried it with a pseudo program of 4 bytes (my 1st name), and found
   that after the infection these 4 bytes had apparently been over-
   written (visual inspection with TYPE only -- we'll use some suitable
   editor after des-infection).  A .COM and an .EXE file with the same
   file name and the same 4 bytes content yielded apparently identical
   infected files (visual inspection with TYPE only -- no comparison pro-
   gram run, so far), while another test case with a different file name
   and different contents (5 Bytes) showed a slight difference in the
   infected file.  Astonishingly, even these pseudo programs are termi-
   nated without any error message from DOS.

3. When you run the infected program on another computer, it will
   continue to infect every .COM or .EXE file started there.

Recovery:

We've begun to re-install software on the infected disks, proceeding
thus (thanks to VIRUS-L for many hints during the last couple of months):

1. On dedicated computers, backup the important data files.  Be sure not
   to backup any .COM or .EXE file.  Skip this step on public computers.
   (BTW, an incredibly stupid notion, a "contradictio in adjecto": these
   "public Personal Computers", we were forced to install on account of
   decisions by our government!  Now, we're experiencing the consequences
   of this oddity.)

2. Switch off the Computer.

3. Switch it on again, booting from a write-protected, original system
   disk.  Install the software again from write-protected originally
   vendor-supplied disks.

   On one computer, test for presence of the virus after installation of
   every software component, to make sure the virus doesn't come from a
   software package (vendors aren't immune, are they?? :-)

   On the publicly accessible computers, this step involves removing the
   SafeGuard Cards, installed therein.  We can't distribute the repaired
   software through the PC-Network, as this would require at least one
   .COM or .EXE file on the receiving side.  All we can do to save some
   labour, is installing the DOS and networking component on every com-
   puter, install the other components only on the server and re-distri-
   bute them from it.  (Again, you see the advantage of a host, where
   software is maintained only in 1 copy, over a pool of PCs!)

4. On dedicated computers, restore the backed-up files.

Apparently, we are facing pretty much labour to re-install everything
properly.

5. Try to develop some virus-recognizing program to avoid future
   infection from the same strain.  Still unsolved problem: how can we
   force every user to apply this program to her disks, before starting
   any .COM or .EXE???  Suggestions welcome!

Subject:      A Modest Proposal


    With the mess that the nets are in right now, an idea that Info-Micro
went to on the Arpa side is due. Info-Micro distributes unmoderated Digests at
a once per day rate. The Digests may be sent twice on occasion, but as they
are numbered and dated, it is easy to eliminate substitutes and trail down
evil mailers in the net (not as much of a problem on ARPA/MILNET since the
topology is point to point. *FAILED* mail is the big problem, as the mailer
retries for three days and sends a copy of the failed mail to EVERY MEMBER OF
THE LIST _E_A_C_H_ _D_A_Y_ !!!) Unattended operation might make many people
happier, but semi-automatic operation is probably safer, although I would
rather get digests regularly, than one behemoth when the digester has been
away for two weeks. I will post any comments/flames I get, but you can send
mail directly to Ken (see his monthly blurb for his address) if you like this
idea. Send all disagreements to /dev/null ;-)

That's a suggestion that I'd considered a while ago, and I put it up
to a vote.  The bottom line was that most people preferred running
VIRUS-L undigested and unmoderated.  You can, of course, unsubscribe
and read just the weekly logs if you wish.  That's a pseudo-digest
list.  That's what the majority wanted.

Let's *please* not get into a debate about the pros and cons of
digest/non-digest.  I went with the majority vote.  Enough said about
digesting, ok?

Thanks,

Ken

Subject:      SCORES spread question


Yesterday, we discovered that the MAC network in our Library was infected
with the SCORES virus. This was identified by INTERFERON V3.0. This morning
FERRET V1.1 was used to clean up the hard disks and the Library folks will
now go through their application diskettes and clean them up as well. A
major problem is that the network is publicly available (bring your own
diskettes). FERRET reported the infection dates - the earliest one
was May 23, 1988.

We seem to see some evidence that the virus has been spread through data
files. Does anyone know if this is possible? The other possibility is
that these (not extremely computer literate) users are not remembering
everything quite correctly, but we have at least one who clains to have
taken a disk containing "just the data I wanted to print" to this network
to use the laser printer, then contaminating a stand-alone MAC in another
location later with that disk. Thoughts?

Subject:      Yale Virus Info

I have noe dissabled the Yale virus entirely.  Here are some specifics...

There is a format table set up to format the 40th track for 8 sectors
/track.  The final bios is call is missing however so the format is
never done.

The virus copies itself  to high memory and reduces the MS-DOS memory
count by 1K.

It then reads the original boot sector which was kept on track 40,
sector 8, which is then executed.

This virus takes over two vectors: int 9 and Int 19.  Int 19 is the
reboot vector.  Int 9 is the keyboard vector.

The Virus only spreads on reboot.  If an infected disk was booted and
you do a warm boot (Ctrl-Alt-Del) it will infect the new disk.  The
keyboard handler has the logic to watch for this reboot.

The keyboard handler also has a hook for Ctrl-Alt-i.  If pressed the
virus copies it generation count to 40:72.  If I remember correctly,
(I cant figure out where I saw this originally) this location is
checked on reboot for 1234H.  If found it does a quick boot.  It is
possible that the writer wanted to make this a key for dont infect,
but on all machines I have access to, this isnt the case.

The virus resets the screen by putting a byte in memory.  This method
doesnt work correctly on new machines.  Instead of clearing the
screen, it converts it to 40 column mode.  (This is how it was
noticed)

This virus keeps a generation count.  It doesnt appear to use this
count for anything (except as mentioned above).  The version I got had
a generation number 14h.

The virus will jump to ROM basic if ti cannot load the original boot
sector.

I beleive this is either and old virus or written by someone with an
old machine.  The format is 8 tracks instead of the current 9.  The
jump for ROM basic is in.  The screen clear is done with a poke (this
does clear the screen on an original PC but not on newer machines.)
etc...

The virus infects almost any diskette, but it must be in drive A:
(eliminating hard drives).  It will only boot PC(XT) compatibles.  I
could not get it to boot an AT (I tried Zenith 248 and 286).  It will
also infect almost any version of DOS.  I have tried DOS 1.0 thru 3.3.

The virus has no harmful effects except for writing onto track 40.
Even on high density drives where this is in the middle of the disk.
If track 40 is written to after it is infected, it will cause the disk
to become unbootable.

If anyone has seen this virus, or has any questions, please drop me a
line.

Chris.

Uh, I'd REALLY want to check over those files again if I were you;
Ferret 1.1 doesn't always clean up Scores completely...! Try KillScores
instead (available from our LISTSERV).

>We seem to see some evidence that the virus has been spread through data

No. Scores ONLY affects files which contain executable (CODE) resources;
details notwithstanding, unless you have VERY peculiar data files (with
CODE in them? Wow), you can't catch Scores from a data file.

Just as a thought -- Lightspeed C project files have code added to them;
this couldn't be the case here, could it? Also, get Vaccine on ALL of
your public machines, and teach the users that the Vaccine dialog means
biiiiiiiiig trouble. "Wanted" posters, e.g., "Has you seen this dialog?",
are a good way to do this. Vaccine is also available from LISTSERV@SCFVM;
please e-mail me directly if you'd like some help.

I certainly prefer them to hydrogen bombs.

During the second world war, the US authorities used a different
currency in Hawaii than they did on the continent.  This was a defense
against counterfeit currency attacks.  Note that counterfeiting is
difficult except with the resources of a sovereign power.  There are
both a cheesy film and a cheesy tv series based upon the premise that
Nazi Germany had attempted to de-stabilize Great Britain by debasing its
currency with counterfeit.  (Both of these include a line about the
conscription of felons to help carry out the attack.)  To the best of my
knowledge there was never such an attack, even against the notoriously
easy to counterfeit US currency.

While such attacks make great fantasy, they do not make very good
warfare.  Both the US and Great Britain were very busy debasing their
own currency.  They did not need any help from the Axis powers.  While
colorful, these attacks are not nearly so damaging as bombs or
artillery, even though they may be cheaper.

the use of criminals also suggests that, even in wartime, there are
limits beyond which noble people do not go.  Counterfeiting and forgery
are the tactics of criminals.  Even spying has a taint to it.  Saboteurs
are dealt with much more severely than soldiers.

Viruses are the tools of the immature, the sneaks, and the cowards; not
those of the hero.

I have three replies to this:
  (1) Just where do you expect to get the checksum, relative to the generating
polynomial which I use for detection of viral infection, of even ONE file of
mine?  I'm certainly not going to publish one.  Are you going to get onto my
computer and peek at the files on my hard disk, hoping to find my checksum base
and hoping that the data isn't stored in encrypted form?  (If you should by some
chance succeed, you'll find my polynomial there too, without your even having to
compute it!)  Well, if my files were sufficiently important (or if I were suf-
ficiently paranoid) to think that someone would be willing to devote a year of
computer time for them, I would certainly keep my checksum base (and checksum
program) offline, on a diskette which I would keep locked up and which I would
insert into my computer only during the time I check my CRCs.
  (2) Assuming you have somehow managed to get ahold of one of my checksums,
by the time you come up with my polynomial after a full year (!!), I will have
changed my generator several times, and you will have spent an awful lot of
computer time for nothing!   Okay, for sake of argument let's suppose you pull
our your checkbook and purchase a real fast computer with parallel processors,
like the Cray 3 (*) if you can hold out another year until it's available.  Then
you could do it much faster, before I get a chance to change my generator.  But
again, if my files are sufficiently important, I will checksum each of them not
once, but twice or more, each time using a different generator.  So you got
*one* of my polynomials; so what?
  (3) Let's suppose for sake of argument that (a) I'm important enough for you
to devote all this computation time or power, (b) I use only one generator,
(c) I hand you one of my checksums, and (d) I haven't had time to change my
generator by the time you've computed it.  When all is said and done, you've got
a weapon only against *MY* files.  Now if you're interested in attacking other
people who use a personal/random CRC, you're going to have to go through all
that again for each and every one of them.  If, on the other hand, you're inte-
rested in attacking only me, you hardly need a virus; a simple immediate-acting
Trojan will do.  And in that case, *no* checksum program will help, no matter
how sophisticated or secure!  So tell me: Why bother calculating my polynomial
at all??

In what *practical* sense have DES and RSA been shown to be appreciably more
secure than a Rabin-type CRC?  What I know is that RSA can be broken if someone
should find a reasonably quick way of factoring very large numbers.  I don't
seem to recall that the proposers of RSA have shown that to be impossible.
  As for DES (here I am relying mainly on an article by Tom Athanasiou in the
Risks Digest): (1) It was created essentially by modifying IBM's LUCIFER.  How-
ever the modifications seem to have been all in the direction of *weakening* it.
And the reason was evidently so that the code-breaking department of the NSA
would be able to *break* it when used by others.  Thus the key size was reduced
from 128 to 56 bits.  (2) Changes were also made in the S-boxes.  It has been
rumored that the NSA inserted a "trapdoor" into them in order to make the system
vulnerable; in any case, mathematicians have demonstrated the possibility of
weakening the cipher by introducing hidden regularities into the S-boxes.
(3) In 1985, the NSA abandoned DES.  At that time its deputy director for commu-
nications security was quoted as saying that he "wouldn't bet a plugged nickel
on the Soviet Union not breaking [DES]".  So whatever theoretical criteria DES
may satisfy, its proposers have not only not shown the system to be secure in
practice, but they have even abandoned it on grounds of its being *in*secure.

  Of course, you might reply, there's no *absolute* guarantee of security with
*any* system.  Well, it seems to me that the difference between our views lies
in where to draw the line between the insufficiently secure and the (apparently)
sufficiently secure.  The brute force scheme which you describe may be worth-
while if you're trying to *break a cipher* of some important intelligence or
military agency.  (The fact that you refer me to Kahn's book strongly suggests
that that's the application you have in mind.)  But we here on the list are
concerned only with virusbusting.  Of course, cryptographic techniques are
welcome for that purpose.  But one has to keep a proper sense of proportion.
It's straining the imagination to suppose that the ordinary type of virus
creator would spend over a year of computer time to break a CRC checker used for
viral detection purposes by ordinary individuals or institutions, and *that* is
the community *I* am concerned with.  These people need a *fast* algorithm with
*reasonably* high degree of security, and (present-day) cryptosystems simply
can't meet the first of these two requirements.
  Your standards concerning security are presumably much higher than mine, while
the increased execution time demanded by cryptosystems doesn't seem to play the
slightest part in your considerations.  Hence you apparently draw the line I
mentioned above  somewhere between a 31-bit CRC and DES.  But for the purposes I
have described, it suffices to draw it between a fixed-generator CRC and a
personal/random one.

  Besides, by emphasizing brute-force methods of breaking schemes, you miss the
*real* danger; "real" because it's *MUCH* more likely to be employed by a virus
creator than a brute-force method.  As I said in my posting of Aug. 29, that
comes from certain *loopholes* which must be blocked by the program utilizing
the checksum algorithm.  Without such blocking, *no* checksum algorithm, no
matter how sophisticated, can provide dependable detection of viral detection.
My program has them.  Does yours....??

Otto,

  The virus you describe seems to be similar, in general terms, to the Israeli
virus (which was described in VIRUS-L several months ago), although the details
seem to be slightly different.

  I'm sending you a separate file containing a program IMMUNE (in uuencoded
form).  Execute that, and if your virus is similar enough to ours (captures int
21h to control program execution), IMMUNE should prevent future infection and
warn you each time an attempt is made.

  If you want further help, send me a copy of a small COM file and a small EXE
file which are infected by your virus (actual programs, please; no psuedos).  If
all goes well, we'll be able to modify our program for removing the virused
portion of infected files so that it works on your virus too, avoiding the need
for you to perform the re-installation procedure you described.

Hi folks,

some people mentioned that the DES is insecure because it only allows
a 56 bit key. That's not correct: DES allows a 768 (!!!!) bit key!
How to use this key length? Skip the key schedule routine and fill
in your own 16 48-bit-keys K1,...,K16. Going this way, you have
16 times 48-bit = 768 bits.
I really believe that the NSA, sorry the NBS dropped DES not because
of its insecurity but because its *too* secure (you know what I mean :-)
The NSA declared to develop its own encryption standard without help
from firm outside (like IBM in the case of DES). So nobody will be
able to have a look on the algorithms. So the NSA can do what she
want.... for example to make sure that they can read everything they
want to read....

All the best,
Bernd.

I use "sterilize" and "disable"  to convey the notion of preventing
reproductive behavior while preserving other information and perhaps
even other behavior.  I use "kill" and  "destroy" both in the sense of
destroy; i.e., erase, delete, and overwrite.

it worked, and it probably saved countless lives.  I don't intend to spend my

It did save  lives, yeah? Even it did  it did so only because no  one else had
it. If the Japanese would've had it then ...
And if  "your country" - as  you want to see  it - is threatened  (by "someone
elses country",  I assume) and you  decide to release  a virus I feel  you are
threatening  my country  also  (or  can you  guarantee  that  "my country"  is
spared?) and  I will not hesitate  to take appropriate counter-action  and ...
you see where this  leads to. And maybe I should start right  now - my country
is threatened  by atom bombs since  they were invented. So  all countries with
ICBMs and nuclear warheads watch out!

In an earlier posting warning about human frailities and computer
security, it seems that the intense dramitic scenario touched off a
discussion about viruses in warfare. Fascinating exchange of comments
but I should put an important comment here...

The scenarios were extreme case. The depiction of viruses used for
"political" reasons was intended to be depicted as being sought by
groups more used to working outside of the regular conventions of
law, and other social constraints. Most likely candidates if this were
ever to happen would be terrorist groups which are already oriented to
working outside of normal bounds. Besides this orientation, another
factor enters- the difference in perspective from that of governmennts.
Many governments would be far more cautious realizing that they have
much to lose and that they have a "return address" should some crazy
"viruses war" scheme be attempted and discovered. They also know,
hopefully, the danger of things getting out of control when the modes
of C3I - communications, command, control, and intelligence - get
severely disrupted. Such disruption rather than leading to miltary or
political success could, in this age, lead to a lethal panic. So, I
doubt that as a form of "warfare" viruses would be serious considered
by most countries.

For "outsider" groups, the changes are higher. But still very low,
except for small scale harrassment. I have gotten reports on some
groups using variety of computer means to harrass opposing groups.
But these have very localized and very temporary. (And quite
illegal.) The overall picture of terrorism and computers is that if
terrorist want to disrupt a computer center, they used more crude,
physical means- arson, explosives, etc. To date, there has been no
substantiated report of computer viruses used for political /
terroristic motives. (The Hebrew University case was reported in some
articles in US papers as a politically motivated viruses. That was an
erroneous report. The allegation may have happened from the combination
of "excitment" on the part of the writers and from an easy misunder-
standing or misrendition of the Hebrew word Mechabel (can mean eith
either sabateur or a terrorist.))

So this picture of "virus wars" is mentioned as possibilty among many
others, but a low probability one. The biggest threat of viruses
still remains the "hackers" and the innocent vectors. As for the
specific targetted use of viruses, the greater likelihood would
be "insiders" seeking revenge or some other self-oriented goal.

Gentlemen, Gentlemen...

War is not an instance of rational minds at work.  Rather, it is the failure of
 rational minds.  Viruses also might be considered a failure of an otherwise
rational mind.  Regardless, in the event of a war, I think we can assume that
both sides will be doing whatever they can to disrupt whatever they can.

I think the question should be something on the order of "Will the exchange of
computer viruses be so detrimental that no one will instigate it?"  This is
approximately the situation with nuclear weapons.  As with nuclear weapons,
both sides may seek the capacity to win with a first strike, but neither is
likely to achieve that capacity given the "roughly" equal resources.

This presumes of course, that this warrants further discussion on this
list.

I'm not going to go on a long strung lecture about this, but I don't feel
that viruses should be illegal to write for several reasons.  First of all,
it would be virtually impossible to monitor this to the extent necessary
for it to be taken seriously and obeyed.  Take software piracy- illegal,
unmonitored, and rampant - nobody is afraid of being prosecuted for copying
a piece of software because it doesnt happen.  Second of, its a matter of
freedom.  Many anti-porn people think that all pornography should be taken
off the newsstands and not allowed to be sold.  That in itself would be
a crime- to take away one's freedom of choice.  Nobody is forcing a person
to buy such reading material if they don't want it.  What I write as a
programmer sould be my own business!  Many viruses are contracted by people
that download unknown software from bulletin boards.  If they didn't down-
load it, it wouldn't have propegated in their system.  Every time you download
something- you take a risk that it has a nasty virus.  If you go to a store
and buy a program, you can expect it to be "clean".  I believe that the
concept should be something like this:  It should be illegal to write or
distribute software that is intentionally made to destroy information of
any sort - unless that is the intention of the software, and quite clearly
stated so.  One purpose of a virus could be:  a small company doesnt want
any of its employees stealing its confidential database/software/etc- so
they install a time-bomb, and keep resetting it periodically, but if an
emmployee were to steal the disk, they wouldn't know how to reset it, and
it would self-destruct.  Also, any software written out of malace to
intentionally destroy information should be anywhere from a misdemeanor
to a felony depending on the scope of the damage/criminal record/etc.  I
believe that the most important area to focus on at first is the corporate/
university level.  This is where the most dammage can be caused.  Viruses
entering corporations/schools have been known to have devistating damage-
and thus should be dealt with very strictly.  Basically, what I'm saying
is that one should be able to write whatever one wants to- consider it freedom
of the press, supression is not the american way, however if one actually
uses a virus- then action should be taken.  Remember: you can talk about
shooting the president, there's nothing illegal about that, but if you actually
do so: then you are legally liable.  You have the freedom to make your own
decisions and then decide the consequences.

Re: "Good" virus

Hmmm - sounds like some genetic research controversies lately...

Actually, I would rather blow away the infected files and go to
my most recent backup then risk putting a virus in - What if the
"good" virus gets perverted?  (could be almost as fun as the
micro copy protection battles...)

Besides, why do with a virus what can be done with a normal program?
For the Apple //s, there are a number of programs that look for symptoms
of known viruses and inform you of their presence - the same task I take
it that your "good" virus would perform.  The added risk of a virus
just doesn't justify to me the risks involved.
just doesn't justify to me the risks involved when all I need to do is
run a virus detector on any executable additions to my system, and every
once in a while to catch any requiring an incubation period.

What is Hypercard? Is it a command language like REXX, or what?

Subject:      Different Operating Systems

I was just wondering what the relatvie susceptibility of each available
operating system on the market was, in terms of security from viruses
and other nasties. We can tell that IBM and PC/MS-DOS are fairly
leaky just from reading this discussion. What about the operating
systems of Ataris, Amigas, Macintoshes? Do they all share the same
kind of open environment that DOS possesses? Is anyone more/less
susceptible to viruses? Are any of them harder/easier to write
viruses for? Are any of them harder/easier to protect? I suspect
the answer is that they are all equally vulnerable, but curiosity
demands that I ask.

From previous items, I know that mainframes and such
are the hardest to infect, so I won't ask about them here.

+ If you get infected by an origional piece of software strait from the
+ Manufacturer, can you sue the software company .... ?
-
Yes.   You'd probably even win.   You MIGHT even get compensation
beyond the cost of the sofware and clean-up, but I doubt it.
-
You can sue anybody for anything.   Winning the suit is
sometimes based on precedent, sometimes on who spends the
most money, and frequently on random chance...

Subject:      'Good' Viruses

... Why [not] write a "good" virus which can hunt them
[bad viruses] down and remove them?
-
1:  Its hard enough to predict what a program is
    going to do on YOUR system.  What it does on
    someone elses, and the systemic behavior as it
    propagates is REALLY hard to predict.
-
2:  It is even easier to modify an existing virus that
    used to be 'good' than it is to write a 'bad' virus.
    (not that either one is hard...)
-
3:  In order for your 'GOOD' virus to survive, you must leave
    holes in your security.   These holes are available to
    'bad' viruses as well as yours.
-
4:  There is no need for a virus killer to be self-propagating.
    People are perfectly willing to run the virus-killers by
    themselves.   Inserting the virus-killing code INTO other
    programs serves no purpose.
