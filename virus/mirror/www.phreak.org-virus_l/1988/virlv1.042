     The idea of a CERT team is nothing new.  The Air Force (I
believe) has what they refer to as a "Tiger Team".  Basically they are
specialized in penetration testing.  They will set up a coordinated
effort to get into a computer system and then point out any weak
spots.  This service is also available to the public sector from only
a few companies.
     Using the techniques of computer "hackers/crackers" (Since some
team member ARE ex-hackers/crackers) they will attempt to launch a
full scale attack on your computer system.  When (and if) they gain
entry they will inform you as to where the weak spot was and
suggestions on how to improve security.  This service usually runs for
1 week.
     Another service available is where they will log onto private
electronic bulletin boards and check to see if there is any
information about your system (Dial up #, passwords, etc) on those
boards.  Any such information is sent to the owner for further
actions.  This service usually lasts for one month.
     These people are also available to speak at conferences in the
fields of cowhen
relating to computer "hackers/crackers" and phone "phreaks"
     If anyone is interested in more information, please contact me

Subject:  Paper viri and postage

Regarding the recent messages about a "personals" virus, and the
"caution" slowdown, a wirter in RISKS-FORUM suggested that a really
fiendish virus would be to send out a notification of a really serious
(and totally fictious) virus that was so dangerous you should reformat
*everything* you own, and send away for replacements of *all* your
software.  *But first* spread the message to everyone you know, so
they won't get caught ...

Also, I have had a number of requests from those in the States as to
how to get Canadian postage.  No, the Canadian post office doesn't
accept American postage.  (I have had people send cas in the States.)  As
the international community is aware, there are such things as
"International Reply Coupons" which allow you to, essentially,prepay
the return postage at your post office.

Unfortunately, I do not have access to Quad density disk drives at
home, so you must use 360 or 720 K.

And, I have not received a request in a year and a half for Apple or
Mac format.  I do not think, given how behind I am in just compiling
the stuff, that I can accomodate those requests.

Again, please don't ask for the stuff via email.

Subject:  Sending .arc files from vax/vms to ibm/vm userids

I am a recent subscriber to VIRUS-L and became one because I
discovered the Brain virus on some of my floppies. I've managed to get
a copy of FSP_14.arc from uxe.cso.uiuc.edu via anonymous ftp. I've
also downloaded it onto my PC and have De-Arced the contents and it
runs fine on my PCrd because I live off
campus and there are too many people on campus who are perpetually
logging into his boa rd. He has a VM account (on the IBM 3090) to
which I could send this file if I can determine how. This file is
currently on my VAX/VMS account. I've tried sending it with the
/binary and the /binary/netdata options of the send/file command but
when its downloaded it cannot be de-arced. I was wondering of some one
else encountered this problem and how it could be remedied.  I'm sorry
this doesn't pertain directly to viruses, but there are a lot of
students out there who would benefit greatly if I could make it
available on their BBS. Any help or leads would be greatly
appreciated.

We got a REXX psuedo-compiler, tns besides the all the XMAS EXEC stuff..

   PUSH 'YES'
   'FORMAT 191 A'

Is there a way to fight back? Or should we just don;t run any programs
that appear in the READER??

Subject: Virus Carried by >2400 baud modem carrier

This memo has been distributed at JPL, but I have not run across
mention of the virus anywhere else:

Subject: New Virus
Sender:  David I NAKAMOTO / JPL/01                Contents: 2.

Part 1.

  TO: JEMS / JPL/01

  Part 2.

  There is a new virus out there that is carried on the subcarrier
  of modems running at 2400 baud or higher.  This virus was
  discovered by someone working in a Telecommunications company in
  Seattle.  From my information, this virus is transmitted during a
  binary file transfer and uses the subcarrier to change registers
  inside your modem to spread the virus around.  That's how it
  replicates.  The virapparent cure is to cycle the
  power on the modem or reset the modem registers BY HAND.  To
  prevent the spread of the virus, it is recommended that you use
  300 or 1200 baud only, that you refrain from file transfers, that
  sysops close their file transfer areas, and make backups of your
  hard disk every day in case of infection.

  Four systems are known to be infected with this virus, none on
  lab that I know of.  A possible hardware fix is being developed
  that filters the subcarrier for this virus.
