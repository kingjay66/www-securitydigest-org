      FILECRC calculates CRCs for all files on a disk and records them
      in a file.  COMPARE then compares two such files and reports
      differences, highlighting suspicious changes (file contents
      changed but creation date unchanged).  Useful for spotting viral
      reproduction and/or damage.  This ARC includes source code,
      executables, and documentation for both.  Written by Ted H. Emigh,

FILECRC was originally written to detect damage caused by a program run
amok.  I wanted to use it to detect intentional changes, so I have
enhanced it to defeat some of the simpler antiprotection measures a
virus or Trojan horse might attempt.  FILECRC now calculates a CRC on
its own code to detect possible changes, and calculates CRCs starting
at an offset into each file.  The offset is defined at compile time so
it can be different for each installation.  COMPARE reports files
deleted as well as altered.

Subject:      The Human End of Computer Viruses

(This may be an area that was beaten to death a while ago, so if this is
the case please speak up!)

Has anyone covered the human end of computer viruses?  In particular,
what motivates a person to write a virus or Trojan Horse?  I realize
that challenge and thrill are immediate motivations, but to what extent
do they apply?  Are they the only thing that keeps 'hackers' going?  I
have an idea that these motivating forces may just be the stepping
stones for an interest, and that once into it, the 'hacker' develops
more sophisticated goals to be met, and for reasons that in the past,
perhaps, didn't occur or matter.  I have yet to see any papers
approaching this topic, which tells me that it is either too obvious to
spend time on, or too broad to cover as a topic on its own (obviously it
would be generalized to cover computer crimes in general, not just virus
writing).

Subject:      DCL virus on VMS

Someone asked how the Albany student's virus could have spread without any
specila priveledges. In any large community of users, a number of them will
write their own utilities/programs and share them with other users. An example
here at UF, is the various public access login sequences maintained by
various students for the benefit of the community as a whole. For the
virus to spread rapidly, all that would be necessary would be an infection
of one of these utilities used by many members of the community, then
as the users executed the utility they would infect all of their own files
and presumably any utilities they had written. For anyone familiar with
DCL the program should not pose a problem, in fact the quote of 123 lines
seems inordinately high for such a program.
Possible solutions for VAX managers facing a large community with potential
malcontents include making the default root directory protection no world
read, setting up a dead account to hold utilities submitted by users, and
informing those who do write public utilities to keep the public copy
with the write access disabled.

The article then went on to explain how the student was immediately
restricted, put on probation, and fined 2 grand. That didn't appeal to the
comp center, they got him kicked out. Which makes it clear that (1) it doesn't
matter what your intentions are, only the results, and (2) having slipped up
and let the virus get away, the student shouldn't have reported the problem. I
am sure glad I don't go to that school/work in that comp center/have anything
to do with that crowd. Malicious vengeance breeds in kind. When I was an
undergraduate I and a couple of friends worked many many hours breaking the
security of the departmental minicomputer... with the knowledge of the system
administrator. On those occasions when we managed to crack it we left a note
for the admin somewhere we shouldn't have been able to, and he tried to
figure out (with our help where necessary) a way to plug the revealed security
hole. That was one of the best-run and well-maintained systems I have ever
seen before or since. Now that I am an administrator I would dearly love to
have some users who were that interested and who cared that much about the
system.

Subject:      Policy on Informants

I've just read Bennett Todd's msg (Fri 07 Oct 88 18:42) regarding the
handling of the NY student.  My personal opinion is to totally agree.

Several years ago, some teenagers from a local school found a bug in the
HP 2000 BASIC. Some fool(s) thought it was fun to crash the system every
night 10 minutes before shutdown, and we couldn't trace who caused it.

We were grateful when we were told what was believed to cause it, and
once confirmed, HP fixed their bug, happiness returned. No action.

Some staff here don't believe the students really *do* have enquiring
minds and *can* find holes.  Those who believe, tend to have a more open
attitude, and a colleague has "tame" ones checking out particular areas.
They report on their findings, and he watches in case they go off track.

By all means, hit the *real destructive* types, but fine a *well meaning*
informant and you've built a big wall.  Then they do their best to keep
their activities under a smoke screen on their side, and you're on a
losing streak.                 Peter Morgan.

Scores is a highly infective Mac virus supposedly created as a "killer"
of applications with types "ERIC" or "VULT".

It infects applications and system files and spreads very rapidly.

It can be removed either through some fiddly ResEdit hacking or
through the use of KillScores (recommended) or Ferret (not so
recommended).

Both of these are available from LISTSERV at SCFVM.

I sent private mail about this to some one who asked about it (sorry,
I've forgotten who) ...


SNEAK" detection by Interferon before version 3.1 (now available at
LISTSERV at SCFVM) will detect the LaserWriter and LaserPrep files in
release 6.0 as possibly being infected.


THEY ARE NOT INFECTED !!!!!!

Apple made a change to these files so that they would have new and
different icons. I can explain about all the bizarre things which
the DeskTop file forces you to do when you are changing ICN# resources
if anyone is interested, but it's simply that Apple decided to play
some fun resource games. The new version of Interferon knows about this.

As a note, Interferon is up to version 3.2 (I believe the version being
used by the previous poster was 2.0).

May I add to the list of (very sensible) suggestions two more:

BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU EXECUTE A COMMAND PROCEDURE THAT DOES NOT LIVE IN A
TRUSTED ACCOUNT!  (See below)

NEVER, *EVER* EXECUTE A COMMAND PROCEDURE THAT (A) IS NOT IN A SYSTEM
ACCOUNT AND (B) YOU CANNOT READ, ONLY EXECUTE.  Ask yourself what the
author is hiding by setting access to execute-only.

By "trusted", I mean either a system account or one belonging to a
competent, known, and trusted individual; furthermore, as Les points out,
it behooves the system manager to make sure such trusted accounts are
protected against unauthorized modifications.

As was pointed out earlier, yes, DCL procedures *are* essentially plain
text, so protecting yourself against this sort of virus is easy, *IF* you
follow a few simple rules, such as looking at the code before executing it.
The sad thing is, few people do so.  Just remember CHRISTMA EXEC (similar
in that it was a command-procedure sort of thing, only on IBM systems and
propagating over the network) of last year ...

The punishment of the Albany student was way out of line - a 2K fine
and booting him out of school for a dumb mistake which he
immediately tried to rectify?  When I was in college a few friends
found a way to lock up a 360 system from APL.  Sure we had a little
fun with a systems manager who got bent out of shape but as quickly
as he cooled down, and a few laughs were shared, the code was
revealed and everyone learned something.  Experimenting is how we
learn and in a youthful university environment safeguards must be
put in place so that "creative computing" won't cause harm to needed
functions.  Proactive security by management will be far more likely
to effectively protect than heavy-handed punishments.  Besides, what
19 or 20 year old really expects themself to get caught no matter
how many severe punishments they might hear of...

There were some pretty good descriptions (etc.) of the Brain here on
VIRUS-L over the summer (May and/or June, if memory serves me
correctly).  You might want to start by perusing through the archives.

> Any known carriers, eg PKARC

I don't recall hearing anything about PKARC being a carrier of the
Brain virus (which only infects boot sectors).  Unless anyone else has
more info on this, I assume that it's an unfounded rumor.  Please,
lets not turn VIRUS-L into a place to (even accidentally) start
rumors.

Hello,
        Recently here at the University of Pittsburgh we were infected
with the 'nVIR' virus. It was detected with interferon version 3.00 and
is currently being eradicated. It was first noticed on a MAC II w/80 meg
hard disk. It is known to be in at least 3 of the public labs where macs
are available. Also, it has infected some of the evaluation-only machines
available to faculty members. It is assumed that they have carried the
virus back to their machines. Also, we are checking an evaluation library of
about 150 macintosh packages for infection. We are wondering how to inform
the user-community without panic. Any ideas?

Hi,
I'm wondering if somebody out there in netland can give me a hand with
obtaining some more up-to-date info on the VIRUS-CON.
I sent in my registration back in September and haven't heard nary a word
from anybody since August seeing as how we lost our BITNET connection for
most of September and had to sign off VIRUS-L in August since our accounts
were supposed to undergo a name change that never happened.

According to the info I received from a friend before we got cut off from the
net, I was supposed to receive a information packet through the mail detailing
such things as hotel accomodations, a Conference Schedule, exact location of
the Conference, etc. And at this point, 10 days before its supposed to start, I
'm basically one step short of panic with nothing in hand and no answer to any
of the mail I've sent to the coordinators.

If some kind soul could PLEEZ email me any sort of up-to-date info(Like if its
still going on :> ) I would be greatly appreciative.
Thanx,

How can anyone defend this student when we don't know what his
intentions were?  I agree, the steps taken were drastic, but if virus
writing is an ethical question then why was he writing one in the first
place?  Curiosity is the first thing that comes to mind.  Now...  If it
is curiosity, then by "hacking" he is learning about something that he
would never be taught in school.  Remember the Cohen experiment.
Instead of delving further into research of viruses the admin.  clamped
down immediately.  Over reaction I say, because of fear.  Fear that in
their high positions they may get their privs.  reduced, not really that
it may GET OUT.  I don't know of any virus which can tell what machine
it is on and reproduce accordingly.  I would imagine if such a thing
were ever written that it would defeat the purpose of virus being small
so they can hide.

Anyhow, Greg, why do people write viruses etc?  Curiosity is one.  Media
hype is two.  Revenge is three.  (Vague as always, BSW)

Ps.  The admin.  at Albany should have hired that student as a security

Subject:      *NY Student Caught

The last few days have seen some discussion on this list of the "Albany
incident" which occurred at our site.  Not being a VMS heavy myself, I've
asked my VMS Systems Manager to address some of the specific issues
raised by various correspondents.  She writes:

/ --------------------------------------------------------------- First,
/ Bennett Todd (bet@orion.mc.duke.edu) is very sure our virus contaminator
/ had good intentions because he came to my office to let me know that the
/ virus had "got away".  Detailed examination of the code showed that he
/ was specifically targetting certain usernames (hard coded in) for
/ contamination, and that the main reason he hastened to let me know was
/ that his id and home directory were still hardcoded into the com file
/ which "got away" prematurely, but was always meant to get away.  The
/ system manager for this node would have been -- and remains --
/ interested in a serious security analysis by a serious student.
/ She is not interested in lending credibility to students who write
/ Trojan Horse programs -- in poor DCL at that -- to trip up their
/ unsuspecting friends.
/
/ ----------------------------------------------------------------------
/
/ Now regarding the message from XRAYSROK@SBCCVM:
/
/ 1) Com files are indeed readable ascii files which are coded in DCL
/ (very much like REXX).  As such they are indeed easy to check to see if
/ they contain the lines of code that betray the virus.  That is, ONE com
/ file is easy to check, 4.000 megabytes of files are another matter.  The
/ systems people did run a global search thru the filesystem for the tell
/ tale code. These sanitary measures of course stole cpu and disk from the
/ users.  Part of the payment was to cover such costs.
/
/ 2)  Our "virus" was really a TROJAN HORSE:  many users who were in the
/ habit of using this nasty customer's com files spread the infection to
/ all the files they had WRITE access to (not exe files, the virus just
/ looked for com files, and specifically looked FIRST for the login.com in
/ each user's default directory.)  In fact, as XRAYSROK shrewdly suspects,
/ a bboard (not the one sponsored by the Center, but a student's
/ personal board) was used to spread the virus code.
/
/ 3) Our systems staff are trained to use only code they have checked and
/ tested.  No one with "privs" used the virus com file or the independent
/ board, and so no public files that the Center is responsible for were
/ infected.  No system files were infected.
/
/ 4) About the reason the student came forward, see my reply to previous
/ letter.

What my systems manager does not mention is that all students here are
provided computing access as an entitlement, and in accepting it, agree
not to use it for counterproductive purposes.  Specifically, a student
agrees not to (among other things) not to
  * attempt to interfere with the performance of the system;
  * interfere with the legitimate work of another user;
  * attempt to circumvent system security.
He signs a statement acknowledging that he understands these points and
that nonadherence may result in penalties.

We regard inpenetrable system security as both an unattainable and a
wasteful goal and refuse to use it as a playing field on which to engage
malicious or even curious students.  We simply do not have the resources

------------------
I doubt that this is the result of a virus attack, but I suppose anything
is possible.  The shape of the cursor is something an application may
change, through documented system calls.  Many applications display the
cursor as a block for insert mode, and an underline for overstrike mode.
Other configurations are possible, even a split cursor with a gap through
the middle.  I recall the cursor being affected sometimes when an
application bombed, especially in BASIC, and once in awhile the system
didn't freeze up right away.  "Normal behavior" for this very unusual
household appliance.

I don't know about a virus doing this, but running a CGA program when one's
graphics card is set to monochrome will have the cursor show up like that

I've worked on a turbo-xt that changes the cursor according to the
speed setting.  Some software can't deal with this and screws up the
cursor up on exit.

Assuming that you have a fix for the virus, then you could start by
placing warning messages and signs on any/all of your mainframes
(system bulletins) and in all of your public micro labs.  The signs
should inform the users that there is a virus, what harm (if any) the
virus can do, and how to get rid of it.  Then, make the fix readily
available to all of your users.

That's basically what we did here at Lehigh after some of our student
consultants discovered a virus last Fall.  System bulletins were
issued on all the mainframes, and large, bright signs were placed in
prominent places in all of the microlabs.  A program to remove the
virus was distributed to all of the labs, and made available for
download on all of the mainframes.  Users who were unsure how to
get/run the fix program were told to bring their floppy disks to one
of our sites, where a student consultant would run the fix program for
them, and show them how to run it on their hard drives.  Finally, I
sent a message out on the ADVISE-L forum warning other sites about the
virus, in case it were to spread outside of Lehigh.

Any other ideas or suggestions?

I am already doing that. However, we here at CIRCA do not want to spend
time reinventing the wheel while this (supposedly) benign virus sweeps
over campus. In order to minimize the damage done, we would greatly appreciate
anyone sharing their previous work with us.

What I meant to say is this. The virus spread to us from a local BBS which
had an arced file which when unarced released the initial Trojan that
set the Brain up. Anyone else heard of this? Or are we the victims of a
local virus hacker? (not suprising)

I heartily agree, yet in spite of Mr. Chi's recent posting on this
brouhaha, I still believe that the student's punishment was cruel
and unusual.  Mr. Chi revealed that the student's primary concern
seemed to be that his own directory was threatened by the virus.
However, the student doubtless knew that if he revealed his behavior
to the systems manager, he would probably lose the account anyway.
The wording of his confession "something terrible has happened"
reveals, to this writer, an honest remorse and desire to fix the
problem.

No, the student should NOT be hired as a security consultant.  But
neither is it ethical or fair to make him a nonperson.  Community
service, and a course in business and scientific ethics, seem to
be the ticket here.  It still appears that the student's case appeared
at exactly the wrong time, right after a TIME magazine article which,
although reasonably accurate and well-researched, spread fear among
non-programming computer users as to the safety of their files.  The
case also sets a bad precedent, for real programmers will be at risk
if ethics and law do not discriminate between honest mistakes, negligence,
and malice.  Imagine losing your job over a bug...who said it, in
Shakespeare's King Lear, "use every man according to his deserts,
and who should 'scape whipping?"?

As described in my monthly announcement, you can get the archives by
sending mail to LISTSERV@LEHIIBM1.  Please do *not* send this to
VIRUS-L@LEHIIBM1!  In the message, put any of the following commands:

HELP            - gives you some info on using the LISTSERV.
INDEX VIRUS-L        - lists the files available on the LISTSERV.
GET filename filetype    - sends the requested file to you via e-mail.

The archive files are in the following format:

VIRUS-L LOGyymmw

where yy is the year (88), mm is the month (05, 06, ...), and w is the
week (A, B,...).  For example, VIRUS-L LOG8809A contains the first
week's worth of conversations in September, 1988.  Note that there's a
space between the filename and filetype, not a period like in most
operating systems.

UTEP is a BITNET address for the University of Texas at El Paso
     Computer Center.
UF   is a common abbreviation for the University of Florida.

Given that this is a very international board it would be helpful
if we avoid abbreviations, no matter how common we think they
are.

That's very interesting!   I've never heard of anyone getting it

an ARC file going around the boards that contains a binary dump
of the "Brain", but you'd have to take rather sophisticated

there's really an executable (EXE or COM or...) going around that

Personally, I think that they would ahve been much better off to simply
put the student on Disciplinary Probation, and then given him a job in
the computing center as a consultant.  That is probably what the student
was looking for in the first place, and by his own admission that he wrote
a virus which escaped -- he proved that he does have some responsible bones
in his body.  If he didnt, then he could have simply claimed that a rogue
hacker got into his account, and proliferated a viral program to get him
into trouble -- and no one would have probably been able to prove a thing.

Several years ago, I was introduced to the UNIX system here at my campus
and quickly grew to love it -- the brevity of the commands made it a dream
for someone like me who despises "user friendly" interfaces who assume that
you really dont want to do something that you went to the trouble to key in..
UNIX doesn't bug ya with annoying messages.  Also, it is very secure if
set up in the proper manner....however, several years ago, I accidently
discovered a bug one day when I performed a shell escape from MAIL and created
a temporary message to send to a collegue....the file I created was owned
by ROOT (not my account...) and from this it was relatively easy to obtain
superuser status on the machine.  I went to the system admin. and informed
him of this bug.  We quickly became friends as he saw that I was a responsible
individual, and he made the offer to me that "if I ever wanted superuser
status for *ANY* reason, that he would give it to me...", but that
he would appreciate it "if I were to ask for it, and not simply take it,
because if someone got into my account, then it could create havoc...".  This
request was simple, and I have lived with it for a long time.  We are still
friends, and when I come across a bug or a sec. hole, I tell him.  But if I
had been fined $2K, suspended, and whatever else, then you can bet that the
university would be having some severe problems with getting me to stop
spreading information about all of the bugs.....first ammendment rights
would probably protect me enough so that I could produce a "For Informational
Purposes Only" newsletter about the computing bugs....and as we all are
well aware of -- accounts are VERY easy to come by.

----
Moral of this dialogue?:  Simple really, when you find a hacker -- befriend
him/her/it and try to use it to *YOUR* advantage.  Besides, if the hacker
could program well enough to get in, why not hire the hacker...the hacker
has proven his/her/its capabilities already, and to not utilize them to
the fullest would be foolish...

....*flame off* -- mellow out and give the guy a second chance...

In reply to question about UTEP...

How did that come up?

Anyway, UTEP stands for University of Texas at El Paso (I guess that's
what you mean).  This is as opposed to the University of Texas at Austin,
or UT for short, which is also short for University of Tennessee (at Knoxville)
.  Which is probably why what Ken said makes a lot of sense.  After all, here
in the Southeast, USC often means Univ. of South Carolina, while in California
it means something else.

We're quite often overassuming (is that a word?) on here.  If in the slightest
doubt (and this doesn't just go for college names), spell it out.

Maybe I misunderstood the previous postings, but it sounded to me like the
virus 'got away' while evidence of the author remained in it. On that basis
my immediate suspicion would be that the author knew he would be caught and
hoped that by coming forward he might reduce the unavoidable consequences.

It doesn't sound to me like there was any "honest mistake" involved; he
WAS working on a Trojan Horse (at least, according to these postings), which
just happened to go off before he planned it to.

I don't have the information to say whether I'd be in favour of indefinite
suspension, since there isn't enough detail given about what the Trojan
Horse did to its "recipients", but I'd almost certainly be in favour of
cutting off the guy's computing access.

None of the Mac viruses now known can actively transfer across a network.
If you run a program on a server which is infected, that program can
infect your machine. However, if your machine is infected, it cannot
infect the server. The program MUST be run on the target system to
infect it. Clear? :-)

Gene Lott <GENEL@UNMB> has pointed out to me how a file server could
infect a number of other machines. He is absolutely correct - an infected
server will allow you to infect your machine if you run any of its software
on yours. Also, if a user with write access to the server is infected, the
server can become infected.

The AppleTalk networks I was thinking of were in general simpler ones, without
file sharing or servers - a typical two-Macs-and-a-LaserWriter setup. In this
case, the known viruses will not spread from machine to machine, because
they are unable to use AppleTalk themselves to propagate - they must be
carried by driver (vector? :-) ) software.

To Everyone:

        Help!  My name is Tom Kurke, and I am a consulant at Villanova
University... apparantly we have been infected by some kind of "virus"
"trojan-horse" or something....
        Let me give you the information that I know now.  Apparently,
when using Bank Street Righter, (in our micro-labs, using floppy disks
with hard disk access... dos is on the hard disk), Bank Street Righter
corrupts the information on the data disk- namely, all of the files
are still on the disk (they haven't been written over), but there
are no directory enteries for them.  Stranger than that, if you use Norton
to peek at the FAT sectors and the DIR sectors, you find that in almost
all cases a file has been saved in the DIR area, either in sector 12 or
sector 14, areas reserved specifically for directory information.
        Also, when trying to call the files up using Bank Street Righter,
an "@" appears in the upper right hand corner, or a date like 6/11/88.
Any information that you can provide me about this would be greatly appreciated.

        I am not one who knows much about Bank Street Righter- nor how it
saves files, but does this sound like a viral attack or just a hacker
doing something to corrupt our copies of Bank Street Righter?

        Any information that you can provide me with will be greatly
appreciated... thank you!

But, by the same token, to give the student a job as a consultant, or

I would like to share a similiar situation, as far as hiring a student
who is known to have done questionable activities on a computer.
Back when we had a dec 2060, a high school student discovered that he
could advise the operator console from a batch file, an obvious security
problem.  He then used the operator privs to discover the passwords for
all of the priveleged accounts.  We decided that the best move was to reset
all of the passwords for all of the accounts which became a very uncomfortable
situation on the entire campus.  We were finally able to catch this individual
the second time he tried the same trick.  Our user services manager had a talk
with this individual and felt that this person could be trusted since he was
only experimenting with a main frame.  This manager hired the student when
he began to attend classes at this university.  The student was hired on as
a user assistant, a student worker who is available outside the hours of
8-5 for students unfamiliar with the use of computers.  With this job he given
an account with few resource restrictions, but no privs (at least some
intelligence had been shown up to this point).  When the student was promoted
a year later to problem analyst, which is essentially a first defense for
staff members, he gained access to an account with limited privs.  The student
then used these privs to begin to learn how to bypass accounting records of his
activities.  The first time he caught doing this, this institution gave him a
verbal slap on the hands, yet continued to show their good will and trust by
letting the situtation end at that.  The student was again caught doing the
activities as before when he had unsuccessfully attempted to update his
accounting records on all three of the main frames we had at the time.
Finally, the student was brought before a university review board and
suspended for one year from this university.

In summation, it has been my experience that once someone is let off too
easily from a major offense, that this individual will be unable to find
a reason to discontinue his activities.  He will only feel that it is more
exiting, and that he only needs to be a little more careful next time.
Thus, a feeble attempt in discipline may only lead to a potentially
greater risk in the future.

I apologize for the long letter, but this is a very embarassing situation for
the university and those of us who maintain the computers for the academic
environment.

Disclaimer: These views are entirely from my own viewpoint and no one else's.
            At the time of these activites, I was in no way responsible for
            hiring and firing, nor I was I responsible for the security or
            maintainance of these mainframes.

That seems strange to me.  It seems that in any system, if a file is
writable, then a virus can write to it.  Of course, if read-only
status can be enforced, then infection of the file can be prevented.

Thus, only if a server file is read-only, and NO code in the local
machine can write to the server, is the obove true.

Any comments?

    That is quite a strong generalization.  Your experience with just one
    person has condemned all.  This might even be correct in a majority
    of cases, but not always.  Some people do learn from their mistakes.
    Oh, and by the way, I think the fault when when the University didn't
    do anything to make him realize it was serious the first time he
    tampered with the accounting.  Just in case you don't know, many
    past hackers work for large corporations or the government as informants
    on with security

Are you sure that's not Bank Street Writer?  Anyway, it sounds to me like a
perfectly ordinary bug in the program.  Contact the author or get another copy
of the program from a completely different source (like the author) and see
if the two programs are the same size and behave the same way.  Do a DIFF on
the two programs.

If they are identical and both corrupt data, it is most likely a bug.
If they are different, than one of three things has happened:  you have a
buggy file, a file which was corrupted during transmission by line noise
or a file which has been deliberately modified to be hostile.

The last of those is the least likely, and the first the most likely.  Most
programs that trash data have bugs.

Does anyone have any evidence (there I go again!) that this is
really true?   It's certainly "common knowledge", and it happens
constantly in paperback novels, but the few actual security managers
that I've mentioned the subject to have generally laughed at the

On the idea that hackers can and. or should be
hired as security consultants:

In the not-so-old days when competent computer people
were hard to come by, It made sense to hire hackers
to help your security effort.  The extra effort to
control them and the leap of faith required were made
worthwhile, because of the limited pool of talent
available.   I do not think this is true anymore.

It IS still true that hackers may be an important
source of talent, IF you have the resources to control
them, or a loose enough situation to prevent severe dammage.
If, as in most places I've been, you can't spare the
effort, I'd still say that a first offence ought to result
in forced restitution and a real short chain.  Class this as
stupidity, rather than malice.   A second offence is evidence
of both stupidity AND severe mental defectiveness,
and ought to get a body bounced as high as you can
get them.

Subject:      Macintosh network exposure to viruses

The generally imprecise use of terminology in network discussion may
mislead persons discussing the potential for spread of viruses on
Macintosh networks.

"Appletalk" is a generic name for a suite of protocols defined by Apple
Computer.  The suite of protocols, in and of themselves, provides very
little applications level service.  Useful applications are built on top
of the Appletalk protocols.  For example, Laser printing service and
network dot matrix printing.  To share data one must add additional
software.  Two very common products to accomplish this are AppleShare and
TOPS.  Using these as our models we can talk about network exposure to
viral contamination.

First.  If a virus is written to use low level appletalk protocols directly
to spread a virus from an infected host, I believe that the target machine
would have to be running software beyond the low level protocol suite.  Some
examples would be disk sharing software or email software.  We are now talking
about a very sophisticated (and probably very large virus).  Note that the
requirement of higher level software is a premise and not an established fact.

Second.  A virus that interacts with disk media at the read/write block
level probably cannot propagte via read/write block over the network.
Again this is a premise not a verified conclusion.

If one accepts these premises, network exposure to viruses falls into two
classes.

Class B (banal).  If one is running disk or file sharing software and executes
a virus vector on the local machine, then the local machine is at the same
level of risk that it assumes if the executable application were resident.
This statement also applies to trojans and generally buggy software and is
a tribute to clean design and accurate coding of the Macintosh OS and Appletalk
protocol suite.

Class A (awful).  The typical virus assumes a domain of addressable files
(volumes only if one accepts low level read/write which I do not).  If an
infected host has in its domain of addressible files, a subset that is
addressable by other, uninfected, clients of the network, then the network
should accelerate the spread of the virus.  My premise, not verified
conclusion, is that many disk/file sharing applications on Appletalk are
very clean implementations and present a "local disk" image to applications
that avoid low level read/write.

Tentative conclusions.
The risk is real and must be assessed against the benefits of the network.
Network administrators (and under tops individual clients) should develop
a strategy to determine the scope of files that are addressable by others
and the permisions granted to these persons.

Obvious(?) techniques to reduce exposure.
1.  Don't permit access to a system folder by other than the local machine.
2.  Where practical, make executable applications read only.
3.  Try to limit write access to shared domains to data files only.

If any one is able to confirm or invalidate any of my premises, I would be
very grateful to them.

There is an important differance between network drives and local
drives. To use DOS as an example, when a program wants to write to
a file it calls INT 21 with subfunction 40h (Write to file or device).
DOS will then determine what type of device the file is on. If the
device is a network drive, DOS will hand off the request to the network
software. But if the device is a local disk, DOS will call INT 26h
(Absolute disk write) to write the data to disk.
     The (c) Brain virus called INT 26h directly, so it can't infect
a network drive. This is the blessing/curse of machine dependent code!

Subject:      Move discussion on virus writers

I suggest we move discussion on rewards and/or penalties and/or
excommunication for virus writers to a more appropriate list
ETHICS-L and reserve this list for matters of a more technical
nature.

ETHICS-L is moderated by Harry Williams (HARRY@MARIST) and is
described as being to : "delineate and discuss the basic issues and
hot areas in computer ethics.  Topics include ownership of
information, who is responsible for program failures, how much
privacy is reasonable.  Students are welcome to participate."  The
preceding was plagiarized in toto without permission from a listing
on my desk from whence I know not where it came.

I don't get it.  How can showing an intrest in things imply malice.
Unfortunately I still believe people are not inately evil.  If computer
science has this Calvinistic attitude for long, we'll never see
innovation or advance again.

Interesting, however the virus can call the same routines that the DOS
server does.  Thus, only if the server file is read-only AT THAT END
can you be sure that a virus cannot infect the server.  If code at the
user end can write to the server, in any way, then a virus code can do
the same.  Read-only files, protected at the server end where the
virus is assumed not to reside, are protected.

(as an aside, we have moved the discussion from MAC to DOS here, we
also are discussing what a virus can do, not what known viruses
actually do.  I for one am discussing potential and not existing
threats.)

Subject:      employing ex-hackers

To answer DC's question about ex-hackers working for large
corporations or the government.  Yes, I have evidence and
can confirm that statement for you.  However, the ones that
I am aware of work as informants, not as "regular" employees.
They continue to be active in the hacker's world, but they in
turn supply information to the gov't or large corporations.

On other matters it has been interesting to read the various
"harsh punisments result in halted activity" arguments.  This
too seems to be a popular notion but is on shaky theoretical and
empirical grounds.  But then I'm a criminology graduate student
so I guess I'm "into" such things.  :-)
