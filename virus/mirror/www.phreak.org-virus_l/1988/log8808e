Subject:      Losing more than data...


Hi folks,

all of us are afraid in some sense of what viruses *can* do. Sometimes it
seems as if viruses make a computer system vulnurable as never before.
Although this may not be correct I think most of us have thought of the
possible harm on people if a viruses hit a computer system. So many people
on this list talked about the tragic of losing data and/or programs. But
what is the loss of (even valuable) data compared with the death of a human
being caused by an erratic computer system in a hospital? To see this is not
a fiction, have a look at the following (words CAPSed by me):

Can anybody on this list confirm this?  Anyway, I think we will have some new
topics for further discussions:

  -  What mental diseases drive a programmer to design a virus that will
     hit a hospital computer system?
  -  If a person is being killed by computer (re-)action caused by
     a virus: Is sHe (the programmer) a murderer?
  -  How should computers be used in environments like a hospital while
     a secure computer system (resistant against viruses) is not available?

Waiting for appropriate answers,
Bernd.

Hopefully if person A unwittingly supplies a virus to person B, he won't
be assumed guilty merely because he is a capable assembly programmer.
Then burden of proof SHOULD be on the plaintiff.  Knowledge of program-
ming skills would be purely circumstantial (I think).

Loren and everyone:
I'm perhaps a bit paranoid about money, but I make it a point NEVER to
send money to an unincorporated individual via a P.O. Box for something
of which I have no proof or receipt.  So if registering for your confer-

it.  If you can provide a more reasonable method, I'd love to come.

  I challenge Loren to defend the claim that a CRC scheme is inferior to an
encryption scheme.
  But first, let's get one thing clear.  Opinions on the merits of CRC differ
widely, and I think this is due almost entirely to the fact that different
people mean different things when they speak of CRC.  For purposes of checking
whether a file has been corrupted while sent over a communications line, CRC
with a *standard* generating polynomial, usually the CCITT polynomial, is used.
However, when a checksum (or signature) algorithm, CRC or otherwise, is used for
detecting viral infections, the first requirement, in order to minimize the
likelihood of forging the checksum, is that (for any given file) it should yield
a *different* checksum when used by different users.  In the case of the CRC
algorithm, this ordinarily means that instead of using a *fixed* generator for
all users, that polynomial must be chosen *personally* by each user or *random-
ly* by the program when the database of checksums is first created for that
user.
  Given satisfaction of this requirement, I challenge Loren to produce explicit
reasons why a program based on a CRC algorithm is any worse, from a practical
point of view, than one based on "DER" [DES?].  And similarly for anyone else
who thinks the same of RSA or any other cryptographic algorithm.  And if anyone
can come up with such a reason, let him explain why such an algorithm is *suffi-
ciently* better than CRC to justify the *much greater execution time* required.

  It should be pointed out that *no* checksum algorithm, no matter how sophisti-
cated, will provide dependable detection of viral infection unless certain loop-
holes are blocked by the program utilizing that algorithm.  I know of three such
loopholes and I know of only one program which satisfies the above requirement
and which blocks all three loopholes.  (I suspect that even Fred Cohen's RSA-
based program [1] doesn't do this, and that even with his latest techniques for
reducing execution time, a CRC-based program will still run considerably fas-
ter.)

In-Reply-To:  Message of 28 Aug 88 21:35 EDT from "Loren K Keim -- Lehigh
              University"


I am not sure that we have the correct question here.  The question is
not so much "who is safe" as it is "how is safe."  If viruses were hard
to come by, we should not bother to have this discussion.  It is a
little silly to say that anyone has a proprietary right to the Lehigh
virus.  If people were trying to maintain their proprietary rights in
viruses, there would not be a problem.

The question is, how can qualified academics exchange sufficient
information about the nature of specific viruses without contributing to
the problem?  I hope that we can agree that distributing live viruses by
this network is not appropriate.

Three ideas occur to me. 1) Know who you are talking to.  Before sending
a virus to anyone, be certain that you know who they are.  They can
advertise their interest (even in the network), and credentials.  You
can check those credentials with others.  You can verify the address.

2) Carefully label the virus.  Part of the problem with viruses results
from the fact that they do not advertise their purpose and intent in
their names and documentation.  To label them is, at least partially, to
disarm them.

3) Sterilize them or disarm them before sending them.  The academic is
interested in how the virus is designed to behave.  It is useful to
preserve that information.  However, it is not necessary to preserve the
behavior to do that.  If you are able, disarm the virus before sending.
If you are not, best leave the forwarding to someone who is.  Simply
destroy the virus.  If yours is the last copy, you are a hero.  If not,
someone qualified to disarm it will likely see it.

Others can surely add to this short list.

All that having been said, I think that a demonstration is required of
those who assert that this traffic is necessary.  We have seen excellent
expositions in this forum of all of the necessary information to deal
with particular viruses.  I would assert that those expositions told me
everything that I needed to know, even everything that I needed to write
a specific antidote, without preserving the behavior of the virus.
While I acknowledge that not just anybody could have done the necessary
analysis or written those
expositions, and it is necessary to deliver the virus to those that can,
I would hope that we can limit the traffic to the absolute minimum
necessary to accomplish that.  If the exposition has been done, further
distribution of that virus can only be justified by morbid curiosity.

Re: Distribution of viruses/accountability/liability

Mr. Murray madr excellent points concerning the compromise of
security by even the people who work as security managers. The
more people who have access to the "live" viruses, the more likely
that there will be a leak.

Most of the security mangagers are probably themselves trustworthy
(I hope. :-)) but then what each manager's computers, buildings,
support staff, etc.? The potential for unintentional leaks persist;
the only sure preventive is not having the viruses there period.
The more people undertaking to study and develop means of countering
viruses (which is definitely needed), the risks increase.

Then, even with otherwise respectable people, there is always a
possibilty that someone will have a "price" that will suffice to
encourage them to "leak" the viruses. The price could be monetary
or ideological. I have a mental scenario that illustrates this
situation. Let's say that a manager of Irish-American background
were approached by several "interests". Each one sought to use
viruses as a weapon again their "target" computers. The manager
refuses and most likely passes on information about such "offers" to
security agencies, FBI, NSC, whatever. Then someone from the IRA
came up and suggests the need for hitting the computers used by
MI6 or the Royal Ulster Constabulary. The manager's principle MAY
come under more severe test now. (This scenario is not to pick on
the Irish or any particular group. Most people have a vulnerable
area. Hopefully, integrety will win out. For myself, I can admit that
I probably would shed little tears if a computer system used by the
PLO or by a neo-Nazi group was hit by a virus. But I also realize the
gigantic dangers of "firing the first salvo" inthe world.) Yes, this
scenario resembles something out of a "spy thriller" but it serves as
an apt warning about human weaknesses. Of course there are other
factors that can encourage leaks. Greed and revenge are all time
classics.

The danger exists. The more like hazard still is a leak by employess,
cleaning personell (yes this can happen if the systems are not well
secured, burglers carting off the PC's, etc. It is even worsened
when the viruses are given to newsmen. (Although my secondary job is
along those lines, I agree about the dangers expressed by Loren.)
There are all too many curiousity seekers out there as well; people
who want a virus as a "throphy".

Subject:      RE: CRC vs. encryption schemes

Y. Radai asks why CRC checking, given the requirement that:

        [The] polynomial must be chosen *personally* by each user or *random-
        ly* by the program when the database of checksums is first created for
        that user.

is not as good as a DES- or RSA-based checksum.

The answer is:  It depends on the model you are concerned with.  But before we
even get to that, you CANNOT choose any old "random" polynomial - you have to
choose one from an appropriate class.  This is not hard to do; the theory
is worked out in a paper of Rabin's, "Fingerprinting With Random Polynomials"
or some such.  (Sorry, I don't have the reference; it probably appeared in a
STOC or FOCS 3-4 years ago.)  Note that to get reasonable security, you need
a moderately large polynomial, so your software implementation may not be as
fast as you thought it would be.

As for the model:  A CRC scheme assumes that your opponent cannot see the
result of applying your CRC.  CRC is not (known to be) "crypto-secure":  It
may very well be that, given a program P and its CRC C, with an unknown
polynomial, I can find another program P' with the same CRC.  Note that this
is a MUCH weaker condition than saying that I can determine the polynomial.
In fact, the real situation may be that I cannot be CERTAIN that P' will
work, but that probabilistically it's a good bet.

Given a properly-constructed cryptographic checksum, such as the DES checksum,
even if I can CHOSE a large sample of programs P1,...,Pn and get you to hand
me their checksums, I still can't find any other program P' with the same
checksum as any of the Pi's - unless I know the key you are using.

Is this important?  It depends on the situation.  Using CRC, you can NEVER
publish lists of checksums.  With DES, you can do so safely.  Only people to
whom you have given your key will be able to do anything useful - or nasty -
with the published information.

It's possible construct even stronger checksums:  Those which cannot be
spoofed EVEN BY SOMEONE KNOWING THE KEY.  This is easy to do using a technique
that, unfortunately, makes the checksum as large as the information being
protected:  An RSA signature will do quite nicely.  Whether there is a way
to do this with a small checksum, I don't know.

Re: Limiting dist of viruses as protection for computer professional

While there is legitimacy for a very limited distribution of viruses
for study by a limited number of professional, limiting the distribu-
tion of viruses, beside protecting the world in general, also protects
computer professionals who might otherwise keep a virus or two around.

A story from my college days when I worked on summer as a porter
(translate that as a janitor) in a hospital. One day, the housekeeping
staff had accidentally locked themselves out of the laundry room and the
washing machine was going amok- overflowing with sudsy water. The water
and suds were coming out from under the door. I offer to try to open
the door using a couple of methods that I had heard of. One of the
houskeepers warned me not to do it. Rather, she suggested, let the
flooding continue until the hospital got a locksmith. The reason is that
if I suceeded opening the door, it would be viewed that i "knew locks".
So, then, if anything was stolen, if any drugs disappeared, or any
equipment vanished, I would have been the prime suspect. And this
was not a matter of "pikuach nefesh", of life or death. So I followed
the advice.

Her advice stuck with me over the years. It also applies to computer
data security issues. If I kept viruses and something happend in
my area of New Jersey, I could be viewed as a suspect. It has been
hazardous enough for being known as an authorof articles about viruses.
(One BBS sysop claimed that my text was a "virus" because his BBS
crashed soon after I uploaded an ASCII file of one of my articles. Guilt
by association.) So all the better not to have the "live samples" unless
one is REALLY part of the solution.

Addenum to previous posting of accountability....

Another problem in distributing viruses is the problem of verifying
who the "security professionals" making requests are. E-mail can
be deceptive. Same for letters, phone calls, etc. Face to face contact
helps, but all too often there is great amount of uncertainty. This
uncertainty can be reduced by further follow-up checks, but the risk
in never eliminated totally. In reading about security risks elsewhere,
I have come across a number of examples of "spoofs" where someone was
induced to work for the KGB or other agencies by the agency presenting
itself as some other group- CIA, MI5, Mossad, etc. Again, these are
extreme cases. But they illustrate how often people will only do
shallow checks. Incidentally, a corpate/ government letterhead is not
absolute proofof "genuiness" either. One can always form a "dummy"
corporation and the print shops can always prepare a letterhead of
any design. There is even the danger of an employee of legitimate
cancerns with their own "adgenda". It is a very complicate world out
there.

Again, Mr. Murray thank you. PS, Mr. Murray, I'll be getting in
contact with you about the question concerning FIDONET that you
asked before the Fred Cohen lecture in July.

If a disk has a volume label, CHKDSK will count that as a hidden file.
Could this be the "unidentified" hidden file?

Or at least it was out of print at the beginning of this summer when I

Subject:      Outline of Worm Pgms Paper in CACM

While not wanting to help bury Loren with yet another copy of the paper
"The 'Worm' Programs: Early Experiences with a Distributed Computation"
(in CACM March 1982, pp.172-180), as I am sure that more than 1 copy is
now winging its way there, I thought that others on this list might be
interested to peruse the outline of this paper, together with an
annotation or two. (Whew!)

(Incidentally, John Brunner's "The Shockwave Rider" is referenced
therein as well as "The Adolescense of P1" and one I hadn't heard of,
"The Medusa Conspiracy" by Ethan I. Shedley.)

1   Introduction       - distinguishes so-called "distributed computing"
                         from worms - "distributed *computations*"
2   Building a Worm    - worm: a computation which lives on 1 or more
                         machines; the program on each machine is termed
                         a "segment"
2.1 General Issues in  - authors emphasize that since the worm *takes
    Construcing A Worm   over* the host machine, any disk residing on
                         that machine should not be written on; doing so
                         is labelled as a "profoundly antisocial" act
2.2 Starting a Worm    - on 1-st machine, worm is started as would be
                         any other program
2.3 Locating Other     - worm expands to its full complement of machines
    Idle Machines        using *only* idle machines (say, overnight)
2.4 Booting an Idle    - the architecture of the network (ethernet)
    Machine              is such that an idle machine (running a memory
                         diagnostic test pgm) can be requested to boot
                         from the network, but control cannot be seized
2.5 Intra-Worm Communication:
    The Need for Multi-Destination Addressing
                       - problem of co-ordinating which machines are
                         currently still part of the worm; time-out and
                         labelling a non-communicative segment as not
                         part of the worm any more
2.6 Releasing Machines - memory diagnostic is re-started; noted that if
                         segment or boot fails, the machine is effectiv-
                         ly cut out of the network (stopped)
3   A Key Problem:     - puzzling situation recounted: a small worm left
    Controlling a Worm   running overnight resulted in a dozen machines
                         "dead" the next morning; a corrupted copy of
                         the worm was failing in the boot sequence;
                         some machines were physically locked up and
                         running the worm and thus could not be aborted;
                         luckily, an emergency escape had been included
                         within the worm, so that it could be shut down;
                         "...unfortunately, the embarassing results were
                         left for all to see: 100 dead machines scatter-
                         ed around the building..."
4   Applications Using the Worms
4.1 The Existential Worm    - this program simply stayed alive
4.2 The Billboard Worm      - distributed a "cartoon of the day"
4.3 The Alarm Clock Worm    - used to signal a user at a later time; not
                             dependant upon a single machine; would dial
                             up user's telephone!!!
4.4 Multimachine Animation  - a single controlling node using other
    Using a Worm              machines to multi-process the graphics
                              problem at hand, generating animation
                              effects
4.5 A Diagnostic Worm for   - testing pair-wise communication error
    the Ethernet              rates for networks of 120 machines, using
                              a single controlling node
5  Some History: Multi-Machine   - routing algorithm (IMPs); McRoss;
   Programs on the ARPANET         the "Creeper"; "much of this work,
                                   however, was done in the early '70s"
6  Conclusions

Although "worms" sound as nefarious as viruses I would suggest that they
are something completely different. For one thing, the computing
environment required is different than that in which viruses are being
found today. For another, far from having an "infection" it sounds as
though worms will need to utilise network calls to install themselves.
This implies a far greater measure of control over the resources that
a worm would be able to command.

Anyway, this hopefully will encourage those interested to truck on down
to the library for this article.

Bernd,

I have not heard of the specific incident you cited about a virus
attacking a hospital, but have heard of at least 6 more incidents.
None of the incidents were very dangerous to patients, but were
apparently written to attack a specific hospital system.  I think
it takes a very sick human being to attack such systems.

Jeff,

Surprizingly, you are the very first person to ask about the
integrity of the individual vs the company.  I agree with you,
there is very little I can do here to prove that I am being
honest and won't run off with your money.  I will provide receipts
to people along with hotel names and so on (I had already
planned on this, and even picked up a receipt book!), and you
should write in the Memo section of your check (most checks have
these) that it is a registration fee for a virus conference,
include a letter and keep a xeroxed copy of it.  If you are really
worried, then mail yourself a xeroxed copy of the letter the same
day you send me a check and don't open the letter.

Incidently, an individual is much easier to sue than a company.
A company can just dissolve or declare bankrupcy.  You can put
a lien on my property (THAT IS NOT A SUGGESTION!).  And you will
get a cancelled check, which is evidence itself.

NSC:

When I speak of the NSC (which individuals have talked to
me and identified themselves as being from this organization),
I ASSUME it is the National Security Council (Is that last
word Council?) under Pres. Reagan.  I am in NO WAY certain this
is who I talked to.

When I refer to the National Computer Security Center, I am
referring to an entirely different group.

DES:

I MEANT DES, not DER... I make that mistake often.

William H. Murray:

Thank you, you pointed out a few things that I missed.  I neglected
to say anything about sterilizing viruses before sending them anywhere.
Its common practice, so it was something I overlooked.

Bob and others:

Wasn't Miami U telling us several months back that they had been
hit by a virus which attacked Word Perfect?  (Who has a problem
with Word Perfect?  Its a good and inexpensive word processor!)


Thank you,

The check to a P.O. box is definitely out of the question, unless you
could provide a name of a reputable sponsor of the conference I could
contact.  Who is sponsoring the conference?

I am also curious as to whether there will be profits, and if so, what
will become of them.  Obviously, you can't give a definite answer as to
whether the fifty dollars apiece will be too much or too little at this
stage.  Have you had any experience organizing conferences?

I would like to know what your status is at Lehigh, and to what extent
Lehigh University is involved.  Also, how many people have sent checks?

Perhaps with this information, I would consider attending.

I read that book when it first came out. While the virus stuff is reasonably
accurate (the AI part is junk), my impression of the book was that it was
badly written and not immensely gripping. Still, it has been ten years or so,
so I could be wrong...

Loren is an undergraduate student here at Lehigh, in good academic

is not involved in the conference in any way.  At least the Computing

Yesterday, I was calling up this area's local BBS's, when to my
surprise, I found a feud going on.  One BBS sysop claims that a second
sysop is responsible for a virus that he somehow got.  Since FluShot
gave the receiving sysop an error message (which probably is common,
but he doesn't realize that) he feels that the virus can be traced to
the host sysop's BBS and therefore is seeking damages.. The host sysop
claims that if he is being accused and wrongly slandered that he would
consult legal authorities at his business.  I am not sure if all the
details here are 100% accurate, but I can upload a copy of the messages
in the feud here if some people are interested.

Subject:      CRC vs. encryption schemes

  A few comments on Jerry Leichter's reply to my question/challenge:

>It may very well be that, given a program P and its CRC C, with an unknown
>polynomial, I can find another program P' with the same CRC.  Note that this
>is a MUCH weaker condition than saying that I can determine the polynomial.

Agreed.  I never assumed that one had to determine the polynomial in order to
forge a CRC.  However, it's not enough to say that "it *may* be that ...".  If
you can't demonstrate a *method* for doing this in general, you won't convince
many people.  So for sake of argument, I shall assume you have in mind some-
thing like the method described by Woody Weaver in his May 17 contribution to
VIRUS-L.  If so, where do you get the set of polynomials gi(x) from?  It would
clearly be impractical to take it to be all possible polynomials (even assuming
you know the size of the generator).  So do you simply choose (say) 100 poly-
nomials at random, apply Woody's procedure, and hope for the best?  That would
take a lot of computation time, which would certainly be noticed.  And even if
it isn't, if the probability of succeeding isn't sufficiently large, the CRC
checker will sometimes notice your attempted forge, tipping off the community
to the existence of a virus.  Can you supply any assurance that this probability
will be large?  And if you are thinking of some quite different method of
forging the CRC, could you please explain it?

>                  you CANNOT choose any old "random" polynomial - you have to
>choose one from an appropriate class.

For reasons mentioned above, I think your words "CANNOT" and "have to" are a
bit too strong.  Anyway, I presume you're referring to a restriction on the set
of polynomials (from which the generator is randomly chosen) to the subset of
*irreducible* polynomials.  The reason I didn't mention this in yesterday's
message was that I considered this to be a relatively minor matter compared to
the distinction between a fixed generator and a personal/random generator.
(Recall that the requirement which you quoted was described by me as the *first*
requirement, not the *only* requirement.)
  Since I may have misunderstood something and this might be a more important
point than I thought, it should be mentioned that a CRC checker (the same
program which I mentioned in my message yesterday) has been written which
makes a random choice among almost 70 million irreducible polynomials.  Do you
think anyone can forge a checksum on that basis?  This program is based essen-
tially on Prof. Michael Rabin's "fingerprint" algorithm, and as you yourself
admitted in your contribution of May 9, that makes it cryptographically strong
despite the fact that it is CRC-based.

  Perhaps I could rest my case here, but there are a a couple of additional
details:

>                              Note that to get reasonable security, you need
>a moderately large polynomial, so your software implementation may not be as
>fast as you thought it would be.

The above program uses a 31-bit generator and is at least as fast as any other
checksum program I have tried (except for FluShot+, which probably uses some-
thing more primitive than CRC; in any case it doesn't satisfy my "first" re-
quirement).

>                                                  Using CRC, you can NEVER
>publish lists of checksums.

Since use of a CRC algorithm for the detection of viral infection (which is the
only context in which I mentioned CRC) doesn't imply the need for such a list,
this remark doesn't seem to me to be relevant to my question.  But I'm still
curious to know exactly how one would exploit a list of CRC checksums to do
something nasty.

  In short, Jerry, I don't think you've succeeded in supplying any good justifi-
cation for the much greater execution time required for DES- and RSA-based
algorithms as compared to a Rabin-type CRC algorithm, and unless I've missed
some important point, not even compared to an ordinary CRC algorithm satisfying
my "first" condition.

Your point is certainly a valid one.  Virtually any programmer with ill will
toward an organization or institution could formulate a virus in a few hours
(or a poorly constructed virus in less time) and crash that system should it
have weak defenses.  It's distrubing to think that such vengeful persons
can easily bring about "viral warfare."  That brings me to another point,
if a war should take place (sensibilities forbiding), how prominently would
viruses be used as a means of attacking an enemy?  This sounds like the plot of
 a cheesy film, but anything's possible.

Subject:      Who's Sponsoring What

Thank you for answering Ken, but please do not answer questions
you know little about before consulting me.

The conference is sponsored at this time by two organizations
within Lehigh, and I am trying to get a department to sponsor
the conference.  I will be able to tell you later this week
who you may contact within Lehigh for information.

Agreeing with Ken, I am enrolled in the undergraduate program
at Lehigh.  I dislike the term undergraduate because I have worked
in the field for over 6 years and had taken courses at schools
previous to attending Lehigh.  Undergraduates, unfortunately,
often are thought of as people who don't know anything and haven't
spent time working in the real world, so I continue to shy
away from that label.

If you question my integrety, you can check up on me.  I was
a member of the Bethlehem Beautification Committee, a part of
a group to the Bethlehem Area School District Superintendant
Committee, and have served on many non-profit organizations.
I was one of the people who started the "Save our Statue"
fund about 6 years ago that obtained national status.
I am easy to contact through any of the Century 21 Keim
Realtor offices in the Lehigh Valley area, Keim Enterprises.

While all of this means practically nothing, I like to
think I have a decent reputation for being fair and so
on.

I am using a P.O. Box because it is easier for me to
separate mail that way.  If you so desire, I live at
1950 Ravenwood Drive in Bethlehem (Zip 18018).

Again, its very hard for me to assure you that I am
"on the level".  I think tommorrow I may be in a better
position to discuss it, however.

If you have any specific questions, you can direct them
to me here at LKK0@LEHIGH.

Subject:      Virus Conference Concerns Update

To answer some of the concerns people recently had here about
the virus conference:

As I had said before, we were being sponsored by two Lehigh
University organizations but not by the college itself.  We
are working on trying to get the university to sponsor the
conference at this time.  We should know in the next few
days the answer.   The major concern the University seems
to have is that Lehigh must maintain the highest possible
standard of professionalism at a conference, as any
college or university should.

If we are sponsored by Lehigh, then those of you who might
have had questions about integrety will be able to send
a check directly to Lehigh.

Other than that, we seem to have a great list of speakers,
panelists and others coming representing a wide variety
of computer security experts and amatuers.

I will keep you informed.

Thank you,

CRC stands for Cyclic Redundancy Check.
CACM is the "Communications of the Association for Computing Machinery."
DER, as far as I know, was an error for DES.  Don't flame me if I'm wrong;
there's getting to be a lot of mail and little time to read it.

Dueling Sysops.  Sounds like a song subject.
Maybe this question has already been brought up but I'm curious what people's
thoughts are on the subject.  In a recent issue of Computerworld, the subject
of viruses and how they fit into insurance costs was raised.  On one hand,
those paying the insurance feel that they should be compensated for their
losses to viruses since they're paying high bills.  Insurance companies,
though, feel they shouldn't have to pay for another person's behavior.  The
article listed a few companies that do have provisions for viruses and those
who are undertaking the task.  I'll put them up if anyone wants them.

Steve,

Your suggestion about spelling abbreviations on first use is a good one.  It
is a fairly well recognized standard for reports, etc., and is a good idea
for here.  Only the most EXTREMELY common abbreviations should not be done
this way, at least on the first use.  In reply chains, this should probably
not be necessary.  I, too, am not familiar with all the jargon and abbrev-
iations such as DES.  I do know what CRC stands for, although I don't know
how to use it.

By the way, CACM stands for Communications of the Association for Computing
Machinery (ACM).  This is the primary journal of the ACM.

   I really cannot understand all the fuss about whether Loren is on the
up and up.  There is not a shred of evidence for, and it is ridiculous to
suggest, that Loren might perhaps embezzle the funds for the conference
and skip town.  The conference money is not very much compared to the
loss of reputation, risk of a law suit, and other damages certain to be
incurred by such a fraud.  I would however suggest (Loren probably already
knows this) that a bank account be established solely for handling the
conference expenses and that Loren obtain and retain all recipts for all
conference-related expenditures.  This is good insurance against later
accusation.  The question about left over monies is a good one, but also
what about not enough funds?  I think Loren deserves to be thanked for
his efforts in setting up and running the conference.  Unfortunately, I
am too busy to attend.

   Life is full of risks and if you want to live a full and normal life
(maybe even otherwise also), you are forced to take at least some risks
all the time.  So, you take risks you consider to be reasonably safe.
It is always possible that your next door neighbor will run you down with
his car just for the fun of it the next time he sees you.  It is possible
that the cashier will pocket the $20 bills you just handed her and claim
that you didn't give her anything (and charge you with assault or robbery
should you try to get your money back).  But life is always forcing these
kinds of risks on you and you must evaluate each risk and the motives and
psychological make up of the people involved.  It has been said that if
you don't take risks, you risk not living.  I personally think the
conference is a pretty good risk.  And a cancelled check is a pretty good
receipt.

Perhaps we have two different concerns here.  One is the problem of
determining if a file that was previously clean had become infected.
For this one needs only to look for changes.  A CRC will do this,
unless the infecting agent is 'smart' enough to add a byte or two of
checksums that will cause the CRC generator to show the same CRC.  No
virus writer can do this if he does not know what CRC polynomial you
are using.

The second problem involves publishing the CRC so that others may know
if distributed code had been changed.  For this, you must also publish
the polynomial so that others can check the code.  Clearly here the
polynomial is known and the virus writer can take that into account as
he writes his mean stuff.

Since in the first case speed is of the essence (I run my checker with
each bootup and it takes time), and in the second case, it is less so,
we have two problems with two solution sets.

If we were living in the 1930's, this statement might have some validity.
Today, it is extremely naive.  The world is full of failed cryptosystems
which people relied on because "no one could demonstrate a method" of breaking
them.  Given advances in the field, the burden of proof should be - and, among
people who work on these issues, IS - entirely on the PROPOSER of a system to
show that his system is secure, in some sense.  (Absolute proofs of security
are still beyond us, but proofs if certain problems which are believed to be
very hard are, indeed, very hard are possible.)

I suggest you read Kahn's "The Codebreakers" and see if you wish to stand by
your statement.

        Since I may have misunderstood something and this might be a more
        important point than I thought, it should be mentioned that a CRC
        checker (the same program which I mentioned in my message yesterday)
        has been written which makes a random choice among almost 70 million
        irreducible polynomials.  Do you think anyone can forge a checksum on
        that basis?

Yes, easily.  A common error in this kind of work is not to understand the
power of brute force.  Your range of possible polynomials is too small to be
secure.  Suppose I know how your polynomial generator works, and have a copy
of ONE file with your checksum for it.  I proceed to compute the checksum of
the file with all 70 million possible polynomials, comparing the results to
the known checksum.  Even if it takes a second to compute, I can expect a
match in a little over a year.  If I'm serious about the search and willing to
make an investment in hardware, I can get a result much faster, since the
program parallelizes trivially to arbitrary degree.

If I get to chose the file - if, for example, you maintain a BBS and I can
convince you to add my file to your files and publish a checksum for it for
people to check - I may be able to do better.  (At a minimum, I can guarantee
that the file is short and so can be checked quickly.)

What I get out is the actual polynomial - more than I needed.  (There's a
chance - about 1 in a 100 - that two polynomials produce the same checksum on
the given file.  A quick check with another file - if you publish one, you'll
publish another - minimizes this.)

Go to 48-bit polynomials, and this method becomes impractical.  But you don't
KNOW that other methods don't make the problem absolutely trivial!

                     This program is based essentially on Prof. Michael
        Rabin's "fingerprint" algorithm, and as you yourself admitted in your
        contribution of May 9, that makes it cryptographically strong despite
        the fact that it is CRC-based.

I no longer have a copy of my May 9th contribution - I'm fascinated, and
complimented, that anyone thought it interesting enough to save and remember -
but the use of "admitted" in this context is suspect.  It has nothing to do
with proof.  Rabin's scheme was based on an idea that is common in much of his
work, and actually goes back to basic game theory:  Using randomization,
choose one path from among many.  Your adversary can defeat any particular
path you choose, but because he doesn't know which one you will choose, he
must defeat all of them at once - which he cannot do.  Here, "path" is a
particular polynomial.  Rabin's scheme fails immediately if your opponent
knows the particular polynomial you intend to use.

As I recall, I speculated that you could get around this by publishing a list
of polynomials, and checksums with respect to ALL of them, with the list so
long that the adversary could not compute a falsified value that would satisfy
all of them but still have an acceptable length.  Then you would check a
small, randomly chosen subset of the polynomials.

For this to work, a suitable list of polynomials would have to be shown to
exist:  Long enough that fooling all, or even a signficant fraction, of them
simultaneously is impossible; short enough that you would be willing to
compute and publish ALL the checksums.  I don't know of anyone who has shown
that such a list can be constructed; it's an interesting problem.

There is an interesting program called PC-LOCK which will effectively
isolate your hard disk (at least on an XT) from the system.  Once
installed, if a user attempts a hard disk boot, he/she must supply the
proper password to gain access to the HD.  If booted by a floppy in
the A drive, access is also blocked as the HD does not appear to
exist, and the user does not have access.  This package is shareware.
I would be happy to make it available to all in the conference, but I
am not sure how to do so.

Apologies to all for extending this debate any further; I merely desire
to explain that my primary concern is not that Loren would embezzle
funds.  I am actually concerned that the conference might not happen.
In that case, I will be out $50 for two months or so.  This is signifi-
cant to me, as I am a college student with not a lot of dough.  Fifty
bucks will buy me 1.5 textbooks on the average.  Putting a conference
together, with finding a location, hotel accomodations, arranging for
printing and typesetting documents, reviewing papers for presentation,
and a zillion other details is a HUGE amount of work.  One person
working alone and having no experience arranging conferences is likely
to find it very difficult.  And the semester is about to begin.

With that, I drop the subject.

This is quite true.  However, the checksums and the keys to generate them
can be much smaller than the code being protected.

Imagine a service of the following form:  You pay some amount of money to join
up.  You are given a sealed box containing a checksummer:  It accepts a file
as a series of bytes on an ASCII line and displays a checksum.  The device is
built so as to be very hard to reverse-engineer.

Anyone producing a piece of software provides a copy to the service.  The
service will NOT accept it until it has a verifiable identification of the
person.  The service then computes the checksum and saves it away for later.

When you want to use a piece of registered code, you pick it up from any
convenient source, call the registry, ask for the checksum, and compare to
what your checksum box claims the checksum should be.  Alternatively, the
service prints the checksum on some hard-to-forge medium and sends copies to
subscribers.  (The technology for making hard-to-forge paper and such is long
established.)

This scheme requires that the checksum function be cryptographically strong:
Every subscriber is in a position to calculate the checksum of any piece of
text he wishes to.  You need to be reasonably confident that this will not
help him forge checksums.

In connection with the issue of just how hard it is, in general, to
break encoding schemes, and the power of brute force in the form of computers,
readers of this list should read the Science Times section of the
New York Times for Tuesday, Aug 30th: here, the mathematician John
Conway of Princeton (and creator of the game of LIFE) offered a

number in a series.  Colin Mallows of AT&T Bell Labs came up with
the solution, in part using a computer, in an astonishingly
short time.  Conway had offered a 10,000.00 reward, which Mallows
agreed was a slip of the tongue, or at least the exponent.
Mallows kept and framed the check for ten grand, and accepted
an alternative reward of 1.0E3 for his grandchildren.

with the loss of SuperPaint and Word icons.  Opening ResEdit again, I found the
 file blank.  Any guesses?

     If I'm not mistaken, there are several versions of Pc-Lock.
Version 1.0 is suppose to have some bugs in it that sometimes changes
your partition table, thereby nuking most/all of your files.  Version 1.1
corrects this problem.  Version 3.0 (which is NOT shareware) allows you
to have up to 5 passwords (1 administrator and 4 user).  Based on which
password you enter, you can have your AUTOEXEC.BAT branch to different
routines.

We have installed it on 31 IBM-PCs w/20M hd, EGA, 640K... and have had
(almost) no problems.  On 2 machines, we are unable to install it (I
think that its a h-disk problem, not related to Pc-Lock).  Only the tech
people (with a user password 4 set just for them) and the lab supervisor
in charge of updating software have access to the hard-drive itself.
Since Pc-Lock will allow you to permantly "turn off" CNTL-BRK, your
favorite menu program will see to it that students can not run files
from drive A or B, thereby reducing the chance that the computer will
pick up a nasty bug.

        As the "virus expert" (ha ha) I have been asked to establish
Univ. standards for virus Protection-Detection.  Would anyone
who has set policies, procedures, etc. please share them?  Most
importantly, I need to evaluate & purchase Anti-Viral software,
any recommendations or experiences on this subject would be greatly
appreciated.
Thanks in advance.  I will post a synopsis of your mail and my findings.

Dave,

On your letter asking about virus protection/detection/prevention -- what
machines (i.e. IBMs Macs) are you looking at?  Also, what kind of money are
you planning on spending?  As they say, the best is going to cost you big
money.

Hi gang,
I just read Ross's warning about flutxt4.com .
Somehow he sounds very scared, is it because Flushot 3+ (whatever version)
isn't good enough to cope with the beast ??

That Flushot4 warning is half a year old.  In the meantime, Ross
Greenberg has released FluShot Plus (The "Plus" is used so that people
would not continue to use the corrupted FluShot that was spreading
around) versions 1.0, 1.2, 1.4 (1.3 does not exists; Ross is
superstitous).   I think that before you start rehashing FluShot as you
are doing right now, you should look at FluShot Plus 1.4.  The only
errors that I have heard about or encountered are with the CMOS memory
reads while reading certain floppy disks, and the fact that certain
editors (BRIEF?!?) can edit protected files without any type of TSR
warning.

PC WEEK reports two organizations providing information on combatting
the spread of virus software. They are:

          Software Development Council, Box-61031, Palo Alto, CA 94306
          (415) 854-7219

          Computer Virus Industry Association, 4423 Cheeny St, Santa Clara,
          CA
          (408) 988-3832
Does anyone know, what these organizations provide ?

I believe there is a general principle in insurance that, except where
otherwiseprovided (such as a prizefighters hands being damaged in a bar
fight..)  the insurance company will refuse to pay if someone else can
be held at fault (i.e.  sued.)  This came up here in Calgary lately with
regard to some flooding which was aggravated by cowboy bus_drivers
causing tidal waves through the affected communities...insurance refused
to pay for the damage since it wasn't a "natural event."

Sorry about that. CACM stands for: Communications of the Assocation
for Computing Machinery. The association's name belies its function;
it's actually an association for PEOPLE who use computing machinery.
(I never could figure out how someone could arrive at a name like that.)
