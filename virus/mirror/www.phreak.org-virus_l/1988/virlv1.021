Subject: local tv broadcast

          Last Tuesday (Nov.  22, 1988), Loren Keim was interviewed by a
local (Bethlehem, PA) television station regarding the  release of his
anti-virus packages.  As someone fairly familiar  with the workings of
some  of the  more  popular   packages, I was   wondering if you would
enlighten us as  to what, exactly,   makes yours any   better than the
rest, Loren?

          I was particularly interested in the mention of the fact that,
by  some  type  of  key   encryption, you  expect  each  package to be
'different'.  More specifically, I believe you made  mention that if a
virus was able to penetrate  the defenses offered  by your package, it
would  most probably be   because of the  encryption  key used by that
particular user.  You went on to say that this would not mean that the
same virus would be able to  get by the  same program if it  were used
with a different key.  Now forgive my possible ignorance, but it seems
to me that if a  virus could  bypass an encryption  algorithm, the key
used  wouldn't matter.  It's  possible  that I misunderstood  what was
said, it's even possible that what you (Loren)  said  is possible, but
if it is, then I'm in need of some serious enlightenment.

          Additionally, (and   finally...    :-) you made   mention   of
anti-virus  packages you  plan on  releasing for the larger  machines.
I've done  quite a  bit  of work  on  security on  UN*X  machines, and
without seriously restricting user  privileges, I can't really seem to
come up with any real practical ways of securing a system beyond those
which the system already uses.  As far as I've been able to  tell, you
would  have two  choices  available  to you when   setting up security
separate from that provided by the  system.  Either you would  have to
set the particular security program readable  to all (which sets us up
for problems) or give  a user's login  process momentary higher access
(which  set us up  for disaster...)  Again,  I may be mistaken, and if
so, enlightenment would be appreciated.

          Anyone  else have any  ideas?  Anyone  else see the broadcast?
Anyone else know what I'm talking about?

Hello there!

The following remarks pertain only to the Federal Republic of Germany
(not to the German Democratic Reepublic) and are given under the proviso
that I'm no lawyer and hence may well overlook or misunderstand some
regulation.

> Is it true that under German law, an offense takes place only if files
> are erased?

No, this isn't true.  According to +303a of German Criminal Code, he who
illegally CHANGES data (not necessarily in files, but on machine-readable
media, e.g. a boot sector, a FAT, ...) can be punished with 2 years
emprisonment.  According to +303b,  the same fact (and also physical
damage done to computer media or equipment) can by punished with up to
5 years, if the inflicted data-processing is essential for a company or
authority, other than the one the perpetrator is employed in.

These regulation enhance or qualify the usual +303 (damage to property).

> That it is not a violation to simply enter a computer and read infor-
> mation?

Though this situation is not covered by the above-mentioned rules, there
are many regulations in German law to handel particular cases falling
into this broad category.  However, most of these regulations to not
apply specifically to computer-stored or -handeled data; normally they
apply to specific nature of the data, regardless wether they are stored
on magnetic media, written down on paper, or whispered into your ear.

Commercial secrets are protected by law against unfair competition.
These may neither be disclosed unauthorized, nor read by intrudors.
Also, trade-marks are protected: you may not e.g. use the Microsoft
Logo for your own programs, and you may even run into trouble, if you
imitate their menu-technique too closely.  In such cases, it doesn't
matter, whether you actally copied the programs (menu) or data (logo)
from their computer, or developped them yourself.  Cf. also patenting
law.

Artistic, scientific, and technical presentations are protected by
copyright law.  As opposed to US regulations, there's no need to state
the copyright explicitly in the publication itself, nor to register the
opus somewhere.  You only need to produce something sufficently new.
The law enforces that the original author be mentioned in copies,
citations, performances, and adaptions.  The law generally forbids
unouthorized copies and performances (there are exceptions).  Some
lawyers argue, that even the loading of a program or data from secondary
to primary storage (in due course of running, or displaying it, respec-
tively) constitutes an unauthorized copy.  I think, this is ridiculous,
but you never know the outcome of a law suit, beforehand!  However, I
reckon, the running of a program (e.g. a computer-game) may constitute
an unouthorized performance (similar to a video, a movie, or a piece
of music).

A broad class of protected data are "Data Related to (natural) Persons".
Many of those are protected by special regulations (e.g. professional
descretion of doctors, lawyers, or confessors; privacy of mail and other
communication).  If you break into a computer of a hospital and read
patient's data, you will prosecuted according to the pertinent regula-
tions of criminal and/or social law;  if you illegally read data (as
notes addressed to 3rd parties, or traffic-related data) from a Federal
Post-Office and Telecommunication Authorities' computer, you will be
prosecuted under "break of the tele-communication secret".

Data Related to Persons that do not qualify for special rules (as above)
are protected by the "Laws to Prevent Mis-Use of Person Related Data
during Data-Processing".  There are several such laws, pertaining to
data-processing for private purposes (including companies) and by
various authorities (remarkably, the only area apparently not covered
by any such law is data-processing by churches and religious communities
for their own purposes).  The maxim of these laws seems to be, that
processing of person-related data is generally forbidden, if not allowed
by some specific law, by consent of the person reffered to, or if the
data are evident (Beware: your name and address may well be evident, but
if they are to be put on some particular list it is not+all evident
that you should belong to this very list -- hence putting evident data
on particular lists or into files falls under these laws).  According to
+41(1)2  of the Federal Law to Prevent ..., and similar Paragraphs in
the other laws mentioned, "he, who ... recalls person-related data, that
are not evident, or takes them from a collection that is enclosed in a
container, will be punished with imprisoning up to one year, or with a
fine".

You see, in German Law it doesn't matter whether you break into a com-
puter, or brake privacy in other respects:  the regulations pertain to
the nature of the data not to the medium of recording.

> I have heard these rumors, but I do not know if they are true.

Please excuse any contribution from my side to mis-conseption in these
issues.  As I have posted remarks to VIRUS-L which may have raised
these rumours, I send a copy of this note also there.

Best regards
             Otto

Subject: Software on the LISTSERV (PC)

I just got some additional software for the LISTSERV file list (thanks
to David Bader) which is now available to all.  The new files are:

FSP_14 UUE         FluShot + version 1.4
CHKUP18 UUE        Checkup version 1.8
TRAPDISK UUE       Trapdisk version ???
DPROT102 UUE       Disk Protect (?) version 1.02

As with all the files on our LISTSERV, these are free for the taking.
As such, they're on an as-is basis.

Ken

P.S. One of the local BITNET links has been unavailable for most of
the U.S. Thanksgiving weekend, so if you don't see your submission(s)
in this digest, they'll undoubtedly be coming along shortly since the
floodgate has just been opened...  :-(

Subject: internet beating

          In light  of the  recent slew of  kill him/thank  him messages
regarding the internet virus/worm/whatever, I would like to express my
opinions via the following quote taken from a Monty  Python skit.  The
quote   is taken  entirely  out  of   context,  and  has no  relevence
whatsoever (is that  really a  word?) but it will suffice   to get  my
point across...


          "Oh Lord, we beseach thee.  Prey tell us who croaked the
           Bishop of Lestor..."

          "He did it, the one in the red sweater."

          "Right, arrest that man.."

          "It's a fair cop, but society's to blame."

          "Fine, we'll arrest them too."


          Now,  did I say  irrelevent or what?  But   if you replace the
Bishop of Lestor  with   the word Internet,  and  the one  in the  red
sweater with our  Internet whacker,  we have an interesting  parallel.
True there was  a  large waste of  manpower...  True there was a large
amount of downtime...  But now that it's over let it  be over.   Think
of the extra  time being wasted  deciding whether or  not he should be
knighted or damned  for all eternity.  After   three weeks of  virus-l
being monopolized by  this  sort of thing, it  would be nice  to start
seeing  more about  what's  going on.   If  anyone  has any *NEW* info
regarding what happened, I'd love to hear it, but reducing the list to
a browbeating session really isn't my idea of a good time.  But that's
only my opinion...

Subject: How good is Virex? (Mac virus remover)

Does anyone have experience yet with a program called "Virex" from HJC
software?

According to MacWEEK, it's supposed to remove nVIR, SCORES and Peace
viruses.  They don't say if this includes system files.  It's
described in their blurb as the "great grandchild" of Interferon and
sells for $99.95.

Responses to PRUSSELL@OBERLIN or to the list.  Thanks.

Hello,

     I am interested in doing a brief paper (5 pages) on the history
of computer viruses.  If you know of any books or articles that
address the origin and pioneers of computer viruses I would very much
like to know of them.  Thank You.

                                                Regards,

                                                    John Planck

Subject:  Passing Viruses

We at UNM have been dealing with what appears to be
a mutated or modified version of nVir.  As a result I have
had multiple requests for a 'copy' of the strain.  All of
which I have filed for future action.  In discussions with
my administration, it has been decided to NOT mail any
virus to anyone until- the local FBI office gives us an OK,
that the requestee has been confirmed as a legitimate researcher
for the firm s/he claims to be, and I get the time to send registered
mail to these individuals.
Question- what do others of you do with similar requests?
