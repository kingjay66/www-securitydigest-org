Subject: Hi and Questions (request for virus info)

Hello Everybody!

   With the VAST and GREAT knowledge out there... (I know you're
thinking "Now what does this guy want?" so I'll save the praise and
glory.)

    I am looking for information on viruses (What else?).  In
particular, known origins (IE/ What was the first virus?), popular
methods of attack, names of people who are experts in the field, books
on the subject, respected articles, etc.

    Any help you lend will be greatly appreciated.

    (I am looking through the archives of this list at present and
     have been querying various listservers but this is getting on my
     nerves!)

Thanks in advance.

FLUSHOT4 was a hacked version of FLUSHOT3 and a trojan horse.  Ross
Greenberg, the author of the FluShot series, then switched names to
FluShot Plus (FSP+) to avoid confusion from the old, corrupt versions.
Also, Ross has released versions 1.1 1.2 and 1.4 of FSP+ (he skipped
version 1.3 out of superstition :-) ).  I would suggest that you do
not use any other version than the most current release (version 1.4),
since there are numerous bugs in the previous releases.

Subject: general virus query

I am very curious about this VIRUS DISCUSSION LIST... I was wondering
how do I know if the virus entered into my computer program. Is there
a way to explain how to find how it show up on the computer?  I really
don't understand much about the virus.  Can you send some information
about the virus that can cause the computer crashed or etc? I would
like to read that information.  You may send the information to my
computer at this station :

in%"11dlarsen@Gallua.bitnet"

                                                THANK YOU.....
