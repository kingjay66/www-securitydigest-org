    Hi Networkers...!

              We are agree  to tell you that,  in our University,
    it has been  developed a program which take out  the JV virus
    from the  .COM files. The  author is Gonzalo Rojas  Costa, an
    electric engineering student which works with us in the virus
    investigation.

              This program ( called  VACUNAJV.COM ) was originaly
    developed in assembly language, and  the release 1.0 has been
    tested with success cleaning a lot of spreaded programs.

              Actualy, the  program is  available for  the BITNET
    users, and you just have to  write us. But first, we need the
    UUENCODE and UUDECODE programs for the sending.

              Besides,  we  are begining  to  work  in a  similar
    program that cleans the .EXE files.

              Our purpose, as work group, is to develope efective
    tools  for the  file spreading,  making protection  rules and
    studing the  efective damage produced  by the virus,  and how
    they are produced.

              We know that in the world exist many groups working
    on the  same area, an we  would like to contact  them for the
    information interchange. Lately, we  have had some cases with
    the BRAIN virus, and we NEED all the information available.



              Hoping your response,

                Universidad de Santiago de Chile.

    Note: We are talking of a PC IBM or compatibles.

Looking for any and all info on anti-viral software, hardware
(including plug in cards), and OS stuff.  Please help - am having
trouble locating useful info.  (Rest of message follows below...)

Hello!
I was hoping you could help me track down some people doing research
on secure (meaning virus proof) pc architectures.  I'm looking for
some profs or grad students who are designing virus resistant pc
architectures...  it's for a project I'm doing for my senior project
in high performance architecture class CS448 up here...  Any help
would be appreciated!

Bill

Hi, thanks to all who sent debrain.exe in 'coded' form.  I requested
uuencode pas and uudecode pas from LEHIIBM1 but they will not compile
properly (read error free) under Turbo 4.0.

Perhaps someone can take the time to explain to all newcomers how this
procedure works so we can get DEBRAIN.EXE in an executable format.

[Ed. I'll try to put up Turbo Pascal 4.0 versions of uuencode and
uudecode on our LISTSERV before the end of this week.]

     I believe I've read somewhere that viruses can cause hardware
problems, like drives to fail.  Does anyone know what the specific
problem with the drives could be if a virus would do this(cause one to
fail.)?

With all due respect, has anyone considered that the recent virus
might have been a test conceived by the father and son working as a
team?

After all his father is the Director of Computer Security at the Fort
Meade computer center and could authorize such a test!  [Ed. I don't
think that title is correct; I believe that Robert Morris, Sr. is a
research scientist for the NCSC, if memory serves me correctly.]

I think this could have been done to emphasize the need for more
thorough testing and control of government appropriated software.

In any event, no real damage was done, no files destroyed, just a
massive computer networl brought to it's knees. Imagine if the same
thing happened when SAC reported 100+ missles inbound!
