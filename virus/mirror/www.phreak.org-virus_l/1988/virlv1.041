I am also extremely interested in Mac viruses, and related material.
I don't wish to bore anyone by my ignorance but any comments would be
greatly appreciated. I've just been through a harrowing experience of
coming in each morning and finding that my system has been trashed!
The problem was not isolated, the dealer came in and gave me a
replacement.  So until someone enlightens me, Iiruses

You can obtain a HyperCard stack informing you about the known Mac
viruses, programs to get rid of them and keep them out, and general
hints on avoiding viruses by sending mail to LISTSERV at SCFVM on BITNet.
The text of the message should be GET ANTI-VIR SITHQX. Listserv will
send you a copy of the file. It is in BinHex4 format, and will have to
be decoded by BinHex4 or by StuffIt. If you're a novice Mac user, please
drop me a private note and I will help you with getting the file and
converting it back into a usable form.

Subject:      Mac Virus Documentation from Apple

I just got a call yesterday from someone at Apple in California (I'm
sorry, but I didn't get his name) who tells me that Apple is pge. I don't know how long it will
be before it is out, but I would guess that they will let me know when
it is going to be.  I would suppose they'll provide it via AppleLink.

So, if you've had trouble getting my stack, you may be able to get it
from your Apple dealer soon!

** OVERFLOW ** OVERFLOW ** OVERFLOW ** OVERFLOW ** OVERFLOW ** TILT **
I'm facing a dilemma that may be troubling other readers of this llist
as well:  the list contents is getting just too voluminous (not to say
repetitious at times) and I just don't have time to wade through it all
every day any more.  That by itself is of no interest to anyone else,
although it may be a problem some others are having as well.

Where the problem lies is that I'm relying on the list for early warning
of imminent trouble (a role it served ao unsubscribe for reasons of safety.

Which brings to mind an interesting question:  Is there another list that
serves as a virus alert hot-line?  If not, should there be one?  No
exchange of opinions, no flames, no meeting announcements, just facts
dealing with situations that require IMMEDIATE acton.

[Ed. I don't know of any such list, but it may not be a bad idea.]

JANET based readers of this list might like to know thaf the
report is there. If you haven't used the info-server software before
send an empty mail message to "info-server@uk.ac.ukc" and find out how
to order a copy

Subject:  Dos 2 vs Dos 3, etc (PC)

If you format a hard disk under dos3.x, and its big enough, it gets
formatted with 16-bit fat entries; dos2.x only formats with 12-bit fat
entries; thus, a hard drive formatted under dos3.x can'trable because there is no way to prevent a
program from doing anything.  Some things are not easy and/or possible
under DOS, but you can program anything.  Since everyone who cares to
read a manual can find out where all the important things are stored
in RAM, you can goof up anything.  Thus protection on PC's runs to
things like not letting you do disk writes and checking programs to see
if they have become longer or have had come check property (like CRC)
altered.  Not the greatest protection!

I don't think Fred Cohen has a bitnet address.  Last I heard he wanted
an account on Lehigh's computers, but wasn't given one because he isn't
on the faculty here any more.

Does anybody know how I could get hold of a paper titled how he
actually imagined viruses.
