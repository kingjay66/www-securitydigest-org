Subject:      PERFECT VIRUS

Just a hunch I had about that note threatening the advent of
the PERFECT virus: might this be about a virus targetting
the new WordPerfect 5.0?  It seems to me that WP 5.0 is going
to be spread around quickly and widely, furnishing a powerful
vehicle for a virus. Sound plausible?

In-Reply-To:  Message of 31 Jul 88 23:10 EDT from "Robert Newberry"


Robert Newberry  asks:

   1.  If it is actually legal to start spreading computer diseases.

   2.  Court decisons on computer disease related cases.  Can a victim
       sue the creator of a virus for loss of important data.

In general under common law, that which is not explicitly forbidden is
implicilty permitted.  Even lying is permitted up to a point.  One limit
is lying in an attempt to defraud.  However, except when it is
explicitly restricted in such a way, there is no generic law that could
be expected to cover all viruses.

I am not aware of any applicable litigation.

One should assume that he can be sued for anything.  However, the burden
of proof is usually on the one bringing suit.  He must be able to prove
that he was damaged, by the act of another, and that that act was
deliberate or, at least, negligent.  The proof must be "by a
preponderance of the evidence."  Proving any of these things by such a
test is always difficult.  In the case of a virus, it would be very
difficult at best.

Of interest is that this article was published by 2600, "The Hacker

hackers are beginning to recognize that they, perhaps more than others,
have an interest in honest labelling of programs?

        Tactics...

        A relatively effective software strategy for an anti-viral program
        might be to use the timer interrupt. It is done by installing a TSR
        which implements two functions:

        1- When loaded, it intercepts the timer interrupt vector. It
           then times its own execution and stores this duration with
           a checksum. This prevents its interrupt from being preempted
           by using timing dependencies.
        2- At 18 times per second, it compares interrupt vectors for
           modifications, these are flagged and, if restricted, they are
           disabled.

        The resolution is somewhat coarse considering the number of
        machine instructions that can execute between intervals, but it
        can effectively arrest the destruction of data.

Robert, I've been looking for laws concerning viruses for
some time, and havn't found any.  I have located three laws
which I will summarize when I have them in front of me.
They basically state that it is illegal to enter a computer
system that is not their own or that they don't rightly
have access to because its a form of breaking an enterring
...  fi their computer enters it, they are responsible, or
if some program they wrote enters it, they are responsible.
It is also illegal to read other people 's mail on the
system, even if it is your own companies system.   And
its illegal to change anything on a system which you were
not specidfically asked to change by the user, fi I remember
correctly.

As for a Wrod Perfect virus.  I hadn't considered the implications
of the word PERFECT (no pun intended).  As I remember, some school
had writtena  letter to this listserv back in Frebrauary (please
excuse my typing ... my terminal will not backspace with this machine),
about a word perfect virus (Miami?).   They were complaining about
it being a varient for m of the brain which would attack the
program Word Perfect if memory serves.  I'll have to look back through
my files for it.

Also, 250,000 outbreaks is a bit high.  If therey are counting number
of disks infected, that might be  a little low.   We had around 600 disk
infected at Lehigh alone with the first outbreak of a virus here.
Figures of the Israeli virus put it at around 18000 copies found (althou
that number counldn't be backed up by anytone.)

Kent,

The idea you present makes the microcomputer unusable unless it
has multiple motherchips.   (Actually, a TSR chip can be added
which works like any chip run on interrupts).  You cannot implement
you idea in software.

A few days ago, I mentioned the possibility of having a conference
for the group of us at some time in the future.  We have had about
forty people say they were interested in such a thing from several
areas of the country.

We have a few people who wish to discuss various security topics
and so on.

I believe that if we set a date and place for such a conference,
we will get quite a few more responses.

I have some comments on the idea:

1)  I would like to open it to the press.  We could bill it as a
    big meeting of the minds on virus-theory and how we might
    be able to stop these destructive programs.
2)  I would be happy to set it up, would anyone else like to
    volunteer to help?
3)  I'd like some ideas on how long such a conference would last
    ... the problem is that some people may end up coming from
    great distances for it.
4)  I prefer to hold such a meeting in the Lehigh Valley area
    (Allentown/Bethlehem  Pa) which is less than an hour from
    Philadelphia, less than 2 hours from New York City, 5 hours
    from Boston, and 5 from Washington DC.  Its a centralized
    location with quite a bit of access.   If there are any
    great reservations about this area, we can consider something
    else.   We may be able to get a group together on the East
    Coast and one together a bit later on the West Coast.  If we
    do this, I'd like to attend both, and I wouldn't mind
    organizing both.
5)  Since we did have some enthusiastic replies to the idea,
    I believe we can get a decent group together to work on the
    theories of computer viruses, protection schemes, future
    computer security and so on.

    Comments?

Alright, to answer further questions about a virus seminar:

1) Will it cost money?

   I don't know yet, we're just considering it.  I imagine that
if we want to make up a booklet for the meeting, we might ask
for a donation, or perhaps some of the colleges and companies
out there might donate a small amount of money with the promise
of us putting an add for them in the package.  We may also need
to rent some conference rooms, although I think I can get some.
And if the group is small (although I doubt it will be) we
might hold a dinner of some sort.

2)  When will it be?

    Again, we're just discussing the idea.   Unfortunately,
for college professors and associates, school is starting
shortly and I doubt we'll get something in before it starts,
but I don't think we'll have a problem if its early in the
semester.  What would you think of the second weekend in
September?   Earlier, later?

3)  How far is the Lehigh Valley from Trenton, Princeton,
and Pittsburg.

    Ugh!  Its on the map.  The Allentown area is about an
hour and a quarter from Trenton if memory serves, I have't
been there since the Trenton Computer Faire.  I have't
the slightest idea how far it is from Trenton, I haven't
been there in a while.  But for the New Jersey people,
its an hour from Morristown, 3 hours from Atlantic City
(max, some people make it in less), and an hour and a
quarter to a half from Camden.  You can figure out
the rest.

     Its about 4 1/2 - 6 hours from Pittsburg.  I've gotten
all sorts of conflicting times on that.  It takes me 4 1/2 hours,
you slow drivers may take a bit longer.  Its an hour and a half
from Harrisburg, an hour and a half from Lancaster.

     People who are farther than Pittsburg may want to fly.
I think its a 15 minute hop from Chicago for only 35 bucks.

     And no, Karen, we are not a "hick town".  The Valley
has 700,000 people in it.  Granted, we're not New York City,
but we hold our own in terms of metropolitan areas.  Incidently,
we have 3 sky scrapers (wow!).   We're also home to AT&T
research (Bell Labs and several other AT&T plants), Air
Products, Bethlehem Steel, Mack Trucks and Union Pacific.
Its a very nice area to live.

No casual test of the date of creation, or even the file size will
trap the inclusion of a virus into command.com.  The 4000 byte space
left at the end of that program allows for room to enter a sizable
virus.  Even my favorite scheme of checking the CRC can easily be
defeated if the virus writer knows what CRC formula I use by the
simple addition of 2 bytes of non-executable code to fix the CRC and
return it to its original value.

Even if there were not room for a sizable virus, the scheme (already
used) of putting a program onto disk and marking that disk area as bad
in the FAT, and then linking that area into your code can would afford
all of the space needed.

Watching command.com and other files that matter with a CRC formula
that is different from that others use is one of the best ways I know
to detect infection (albeit after it happens).

The people from the East Coast agree that it should be here.

The people from the middle states tell us that we should have
a nationally centralized location.

Eep.  I didn't mean to start a war.  I'd like people who

You won't catch my virus by watching for DOS calls, because I won't use
them.
You won't catch my virus by watching for BIOS calls, because I won't
use them.
Since every one knows where DOS and BIOS keep the information about
your hard disk and everyone knows what port addresses do what on a PC
compatible, I'll just access the hardware directly.  It may be more
trouble, but its also a sure-fire way to eat your FAT tables and/or
insert myself into any program I wish.
  Face it - the IBM 'open architecture' was a great idea for clone
manufacturers; but now everyone uses the same BIOS data areas and the
same port addresses in the interests of compatibility, so there is no
mystery about how to get your hands on the hardware.
  Command.com is a great place to hide a virus, not only because it has
room for it, but also because it gets executed immediately after your
autoexec, so your chances of catching the virus depend upon what you do
in autoexec.  Also, everyone has command.com and everyone uses it all
the time, so it has lots of chances of spreading an infection.
  The AIDS slogan is safe sex or no sex.  Apply the same or greater
caution to your computer!

In some ways, a program like VIRSIM is a good idea *IF* it is
well written and *IF* it is updated frequently to reflect the
leading edge of virology. At least it would provide a benchmark
against which we could measure the masses of anti-viral software
that have been appearing lately. If one can incorporate all known
threats in the test, then at least we will know what protection
we are buying (or not buying) with a package. Since a recycled
known virus can cause as much grief as new one if it finds a
loophole in your defenses.

The risks are as follows:
-   new methods of attack will be developed to circumvent current
    defense mechanisms - as has been stated previously, a
    simulator will give a false sense of security
-   a well documented simulator will unfortunately provide a
    source of viral techniques for the bad guys.

The only way to do a better job of anti-virus work is to actively
research it - but then the fellow who taught VIRUS-101 caught a
lot of flack didn't he, so it would be a fairly dicey process to
say the least...

Can someone send me the address of NBBS or Interpath - tnx.

Subject:      Forwarded legal comments from J.D. Abolins


I received this file which was sent to VIRUS-L from OJA@NCCIBM1 :
[Note J.D. - you can't send files to the list, only mail. Ken]

The three legal points are pretty the basic tools for dealing with
computer crime. Here's the listing of the legal action from what I
have seen--

1) Breaking and Entering variants, including illegal systems access
2) Fraud. This is evident for computer acts which produce a financial
   benefit to the perpretrator. (This has not been seen in any viruses
   to date.) In the case of the British Telecomm hackers, a fraud law
   was used to bring the fellows to trial for hacking into Prince Charles's
   e-mail.
3) Sabotage and it's variants. (If the malicious program was shown to
   be delieberately used against am installation.)
4) Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) regarding e-mail
   privacy. (I'll send up a rought text and analysis soon.)
5) The various state laws regarding computers.

Computer law is in its infancy. Most attempts to prosecute are based upon
existing laws.

>Also, 250,000 outbreaks is a bit high.  If therey are counting number
>of disks infected, that might be  a little low.   We had around 600 disk

>Figures of the Israeli virus put it at around 18000 copies found (althou
>that number counldn't be backed up by anytone.)

About the counts, it does depend upon what was counted- installations,
computers, disks, potentially affected disks, people affected by the affected
disks, etc. Also, about the counts of the typeso f viruses, there is a major
problem- lack of nomeclature (naming) conventions. This is compunded by the
rapid stream of virus reports. Many times, the reports may change the name of
case and future article writers get the impression that it is a new case.
This happened with the Hebrew University case; it has been called "Hebrew
University virus", "Israeli virus", "PLO virus", "Friday the 13th virus",
etc. From writing articles about viruses and other things, I have seen
how easy it easy for jumbling of facts, especially if only secondary and
tertiary sources are used.

Finally, the fact that the viruses are codes that are embedded in files
complicate identification. (This makes the "Dirty Dozen listing" approach
more difficult. Rather than giving a common file name of the malicious
program (which is helpful for trojan horses, until someone changes the
filename), the viruses need to be described by mode of transmission,
attack, symptoms, etc.

Subject:      Virus/Computer Security Conference results


Wow!

We've have quite a few comments, questions and preferences come in
today.  I'll give you a quick run down and try to answer some of the
overlapping questions.

We've had 18 votes for the East Coast, 2 votes for the middle states, 3
people who said they didn't care because they'd have to fly over the
ocean to get here anyway and NO votes for the West Coast (surprize!).

I would like you to keep sending me mail and suggestions, we'll see how
the majority of people feel, but we'll need to know quickly if we want
to set this up.

Most people believe we should have a weekend-long conference, rather
than a day because some are willing to fly in for it and because we
have so many people interested in the subject.  I agree.

I'd like to thank Craig Pepmiller for his suggestions, and his "sample
weekend" which outlays a set of possible conferences.  I also that all
the people who had suggestions for specific people to speak.  The names
to come up the most were:  Several people for Y. Radai, several people
for Fred Cohen, several people for me (honest, I didn't say a thing!),
and one person who asked for a member of Panda systems to speak.  As
well we had two people ask if we could get Robert Slade to bring his
material on viruses down, 3 people who wanted to know where they could
get copies of Fred Cohen's booklets (I have some material, but not
all), and if they could get copies of my book (It ISN'T published yet!)
We had questions about hotel accomodations and expenses.  I think we
will have to end up charging something so we can have food at the
conference, coffee, donuts, and so on.  It will be a non-profit
conference however.  Also, for overnight guests, we'll need hotel
accomodations.  If any companies are interested in donations???

We were asked whether or not this would be an "official" conference, so
it could be university sponsored by different universities.   Yes, I
don't see a problem with that.  I also see no problem with sending
personal invitations to help get colleges to pay for certain people's
trips to the conference.

Craig also suggested that for people who cannot get to the conference,
have it video taped.  I like that idea.   If anyone has suggestions
for topics, please send them.

As well, several people suggested that we have the speeches published
and sent out to whoever wants them and can't make it.  I see no problem
with that, but we'll probably have to charge a small fee for it.

I was incorrect on my time from Chicago to ABE airport.   It is not 15
minutes, it is more like an hour.  Prices are still in question
however, I will check them.

Prof. Larky also points out that ABE is serviced by United, USAir,
Northwest, Eastern and several regional airports.

For people who asked whether the Lehigh Valley has any computer
significance... BITE YOUR TONGUE!  Charles Brown (anyone remember
him) was out here a while back to give a speech.  He told us
that the Lehigh Valley was the original, the one and ONLY silicon
valley.  The Valley, he said, is where the computer was conceived
and where the microchip was first invented.   We also have
Bell Labs here, AT&T solid state labs, AT&T, Bell Atlantic, a
small IBM outpost, Unisys, Digital servicing, Lehigh University,
Homer Research Labs, and quite a few other little places.  (We
don't have HP or Epson out here, and that has always depressed
me.)

That is all for now, I'll have more as it developes.   Keep the
comments coming in, and I will set up a definitive date, a definite
place and schedule it.  Again, we had one volunteer to work on the
conference and three others that hinted at it.  Anyone interested on
helping?

Thank you,

Loren Keim

Also, for the person who mentioned that I don't have headers and
that makes life difficult, I am sorry, I'll try to remember to
put headers on from now on.  We are using IBM equipment though,
so instead of Digital equipment asking for a header, we must
physically tab to the header field and insert one (Horrors, a
machine that doesn't do it for me!)

Subject:      Conference Notes

Another quick note:

Some questions came up from various people that I neglected
to answer.  WHEN would we have such a conference.  If we
hold it too soon, people won't have time to plan it into
their schedules, but if we have it this year yet and after
mid October, we're running the risk of hitting Prof's
midterms and finals.

I'm leaning towards the second weekend in October.   I'd also
like to know if enough people would be interested in attending.
We've had around 60 replies, but that doesn't mean they are
definitely coming.  I'd like to know who is seriously interested
in such a conference so we can plan ahead.  I don't see a
serious problem because we are said to have around 6000 people
on this listserv (this is an unsupported number because
this is a closed listserv and we cannot ask it who is on or
how many).

We've also gotten some final comments asking "Oh Where Oh
Where is David Slade?"

Re; occaision requests for means of contacting Eric Newhouse

Since this request pops up about every couple of months, I'll leave
the answer on the list....

Eric Newhouse has no BitNet access at this time.  He can be accessed
though the BBS he runs-

The Crest BBS in Los Angeles, CA. : (213) 471-2518

His mailing address is
Eric Newhouse
1834 Old Orchard Rd.
Los Angeles, CA  90049   USA

If anyone wants to relay messages to him, I am willing to do it since
I call him on the BBS twice a month at least. (Do I ever need
PC Pursuit! :-) No ad intended, just a comment on modem weary phone
bill.) In a few months, a couple of the BBS systems that I work with are
seeking to add the capability to connect to USENET. Maybe with a
more "PC-ready" access, Eric Newhouse can have a BITNET link.

Thank you.

PS: Ken, my apologies for the file slipping through. Still experimenting
with the various TRANSMIT options that are supposed to turn files into

First, thanks Ken for clearing up the number of people on the
list.  I thought my information was a bit nhigh.  (Shame,
Chris, Shame).

Second, we've gotten quite a few interesting comments on
speakers.  We've gotten more people asking for speakers.
The only new addition is Dr. Highland.  I am unfamiliar
with him, or perhaps I'm not putting him in the right context.

The majority of people who wrote asked about panel
conferences.  To tell the truth, I would rather have
a few speeches given, and have some roundtable discussion
groups.   I'm sure some would be interested in listending to
lectures, but I think we'd bget a bit more out of some
discussion groups as well.

We had two people also ask that the conference be located
near Philadelpihia.  Again, if we hold it in the Valley or
at Lehigh, we are 45 minutes up route 309 (Broad St
Philly)... provided you don't hit too many lights.  Or
an hour and 15 min up the turnpike.

I'd still klike to hear from people interested in the conference
and I'd like to know if the second weekend in October is stoo
early.

I am sure I can set up a good conference by that time, I'm more
worried about people working it into their schedules.

Regarding Hotels, we have quite a variety orf them.  The range
is 28 dollars a night up to 115 dollars a night.   You can get
very nice accomodations here for around 35 a night, or even
nice accomodations for a little less.  The total conference
cost (without hotel) we could probably squeeze in for around
25.00 including a dinner.   I have checked and we can hold a
nice banquet for about 35 a person, and we can add on another
5-15 for snacks at the conference, booklets to go lalong
withthe conference.

Any preference?

Subject:      Virus outbreak -- Brain type?

Hello!

We seem to have a small outbreak of a virus here at Yale University.  The virus
resides on the boot sector of any diskette (DSDD or DSHD -- we did not try any
3.5" disks).  It does not seem to infect hard disks.  Typically, somebody
would try to start a computer with an infected disk and get only a blinking
cursor.  When the computer would not start normally, the user would get some
other system disk and do a warm boot.  At this stage, if the new system disk
is not write-protected, the viral code gets written onto its boot sector and
the user still has a blinking cursor only.  If the new system disk is
write-protected, the machine seems to start normally; however, the virus code
is still in memory and any subsequent warm boot with a non-write-protected
disk infects that disk.  Any other disk accesses -- format, copy, dir, del,
cd -- do not seem to spread this virus.

As far as I can tell, this seems to be a variant of the Brain virus; however,
there is no Brain or brain signature anywhere in it (or any other recognizable
text, for that matter).

The obvious solution would be to educate users to use write-protected boot
disks and to cold-boot the computer whenever they start a session.  Is there
anything else we should watch out for?  Doe anybody have any experience with
this specific virus?  We'll be glad for any help!

Subject:      RE: Campus virus letter

To the group: (especially Len Levine)

     I reviewed your virus letter that you put on the list last Wednesday,
and I found it to be very useful.  I am in the process of researching, and
preparing much the same type of paper for our university.  I do have a couple of






suggestions that you may find useful, and then again you may not....
     I agree with the earlier posting (I forgot who it was), which criticized
the grave tone of a good bit of the paper.  I don't know about your university,
but I don't feel that we are in that deep of a threat of our own students
inventing such beastly programs.  I say this because I myself am a student, and
I know the majority of the Computer Science types on the campus.  I simply don't
feel that anyone here has that much knowledge and capability.  (You must realize
that I attend a smaller university than most... we average 13,000 students in
the Fall over the past couple of years).  What I do fear is the HIGH probability
that these students have been in contact with some of the other students at
other universities and will, either on accident or on purpose, return with some
sort of Virus program in their software.
     You mentioned in your posting that 'your audience will be faculty and staff
who are reasonable, but do not understand computers or computering'.  I feel
that this is a good estimate of my intentions for my audience.  With this in
mind I feel that the material needs to be explained a little better.  Not even
ALL of our Computer Science majors know what a Virus is, I surely don't expect
a chemistry professor to deduce my meaning of a VIRUS in the context of the
article.  With this in mind I have decided to begin my article with a definition
or two, positively to include that of a VIRUS.  THIS IS WHERE I WOULD LIKE SOME
HELP FROM 'THE GROUP'.  Below I will _attempt_ to derive some sort of
definition, and would greatly appreciate any and all criticism and suggestions!

Computer Virus - A program which poisons ones computer software.  A program
which is usually capable of attaching itself to other programs upon the
execution of any number of DOS commands.  Usually written with malicious intent,
capable of performing any task from displaying a simple message, to destroying
hardware AND software.  These programs can be made to execute their mailicous
acts upon any pre-determined sequence of events, such as a certain keystroke or
at a specified date and time.  These programs usually are not visible by the
simple DOS "DIR" command, making them 'invisible' to the unsuspecting user.

..well?  Please, I make no attempt at declaring myself to be a VIRUS expert, or
even extensively knowledgeable of them.  I merely do the best I can.  I would
appreciate any hints, revisions, advice, etc.

   Finally, thank you Len for providing the article to base our defenses upon.

You'd be surprised...  The sad fact is that writing a relatively simple
virus does not require all that much knowledge and/or capability.  The
average CS student (particularly one who's done some 8088) could write
a PC virus in very little time.  All it takes is the inclination to do so.
I'm sure that none of your university's students are ever disgruntled for
one reason or another...?

That's definitely a real threat, but don't write off an inside job.

Sounds a little like terror tactics, imho.  Fred Cohen's definition of a virus
goes something like - A program which attaches itself to another program and,
upon interpretation, copies (a possibly evolved version of) itself to other
program(s).  (This isn't verbatim, but the jist of it is pretty much the
same...)  Perhaps if you start by just defining a virus for what it is, and
point out that a virus can also carry a Trojan horse which can be triggered
to be activated sometime in the future.  It's probably not
a good idea to hype up the idea of a virus; just treat it as a program like
any other program.  My opinion...

I'm Clarkson's micro wizard.  If we get hit with a virus, everyone will
turn to me to fix it.  I'm the recognized expert.  However, when I cry
"virus coming", no one believes me.  They all believe in the ostrich
theory of virus prevention--don't talk about it and the students won't
write/import them.  Fortunately, they do think that people should be
warned to reboot before using a public machine.

Is there any validity to their point or *should* we tell the students
about viruses?

I think that our case, here at Lehigh, shoots their "ostrich theory"
down the tubes; we didn't tell our students about viruses, and we did
get infected by a virus.  Prior to the attack, there was little in the
way of virus education, with the notable exception of Dr. Cohen's
course in Computer Security.  It's possible that one of his students
learned about viruses from his course...but that is largely a moot
point now with all of the publicity that viruses have received in
the last 8 months or so.  My feeling is that *not* telling them about
viruses, at this point, is the danger; they've probably already heard
about them, and may even feel like experimenting now.  The reason that
it is dangerous to not tell them is that they (currently) have no way
of knowing what dangers exist other than what they may have read in
the press...  Tell/warn them about viruses and they might a) be more
careful in sharing programs, b) make safe backups to protect themselves,
c) try to write their own.

I am not sure that detailed warnings about viruses are necessary (there are so
many rumors about them anyway).  I do think one should warn users to take the
following precautions:

1.  Use a write-protected system disk whenever possible.

2.  When you start using a public machine, TURN IT OFF first, then turn it on
    with your system disk in drive A.

Just booting (warm booting) would not be enough -- we had a virus that spread
itself that way.

Russ, I think we've had quite a few of these arguments before
about teaching fviruses.  I don't think it was the oworldn't
(Again please excuse my typing, this modem program hates my
backspace), I don't think it wwas the swiftest idea in the
world to publicly announce how to defeat systems, but then didn't
popular Mechanics tell us how to create an atomic bomb?

Ken, I hate to correct you, but Fred taugh t a feull course
on computer security, he went over viruses in detail and he taught
quite a few seminars on the theory, if I remembr correctly.  He
also ha  gave out copies of his theisis on viruses and asked several
students to write viruses for him including John Hunt I f memory
serves.  He also wenet over his articles and they were posted on
bulletin boards.

To me that is teaching viruses, and I honestly think that because
he tautght them, we received one.  Someone tells me that he weven
went over command com viruses as an example one time.

Now, Fred tells us that we are lucky he discovered viruses before
someone else did.  He might be right.  But the people from University
of California and people from the AI systems here at Lehigh tell me
that all he did was create waves and destory machines.  Whether or
not he himself did damage, 3 differenct colleges tell me hie did.

Is this proliferation of viruses do to his talks and papers?  Or
would it have eventually come anyway?

Teh flipside is that many people calim viruses have been with us
since 1972, but they were small and didn't hit very hard because
all systems were unconnected and in the hands of computer experts,
where now we have large noetworks and eveybody has a computer
]and doesn't know much abou tit.

At this point itn time, we've had afar too many problems to try
to quiet the subject.  If students don't hear it forom you, they
will hear it elsewhere.  I think it ifs a good idea to wram (arn
... WARN) people of the potential problems.  (That's it, I'm
going out and getting a new modem program.  Or a copy of Kermit
would do it).

True.  I should have been more specific, and I did say that Dr. Cohen's
course was a notable exception.  What I meant was that we, the
Computing Center, didn't educate our computer users, as a whole, on
viruses.  Yes, many students took Dr. Cohen's course, and they should've
been knowledgable on viruses, but I did mean the computing community,
as a whole.

As for whether teaching about viruses catalyzes the problem or not, I
still feel that it largely a moot point since the cat *is* out of the
bag, so to speak.  The best that we can do at this point is to warn
our users of the potential for disaster.

Loren - Its actually not as hard as I made it sound(?). The 8253

        18.2 times per second by default. This interrupt can be

        0 of this chip can be modified for faster intervals.

  It's not all that easy.  DOS (and BIOS) are not re-entrant, so you
would not be able to use any DOS or BIOS calls in your program since
you would not know who was doing what where when you got the tick.
Of course, like all other TSR's you'd have contention problems with
the timer tick.  What about all the other people (including DOS)
who expect that tick to be at 18.2?

Subject:      Virii and Screen Output

Given the open memory of DOS and the fact that (it seems) any program
can take over the memory space of any other program, and also the
fact that ROM BIOS calls can be used to create screen output, is it
possible to create a virus which, after insertion into a program is
undetectable by a program like LIST.COM or a sector editor? In other
words, once the virus knows that a program is doing a disk read of
the section it's hiding in, can this hypothetical virus then fool the
system into thinking that the legitimate code is still in place? I think
that the capability to examine sectors on a disk is a big help in
combatting these things and wonder whether a clever virus could mask
its existence in this fashion.

The short, obvious and trivial answer to your question is that if you
can conceive it, and if it could be done by any other program, then it
can be done by a virus.

Subject:      Viruses and Screen Output

David.Slonosky@QUEENSU.CA wonders if a very clever virus couldn't
"hide" really well by subverting the output from sector-examiners
and things, to lie about the true condition of the disk, and make
it look like things are normal (uninfected).
  As someone else said, the answer is sort of "yes".   On the
other hand, the simple way to do this (just intercepting the
BIOS calls to read the sector of the disk that the virus is on,
and returning a false "uninfected" image of the sector to the
caller), won't really work for a virus, for the simple and
amusing reason that such a virus could hardly spread!  When you
did a COPY, or a LOAD-AND-EXECUTE, or a boot, or whatever, the
system would call BIOS to get the code to execute, the virus
would intercept that call and return an uninfected image, the
system would then copy (or load, or boot from) that uninfected
image, and it would be as though the virus never existed!  So
it wouldn't spread very well.   To make this work, a virus
would have to be REAL clever, and present an uninfected image
when examination was being done, but an infected image when
the data was actually going to be used as code.   Sounds sort of
hard to do, to say the least...
  Not to say that it's impossible, of course.  But it's not as
simple as it might seem.                  DC
