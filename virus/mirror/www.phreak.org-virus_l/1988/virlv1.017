Subject:      Coming Survey

HI THERE!

Just dropping a note to inform you that in the next couple of days,
you will be graced with a survey.

This survey is for a research paper that we are doing on Malicious
software(Such as Viruses, Worms, Trojan Horses, etc.).  The survey
will attempt to determine what problems you or your organization has
had from malicious software and the results. I am sure that you will
all be jumping at the opportunity to help us with our research.

The responses will be kept confidential and the results will be posted
back to this list.  The survey should be sent on Tuesday or Wednesday
(22 or 23 Nov).  Hope to be hearing from you soon.

(Note: Detailed instructions will be included in the preamble to the
       survey)

greetings netters!

We seem to have been hit by a virus.  What do you know?
The following is what we know at 6:30 est 11/21/88.

1. ibmpc's with hard disk
2. dos
3. infected files have the following TWO characters all
   over them "@smiley face".  That's hex 30 02 as my key
   board does not have the right keys.
4. infected program files seem to stop operations
5. we know that the virus can be copied when a file is
   copied or in an infected file
6. the virus wipes out the root directory of a hard disk

Have others seen this one?  Have we given it a name?
(how about @ sh*tface?)  ;>  Anywhere to look for
more info?

Send stuff to me at the following addresses:

        bitnet          dac@cunyvms1
        internet        dac%cunyvms1.bitnet@cunyvm.cuny.edu

or something like that depending on the state of mind of the
computer you are sending from and if it's new to this group
I'll summarize to the net.

BTW, "we" are the academic computer center for the Graduate
School at City Univ. of New York.  This is our second known
virus, as we just beat back a benign version of "brain" with
help from Virus-L.  Yah!

Be talking at ya,

Subject:  Hardware damage...

Hello everyone,

        On the topic of hardware damage caused by a virus (somebody
impail me if my memory isn't correct about this one!), I seem to
remember about 4 or 5 years ago, I big discussion about a program
(virus, whatever!) that would literally fry all of the chips in
certain Radio Shack portable computers.  If memory serves me correct,
it worked by setting some of the interrupts accessed by the CPU (for
clock speed), to a different value, causing the CPU to overheat and
fail.  I know that you can modify the CPU speed on Radio Shack Color
Computers by a simple poke to a given address, which causes the CPU
speed to double.  You can quadruple the speed of the CPU, but buy then
the associated chips, (like the address multiplexing chip) cannot keep
up.  This little poke was employed by quite a few software vendors to
speed up the execution time of their programs -

The book "Online Auditing Using Microcomputers" ($28) by
computer-security specialist Jerry FitzGerald has computing tips and
14 free vaccines.  To order, write FitzGerald Associates, 506

Has anyone heard of this?  Does anyone know what the 14 free vaccines
are?  Are they worth anything, or just public domain/sharewear files?

Subject:  Prosecution of Morris

There seem to be two camps here: one says prosecute the hell out of
this guy, the other says go easy on him.

The prosecution camp's rationale seems to be this: by maximizing the
penalty for damaging programming, especially in a highly publicized
case, we can scare more people away from evil hacking.

The go-easy camp's rationale seems to be this: he didn't mean any
harm, so don't penalize him, even though he caused (at some estimates)
$20 million worth of damage.  [Ed. Whose estimate is that?]

I think it's pretty clear that the first camp has the stronger case.
I'm sure Union Carbide didn't mean any harm when they negligently
released poison gas in India a few years back, blinding and killing
thousands of people.  The fact remains that damage has been done, and
it is the normal practice to place the blame on the instigator,
regard- less of his or her intentions.

Consider a drunk driver who kills ten pedestrians one night.  The
driver had no intention of killing anyone, however he is still to
blame, largely because he arranged the circumstances that caused him
to kill those people.  By drinking and then driving he endangered
others.  Morris is similar in that he chose to experiment with a
dangerous program on a computer connected to the Internet.  This was
negligent behavior that demands punishment.

So there's my opinion, for what it's worth.  I'm sorry for the guy, in
the same way I might be sorry for a drunk driver, but I can't argue
that he should be treated leniently.

Hello,

Can anybody tell me if there are proceedings available from the latest
Computer Security Institute Conference (held in Miami Beach)?
And, if yes, where can you order them?
Thanks.

Subject:     Re: Jerusalem Virus... (PC)

  I must confess that I find it rather difficult to understand the
messages that have been coming from Pedro Sepulveda J. on the
so-called "Jerusalem Virus" which has appeared at his university in
Chile.  In response to his original message (Oct. 22) to VIRUS-L, I
wrote to him asking what evidence he has that what he has is really
the "Jerusalem virus".  His reply indicated similarities to the
Friday-the-13th Israeli virus, but differed in some details (which
might have been inaccuracies in his description instead of real
differences).  On Nov.  7 I sent him a description of the Israeli
virus(es), but have received no reply from him.

  Now (Issue 15 of the digest) he tells us that
>   it has been  developed a program which take out  the JV virus
>   from the  .COM files.

Well, all I can say that if this really is the "Jerusalem Virus" (i.e.
the Friday-the-13th or any other Israeli virus) then Pedro and Co. are
re-inventing the wheel, since (as was published in VIRUS-L and many
other newsletters and digests) we developed an antidote for both COM
and EXE files over 10 months ago.  And if this is not an Israeli
virus, then why on earth does Pedro insist on calling it the
"Jerusalem virus"???
