Subject: Media (virus) humor vs. disinformation

This weekend, a friend of mine gave me some political cartoons that he
had found in some publications (I don't know which ones).  The
cartoons were somewhat amusing, but certainly showed that there must
still be quite a lot of confusion in the media as to what a virus even
is.  For example, two robots (which beared no resemblance to, say, a
PUMA robot...) were shown - one says to the other, "Oh, I'll be ok,
it's just a virus that I picked up from a computer."  In another, a
military defense system is shown with a large screen saying something
like:

WARNING: INCOMING MISSILES
TARGET:  MIX EGG WHITES UNTIL FLUFFY

All the while, two generals are saying, "Must be a virus".  (This
isn't verbatim, but that's the jist of it.)  Also, in a third cartoon,
a computer operator is saying something like, "the vote tallying
computer is infected by a virus, we'll have to hold the election over
again".

My reaction - Oh no.

Subject: RE: prosecution of Mr. Morris

On the subject of the prosecution of Mr. Morris, and virus
perpetrators in general, a lot has been said regarding the man-hours
required to clean up the mess, and equate that to a dollar cost.
However, nobody has rationalized that equation.  In other words, would
the system maintainers have been doing if they hadn't been getting rid
of the worm?  What was the actual value of computer time lost?  If
schedules were slipped due to computer unavailability, what was the
cost associated with that?  Who were the real money losers?  Granted,
any way you slice the pie, the U.S. government is probably going to
come out the biggest loser, whether it's due to government employees
cleaning up a government owned computer, or contractor employees doing
the same on a cost plus contract.  However, I feel the calculation of
the actual dollars lost may be a lot more elusive than simply
multiplying dollars by hours, and in the Morris case could be much
larger or much smaller than the $20 million estimation being bandied
about.

Subject: Computer Virus Eradication Act of 1988

    I just received a copy of HR-5061, a new bill being introduced
    in the House by Wally Herger (R-CA) and Robert Carr (D-Mich.).
    The text of the bill is included below (see disclaimer).

    It sounds to me like there are some subscribers to VIRUS-L
    who's background is more criminal law than computer science,
    perhaps some of you could help the rest of us out with a little
    commentary.  Would this bill be helpful to you?  Do you think
    you would be able to get a conviction with it?  Do you think
    you would be able to recover your damages with it (and how would
    you go about defining those damages if you were to use the law)?

    If people are interested in sending their comments to the
    authors, I include the name and address of the legislative
    aide who has been working on this bill.  If people would like
    to e-mail their comments, you can send them to me and I will
    mail them to him in a packet (be sure to include your name and
    normal postal mail adress, as congress isn't on the net).

                    Happy trails,
                        Don Alvarez

Subject: Morris and the worm

Something I've noticed in the many notes present within this group --
most, if not all, of them discuss the Novemberm, or
has been convicted beyond a reasonable doubt.  Let us remember that in
this country, it's innocent until proven guilty, not guilty as soon as
the FBI arrests you.

If you've not read the Worm analysis, I suggest doing so.  It provides
an interesting insight into the possibility that Morris may not have
written the worm, or may not have done so alone.  It cites examples of
poor coding, inconsistent coding, and poor algorithmic use.

Subject: Internet Worm report available in ASCII format now

A hearty thanks to Len Levine who has (painstakingly, no doubt) taken
the PostScript file of Gene Spafford's report on the Internet worm and
converted it to straight ASCII text (well, PostScript is ASCII, but
not very readable to most of us...)!

So, my U.S. mail distribution of the file can now include eitherk (360k or 1.2 meg MS-DOS),
and I'll mail it back to you.  If you want both the PS and the DOC
file, send two 360k disks or one 1.2 meg disk.  Oh yeah, first e-mail
me a request for my postal address.

Thanks again, Len!

Subject: Virus Conference (Arlington, Virginia)

A flyer about a virus conference just came across my desk, and I was
wondering if anyone else has heard about it and is considering
attending.  Entitled "Preventing and Containing Computer Virus
Attacks", it takes place January 30-31, in Arlington, VA.  Speakers
include Representative Wally Herger (R-CA), a special agent from the
FBI, John Landry (ADAPSO virus committee chairman), Patricia Sission
from NASA, as well as a collection of attorneys and business folk.
Conference is chaired by Dave Douglass, no info provided.

Have you heard anything about any of these people?  Or any info that
would help     4550 Montgomery Avenue
        Suite 700N
        Bethesda, MD   20814-3382


I've had such mixed success with seminars and conferences that I tend to
get jumpy when I see one that I might want to attend.
