Subject:      Whole Earth Catalog virus prevention section

I just saw an advance issue of the new Whole Earth Catalog, which is now
called contact and published by Crown Publishers, 255 Park Ave South, NY
NY I believe.  (Stewart Brand, who originated the WEC idea) gave a talk
in Banff and he was waving it around.  It has a fairly extensive section
on viruses and virus prevention programs, as well as other technology
related types of stuff, and looks well worth reading.  It may be in the
bookstores already, though Stewart didn't think so.  I will check in New
York City next week.

Fortunately, in the United States, a civilian is assumed innocent
until proven guilty. I say let the normal course of "justice" take its
course.  All any of us on this list have to go on is "hearsay".

[Ed. Does anyone have any reliable updates in the RTM case?  There's
been a lot of debate (on the Usenet group comp.protocols.tcp-ip) as to
whether or not Mr. Morris should be charged.  Some say that, "he
didn't intend for the harm..." while others say "regardless of intent,
harm was done...".  It will be interesting to see just what happens in
this case.  How do others feel about it?]

The UH Business School was hit by the Brain virus.  According to news
reports, they handled it fairly quickly, and limited damage.
According to the Houston Chronicle, some students reported minor loss
of data, but the quotes out of the administration indicated that it
was more of a nuisance than a disaster.

Earlier today, I sent out a re-posting of some virus-related RISKS digest
material.  In editing the message, I believe that I removed some relevant
information inadvertantly.  To clarify what was removed:


Subscription/unsubscription requests for the RISKS forum should be
sent to:

<RISKS-Request@CSL.SRI.COM>

Submissions to the RISKS forum should be sent to:

<RISKS@CSL.SRI.COM>


I apologize for any confusion that this may have caused.

Ken

The Virus That Hit Houston... whatta name for a movie.  A Brain or
"brain"-type virus hit the University of Houston's College of Business
recently.  Technicians say they've got it under control, but students
are still grumbling about lost info.  That's the scoop.
