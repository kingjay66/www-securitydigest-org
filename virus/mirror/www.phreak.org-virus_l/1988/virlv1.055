Warm boots and cold boots differ in the amount of memory they clear
when they are executed.  A cold boot is considered to be when the
machine's power is cut, and then turned back on be it by flipping the
switch, pulling the plug or whatever other metaphor/method you want to
toss in here.  A warm boot is simply a reset which can be done by
issuing a system command, pressing an interrupt/ reset switch or
whatever.

The point is that with a warm boot, the system still has power, so
some areas of memory can retain data, even though much of it is
cleared. Thus, it is conceivable that a virus could survive a warm
boot if it was off in a secluded/ non-general area of memory.  Usually
when a warm boot occurs, the only thing that is cleared is main memory
and lots of pointers and tables are reset.  Special caches, ram-disks,
clock/calendar memory, all normally retain their contents prior to the
warm boot.

Subject: Re: software override of write protect tabs?

In my IBM tech reference, in the section for the diskette drive: "If
the diskette is write-protected, a write protect sensor disables the
drive's circuitry, and an appropriate signal is sent to the interface
(diskette controller)."

Also:
"The write protect sensor disables the diskette drive's electronics
whenever a write protect tab is applied to the diskette."

In the section on the diskette adapter:
"Write Enable line (from the adapter to the drive): The drive disables
write current in the head unless this line is active."

In the schematics in back, the diagram for the diskette drive has the
Write Protect sensor (on the drive) and the Write Enable line (from
the controller) wired in such a way that WP must be false and WE must
be true in order for a logic 0 to be applied to a pin of some mystery
IC.  I'm not an electronics expert, but it seems likely to me that the
drive won't let the controller override the WP switch.  If this is
true, then there's no way for software to override it either.

It is Mr. Dvorak's style to be provocative.  In the interest of that
style he often crosses the line between reporting and speculating.  I
am not aware of any evidence that this assertion of his is any more
substantial than any of his others.  While we do not seem to have
discovered any sanctions to discourage the rude, disorderly, impolite,
and irresponsible behavior of the non-professionals in our midst, you
can be sure that the market would mete prompt and effective sanctions
against vendors behaving in such a manner.

There are a few anecdotes in other markets of firms that tried to
trash the reputations of their competitors.  Most of these backfired,
but none are recorded to have been successful.  There is no reason to
believe that this market is any different.

Only users have a greater interest in an orderly marketplace than do
vendors.  Vendors seem to have a better idea of where their real
interests rest.

You need not hope idly for the end of a practice for which the only
evidence of its existence is sensational assertion.

     This assumes the disk is bootable?  I am sending out disks
with NOTHING on them but copied ascii files using the dos copy
command.  They are formated with the format command and then
copied.  No system.  What dangers remain?

     Still not clear on this.  If I put a fresh floppy in the A drive
and format it, can the virus be laid down on the floppy at this time?
If I then copy files from the C drive, can the virus be laid down at
this time?

     If I attempt to warm boot the machine with the empty floppy in
place, this results in a failure to boot of course, but can the virus
be laid down at this time?

     Let's say the floopy gets infected.  How can it then infect
another machine?  During a warm or cold boot with the floppy in
place (causing boot failure)?

     If the floppy is infected must it have bad sectors?  Won't
checkdsk find this out?  If the disk has no bad sectors, does this
mean the floppy is clean of all or just certain viruses?

     The implication in a past posting is that some brain viruses
will cause debug to not execute properly d0:0.  Is this the boot
sector?  And is this correct about brain?
