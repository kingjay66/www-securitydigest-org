Subject:      Digest or not digest - the decision


With about 50 votes in (out of about 380 people on the VIRUS-L list),
I've decided what to do about the digest/moderate "problem".  First,
though, I want to thank everyone who sent me their vote!  All of your
suggestions were great, and I hope that my decision will accomodate
as many of you as possible!

The decision: The list will remain unmoderated and undigested.  *BUT*,
I now have the back logs set to be stored on a weekly basis (as opposed
to a monthly basis).  So, those of you who prefer digest format can
pick up a weekly VIRUS-L "digest" from the LISTSERV, and unsubscribe
from the list itself.  The weekly log filenames are of the form:
VIRUS-L LOGyymmx (where yy is 88 for 1988, etc., mm is month, and x
corresponds to the week - A for week 1, etc.).  So, the first log file
in June, 1988 would be VIRUS-L LOG8806A.  So, once a week (or whenever),
anyone who wants the digest can just send a GET VIRUS-L LOGyymmx #ovmand
to LISTSERV@LEHIIBM1.BITNET.  If you want to submit something to
the list, you'll have to send them to me, and I'll forward them to
the list (since only registered subscribers can submit articles).

I hope that this decision will be satisfactory to as many of you as
is possible.  My reasoning behind the decision (as is evidenced by
the responses that I got) is that the current volume of traffic is
still low enough to keep non-digest believers happy, and that moderating
(censoring) is best left to the discretion of the readers.  This is
what the majority of responses requested - the overall vote count
was 36 to 15.

In addition, I'd like to briefly (if that's still possible :-) point
out a rule of netiquette that I'd like to see followed a bit more
closely here on VIRUS-L.  Please send responses to queries directly
to the author of the query - not to the entire list.  That way, the
author can send in a summary of his/her responses to the list, and
it *should* keep redundant traffic to a minimum.  This isn't an attempt
to discourage discussions, it's merely an attempt to keep the quality
of VIRUS-L mail to a maximum.

Thank you for your time.  Comments and suggestions, as always, are
welcomed - send them to me directly at LUKEN@LEHIIBM1.BITNET.

Would it not be appropriate for someone teaching a virus class to
simply use the classic technique of "pseudo-machine" code? It requires
more preparation on the part of the professor, but if he simply
created some "virtual machine" which only existed as a sub-program or
simulation somewhere, the virii could only infect this pseudo-machine.

This would be far superior to testing it on, say, MSDOS/IBM-PC where
the substrate exists in many places; without the appropriate
pseudo-machine to infect, the virus would die, or at least fail to
propagate. There are medical analogues to this technique, specifically
working with E. coli (bacteria, not virus) which is harmless to humans.

So, does anyone know of existing pseudo-machines which are available
off the shelf, which could be used for this purpose? The MARS
(core-wars) system comes to mind, though it is perhaps too simple...

  Even though John Applegate's contention that computer spread virii and

he arrived at that conclusion.

  In my case I have never seen anything virii but the subject is of great

understand why someone would knowingly spread a computer illness around.
It makes no sense.  Here at Temple, to the best of my knowledge, I have not
heard of any virii invasions.  Our students do not have use of hard disk
based machines and most are not aware of the capability of using BITNET.
But even though I have never seen the destruction a computer virus might do,
I would have to be very ignorant to say that none exist.  I have never seen
a person with lung cancer from smoking legal and illegal substances but that
certainly doesn't mean that lung cancer does not exist.

Subject:      Virus-writing classes

Although there is disagreement about the ethics of teaching students about
virus writing, so far everyone (at least, everyone whose submission I've seen)
seems to feel that it's good programming tuition.  Well yes, in some ways it
is, but surely the question *should* be whether the same gains could be
provided in less damaging ways.  Let's look at what it is about a virus which
makes writing one good training:

1.      It needs to interact with the system at a low level, teaching the
        student a lot about the particular system and about low-level
        programming in general (someone who's successfully written a typical
        virus on a PC, for example, will have a good understanding of interrupts
        and disk structure);

2.      It needs to be small if it is to remain undetected, so the student
        will gain experience in writing compact code;

3.      It *may* need to be pretty fast (for example, if it's doing a fair
        amount of work during a frame sync), teaching the student how to
        hone code for speed;

4.      It should remain undetected as long as possible, even if the victim
        is looking for it, so the student learns to think carefully about
        how the 'user' (can one talk about the 'user' of a virus?) will
        behave.

There are probably other points, but these will do.  Note that this is *not*
a list of the salient points of a virus - I've not mentioned self-replication,
for example, because (correct me if I'm wrong) the skill of writing self-
replicating code is not exactly of general utility (though I'll admit I can't
see into the future).

Well, I think it's pretty obvious that there are *benign* programming projects
which will teach all of these skills.  How about device drivers, for example?
(I'm a Mess-DOS novice, so I'm not sure quite how what I mean by a 'device
driver' relates to the PC world, but I guess you know what I mean).

What I'm *not* saying is that the professor shouldn't have taught those classes,
period.  Academic freedom is a very important principle and should not be
lightly surrendered.  What I'm saying is that if he'd taken the trouble to
look I'm sure he'd have found a much safer way of imparting the skills he
rightly regarded as important.  I hope he grows up soon.

In other words, for educational purposes, have your class write viruses

Subject:      Pseudo-machines and existence.

I curious - what would a pseudo-machine virus do to indicate its
virusness?  I've seen compilers written to produce code on pseudo-
machines.  The code gets interpreted by the pseudo-machine later.
What does pseudo-machine virus code do?  A good virus would have to
be self-replicating.  If the pseudo-machine provides disk I/O,
there's no technique I know of that the pseudo-machine could use to
prevent virus spread.  If the virus is to be a good example, it must
infect something.  Perhaps it infects other pseudo-code?  Students
are still perfectly free to have it infect regular machine-code, or
possibly the pseudo-code interpreter.  While infections of pseudo-
code must be done with pseudo-code, infections of normal machine-code
will be just as virulent as ever, since they'll require machine-code.

I never heard the guy say viruses don't exist.  It sounded to me like
he said:

This is an expression of a consensus of opinion that specifically
states that viruses may exist.

I've never seen a virus myself.  I've heard of two: a MS-DOS virus that
infects COMMAND.COM, and a Unix virus in the AT&T C compiler that
prints a happy birthday message for the author every year.

Well, I don't know about this claim. From my experience on the Mac, only
real people who have had real problems have been writing programs to
get rid of viruses. I don't think people who are distributing software
for free are profiting all that much from a virus plague, imaginary or real.

Subject:      Virus 101 class...

My general feeling about this is that the idea was good, but it was the
execution that was flawed.  Some sort of "confined" pseudo-environment would
have been more appropriate for viral development, if the project itself was
apprpriate in the first place.  Which I think it was.  Mind you I say the
*IDEA*, not the actual way it was executed(trying to avoid the FLAMES of
hellfire--not to mention those of the net).  What it comes down to is basically
something that society has gone over and over in countless other fields.
How do you teach somebody how to make a strain of wheat grow 50% larger than
normal?---teach them genetic engineering...How do we keep the country safe from
others nuking it?--educate people on how to assemble missiles for ourselves...
How can you teach people to defuse a bomb?--try starting with what makes on tick
Of course there's nothing to prevent prevent anybody from taking any of this
sort of knowledge and perverting it into something destructive(making their own
virus, building their own a-bomb,etc.) save for numerous preliminary tests,
security clearances, and basically trusting them(which is what is ULTIMATELY
comes down to), which really isn't worth that much in hand....
You can either lock up the information and hide it away on the grounds that its
too dangerous and destructive for anyone to know,(which doesn't stop those out
there who know already), or you can give it to people who(hopefully) you can
trust will put it to appropriate use. There really isn't any other option...

As to whoever said that Virii don't exist
Trust me, they do, I've seen them and lost numerous files and floppies to the
peksy buggers...We got majorly "(c)BRAIN"ed this past semester here at George
Mason, and it wasn't funny...
However, I must admit that I have only seen 2 strains so far..the "Brain" virus
and the PLAYBOY virus, both of which only affect PCs....
They certainly aren't as big a threat as the media would like them to be, but
they are out there....

Even before the advent of VIRUS-L, the lists occasionally flurried
with reports of viruses and trojans as they were discovered.  The
obvious practice is to notify the archive servers, so that the
infection can be nipped-in-the-bud.  Perhaps it has been this
practice of voluntary cooperation that has prevented any major
epidemics from occurring, and a consequent low observation rate.

"System simulates viral attacks on PCs

"The National Bulletin Board Society has developed a computer virus testing
system to simulate viral attacks on IBM PCs.  The benign pseudo-virus,
called Universal Viral Simulator, reportedly uses all known techniques
found in live viruses to infect and replicate in host systems.  It is based
on analyses of live viruses submitted to the BBS Society.

"According to the society, the simulator is meant to act as a testing and
verification mechanism for antiviral systems under development.  The viral
simulator is executed after any antiviral systems have been loaded
and activated.  Each time the antiviral system blocks it, it displays
a message naming the replication attempt technique and its failure.  If
the simulator succeeds in `infecting' the system, it identifies the procedure
used.

"The Universal Viral Simulator is available from the National BBS Society
for $79.95."

Wrong... depending on the driver (and possibly other things?) your hard disk
will probably auto-remount itself in a matter of seconds. It may take a while
if the CPU gets very busy, which could fool you into thinking that you're safe.
Anyway, while I've never had occasion to use it, the S-O-C-Del combo is safer.
It may in fact make it impossible for ANY software to put your SCSI drive on-
line, but I doubt it. I do know (99% sure) that a sufficiently clever virus
could find and use even an unmounted hard disk, assuming you can put yours in
that state (didn't a fellow named Paul Mercer write a CDEV that could do this?)
Therefore, presuming that S-O-C-Del does not unalterably change some state in
the SCSI controler (or something like that), it is impossible to guarantee
protection to your hard disk without physically cutting off the data (or at
least the write) lines between it and the computer.

At this point, either solution is probably safe, but they won't be when virus
writers start getting a little more sophisticated.

This is nonsense, for several reasons.
1) There isn't enough room in the PRAMs to store even the simplest virus, even
   on the Mac II. (The others have, I believe, *20 WHOLE BYTES* of which 12
   are used.)
2) Even if there were, how would such a virus gain control of the system? Code
   is never stored in the PRAMs, so nothing there is ever executed.

Two gotchas, though:
1) It is possible that a virus could store a counter in the PRAMs, thus
   enabling a 'time-bomb' effect WITHOUT ever modifying anything in the System
   or elsewhere. You would never know there was anything wrong, until...
2) I know of one case where a Mac II couldn't even boot off of a FLOPPY. The
   cause was supposed to be trashed PRAMs. I don't see how this could be, but
   the person complaining was fairly expert, and they sure as hell didn't miss
   anything obvious. Furthermore, I think the problem was solved by temporarily
   shorting the PRAM battery. This was broadcast over USENET some time ago, so
   if anyone knows better please tell me. If the short did cure the problem,
   this virtually proves the trashed-PRAM hypothesis.
   The long and the short of it is that a truly nasty virus _might_ be able to
   render your Mac II logic board useless (until you short your battery). I
   don't believe this can happen to an SE, but I don't know for sure.
   In any event, DON'T short your battery unless you DAMN WELL know EXACTLY
   what you are doing!

P.S.      I've notified Rick Zellich, the maintainer of the "List of Lists,"
      of the existance of this list. I tried to make the part about sending
      subscription requests to the listserv and not to the list clear, and
      I also included the owner's address in case anyone had any questions.

      The "List of Lists" is distributed to a far wider field of people
      than any Bitnet-oriented listserv listings I've seen. It contains
      listings for Internet lists in addition to listserv lists (some of
      which it lacks because list owners don't know about it).
      If anyone wants a copy (it's big, so organizing some system of
      distribution for multiple people at one site is recommended),
      it's stored on NICSERVE@BITNIC in fragments. You'll need to get the
      index to find their names.

Actually, in the middle '70s, I used a system where self-replicating
code in the OS was common; this was in the NCR "B1" Operating System (the
name "B1" was apparently derived from the name of the principal designer,
John Burnett, and the fact that it was a single-tasking OS.  It had nothing
to do with the "B1" of computer security).

This OS, although slow and primitive, actually had a lot of interesting
innovations; one of these was VOSS, the "Variable Overlay Stasher System".
Depending on what hardware you had, and what options you wanted, you
would set a bitmap indicating which sets of overlays (sort of like current-
day "packages" or "modules") you wanted on a given disk.  (They were
called "overlays" because in fact the OS was one that used overlays, as
opposed to virtual memory, to get large programs into a small space.  Our
machine had only 32K, and the OS took up only a small fraction of that,
due to the overlaying, although the overlay swapping made the system
enormously slow.)

NCR would periodically come out with updates to the OS, which you would
install onto your first disk using a utility program.  But thereafter,
the software update would propagate itself to your other system disks in
the same way viruses propagate!  Whenever you mounted a new disk
(actually, I think whenever you opened a file on a new disk, but I can't
remember the details) the OS would check whether the new disk contained
an older version of the software than the current one; if the new disk
had older software, the OS would copy the overlays you had selected onto
the disk, replacing the old version with the new one.  In this way, as
long as you mounted all your disks eventually, all the disks would
automatically be updated once you updated the first one from the
distribution disk.*

This was more important on that system (the Century 100 Series) than
on systems nowadays because, like an old floppy disk microcomputer,
the machine only had small (removable) hard disks, and you would frequently
have to have a number of copies of the OS around on the different (small)
disks you needed to run your various programs.  Thus insuring that they
were all updated without the help of this self-updating feature would have
been difficult:  in the installation where I worked, there were around 100
disk packs, of which a significant number had the OS on them.

So, the system used the same basic technology as the virus, but for a
constructive purpose.  I recall that under some circumstances it was
possible for this updating to go the wrong way, though; it would replace
a newer version of the OS with an older version.  I can't remember what
caused this, just that the self-updating would sometimes malfunction.

*I think it required you to answer "EE" (which meant "Ok") or "CC"
 (which meant "Cancel") before it would actually update the disk.

Then it could be called a virus.  (At least it got the user's approval
before propogating...)  Remember, a virus need not be harmful.  All
that it needs to do to be classified as a virus is to replecate itself.
In Dr. Cohen's dissertation, he mentions a compression virus.  This
compression virus attaches itself (eventually) to all of the executable
files on a system and, whenever they're executed, it uncompresses them
and then loads them.  Of course, when it first infects an executable file,
it compresses it.  Such a compression virus, according to Dr. Cohen, is
capable of greatly reducing the amount of disk space that all the executable
files take up.  Thus, it is a *good* virus.  Of course, the fact that
an executable file has to be uncompressed every time it is executed
slows the computer down considerably, but nonetheless, the compression
virus is a good one.

PK36.EXE is Phil Katz's latest release (ver 3.6) of PKARC/PKXARC.
It literally blows away the competition with its new features and
speed.

Improvements include: ability to add/delete members from existing ARC
even if there is less space than required to make the new ARC (great
for floppy disk use); ability to read configuration file with your
favorite options to make them the defaults (nice for setting it to
always make SEA-compatible ARCs) but you can still override the
specified defaults with command line options; ability to display the
name and version number of the ARC maker that produced any ARC file;
optional paginated text extract to screen, and many more new features.

This copy of PK36.EXE was obtained directly from Phil Katz in order to
assure its authenticity.

     cc: SYSOP

12/27/87

There have recently been several trojan/hacked/pirated versions
of PKARC/PKXARC showing up.

The most vicious of the bunch is called NEWARKR.EXE.  This is
a (PKSFX) self-extracting file, but contains no DOCS.  The
programs PKXARC, PKARC, and PKSFX have been renamed to XARKR,
ARKR, and RKSFX respectively.  The PKWARE copyright has been
removed from these programs, along with PKWARE's address and
all references to ShareWare.  The Copyright notice has been
replaced with the phrase "Public Domain Software".  These
programs have been modified in other means too, and their
reliability is unknown.

Equally malicious, there has been a trojan patch for PKXARC that
has been cirulated.  It is a copy of a valid message from me
posted on USENET, except the patch given in the message has been
changed to write directly to the FAT and wipe out disk C.

There have been also various files circulated claiming to be
PKARC/PKXARC versions 3.6 and 5.3.  These are all hacked or
pirated.

The perpetrators of these hacks are guilty of Copyright infringement,
theft, libel with malice, or other applicable crimes.  PKWARE Inc. will
seek to prosecute these individuals to the fullest extent of the law.

If you see any file claiming to be a new version of PKARC/PKXARC
or a patch to those programs, and are unsure of their origin,
please check the following BBS's for the authentic files:

PKWARE BBS      414-352-7176
EXEC-PC         414-964-5160
RBBS OF CHICAGO 312-352-1035
SOUND OF MUSIC  516-536-8723

If you do encounter any hacked or pirated files, please inform
the SYSOP of the system with these files to delete them immediately.
Please also inform PKWARE inc. of these files, their origin, and all
other information that you have available.  We can be reached
at either any of the above BBS numbers, or 414-352-3670 voice.
Only with your help can these very sick individuals be prevented
from causing harm to unsuspecting victims of these hacked and
pirated programs.

Don't short your battery anyway.

I have forgotten the procedure, but I remember that there is a way
(by holding down a combination of keys, or the mouse and some keys,
but I don't recall) that will cause the parameter RAM to be reinitialized
during system startup (the ROM checks for this combination and resets
the RAM before it looks to see what is in the RAM, so prior contents
don't affect it).  This was added specifically for the models of Macintosh
that had nonremovable batteries, and was put in before the ones with
the nonremovable batteries even came out.

I remember this from when I was working for one of the Mac applications
software developers over a year ago; it was in the pre-release technical
documentation.  But since I don't program Macintoshes any more I don't
remember the procedure; does anybody else know what it is?  I guess it
is remotely possible that they removed it from the startup code, but I
kind of doubt it; Apple engineers aren't that forgetful, that they would
not provide a way to reinitialize the PRAM.  For one thing, they have
to initialize it when they first assemble the machines...

        I have sent several detailed FSP bug reports to Greenberg
        at this address, but have never received any response.

        Greenberg's style seems to flame those who report FSP
        bugs with that arrogant "what do you expect for a lousy
        ten bucks" attitude of his.

        Perhaps his surface mail address should be posted, too,
        since he doesn't appear to respond to email.  It is:

                Ross Greenberg

                594 3rd Avenue

        Personally, when Ross first asked for $10, I sent him
        a little more than that because I thought his efforts
        should be rewarded in some small way.  I'm sorry now
        that I did.  I dare say his FSP has probably caused
        more damage than the viruses it was supposed to protect
        us from.

I believe that you are referring to the standard PRAM-zapping procedure for
both the SE and II: Hold down the command, option, and shift keys while
selecting the control panel from the apple menu. In any event, there is no
other user procedure to do this that is documented *anywhere* (of course you
can write your own code to do it...)

At any rate, this does not cover the circumstances I was describing. That
situation was extremely unusual. I did not say that the Hard Disk wouldn't
boot. I said that the WHOLE MAC II wouldn't boot- even from floppies. Thus
there was no way to zap the PRAMS.

I also didn't say that I believe this story. I simply find it likely since
it comes from what I believe to be a reliable source. On the other hand, I
don't understand how the PRAM settings can affect a floppy boot-up, so for
now, it's a confirmed maybe...

Not so. The ROM checksums the PRAMS, and if it sees that they don't have
some correct value, it resets them to some known state. Zapping the PRAMs
simply writes garbage (zeros?) to them so that the next time you boot, they
get reset.

Short your battery?  That's dangerous advice...many batteries explode
when shorted, some of them violently.  In addition, it is likely you
will give your PRAMs a mild shock from static electricity, and possibly
damage them majorly.

You might try removing the battery and shorting the terminals on the
battery socket or whatever.  This also may zap your PRAMs.

Safest would be to take the battery out and wait a minute or so for
the PRAMs to forget stuff.  It may take longer than this, depending
on the capacitance of the power supply; there might be bypass caps
sitting on it, and the PRAMs are probably LP devices.

The point is: don't short batteries, if you value your computer.

1) Mac II's don't have battery sockets. They are soldered in.
2) I know that this is dangerous. The alternative was to trash a Mac II's

PURPOSE:

    This document outlines the various types of commonly found
viruses and suggests measures that can be taken to minimize the
risks of infection and procedures that may be used to recover
from infected systems.

TYPES OF VIRUSES:

    There are currently three classes of viruses: Boot
infectors, system infectors and general executable program
infectors.  Their characteristics are:

Boot Infectors:

    Boot infectors attach themselves to sector 0 of floppy disks
and, occasionally, hard disks.  They gain control when the system
is initially booted and remain in control at all times.  Many
have the capability to trap warm boot requests (<CTRL> <ALT>
<DEL>) and remain in control even if booted from a non-infected
floppy, with the result that the clean floppy becomes instantly
infected.
    Boot infectors typically create bad disk sectors to which the
original boot sector is copied, along with the remainder of the
virus code.  Boot infectors may be from 2 to 7 sectors in length.
    Boot infectors can be benign or malignant.  The Pakistani
Brain virus, for instance, is a benign boot infector virus in its
original form.  It has been hacked however into a very malignant
form which can infect hard disks and which destroys FAT entries,
deletes files, and performs other malicious activities.

System Infectors:

    A number of viruses attach themselves to command.com and
other system files that remain memory resident.  They gain
control after system boot and infect hard disks or other bootable
floppies that contain the appropriate system files.
    System infectors may activate after a given period of time or
they may instantly begin subtle modifications in system
processing - including increasing the time to perform system
functions, subtle scrambling of data or modification of system
error messages or informational messages.  The Jerusalem
(Israeli) virus is an example of such a virus.  (The Israeli
virus is also able to act as a general .com and .exe infector as
well as being a system infector).
    Activation may take place after a specified period of time
has elapsed or after a specific number of invocations.
Activation may include scrambling the FAT, erasure of specific
files, low level disk format or modification of non-executable
files containing numeric or other ascii data.

General .COM and .EXE infectors.

    This class of virus is the most dangerous from an infection
standpoint since these viruses can spread to almost any program
in any system.  They infect in two generic ways:

1.  By gaining control each time the infected program is executed
and copying itself to other .com or .exe files on the fixed or
floppy disk prior to passing control to the host program.  This
is the most common infection technique.

2.  By remaining memory resident and infecting each program that
is loaded for execution.  This technique is used by the Jerusalem
virus but is less common than the above method.

    Some of these viruses attach themselves externally to .com or
.exe files and thus change the file size.  They may or may not
modify the creation date and time.  Others insert themselves
internally in the executable host program's dead space and are
thus "invisible" to anything other than a binary compare routine.
Some viruses continue to infect the same program multiple times
until the program becomes too large to fit into memory.  Most,
however, check to see if the host has already been infected and
pass over previously infected files.



PREVENTION TECHNIQUES:

    Prevention can be divided into two areas: 1) safe user
practices and 2) anti-viral tools.
    90% of all virus infections can be easily prevented by
following safe usage guidelines.  Most of the other 10% of
infections can be avoided by the use of anti-viral software or
hardware tools.

Safe user practices:

1. !!   NEVER BOOT FROM ANY FLOPPY OTHER THAN    !!
   !!   THE ORIGINAL WRITE PROTECTED DISKETTE    !!
   !!   FROM THE ORIGINAL DISTRIBUTION PACKAGE   !!

    The above recommendation is extremely important.  Most of the
boot sector infector viruses can ONLY infect your system if you
boot from an infected floppy diskette.  Booting from borrowed,
unknown or multiple diskettes greatly increases the opportunity
for infection.

2.  One and only one boot diskette should be assigned to each and
every floppy based PC (systems without a fixed disk), and that
diskette should be CLEARLY labeled as the boot diskette for that
system.

3.  If you have a system with a fixed disk - NEVER boot from a
floppy drive.  The only exceptions to this involve recovering
from a viral infection as described in the section below.

4.  Treat public domain and shareware software with caution.
Viruses are difficult to detect and usually do not modify the
operation of the infected program in any way prior to activation.

Thus a friend or acquaintance might in all good faith recommend a
program that is infected without their knowledge of its
infection.  If possible, limit use of such programs to systems
without fixed disks. If you do use them on fixed disks, allocate
separate subdirectories for the public domain programs.  This
will limit exposure since some viruses limit their replication
activities to the current subdirectory.  You should not place
public domain or shareware software in the root directory.

5.  Create meaningful volume labels on all fixed and floppy disks
at format time.  Develop a habit of checking volume labels each
time a DIR command is executed.  Keep a look out for changes in
the volume labels.

6.  Watch for changes in the pattern of your system's activities.

Do program loads take longer than normal?  Do disk accesses seem
excessive for simple tasks?  Do unusual error messages occur with
regularity?  Do access lights on any of the system devices turn
on when there should be no activity on that device?  Do you have
less system memory available than usual?  Do programs or files
disappear mysteriously?  Do you suddenly notice a reduction in
available disk space?  Any of these signs can be indicative of
viral infections.

7.  If you are in a corporate or multi-system environment,
minimize the exchange of executable code between systems wherever
feasible.  When using resources on someone else's PC (a laser
printer, for example), transfer the necessary data on a diskette
that contains no executable code.  Also, do not use diskettes
that are bootable or that contain system files.

8.  If operating in a network environment, do not place public
domain or shareware programs in a common file server directory
that could be accessible to any other PC on the network.

9.  If operating in a network environment, allow no-one other
than the system administrator to use the file server node.

10.  If using 3270 emulators connected to mainframe systems, keep
all 3270 emulation software together in a separate subdirectory
and do not include ANY executable code in the subdirectory that
is not part of the emulator suite.  If possible, limit such
terminals to 3270 emulation only, and remove all other software
from the disk.  3270 emulators are the major gateways through
which viruses jump from PCs to mainframes.


Anti Viral Tools:

Hardware:

    Write protect tabs go a long way toward limiting viral
spread.  All boot floppies should be write protected as a matter
of course.  For certain high security environments, you can even
purchase write protect systems for hard disks.  Some flexibility
may be lost, but the protection factor is high.
    In addition to write protection, you should consider removing
floppies from drive slots and storing them in filing cases when
they are not being actively referenced.  We have yet to hear of a
virus jumping direct from system memory to a diskette that was
not inserted.


Software:

    Software protection falls into two general categories:
programs that help prevent the virus from initially infecting
your system, and programs that help identify that your system has
been infected after the infection has occurred.  Both types of
protection have their pros and cons.


Programs that help prevent initial infection:

    These programs are TSR (terminate and stay resident) programs
that monitor system activity and watch for characteristic viral
replication activities.  They check all disk I/O and cause a
warning to be displayed when unauthorized activities are
attempted.  Such activities are:  writes to executable programs,
system device drivers, the boot sector, etc.  They typically re-
direct the operating system's interrupt vectors and thus
intercept requests from all other programs.
    This type of protection has the advantage of stopping viruses
before they enter the system, thus avoiding the difficult and
time consuming tasks associated with removing viruses.  The
disadvantage, however, is that viruses can be written to avoid
detection using this system.  Also, no software technique can
prevent initial infection from a boot sector virus.  (Another
reason to follow the above procedures to avoid boot sector
infections).

     Programs that are available that help prevent initial
infection are:

416 961 8243

C-4,  from InterPath

Flu-Shot,  from Ross Greenberg
212 889 6431

Viru-Safe,  from ComNetco
201 953 0322


Programs that Identify infections after the fact:

     First, as a note of explanation, these programs only work
if the system they are running on HAS NOT BEEN INFECTED prior to
installation.  They cannot tell you whether you system has
already been infected.  They all assume that the system is clean.
They work by looking at key information on the system disks (file
sizes, dates, checksums, etc.) and periodically re-checking this
information to see if it has changed.
    The advantage of this approach is that it is much more
difficult for viruses to avoid detection.  The disadvantage is
that the system must become infected in order to detect the
virus.  Thus the user runs the risk that the virus may activate
before it can be detected.  Activation usually implies loss of
data or entire disks.  If activation does not occur prior to
detection, the user still faces the task of removing the virus,
which, as can be seen in the following section, is a tricky task.
     The following are programs which provide this type of
protection:

Retro-V,  from InterPath
408 988 3832

Vaccinate,  from Sophco
800 922 3001



RECOVERY FROM INFECTION

    It is much more difficult to recover from an infection than
it is to initially prevent the infection.  Nevertheless, if
strict procedures are followed, recovery can be achieved with
minimum loss of data.
    The main problem in recovering from a virus is not the loss
of data (which may indeed be considerable), but the near
certainty of re-infection if the proper procedures are not
followed.  Nine out of ten installations that get infected
experience a relapse within a week of "cleaning out" the virus.
Some organizations have "eradicated" a virus as many as a dozen
times, only to have it re-occur shortly after each eradication.
    The causes of these re-appearances can be traced to two
things:

    1).  Many viruses do not go away after a warm boot.  The
         Pakistani Brain virus is a good example of such a
         virus.  In many organizations, the PC is seldom
         turned off and the prevailing assumption is that a
         <CTRL> <ALT> <DEL> will clean out system memory - an
         incorrect assumption.

    2).  Viruses initially infect fixed disk systems by way of
         a floppy diskette.  After infection, every floppy that
         has been placed in the system is also likely to be
         infected.  In large organizations, this can amount to
         thousands of infected diskettes that can re-infect
         systems if not de-activated.

    Understanding the above issues goes a long way toward a
successful recovery from a virus infection.


Recovery:

    When an infection is detected the following procedures should
be followed:

1.  Determine the extent of infection.  If the virus has not
attacked any fixed disks go to step - 12.  If the virus has
infected the boot sector only, go to addendum.

2.  Power down the infected system.

3.  Retrieve the original DOS diskette from the distribution
package.  Write protect it.  Place it in the floppy boot drive
and power up the system.

4.  Ensure that the system has booted properly.

5.  Backup all non-executable files from all directories onto
newly formatted floppy diskettes or to a tape backup unit.  If
backing up to another fixed disk, ensure that the disk has not
been infected.  (if there are any doubts, assume that it is
infected).  DO NOT USE THE BACKUP UTILITY ON THE FIXED DISK.  Use
a utility from the original package.

       NOTE -  At no point in these procedures should you execute
               ANY program from the infected fixed disk!

6.  List all batch files on the infected disk.  If any line
within any of the batch files seems unusual or unfamiliar do not
back-up.  Otherwise, include the batch files with the back-up.

7.  Perform a low level format of the infected disk.  Recover the
initial disk configuration using FDISK and FORMAT.

8.  Execute the SYS command for the fixed disk.

9.  Re-structure your directories.

10. Replace all executable programs from the original
distribution packages.

11.  Restore the files that had been backed up.

12.  Locate all floppy diskettes that may have been inserted in
the infected system within the past two years.  (We know it
sounds EXTREME, but if this and subsequent steps is not followed,
you can be guaranteed to be re-infected within a short period of
time).

13.  At your discretion either:
     A).  Destroy them all  -or-
     B).  Continue with the following steps

14.  Backup all non executable files onto newly formatted floppy
diskettes.

15.  Format the suspect diskettes.


Addendum:

    If the virus is a boot sector infector, the recovery process
is somewhat simplified.  Since boot infectors do not infect
executable programs, they can be removed by doing a SYS command
on the affected drive.  The procedures are:

1).  Power down the affected system.

2).  Boot from the original DOS write protected distribution
diskette.

3.   Perform the SYS command on all affected devices.

    The above procedures will leave the virus intact on the
additional bad sectors originally allocated by the virus, but
these viral segments will be de-activated.

It all depends on if you're under warranty or not. Desolder the battery and
your warranty is shot. Short it and you're OK. Even if the battery blows
there's a good chance your dealer won't know.

Please, people, let's just agree that shorting batteries is a last-ditch

I've just received a word of mouth report about a virus called the
gerbel virus.  The report was sketchy, but it *appears* to be a boot-
record virus.  It reportedly makes a few copies of itself and then
destroys the original (much like the Lehigh virus).  Well, when it
does its nasty work, it supposedly puts gerbel tracks (or reasonable
ASCII renditions thereof) across the bottom of the user's screen
and outputs some inane (sp?) message.  Note that this is all sketchy!
Do *NOT* necessarily trust it as being accurate.

Does anyone out there have any substantiated information on this alleged
gerbel virus?  If so, please forward it to the list.

I agree.  But since you have gone to all the trouble to desoldering the
little sucker, and since this problem COULD arise again, why not drop
a mini-SPST switch in there to prevent the desoldering mess again next
time it happens?

Radio shack has em for say $1.29....and maybe a little plastic box and
a piece of velcro to stick it to the side of the power supply...about
a total of $3-$4.....and somewhat helpful too...

Any objections? Suggestions?

bye for now but not for long...

If anyone else out there plans on using one of these "automatic answering
machine" programs, *PLEASE* advise them not to reply to VIRUS-L!  It's very
rude, and won't be tolerated.  'Nuff said.

Two points of interest.

1)  According to Ross Greenberg, the author of FluShot+, a new version
    with 'all known bugs, defeciences, problem spots, and areas of concern'
    is currently in Beta test.  It should be released next week.

2)  RE: Jim Shaffer's request for info on the Universal Virus Simulator.
    the National BBS Society (NBBS) can be reached at:
                4423 Cheeney Street
                Santa Clara, CA 95054
           Voice - (408) 727-4559      BBS - (408) 988-4004

    They have two programs.  The first is called VIRUSIM.EXE, and
    simulates every known method (except boot sector infect) of
    replication.  First run your protection software, then execute VIRUSIM.
    It will tell you which test it is running.  Hopefully, your protection
    software will 'stop it in the act.'  If not, you know which type of
    know virus replication mechanisms which you are *not* immune to.

    The second is called VIRUS-B.COM.  It is a modified version of the
    Israeli Friday the 13th virus.  The branch to the destruction mechanism
    has been removed, and it is restricted to the current subdirectory.  Also,
    It will only infect COM files, but will not infect COMMAND.COM.
    When it infects a COM file, it changes the time/date stamp, increases
    the program size by about 500 bytes, and when the infected program is
    executed, it will display a message indicating so.  Infected programs
    do themselves become viruses.

    NOTE:  Before they would allow me to download these two programs, they
           called the Senior Manager in my department to insure I was who
           I claimed to be.  Obviously, in the 'wrong hands', these two
           programs are potentially hazardous.

Another form of delayed virus execution is based on the version number.
Imagine if a virus waited until the version number of MS-DOS was 3.5 or
greater until it attacked?
