Subject: Cost of the RTM WORM  and new U.S. legislation

The Computer Security Institute newsletter (#84) quotes an estimate
from USA TODAY saying that the cost of the incident exceeds
$95 million.
 "This is based on 6200 computer affected, requiring 12 programmers at
 each site to spend 36 hours each (at $22 per hour) checking out every
 system that might have been affected, and adding in lost computer
 time (16 hours per system at $372 per hour).  However, even if this
 figure substantially overstates the case, there is no doubt that the
 true costs  were indeed in the millions of dollars."

The newsletter also provides details of the new virus law (mentioned
by Don Alvarez in Virus digest #22):
 "Congressman Wally Herger (R-California) has introduced H.R.5061, the
  'Computer Virus Eradication Act of 1988'  If passed, this bill would
  define the introduction or conscious dessemination of (i.e.
  knowingly passing along to someone else) computer viruses
  (or other harmful programs) that impact interstate or foreign
  commerce as a type of 'malicious mischief' prohibited under title
  18 of the U.S. Code.  Penalties range up to 10 years imprisonment
  and allow for recovery of damages via civil action.  To obtain a
  copy of H.R.5061, contact your local Congressional representative."

Subject: RE: locking of a PC harddisk

To Y. Radai -- regarding locking out a PC harddisk: even though the
partition table can be altered to fool DOS, a program, such as a
virus, can initiate a low level format through the disk controller,
such as implemeted through debug with g=c800:5.

in place.

It is put out by Gibson Research Corp (Box 6024, Irvine, CA 92716) and
I think my copy was about $60.  This is the Gibson that writes a
column for Inforworld.

Has anybody used this?  I confess one of the reasons I haven't run is
that it still seems tricky (although the doco is written so even I can
understand it) to mess around with low level formatting.  Any comments
from users would be appreciated.
