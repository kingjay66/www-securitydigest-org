I would feel a whole lot more at ease about the professor who wants
his students to write computer viruses if I thought the students (and
instructor, for that matter) operated within a framework similar to
the ethical guidelines and procedural restraints imposed on the
biological/medical analog.

Subject:      Terminology

        Subscribers to this list may be interested in the recent article
"Computer Viruses" by Peter J. Denning in the American Scientist, vol 76
page 236.  In particular, he discusses terminology.  Paraphrasing his
definitions:

1) Worm - a program that invades a workstation and disables it.
        <one copy per machine, RAM resident, self propagation via network>

2) Trojan horse - a program that performs some apparently useful
        function, but containing hidden code that performs an
        unwanted malicious function.
        <file resident, propagation by unwitting human beings>

3) Bacterium - a program that replicates itself wthout bound,
        thereby preempting the resources of the host system.
        <many copies per machine, RAM resident, self propagating>

4) Virus - a program that incorporates copies of itself into the
        machine code of other programs, and when those programs
        are invoked, performs a malicious function.
        <two phase life cycle - RAM form with self propagation,
                                file form with human propagation>

        Denning points out that these types often occur in combination.
A Trojan Horse is the most common means of originally introducing a
virus into a system.  For example, a Trojan Horse compiler can attach
a copy of the virus code to its output.

Defence against computer viruses comes out sounding like a message
from the Surgeon General.  Practice digital hygiene yourself.  Don't
exchange programs with anyone whose computer habits are not up to
your own standards.  Refuse to use software if the manufacturer's
seal has been broken!

        Maybe we need a "Centers for Computer Disease Control".

Subject:      my 2 cents on viruses in classes


For what it's worth, I'm sure that there are tons of pros and cons
for having a professor tell his/her students to write a virus.  I
propose, however, that it could be very worthwhile - in a controlled
environment.  Someone presented the idea of having the students
exchange programs with one another in order to allow each student
to try to stop a virus, as well as author one.  I think that this
*could* be very beneficial for the students.  The controlled environment
that I'm talking about would have to be something like a microcomputer
lab with no outside world connections (serial or otherwise), and
pcs that are either dual floppy or reloaded from tape backups frequently.
Perhaps even disallowing floppies to leave the lab...

Granted, this would be "arming" the students with the knowledge of
how to write a virus, but it would also be giving them some very
practical experience.  They'd certainly get a feel for how sticky
the situation can get when trying to stop an unknown virus.

So, with the above restrictions in mind (and possibly some others as
well), I'd say that I'm for it.

On another note, I'm working on cleaning up the VIRUS-L archives.  I'm
in the process of switching them to store messages in weekly files
since the monthly ones are getting really huge.  I'd also like to say
thanks to everyone who's sent in their comments (to me) about whether
or not I should turn the list into a moderated list.  Keep them coming!
I don't want to bias anyone's opinion on the matter since all the votes
but I will say that it's going to be very close.  Everyone has made
excellent points for both sides, and it's going to be a tough decision
to make.

I wish that supposedly knowledgeable people would quite making spur of the
moment "analogies" like this.

1) No one would knowingly DRIVE a car that had been set up for an accident.
   However, it is certainly possible to have it controlled externally.
   In fact, the so-called "crash" labs do just that ... deliberately cause
   an automobile to have an accident.  Thus, a "jimmied" car can, indeed,
   be tested.  (Incidentally, I doubt that your typical mechanical engineer
   spends ANY time learning how a car works ... they aren't auto mechanics
   you know.)

2) To learn how a car "works", one must have a real car (sure you can read
   about it, but I'll use an auto mechanic whose _worked_ on a car over
   one that's only _read_ about a car any day).  To learn how a virus "works",
   one must have a real virus.  As in the medical field, if you don't take
   proper precautions when working with a virus you'll get infected.  You
   learn the principles of creating linked lists by _writing_ programs with
   code to create a linked list ... why not something similar to learn the
   principles of a virus?

3) Cars are tangible objects which can be inspected.  If a problem occurs,
   you can see it for yourself.  Computer viruses are intangible electrical
   signals.  You may never see a problem occuring until AFTER the fact.

***Please*** take the time to think about your analogies!  One of the worst
analogies I've seen is "software piracy is like stealing a car".  Patently
false.  A car is a tangible object with a discrete value which cannot be
"copied" for the price of a floppy disk.

"Software piracy is like counterfeiting money" is a proper analogy.  [I leave
the exposition of this analogy to the reader...]

Now then ... as to the reliability of the posting to RISKS - has anyone
actually VERIFIED the information posted here as "truth"?  Disinformation
is, to my mind, as bad as any computer virus.  Incidentally, I _do_ read
the RISKS digest via USENET -- and I haven't seen that particular posting
as of this date.  Perhaps the original poster of this information will cite
the issue date of that particular RISKS digest?

Oops, I may have gotten it from the SECURITY digest.  (I always get the
two of them confused.)  ;-)  And lets say that it isn't "truth"...it still is
an interesting point to ponder.

VIRUS-L serves a purpose by being UNMODERATED., but contains incredible amounts
of gibberish.
VIRUS-L woudlld serve a different purpose if it were MODERATED
 intelligetntntly.
BUtut I suspect thtatat its audience probably likes it unmoderated.  I
 suffer along.

Ok, so disabling the hard drive is not necessarily the best answer.
I will ask the following, then: If a virus cannot squirrel its way into
any portion of the ROM of a microcomputer, is it possible to write
some sort of routine which "fools" the virus into thinking
it's busily eating away at the hard drive when in fact it
is just doing nothing, i.e. creating a virtual hard drive or hard
drive shell? Furthermore, would it also be possible to put some sort
of flag in this routine so that the user could easily detect that the
nice piece of public domain software was really a nasty infected hunk
of ferritized iron? I realize this is only good for protecting hard
drives and not much else, but it seems that the hard drive would be
a natural target for a goodly portion of all virus writers.

As to the professor who had his students write a working virus?
I agree that as long as he followed the same protocol as we
biochemists have to follow when we deal with nasty biohazards then
the entire exercise was worthwhile. This means that no disks leave
the lab, or if they do then they get wiped with Norton's WIPEDISK
or a nice strong electromagnet, and anyone not following standard
procedures gets 1) booted out of the course and 2) booted out of
the university if necessary. That's tough, but then so is some
joker taking his/her pet virus and going around destroying files.
There are risks involved in spreading knowledge like this, but
it's better to do it and learn about the virii than shy off
because things are too dangerous and learn nothing.

Personally, I'd issue a dual challenge to the students, make both a
virus and a virus hunter/detector, and let them battle it out among
each other :-).  Maybe have two rounds, with the source code from the
first round available to all on the second round.  Extra credit for
the top virus and the top virus breaker.  Now that would be fun.

The following is a message which I saw on the Usenet group comp.sys.ibm.pc,
an unmoderated IBM PC discussion forum.  It reflects the opinion (of
the author) that viruses aren't real; rather, they're the product of
marketing hype (no flames please - that's just my interpretation of
what the author says).  I, for one, can attest to the fact that they
are real, although they may not currently be as rampant as the media
might lead one to believe.  I also would not want to be in a position
of being so naive as to say that they do not exist, therefore no
precautions should be taken.   Any other opinions on the matter?

A Local MSDOS Users Group hosted a panel discussion on Viruses and the
methods to protect against them... SOPHCO and the so called Disease Control
Center were asked to participate but declined...

I for one publically doubt the existance of the virus they claim to have
discovered since SEX.EXE can be found on several BBS's in a harmless,
though tasteless form!  When confronted on the phone their rep still refused
to participate in our discussion or to produce this virus in order to
confirm it was anything other than a marketing ploy.

The panel consisted of several sysops, a security expert from Storage Tek,
a computer crime lawyer and a law professor.

Not one of these experts had ever found a bonified virus and only one
could claim to have found a trojan!  The general consensus was that while
viruses might exist their occurance was far more rare than the media
hype would indicate!

It was also agreed that much of this hype is a result of advertizing from
companies claiming to have a solution to viruses... it was even proposed
that some of these viruses might originate with such companies.

Now we all know that companies which produce and market programs to protect
users against viruses and trojans are simply doing so for our benefit and
not to serve the almighty green god so....
Everyone should do their part to support the noble effort of this Center
for Computer Disease Control by placing a little black sticky "trojan"
write protect tab on every disk and keeping their green gods in their
wallet!
