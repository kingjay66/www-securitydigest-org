     The interesting thing about the CHRISTMA EXEC was that it mailed
itself to people in your nicknames and netlog files.  Namely, people
with whom you regularly correspond.  So here at IBM, employees would
receive this exec from people they regularly corresponded with - i.e.
people they knew and trusted.  So CHRISTMA EXEC *did* come from a
trustworthy supplier!

     Even shrink-wrapped software from a multi-million dollar
corporation cannot be considered as coming from a trustworthy supplier
- - Aldus accidentally distributed FreeHand with the MacMag virus in it.

     If you mean not to run any program you can't read and understand
*even* if from a trustworthy supplier, then you've just killed the
entire software business.  How many software companies provide large
database programs in source form?  How many users could understand all
of such a beast if they did get it in source form?  Sometimes even the
people writing the software do not understand all of it.

     From the description of the remedies given by the person who
purportedly found this alleged virus, I'd have to guess that it could
be an attempt to cut down on modem traffic by making people scared to
use their modems.  I can think of several reasons why someone would
want to cut down on transfers of programs and data freely over phone
lines.

   A simple request (I hope): Would it be possible for someone to post
a listing of all known Mac and IBM viruses, what they do, and how to
treat them (i.e., what softwaPlease let me know if such a list exists or if it would be wise
for me to create one.  Thanks.
