Joe:

Regarding different viruses.  When I said the VULT virus, I
was referring to the Scores virus but scouldn't think of
the name at the time.  I also am not sure if the NASSA virus
was Scores or not.  A phone call to them got me a nasty
message that NASA didn't have a virus just a little hardware
problem that got out of hand.  (Isn't that what the spce
shuttle was?)

The Christma Virus, as well as the nude women viruses I've
seen on the Mac are just programs which print a picuture,
look for a hard disk and copy themselves to it.  I believe
the ones with the nude women pictures were actually just
programs someone wrote and someone else added the copy part.
The problem with these viruses is taht you can't really stop
a program from copying itself from disk to disk.  I hadn't
seen one which destoryed the FAT table, just ones that copy
themselves.  I hesitate to even dcall them viruses because
they really dont' do anything other than propogate, but htat
IS the definition of the virus.

The Phantom attaches itself to executables.  All the phantom
does is print a little message about the Phatntom being
some force of good and how no eveil will escape it and then
it deletes its own code.  I think its probably like the Aldus
virus, but I'm not a Mac person.

If you have a copy of a nude woman program that kills your
hard disk, I wonder if it is the same nude woman program?
]I wonder why the writer did not put them dtogether?

You refer to bacteriaum quite often.  Do you mean Trojans?
Unfortunately, when I refer to worm, its a speacial case of
a computer virus.

By the VULT virus, I presume you mean the one more commonly known as
"SCORES."  But this is the first I've heard mention of the "Phantom"
virus. I heard rumors of a NASA virus and a "Playboy" virus, but
nothing substantial. Could you please describe these, _in detail_?

I believe the Aldus virus you mention is the MacMag "Peace" virus.
Is there a different CHRISTMA-type virus out there? What does it do?

We have heard of one other virus- the "sneak."  We have no information
about it. Do you know if it really exists?

The scenario could be a mad-hacker, plugging away at a keyboard in
the back of a dimly lit office, creating a virus like no virus ever
seen before.  Viruses are going to be like methods of cheating at
cards or on your spouse.  The analogy would be having mice evolve
into a bigger species to defeat mouse traps - unless the traps are
built bigger, the mice will win.

Both viruses and bacteria are self-propagating.  The distinction is that
a virus usually does so in a restricted fashion, to avoid detection while
it does its dirty work.  A bacterium's goal in life is to propagate
rapidly without bound and thereby usurp the resources of the host system.
The CHRISTMA Virus, I believe, was really a bacterium.

Subject:      (revised) Monthly greeting from Ken


[ Last modified 29-July-88 - Ken van Wyk ]

Welcome!  This is the monthly introduction posting for VIRUS-L,
primarily for the benefit of any newcomers.  Apologies to all
subscribers who've already read this in the past (you'll only have to
see it once a month and you can, if you're quick, press the purge
key...:-).


What is VIRUS-L?

It is an electronic mail discussion forum for sharing information
about computer viruses.  Discussions should include (but not
necessarily be limited to): current events (virus sightings), virus
prevention (practical and theoretical), and virus questions/answers.
The list is non-moderated and non-digested.  That means that any
message coming in goes out immediately.  Weekly logs of submissions
are kept for those people who prefer digest format lists (see below
for details on how to get them).


What isn't VIRUS-L?

A place to spread hype about computer viruses; we already have the
Press for that.  :-)  A place to sell things, to panhandle, or to
flame other subscribers.  If anyone *REALLY* feels the need to flame
someone else for something that they may have said, then the flame
should be sent directly to that person and/or to the list moderator
(that'd be me, <LUKEN@LEHIIBM1.BITNET>).


How do I get on the mailing list?

Well, if you're reading this, chances are *real good* that you're
already on the list.  However, perhaps this document was given to you
by a friend or colleague...  So, to get onto the VIRUS-L mailing list,
send a mail message to <LISTSERV@LEHIIBM1.BITNET>.  In the body of the
message, say nothing more than SUB VIRUS-L your name.  LISTSERV is a
program which automates mailing lists such as VIRUS-L.  As long as
you're either on BITNET, or any network accessible to BITNET via
gateway, this should work.  Within a short time, you will be placed on
the mailing list, and you will get confirmation via e-mail.


How do I get OFF of the list?

If, in the unlikely event, you should happen to want to be removed from
the VIRUS-L discussion list, just send mail to
<LISTSERV@LEHIIBM1.BITNET> saying SIGNOFF VIRUS-L.  People, such as
students, whose accounts are going to be close (like over the
summer...) - PLEASE signoff of the list before you leave.  Also, be
sure to send your signoff request to the LISTSERV and not to the list
itself.  Note that the appropriate node name is LEHIIBM1, not LEHIGH;
we have a node called LEHIGH, but they are *NOT* one and the same.


How do I send a message to the list?

Just send electronic mail to <VIRUS-L@LEHIIBM1.BITNET> and it will
automatically be redistributed to everyone on the mailing list.  By
default, you will NOT receive a copy of your own letters.  If you wish
to, send mail to <LISTSERV@LEHIIBM1.BITNET> saying SET VIRUS-L REPRO


I can't submit anything to the list - what's wrong?

There have been a few cases where people found that they were unable
to send anything in to VIRUS-L even though they were registered
subscribers (only subscribers can participate).  Let me try to explain.
The LISTSERV program differentiates lowercase from UPPERCASE.  So,
if you've subscribed to the list as (for example) OPUS@BLOOM.COUNTY.EDU
and your mail is actually coming through as Opus@Bloom.County.EDU, then
the LISTSERV will think that you're not subscribed to the list.
BITNET usernames and node names are automatically uppercased by
the LISTSERV, but other network addresses are not.  If your site
(or you) should happen to make a change to, say, the system mailer
such that it changes the case of your mail, there will be problems.
If you're having problems submitting (you'll know this because
the LISTSERV will say "Not authorized to send to VIRUS-L..."), try
unsubscribing and re-subscribing.  If that doesn't work, send me
mail (LUKEN@LEHIIBM1.BITNET), and I'll try to fix things up.


What does VIRUS-L have to offer?

All submissions to VIRUS-L are stored in weekly log files which can be
downloaded by any user on (or off) the mailing list; readers who prefer
digest format lists should read only the weekly logs.  There is also a
small archive of some of the public anti-virus programs which are
currently available.  This archive, too, can be accessed by any user.
All of this is handled automatically by the LISTSERV here at Lehigh
University (<LISTSERV@LEHIIBM1.BITNET>).


How do I get files from the LISTSERV?

Well, you'll first want to know what files are available on the
LISTSERV.  To do this, send mail to <LISTSERV@LEHIIBM1.BITNET> saying
INDEX VIRUS-L.  Note that filenames/extensions are separated by a
space, and not by a period.  Once you've decided which file(s) you
want, send mail to <LISTSERV@LEHIIBM1.BITNET> saying GET filename
filetype.  For example, GET VIRUS-L LOG8804 would get the file called
VIRUS-L LOG8804 (which happens to be the monthly log of all messages
sent to VIRUS-L during April, 1988).  Note that, starting June 6, 1988,
the logs are weekly.  The new file format is VIRUS-L LOGyymmx where
yy is the year (88, 89, etc.), mm is the month, and x is the week
(A, B, etc.).  Readers who prefer digest format lists should read
the weekly logs and sign off of the list itself.  Subsequent submissions
to the list should be sent to me for forwarding.

Also available is a LISTSERV at SCFVM which contains more anti-virus
software.  This LISTSERV can be accessed in the same manner as outlined
above, with the exceptions that the address is <LISTSERV@SCFVM.BITNET>
and that the commands to use are INDEX PUBLIC and GET filename filetype
PUBLIC.


What is uuencode/uudecode, and why do I need them?

Uuencode and uudecode are two programs which convert binary files into
text (ASCII) files and back again.  This is so binary files can be
easily transferred via electronic mail.  Many of the files on this
LISTSERV are binary files which are stored in uuencoded format (the
file types will be UUE).  Both uuencode and uudecode are available from
the LISTSERV.  Uudecode is available in BASIC and in Turbo Pascal here.
Uuencode is available in Turbo Pascal.  Also, there is a very good
binary-only uuencode/uudecode package on the LISTSERV which is stored
in uuencoded format.


Why have posting guidelines?

To keep the discussions on-track with what the list is intended to be;
a vehicle for virus discussions.  This will keep the network traffic
to a minimum and, hopefully, the quality of the content of the mail to
a maximum.  No one wants to read personal flames ad nausium, or
discussions about the pros and cons of digest-format mailing lists,
etc.



What are the guidelines?

     As already stated, there will be no flames on the list.  Anyone
     sending flames to the entire list must do so knowing that he/she
     will be removed from the list immediately.

     Same goes for any commercial plugs or panhandling.

     Submissions should be directly or indirectly related to the
     subject of computer viruses.

     Responses to queries should be sent to the author of the query,
     not to the entire list.  The author should then send a summary
     of his/her responses to the list at a later date.

     "Automatic answering machine" programs (the ones which reply
     to e-mail for you when you're gone) should be set to *NOT*
     reply to VIRUS-L.  Such responses sent to the entire list
     are very rude and will be treated as such.

     When sending in a submission, try to see whether or not someone
     else may have just said the same thing.  This is particularly
     important when responding to someone else's posting (which should
     be sent to that person *anyway*).  It's very easy to get multiple
     messages saying the exact same thing.  No one wants this to
     happen.

Thank-you for your time and for your adherance to these guidelines.
Comments and suggestions, as always, are invited.  Please address them
to me, <LUKEN@LEHIIBM1.BITNET> or <LUKEN@VAX1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU>.

A "bacterium" is a program which, in addition to doing something
innocuous, creates copies of itself and spreads them. If you are on a
network, it will try to spread itself across the net. Otherwise, it
puts itself on all of the disks it can find. It does not sit around
and try to reproduce itself by hooking into the system; it only
reproduces when executed.  The CHRISTMA EXEC is a bacterium.

Let me introduce myself first... I'm the computing newsletter editor at
Michigan State University and I joined this list to learn more about virii
(which I certainly have).  Now I am in the process of thinking about dis-
seminating some of the information and have a question.

I ran across some descriptions of virus types in an InfoWorld editorial and
am wondering if they are generally accepted descriptions or something the
writer invented.  If anyone (and I'm sure many will) has opinions/facts/
ideas, please let me know.

The virus descriptions are:
GPIV -- General Purpose Infector Virus -- operates by tacking itself onto the
front or back of any existing application program, generally specific to COM or
EXE files.

SPIV -- Special Purpose Infector Virus -- designed to inhavit only one version
of one particular application program which makes it harder to detect.

VCGPIV -- Very Clever General Purpose Infector Virus -- combines the features
and capabilities of the GPIV with those of the SPIV and is able to find non-
code-bearing regions within the bodies of other application programs for which
it was not specifically designed and infect those programs; one of the
hardest to spot or control; worst variations of this virus don't begin
causing trouble until sometime after every last cadidate host application
program in the system has been infected.

CSIV -- Central System Infecting Virus -- doesn't fool around with infecting
individual application programs but attacks and alters the core of the
operating system; usually carried by a Trojan horse.

Thanks in advance for help and ideas.

Subject:      "Virus" or "Bacterium"

We had a big brouhaha around here about what names to use for what.
For practical purposes, it seems useful to distinguish between
programs that just spread themselves at the >file< level (for
instance, a FUN.EXE that copies itself, as FUN.EXE, to all the
disks it can find), and code-fragments that insert themselves
>into< already-existing executable files (as, for instance, the
Jerusalem virus does).  The biological analogies would suggest
calling the latter things "viruses", and the former things
"bacteria" (since bacteria reproduce on their own, while
viruses insert themselves into already-existing cells).

In general, bacteria are pretty easy to check for and kill
("inspect your disks for FUN.EXE, and erase it if found, without
executing it"), while viruses are much harder (it doesn't
make any sense to ask for a list of known virus-infected
programs, for instance, since *any* executable file can come
to contain a Jerusalem-type virus).

It can be very hard to draw a firm line between the two, though,
and it's not clear where the "(c) Brain" thing (for instance)
fits into this distinction...

I received a number of confusing letters over the night.
Apparently, some of you got my last letter and some didn't.
I received an error that it didn't go out, but yet I
received several replies on it.

To recap quickly, what I said was that the CHRISTMA program
for the Mac was simply an executable file.  When it is run,
it copies itself to your hard disk if it can find one, or
back to a floppy if its run on a hard disk.  Its not a
very exciting program.

The Phantom virus was sent to me from Maine, and I believe
it is a re-vamped version of the Aldus virus, although I
haven't got a copy of the Aldus virus.  The Phantom simply
will come up on your screen and say some message about
justice.  I will look back at my notes when I get home
tonight and write out the exact message.

Just to let you know, I seem to have received a threat-type
letter today.  It simply said that the PERFECT virus is
on its way.  It was a simple piece of laser printed paper
left on my car window.

I'm not sure if it was a joke or a threat.

I'm pretty sure those were made up by the Tech Talk feller especially
for that column.   I've never seen them anywhere else and, while
they helped organize the column nicely, they don't really seem
generally useful: a one-sentence description ("this virus infects
only FINOGACALC.EXE") will be much more generally understandable
than, say, "this is a SPIV".

Actually, since we are all spending so much time wishing
to view each other's viruses and anti-viral programs,
we should actually try to get this rather large group

have absolutely NO knowledge about REXX, but when it says "recipient OK",
it should get there(?).

     I hate to sound like I'm turning this into MAILER-L or REXX-L,
but............    :-)

                           JFORD1 (notice the "1") @UA1VM

P.S.  The "purge" key should come in handy to some folks.......
