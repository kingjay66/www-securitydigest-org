   Why not discuss what Morris should have to do to make good his
'prank'?  What do you think that th team'

In today's paper, I noticed that the Pentagon has set up a so called
'Swat team' to respond to security threats on their systems.  The
official name is CERT (Computer Emergency Response Team).  I was
wondering if such a team could really be that effective??  It seems to
me that the team would only act after a system had been penetrated and
some (if any) damage done.  I'm very interested as to whether such a
setup is really worth the expense.  Any responses would be greatly
appreciated.
