From:         WHMurray@DOCKMASTER.ARPA
Subject:      Presentation by F. Cohen




On  Wednesday,      July  20, 1988      at  the IBM Watson  Research
Laboratory at Hawthorne, New York, Fred Cohen gave a lecture
titled "Models of Practical Defenses  Against Viruses."  The
lecture drew well from both  within the lab and  from  among
the  members  of this forum.  I enjoyed both the content and
style  of  the       lecture.  I  was   disappointed,   but  not
surprised,  that he had  no magic to offer.  I am  sure that
others will want to report on what  Fred  said.  I  can only
report on what I heard.

He  began by repeating        his definition      of a  virus  from an
earlier  presentation in the same forum.  He  also  gave his
general purpose virus program which  contains  the line  "IF
"trigger-pulled" THEN DO "damage."

He suggested that most defenses for viruses are combinations
of the following:

*   detect by appearance
*   detect by behavior
*   detect by change

He asserts  that  detection  by  appearance is    undecidable.
Detection by behavior involves too many  false positives and
false     negatives;  it      is  disruptive.   He   asserts          that
detection of change may be costly, untimely, easy  to forge,
and at any rate, fails to deal with all attacks.

He  suggested that  ultimately we deal  with  viruses  by  a
combination of limiting sharing, limiting transivity, and by
limiting functionality and  generality.  He suggests a world
comprised, mostly, of application machines.  In such a world
we  can  enjoy      most of  the  benefits        of  computers  while
limiting  the  inherent risk.  Specifically,  he  recommends
that we limit methods of interpretation.

[Comment:  Your reporter has long promoted such a strategy [
Computers  & Security 2  (1983) 16-23,  "Computer  Security:
Observations on the  State  of the Technology," ]  To put it
another way, Von Neumann was wrong;  that is,  programs  are
not like other data, should  not  be  modifiable, and should
not   share  storage   with  modifiable  data  objects.  For
example, in  the IBM System/38          programs  are strongly typed
data  objects.      The  type,  program,   cannot be  changed.
Modifiable data  types cannot be executed.  A program may be
replaced in toto, but that results in a change in  its fully
qualified name.  This tends to make surreptitious changes to
the program difficult indeed.  This is not an assertion that
S/38 is not vulnerable to viruses, but rather an example  of
how  restricting generality can  reduce the vulnerability or
increase  the       attackers  work  factor   and  increase  his
requirement  for special knowledge.  A counter example might
be the inclusion of BASIC or REXX language interpreters in a
system,  not restricitng access  to them, while not treating
their input as executables.]

Cohen proposes a strategy which  he  calls "Complexity Based
Integrity Maintenance."  He asserts that programs must check
things    upon  which  they rely,  and  which are  subject  to
change.  This  includes their data, their own  content,  the
operating system, micro-code, hardware and physics [in order
of increasing  stability].  The check function must  be hard
to  identify,  locate,        and forge.  The  check function must
verify everything, most things, relevant things, or "however
well we can  do."  Of course, the check function  computes a
short, but difficult to reverse,  function of  the object to
be checked .

He demonstrated a  checker  called ASP  (Automatic  Software
Protection).  It  checks  the  boot  block,  OS  files,  and
dependencies.  It  detects  and  reports  all  changes.  [My
inderstanding is that it works in  a  manner similar to that
of Vaccine by FoundationWare (not to  be confused with other
programs of the same name.)]

Questions focused  on  the  windows  of vulnerability in the
demonstration       system.  Of   course,  Cohen  only  promised
defenses, not perfect security.  There  was  some suggestion
that "trusted" systems  would improve  the  effectiveness of
Cohen's  defense,  ease  its implementation, and reduce  its
cost.  Of  course this assumes          that  "trusted"  systems are
easier    to  achieve  and  cheaper   than  Cohen's  strategy;
undecidable.

Fred Cohen demonstrated both  comprehension and  wit.  I  am
satisfied  that  his description  of  the  problem  and  the
solution  is both informed  and useful.  We will  find      that
whatever strategy we adopt to deal  with viruses, if deal we
must, will have been anticipated by his work.

Not knowing much about actual MS-DOS specifics, I can present some
conjecture on the operation of the "hardware write-protect tab" you
mentioned.

In many operating systems, disk allocation tables and
directory information are kept in RAM.  After a disk write, the updated
directory info is written to the disk.  If some program disables all
write access to a disk without informing the OS, the OS is likely to
be unaware that its disk writes are failing.  The practical upshot is
that while a directory listing from the OS indicates some files have
been changed or erased, the actual contents of the disk have not been
altered.  The OS's dir is based on its belief of what is on the disk.
When the machine is rebooted, it will reload the directory info from
the disk, which will still contain the old data.

I imagine that MS-DOS keeps the hard drive directory info in RAM with
periodic updates.  Note that floppy dirs get checked all the time in
case you switched disks while the machine wasn't looking.  I still
prefer the CP/M method of dealing with floppies: if you switched the
disk, it's R/O until you type a ctrl-C.  The niceness about this is
that the OS doesn't have to look at the disk every time you ask for a
directory, it just spouts off what was there the last time.

On the other hand, there are systems that detect a loss of DTR (pin 24)
and can log out a user who tries this spoof.  We have used such systems
for some time now.  When a user tries to set up a trap like this, the
new user can only be nailed if he or she does not turn off the terminal
before logging in.

At Miami we found that PC's serving software on LAN's were resistant to
infection.  Frequently LAN software offers access features like execute only.
It would appear to be a bit more difficult to spread a virus accross a LAN
set up to serve software with no write access.  Perhaps your LAN propagation
could ammelorate your other concerns.

Rom Bios stands for Read Only Memory Basic Input Output Services.

Basically, Bios contains the routines that run all of your PC's I/O devices, inc
luding
the Monitor, and Disk Drives...

DOS also supplies functions that do many of the same things.

Greetings all,

As the virus world seems to have quieted down (at least here in the
Academic community) over the summer, I'm interested to hear what people
think will happen in the Fall and subsequent semesters as far as viruses
are concerned.  Do you think that all the publicity has enticed some
would be wrong doers into working on some super duper virus over the
summer, only to be released upon their return to college?  Or is this
too cynical an outlook?  Have we seen the end of viruses?  Perhaps all
of the potential virus writers have decided to change their ways?  A
lot of people who I've spoken with feel that a lot of virus writing
efforts are taking place this summer; I hope that they're wrong.

Opinions?

Ken

Believing all would-be virus writers have changed their ways is optimism

at the same time. Does anyone think this forum has helped/hindered the cause

The scenario could be a mad-hacker, plugging away at a keyboard in
the back of a dimly lit office, creating a virus like no virus ever
seen before.  Viruses are going to be like methods of cheating at
cards or on your spouse.  The analogy would be having mice evolve
into a bigger species to defeat mouse traps - unless the traps are
built bigger, the mice will win.

So why is there this apparently redundant duplication of services in
the IBM PC world? Is this the case with other operating systems as well?
This seems to make (as has been pointed out before by others) DOS a really
leaky way of running a safe computing environment. Mind you, how could
the deveopers know that people would conceive of viruses?

Speaking from the students point of view, I believe that if there are virus
writers working over the summer, they are not students. Several years ago,
this may have been the case. However, given the publicity that viruses have
received, it has become almost taboo among college students (at least the
sample I know). I believe college students in general lack sufficient
motivation to spend time writing a virus. There isn't any target (like a
government or rival corporation) as is the case with a small number of virii.
Also, there is a limited access to computers during summer for many students.
I believe if virii are being written, it is not by students, but by the more
educated (less responsible?) "adult" hackers with too much time on their hands.

Subject:      BIOSes and ROM BIOSes

Originally a BIOS was merely intended to abstract the hardware from the
operating system.  The BIOS would supply procedures for the operating
system that were independent of the hardware involved.  A case in point:
CP/M (again).

To have a CP/M machine, you need only supply about 30 different functions
in the BIOS.  These are primitive I/O functions such as console input,
disk seek, et alii.  The CP/M operating system itself is the same program
in all CP/M computers from Osbornes to Kaypros to Altairs.

As for the ROM aspect, it is just one way of handling the problem of
where to keep the BIOS.  Many CP/M computers keep the BIOS along with the
CP/M shell on a boot track on disk.  The whole shebang gets sucked in by
a boot program on powerup.  Others just keep the shell on disk and store
the BIOS in ROM onboard the computer.  The disadvantage of ROMing your
BIOS is that it becomes very difficult to alter it.  In my CP/M days I
found a number of hacks to my machine's BIOS that improved its perfor-
mance.  In addition, putting BIOS in ROM in a CP/M computer is of dubious
utility.  If there were any CP/M viruses, they would probably live
in the shell, not in the BIOS, which varies from machine to machine.

In the MSDOS case we have BIOSes in ROM consistently.  Many if not all
clones are designed to be hardware compatible with IBM PCs as far as is
possible.  Thus frequently the BIOSes are interchangeable.  But here my
knowledge of MSDOS is quite fuzzy.  But if clones had BIOS on disk, they
might be more susceptible to virus infection at the BIOS level.  Putting
the BIOS in ROM restricts infection to the operating system level.  I
seriously doubt IBM had this in mind when they designed it though.

Maybe someone with a good knowledge of the MSDOS details can provide
more specific information.

Happy trails,
- Jeff

In-Reply-To:  Message of Wed, 27 Jul 88 00:00:46 EDT from <OGATA@UMDD>


Jeff Ogata had a real good explanation for the ROM BIOS being the
intermediary between the operating system and the specific hardware.
In the CP/M world this was extremely important because hardware varied
from machine to machine, thus all standard CP/M programs used only the
operating system I/O facilities so that they could be sure to work
on any standard CP/M computer.  The end user need only supply his/her
terminal specific escape codes (clear screen, reverse video, etc.) to
install the program.  Then along came the IBM PC and hardware
compatability.  It didn't take long for the software developers to
realize that both the BIOS and the actual hardware *should* be the
same from machine to machine as long as it (the machine) is IBM PC
compatible.  By bypassing the MS-DOS (PC-DOS) I/O calls and going
straight to the BIOS or even the hardware, a middleman was eliminated,
and the resulting program worked a lot faster.  This practice also
weeded out the partially compatible machines rather quickly...

An anti-virus program can trap the operating system I/O calls (INT 21H)
very easily.  It's also rather easy to trap the BIOS routines in the same
manner.  It's not too simple to trap a program from working directly with
the computer's hardware (such as the hard disk controller).  And, since
the actual memory of the PC is alterable by any program (i.e., not
protected memory), it's real tough to assure that even any traps of the
operating system and BIOS remain intact.

Speak for yourself, but I feel that the worst has yet to come.  We have several
known hackers around here(banished from the system ages ago) who are probably
busily hacking away at the very such things you think college students are
beyond...In a sort of half-twisted way, I hope they succeed, it'll give us the
one final excuse the university needs to expel(sp?) them.
Plus, we are ready for them, I think.  After a terrible BRAIN attack in the
spring, our User Services and Support group mobilized, and everyone is quite
aware of viruses and the damage they can do.
Has this list been of any use??---yes, I myself know a hell of a *LOT* more
about virii than I did back in May, and I know it has helped wake up a lot of
people at both my jobs.
Thanks to all of you who have helped us separate the hype from the truth, and
what needs to/can be done about it all.

It isn't really a case of "duplication of services". One isn't supposed to
call the ROM Bios, instead you are supposed to call DOS which then calls
the ROM Bios. This serves to hide the implementation from the programer. The
advantage of this scheme is that radically different devices can be accessed
with the same logical DOS calls. The disadvantage is that it is slow...

Such a list would not help. Once you get one, you can pretty much bet that
everything else you've got has been hit, especially with the Scores virus.

No, it's not at all a dumb question. Mac viruses in general don't seem to
have been spread by Trojan programs, but by normally innocuous programs
which have become infected. The infamous infection of Aldus was supposedly
due to an infected copy of the program "Mr. Potato Head."  There have been
stories of late that infected copies of StuffIt have been uploaded (whether
maliciously or not, I can't say) to private bulletin boards.

PLEASE note that neither of these programs is a virus spreader! They are simply
victims of this plague.  I don't really know of any programs that are
specifically virus "vectors". YTou really have to be careful of everything you
get from anywhere other than the original author or an authorized distributor.
In fact, it's not a bad idea to run one of the anti-virals on those either.

If you need more information on Mac viruses and disinfection programs, order
the VIRUSREM PACKAGE from our LISTSERV here at SCFVM.  I'll be putting up a
documentation stack sometime soon (the next day or two, I hope).

I have used Apple's Rx and recommend it.  It not only looks for common
virus signatures in disk files, it will write what appears to be checksum
file for comparison at a later date. Rx does not prevent infection, it
looks for evidence of infection.

Vaccine appears to be reasonably efffective, but only if it is turned on
through the control panel.  Remember,  changes to the Vaccine control
check boxes only take effect upon reboot!  I don't use virusDective,
but it appears to work from the trivial testing I did.

I remember reading in one of Peter Norton's books that he supports
programming that makes DOS (rather than BIOS) calls because then the
program should be more compatible with TSRs, window environments, etc.
Are there a lot of programs that ask for disk writes directly (i.e. not
through DOS)?  If not, would it be possible to write a TSR that
differentiates between disk write calls from DOS (making them legal) and
those that are direct (flagging them as suspicious)?

I'm not a programmer, so forgive me if this is gibberish.

True, from a standpoint of compatability, using DOS calls is much
better than bypassing DOS via the BIOS or the hardware.  It's also
probably a better programming practice (*OPINION*).  The only disadvantage
is that the DOS calls are horrendously (sp?) slow when compared to
the BIOS or hardware calls.  For example, writing characters directly
to video memory instead of using DOS INT 21 to draw them is at least
an order of magnitude faster (!), but won't work on all machines/display
adaptors.  The end-user will probably prefer the faster program (assuming
that it runs on his/her hardware) and it will probably sell better...

>Are there a lot of programs that ask for disk writes directly (i.e. not
>through DOS)?

Not too many bypass DOS on disk activity, but *most* bypass it for screen
I/O.  Many (all?) TSRs that do disk I/O bypass the DOS interrupts because,
being a single tasking operating system, DOS is non-reentrant.  This means
that no two pieces of code can (or at least *should) use the same interrupt
at the same time; so, if program X is doing an INT 21 when a TSR does an
INT 21, program X and/or the TSR will die a horrible death.  This doesn't
hold true for all DOS functions in INT 21, but at least for many of them.

>If not, would it be possible to write a TSR that
>differentiates between disk write calls from DOS (making them legal) and
>those that are direct (flagging them as suspicious)?

DOS itself must be able to do direct BIOS and/or hardware calls.  Like I
said, it is possible to trap the DOS I/O calls, so a TSR can look out for
them, and examine them to see if they're trying to do something nasty
(e.g., write to an executable file).  As far as I know, the closest
interrupt to the hardware disk I/O level is INT 13H; it, too, can be
trapped (it is in the BIOS).  Since it is in the BIOS, however, it must
be at an absolute memory location (in order for the machine to be truly
PC compatible), so any virus should know exactly where to find it in
such a way that cannot be trapped by merely stopping disk interrupts.
Perhaps there is a way to trap actual hardware level calls that I'm not
aware of...  Any ideas?  If virus Y sees that INT 13 is being grabbed by
another program, it's the easiest thing in the world (well almost...) to
reset the interrupt pointer to point straight to the BIOS in ROM, perform
the interrupt without fear of being watched, and restore the interrupt when
done (so as not to leave any traces) and continue.

Assuming that the interrupts remain unaltered, it is possible to examine
the interrupts return address to see whether it came from DOS or from
a user program/virus.  This assumes, also, that new versions of DOS use
the same locations in memory...  Sigh...

Hope this answers your questions...  Any other comments out there?

When DOS is active, it sets a flag (in_dos). A simple TSR could trap all
ROM Bios calls and check the DOS flag. If the flag is set it could allow
the interupt and if the flag is not set it could return(error). Of
course it is easy to circumvent a scheme like this with a smart virus.

Ok, then how about having the virus attach itself (i.e., rewrite) the
COPY command?  Simple, COPY is *allowed* to alter and move files, so
just "instruct" it to append a virus.  Obviously, this flag, in-dos,
would be TRUE if COPY is doing the work...  Oh, and COPY need only be
altered in memory, not on disk (in COMMAND.COM).  Just have, say, some
game alter it a bit.

                 Potential virus Attacks at UWM

     UWM has a high probability of having its office PC's (so
called IBM compatible machines) struck with a computer virus
attack sometime soon, probably before June 1989.  If and when it
occurs, it is possible that nearly every office IBM compatible
machine will fail or lose files on the same day.  It will be a
very unpleasant time and our professional staff will be
overwhelmed by requests for help and will take some time (weeks)
to get the recovery process under way.  Most of us are unaware of
how dependent we have become on these desktop machines and how
much we will be affected by the loss of data that will ensue.

     Not only will the office machines be affected, but the home
machines that many faculty now have will also have their files
affected by the very same virus, and at the same time.  If you
are preparing a paper for publication, an exam, or some
correspondence, you may well find that your machine readable
copies of that material will become unusable both at home and at
the office.  This will be a very unpleasant experience.

     This paper discusses some evasive action that you can do now
to prepare for the return of your machine to working order.  What
I am recommending in this paper is no more than good housekeeping
and is practice that each of us should do anyhow, with or without
the threat of some mysterious computer virus.

     What I will discuss for the next few paragraphs applies to
users who have machines with either a floppy disk drive and a
hard disk drive or have two floppy disk drives on their
computers.

     Step one:  Locate the original source disks for the
           operating system you are now using on your computer.
           This may no longer be the system delivered with your
           machine, you may well have had an upgrade.  DO NOT PUT
           THESE DISKS INTO YOUR FLOPPY DRIVE YET.  Secure a few
           dozen write-lock tabs and put one on each of the
           delivery system disks.  (When you hold a disk upright
           the right side of the disk has a 1/4" square notch cut
           into the black paper jacket.  The write-lock tabs are
           black or aluminum colored gummed paper tags about 3/4"
           X 1/2" that can be stuck over the edge of the disk
           covering the front and back of this notch.  When that
           tab is in place it is not possible for the computer to
           write information onto a floppy disk.)

                Only after you have write-locked these disks
           should you put the disk into the computer and compare
           the system on that disk with the system you are using.
           STOP AND READ THE NEXT SENTENCE! The simple act of
           executing the DIR command on an unlocked disk is
           enough to infect that disk with a virus if your system
           is already infected and if the disk is not write-
           locked.  I am not kidding.  There is a very small
           probability that your system is already infected.  I
           recommend that you compare the date and size of the
           file COMMAND.COM on your original source disks and on
           your working disk or disks to see that they are the
           same.  For my system the results look like this:


              C> dir a:\command.com

               Volume in drive A is MS330PP01
               Directory of  A:\

              COMMAND  COM    25276   7-24-87  12:00a
                      1 File(s)      5120 bytes free

              C> dir c:\command.com

               Volume in drive C has no label
               Directory of  C:\

              COMMAND  COM    25276   7-24-87  12:00a
                      1 File(s)   7391232 bytes free


           Note that both copies of COMMAND.COM have the same
           date and time of creation (midnight on July 24th 1987)
           and both are the same size (25,276 bytes).  The
           numbers for your machine may well differ from mine,
           but both should be the same.  When those disks have
           been found, put them away in a safe place.  I
           recommend that they be put in a plastic storage box
           not too near your computer.

     Step two:  There are a small number of software packages
           that you would be lost without.  In my case they
           include WordStar, dBase III, PKARC, Kermit, and
           Directory Scanner.  These packages may well be
           purchased commercial software (WordStar, dBase III),
           shareware (PKARC, Directory Scanner), and freeware
           (Kermit).  In each case you should have an original
           source delivery disk for each of these packages.  Find
           those disks, WRITE LOCK THEM, compare them with the
           copies you are now using, and put them in a save
           place.  I recommend that they be put with the system
           disks discussed above.  (It is probably true that the
           creation dates for the running copies of this sort of
           software will disagree with the creation dates for the
           delivery disks.  Installation of many of these
           packages entails writing to the program.  That is not
           a problem.)

     Step three: Using the backup procedure of your choice,
           perform a backup of the system files on your computer.
           If I was using a dual floppy based system, I would
           simply make copies of my working WordStar, dBase III,
           PKARC, Kermit, and Directory Scanner disks.  If I was
           using a computer with a floppy and a hard disk, I
           would use backup-restore, or Fastback or some other
           package to back up the directories C:\WS, C:\DB3,
           C:\ARK, C:\KERMIT and C:\DS.  (Of course these
           directories have different names on your system.)
           Write lock these backup disks.  Label them with
           today's date.  Using your backup system compare the
           disks you have just backed up with the disks you are
           using to ensure that the backup "took".  Put the
           backup disks in a safe place.  This will tie up half a
           dozen disks, but with disks now costing $0.35 each,
           you will probably find the $2 investment worth while.

     Step four:  (This applies to those users who hard disk based
           computers.)  Prepare a backup procedure that will
           permit incremental backups.  This will entail backing
           up the entire system once, and then periodically
           backing up those files that have changed since the
           last backup.

           Perform such incremental backups regularly.  After
           several such incremental backups, the size of the
           backup set will become quite large.  At that time, put
           the backup set away in a safe place and begin with
           another set of disks for a full system backup followed
           by several increments.  When the second set is full,
           put them away and return to the first set.  This will
           afford a very secure set of backup files.  I find that
           50 disks makes a good backup set.  Thus 100 disks
           would be used for the double backup group.  I suspect
           that most users would need to do a full backup about 4
           to 8 times per year, requiring about 1/2 hour of
           manipulation and should do incremental backups about
           twice per week, requiring less than 5 minutes.

           (It is a very good idea to periodically test the
           backup system with a verification of what you have
           backed up.  Most file backup systems have a Verify
           command to do this sort of test.)

     Step five:  Go back to your useful work.

     Recovery from the lost of one or a few files:

     Sooner or later you will lose some files.  They will
dissapear without apparent cause and you will blame the problem
on a virus.  It is my experience that no virus is involved, the
loss of files will be due to an operator error.  If you have been
doing incremental backups, then the simplest corrective action is
to use the recover feature of the backup system that you are
using and simply restore the latest copy of the lost file(s) to
the hard disk.  If you have been consciencious then the loss of
work will entail just a few minutes or hours of rework.

     Recovery from the loss of the entire system:

     It may happen that the entire hard disk seems to be lost.
This is serious and is most likely not the result of a virus.
Most failures of the hard disk are due to hardware problems.  The
best solution is to repair the hardware if the technical people
judge that that is the problem, and then, after reformatting the
hard disk, restore the system from your latest backup.  Almost
without fail, this will result in a complete return to a normal
system.

     Really bad news, the restore does not work:

     This may well be the point of this memo.  If a virus has
been planted in your system and has been set to trigger on some
event, then the only way to recover is to rebuild the system from
scratch using the write locked set of disks that I advised you to
prepare above.  If these disks are not write locked, and if you
mount them onto an infected system, then the disks will be
infected in turn and you may well be unable to restore from a
clean, uninfected source.  On the assumption that you can build
your system again from scratch, you may restore all of the data
files from your backup set.  (A data file is one that does not
have the extension .com, .exe, or .sys.)  Any other file should
not be able to carry a virus either between systems or over the
backup process.

     Some facts:

     There is no reason ever to boot the system from a foreign
disk.

     There is no reason why a disk used to transport data between
manchines should have a copy of the files io.sys, msdos.sys,
ibmio.sys, ibmdos.sys or command.com on it.

     No system to date has been infected by the transport to it
of data files.  Only executable files can be used as trojan
horses.

   Actually it's easier than that.  All the program has to do is set up the
stack properly and do a direct jump.  Of course this assumes that the location
of the interupt in the bios and so will not work with all bios's.
I don't know of any way to trap this.

ROM bios is basically a whole slew of routines that are coded into a chip.
They provide all kinds of functions from keyboard, to screen, to disk.

BIOS calls, like the ones for the screen, tend to be faster than their
counterparts in DOS calls, but your program will only run with a system that
has ROM bios.

ROM BIOS is also usually the cause for 'incompatible compatible
computers.' - since IBM's BIOS chip is (C)opyrighted, and cannot be used by
other companies freely. Many companies have developped their own chips to
provide similar functions. I hear that the Phoenix BIOS is the most compatible,
and that the Award BIOS is another popular one..

Legitimate/Illegitimate: I dunno.. You can use BIOS to write directly to a
sector on disk, so a virus could use it to destroy something, or to write
itself onto a fresh disk.. Maybe that's what you mean by leg/illeg...

Here in Izmir, Turkey, we have a BRAIN version 9.0 on our PC lab.
We are trying to get more info on it, and trying to analize its
behavior. So far, it doesn't seem to like hard drives - we have
not been able to locate one on a hard drive.

It jumps from diskette to diskette easily, by simply writing itself
to the boot track of the new diskette. We found that the best way to
find this virus is to look at the FIRST track of the diskette. It has
a message there. We use Norton or PCTOOLS to peek at that sector.
We are also working on a program that verifies that track, and the
checksums/crc's of the three system files..

I think the computer centers/BBS's, and other similar services should
record the sources of the obtained software.. This would intimidate
the creep (the virus-writer) on distributing the virus-installing
software..

Hello Net,
  When a virus gets into command.com, it is very difficult to stop it from
spreading if it is well written.  It seems that the best way to prevent
this type of virus is to keep an eye on the dates on these files.  Then,
you would probably want a TSR to notify you whenever a DOS/BIOS call to
change the date of a file has been requested.  This would require a little
more attention of the user, but the protection scheme is simpler and fairly
reliable.
  Upon thinking, it would probably be a good idea to keep the output of the
DIR command as a disk file, so you could check from time to time, the sizes
of the files as they were and as they are now.
  Anyway, I would like to see a little discussion on a good generic technique
on preventing the infection and spread of virus, such as I have given here.

Re: Ken's request for opinions about future virus activity / and
    "warning lists" about Trojan Horses and viruses

"All the data is not yet in" for the question of future virus activity,
but here is my opinion from this vantage point....

Several trends are developing, making the situation a "good news and
bad news" one. The good news is that it looks like virus attacks on
consumer/hobbyist/small instituation computers is leveling off and
will most likely drop, with occaisionally outbreaks. One factor for this
is that the "fad" is wearing off for those who write viruses for the
"thrill". The other, more significant, reason is that many computerists
are becoming much more computer security conscious than ever before.
he number of files being transfered an many BBS's that I am on has
dropped greatly in the past six months. People are getting more careful,
slowing the spread of malicious codes.Many have started using some
form of general protective/testing software. (No, they are no absolute
garauntees, but it is step up from indiscrimate software exchange.)

The degree of complexity and sophistication to make a "successfull"
(from the perpetrator's viewpoint) virus is being driven upwards.
The bad news is the possibilty of specifically targetted virus will
increase as various people are seeing the potentials and dangers of
this electronic parallel to nanotechnology. This is a concern that the
institutions that would be possible targets are already building more
secure systems. There is possibility of "spillovers" to the general
computing community from any attempted attackes. (In the case of
targetted attacks, the result does not need to destroyed files, wrecked
boot sectors, and other obvious damage. A subtle data manipultor could
do much damage. But enough said for here.) So many institutional
computer centers are wise in constantly looking to secure their systems.

 A related factor in these trends is the matter of accountability
and other human factors. Few months ago, Vin McLennen had posted a
report in RISKS DIGEST about the various problems with employee
accountability in the computer and data management field. This seems to
intensified after the US Stock Market plunge last fall; the message
given to employees by many companies after thatwas "Produce bottom-
line profits or you're out!" (I have seen this message in some of the
advertising in computer & telecommunications publications- the appeal
to fear.) Even before the virusese, one of the biggest security
problems for a company has been disgruntled employees.

On a different subject.....
Somebody posted a request on this list for information about any
"warning lists" of Trojan Horses and viruses. The only one that I
know of is the DIRTY DOZEN listing compiled by Eric Newhouse. It is
available through LISTSERV@LEHIIBM1 as DIRTY DOZEN. Use the GET
command to get it. The latest version is 8b. Eric says that he
will coming out will version 9 soon. He will be splitting it up into
separate listings for Trojan Horses, Viruses, Pirated and Hacked
Programs, etc. The DIRTY DOZEN listings can be obtained also from
Eric's BBS - THE CREST BBS in Los Angeles, CA - (213) 471-2518.
There is also a message section on the CREST BBS for messages about
any newly discovered "bogusware".If neither routes are practical,
contact me and I can arrange for a copy (disk or printout) to be
sent to interested people by arrangement.

Not at all true; it's all too simple to alter a file without altering the
date.  *DO NOT* trust the write date as a virus detection scheme.

It's also easy to alter a file without changing the file size as well.
Particularly in the case of COMMAND.COM, the code need not even be
altered on disk at all - it need only be altered within memory, and
that can be done by any program at all since a PC's memory is totally
unprotected.  Once again, a file can contain a virus without any file
size or write date change from the original (uninfected) file.

Yes, there are many programs that write to screen. Most programs that 'pop'
into view are either writing directly to screen, or using a technique
called 'page flipping' - which is similar to turning the pages of a book.
(Prepare the next page, then flip the pages)

For an example of the difference in performance, try invoking the Norton
Utilities with the /D1 option or the /D2 option. (Which I believe are BIOS and
DOS calls with ANSI, respectively)

Trapping such calls would be difficult - you would have to check for every
memory access (there are LOTS of them), to see if they fall within a
device's area. For example, to write to screen, you simply send a byte
to a location in memory, and the character appears..

A few brief comments on recent activity on this list:

Turgut:  There are quite a few Brain variations foloating around
at this particular moment.  We have counted 7.  The original
Brain Virus ONLY effected floppy 5 1/4 inch disks.  And it did
no harm.  Versions are around that effect hard disks and 3 1/2
inch disks, but they are simply edits of the original.  Also
damaging versions exixst.  One will periodically delete files,
the c second will erase your FAST table.  (please excuse my
typeing, I have no backspace).  That should read FAT table.
I have now worked on two versions of the Brain virus and
am looking for the others.  Also, I am curious to nknow who
was the first college to dicscover the Brain.  I really
don't know who isn the US was hit first.

Gary:  Watching the Dates change means mnothing.  It is a
very simple function to keep the date from changing.  The
date change was one of the major reasons we caught the Lehigh
Virus in the first place.  If it hadn't changed, Chris, Joe
and I and Mitch probably wouldn't have realized what was
going on for a qhile after that.  Whoever wrote the Lehigh
Virus made a mistake, and I think any new viruses that crop
up will not make that same mistake.

JD:  I have been trying to compiler a list of viruses.  This
is very difficult.  I have sent mail out to just about everyone
and no one is keeping one.  We have ome across about 70 viruses
now including 4 versions of the Israeli and 7 versions of the

Virus Growth:   I expect a virus explosion of GOOD virues on
campuses next year.  A bank in upper New Jersey (who I am
not allowed to mention othe name otf) called me about 3 weeks
ago.  They were hit pretty basdly by a virus.  I honesty see
viruses increasing in hostility and in design.

The problem is that theyre is so much publicity about viruses
right now that we can't handle the problems cropping up.
Another problem I will hate to see, but it looks like it is
coming is a virus that runs on PC's and attacheds itself to
mainframes when the PC conects to them.  It will themn "worm"
its way through the mainframes.  We've been doing research on
this type of virus for a while, and a small one was located
in Harrisburg I'm told.  I cannot describe it I'm osorry to
say.  Evey time we do something, we're told to keep quite and
not fuel the scare.

About not being able to trap diredct disk writes without
trapping DOS calls.  OUr package ,... first let me say that
I am NOT trying to sell it over Bitnet, I just want to
point out that our package from Lehigh Valley Innovative
Technologies, does just that.  And it does it well.  We
do trap disk calls and check to see whether they came from
DOS or directly from the program.  And believe me, it
works, and it would be very hard for someone to mess with
it, unless they want ot disassemble all our code and try
to figure out how everything works.

One other thing:  James Bradley, your english is much mbetter
than mine, but I'm afraid there is a VERY high probablyility
of ANY college with PC sites to be hit by a virus.  Protect
yourselves NOW!

Depicting the virus writer as a gothic/romantic figure (like pirates

contributes to the problem.  If this discussion is to have any value,
any impact, it should be to paint the virus writer as he/she truly
is: an emotionally-atrophied individual, a product of negative
operant conditioning, a human who has lost contact, isolated in a
hyperspace of computer an-architecture, where techical wizardry
seems to excuse a lack of  common ethics or even common sense.

Continuing to fictionalize the virus writer as a mad scientist, a
Doctor Frankenstein whose genius gives us a secret thrill, whose
lawlessness challenges us, is just the wrong way to go.  If this
forum really exists as a deterrent to the spread of viruses, one
of its functions is the demystification of the criminal hacker.
Calling her/him a "creep" is not enough.  The consciousness in
each of us should be raised that we are contributing to the virus
writer's self-image as someone "special" whenever we present the
problem in adventurous scenerios such as that above.

Does that mean that you've counted 7 rumors, but only really
seen two different versions, or that you have good, solid
evidence of seven versions, but for some reason only have
copies of two?  I've seen two versions of the Brain virus
(both attack only floppies, and in fact the only difference
between them is in the no-op data areas), and heard rumors
of lots of others.   In every case, though, the rumors seem
to have been due to mistakes or confusions, and I wouldn't
be at all surprised if there are in fact only two versions
out in the world.   If you have hard (first-hand) evidence
of others, I think we'd all be interested.

I have good evidence for only 6 (or 7) viruses for PC-DOS
in actual circulation: the Lehigh, the Jerusalem, two
"April Fools" viruses which have already passed their
setoff dates, the Brain (and its minor variant), and a
small COM-file virus that occasionally replaces its
victim with a program to reboot the machine (rather than
simply infecting it).

Anyone who knows first-hand (or from a solid non-rumor source)
of more viruses would be doing everyone a great service by
posting a detailed description of their symptoms, so we can
all tell our users about things to watch out for.  (Loren, if
any of the seven that I mentioned above are new to you, let
me know and I can send you more details; I'd love to see that
list of 40, especially if it includes some hint of how sure
we really are that each one exists!)

All this is not to say that viruses aren't something to worry
about!   Quite the contrary.   But I do tend to think that new
rumors tend to appear MUCH faster than new viruses do...

Dave:  About rumors versus real versions, I have heard rumors
about so many versions of the Brain that it isn't funny.  Fred
Cohen described the Brain found in Mimi as a varient strain
and whent on to explain it.  It sould... sounded exactly like
the original to me.

I have heard of 7 versions from reliable sources.  Unfortunately
most people won't allow me to have copies of their viruses.
The two I have are from California and Boston.  People are so
afraid of virusses that I am ahaving difficult getting ahold
of some strains.  I have to get permission sent from the
government to these poeple fro them to release copies to me,
that is why I only have 2.  Its kind of interesting that
I travel places to help stop viruses but I can't get ahold
of some copies because people don't ... no one trust s anyone
else.

I have either copies or f or heard from reliable sources of
4 Aporil Fool's fviruses, 7 versions of the Brain, the Lehigh,
4 versions of the Israeli (there are early versions floating
around Hebrew U I'm told, bpresumably written by the culprit
who wrote the Istraeli), the Playboy, the Brain.. Gerbil I'
mean, and some minor ones (I' do not have a list in front of
me, this is from memory).  For the Mac, I've seen aa version
of the CHRISTA virus (yes, simple damn thing copies itself
around your little Mac, its not written in Rex of course),
the Phantom, the NASA virus, the Aldus virus, and the VULT
virus.  The Flushot renegade for the PC was something i
should also point out.  The CHRISTMA for the CMS machines,
a Smiley face virus which was the Chrisma redone .
4 unnamed Unix viruses and I have rumors of more floating
around.  (one of them is onely a few characters long and is
very ansty).  That is the start of a list.. oh, yeah, another
off the top of may head is a Mac virus which prints a picture
of a nude female on the screen while it copies itself to any
other disks in your system.  And obvious virus but still
a virus.  I have heard rumors of a similar virus for the PC.

The only "Playboy" thing that I've heard of reliably was just a
Trojan Horse for the Mac, not a virus for the IBM-PC or compatibles.
Similar comment applies to the corrupted flushot thing, I think;
it just did nasty things to you when you ran it, but it didn't
spread itself to other executables.   A list of Trojan Horses
would be miles long, but not really relevant to the subject matter
of VIRUS-L.   I suspect a list of real viruses would be much
much shorter.

I agree. I find virus writers just about as romantic as a sniper on the

Very interesting about command.com.  That file, as released in
msdos level 3.3 contains a 4000 byte block of zeros at its end, which
makes it VERY easy to add code.

I cannot fathom why they put that area into the process.

Virus prevention programs (those which claim to stop infection *before* it
occurs) typically intercept calls to the DOS (or BIOS) interrupt handlers.
If the interrupt request is to write to the disk, the prevention program will
notify the user.  The general impression I get is that people think that if
a program can intercept all potential avenues a virus can take to write to the
disk, it would be foolproof (or close to it).

However, a clever virus could simply check to see if the interrupt vector
is pointing to something other than the DOS/BIOS commands to write to the disk
(i.e., the vector would point to the intercepting prevention program).  If the
virus determines that the vector does not point to DOS/BIOS, it could simply
change the vector to do so, replicate itself (infect other programs), and then
change the vector pointer back to the "intercepting program".  The user would
be none the wiser.

Comments/technical corrections?

I've been using the "Master Key" utility by R.P.Gage. For a while and have
been having problems with my disk. It is a really nice utility program; it
allows you to hide,unhide,delete,and undelete files, look for matching
files , and has a hex/ascii sector editor(that's the best way I can
describe it)  I had, until recently been blowing my FATS sectors. This
caused my endless amounts of annoyance as I would get parity errors on my
disk drives, and eventually would not be able to load programs. I finally
erplaced my motherboard and these problems haven't surfaced again(yet).
 I'd like to know if anyone has had similar prioblems with this program,
or if it was, in fact, just a hardware problem.

David,

When I speak of the Playboy virus, I am referring to one of
the many things by that name.  I refere to a POC program which
was complained about slightly in Main I brelieve tha simply
copies itself from disk to disk.  It is an executable fiel
that does this.

I should not have nmentioned the Flushot thing, I know it is
a trojan.   When I talk of a certain number of viruses, I
ONLY mean viruses.  A list of trojan horses would come out
with at least several hundred.  However, I am counting
variations of viruses as viruses themselves.  In my posession
I have about 15 viruses and about 20 trojan horses, I have
a list of about 70 viruses from reliable sources.  I also
do not include viruses that peop-le wrote themselves to
annoy their co-workers.

Haggling oover the specifc number of viruses in the world,
however is rediculous.  Incdidently, I received two boot
sector viruses in the mail (physical mail) without a
return address, and they are viruses I cannot identify as
anything in particuloar.

Also, is anyone on this list from Alabama or Mississipi?

Regarding anti-viral programs, I don't think anyof them is
the answer.  I'm leaning towards hardware protections, and
have a few ideas.  We really need the hardware to be resdesigned.

There isn't anything we can do to prevent the pspread of virueses.
All we can do is make it harder and harder for one to get
around.

Neil, if you were referring to my comments arbout the program
we've written, we considered what to referred to as taking
over the interrupts, but its too shabby a job and isn't the
way we do it.  We also, of course, watch for interrupt changes.
But again this is not the answer to all our problems.

Fred Cohen demonstrated up in New York a little probgram which
basically CRC'd everything (it was a powerful check, but still
just a file check).   And I think that isn't enough either,
our program has more than just disk watches, it has the standard
CRC's for people who want to use them (one-way increyption) and
so on.

If enough people use Vaccine and the Innoculator and SDP, and
FluShot, then a virus really doesn't stand a chance of getting
too far.  The more packages out there, the harder a virus
is to propogate.  Antoher point, something Fred's program
does, Vaccine does and our does is have a random key selected
which keeps the virus vfrom being able to mimic any CRC.

The only thing we can do is make it harder and harder to
write a virus which will go through our derfenses, and limit
the number of people who CAN write one.

Fred, incidently, talked of making the nth level of difficulty
in writing a virus, in which case we are safe.  I thinkk the
world is on the right track.  Now we have to convince the
world to use the PC condoms that exist (not necessarily anyone's
ion particular).

(Heavy mail is BACK on Virus-L!)

One more thing Neil,

We're more and more referring to Anti-Viral programs as
"Virus Detection Systems" not "Virus Prevention".  The object
t is to detect the virus as early as possible.  You can't stop
that first infection (primary infection) from someone elses
system, but you may be able to stop it from infecting a
second file, or from actually doing damage to your system.

We're relagate d to fighting the symptons rather than the fi
viruses themselves.

Agreed, I didn't mean to be trying to pin you down to a specific

I guess a lot more has been going on than anyone has mentioned
here or in similar places.   I'll be eagerly awaiting your posting

I think the point about people using lots of different
anti-viral programs is a very good one; this is one field where
you don't want your own program to be the One Everyone Uses,
because if it is, the virus-writers will target it, take it
apart, and design circumventions.   Safety in Numbers!

IBM's VNET got it the worst. Most of the users there had literally hundreds
of ID's with which they had corresponded, with the result that thousands of
copies of the exec got out. They had to disconnect from BITNet for nearly
2 weeks (as I recall).

Not very. Remember, it's a self-limiting virus which burns itself out after
a one-time shot. It got into the warehouses, but there's little evidence it
actually hit the streets. Richard Brandnow's contention that he did it to
prove how much piracy was going on is an unmentionable substance found in
pastures. His claim on CompuServe was that he did because he wanted to. (Too
bad I can't type this in brimstone-spewing letters).

More information about this, please. I'm building a document about Mac

The NASA virus and the VULT virus should be the same one, known as "Scores".
Is the Phantom a new one I haven't heard of? Symptoms please. What
resources are involved?

I would appreciate your pointing me to anyone who can prove that
either the Phantom or CHRISTMA virus exists. The CHRISTA sounds
like it is a nuisance bacterium rather than a viral infection. I
need technical data -- resource names/numbers, modifications made
by the viruses, etc.

As I recall, this program shows the picture and erases your hard disk;

        A relatively effective software strategy for an anti-viral program
        is to use the timer interrupt. It is done by installing a TSR
        which implements two functions:

        1- When loaded, it intercepts the timer interrupt vector. It
           then times its own execution and stores this duration with
           a checksum. This prevents its interrupt from being preempted
           by using timing dependencies.
        2- At 18 times per second, it compares interrupt vectors for
           modifications, these are flagged and, if restricted, they are
           disabled.

        The resolution is somewhat coarse considering the number of
        machine instructions that can execute between intervals, but it
        can effectively arrest the destruction of data.

Here at the University of Maryland the (c) Brain virus was first noticed
about year and a half ago. We have several floopy based labs on campus
that are run by the business school. Data security at these labs was
not the best and eventually all the boot disks were infected. The version
of Brain we had was totally benign but a big stink was raised when the
Brain virus infected some floopies that had bad physical media. Every one
said that the Brain had mutated into a malignant virus!
Today, infections by the Brain virus are very rare on campus. We stamped
out the virus with a simple three part attack.

1. I down loaded the NOBRAIN.C program from VIRUS-L. With a fair amount
of hacking I made it work with the version of Brain we had. I distributed
the program to the Lab managers on campus, and for a while they put a
command to run the program in AUTOEXEC.BAT.

2. We had an campain to educate users on the importance of write protect
tabs.
3. And finally we stoped buying cheap disks.

I suspect that in September we will see it again, as students inadvertently
bring it back to school. With these simple precautions we should be ready
for it.

Although I have heard many rumors, I have yet to see any virus on the
University of Maryland campus that did any damage.

Perhaps they pad their software with zeroes to avoid possible shipping
damage.  :-)

A Macintosh version of Core Wars can be obtained from LISTSERV@RICE.BITNET
by sending the command (in the first line of a MAIL message)
$MAC GET DEMO-COREWARS.HQX

This will get you the BinHex-ed version of the program, along with the
documentation.  You'll need BinHex and PackIt (or UnPackIt) (or is it StuffIt;
I don't remember, sorry) to recreate the application.  If you don't have
them, ask around.  Someone local should have them.

The worst case, based on reports in RISKS TO THE PUBLIC IN THE USE OF COMPUTERS
AND OTHER AUTOMATED SYSTEMS (a.k.a. RISKS Digest) would have to be IBM's
internal network, called VNET.  It slowed it down to such an extent that
most of it had to be shut down until the program could be removed from the
mail queues.

This is a new one to me, I think.
SPAN/HEPNet had one H*ll of a case of crackers, though!  They almost made
VMS Security an oxymoron.
