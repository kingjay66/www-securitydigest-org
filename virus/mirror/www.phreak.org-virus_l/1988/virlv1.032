     I would like to remind everyone that Mir system was flawed.

[Ed. In Gene Spafford's Internet Worm report, he raises some very
interesting possibilities as to the author(s)'s identity.  The code
appears quite inconsistant, ranging from highly optimized
professionally written code (e.g., the crypt function works 9 times
faster than the BSD version") to amateurish code with multiple
(unused) global variables and subroutines that never get called.
Since Morris has not made a public statement acknowledging that he was
the (sole) author of the worm, to the best of my knowledge, is it safe
to even assume that he did (all) the work?]

But if the house would be in a mall or other high pedrestrian
district, people are bound to walk in.  This is a better analogy to
the traffic on internet.  Granted, then it would be by accident but
the house analogy isn't quite right.

In the light of the recent Internet problems (to put it lightly), I thought
that people on this list might be interested in another list which just
re-activated.

Yes, you heard it correctly; the Security list is being reactivated
after a long vacation in limbo.  The vax it was being distributed from
got sold off as a doorstop and replaced with this Sun 4/280 [an even
better personal workstation!].

material.  If you are on a unix site that receives the misc.security
newsgroup, please read the material from there and save network
bandwidth, unless you have some special requirement.  This list is
gatewayed to the newsgroup.

     Wouldn't it be in the interests of the people who SELL
anti virus software to INVENT and SPREAD viruses so that a demand
would be created for their own software?  Seems like this is
bound to happen.

    We all *should* live as we choose.  In reality, criminals deprive us
daily of things ranging from those that will never be missed to those
that are irreplaceable.  I dealt with this by providing superior safeguards
where appropriate.  I hated it.  I also hate rude "gotcha's" every bielong or are welcome.
