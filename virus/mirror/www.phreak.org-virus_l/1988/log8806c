Subject:      Another way to delay propagation (ATs and PS/2s)

In a previous message I pointed out that Macintosh PRAMs could be used to hold
a counter to implement a delay mechanism for a virus.

This technique could also be used on ATs and PS/2's (and clones therof) since
they also have configuration RAM, or whatever IBM calls it this week. This
method would not rely on the ability to write to disks.

(One more nasty thought from the source of the great Mac battery wars... :-)

So far this distribution list seems to have
concentrated on micros - are there any instances
of virus attacks on mainframes/minis/supermicros
(ie multi-user machines bigger than PC-AT's)

It strikes me that since so many of these machines
(especially in the academic community) are networked
there is definitely a distribution medium for
virii. The only incidents I've heard of have all
required huming beans to help "propogate" (?)
the virus from one machine to another (XMAS EXEC?)

Subject:      NYPC meeting summary


Last night (June 14, 1988...), I attended an invitation-only meeting
of the New York PC users' group.  Among the attendees were several
representatives from some of the major corporations in the NYC area
as well as a few anti-virus program vendors, and myself.  The
people from the corporations wanted to get some facts about viruses
without any media hype.  The meeting was set up as a forum discussion,
and touched on most of the major points in current virus technology and
jargon.  Basically, the vendors (and myself) described what known viruses
do (by citing several examples) and answered several questions presented
by the corporations.  Among the questions were "What is the difference
between a virus and a trojan horse?", "Can a virus do hardware damage
to my PCs?", etc.  Hopefully, some common misconceptions were cleared
up.  Each of the vendors then got a chance to discuss and demonstrate
their wares.

That brings me to my next topic (finally :-).  I'd like to hear from
people who've used commercial (and non-commercial) anti-virus packages.
Hopefully, we can generate some objective discussions on the various
packages here on VIRUS-L.  Any takers?  Some of the currently available
packages are, in no particular order:  (a thousand pardons to any
which I neglect!)

Data Physician
Flu Shot
Disk Watcher
Vaccine (there are a number of products under this name!)
Vaccinate
Checkup
Disk Defender
Panda
...the list goes on

So, let's hear from people who've used these (or others).

Much (if not all?) of Fred Cohen's Phd work was done on minis and
mainframes.  Indeed, the possibilities here seem to be even more
limitless than those on micros.  Particularly with things like
international networks to aid in the distribution of a virus.

  This isn't only true of larger machines.  The micros also needed a
  'huming bean' to search out and obtain the infected boot disk.
  XMAS EXEC was different only because it is unusual in the mainframe
  world to just run a strange program you picked up on the network
  (unlike the PC world, where such things are not only run, they are
  booted from).  XMAS EXEC required not just a 'huming bean' but a
  gullible one, and not just one but many.  What was truly amazing
  was how many it found.  Perhaps if they'd been thinking instead of
  huming the damage would have been smaller. :-)

Subject:      mainframe virii

Here at Bucknell University, rumors abound about a virus called TAPEWORM
that was allegedly run on one of our mainframes some years ago. Unforunately,
all the rumors are so vague that I can't even determine what OS it was running
on. As for a time frame, I would have to say probably within the past 5 years.
The virus supposedly singled out individual users accounts at random when
they logged in (how it was supposed to do this I have no idea) and copied
itself to them. The users couldn't erase it, and each time they logged in
after the initial infection all of the copies of TAPEWORM in their account
generated one new copy, so the population grew exponentially until soon the
user's disk quota was exceeded.

Has anyone heard of this, or is it just a wild story that got started somehow?
(Of course, even if it did happen here it doesn't mean that it happened
elsewhere. We've never been a part of any DECnet, UUCP, or any TCP network,
so spreading it would have been difficult.)

--Jim Shaffer, Jr. (shafferj@bknlvms)

P.S.  According to the stories, the last person to ever see our virus graduated
      in 1987, so nobody knows if it's still around or who started it. The
      computing center staff refuses to give out any information that's even
      remotely security-related, so I've never asked them. They get suspicious
      if people start inquiring into possible system bugs. I know this from
      experience.

Tell me about XMAS EXEC; I've never heard of it.

One possible infection mode I've seen for VM/370 mainframes is an
EXEC I've seen that spools two punch files together to some user.
Only the first file appears in the header information, and there
is only one spool file.  The result is that a user can transmit an
innocuous file to another person with some other file tacked on the
end.  When the innocuous file is received, the other file is
received also.  Don't ask me how it works; I just know it works --
I've seen it in action.  In every way I was able to determine, there
appeared to be only one file, yet when I received that file, it
wrote two files to my disk.  It only notified me of the first file.
This EXEC could easily be used to infect other mainframes with
viruses -- send something like XEDIT EXEC on the back of some other
file; the next time the victim XEDITs something, the virus is acti-
vated.  Unless the victim examines his disk everytime he receives a
file, he probably won't notice.

There is a curious virus said to exist in the C compiler AT&T uses
at their research locations.  This virus was added by a compiler
hacker some time ago, and performs the simple function of printing
a happy birthday message for that hacker every time the compiler is
run on his birthday.  This virus is particularly curious because it
is virtually impossible to find where in the C compiler it is located.
This was done by taking advantage of the fact that the C compiler is
used to compile itself every time it is updated.  For example,
suppose you write a piece of code that can reproduce itself (typical
self-printing program).  This code performs the following function:
if you see some piece of code in the C compiler, print yourself along
with a replacement for that code, and code to print out a happy birth-
day message on my birthday.  This code is triggered at one particular
place in the C compiler code.  Whenever that code is scanned, it is
replaced by all the virus code.  The trigger code can be completely
innocuous; it need only be in a place where code can filter the
scanner output.  Now as soon as the C compiler has compiled the new
version of itself, the virus code can be removed from the source code.
Each time the compiler is run on itself it will insert the virus code
at some point.  But the virus code is only alive in the executable
version, not in the source code.  According to legend, to this day
no one has discovered where the trigger code is, nor has anyone been
able to disable the virus.  This is the way I've heard it.

Well, he's got a point.  Once someone's got a taste of the havoc they can

I'm not sure how this works, but look at sendfile with the acknowledge
option.  When a receive is performed, a file 'Acknowl dgement' is
sent back to the host.  Therefore my bet is that it has something
to do with the 'netdata' format.

Subject:      Academic Assignment of Viruses

A society that depends upon any mechanism for its own proper
functioning,  cannot  tolerate,  much  less  encourage,  any
tampering with the intended operation of that mechanism.

Therefore, one is tempted to rise up  in indignation  at the
idea  of  a  qualified academic  assigning a  virus  to  his
students.  The next thing you know, they  will    be assigning
plagiarism.  How about the forgery of  academic credentials?
Perhaps we  should offer a course in how to falsify research
results.   Or,      perhaps,   on       how   to   trash   another's
experiments, notes or reports.

Perhaps  it is a sign of immaturity  that  we are  unable to
recognize  the moral  equivalency.  I  will  leave open  the
question of whether the immaturity is in the technology, the
society, or academia.

I thought that      we put this  issue to bed several  years ago
when  we  stopped assigning  the  breaking  of security.  It
seems that we did not.

For an academic to be unable to  recognize that assignments,
and  the   recognition        that  goes  with  their   successful
completion, encourages the behavior assigned, demonstrates a
lack  of  understanding  of  the activity  in  which  he  is
engaged.  If  he understands it,  and  still makes  such  an
assignment, he demonstrates a lack of understanding of where
his real interest rests.

Such irresponsible  behavior  may account,  in part, for the
anti-academic  bias  in our  society  and for  the  manifest
distrust of the  scientific establishment.  It    is of little
wonder that the citizens  of  Cambridge,  Massachusetts  are
reluctant   to      trust     the  likes  of      these  with  genetic
engineering.

If there is any lesson that  we should have learned from the
computer, it  is  that understanding the effects  of what we
intend for it to do is        a daunting task.  Even getting it to
do what we  intend is  not  trivial.  It  seems  to me, that
there is  plenty of material here for assignments;  we      need
not look  to assignments which          are at best trivial, and  at
worst, dangerous.

Naturally after I send the message out I remember how to look at
a file to see if there are more than one file.  Get the number of
records off the 'q rdr all' command, then do a 'PEEK X (FOR Y' where
'X' is the spoolid, and 'Y' is the number of records minus 1.  You'll
see all kinds of funky stuff there, which is the NETDATA format.

 WorldWide Data's VACCINE is one of the many "anti-viral" software packages
on the market now. These programs offer to guard computers from malicious
computer programs, known as "Trojan Horses" and "viruses". Many of these
programs emphasize the parallels between computer "viruses" and biological
viruses. VACCINE is no exception; its very name has a medical connotation. Its
packaging displays pictures of hypodermics, forceps, Kelly clamps, and other
medical instruments. The medical analogy was so strong, I felt I had to
sterilize my hands before loading the program into the XT.

 The VACCINE package includes one 5.25" diskette, a nine-page instruction
book, registration card, and a couple of information sheets. The diskette
itself included three main programs- VACCINE, ANTIDOTE, and CHECKUP. The are
several utility and sample files files included, as well as a README file for
additional documentation. The instructions were clear, concise, and simple.

 ANTIDOTE, which is the first program to be run when installing VACCINE,
scans executable files on one's hard disk, looking for signs of program code
to any of the various "viruses" known to WorldWide Data. ANTIDOTE can run
periodically to check for suspicious code.

 CHECKUP examines the executable files on one's hard drive, derives checksums,
checks the files' sizes, and compares the information against a file of values
from an earlier CHECKUP run. If the file of previous values doesn't exist,
CHECKUP will create a new one. It will give a status report telling one which
files have been changed, deleted, or added.

 VACCINE is a memory-resident program which detects programs that change
memory tables or they to become memory-resident. To prevent continual false
alarms when running legitimate programs, one must prepare a configuration file
which lists the names of legitimate program which may trigger off VACCINE's
warnings. This is quite simple. The documentation suggests that VACCINE be
invoked by the AUTOEXEC.BAT so that it is always in the background. When it
detects a program attempting to change the memory tables or become memory-
resident, VACCINE sounds off rapid pulsing tones and flashes a warning at the
bottom of the screen. It gives one three options- "Y" to continue the program,
"R" to reboot the system, or "A, Alt-A, or Control-A" to add the detected
program's name to the configuration file.  Simple enough. The option to update
the configuration file is excellent; the update can be done with one
keystroke.

 As mentioned several times above, VACCINE is simple to install and to use.
But a major question remains- "how effective is it against destructive
programs?". Since I don't have samples of "virus" program, I could not run a
full "live ammo" test. Yet from examining and using the package, I have found
several indicators of its capabilities and weaknesses.

 The package does a good overall checkup of the EXECUTABLE FILES. This will
detect most of the "viruses" which infect executable files. VACCINE will not
detect anything that infects other files, such as overlay files. For moment,
most of the "viruses" that I have heard about would be detected by VACCINE
since they, at some point, will affect executable files. There are no such
assurances for the future. A major precaution that must be taken with this
software was with any other "anti-virus" software- one's system must be
"clean" before installing the software. Otherwise, the software may consider
the destructive software as a part of the normal environment. This is why the
VACCINE documention specifies that one uses ANTIDOTE first. But if ANTIDOTE
misses bogus code, it may be a while before CHECKUP of VACCINE detect the
code.

 While running CHECKUP several times, I have noticed a quirk that can cause
problems for some users. I use a subdirectory with a high-order ASCII
character in its name. The first time I ran CHECKUP, it worked well since it
was creating a new checksum/size file. But when I ran CHECKUP again, it gave
me an error message, saying that the program found an invalid character in the
checksum/size file. After experimenting with renaming of the unusual
subdirectory, my suspicions were confirmed. CHECKUP can be thrown off by high-
order ASCII (ASCII 128-255) in filenames or directory names. This quirk makes
it impossible to effectively use CHECKUP on the whole hard disk or on the root
directory; CHECKUP can still used with subdirectories that don't have the
high-order ASCII codes. This should be no problem for most users, but some
users should be aware of this quirk. I know no solution to this quirk other
than changing the filenames or directory names.

  VACCINE was simple to install and to use. It seems to offer a good amount
of protection against the most of the common types of malicious programs. But
will only scan executable files, so other files are still vulnerable. Then
there is the matter of CHECKUP's quirk regarding non-standard filenames. Then
considering the price of VACCINE ($79.00), I would recommend for the average
home PC user to check out some of the other "anti-virus" software before
deciding which one to buy. Some have options that VACCINE does not and many
offer a bit more for less cost. VACCINE will definitely do the job of
providing some protection for one's system. But there is no 100% effective
"anti-virus" program. So whatever software, one uses, one must still compute
wisely.

Vaccine for the Macintosh

Author: Don Brown, CE Software

Price: Free

Type of program: Virus blocker (INIT file)

Installation: Copy file into System folder

Action: Vaccine blocks attempts to write code resources of various types
        (including FKEYs, MDEFs, WDEFS, and INITs) and displays a modal
        dialog alerting the user as to the attempt. The user may choose to
        allow or disallow the access. Vaccine has an "expert mode" which places
        a tiny icon in the upper right-hand corner of the screen which can be
        clicked to allow or disallow the access.

        Some users have reported trouble with the Font/DA Mover and Vaccine,
        but I have not had any problems. Vaccine is quiet, unobtrusive, and
        should stop any virus which does not completely avoid using the
        Toolbox to modify the resource fork of files.

Re: Ken van Wyk's request for people who use anti-virus software:

I use several programs as part of a general plan to protect myself.
I recognize that this plan isn't perfect, but what else can one do?

I run Data Physician's DATAMD program, which checks pre-tagged .exe and
.com files upon each boot-up.  I used to run a similar program they sell,
which does the same thing at user-specified intervals automatically while
my AT is on.  So far the software has not detected viral attack against
these file.  It has detected changes when I've modified the files, so I know
the detection system is active.

When I get new .com or .exe files, especially binaries off the net or from
bulletin boards, I run CHK4BOMB on each one to look for ascii text that
suggests the possibility of a Trojan, as well as to see if the program might
generate disk write activity.

I then use Data Physician's DISKLOCK program that isolates my hard disk
from the floppies.  I switch to a floppy and execute the program a specified
number of times.  On the floppy is a copy of Sophco's CANARY program that
tells you if it's been infected by a virus.  If that passes, I then change
the system date and run the program several more times.  If everything
checks out, I presume that the program is safe and proceed to use it.

Granted, none of this is fail-safe, yet I feel some responsibility to check
this stuff, especially since I usually end up passing it out to interested
users here at the University.  If I can get source code, we often regenerate
the binaries from that.  Hope this might be of interest....

Within the last year there was a major infection of .BITNET
by the program XMAS EXEC.  Since most .BITNET nodes are
running VM/CMS, it was able to take advantage of a common
environment.  It required the gullibility of the receiving
user to propagate.  Once run, it displayed a Christmas Tree
(as promised) on the screen, but then proceeded to redistribute
(SENDFILE) itself to every user in ones NAMES file (the CMS
equivalent of a Rolodex).  I read one message that said it
also consulted your NETLOG for prospective destinations.
An international effort commenced to eradicate the virus and
to identify the originator.  The last word was the user was
identified and stripped of his network access privileges.
Supposedly large portions of .BITNET were overloaded by
this virus, and had to be temporarily disconnected.

I have had a limited experience with an early version of
FLUSHOT.  I downloaded it to my PC and installed it as
instructed.  I then proceeded to use my favorite software.
I quickly realized that this program was being over-protective.
I could not get any normal work done because of the incessant
interrupts.  I suppose it would be useful when you are trying
out a new program.  Since it prevented many correct programs
from working, I doubt it could identify a rogue.  Remember,
this was an early version.  I do not know what improvements
have been made since then, but with the dopplegangers on
the market, I am afraid to pursue it any further.

Subject:      WordPerfect virus (?) and Brain

    Hello Virus Fighters,

    Recently we have been having some problems with WordPerfect, which
    is the Word Processor installed in the computer labs of the
    Wharton School.  One of our people sent out a message which
    briefly described the problem as she saw it. The message is at the
    bottom, below my notes.

    Note that sometimes the floppy disks of those people who are
    bitten by this virus have a volume name "(C) Brain".  We know that
    Brain is "supposed" to be a malign virus, but every time we have
    examined the code written by Brain to the floppy to propogate
    itself, it looks pretty harmless, and when we boot on a Brain
    diskette it doesn't progressively chomp up the disk with bad
    sectors.  It looks like it alters the boot sector and makes a copy
    of itself in another sector which it marks as bad, then stops,
    awakening only to copy itself to a new disk (the Brain we have
    been able to isolate can't propogate itself on a HP Vectra, which
    is our most common PC clone).  This particular Brain cannot infect
    hard disks (at least on a HP Vectra), it only gets DS/DD floppies,
    and the only way it gets in our labs is by people coming in and
    running an infected program off their own floppy.

    One of the problems with identifying this virus (we've been
    calling it the Error 31 Virus) is that any time it strikes,
    demolishing the FAT, the computer (in our labs HP Vectras) hangs
    up and won't respond to any keyboard commands. When the computer
    is restarted all signs of the virus executable are gone. While
    this is an excellent prophylactic measure against infection, the
    users of our lab do not turn computers off and on before they
    start working on them, instead they gravitate to the computers
    that are already on.

Actually it has nothing to do with acknowledge or Netdata format.  It
uses disk dump format through your virtual punch.  It first spools
your punch continuous, then disk dumps various files to it and closes
the punch file.  The only file that shows up to RDRLIST or Q RDR is the
first disk dump.  It IS possible to check whether the number of lines
in the file matches with what a Q RDR says, but how many people do that?

In-Reply-To:  Message of 15 Jun 88 10:02 EDT from O'Brien


It is true that most of the network viruses have depended on duping the
target into executing the virus.  The XMASCARD EXEC simply demonstrates
how easy that is to do.  The demonstration is even more powerful because
many of the victims of that virus have been specifically warned not to
execute unsolicited programs.  They have even been specifically warned
about Christmas greetings.

VM, Unix, Multics and VMS are particularly vulnerable because they
employ the same name space for programs and data.  VM and Multics are
slightly less vulnerable to the extent that executables do have specific
file types.

However, one should always be careful regardless of the name or type.
In his Turing Award paper, Ken Thompson demonstrates that one man's data
is another man's program.  Both Thompson and Cohen point out conditions
under which application data can be employed as the vector to distribute
a virus.

A problem for any virus designer is to get his code executed.  The PC
viruses have demonstrated a number of solutions to this problem.  It
would not be appropriate to discuss any further solutions to that
problem here.  Suffice it to say that good computer hygiene requires
that you not accept any unsolicited mail and be careful even with data
from known sources.  Note that the XMASCARD appeared to come from a
friend.

Good hygiene also requires that you not execute untrusted code while
connected to the environment.  VM offers a solution to this problem;
that is to run VM under VM.  In this event you will own all of the
products of the execution, since you own the virtual punch/network.  Of
course this assumes that you have access to a copy of VN/CP and
sufficient resource to execute it.

As I have pointed out before, although the author of a virus can predict
how it will behave in the target execution environment, he cannot
predict very well how it will behave in a population.  If you introduce
a virus into the population of which you are a member, then you will
likely be one of its victims.  Since you cannot predict how it will
behave in the population, you can still be the victim even if you
yourself are immune.  Note that the author of the XAMSCARD was immune
since he would recognize it and not be duped.  However, he was still a
victim of the saturated net.

Note that the XMASCARD was benign in the execution environment.
However, in the net, it was far more destructive than the author himself
could have expected or predicted.

I can conceive of the circumstances under which I might.  But the author
of such an assignment has a much more difficult problem.  He must trust
fifteen or so people, all of whom have the pride of authorship that he
has given them, never to let their creation out of the sterile
environment.  That is a much less sanguine situation.  I might be
willing to trust three people who were mature and informed, but to trust
fifteen, at least some of whom are young, and about whom I can have at
best a limited knowledge would be at least risky.  Given the destructive
potential of a virus, it is clearly unprofessional.

The XMASCARD EXEC was reported in the Wall Street Journal and has been
dicussed in this forum and in RISKS.  It originated in BITNET where it
was fairly benign, but passed into VNET via a gateway.  When executed it
displayed a greeting to the user and sent a copy of itself to everyone
in the user's maillog and NAMES file.  In VNET, where the number of
users known to the typical user is numbered in the high tens to low
hundreds, the number of copies created saturated the net.

As to the exposure that you raise, it relates to DISKDUMP rather than to
PUNCH.  It has been fixed.  The fix is very expensive.

Receiving multiple files with receive, where you only see one file
in your reader is common practice within VM/CMS. Those files are
generated with DISK DUMP with continous spooling of the punch. There is even
a warning in the DISK DUMP help text about this. Even worse is that
Receive only warns you if the visible file is already on your disk.
The other (invisible) files are overwritten on existing files without
any notice.
I once got a PROFILE EXEC from somebody in this way without noticing.
The next time I logged in again it was executed. I was lucky that it
was not harmfull.
I know that there are programs around on some Listservs which can
signal this kind of readerfiles.

  Indeed this is (at least was) true.  You can DISK DUMP two files
  together in a documented way, and only the first one will be
  announced in the header.  The rest are only announced in the body
  itself.  As I recall, if you DISK LOAD them back, you do get the
  list.  This feature of DISK is actually useful, since it allows
  you to package up and send large collections of CMS files in one
  spool file.

  However, the RECEIVE command, as part of being 'user friendly',
  suppresses all output from the underlying functions it calls, and
  then you don't know if files have been overwritten.  Don't know if
  this has been fixed in the mean time. I always used to DISK LOAD
  to an empty disk just to be safe.

  More to the point, it is possible to find out what sort of reader
  file you have in your reader, and handle DISK DUMP files more
  carefully.  I think the ipf RDR command will tell you this (but I
  don't remember the details).

Hi folks,

in his message from 06/15/88 O'Brien mentioned the topic of mainframe
viruses. He writes that nothing is known about infections of mainframes
or mainframe viruses itself. Thats not correct.

Fred Cohen started his experiments with computer viruses on mainframes.
The first virus was written for a VAX 11/750 system running UNIX (Ultrix?).
The following experiments were carried out on a UNIVAC 1108 (running a Bell-
LaPadula system), on a Tops-20, on a VAX running VMS and on a VM/370 system.
So you can see that the first viruses were mainframe viruses and *NOT*
PC-based viruses.

But it seems to me that Fred Cohen was not the first one to implement self-
reproducing code on a computer. I want to mention the work of J.Kraus from
the University of Dortmund 1980/81 (3 years before Cohen). The title of the
paper was "Selbstreproduzierende Software (self-reproducing software)". He
gives a very complete theoretical background of selfreproducing software
and some examples of such code in a real assembler language (SIEMENS
assembler language; the same assembler language as the IBM/370 system but
with a different operating system - but also a mainframe). Interesting note:
You cant get the orignal work from 1980 but just a modified (and I think
"moderate") version from 1981. Someone wants to keep things secret. :-(

I wrote a replacing virus for a IBM 30xx running MVS/370 a year ago.
Its about 600 lines long. Because my account on that machine is restriced
to "harmless" applications after the system manager realized what I am
working on, I was not able to improve the virus...

What about "non-academic" virus infections on mainframes? I never heared
of any case that was verified to be a virus infection. But there are some
rumors about that. The first one I knew is related to the events in Berlin,
January 1986. On Jan. 23,1986 some students at TU (technical university)
Berlin announced a strike for better payment. These students are employed
by the university to support younger students in their studies at the
department of computer science. So the striking students are very knowledge-
able of the IBM 4381 running VM. What happend? On Jan.31,1986 the mainframe

performance was bad as never before. It was impossible to use the computer.
The system managers noticed that many parts of the operating system and most
application programs spend a lot of time to increase a counter and then to
decrease the counter again before they start their normal execution. This
"increase/decrease of useless counters" increases with time so some people
expected to find a virus. Did they found one? I dont know. The mainframe
was disconnected from all networks for 14 (!!) days and everything was
analysed by computer stuff from IBM and the university. They "solved" the
problem by generating a very new system and to "erase" all application
programs. So if you want to know more about it I think you have to ask the
TU Berlin, Department of Computer Science or IBM....
There are two or three more rumors about virus on mainframes but much less
is known about the circumstances so I dont want to mention them here.

All the best to you all,
Bernd.

Reviews of Virus Protection Programs
Please feel free to add to this list.
Version 1, 6/15/88, T. Shapin
===============================================================
Class 1 are programs that warn of changes to system files after the fact.
These methods either compute some sort of CRC or hash sum, or compare a
file against a copy of the file.  While it is theoretically possible
for a particular CRC to be forged, each program seems to use a different
algorithm for the computation so that different values are obtained.
Furthermore, each version of DOS will give a different values, so I
doubt that the signature can be forged practically.
===============================================================
CHKSUM.ARC, contains: CHKSUM.C, CHKSUM.DOC, CHKSUM.EXE, CRC16.C, STOI.C.
From: Bob Taylor, compiled using Turbo C 1.5.
What it does: Computes a redundancy check (CRC) for any file, (including
system and hidden), and compares a computed CRC for a file with a specified
one given as a parameter to the program. Wildcard file names and more than one
filename can be supplied as parameters. Either gives a warning message or
optionally sets a return code. On a vanilla 4.77 Mhz PC, it takes about 7
seconds to check all three system files.
Evaluation:  Fast and very useful. [T.S.]
- - - -
CHECK-OS.ARC, contains: CHECK-OS.DOC, CHECK-OS.EXE, CHECK-OS.PAS.
From: R.J. Bartlett & Erik Ch. Ohrnberger
Compiled with Turbo Pascal version 4.0.
What it does: It checks the Filesize, File Date/Time (last updated), and
Checksum of COMMAND.COM, AUTOEXEC.BAT, and CONFIG.SYS. Will also check
system files.
Evaluation: On my system it would not handle the "FCBS=" parameter in
my CONFIG.SYS file. It needs some work. [T.S.]
- - - -
CHKUP14.ARC, contains: CHECKUP.DOC, CHECKUP.EXE, REGISTER.DOC.
From: Richard B. Levin. BBS's:  (215) 969-8379 or (215) 635-5226
Compiled Microsoft BASIC v.6.0
What it does: Compares a target file's size, its incremental checksum, and its
total checksum.
Evaluation: While the method of computing hash sums would be difficult to
forge, it prints lots of messages when it runs, and there is no provision for
returning error codes that can be tested in a batch file. I find the
the lack of source code a minus and the appeals for money obnoxious. [T.S]
- - - -
CONDOM.ARC, contains: CONDOM.BAT, CONDOM.DOC, CPY.C, CPY.EXE,
DIF.C, DIF.EXE, READ-ME.NOW.
From:
 Charlie Ros5e [sic], Boulder, Colorado, BBS Fido Node 104/23, Account Name:
Charlie Rose; and Gerry Williams, Albuquerque, New Mexico, BBS Fido Node
15/1001.
DIF.C and CPY.C, were compiled with Aztec C86, Version 3.40b, Manx Software
Systems.
What it does:
CPY makes a reference copy of any file, including system, or hidden. DIF
compares a current file to the reference copy and sets an error return code
that can be tested in a batch file that indicates what happened.
Evaluation: Very useful for checking system files for any changes. [T.S.]
- - - -
FILECRC.ARC, contains: COMPARE.CHN, COMPARE.COM, COMPARE.PAS,
FILECRC.COM, FILECRC.DOC and FILECRC.PAS.
From: Ted H. Emigh, Department of Genetics, North Carolina State University
Box 7614, Raleigh, NC   27695-7614, emigh@ncsugn.uucp, NEMIGH@TUCC.BITNET.
Compiled with Turbo Pascal 3.0.
What it does:
FILECRC creates a list of all the files on the default drive along with
creation date, file size, and a CRC (cyclic redundancy check) for each file.
When FILECRC is run again the new list is compared with the old list.
Evaluation: I tried it on two systems and it didn't work.  They
both hung and I had to reboot. [T.S]
- - -
SYSCHK1.ARC contains SYSCHK.EXE and SYSCHK.DOC.
From: Terratech, 19817 61st Ave. S.E., Snohomish, WA 98290
What it does:
Performs checksums of the first and second files in the root directory
and the COMSPEC file.  These are the three system files.  The first time
the checksums are displayed.  If they are given as parameters, they are
compared against the current values. Error levels are set so a batch file
can test the results.
Evaluation: Works well.  This is shareware, with donation information only
given if you request it with "SYSCHK /?". [T.S.]
- - - -
VACCINE.ARC, contains VACCINE.EXE, VACCINE.DOC.
From: BBS (616)361-7500
What it does:
A compiled BASIC program that will give the size, time and date of a
supllied file name. If these are given as parameters, it will compare the
current values with the parameters and print a message that they
agree or disagree.  It will not read files with the system attribute.
Evaluation: Probably not very useful. [T.S.]
- - - -
VIRUSCK.ARC contains: LICENSE, README, VIRUSCK.DOC, VIRUSCK.EXE.
From: Matt Cohen, PO Box 10589, State College, PA 16805-0589
Written in Turbo or Microsoft C
Source code: 83 lines
What it does:
It runs a program and reports any changes in its size or date
after it is executed.
Evaluation: Not recommended. [T.S.]

===============================================================
Class 2 programs terminate and stay resident and attempt to stop
undesirable activity.
===============================================================
C-4.COM, INSTALL.EXE
From: Interpath, 4423 Cheeney St., Santa Clara, CA 95054,
(408) 988 3832.
What it does:
This is a commercial product that costs $40.  It makes itself
resident, hooking vectors 9, 13, 21, 22, 26 and 2F.
A message pops up if any forbidden disk activity tries to take
place and gives you the option of allowing or aborting the
action. It protects against any program that attemots an interrupt
level write ti a disk, or any program that attempts to modify or
rename an EXE or COM program or CONFIG.SYS.
Evaluation:  It does not warn of batch file modifications. The vendor
has cooperative in modifying the program when indesirable interactions
with other TSR programs were found. Useful in a situation where
existing applications are being run.  Probably not suitable for use where
programmers are busy developing new programs. (These people seem to operate
the National BBS Society, too.) [T.S.]
- - - -
DPROTECT.ARC contains: DPROTECT.COM, DPROTECT.DOC, READ.ME.
From: Gee M. Wong for Public Domain use ONLY.
What it does:
It installs itself as a resident program, and monitors the use of the BIOS
level interupt 13H to protect one or more disks. If it detects a write
request to a protected disk, it will warn you and then reboot your PC.
Evaluation: Not very practical. I need to be able to write to my
hard disk. [T.S.]
- - - -
STOP1.ARC contains: NEWSTOP.ASM, NEWSTOP.COM, STOP.DOC.
From: Carey Nash, The Programmer's Forum, (818) 701-1021
What it does:
TSR that hooks interrupt 13H used for ALL low level disk I/O.
If write or format is requested, it will not allow interrupt 13 to
perform the command, but instead, it return a value to tell the calling
program that the write, or format was successful. It also uses interrupts 9
and 1C. It can be turned on and off from the keyboard.
Evaluation: When I tested it with a program that modifies sector 0,
it an error message saying A: was write protected. It might be
useful in particular circumstances with unknown programs, but I would
not recommend it for general use. [T.S.]
- - - -
HDSENTRY.ARC contains: HDSENTRY.ASC, HDSENTRY.ASM, HDSENTRY.COM, and
README.1ST.
From: Andrew M. Fried, 895 Cynthia Drive, Titusville, Fla. 32780
(305) 268-4500
What it does:
It will enable you to run any program on a floppy drive undisturbed, but
prevent most programs from accessing the hard disk for any type
of destructive call.  Nondestructive calls such as reading or resetting the
drive are permitted; formatting and writing to the disk are trapped and
prevented from occuring.  Interrupt 26h, the absolute disk write interrupt,
is also effectively removed from the system by this program.
Hooks interrupt vectors 13h and 26h.
Evaluation: Useful. It prevented a program from changing sector 0 on my hard
disk, although the program ran to completion and thought that it did. [T.S]
- - - -
BOMBSQAD.ARC contains: BOMBSQAD.COM, BOMBSQAD.DOC. (Version 1.3)
From: Andy Hopkins, 526 Walnut Lane, Swarthmore, PA 19081.
BBS: 302-764-7522
What it does:
It hooks interrupt vectors 13 and 70, intercepts calls,
displays what is going to happen, and asks if you want to continue
Evaluation:
It did stop calls to write to a sector on my hard drive, but it also
interfered with being able to read from A: when it should have allowed
that operation. [T.S.]
=================================================================
Class 3 Combination programs.  These combine a check of system files
with a TSR part that watches for dangerous disk activity.
=================================================================
FSP-12.ARC contains: $READ_ME.1ST, $TOC, FLUSHOT.DAT, FLU_POKE.COM,
FLU_REG.FRM, FSP.COM, FSP.TXT, F_FEED, HARDWARE.TXT, MY_OWN.CPY,
PRINT.BAT, RAMNET.TXT, REWARD.FRM, REWARD.LST, THE_COOP.TXT,
UPDATES.TXT. [Flu_shot+]
From: Ross M. Greenberg, 594 Third Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10016
BBS:(212)-889-6438.
What it does:
After performing a check sum of the three system files, it installs
itself as a TSR COMMAND.COM copy, hooking interrupt vectors
8, 9, 13, 20, 21, 26, 27 and 28.  It reads a data file that tells
how you wish files to be protected, e.g. no read, read only, no
EXE or COM or BAT files, etc.  When any program attempts to do something
forbidden, a pop-up window tells you and lets you abort or allow the
operation.
Evaluation: Although PC Magazine, June 88 recommended it, a number
of people have reported serious bugs that have not yet been fixed
by the author.  At this time, this version is *not* recommended.
=================================================================
Miscellaneous
=================================================================
CHK4BOMB.EXE ("Check for Bomb").
From: Andrew M. Fried, 895 Cynthia Drive, Titusville, Fla. 32780
(305) 268-4500
What it does:
It reads a .EXE of .COM program file from disk and attempts to spot
dangerous code and suspicious messages.
Evaluation: Useful for displaying text strings in program files, but of
almost no usefulness for virus protection. [T.S.]
- - - -
VIRU-SIM.TXT, VIRU-SIM.EXE.
From: National BBS Society/ICUG, 4423 Cheeney Street, Santa Clara, CA 95054.
Voice - 408 727 4559,   BBS - 408 988 4004
What it does:
VIRU-SIM is a program that simulates characteristic
activities that .COM and .EXE infector viruses use for
replication.  It also simulates some of the destructive
activities used by viruses to destroy disk information.  It does
not simulate the infection techniques of boot infector viruses
(such as the Pakistani Brain Virus).
VIRU-SIM may be used as a tool to test the effectiveness of
anti-viral measures and as demonstration tool for viral
replication activities.
VIRU-SIM is available free of charge from the BBS Society's
Homebase bulletin board, or is available on diskette for a $3.00
mailing and handling fee.
Evaluation: Useful for testing protection programs. [T.S.]

One way to get around the C-compiler virus (which exists only in the
executable and copies itself into any new version of the C compiler it
compiles) is to write a "quick and dirty" C _interpreter_ in C. This can
be safely compiled by the infected compiler (since presumably it can't
recognise and infect an interpreter), then you use the interpreter to
interpret the (clean) compiler source code compiling itself to generate
a (clean) compiler executable.

I have heard of a more insidious version of such a virus which lived in the
C compiler executable and the login executable. The login executable
allowed anyone who typed in a certain userid to log in as root without needing
a password, the compiler executable recognised that it was compiling "login"
an inserted the extra code - it also recognised if it was compiling a C
compiler and inserted the recognition code in that! Thus no trace of the
virus appeared in any source code. Totally unconfirmed rumour has it that
these executables actually made it out on a release tape, the implication
being that if large parts of AT&T became infected then after the next release
the virus author would have a back door into any UNIX system which had the
new release.

I believe that the rumor that you are speaking of is that of the first
C compiler.  Supposedly the authors (Kerningham and Ritchie) put this
little chunk of code in so they could log into any unix system.  If the
processes were listed, someone was running login (in actuallity, they
were floating around the system.)  This problem was quickly fixed with
the next version.

PS:  Fred Cohen briefly mentioned in his thesis that the NSA was rumored
     to having something like this floating around on various systems.
     As to its truth, I have no idea.

This is an old topic to people concerned with data integrity in VM/SP

There exists a clean version of the MODULE internally called by
RECEIVE and other commands, which won't accept partitioned files.
As far as I know, it is available to node administrators only from their

     It seems to me that it is easy enough to BROWSE or PEEK at an
incoming file before RECEIVEing it.  In such a situation, shouldn't
the extra files also be shown if one searches far enough through the file
listed in RDRLIST?  Another point, the hidden second (or third - is this

Send a malignant virus through such a method to IBM.  If it infects them,
then solution will be on the table within days, that is if IBM dares to admit
that they had been infected.

Please define "mature and informed".  Relate your definition to readers of this

any more risky than the "mature and informed".

When you have done that, please relate the study of the creation and

You may well see a whole lot more than just action by doing that.  No,
that is *not* a good idea to encourage.  I believe that William Murray
pointed out that the bug in VM/SP has already been fixed anyway.  Getting
attention in the above manner is, I repeat, *NOT* a good idea.

   It would be easy for a virus to avoid "online" detection by many of
the anti-viral software now available-- Simply have the virus check the
INT 13h vector before it does any disk work. If the vector does not go
directly to DOS, then abort and remain undetected. Now the virus has been
stopped from propagating, (and even fooled by a legitamate TSR that has put
its own hook in), but it still remains undetected.

   Another way around the use of interrupts would be to do its own low-level
disk I/O, but this would probably restrict it to one particular brand of PC-
hardware differences may prevent it. I suppose the best way would be to make
a table of all the INT 13h vectors for each release of the DOS, and use that.
Unless MS-DOS loads the read/write handlers into different places depending on
how the machine is booted up, the virus is shooting at stationary targets.

The other files are not visible to BROWSE or PEEK.  The number of lines
will differ between PEEK and Q RDR however.  Many people (I, for one)
ALWAYS PEEK incoming files before RECEIVEing them.  It's the handiest
way I know of deciding whether the file warrants your disk space.  For
example, I PEEK incoming VIRUS-L mail.  :-)

The suggestion about infecting IBM is a very bad one I think.

Why abort?  The virus can just take note of the vector, install a new
vector straight to DOS, and restore the old one when it's finished.
Alternatively it can just make direct calls to DOS without using the
interrupt vector at all.

I don't think much good could be done by banishing the list.
For one thing, if you're coming to this conclusion only now, it seems to me
to be a case of closing the barn door after the cows have escaped....This is
because
A. From what I've seen zip through my mailbox on here in just 1 day, I could
wreak some pretty heavy havoc in a number of places, were I the twisted,
childish type of person that goes in for that sort of "fun", so as far as
banishing the list from that standpoint, hey, the damage has already been done,
we might as well keep it up to protect ourselves.

B.A lot of whats been floating around recently have been discussions of old
virii and their related cures, so anybody wanting to glean virus-writing hints
from here is going to have to lookm a lot harder elsewhere. Besides, if they're
THAT determined, they'll do it without our "help", and are probably capable of
more insidious things than what they read.

Granted, we do want to keep this out of the hands of 13-yr old pimple faces and
others who haven't the maturity to keep from writing these little beasties, and
I'm not saying we should post the source to XMAS EXEC or (c)BRAIN on the list,
but it seems to me that if somebody wants to write a virus bad enough, they'll
do it....I've  amazed myself a number of times at the coding solutions I've
come up with to various problems(NOT, **NOT** Virii) over the years, and I'm
sure that there are people out there who are a hell of a lot more clever than
me..not that we should throw our arms up in the air either and wait for the
next sicko to come down the | (pipe :), but use the list for what I believe it
ewas started for..to share and communicate information about virii and ways of
stopping them...

I strongly oppose the idea of banishing or censoring this list.  I
oppose the idea that information about viruses should be hidden from
public view.  How can we fight a problem we don't understand?  The
only folks who will get hurt by ignorance are those of us trying to
keep our environments virus-free.  Keeping viruses an open subject
helps us to fight them.  It MAY help the virus-writers as well, but
there are probably at least 300 users for each virus-writer.  Seems
to me the help is way into the profit-margin.

May I remind readers of this list that most computer crimes are committed
by computer professionals, NOT "13-year old pimple faces"?  May I also point
out that such computer-viruses as the XMAS EXEC and the Macintosh "Happy
Birthday" were written by (supposedly) mature adults.

Such characterizations only serve to promote a stereotype which, as far
as I'm concerned, is as far from the truth of the matter as one can get.

An interesting article.  It describes (presumably) this list as "Techies

exchanging an endless stream of messages daily about virus effects, vaccine
strategies, and gossip."  A fairly accurate, yet somewhat trivializing,
description.

I have a problem with some of the vendors.  Digital Dispatch, for example,
claims to have the National Computer Security Center, a branch of the NSA,
as a customer.  I spoke with someone I know at their Office of Research
and Development this morning.  She said they purchased a copy of DataPhysician
for evaluation.  We just did so too.  I guess they will say we are a customer.
We, of course, are a customer.  But when your average PC owner reads that,
he/she will view that as an endorsement on our part.  It certainly is not.
That's marketing for you.

Would it be possible to design an environment in a different operating
system to check viruses without the risk of having them infect a disk?
For example, you want to check a diskette which is formatted for MS-DOS
for the possible existence of a virus. Could you set up an AMIGA or
a Macintosh to emulate MS-DOS and detect a suspected virus without
the risk of having it contaminating your own system? This is a sketchy
idea, true, but I thought I'd ask it anyway.

I suppose anything is possible, but the amount of work required would be
quite another subject. I've seen programs written in one version of DOS
that could read files written in completely incompatible versions of DOS
*on the same machine*. I've also seen an Atari ST emulating a Macintosh
with near-perfection. Which brings me to a question: if you were to set
up an emulator, how do you protect it against virus infection? My understanding
of the Mac emulator on the Atari is that probably could be infected, though
I've had no hands-on experience with the emulator or with viruses.

For all intents and purposes, those computer-viruses which infect the Macintosh
via the System (or other) files, and which don't directly affect hardware
would have a similar affect when using the Magic Sac Plus emulator on the
Atari ST.  Because that emulator does not currently work with HyperCard
though, there would be little chance of becoming infected with the "Happy
Birthday" computer-virus which came, as I've been told, on one of the public
domain HyperCard stacks.

I have not, up to this time, encountered a computer-virus using the Magic
Sac Plus -- but I haven't been using any of the newer public domain software
with it either.

Using the pc-ditto emulator on an Atari ST would, I think, make the disk
drives more susceptible to some of the computer-viruses which have been
found on IBM systems.  (The Atari ST can read and write IBM 3.5" disks
directly.)

In any case, when using software on a machine, whether that machine is being
"emulated" or not, the simple precautions against computer-viruses should
still be taken.

It is much easier to simply run the suspect code on a system
without a hard disk.  That is what I did when I downloaded
PK36.EXE, the latest version of PKARC, from SIMTEL20.  We
have a PC-Convertible that has only two diskettes, no hard disk.

I suppose this is an effective defense against simple Trojans,
but a delayed-trigger virus or Trojan may get past it.

It would be possible; maybe not that easy.  A virtual machine could
be created to emulate a PC with, say, two virtual floppy drives and a
virtual hard drive.  The host machine would emulate the drives using
swap space on its hard drive.  I don't know of any way a virus could
infect the host machine via swapping.

Such an emulator could have various virus-oriented features, such as
automatic trace of disk access -- what tracks were accessed and what
files, and what net changes had been made to disk contents.  It could
also trace memory accesses to determine whether any funny business
was going on in memory.

Such an emulator would be pretty bulletproof, since it would be
interpreting all of the machine code and never executing it direct-
ly.  A PC with a hard drive would be a good candidate for the host
as well, although it would be desperately slow.

Xerox workstations have a feature that allows you to stick a PC
emulator card in the back and run a PC window.  The workstations
have a real floppy you can use, but allow you to create as many
virtual floppies as you need.  This might be a fairly safe way to

It would be possible; maybe not that easy.  A virtual machine could
be created to emulate a PC with, say, two virtual floppy drives and a
virtual hard drive.  The host machine would emulate the drives using
swap space on its hard drive.  I don't know of any way a virus could
infect the host machine via swapping.

Such an emulator could have various virus-oriented features, such as
automatic trace of disk access -- what tracks were accessed and what
files, and what net changes had been made to disk contents.  It could
also trace memory accesses to determine whether any funny business
was going on in memory.

Such an emulator would be pretty bulletproof, since it would be
interpreting all of the machine code and never executing it direct-
ly.  A PC with a hard drive would be a good candidate for the host
as well, although it would be desperately slow.

Xerox workstations have a feature that allows you to stick a PC
emulator card in the back and run a PC window.  The workstations
have a real floppy you can use, but allow you to create as many
virtual floppies as you need.  This might be a fairly safe way to
test code.  I'm not going to try it anytime soon, though.  If you
do try it, try it on someone else's Xerox.  :-)  By the way, other
machines have similar features.

    I became aware of viruses or virus-like codes around 1973.  My mentors
informed me of virii in existence (at least in idea form) in 1968.  This
places these creations firmly in the mainframe era.  I remember hearing
about self-replicating code in college in 1973 *for certain* although I can't
recall the context.  It was discussed in benign and malevolent scenarios.
    I had also been informed of a virus like code implanted in a piece of
software that was actually distributed by the vendor.  It was benign (sort of).
It existed on SDS Sigma series machines running UTS (later CP-V) which had the
Extended Fortran-IV compiler.  The trap operated like this.  If a users' source
code contained the statement *GO TO JAIL (assigned GO TO) the compiler would
issue an error code something along these lines:
   *Warning, go directly!  Do not pass go.  Do not collect $200.
Then the compiler would cease compilation.  The programmer that planted this
little trick went to some trouble to disguise it.  The recognition string in
the compiler was coded in as a series of bytes in their decimal equivalents of
the appropriate EBCDIC codes, along with totally misleading commenting.
The string was declared external and actually referenced in a different module
by code that was also misleadingly commented.  A dedicated analyst could find
it if they looked hard enough and had sufficient access to the system and
listings.

* GO TO JAIL and WARNING, GO DIRECTLY!...  are taken from the MONOPOLY game, of
course, which is property, and a trademark of Parker Brothers.

<Sigh> Haven't we had enough unconfirmed rumours?  This one's even libellous
(though I see Joseph has cleverly spelt Brian Kernighan's name wrong to halve
his liability).  Fact: Ken Thompson was the culprit, he described it in his
1983 Turing Award lecture (see Comm. ACM August 1984), and it wasn't his
intention to provide himself with a worldwide Unix trapdoor.  In fact, if anyone
outside AT&T and Bell can *prove* to me that they have a current compiler with
his Trojan I'll donate 10 pounds to the charity of their choice.

Hey, wanna hear about the Vatican conspiracy in the VAX microcode?

P.S. Of course, I'm not saying it *can't* be done, or that it *hasn't* been.
But let's not get carried away, hmm?

  I think XMAS EXEC was written by a university student.  Having

I have just  seen a  demonstration of VACCINE.  This program
computes  a  32 bit CRC for all or  any  known programs  and
permits them to run unimpeded.  For any unknown  program, it
will  exclude it altogether, or  permit it to run only  in a
protective shell.  At installation option, it will check the
crc  at  boot time or at runtime.  While  the  overhead  for
checking at  boot time is noticeable, that  for  checking at
run time is not.  While  the impact on the user  for running
in the protective shell is noticeable, this need not be done
often and does not involve any special set-up or invocation.

In addition to the obvious application of protecting a given
machine against viruses, this product can  also be useful in
protecting communities of machines.  It can also be used for
limitng  users to  authorized programs  and  for helping  to
ensure sompliance with license agreements.

This program is a product of Foundation Ware and must be distinguished
from other products with similar names.

I was just reading the reaview of "VAccine" by FoundationWare.
I had the opportunity (with Chris Bracy and Joe Sieczkowski)
to go out to San Francisco recently (I'm an East Coatster myself),
and test out Vaccine for FoundationWare.

To tell the truth, its a very good package for businesses
and government, but I wouldn't recommend it for the average
programmer.

Several other companies have released anti-viral programs
based on the Vaccine Shell, and I remain against the idea.

The probelem with a shell is that you must OKAY software
before you run it.  That means if you are writing a program,
you must take a bunch more keystrokes to okay it each time
you run it.  With Vaccine, that often takes some doing.

I can't compalain abou tit though.  It does stop any virus
I've run accross yet.  And it is probably good for places
that do no programming.

Unfortuanatley (please excuse my typing, I am on a dumb
terminal with no backspace or delete!) I remain unimpressed
with most anti-viral packages.  I haven't found one that
I truely like.

FoundationWare's owner challedned Chris, Joe and I to try
to break their program, and we were able to come up with
a few designs to do it in just under 10 minutes.

Average viruses woul,dn't come up with what we doid however.

Of all the shell programs, Vaccine is one of the best, but
again, I would not use one.  You cannot program.  Your
compute becomes an isolated machine.

I have worked with the Xerox compiler that gave the cute $200 message. It was
when I worked at CERN, on a Cii 10070 (a French identical copy of a Sigma 7).
However I am not aware that it stopped compiling after generating the message.
Near as I could tell it just issued a warning and carried on. Mind you, I
didn't make a habit of using JAIL as a variable in a GOTO statement, just did
it once or twice for fun. So I could easily not have noticed that behaviour.

Subject:      VM/SP Release 5 doesn't RECEIVE hidden files;

Hello,

this is good news, and not an unconfirmed rumour.

On thursday, I had started writing my note in order to tell you that
VM/SP Release 5 contained an antidote to the possible poisining uncovered
by Jefferson Ogata's contribution.  As I could neither find it in SC24-
5290-0 "Release 5 Guide", nor in SC24-5330-0 "Using Release 5 Enhance-
ments", I thought I was wrong, and announced this NETSERV stuff, instead.

Now, I looked it up in SC19-6209-4 "CMS Command Reference, Release 5",
and -- heureka! -- there it sits and waits for you!  I cannot under-
stand why they didn't mention it in the other two books (one of them is
nearly two inches thick!).  Perhaps, they were ashamed admitting impli-
citly that they had to remove a serious flaw in their design :-)

The RECEIVE and READCARD commands have been enhanced with a new triple of
options: FULLPROMPT, MINPROMPT, and NOPROMPT.  With RECEIVE, the default
is MINPROMPT, and with READCARD (seldom used), it is NOPROMPT -- that's
the risky one :-(

The explanation for MINPROMPT says:
> Minprompt
>    specifies that a prompt is issued when the name of the first (or
>    only) file differs from the name of the spool file; the prompt for
>    the first file is suppressed when it has the same name as the spool
>    file.  A prompt is always issued for the second an subsequent files.

Further explanations show that RECEIVE will prompt you for hidden files
from partioned data sets in DISK DUMP and NETDATA format, whilst it will
read in continuously punched spool files into a single (and harmless)
disk file with all those :READ statements embedded.

READCARD will accept punched spool files and create multiple disk files
from them, evaluating the :RDR statements.

In any case, no file will creep onto your disk unnoticed, if you use the
MINPROMPT or FULLPROMPT option: instead, you'll be notified and prompted
for approval of every file.

There remains one dark spot. A usage note for the RECEIVE command says:
> The MVS with TSO Extension Program Product ... can send, as a unique
> case of multiple files in one transmission, one note and a data file
> together.  The note will be the first file in the transmission and the
> data file will be second.  RECEIVE will add the note to the appropriate
> notebook, receive the data file, and give informative messages for each
> action.  This is the only form of multiple NETDATA files supported by
> the RECEIVE command.

This paragraph has come unaltered from the Release 4 manual.  As the last
sentence clearly contradicts the new sections on MINPROMPT, I still hope
that it is an oversight by the authors, and RECEIVE will not only
"give an informative message" for the second file but rather ask the
user for approval.

We plan to introduce Release 5, tomorrow.  And I'd gladly appreciate a
MVS/TSO volunteer to sending me a duplicate file as outlined in the
quotation above.  I hope, it is specific enough to be followed by a
MVS/TSO user.  I'll shortly report to the list the results of this
test, and possibly other experiences with Release 5.

Best regards
             Otto Stolz
