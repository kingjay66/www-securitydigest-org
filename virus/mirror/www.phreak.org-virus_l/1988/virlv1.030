We have had two people that have been give a programme called
Font Fooler (Mac) that was supposed to be a neat utility for playing
with Fonts.  When run, (after checking for the usual little critters)
the programme finds Font files and trashes them.

Anyone else seen this little gem?

This sounds like a local Trojan. We haven't had any reports of it around
here. I'll forward this to the INFO-MAC list -- if I get any responses I'll
post them back.

[Ed. Thanks for the prompt reply, Joe!  For those who may be wondering
how we could get a query and an answer to the query in the same
digest, I forwarded the message to Joe when I received it, as Joe has
more Mac experience than I (read: any Mac experience at all) and has
graciously offerred to help out with Mac problems whenever possible.
Thank you for your time, Joe!]

I'd also like to hear something about anti-virus software for Sun Work
Stations.

Subject:  genetic engineering of computer viruses

As Mitchel Ludwig (kmfludw@vax1.cc.lehigh.edu) pointed out, a virus
COULD be used to eradicate another virus.  It could also be used for
many other things, such as killing off worms, trojan horses, etc.  It
could even be used to update system files or software on PCs (or
mainframes, or whatever).

(putting on flame-retardent)
But if I EVER HEAR OF ANYONE DOING THIS TO MY SYSTEM WITHOUT MY
PERMISSION, I WILL CALL THE APPROPRIATE AUTHORITIES.
(removing flame-retardent)

If the virus were nice enough to alert you of what it was doing AND
give you a chance to stop it in its tracks, that MIGHT be ok, provided
it also had an auto-eradication option and didn't interfere in the use
of my computer in any way.

Any comments?  Direct useful stuff to the list, flames or trivial
stuff to me.

Subject: Is Morris the Only Culpable Party?

I am somewhat surprised at the lack of comments on the culpability of
(1) the programmer who implemented the gaping trap door in the mailer
which RTM exploited, and/or (2) the organizations that
sold/distributed this software.

Is Morris the only person to blame for the debacle?
