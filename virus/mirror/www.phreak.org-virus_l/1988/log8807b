Subject:      Scores Arrest - Hold It!

          *** ATTENTION ALL READERS! MUCHO IMPORTANTE! ***

After some phone calls here and there, and some background checking by
Mark Trumbull of the Christian Science Monitor, we have found that, yes,
Mr. Burleson was arrested on charges of computer sabotage and burglary.
He was NOT, however, the perpetrator of the Scores virus. A Wall Street
Journal article (page 1, Friday, June 17), detailed that he was accused
of the above in connection with a company called USPA&IRA. Not EDS, not
Scores, something else entirely.

See what I get for jumping off a cliff with a single source? PLEASE tell
everyone you have told that the arrest was, alas, a rumor.  It's probably
spread faster than the virus itself!

Subject:      Question about virus simulator



As mentioned here some time back, the National Bulletin Board Society
has a product called a virus simulator.  They also, by the way, market
an anti-virus program, but its name escapes me at the moment.  Does
anyone have any experience with their virus simulator that you could relate
to VIRUS-L readers?  It's supposed to test an anti-virus package against
most of the current known virus infiltration methods.  I've heard some
conflicting messages about its usefulness, though.  For example, it is
alleged to come up with erroneous reports against some of the current
crop of anti-virus products by reporting that a particular virus would
be able to infect the system, when the opposite has been proven to be true.
It would be interesting to hear some independent evaluation(s) of this
product.  Any comments on this sort of testing scheme?

Subject:      New version of PKARC on-line


I finally got around to updating the PKARC program that's on-line
here at Lehigh for VIRUS-L readers.  I now have the file PK36 UUE
available on the LISTSERV.  The file was downloaded directly (by me)
from SIMTEL20.ARPA.  Keith Peterson got the version on SIMTEL20.ARPA
directly from Phil Katz's bboard.

As with all of the binaries on the LISTSERV, PK36 is distributed
as a uuencoded file.  See the monthly announcement message for
instructions on how to uudecode this file back into a binary file.

Subject:      possible virus?


I heard just yesterday that one of my friends was having trouble with
a copy of Norton Utilities version 3.00.  He pointed out that the copy
which he runs from a protected floppy disk works well, but when he
loads that copy onto his hard disk, it fails.  He also noted that the
copy from the protected disk showed differences between itself and the
hard disk copy he had just made.  The problem repeated several times.
No other symptoms.

Any ideas?  I have not tried to copy this material to my machine, I
have not asked about the date signature on the copies, or about the
sizes of the files.

Subject: Seminar by Fred Cohen


Date  : 20 Jul 1988

    Models of Practical Defenses Against Computer Viruses

                         Fred Cohen
                  University of Cincinnati

Computer viruses are pieces of programs that attach themselves to
other executable programs.  When that executable program is run, the
virus searches for yet another executable program and infects it with
the virus.  Besides spreading the infection, a virus can perform
malicious actions like erasing files or randomly changing data.

In this talk, we describe a way to detect computer viruses and
prevent them from spreading before they cause significant damage.
We show how this method can be used to protect information in both
trusted and untrusted computing bases, show the optimality of this
technique, and present the results of experimental trials in two
computing environments.

Due to an error on the part of Rich Zellich, the Internet maintainer of
the List of Mailing Lists, I am incorrectly listed in the new issue of NetMonth
as the owner of Virus-L.  I notified Rich of his mistake as soon as I received
his update list, several weeks ago, but he apparently couldn't correct it
in time to prevent the error in NetMonth.  I have notified Chris Condon
of the error.

A version of ZOO for VAX/VMS arrived over the net yesterday on Info-VAX.. an

number of bad PKARC versions that are out there, can anyone vouch for this?

Anyone have source?

A quick check shows that it was probably written in C, and has many plausible-

From:         Joe Simpson <JS05STAF@MIAMIU>
Subject:      Final (I hope) posting on Miami U. spring epidemic

In two earlier postings I described what we thought we knew about an
MS-DOS based virus epidemic at Miami.  We were afflicted with the
standard (non destructive) version of Brain with numerous complaints of
lost data.  As part of our early response we used rather draconian
measures to copy (some) user data from affected diskettes to clean
media.  We kept many of the origionals that were reported as defective.

These diskettes were sorted into categories, probably using Norton utilities.
A stratified sample was then subjected to more detailed analysis with the
following results:
1.  Some media were physically defective.
2.  Brain existed on some diskettes.  No mutated version of Brian was found
    using byte level comparision with a known standard Brain.


Conclusion:   There is no reproducible evidence that Miami was visited by
a virus that deliberately attemped to alter or destroy user data.  Fred Cohen
spent a morning with us at the height of our confusion and suspected a mutated
Brain.  We have been unable to corroborate this.

Critique of our performance:
1.  The draconian measures we took in the early days resulted in loss of user
    data.  Lack of a formal coordinating body and ignorance of the topic of
    computer viruses caused us to continue these measures longer than was
    desirable.
2.  Lack of awareness of the problem probably caused us to ignore very early
    warning signs resulting in the crisus occuring at our busiest time of
    year.
3.  Our efforts at communicating information about the virus were as accurate
    as practical, but most reports did not accurately describe the situation
    as currently understood.  Reporters made best efforts to be factual, but
    (at least in my opinion) were intimidated by the word "computer".  This is
    very puzzeling.  If you remove the word computer, they are more competent
    than most computer professionals to communicate public health information.
4.  In retrospect, it is easy to see that modification of "nominal" behavior
    at Miami before the epidemic would have severely reduced the cost.  In
    particular our habit of initializing with DOS provided the perfect
    "media" for Brain.

Notes:
1.  We were visited by two destructive viruses in the Mac world.
2.  There is some Mac software offering partial protection (Vaccine cdev)
    without seriously affecting the working environment (except for
    programmers).  There are also several programs designed to detect
    (obvious) viruses including virus detective and RX. These are cheap!
3.  We have yet to find anything good in the MS-DOS world, either to
    provide protection or diagnosis.
4.  Our Novel server based laboratories had very few internal problems.
    Whether this is due to lack of archetecture in MS-DOS or due to the
    characteristics of Brain is hard to ascertain.

It's not usually considered wise to accept (blindly) any executable image
from an unfamiliar (untrusted) source.  At the very least, follow up with
the people who posted the file to find out where they got it, and try to
obtain an original copy directly from the author.  Of course, this is
just my opinion...

Have you examined/tried things and found them wanting?  If so, it
might be interesting/informative to post something like mini-reviews
to the list.   I'm sure lots of other folk are on the same quest...
