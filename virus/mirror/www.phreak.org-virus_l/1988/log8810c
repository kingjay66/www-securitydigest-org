We're speaking about the *currently known* mac viruses. Theyinfect
either system files on the boot-up disk or/and applications when
these are invoked. No doubt that you can write a virus that detects
all volumes on line and infects part or all of the applications on
these volumes (as long as they're not write-protected), but apparently
no one has done this yet (knock on wood).

sounds like most places you've been are a lot more lenient than our place
 over here....
We just had a nasty bit of business where a student consultant either wrote
a VMS trojan .COM file or showed a user how to write a .COM file, which was
then sent around the system and managed to zap a few accounts before the
file was discovered.

No short chain for him.....he was fired faster than a speeding bullet..
It turned out that he didn't really DO anything in terms of writing or
distributing the beast, but just the mere fact that his name came up a
few times in the resulting inquisition was enough to get him canned...

Subject:      Isn't "hacker" an honorific?

        I find it troublesome--and perhaps even a subject that has
ethical implifications--that in the current discussion about the
student who wrote a virus that got away, the term "hacker" is used
as if it were some sort of label applied to a class of criminals, like
the label "burglar".  As I understood the original use of the term,
it described those who make computers do what they they want the
silly machines to do, as opposed to "loosers" who can only do what
the machine (and its administrators and programmers) lets them do.
Admittedly some HACKERS want to do undesirable things with their
machines, but others write EMACS.  Considering the fact that
the virus in question was written in some sort of job control language
and that it blew up in its author's face--he sounds more like a looser
than a hacker.  Users often want to do undesirable things to0.

        The use of the word "hacker" on this list thus seems to me
a rather unpleasent example of group defamation.  I suspect
that part of the dislike for hackers that is expressed within
the computer community is based, not on the fact that some hacks are
nasty, but on the fact that hackers are free, i.e., out of control,
i.e., out of the control of those who don't like people to be free.

        On the other hand, perhaps there is no ethical issue at all.
Perhaps the word "hacker" has come to be a pejorative because
words change their meanings over time, and that is all there is to
it.  After all, I my old highschool geometry teacher worked during
the summer as a computer.  Words do change.

Your point is well taken. Here at U of Maryland we are very concerned
with network server security. That is why we are trying to implement
an NFS server to serve all of the three types of microcomputers in
our public workstation rooms. A Network File System offers Unix
style security for our users programs and data ( i.e. a user can run
a program from a execute only disk and still have read/write access
to his data files on the server).
     It seems to me, that you are against any write access to a server
because of the potential for a virus to infect public programs.:-) Do

you think that, because of a *potential* threat, we should limit the
functionality of our servers?

Subject:      Re : Ex hackers

I think we are getting carried away with this argument about employing
ex-hackers so i will try to make this short.
1. I have a friend who used to hack around with our university's
   giant CDC CYBER a few years ago when we were both in high-school.
   We had access to the computer as we were doing a form of "graduation
   paper" for school.
   That person was caught messing around with resources he had no access to
   (like accounts he used to "borrow"). He was reported to school and was
   punished in the form of "not to lay foot on the computer building as
   long as he in college".
   This person is working up to this date as consultant on the same
   computer site (and believe me, he is good at what he is doing (advising
   on languages and operating system). Just don't say they (the computer
   operators) have short memory - they knew exactly who they were hiring.
2. I  remember myself trying to hack around with the same computer
   ("with a little help from my friends") not always doing honest things.
   Today i am working next door as member of the system staff on a UNIX system
   on the same university and also have privileged access to that CDC.

So, to the main point - the reason some of hackers do "bad" things is
because they are bounded and they like the game of trying to loosen the
tights. (i hope my English is right)
Give them enough space (i.e privileges) and suddenly they stop hacking
and start acting like "grownups" and do useful things.
Now don't get me wrong - IN NO WAY YOU SHOULD ENCOURAGE HACKING !!.
But when it comes to hiring a person to a job requiring "privileged access",
the fact he used to be a hacker should NOT misqualify him automaticaly !
Don't judge a book by it's cover.
I'm sure most system administrators have enough brains to smell
a trouble maker in few days - before he is given enough privileges.

Sorry for the length of this posting - it makes me furious to hear opinions
like "once a hacker always a hacker" as if hacker means thief.
I'm sure many of you reading this posting used to be hackers too,
so let's concentrate in more important things like how to prevent
unwanted penetrations to systems (which ofcourse includes trojan-horses).

thanks for listening.

I've been a 'hacker' for 32 years.  I wrote programs for Lehigh
computers to do things I thought needed doing even though no one asked
for them.
  I don't attack other people's computers because I don't want people
attacking mine.  (Fred Cohen attacked one of mine and I dumped him off
of it immediately.)
  Sometimes I attack one of my own computers, but usually by accident.
  Lets find some other term for the malicious ones and keep 'hacker'
for the guy who likes to see what useful things he can do with a
computer.
  I wonder how you get someone to pay a $2300 fine without going to
court?  Also, would he have paid if he knew he was going to be thrown
out of school?  The fact that the school could re-consider and up the
penalties proves that universities are not bound by such minor
legalities as double jeopardy.

Oftentimes, a student who has a reputation for being a "hacker,"
or experienced computer user, might be charged with computer mischief
merely for being labelled as such, even though s/he might not be the
type of person who would ever do anything maliciously.

Please... stop using the word 'hacker' if you don't know what it means...

Users who maliciously destroy data, plant viruses, Trojan horses, etc are
usually too dumb/ignorant to qualify as hackers. I had XMAS EXEC sent to
my CMS account last winter, and I took the usual precaution of _looking_ at
it before running it.  It was _immediately_ obvious to be what it was
supposed to do (i.e. display a XMAS tree and send copies of itself to all
the folks in my NAMES file), so I did not run it, and I sent a stern
warning to the person who sent it to me; however, it was written in such an
amaterurish matter that it really made me puke.

It is my understanding that _most_ viri, Trojans, etc are written by
children under 18 are primitive and full of bugs that render them less
harmful than meant by their authors.

A 'hacker' is, generally speaking, an anthusiastic systems programmer---
nothing less, nothing more. The media (flame=on) sometimes misuse this
term to describe what really are phreaks and/or crackers. Well, one may
follow this usage, and one may use the term 'virus' generically instead of
'Trojan horse' or 'time bomb' etc, and one will sound like one does not
know what one is talking about, which is probably the case. (flame=off).

Programming expertise and a malicious destruction of other people's data
seldom coincide.

Now, about employing 'hackers' (crackers) in computer centers: I think it's
a real bad idea. A person caught snooping around other people's data (even
w/o destroying anything) cannot be trusted with the power inherent in
(almost) any systems support job. Even a lowly student consultant is
in position to notice passwords being typed, for example. In the past (I mean
real dark past, 10--15 years ago) there were so few knowledgeable users
available that (school) DP people had to hire such folks as consultants etc
because they picked up something about the system while snooping which they
could pass on to othet users. Well, today the systems are (somewhat) easier
to use, and the pool of knowledgeable users is much wider, so the cracker
types can and should be blacklisted.

Users caught trying to destroy other users' data or to interfere with the
operation of the computer center ought to be punished in the most severe
manner available. Some years ago I had some of my files erased by a sicko
who was working for the computer center (a realy psychopath). I was not
too happy about it, obviously.

I think SUNY@Albany was completely right in kicking the butt of the loser
who tried to launch a virus and could not do even that competently. It's
too bad they could not put him to jail as well. They should also publicize
the incident as widely as possible. Hopefully, this will make others like
the student in question think twice before attempting to write something
like this. Being lenient with system abusers generated a wrong kind of message
--- that systen abuse is tolerated at this particular installation.

It is difficult for me to assess the appropriateness of the punishment.
I have no difficulty at all with the $2380.   As I understand the
original submission, this was restitution, not a fine.  It is well
settled in common law that anyone who plays with dangerous things is
liable to others for any damage that he causes.

As to probation, as recommended by the Student Committee on Conduct, and
expulsion, as granted by the authorities on appeal from the system
administrators, it seems to me that there is some data missing.  I would
like to know what rules, besides the obvious social ones against playing
with dangerous substances in crowded places, were violated.  Under what
explicit rules or agreements did the student use the system?  What
sanctions were provided in those rules or agreements?  If the punishment
was imposed "ex post facto," then I have some little sympathy.  However,
if the student knowingly put himself in danger of a published sanction,
then I have none at all.

Participation in an academic environment carries with it certain
responsibilites.  These include the responsibility not to "blot
another's copy book," use his work without proper attribution, and not
to tamper with his experiments.  Because it is often difficult to
understand how these rules apply in a computer environment, I think that
it behooves a self-interested academic community to put its members on
explicit notice.  In order to enforce their interest, such a community
must be prepared to shun, ostracize, and expel those who violate the
notices.  While I can sympathize with one who unintentionality offends
in the absence of such explicit notice, I do not necessarily believe
that the failure to give notice about every possible kind of offense
compromises the right of the community to invoke sanctions for offenses
that fall under the broad definitions of unacceptable behavior.

In the UK, a minority of people would know of the term "cracker".  A
book (third issue came out this year) called "The Hacker's Handbook", on
the subject of connecting to other people's systems and logging in, only
makes it more confusing.  I saw a list of many terms used in the USA of
which (fortunately) few have alternative meanings in the UK.  Outside
the specialist terms from MIT etc, onto mundane things...  a (US) bus is
a (UK) coach [eg Greyhound], and a (Can) pavement is a (UK) road. I was
*very* confused by that until I found a (Can) sidewalk is a (UK) pavement.
"Get on the pavement" could be dangerous!    Suggestions anyone?

A couple of related things...  First, the arguments (both for and
against) about hiring "hackers" have gone on for quite some time now
with both sides making very interesting points.  I suggest that they
be continued on the ETHICS-L list, as suggested by a reader, however.
The same goes for the arguments about the definition/history of the
term "hacker"; interesting as it is, it doesn't really have much of a
place here.  Both things can be argued ad infinitum with neither side
claiming a decisive victory.

Thanks in advance for everyone's cooperation on this matter.

Please tell us there's more to this than what you said, in
particular "he didn't really do anything but just the mere fact that
his name came up a few times".  On that basis you would be firing
your top and most accessible instructors who provide information in
the most understandable way.  I've taught hundreds of people how to
write in various languages.  Some of them I've spent a lot of time
helping.  Are you saying that if one of them wrote a destrustive
program and then told you I taught him a language, and several
others said I often answered such questions, then I'd be out like a
speeding bullet?  (In such a case I guarantee my lawyer would beat
up your lawyer.)

Just a comment...weren't the original founders of APPLE Computers considered to
be hackers?  This isn't a flame but a commentary.  One can learn a lot by
poking around programs etc., perhaps a lot more than in school.  Like every-
thing else there are "good" ones and "bad" ones

I have no desire to limit systems, I am interested only in becoming
aware (and in helping others to become aware) of the threat and what
we will have to do to protect against it.

Thus far it seems to me that:

No conventional MS-DOS or MAC stand alone installation that accepts
executable files from another system is safe.  (The basic failure is
that there is no forbidden code area that any user program cannot
penetrate in either of these designes.  Thus, anything that the virus
writer wants to do, s/he can do.)

No system (whatever its form) that permits a user to write executable
code for another user to execute is safe if the later executer
(pardon the english) is a system level user or has serious files to
protect.

The best safety is in the form of a lock with a known form but an
unknown key.  (There is no way to permanently hide the form of the
lock.  The design of the Yale lock is known to many.  The shape of the
key however, can be hidden from the perp ((as we say in Hill Street))
and can be changed at will.)

Finally, I know of no existing virii that do the nasty things that the
above imply.  I know that some will come though.

Len Levine lists some problems that allow viruses to propogate:

I would suggest that the first of these things is not at all
necessary for a virus to spread and to do damage, and that the
second of these things is a necessary feature of any real system
at all (there are no systems where no one executes any code
that was written by someone else, and every serious user has
at least one serious file).

Because of these thoughts, I would object (again) to any suggestion
that MS-DOS and MAC systems are more vulnerable to viruses
than are any other systems.  How about changing the sentence
in question to read:

> No conventional computer installation that accepts
> executable files from another system is safe.

Forgive me if I harp on this, but I'm constantly reading and
hearing how it's just these silly micros that are vulnerable to
viruses, and that as soon as they get to be more like mainframes,
we'll be safe.   It's not true...

On the otherhand, I agree wholeheartedly that known-form locks
with unknown keys are a very promising approach to all this.

I support Gregg TeHennepe's urge that we move this to ETHICS-L.  Two
reasons, first the traffic is voluminous and has to be sorted
through by those interested in the more technical aspects of
viruses, second ETHICS-L has been completely silent for months and
is defined as the forum for just this kind of discussion, second and
a half - this is getting boring but I feel the need to stay sub_
scribed to VIRUS-L for the technical stuff and the discussion on who
is a "hacker", did the Albany student get too much or too little,
etc.  has gotten beaten to death (and boredom) already.

Us liberals (card carrying etc.) often find that the punishment is
supposed to follow conviction, not precede arrest.  Well, enough of

ETHICS-L has been far from silent.  Maybe you should resubscribe.
Maybe some of the rest of you should subscribe.  I'm enjoying the
discussions and sharpening my sense of fairness/justice.

On January 26, the host server became ETHICS-L@POLYGRAF (it had been
UGA before).  A reminder to others on the list:  DO NOT SEND SUBSCRIPTION
OR UNSUBSCRIPTION REQUESTS TO THE LIST unless you really want to make
thousands of copies of a simple administrative request (and make yourself
look dumb).  The correct form is (assuming CMS, and that you do not know
a list peer closer to you than POLYGRAF, wherever that is):

TELL LISTSERV AT POLYGRAF SUB ETHICS-L your name

Notice "AT" instead of "@", and of course substitute your name as you
want it to appear in files sent to you, in place of "your name".
You don't need to provide your Userid or node:  the LISTSERV picks them
up from the message envelope.

Right, I mentioned it.  The Yale lock is the conventional lock like
you find on most doors.  Blueprints of that lock are easily available
and any person who wants to know how it works can find out.  However
the height of a pin (which determines the depth of the notch in the
key at that point), can only be found out by disassembling that lock,
and thus, unless you can examine carefully an individual lock, you
cannot guess at the key.

My analogy was to a software protection package, in which the
technique is known, but the code word, or the file name used is an
individual choice on an individual machine.  Anyone can know that I
use a CRC protection algorythm, but what value I use for the CRC
polynomial is known only to me.  If that polynomial were public, a
virus writer could easily build a virus that overlays part of a
program, and changes just a byte or two to regenerate the same CRC.

Here's hoping that the virus scare does not result in a witch hunt
(and wizard hunt) for suspicious programmers, reminiscent of Joe
McCarthy's crusade against domestic Communism of the 1950s.  I don't
mean to imply that actual perpetrators of viruses should not be
detected and punished...I only mean that due process should be the norm.
For example, no virus case should lack expert witnesses in the
form of systems programmers testifying for the defense and prosecution.

Administrative proceedings should mimic court proceedings, and give
suspected programmers something like due process.  This is morally
justified by the fact that loss of a computer account can be a serious
matter for an individual; this is pragmatically justified since it will
prevent some unnecessary lawsuits by aggrieved individuals.

I don't agree that this thread should move to ETHICS-L.  We are writing
at the intersection of viruses and computer ethics.  If the thread
moves to ETHICS-L, then technicians uninterested in broad ethical
issues, who have administrative responsibility for the condign
punishment of virus hackers, will not have the benefit of the most
current legal and ethical thinking on this matter.  At most, the
discussion should be cross-posted to both groups.  It is true that
it raises the noise level of this group considerably, but this group
contained a high level of opinions, flames, and assorted nonsense
before the advent of this hacker discussion.

I believe that the micros, at least those that have no user-system
differentation, like the PC and MAC, but unlike the microvax
do have an inherent flaw.  With these simpler systems, any code can do
anything.  Any program can wipe out the disk, change any file etc.

With the more sophisticated system (microvax), there is a user and a
system space, and the only way to affect system space is to be running
as a manager.  Of course we have seen how these systems can be
infected, but it requires a combination of errors, not just one, and
the careful user/manager can watch the system and keep it safe.

I'm not sure I understand this.   Any environment in which a user
has normal write-access to executable files that other users have
normal execute-access to can become thoroughly infected with a virus.
It doesn't require any "errors" at all.

Traditional protection mechanisms can certainly make it easier
for people writing anti-virus software (because, for instance,
if the anti-virus code is in a protected kernal, no user-run
virus can turn it off), but by itself it doesn't do much to
slow viruses down at all.  In multi-user systems, where users
typically use lots of "goodies" owned and updated by other
users, I would maintain that a virus could spread *faster*
than in a loosely-linked collection of single-user micros.
See Fred Cohen's "Computer Viruses -- Theory and Experiments"
for some confirmation of that...

My point was that if you are working in an environment where you may
log in as a user with limited priviledges, then you may establish one
"user" and run as him while you are testing software.  If the system
will not permit writing to a file without updating its last used date,
then you can see what files were affected, and if you cannot write
outside of the test directory, then you may be sure that no changes
occurred except in that area.

When done, the space can be cleaned.

In an unprotected system, no such security is possible.

Of course, if the virus is clever enough, then you can continue to use
it and then you may well find that the infection will reach as far as
you can reach.  That continued use is the "error" that I referred to
above.

This reminds me of an old Trojan Horse (not really a virus) which hit
some school (I forget which) many many moons ago. A student wrote a program
(some kind of useful tape utility) and submitted it to the systems people who
liked it a lot, installed it amongpublic utilities and used it heavily. Now,
the program, in addition to being a very useful tape utility, checked the date
and user's privilegesevery time it was run; and when it was run by one of
the priveleged usersafter the student graduated, it did some nasty things
to the entire system.
I guess there's a moral to it: if you can't trust the source of the program,
no amount of testing with user privs will help.

Re sysops locking out alleged hackers: if you use your mainframe account for
course-related work, and you don't do anything illegal, and systems people
interfere with your work (e.g. lock out your account, erase your files, etc)
the proper procedure is to SUE. There was a case about 2 years ago when a
CUNYVM operator nologged a student he did not like. The student sued (the
operator, not CUNY) and recovered the tuition for his computer course plus
computer usage fee plus damaged plus legal fees.
In my opinion, a systems person who does things like this is no better than
a virus (Trojan) writer. I conjecture that they have similar personality
traits.

I have to (really) disagree with the notion that mini's and larger are
safer that MAC and PC types.  Sure, with priv.s the system has a bit
more security, but remember why that is so...  Two people use the MAC
in our classics lounge.  Over 100 people use our Honeywell Multics
machine on good days.  On our suns and vaxes, the load isn't as much
but there are over 200 students relying on these networked machines.
Now the ration of two people losing a few files compared to two hundred
people makes virus (especially worms) more dangerous on mainframes &
mini's.

Note 1:  On the sun, priv.s don't mean too much.  They are easy to
bypass if the "true hacker" (no flames please) writes the virus.
Most UNIX machines are designed to be open, thus the question
"why have privs at all?"

Note 2:  Different tangent, when talking with WHMurray in private mail,

I don't know much about the internals of such things like laser printers, etc.,
but the idea seems sound...you could have one sitting off somewhere in memory
, or maybe have it infect a driver that would trash font loads or refuse to
accept them from the main machine,etc.  People have done it with clock/calendar
memory and even a first generation LaserJet is a lot smarter than that, so why
not peripherals??

Why even limit it to printers???...how 'bout a modem??---We just got a whole
bunch of new modems that have NO DIP switches, its all programmed from the
software....sounds like prime breeding ground to me!...theres got to be enough
memory in there to copy a whole command set which means there might also be
enough to house a virus.  Maybe something to echo a character or hangup or
something every x # of bytes transferred.

I don't claim to be a hardware expert, so pardon me if I screwed up and keep
your flame thrower holstered..

Most peripherals, particularly modems, provide no code segment space for
host writing; printers and some modems allow the host to install 'data'
on them.  The nature of the data used for these peripherals -- fonts,
protocols, et al. -- is not rich enough to provide for self-replicating
code, or even damaging code.  In general, the worst a program could do
with a laser printer is install a bad font, which would be stomped if
a good font got loaded on top of it.  With a modem, the host could
define a bad protocol; this also would be temporary.  While there may
be peripherals where virus infection is possible, they are few and
far between, from what I've seen.  (Try infecting your accounting
package with a data file.  Not easy; usually impossible.)

Drivers, on the other hand, can be infected, but this occurs on the
host machine, not on the peripheral.

     The Apple LaserWriter uses PostScript.  PostScript is a complete
programming language.  The LaserWriter has a *significant* amount of memory
on board, like a meg or two (I seem to remember it being a meg when I
worked with one in 1986).  I can very easily imagine a virus written in
PostScript infecting a LaserWriter.

     Wrong.

     On an unprotected system (i.e. single-user micro) one does this:

     1. Archive the hard file or write-protect it (physically disconnect it
        from the system if necessary).
     2. Put the suspect program on a *copy* of one of your working disks.
     3. Run the program as much as you want.
     4. Compare the disk copy to the original.
     5. Compare the hard file archive to the current contents, if
        practical.
     6. If any files have been modified that should not have been, then you
        have a virus (or a buggy program).

     This is actually *more* secure than the multiuser scenario you
described.  In your scenario a virus could be sensitive to restricted
environments and not do anything nasty until run in a 'target-rich'
environment.  In mine it is running on what appears to be an ordinary
working system.

     My scheme is beatable also, in several ways.  But the user privs and
suchlike do *not* give the protected multi-user system more security than
the unprotected single-user variety.

Mainframe peripherals often have a very rich instruction set.  As an
example, tape drives are firmware-controlled and are basically
computers, hence indeed subject to viral infection.  We had a case once
in which we lost the firmware in a tape drive and it kept a $3M computer
off the air until we figured out how to put the firmware back in (via a
card reader of all things...)  so the loss of a peripheral in some cases
could be quite serious.

Which was sort of my original point, particularily with regards to laser
printers.  I'm a big TeX and LaTeX nut myself and it gobbles memory for
breakfast, and since the peripheral is the point here, PC or mainframe isn't
really that much of an issue. So, not only do you have a big huge chunk of
memory, but you've got something thats actually portable too...e.g. if you're
writing it in something like TeX or Postscript, you've got something that
can live in both a PC and multi-user environment, since the original code is
based on a standardized version(This is true at least w/ TeX...I've used an AT
to TeX out files when our VAX's LN03 was down of the software it was programmed
in.   Hows that for migration possibilities???
As for wiping it out on the next font load, don't most lasers have a chunk of
memory reserved specifically for default or standard fonts that are always
available, even when not switched on???

You don't even need a mainframe, or even a large PC to be able to infect a
peripheral.  All it takes is a C-64.  The 1541 disk drive had a bank of 4k of
RAM and its own 6502. One method of copy protection used to be to write a small
part of the protection scheme into that area, and then have the loader check
for it, if it wasn't there, it'd assume a copy and freeze up.  A little off the
track there, but nevertheless a good example of what you can do with a little
space and some clever programming.

LaserWriter users should remember that the LaserPrep file is downloaded
to the LaserWriter prior to any printing. It would be possible to install
a Trojan Horse in this code quite easily. With the new LaserWriter NTX,
it might be possible to store this code on the machine's hard drive.
Anyone know whether this is possible?

As far as a virus, however, you would have to have a file-access mechanism
in place to actually spread this virus back from the LaserWriter to the
host machine. On top of this, the virus would need to be able to find out
what kind of machine it is trying to infect. Does AppleTalk have such a
call?

In general, IMHO, I think you might have to watch out for Trojan PostScript,
but probably not viral PostScript. Are there any AppleTalk aficionados or
PostScript hackers out there who can tell us more?

make and forgot was this: what's the point?  Most of the time, stuff
gets downloaded to the printer.  Now a virus can infect it all it likes,
but it's gonna get wiped as soon as the printer is turned off.  (There's
no reason for page memory to be non-volatile.  In fact, quite the con-
trary.)  I mean, what's it going to infect?  There's just the one
program; all a virus could really do is hang your printer until you
power-cycle it.  And there are plenty of other ways to hang a printer.
As far as printers are concerned, what's the practical difference
between writing a virus and writing a non-terminating Postscript program?
It's not clear to me what the virus-writer would achieve by writing
a virus for a printer.  However, a Postscript virus would have a larger
breeding ground; it could infect other Postscript files when a host
previewer gets run on it.  And in NeWS, there are lots more possibil-
ities, since NeWS is Postscript driven (+X11).

Another thing that is unclear to me is how a virus could infect
peripheral firmware.  (Unless it was there when the firmware was
produced.)

        There are certain symbiotic relationships between device drivers,
        cpus, and peripherals that might make an infection more viable
        than it first appears. For example, some classes of device drivers
        allow a terminal to execute any program via an escape sequence
        followed by a command code and the programs name and parameters.
        This was a particular philosophy for dynamically reconfiguring
        device characteristics. Combine this with say, a programmable
        printer, which when prompted with a sequence from the host to
        identify printer type, sends the string with an escape sequence
        and a destructive procedure call, or a modem which has this
        same string defined as a setup sequence. While it is true that
        many hardware devices use RAM memory only for data, there are
        contexts ala von nuemann where data can become instruction.

        Perhaps the caveat is something Korzybski used to say,
         "You can never say everything there is to say about anything"

Hi folks,
as mentioned correctly by some people there seems to be no way
to write a virus that is able to spread back to the computer and
its storage devices. But there is another problem with PostScript
printers: You can damage a PostScript printer by programming it in
the wrong way so that you have to send it in to the producer. So it
is possible to write a virus that can find out if a PostScript printer
is installed and than damages the printer by programm (I don't want
to elaborate on this, but it is possible). As far as I know *no*
anti-virus programm prevents this...
All the best,
Bernd.

        I certainly hope that the attitude of "don't discuss it and nobody
will do it" is not common in this discussion.  Has avoiding sex ed in this
country decreased the number of adolescents who engage in sex?  No.  All
it's done is given us a higher pregnancy rate than our European friends
such as Sweeden, France, etc.  If it didn't work in this case, what makes
anyone think it will work as far as computer viruses are concerned?  Give
people the best information possible so they can combat viruses.  If someone
is talented and malicious, they don't need the subscribers of this list for
their ideas.  They'd be perfectly capable of writing a virus on their own.

How embarassing.

Dan Hankins makes a very good point here.  There is no difference in
the level of protection between the two systems for anyone who has
systemic authority in a secure environment.  For the low level user,
however, there is less to worry about on the protected system with
respect to his own errors, more with respect to errors of the
administrator.

Let me lick my wounds and work on this some more.

I can see that you are from the land of Unix, where hosts and printers
have a master/slave relationship. But on Apple Talk each node has a
peer to peer relationship. Thus, a LaserWriter, with appropriate virus
code, could act like a fileserver with infected programs.

>ala von neumann, where data can become instruction...

In some sense, data is ALWAYS instruction.  That is, 'data' defines the
control flow of some virtual machine defined and modeled by the 'code'.
Simple example: grep; data is a program saying to print out lines that
conform to certain restrictions.  This semantic model of programs as
machines holds for any program, though it gets obscure in many cases.

However, the main question is: does the language of the 'data' provide
adequate semantics to alter other 'programs'?  In some circumstances,
the answer is yes.  Grep output, when piped through another grep,
becomes another program with different output.  Compiler input becomes
a program that can run directly on the target machine.  Both are forms
of 'data' that can actuate control of the machine.

Now given the idea of interactive, very smart peripherals, one can
analyze whether the controls initiated by the peripherals are adequate
for modifying the GENERAL behavior of some unrelated program.  This
essentially qualifies as virus infection, particularly if the modified
behavior includes modification of further programs' behavior.  If,
however, the semantics of the peripheral control only allow damage or
reprogramming of other peripherals, especially in a one-way fashion,
it is more like Trojan damage.  And the latter may require host program
modification in order for it to occur.

But this note is getting kind of dull.

I'm fuzzy on how that would work.  Are you suggesting the LaserWriter
will reach out and infect other networked computers without being
asked?  If so, what protocols will enable it to do this?  If not,
why would any computer ask a LaserWriter for executable code?

The only drives I'm aware of which have the ability to change speed without
adjusting a potentiometer are Apple's 3.5" drives.  Even those drives
(for the Apple ][ series), while programmable I don't believe can adjust their
own speed via software.  As for hard drives with the capability to have their
speed adjusted, I know of none.

I have no idea about the possibilities of this concerning minis or mainframes.

By the same token, tho, wouldn't the same thing be accomplished by having the
drive do a series of random seeks?  Depending upon the drive, or the user,
this is something which might not be immediately noticed and would cause
undue wear on the drive.

Dear fellows,
please be reasonable. There is no way a softwareproduct can influence
the rotational speed of a hard disk neither on a PC nor on a greater machine.
There is a possibility to change the speed of the 1.2MB Floppy on an AT, but
it can only set one of two speeds and not some completely different value.
All we have to deal with is the software side, and this is bad enough.

It's possible that the person who brought this subject up wasn't
referring to rotational speed.  I remember in my CP/M days that the
operating system could be configured for a particular track-to-track
seek time since some drives were slower than others.  The default, if
memory serves me correctly, was 30 ms and could be bumped down to 6 ms
for faster drives - that made one hell of a difference in the drive
speed.  As I recall, these numbers were dependent on the floppy disk
and the disk controller's firmware.  That is, 29 ms is not a valid
time, but 30 is.  Nonetheless, setting a drive up for 6 ms when it
couldn't quite keep up with that speed could conceivably make the
drive very unhappy.  I don't think that this would cause hardware
damage, though, only seek errors on the drive.

Let us not become too cool here.  It is possible for example for
software to damage some (older fashioned) crt devices by changing
sweep rates, it is not an unreasonable question to ask about other
tuneable phenomena.  I agree that I am unaware of any disk drive that
has its speed tunable, but I do not believe that this is not either
possible or beyond comprehension.  As hardware becomes more
sophisticated, the capabilities may well become available.

I do recall in the old days (~8 years or so ago) we had a DEC 10 that
ran tops 10 and you could crash disk heads by forcing the heads to
seek from the inside to the outside tracks at a certain frequency. If
there was a minimal amount of other seeks this would crash the disk.

No, I am not suggesting that. What I meant was that the LaserWriter would
mask out the real file-server and that Macs would execute code from
the LaserWriter that was acting like their "safe" file-server.
    Now that I think about it, this would be a really neat use of
the new NTX with a hard disk ( not to distribute virus code but just
act like a file-server! :-).

On the off-chance that you haven't had enough of virus reports, here's
another one from Computing Australia, 17th October, 1988:

``HK consultants hit by overseas virus

  A leading firm of financial consultants has become the first main-
  stream business in Hong Kong to be affected by a computer virus.
  The Business International consultancy reported last week the "Brain"
  virus -- well-known elsewhere in the world, but never before seen
  in Hong Kong -- had appeared on some disks.  ...  BI was playing down
  the significance of the find last week, with a company spokeswoman
  saying the virus had not reappeared and that no data had been lost.''

The article goes on further to discuss the origin of the Brain virus,
and makes the amazing observation "[it] does not destroy data, but
scrambles it beyond recognition".  I dunno, I would certainly regard
data "scrambled beyond recognition" as being "destroyed".

 I do recall an instance of a Trojan horse on the old TRS-80 Model I,
 which would do a series of random, long distance seeks on floppy
 drives. The drives in question, if left unattended, as many BBS
 machines were, would eventually overheat and in several
 cases, began to smolder. Disk drive technology has improved
 considerably since then, but so has the instance of
 unattended operation of PC's.

Subject:      kill that drive!

  On the subject of damaging disk drives, a couple months ago I read
(I think in Computers & Society Digest) about a prank you could play
with drives; you figure out a good resonant frequency for the drive,
then make the head(s) seek at just that rate.  The drive starts vibrating
(relatively) violently, enough so that it creeps across the floor,
possibly unplugging itself and certainly puzzling the operators in
the morning!
  I believe that this referred to mainframe drives, but it has interesting
possibilities for micros as well; if you could make a drive vibrate
for long enough you might be able to throw it out of alignment or
something evil like that...

Regarding the software destruction of drives...some of the PC disk diagnostics
can approach what seems to be a self destructive mode.  When running the seek
test, the drive does indeed start to vibrate and becomes rather loud.  I
suppose that a virus inplanted in an unattended machine could do the same.  I
have never had enough courage to run this test more than once every so often. I
don't know what would happen if the drive were continuously run this way.  I
can't imagine it would be very good for it.

The FDC on IBM PC and clones has a parameter called 'head unload time'.
BIOS sets it to a conservatively high value; MS DOS 2.0 and later
resets it to a lower value. Soon after DOS 2.0 came out, some people
figured that they can make their drives operate faster by setting it
lower yet; and it did, but the affected drives went out of alignment
withina few month. I don't see why this was referred to as 'virus',
though. (Although, this certainly is a technique that a virus or a
Trojan horse could use to damage the machine).

Just to add a little fuel to the virus/hardware damage thread, I'd
like to point out that it is supposedly possible to fry a monitor,
on the Atari ST system, by forcing the computer into the incorrect
mode.  In other words, if you have a monochrome monitor hooked up
the hardware will detect this and adjust the sync rate of the
computer to match.  But it is supposedly possible to "trick" the
computer, via software, into thinking that a color monitor is
being used.  Evidently the differing sync rates of the two monitors
will cause permanent damage if this occurs.

I'm not a software developer, and I'm no hardware wizard.  I'm sure
the concept is correct but don't flame me for saying zig would I
should have said zag.  Polite corrections are welcome.
I imagine the concept could apply to other systems as well.

If I'm not mistaken, on the old IBM monochrome monitors one could (and someone
did) write code (I can't recall if it was a virus, trojan horse, or what), that
altered the scan rate on the screen, and if this was allowed to continue, it
could heat the monitor up to the point where it could (and on occasion did)
burst into flames.  I wish I could recall this a little better than I do,
I can't even remember the specific monitor.  Anyone else out there read/hear/

I think I have to clear up a few things about my remark on "no way to
influence the hardware". What I feel the danger of a virus is, that
something goes on which can not be stopped until it's to late. This
can happen (on the hardware side) by changing the seek time of a drive
to a value which influences its performance over time. The other
possibilities, i.e. bringing the heads in a resonance status or frying
the monitor (you can do the same on a Hercules card), would not be
unnoticed by the people in front of the screen. If you have a BBS or
something else running unobserved, thats of course another story.

        Remember the Commodore Pet?  It was made back around 1977.  Referencing
a certain memory location made the 6502 run at 2 Mhz (I think) instead of
1 Mhz.  The only drawback was that
1. the machine was unreliable at that speed, and
2. on certain models of the Pet, doing so could fry certain chips.

When I worked for a company which sold PC's we burned them in before
delivery by stressing them as much as possible.  One of the things
we did to test drives was to run the diagnostics continuously
overnight.  It turned up some defective machines (which we returned)
but I don't remember the ones we sent on to our customers coming
back with problems in the drives at a higher rate than the machines
I fixed which we had not burned in.

Based on this I conclude that the PC diagnostic seek test is
non-destructive (despite the noise).  If anyone has any actual
experience to the contrary PLEASE post it.

I've just received a word-of-mouth announcement that Aldus Corporation was

but they say that the virus was called nVir (?).  If anyone has any more

Also, the same announcement on Compuserve said that Carnegie Mellon University

on that one, though.  Does anyone have any more information on this?

The Compuserve message was dated today, 10/21/88.

A few years back, I remember hearing some acquaintances talking about a method
of "punishing" someone they didn't like -- they would give him copies of
pirated software which had the boot sector (or some such) changed so that when
he would boot the disk, the drive would be told to seek track 99.

On the old Commodore-64 drives, this caused the drive head to fall off the
glides, damage itself on the stops, or some equiavalent thereof -- in any case,
it ruined the drive.

Boy, I don't understand that at all. nVIR is a well-known Mac virus that
can be fought quite successfully with the "Vaccine" CDEV. If this is the
known strain of nVIR, Aldus isn't being very careful about viruses.

For those who know about nVIR, you may delete the rest of this message.

nVIR is a virus supposedly based on some assembler source which was
posted in CompuServe last year sometime. It follows standard spread
patterns (application -> system, system -> applications), but has a
few bugs. It doesn't check for a "killed" version of itself and does
not completely infect applications which have protected code resources.

Its "function" is to (on a 1-in-16 chance) say "Don't panic" if MacInTalk
is installed, and to beep if it isn't. The LISTSERV here at SCFVM has both
a program to remove it from your applications and a better explanation (in
the virus documentation stack). You must use ResEdit to get it out of your
System files.

Again, since source of sorts was available for this one, it may have been
modified to be more sophisticated and more agressive; it is also possible
that it has been made Vaccine-proof.
