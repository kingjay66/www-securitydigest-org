Subject:      What is a Worm?

Hi All,

Can someone please give me a good working definition of what a worm is?

                                                        Rob....
P.S.  Does anyone know if there is a more up to date version of the
      the Dirty Dozen list.

Subject: Morris again

I haven't heard anything lately; so what are they going to do with
poor Morris?  I feel for the poor man, he seems to be a very
intelligent individual who did not delibrately set out to destroy.

Is this a one day affair, or does it spread out? What are the topics of
discussion, if any?

Yes, he could have easily done all the work as far as assembling the
virus is concerned.  At a talk held here on viruses (and worms), it
was explained that researchers send code (like efficient crypt()
routines) to each other quite often.  So Morris could have easily
gotten bits of code from various innocent collegues and patched them
together.  Also 9 times the speed of a BSD crypt() may not be all that
fast since BSD crypt() is designed to run slowly to prevent brute
force password breaking.

Subject:  nVIR Strikes Again (Macintosh)

I was informed today that one lab at the University of Calgary (a
Macintosh lab used by Graduate Students, Professors, and
Undergraduates) has been infected by nVir.  One of the professors
noticed his applications crashing on a regular basis, did some
snooping around, and found nVir.  It was apparently given to us from
some guests that visited the campus after attending a Conference held
by some members of the U of C faculty.  The infection has not caused
any loss of data, and has apparently been eradicated through the use
of some program called NPW Tools or some such (has anyone else heard
of this program?  If so, please fill me in on it).

Thought you might like to hear some good news for a change instead of
another report of infection and loss of data.

Subject:  Virus information files

There have been many recent requests for info on viri.  I have
announced this before, but ... well here goes.

I have, and am willing to distribute, about 2 meg of info on viri and
related "security breaking" programs.  Note: info.  I am not willing
to distribute the viri themselves.

The bulk of this is messages from RISKS-FORUM, INFO-IBMPC, INFO-MAC,
VIRUS-L and Computers and Society.  I have recently been editting them
into separate subject files; FUNCTION, HISTORY, CONTACTS, OPINION,
RELATED and DEFinition.

*I WILL NOT MAIL 2 MEG FILES OVER THE NET!* And ubc doesn't support
FTP.  Send a sufficient number of disks (PC 360K/5 1/4 or 720K/3 1/2)
with a self addressed *CANADIAN* stamped mailer to:

 North Vancouver, B. C.

Amongst the reports: the CHRISTMA EXEC, a report of an Apple DOS 3.3
virus from 1982, the use of intelligent terminals as "virus" vectors,
Lehigh, Israeli, and BRAIN MS-DOS viri, nVIR and SCORES mac viri etc.
etc.

Next, history, help, etc.?
