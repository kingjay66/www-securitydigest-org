It is my understanding that as of early August, Ross Greenberg (the author
of FluShot+) was working on a new version, which at that time was in beta test.

Any versions prior to that have numerous bugs, as has been outlined previously
in this forum.

My verion of FluShot Plus is dated 7-13-88, and I have been using it
in my system daily since about 7-18-88. There are only two bugs
that *I* have caught so far, neither of which are fatal, but just
annoying. The first deals with reading and writing to a floppy drive (in
my AT clone, I set the option to check CMOS, and FSP_14 warns me that CMOS
is being changed - why? I don't know.), and the second problems is a "whole"
in FSP_14's protection that lets protected files be read and modified with
unstandard text editors.

send out copies to whoever might want one, including
notes we'll take from each lecture and discussion we
can.

I can't quote a price yet, we'll need to know exact
printing costs (although I can come close) and shipping.
I'll get that to you probably a few days before the
conference, but it is helpful for me if you send me

Subject:      re: legislation on viri

There have been questions in this list concerning laws pertinent to
virus writing and implanting, and related issues.  This contribution
tries to give an answer for the Federal republic of Germany.
As I'm no lawyer, and English isn't my mother tongue, you'll probably
need much imagination to understand my attempts for proper translation
of the legal terms (this Cassel's Dictionary doesn't serve its purpose,
either).

Paragraph (+) 303 of our Penal Code deals with Damage to Property.
After this paragraph, there have been inserted two more paragraphs,
effective from 1 Aug 1986:

  + 303a Alteration of Data:
  (1) Who illegally deletes, suppresses, renders useless, or alters Data
      (cf. +202a, sect. 2), will be punished with up to two year's impri-
      sonment or with a fine.
  (2) The attempt is punishable.

  + 303b Computer-Sabotage:
  (1) Who disturbs data processing that is of significant importance
      to some outside firm or some public authority by ways of
      1. an act according to +303a sect. 1    or
      2. destroying, damaging, rendering useless, removing, or
         altering some data processing unit or some data recording
         medium,
      will be punished with up to five year's imprisonment or a fine.
  (2) The attempt is punishable.

Implanting a virus into a program on someboy else's computer or diskette
means changing data, illegally, and hence clearly is subsumed under
+303a sect. 1.  Putting into circulation a Trojan Horse that is meant
to implant some virus, clearly is subsumed under +303a sect. 2.
In both cases, +303a is applicable even if no damage has been caused.

+303b sect. 1 nr. 1 heightens the punishment for qualified cases of
Alteration of Data, whilst +303b sect. 1 nr. 2 does the same for
qualified cases of Damage to Property.  The latter will seldom apply
to viri -- only if a virus damages the screen (which can be done by
faulty or malicious programming of the CGA or EGA cards, as I've been
told) or other hardware.

In any case, it'll be difficult -- if not impossible -- to hold somebody
responsible for virus-issuing.  E.g. we have evidence that the virus
we've found, recently, has been dwelling in some of our computers for
more than three months.  We surely will not be able to trace this
virus back to its originator!

I do not know what the term "illegally" in +303a means to lawyers.
Hopefully, a person spreading a virus unwittingly cannot be blamed
for "illegally altering data".

There is also a "Law on Protection from Improper Use of Person-Related
Data during Data Processing" (do not blame my translation: this is also
awful German :-), effective from 1 Jan 1978 (for data processing by
private persons, corporations, firms, and federal authorities) and
a couple of similar laws (for data processing by municipal, regional and
other authorities).

Here, I cannot discuss the whole law.  It pertains only to particulars
(no statistical aggregations) of individuals (no corporate bodies).
It covers every form of data processing, even manually processed
card-indizes.  According to this law, processing of personal data is
in principle forbidden (i.e. only allowed in special cases enumerated
by this or other laws).  One special case is consent of the person
refferred to ( and I take it for granted, that posting a note to
VIRUS-L implies everybody's consent to being refferred in every
subscriber's NOTEBOOK and NAMES files -- otherwise I'd be liable
for breaking this wonderful law :-)

Now for the implication of this law to virus-defeating:  according to
+6 (far too long to be quoted verbatim) technical and organizational
measures are to be taken to prevent unauthorized disemination or
alteration of person-related data.

Under this paragraph, a faculty member of our university had to give up
processing his reserch-data (which included criminal records and similar
data of real persons) on a personal computer.  Even if this computer was
kept in a locked room, it was considered too weak (subject to unautho-
rized and unnoticed manipulations) to bear such delicate personal data.
The research-project was delayed until a new and safe data processing
procedure (on a host) had been established.

So much for "security": word has spread even to lawyers in our country,
that there is *no* such thing as "Security on a Personal Computer"!

Best regards to everybody.  I agree, that you store my name, phone
number, and BITNET address on your computer with the object of
communication :-)

That works great...if you're on a VAX on BITNET running JNET, and
binary files can only be sent to another BITNET host using the above
method.  For the rest of us, however, that command will only generate
an error message.

To send a binary file via the networks, the (arguably) most universal
method is to uuencode the file and mail it to the other user(s).  The
recipient(s) would then uudecode the file back into its original
binary form.

I've been meaning to get onto Ross Greenburg's bboard and pick up his
latest version of FSP (I believe 1.4 or 1.5).  When I get it, I'll
make the file available via the LISTSERV here at Lehigh.  (Please don't
send me the file, I'll get it directly from Ross to assure that it's
the latest version.)

  I haven't heard of an actual virus which does this, but not long ago I re-
ceived an interesting program called PROVECRC, distributed by Chuck Gilmore of
Gilmore Systems, CA, which is supposed to demonstrate what a virus *could* do
in this respect.  Given any input file (25 to 32000 bytes long), this program
produces another file of the same size which, though different in content, is
supposed to have the same CRC.  The moral is supposed to be that "CRC checking
alone is inadequate for file modification detection."
  Obviously, Gilmore's program could not possibly succeed against *arbitrary*
generating polynomials; he would have to know the actual generator, or at least
know that the generator was one of a certain small set of polynomials.  The
evidence shows that he assumes a specific 16-bit generator.
  In order to test his program, I ran PROVECRC on a small file.  As promised,
the modified file which was created had the same size, date and time as the
original file.  But when I computed the CRC of each of the two files using one
of the CRC programs at my disposal, the CRCs were *different*.  The same thing
happened when I tried another CRC program.  Presumably, they don't use the same
generator as Gilmore assumed.
  By comparing the files, I discovered that what PROVECRC does is as follows:
Let n be the size of the file.  Then it replaces the (n-19)th through (n-11)th
bytes of the file by the string '*altered*' and twiddles the (n-10)th and
(n-9)th bytes so as to yield the same CRC as the original file (relative to
whatever generator he was assuming).
  I repeated the experiment with other program files, getting the same results
with respect to CRCs.  It is not surprising that in some cases the modified
versions of the programs performed exactly as the original programs did, since
for many executable files the actual program ends considerably before the nth
byte, so that PROVECRC had enough room to modify bytes without affecting exe-
cution.  Of course, actual viruses that perform destructive actions would gene-
rally take up more space than is available in such a "gap".
  But what most aroused my curiosity about PROVECRC was this:  After an initial
message giving the "actual" CRC of the file, one gets the message "NOTE: Up
to 65,535 passes may take place!"  The actual number of passes depends somehow
on the particular file, though it's not a function of the size of the file.  In
any case, each pass takes about 1/65 of a second on the 4.77 MHz PC I was using.
But what precisely was the program doing all this time and what constitutes a
"pass"?  Given that the program (thinks it) knows the generator and the corres-
ponding CRC of the file, I don't think it should take that much time to figure
out what 16 bits should replace the (n-10)th and (n-9)th bytes.  (I considered
the possibility that the mention of passes was merely a coverup for some time-
consuming Trojan or viral activity, but I found no indication of it.)
  So does anyone out there have any idea whether there's a legitimate reason for
such a program to take so much time, and what a "pass" might consist of?  (If
anyone's interested in taking this program apart, I'll be glad to e-mail it to
him.)

  As Jerry Leichter replied, modification with preservation of size can be
performed without crashing the program if the virus writer concentrates his
attack on specific files whose content is known to him in advance.  But I wish
to add another point:  Any self-respecting program to compare checksums of
files will also compare their *sizes*.  (And there are some programs which no-
tify you of size changes even though they don't compute any checksum.)  There-
fore a virus creator has a better chance of his modification going undetected if
he avoids altering the file size.

  I suspect that when the authors spoke of "four versions of the Israeli virus",
they meant to say "four Israeli viruses".  And I can assure you, David, that
there really are (at least) that many.  I agree that using a binary editor to
change a string of text, or even to change the date the bomb is set to go off,
should not be considered as creating a new virus (although the latter could be
considered as a new "version" of the same virus since it changes the *behavior*
in an essential way).  But the two viruses discovered in Israel whose target
date is April Fools Day are sufficiently distinct from the Friday-the-13th virus
and from each other that they deserve to be considered as separate viruses.
(The fourth virus is admittedly very similar to the main Friday-the-13th virus
and maybe should be considered as another version of the same virus, but if I'm
not mistaken, even it differs by more than mere binary editing.)
