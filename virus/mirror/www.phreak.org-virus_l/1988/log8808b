David Slonosky's idea of a virus concealing itself is quite interesting, but
there is a reason I don't think it could work.

To really hide, the virus would have to remember the code it was overwriting.
Otherwise, finding a chunk of $00s or No-ops in the middle of your code would
be pretty suspicious (unless you're looking at COMMAND.COM :-)

Anyway, while we all know of the CS1001 problem "write a program that prints
itself", this is not that simple. It can't easily print (what's supposed to
be) itself since it has no place to put it. It could of course find some
spare sectors on the disk, but how is it going to keep from overwriting info
kept by another copy of itself? It would have to keep its own directory. How
can it prevent DOS from using its sectors (which are free, as far as DOS
knows)?  It would have to infect DOS.

Etc.
Etc.
Etc.

The point is, this virus rapidly grows so complex that it couldn't hide. The
original copy would be huge, and it would have a significant effect on the
system.

Of course, this brings up the nightmareish possibility of a program like this
running on a mainframe with enough power that its overhead wouldn't be
noticed (or it could doctor CPU usage tables while it was at it...). The only
protection against this is the fact that the innards of the OS are protected
on mainframes. However, if a superuser (or whatever) was dumb enough to run
the necessary trojan...

Yuck.

Someone recently advocated the teaching of "viral hygiene" to joe average
computer user while keeping "virus writing" to the experts ( a poor paraphrase,
but it gets the point across). This is the wrong attitude. Viruses are a
part of the current computing environment, so are worms, trojans, etc...
Educating users in prevention is necessary to stem the amount of damage done
by these destructive programs. However, if the future computing environments
are going to be better, computer diseases 101 had best be taught. The field
of computing is growing at an incredible rate and in this growth, nowhere do
we see a system completely foolproof. Why not? Because the system designers
didnt know about the various kinds of computer diseases. The CIS students
of today will be tommorows programmers, educating them now about how virii
work, detection schemes, security controls and pitfalls, will in the long
run make virus writing something undertaken only by a few experts, instead
of the situation we have now where combatting viruses is undertaken by only
a few experts and every joe hacker on the street can create a virus for
the expert virus hunters to track down.

Subject:      Flushot Plus 1.4

I have not been subscribing to the Virus List lately, but since I
had a question concerning Ross Greenberg's Flushot Plus 1.4, I figured
someone here might have an answer for me. Please carbon replies to me.

I have an AT-clone and have always tried the Flushot programs (and as I
figured out by losing my CMOS memory) - they did me no good.  Anyway,
I've been using version 1.4 (which was released July 13, 1988) and
haven't had any problems (fatal) until today.  While using Procomm Plus
Test Drive v.1.1 my computer rebooted without me touching any keys.  I
wondered what was going on, and it rebooted several times.  The only
change in my system is that now I have FSP14 running.  Has anyone else
experienced similar problems? (I am unsure that FSP is the culprit, but
have eliminated all other possibilities.)

One other question that I have concerns my CMOS memory.  I have FSP
checking my CMOS, and it doesn't erase it like the last version, but WHY
when I boot off my hard disk and try to read a floppy does it warn me
that "CMOS IS BEING WRITTEN TO"??? Should reading a floppy disk have any
effect on CMOS, or is this another annoying bug in Ross's program?

Please forward any comments to DAB3@LEHIGH.   Thank you,

BIOS is, in fact, reentrant. The TSR would not
need to rely on any of these services, however, it would merely
check interrupt vectors in memory for modifications.

You are right about the clock ticks; if you reset the value
time might get a little twisted, however, I believe you can also
employ Channel 2, normally used for the speaker, but maybe 18.2 would be
the resolution you are stuck with.

This tactic was really another approach to intercepting a virus which
relies on obtaining control from system interrupts. Its utility would
be its function in a more comprehensive strategy.

Only if you expose yourself to them.  If you don't try out stuff from

But not every user has to take it!  Give us a break.  How much does even
a Medical College graduate know about the life cycle of Rift Valley Fever?
How much does the average person need to know about how colds operate?
Sure, thay should know what viruses are, and how you can't treat a virus
with antibiotics, but they shouldn't have to be taught in detail about
each of the 127 or more diseases we call colds.  It would be useless
information to the average person, and a waste of time.
   Similarly with computer viruses and Trojan Horses, etc.:  most users
should be aware that such things exist, and know enough about how they
work to have a chance of recognizing one when they see its tracks.
They should learn some simple rules of hygiene, like using write protect
tabs and using a floppy-based system to fool with some RUNME.EXE they
just downloaded, if they must try such things at all.
   Anyone who likes to try out new stuff, to be a pioneer, should know
more, like how to install and use some virus detection software.
   Only a few people should have to learn the nitty, gritty details of
how nasty programs accomplish their nefarious tasks, and how to write
countering programs.  THE REST OF US HAVE BETTER THINGS TO DO!
   Don't get me wrong.  I'm fawningly grateful to you good guys on this
list who have chosen (?) to get involved deeply in the struggle.  But
the computer work of the world is not going to slow down much because
of viruses.  Susceptible machines, networks, and personal habits will
gradually be replaced by safer ones, as a direct result of temporarily
"successful" attacks on our software integrity.  The average computer
user can almost go right on doing what she's doing now.

Let's not confuse the average user with either CIS students or system
designers.  CIS students should learn what you say they should learn,
yes, but not more than that.  They should also know that it is relatively
easy to write a virus, that it is a rotten, unethical thing to do, that
it can get you ten years in jail and a ruined financial life, that most
viruses can be detected and traced back to their origins if some Sherlock
gets on the trail in time.  Those who like the idea of being Sherlocks
can be encouraged to learn more if they want.  Most of us think it more
fun and challenge to be on this side of the contest, anyway.
   Average users should hardly have to learn or do anything but run the
one to three applications they want to use.  They have work to do.
Most of them have a friend who knows about systems and software, whom
they trust to let them know when something useful comes along.  This
is the way things are, and should be.  Those of you closely involved
with this list--I love you, but don't overstate the need for everyone
to join in your enthusiasm.  Virus etc. outbreaks have not affected the
average user yet, and may not ever.  (Thanks to you!)

Subject:      Hiding viruses


The solution is simple. Just print data from another sector, or, possibly a
small random-number generator. Binary files look all the same....

Does anyone seriously believe that a virus writer is going to bother with such
an esoteric scheme to hide their code? We haven't seen any so far. The
reason is that your joe blow computer user just doesn't look at his boot
sectors very often, and the only reason anyone else would is if strange
things started happening.

Viruses have to be small to avoid being obvious. If COMMAND.COM suddenly
grows by 30k due to all of the CRC foolers and other wild schemes, even
joe blow may notice it.


On another tack, anyone have any ideas on the possible future of viruses?

The other I got ahold of a book called ``Advanced 80386 Programming''
(sorry, author's name is gone). At very least, Intel has designed
one heck of a complicated microprocessor. Since the beast is designed
specifically for multi-tasking, there are all kinds of wierd things
like ``call-gates'' that allow use of privileged subroutines by
low-privilege processes, without giving privileges.

I suppose a virus could still call the dos's ``FORMAT HARD DISK'' command,
but it seems kind of stupid to provide such an easily accessible command
in the first place.

Subject:      Gerbil / Virus Course

Well, I was away from my computer for all of two days (my
wife is trying to make me cut down) and 200 messages built
up on various systems.  Thank you for all your responses on
the conference, and please keep them coming.

First, the Gerbil virus.  These viruses have been the
source of a lot of confusion over the past few months.
I believe someone stated a while back on this list something
about an MS-DOS virus that prints little feet across the
bottom of the screen and a message that goes along with
it.

I have not seen hide nor foot of this virus.  A friend
out at the University of California, however, was able
to send me a similar program which they found on someone
ELSE's computer system.  Its a set of two programs that
runs on Vax systems running the VMS operating system.
The version I saw was appended at the end of the system
login file, so anyone logging in ran the program, unknown
to them.   This program would count the number of commands
a user would type in and after 35 of them (and every
multiple thereafter), would call a second program (also
written in the DCL command language) that would print
very crude "feet" across the bottom of the screen in
five lines.  They would use a variety of greater than,
less than signs and / \ marks.   No message was printed.

Whether or not this program had a third program which
would copy itself into the system login file is unknown
to me.  I doubt it.   It was most likely a prank by someone
at that company.  But this was the closest thing I could
find to the elusive gerbil virus talked about on this system.

What I DID find however, was a cute PC "virus" or "bacterium"
as I'm told they now call them, that when ran would print
a picture of Jerry Pentacoli  (I have no idea how to spell
that) and a Gerbil jumping from an end-table into him.
It then looked for (as do most of these picture viruses)
any other disks on the system (including a hard disk C:,
D: and so on) and copied itself to them.

I would suspect that all of these picture viruses are
written by the same person or group of people.  They
are interesting, but not damaging.

Les, Chris, as for a course on viruses,  I think that
is a bit too specialized for undergraduates, but I would
like to see a course given on computer security measures
and theories.  I don't know whether or not it should
be mandatory, because judging by some college's requirements
for a BS in computer science, many wouldn't know what
computer security WAS much less how to implement protection
schemes.

Unfortunately, "Computer Security" covers a very broad
range of ideas.  And perusing the books in our library
pertaining to computer security, each has an entirely
different subject in them.  I'd like to see courses
provided to computer science students that overview
some of the needs for computer security, including banks,
government agencies, the need for secrecy and so on,
what computer system administrators need to know,
and possibly some protection schemes, how banks
are protected, future developements in the field of
limited transitivity and limited usefulness, and touching
on the problems viruses pose as an advanced way around
most protection schemes and how we might slow down
or stop their spread.

Actually, I think it would be a challenging course to
teach... one I wouldn't mind teaching at all.

Forwarded from J.D. Abolins:

Re: Should computerists be told about computer viruses?

I believe the they should be told ENOUGH so they know that hazards exist and
that they know what to do to minimize risks. Tell them that there are problem
programs out in the world. Tell them about the need for accountability of
programs, the need for good backup procedures, and how to recognize a
damaged system.

This type of instruction shouldn't be viewed as VIRUS PREVENTION, rather it
should be given as holistic review of good computing practices. After all,
it is not just viruses that cause problems (although their replication makes
them particularly troublesome); there are Trojan Horses and genral bug-ridden
programs. So many of the practices to protect a system from viruses overlap
with preventatives for other problems.

One of the big dangers in not mentioning viruses at all is that the "innocent"
computerist will face getting hurt without even knowing tht the danger exists.
One of the big pitfalls they should know about, after being told simply that
replicating malicous code- viruses- do exist, is that programs they have
considered to be safe, such as commercial software they have bought, can
become an agent of damage if they are not careful in their use of the
program. "Borrow-ware", the practice of borrowing and lending out "known
to be reliable" programs, can catch the unwary. The copy of QDOS bought by
a computerist starts out being safe. But the computerist uses it on different
machines and over the useage, the copy of QDOS gets a virus code replicated
into it. If the computerist is not even aware of viruses, he/she will have
no idea that their "trusted program, bought with their own money" can be
the carrier of trouble.

Tell them, yes. Tell them just enough to know it is rough world out there and
tell them how to minimize their risks. Beyond that, the average computerist
need not hear how to make a viruse, their modes of attack, etc.

As for the debate about Fred Cohen's mention of viruses causing the virus
case at Lehigh, I agree with Ken that the issue is moot. (Anyway, it would
have probably someplace just as well without any course on viruses. After all
others have mentioned the concept and if Fred Cohen could conceive of the
possibility, so can many other people. But enough said.)

If you are subscribing for work (i.e. you're a security officer) you may
want to subscribe in the name of the company (2600 claims that they will
NOT EVER release the names of companies that subscribe). If you
subscribe using your own name there is a possibility that you may get on
some lists that you don't want to be on (this is PURE SPECULATION and is
based on my own paranoia, but being on such a list (i.e. "cracker list")
may not be very good if you are a security consultant and are looking
for work, the FBI has been known to keep such lists before and I don't
think there gona stop now.)

not so.  There is lots of room, just declare a few disk blocks to be
unavailable in the FAT, and use that space.  Noone looks to see what
happens to the bad block space, even of a floppy.

Subject:      Question about virus attacks

I have been reading your discussions with great interest. However, I
feel that very little has been said about viruses on VAX-11, Sun and
other generally-not-owned-by-private-persons computers. I am writing
a report on viruses here at Ellemtel in Sweden. I think it should
contain something about the viruses having hit a little larger machines.

My report will mostly contain a summation of what has been said about
viruses on this and other lists. It will not concentrate on PC viruses
and specific PC solutions. Instead it will be about viruses and protections
for the *general* micro/mini computer. Of special interest here is
the Unix environment, which is used in an increasing number of mini
computers today.

I would like to know about viruses, which have struck company computers.
I will respect that you don't want the name of your company to leak out
if you have been hit, but I would like to know what happened. Just tell
me it was some other company you can't recall the name of. I don't mind.
If you still aren't sure if you dare trust me with virus information, I
can let my superiors contact you.

I would also like to know what software there is to protect against
viruses. So far I have only run across TCELL. Has anyone had any
experience with this?

When finished, I will make my report available to Kenneth R. van Wyk,
so you all can download it.

Please e-mail all answers. I appreciate all the help I can get.

Subject:      Mainframe Viruses

Stephan,

We've been doing detailed work on mainframe viruses for some
time.  Most of the original work on viruses done by Fred
Cohen, etc was done on a variety of Unix machines and Vax's
if I remember correctly.

There have been a few virus attacks on mainframes.  One
in particular, a banking institution in northern New Jersey
was hit only 5 or 6 weeks ago.  Their name cannot be
released however.  The problem with most corporate attacks
and mainframe attacks is that they are sworen to secrecy.

IBM being hit by the Christmas Tree virus was one publicized
virus.

Most mainframe security systems are worthless against viruses
I am VERY sorry to say.

Again, not to plug myself, but Lehigh Valley Innovative Technologies'
Innoculator package is available for VM/CMS, VMS, Unix boxes (most
including Sun's).  And I believe there is another such package out
there, but I'l have to check on the name again.

It is very hard to attempt to stop virus attacks on mainframes,
but we're working on various ways of stopping them.

Subject:      Mainframe Viruses and whatnot

I hate to be such a nitpicker, but CHRISTMA wasn't really a virus
in the usual sense, since it didn't insert itself into any
executable files, but just sent itself (CHRISTMA EXEC) around
the net.   I think the distinction is rather important, since
it's Real Easy to write a filter that just zaps anything of
the right size called CHRISTMA EXEC, whereas it's typically
much harder to deal with a real, spreading, arbitrary-program-
altering, virusy virus.  (A word that seems to fit CHRISTMA
well is "bacterium".)

(The hacked FLUSHOT wasn't really a virus, either, as far as I
 know; it was just a Trojan Horse that did bad things to your
 system when you ran it.   It didn't spread itself.   I'd
 hate to see "virus" come to mean "something that does something
 bad to something".  Let's reserve it for, as Fred Cohen said,
 "a program that can 'infect' other programs by modifying them
 to include a possibly evolved copy of itself".)

Back to the subject: I think it'd be interesting if Loren (or
anyone else) could tell us some of the things that make virus-fighting
on mainframes harder than on micros (if I'm reading Loren's item
aright).   Anything you can tell us without exposing anyone's
dirty laundry?

Subject:      Mainframe problems


Well Dave,

The easiest thing for me to say is "The more complex the machine,
the harder it is to protect", but its more than that.  A micro, all
by itself is easier to protect than a network or than a lot
of computers in one room used by many people, and so on.

One of the problems with mainframes is the number of users, and the
possibility of very remote computer sites accessing the system.  Let
say, for example, that those using our example mainframe M get onto the
system by way of microcomputers.  Lets say someone "has it in" for this
company as well.  It is possible for someone to write a program which
attacks your companies modem program and gets itself to the mainframe
through it.  Because there is a large number of users of M, this
virus-modem program can spread from user to user and affect each part of
the mainframe, not just the parts a particular user has access to.

We have demonstrated this possible problem with Unix computers in
the past, having the virus "pick-up" privilages until it was able
to attack the entire machine.  This is a dangerous problem, and one
we cannot take lightly.

If a virus "blows up" on a mainframe, realize that we have the
possibility of losing data from many users, not just a single disk as is
the case with a single micro.

The problem, also, is that we cannot just CRC the entire machine.
People may be developing, someone is always changing around files, and
there are many places for viruses to hide on the system.  We have to
find a way to stop viruses from spreading on these machines without
limiting the machine to those programs "okay'd" by the administrator of
M.

We have looked at DER one-way-encryption protection of libraries of
machines, or creating a shell around the mainframe to "write protect"
files, or protecting certain programs and not others, or even limited
transitivity of the machine...  breaking it down into blocks that users
can access certain things but not everyone can get things from everyone
else.   Its a difficult problem.  We don't have the ease of making sure
DOS checking all writes before they write and watching for direct
writing.  With each mainframe, we must check carefully what is changing
and whether or not the user wants it to change.

Loren

One other thing that some collegues of mine just mentioned to
me:

It may be true that it is harder to write a mainframe anti
viral package than a micro av package, BUT its also generally
harder to write a virus for that system.

Our job isn't to create a virus-proof system, I don't believe
one exists... but what we can do is make the environment
harder and harder to attack, make the virus writer really
work to write a good virus, and make the number of people
who can write a virus to go oaround our systems so small
that no one does it.

Subject:      Mainframe


I wouldn't consider mainframes "harder" to protect than PC's just
"different".  A mainframe gives you a lot of advantages that you don't
have on a PC.  On the other hand, there is greater sharing of
resources on mainframes which makes viral spread more dangerous.

First of all, a mainframe (or mini for that matter) has a secure
Operating System.  You cannot address REAL memory and you cannot
access the I/O ports directly like on a PC.  Moreover, a virus has no
more priveledge over the OS than the invocing user.  Granted a virus
can climb the ladder, but it must do so through ordinary means; ie it
can't immediately write itself to the disk, or to the command
processor until it has priveledge to do so.  So a mainframe virus must
link itself to an ordinary executable to be able to get itself into
memory, replicate to other executables, and test to see if it has
enough priveledge to accomplish its pre-determined task.  Of course,
depending on the OS, a mainframe virus might be able to modify
a users local command processor so as to stay totally active during
the entire session (or even after the user logs out).  But the
virus only has the priveledge of the user.

Let's go over a quick example of how a virus might climb the ladder.
Suppose there are several users on a mainframe: Prof Smith, John,
Mary, Jim, System, and The_Rest.  Let's say that John, Mary and Jim
are in the professor's programming class and that Prof Smith has
priveledge over their accounts.  The user System has priveledge over
all accounts.  John decides to upload this great game to the system
(it happens to contain a virus).  He executes it and all his files
are subject to infection.  Mary executes the program too and
all her files become subject to infection.  The Professor
decides to check on Mary's work, so he executes one of her
programming assignments.  Well, this assignment was infected
so not only does the Prof. files become subject to infection
but Jim's files become infected as well.  Finally, the professor
just finished a software package.  He tells System that it's
ready to be installed.  System puts it in with the other system
files and executes it to make sure it was installed properly.
Now The_Rest of the system is subject to infection and the virus
has system priveledge.  It can do anything it wants!

There are ways to use mainframes security features to
their maximum advantage to try to prevent the above senario.
You could isolate the system from the outside world; however,
this is inadvisable since an ordinary user could write the
virus anyway.  You could isolate the users from one another
but this probably wouldn't be advisable especially considering
users often need to work together to complete a project.
The best method is probably to look for footprints that
indicate a possible virus about the system.

In a program I wrote a short time ago to protect a UNIX
OS I did the following:
  *  Set up a CRC table of system programs (ie those owned
     by root, bin and uucp)  The CRC table can only be
     modified by root and re-asks for his password during
     any modification.
  *  sh (the command processor) was modifyied to check
     the CRC table for system files being executed.
     If it changed it didn't execute.  As a matter
     of fact it was quarentined and mail was automatically
     sent to root about it.
  *  A daemon was run in backround to periodically check
     system files for change.  If changed they were quarintined
     ...especially if the "set-uid" bit was on.
This method left users with total freedom while it
protected system stuff.  There were other smaller features
as well and various other optional checks.

I suppose the "Lehigh virus" wasn't a virus then, since it didn't insert
itself into "arbitrary programs"?

Of course, we will also have to excuse the "Brain virus" since it
propagated to the boot sector, not an arbitrary program.

Sure!  And I can write a filter that zaps Command.Com & zeros out the
boot block too!  That'll stop those beasties!

> Let's reserve it for ...  a program that can 'infect' other programs
>by modifying them to include a possibly evolved copy of itself.

Closer.  The question is, what distinguishes an ordinary Trojan Horse
from the virus variant?  The answer is, the virus has a more-automated
distribution mechanism.  If I infect WORD PERFECT or WORDSTAR
(trademarks of some company) with an ordinary Trojan Horse, it will end
up in zillions of places.  The distribution, though is at human speeds.
Someone has to learn about the package order it, have it shipped, etc.
(In the government it is 'bureaucratic speed', an oxymoron).  A virus
speeds that distribution up by propagating itself electronically.
Focusing on "programs" is a little misleading; the distinction between
"data" and "programs" in the general sense is very difficult to make
cleanly.

For instance, the CHRISTMA EXEC existed within each user's VM space.
Now VM is just another program, so since the virus existed within it, it
had "infected" that user's VM "program."

If you have any questions for Dr.  Witten I may be able to pass them on
to him, r even give you his E-Mail address.  The article covers what a
virus cna do, and in fact gives you an idea of how to write one.

I recently got into a discussion about the origins of trojan horses and

idea of time bombs and such so as to protect shareware and non copyprotected
software.  Being a hacker, I don't believe hackers in general are innately

Here is an interesting set of documents that I found concerning the
validity of Phil Katz's archive makers and extractors.  The first
document concerns the court case between SEA and PK:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                FOR RELEASE ON AUGUST 1, 1988


From:     System Enhancement Associates, Inc. (SEA)
          and
          PKWARE, Inc. and Phillip W. Katz (PK)


August 1, 1988 - Milwaukee, WI

          In the first known "Shareware" litigation, pending in
the local United States District Court, the parties System En-
hancement Associates, Inc. (Plaintiff - SEA) and PKWARE, Inc.
/ Phillip W. Katz (Defendants - PK), after reaching agreement,
consented to the entry of the attached Judgment for Plaintiff
on Consent.  That Judgment was entered by Judge Myron L.
Gordon, effective on August 1, 1988.

          Part of the agreement reached by the parties included
a Confidential Cross-License Agreement under which SEA licensed
PK for all the ARC compatible programs published by PK during
the period beginning with the first release of PKXARC in late
1985 through July 31, 1988 in return for the payment of an
agreed upon sum which was not disclosed.  Additionally, PK was
licensed, for an agreed upon royalty payment, to distribute its
existing versions of PK's ARC compatible programs until January
31, 1989, after which PK is not licensed and agreed not to pub-
lish or distribute any ARC compatible programs or utilities that
process ARC compatible files.  In exchange, PK licensed SEA to
use its source code for PK's ARC compatible programs.

          PK agreed to cease any use of SEA's trademark "ARC"
and to change the names or marks used with PK's programs to
non-confusing designations.

          The Judgment provided for the standard copyright,
trademark and unfair competition injunctive relief for SEA a-
gainst PK, as well as damages and litigation expenses to be paid
by PK to SEA.

          Both parties agreed to refrain from any comment
concerning the settlement of the disputes, other than the text
of this press release.  Also, the parties instructed all of their
representatives to refrain from any such activity.

          Any other details of the Cross-License Agreement
were agreed to be maintained in confidence and under seal of
the Court.

          In reaching the agreement to dispose of the pending
litigation and to settle the disputes that are covered thereby,
PK did not admit any fault or wrongdoing.

................
Dave Williams, Sorry if I broke in-- you're chatting with Rick Kunz!

Yep...!

Sorry to bother you..what's this about PK36?


PK36 grabs some ints and doesn't let go of them. It's an attempt to foil
hackers, to avoid another PKX35B35 debacle. The problem occurs as far as I
know, only if you access PK36 from a shell, such as in viewarc utils, etc. It
causes some real unpredictable results with those.

No wonder!!!!! I run shelled out of Qmodem or PC-Write half the time, and I've
been having some radical hard disk problems - CRC errors all over the place. I
thought it was just the disk dying, but it started getting bad when I got
PK36. Haven't lost anything, but it sure makes some torturous moises.


Well, go back to 3.5, if you don't have it around, I put the .COM files in a
little arc in the general directory.

I think I have them laying around on an odd disk - I can get 'em locally if I
need 'em. Sort of a surprise, finding problems in PKARC......


For sure! Phil has his share of problems lately, the 3.6 thing, I noticed it
affecting serial communications on both machines as well as some frazzed disk
stuff, and a couple days after reverting to 3.5, my highspeed xfers are back
again. So if anyone gripes abouut file xfers, see if they've been using 3.6.

Yeah. !?! OK, thanks a lot. I'll let ya go....


Sure-have a good one!

I would argue that that is not the main point at all.  This is not the six
o'clock news, or even TV.  There are no good guys or bad guys here.  There is
nothing to be gained by finger pointing.   "We have seen the enemy and he
is us."

Viruses and Trojan Horses are simply special cases of lies.  Under most
circumstances, lying is considered bad form, even immoral.  In the case of
these programs, they are destructive of other peoples resources and of the
community's trust.  That seems adequate reason to condemn them and the
behavior of their authors in perpetrating them.

However, with the current spate of PC viruses, it seems reasonable to say
that they belong in the category of mischief, rather than that of evil.
While their authors could predict how they would behave in a given system,
there is evidence to suggest that they did not know how, or even if, they
would spread, or how destructive they might be.

Indeed, it seems clear that these acts were not motivated by vengeance or
even greed.  Rather, they were motivated, to the extent that they were
motivated at all, by idle curiousity.  The essentially gratuitous nature of
these acts is mitigated only by the fact that the perpetrators were also
ignorant of how much damage they might do.

Some have suggested intellectual curiousity as a motive.  However,
while it is possible to write a clever virus, one need not be clever to do
so.  Writing a destructive virus is not a demonstration of skill.  Perhaps
it was simply the novelty of the thing.  Or it may be, that having assayed
the power, the perpetrators were not sufficiently mature to resist the
temptation to use it.

And the rest of us, those of us with an interest in the honest labelling
and orderly behavior of programs, what has motivated us?  Clearly that has
been some greed and fear peddling.  There has been a certain amount of
grudging admiration.  Certainly there has been identification and sympathy,
for we know that the biggest difference between them and us is that they
coded theirs' and let them go.  We have reacted from incredulity (What do
you mean, it could take over my system?!), and from hubris ("I have a 100%
defense against viruses!" (when what he really meant was he could protect
your hard disk from updates).

Mostly we have reacted from fear; not the rational fear of a destructive
and mindless lie, but rather the fear that someone might try to keep the
truth from us.      Not the fear of the damage that could be done by a virus,
but the fear that in dealing with them someone else might infringe some
cherished privilege (What do you mean, I can't require my students to write
a virus?!).  We have reacted from almost every motive but enlightened
self-interest.

So you see, the point is not who is to blame.  There is plenty of blame to
go around.  Please do not start pointing fingers.

The issue is not where have we been, but where do we go.  The novelty is
gone forever.  It is now clear how much damage can be done.  It only
remains to be seen whether or not we can resist the temptation of the power
and bring ourselve to censure and sanction those who cannot.

I think you should be more selective about your use of the word
mainframe.  Each operating system has its own "way" of working and
one method of introducing a virus into a "mainframe" environment -
will not be successful in another opertaing system.

Your example of a virus-modem program might well work in Unix but
it would have to work quite differently in VM.  Viruses are basically
introduced to a mainframe VM user - simply by their executing a program
that has a virus.  It is not passed by modem nor in any other method.

Let us use Joe's example.  Notice how we are under the assumption that
each user will 'execute' the infected program.  One major difference
between VM and PC's is that in PCs all the files on disk are accessible
by anyone using the PC.  In VM, all files are not available - until
someone allows you access to his or her files.  Unix works in reverse -
all files are accessible until you impose some sort of password on it.
In VM - all files are not accessible until you impose a password on
your individual files.

In VM, there are systems disks which only systems people can write to.
You are now implying that a systems account has become infected.  How
does that happen?  By running some infected program.  How does that
infected program get to him?  Either via his virtual rdr or via a
link to a non-systems disk.  Any systems programmer who does either
of these is not a professional systems programmer who is responsible
for the maintenance of a multi-million dollar computer and thousands
of users.

The two rules are:

1) Never execute any program that arrives in your virtual reader that
   you don't know anything about.  You can receive it to disk - which
   will not infect you, but under no circumstance should you execute
   it.
2) Never link to a disk of a non-systems account.  All the programs
   a systems programmer needs are on systems maintained disks and
   he/she should not go scavanaging for all sorts of "other" pgms
   (i.e. games, utilities) that reside on privately maintained
   minidisks.  By doing so, he/she is compromising the operating
   system he was entrusted to maintain.

I remember one systems programmer who violated that rule and a clever
kid imbedded a nucleus extension in the systems programmer virtual
machine that informed the kid when it was installed via a MSG, then
proceeded to set MSG IUCV and SM IUCV and let the systems programmer
continue working while all the while everything he was typing
appeared on the console of the kid as well as the fact that the kid
had set the nucleus extension to accept cmds via IUCV and be executed
silently.  Imagine the suprise of the systems programmer as one
minute he browses PROFILE EXEC and the next instant the kid issues an
ERASE PROFILE EXEC via IUCV and the systems programmer never sees it
happening.

NUCXMAP did not reveal anything, since the kid called his stub NAMEFIND
which replaced the original NAMEFIND.  Only tracing the virtual machine
and finally finding that the NAMEFIND nucleus extension was larger
than the one everyone else had made the systems programmer suspicious.
But as soon as the systems programmer was close to debugging it - the
kid issued a 'NUCXDROP NAMEFIND' and the virtual machine virus disappeared
for good.  Only by executing the trojan horse game/program would it
reappear in the systems programmer virtual machine.  The trojan horse
program happened to be called RECEIVE MODULE and was located on a
users private disk that the systems programmer had accessed ahead of
the standard S-disk.

From:         Loren K Keim   -- Lehigh University <LKK0@LEHIGH>
Subject:      VM Mainframe Infiltration

Hank,

I have to disagree with you.  You say that a modem-mainframe
virus would never work in a VM environment, but we have
demonstrated such problems in the past.

It depends on the program.  Clarkson University makes a program
which I'm using right now on a VM system to answer your
mail.  It allows easy access to VM systems from microcomputer
networks.   It redefines all sorts of key configurations and
allows some interaction with VM files and programs.

If properly edited, a program of this kind (this is
theoretical, because I don't want to be blamed for
such a virus if one comes down the pike) can help you
log onto a system and look for standard Rexx files found
in certain college systems.  It can then append some
text to the Rexx program.  I don't know how easy it
would be to append to an executable file.  I have not
done any work with that as of yet, but inserting a line
or 20 of code into a Rexx program isn't that difficult,
particularly if the modem program is set up to help
you with editing features and so on.

We had a problem here with that particular program a short
time ago, in that someone wrote a bogus version which would
write passwords to the system out onto a file on the public
disks.

Any network is in danger, any mainframe is in danger at this
time.  The difference is how hard a system is to infiltrate,
and that is what we have been studying the last several
months.  As we learn exactly how a system may be infiltrated,
we're basically plugging up the holes.

Most of our anti-viral programs for mainframes are simply
plugging up any holes we can find, and running checks
to watch for propogation that isn't warrented.  This
is difficult to do, but until someone can figure out
a design that is very hard to break, we have to do something.

Actually, I quite enjoy trying to find a new way of
keeping computers clean.  Its much like a puzzle, and
we have to put the pieces together correctly.

Only time will tell... (now where have I heard that
before?)

Hank,


I think you missed the point.  You are under the assumption
that someone has to execute a bacterium for it to propogate.
In VM systems, at least in Rexx programs, a virus can be
hidden.  This could be one of your own programs, and I've
written several Rexx programs, with a hidden line somewhere,
or even an appended line that when you run it, it will
propogate.

You ask how systems accounts can become infected.  What
I was implying by the modem senario (and the modem
situation is by no means the only way to propogate a
virus), the program copies itself from floppy disk
to floppy disk, and in public sites with user consultants
on hand who have system account privilages, its possible
for one of their floppies to become infected.  When
this happens, unknown to them, a virus can be transferred
into a system program which people run.  Then we're in
big trouble.

Or perhaps a user has a program in Fortran he's compiled
on the system.  A system person runs the program (as
some do) and infects his own files.

As far as I've seen in my research so far, VM systems
are somewhat harder to propogate viruses on FOR ME.  I
am not that experienced yet with a VM system.  I
prefer Unix and VMS.

Comments?

One problem with specifically saying how viruses are
designed for different systems:   Several people have
commented to me that those who are responsible for
present and possibly future viruses are right here
on this list.

I don't like telling people how to hard my machines.
I like the idea of having a virus conference because
when I discuss things with people I have a much better
idea of who I'm talking to.
