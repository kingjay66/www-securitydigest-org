Subject: followup on alleged modem virus (PC)

It's been brought to my attention that the report of a modem virus
here on VIRUS-L a couple weeks ago was a hoax.  After looking at the
original announcement of the virus, I'm inclined to agree with that.
Specifically:

In addition to the fact that the reported virus is highly incredible,
as was pointed out by several of our readers, it's even more unlikely
that someone would have the name Mike RoChenle (read: Micro Channel).
Thus, unless someone can come forward with some substantial evidence
on this matter, I'd like for everyone to assume that the reported
virus was a hoax.

Obviously, I can't follow up on every message that gets sent to
VIRUS-L, but I would like to ask all persons submitting messages,
particularly when forwarding messages from other sources (as was the
case here), to confirm their sources of information, within reason.  I
certainly don't want VIRUS-L to become a source of disinformation, and
I'm sure that the readers don't want that either.

Thanks in advance for everyone's cooperation on this.  Oh, and Happy
Holidays to all!

Ken

VIRUS LISTINGS: Brett Ingerman and anybody else interested in
 compiling a virus "Dirty Dozen", let's keep in contact. Pam Kane
 is putting up a message on Delphi in order to find out how to
 contact Eric Newhouse. I still needto cull together some tools
 for desinating the cases on the listing so that the listing does
 drive university and other institutional public relations people
 up the wall.

 A possible format for a listing would a "neutral" identifier followed
 by the various names the virus is called. Then the symptoms and any
 particular qualities it may have. If the recovery procedure have any
 special indications, these would be mentioned with the listing for the
 virus. At the end of the listing would be general recovery procedures.

PC MAG ARTICLE: Recently somebody mentioned that John Dvorak's column
 of a few months ago claimed that software writers were already using
 viruses to attack competitors' products. From my recollections, the
 gave this as a hypothetical future scenario, not as a statement of
 current practice. While there have case were virus code was considered
 as a means of dealing with piracy and copyright infringement, no
 major "virus wars" are going on for now. (I have heard reports of
 immature BBS SysOps sabotaging eachother's systems with Trojans and
 viruses, but that's a different matter.)

Apple 2 5.25 inch drives had circuit level protection for disk drive
write protection.  Many people installed switches on the drive to
circumvent this.

Yes, if your FORMAT command has been subverted by a virus.

>this time?

Yes, if your COPY or DISKCOPY or XCOPY command has been subverted.

Yes, if the warm boot key sequence has been trapped and subverted.
There is a BIOS call that generates a warm boot without clearing
active memory.  There is no corresponding key combination that can
produce this, but a program can do it easily.

Yes, either one.  The boot sector of the floppy is small, but can easily
point to someplace in memory, which could survive an apparent warm boot,
or to some obscure file on a hard disk, which could survive a cold boot.

With only a boot sector's worth of space, a virus couldn't be very
elaborate.  A floppy-based virus would probably have info stored in
bad sectors, like Brain, but not necessarily.  Given complete control
of the File Allocation Table, a virus could hide its presence by
appearing to be junk in unused sectors at the end of the diskette.
Given complete control of the disk controller hardware and its pattern
of representation in memory, other things may be possible, like writing
between the formatted sectors on the diskette, or outside the pattern
of formatted tracks.  The PC system is more full of holes than Swiss
cheese, and I expect the same goes for other kinds of systems too.

I don't know about Brain's location in memory, but you could take a look
at the chapter on memory in the MS-DOS Encyclopedia in our Software
Lending Library, 126 CCC, Homer.  Too bad you missed my talk on viruses.

Subject: Write Protect Gritch

    OK gang, we're now up to 547 comments on write protect tabs.
    99.9% of these took the form of either "somebofy told me it was
    hardware" or "somebody told me it was software." I may have missed
    one, but near as I can recall, the ONLY PERSON who actually did
    his homework right was our fearless leader, Ken.

    I know Ken doesn't like people flaming on the list, so maybe I'll
    get booted for saying this, but PLEASE, if somebody asks a question
    which has a simple, yes or no answer, and you want to respond with
    an nth generation rumor of unknown origin, keep it short, because
    a thousand people or more are going to have to take the time to
    read what you say.  Better yet, if you want to respond to it,
    be an experimentalist like ken and read the manual or write a piece
    of code or something.

                        *Flame off*

Subject:      Can virus be placed on a blank formatted disk? (PC)

I'm sorry I was not clear.  Viruses are a lot like game theory from hell.

1.  Places for viruses to remain dormant.
    If it's magnetic and fits in the drive it can be infected.
2.  Places for viruses to be active.
    As far as I know there is only one place for a to
    be active.  That is the computers primary store, where instructions
    can be fetched and interpreted by the CPU.  For most PC's this means
    ram.  Note that the ram may be battery backed up!  If it is not,
    then removing power from this ram is the ONLY safe way to kill an
    active virus image.
3.  How a virus activates.
    As far as I know, all viruses are activated by inserting virus activation
    code in software routinely executed by the PC.  Obvious places for this
    are the boot block of a floopy, with or without DOS on it, the DOS
    hooks where reading and writing take place, and the keyboard interrupt
    hook.
4.  My conclusions.
    If you have an active ram based image of a virus in your system,
    it can do anything it has been programmed to accomplish, including
    writing on any magnetic media it wants to.  NOTE:  Thanks to Ken's
    rigorous inclinations, I feel comfortable in declaring that viruses
    don't have access to write protected floppies on IBM PC's  (old 5.25
    style machines).
5.  What can you do?
    Pray
    Run protection software like FluShot for partial protection.
    Routinely check your hard disk for infection.
    Sample floppies to check for virus infection.
    Get a lawyer to write an obnoxiious, unfair, and effective statement
    of limited liability.

Query: What can any of the known viruses do to the Hard Disk?
       Can they actually disrupt data,  or even damage the drive?
       It now seems that the viruses can actually infect write-protected
       diskettes, how will this effect the hardware of the Hard Disk?

  I also want to thank Christian J. Haller for his info. I learned
   a lot from it! (I just joined virus-l).

Subject: You can't fool the write protect line w/software (PC)

According to the  circut diagram  from IBM   for  IBM  5.25"  diskette
drives, (From the logic diagram section in the IBM technical reference
guides) the write  protect mechanism is a  hardware  device that takes
its input from the write protect switch.  Normally, the switch remains
closed. When a write protect tab is placed in front of the switch, the
switch is  opened.  Then, the   erase line and the  write  signals are
disabled.  This  is directly  controlled by  the   switch.  There is a
provision  for  this  to be jumpered  so  that  the  drive permanently
ignores the write protect switch.  Thus, all the talk recently of this
being controlled by software is incorrect.

Richard Baum & John Hunt

PS: We have not examined the circut diagrams for 3.5" drives,  but  we
    assume that they work in a similar fashion.

[Ed. Thanks guys!  The only possible weak link then would be a
malfunctioning write-protect sensor (normally an optic sensor, I
believe).  If the light to the sensor passes through the tab due to
a tab being not opaque enough, then I'd assume that the drive might
believe that the drive is ok to write to.  Likewise, if the light is
sent and detected on the same side of the disk via a reflector on the
other side, and if the write-protect tab itself is reflecting light,
then the detector might get an incorrect signal.

The solution, of course, is to use black non-reflecting write-protect
tabs, and to trust the hardware to do its job.

Let us all hope that this issue has been cleared up once and for all.
Thanks to everyone who helped out!]

Subject:  virus in bad sectors of an unbootable floppy (PC)

There's no harm in a virus hanging out in "bad" sectors of an
unbootable, source-only floppy; the virus cannot be invoked.  Even if
an executable is copied to the disk later, it won't be linked with the
virus in any way.  All a virus can do by putting itself on bad sectors
is take up disk space, since nothing will ever read memory from those
sectors.  The only danger will be if the virus is also in the boot
block somehow.

If the disk is bootable, or has an infected executable, then either of
those programs could load the virus off the bad sectors.

I don't know the format of the boot record, but if IBM did things with
their customary stupidity, the OS loads a boot program off the block
and attempts to execute, regardless of whether there was a boot
program actually on the disk.  However, I give them credit for having
done something different, because if you try to boot a non-system
disk, it behaves in a predictable manner.  So either the formatter
puts a program on the boot block that prints the message: Non-system
disk, etc., or the OS looks at the boot record and sees that there's
no boot program there.

Putting an unfunctional boot program there would allow virus infection
of an unbootable diskette, since the virus could hook up to the boot
program.  Any time you did a warm boot, the virus would get executed
and then you'd see the non-system disk message.  This would have been
a stupid design decision for (among others) precisely this reason.

Having the OS check for a boot program is a tougher situation for the
virus.  In this case, there is a magic number or some other indication
of whether a program is residing on this block.  The OS checks this
indicator and performs accordingly.  A virus could still infect an
unbootable disk by jumping on the boot block and pretending it's a
boot program, but in order to be inconspicuous it would have to then
print out a non-system disk message and wait for the user to load a
new disk.  I haven't heard of any virus that does this.

So there are basically two scenarios:
1: the OS always loads and executes whatever is on the boot block; in
   this case, the formatter must always put a program in the boot
   block, or the computer would hang.
2: the OS checks what's on the boot block and then loads and executes
   it if there's something there.

In scenario 1 virus infection is pretty easy; in scenario 2, it requires
a more sophisticated virus.  Does anyone know which is the actual case
(or if I've missed something)?  Someone with a Technical Reference?

A corollary of scenario 2 is that if such a virus does not exist, there
is no danger in a virus inhabiting "bad" sectors of an unbootable,
source-only disk.

Some people have talked about doing low-level formats of their hard
disks in order to kill a virus.  I'm curious as to what ye believe the
difference is as far as virus infection is concerned.  Does a
bad-sector virus have some method of linking its lost segments back
into a file?  Whenever a new FAT is created, no file will ever use
those bad sectors unless a virus links them up again.  If the sectors
are recovered, their contents will be irrelevant.  Even if the
contents remain in an execut- able file, through a very unusual
procedure involving a copy program that opens its output file
read-write, the virus code will no longer be part of the code segment
of the executable.  And I don't think any such copy program exists
anyway.

So what is the thing with a low-level format that will destroy a virus
when a normal format won't?

Subject: Problems with commercial software (PC)

We have recently heard from people having trouble formatting disks
on their MS-DOS-PCs. In fact their computers did not allow formatting,
reading or writing diskettes of any type. Some also reported that
some files or programmes residing on the harddisk were damaged or even
destroyed.
We have already found out that only those who had a copy of a game
called 'Leisure Suit Larry' installed on their disk were affected.
Actually, this game was to be found on some PCs at our Computer Center,
and the people in question 'just made a copy' of it.
Our problem now is: How can we get rid of that virus (at least, we
believe it to be one)? Has anybody heard of it and can help us
to solve our problem? I would be most glad to get some mail...

Yours truly
