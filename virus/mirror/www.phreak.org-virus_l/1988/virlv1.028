Subject: Request for Apple // anti-virus software (Apple //)


I've looked at the anti-virus programs available from this list, and
they all seem to be Mac and PC programs.  Are there any available for
the Apple // that someone could post?  I know that // users such (like
me) are rare in the higher education world, but there are several
viruses for the Apple //s out and I know a bunch of primary and
secondary ed. people who would like to seem some anti-viral programs
for their machines.

Anyone?  Or am I alone here?

Subject: Internet Worm report distribution

Well, I'm very convinced now that interest in the Internet Worm has
not died, judging from the number of people who've requested copies of
Gene Spafford's report.  There are still a couple of problems, though:

1) The file is too big to distribute in one piece via BITNET.  At
least with any degree of reliability.  Besides, it would be rude, and
a senseless overload of the net to send out all the copies via BITNET.

2) The file is in PostScript, and I really can't be printing copies on
our PS printer and mailing them out.

I've had one very generous offer to make the file available via
anonymous FTP (thanks Les!), and that will help out for all the people
with Internet access.  My first thought was that people with Internet
access would be the only ones who would want the paper, but I was
wrong.  Nonetheless, anyone with Internet access can anonymous FTP the
file from pine.circa.ufl.edu (IP # 128.227.128.55).  The file's name
is tr823.ps.

Otto Stolz recommended that I make it available via the Postal Service
to anyone who send a disk and Self Addressed Stamped Envelope to me,
he even offerred to supply the same service to anyone in Europe
(thanks Otto!).  No problem; anyone without Internet access who wants
the PostScript file can send me a 360k or 1.2M 5 1/4" (DOS) disk with
a self addressed stamped envelope, and I'll be glad to mail out the
PostScript file.  Anyone who wants this, please send me e-mail
(luken@spot.cc.lehigh.edu or luken@lehiibm1.bitnet) requesting my US
mail address.

Finally, a problem still remains for people without access to a
PostScript printer.  I don't have a solution for this yet,
unfortunately, but I'm wide open to suggestions.

It should be noted that Gene Spafford's distribution policy is as
follows:  "Permission is hereby granted to make copis of this work,
without charge, solely for the purposes of instruction and research.
Any such copies must include a copy of this title page and copyright
notice.  Any other reproduction, publication, or use is strictly
prohibited without express written permission."

No!  I choose to have open windows on my house and doors that can be
easily opened and closed.  To argue that I should live in a bank vault
to avoid the thugs is wrong.  I should live as I choose, and if a thug
enters and robs, or just enters, he or she is at fault and should be
delt with.  If my insurance goes up, that is my problem, but your
right to walk in because I have installed poor or no locks is not
granted.
