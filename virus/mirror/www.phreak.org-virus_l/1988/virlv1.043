Subject: administrative announcement - new list

In light of the recent (good) suggestions for expanding VIRUS-L, I've
implemented (thanks to Jim!) a new list, VALERT-L, which is to be used
strictly for virus announcements (e.g., "We just got hit by virus X -
what do we do???!?!?!").  Any discussion beyond the initial
announcement should be carried on either by private e-mail or on
VIRUS-L.  Messages sent to VALERT-L will automatically be cross-posted
in VIRUS-L digests whenever the next digest goes out.

Anyone sending non-announcement material to VALERT-L had better be
wearing asbestos skivvies - instant cinder.  In addition to the
resulting flames, these individuals will be removed from the list.
One of the reasons that I changed VIRUS-L to a digest format list was
to reduce the load on our IBM mainframe, LEHIIBM1.BITNET.  I don't
want VALERT-L becoming a problem.  Rather, it's just a vehicle for
urgent announcements to be used only when absolutely necessary.
With any degree of luck, VALERT-L will be extremely quiet.

Note that VALERT-L is being started on a *trial basis*.  If the
guidelines aren't adhered to, then it will have to be removed.  It
could be a very useful tool for getting warnings out to the network if
it is used properly; let's make the best of it.

Ok, now for the details:

1) As stated above, all VALERT-L submissions will be cross-posted to
VIRUS-L.  VIRUS-L readers should decide whether they want to be
subscribed to both lists and plan accordingly.

2) Subscribe to VALERT-L the same way you did to VIRUS-L; send mail to
LISTSERV@LEHIIBM1.BITNET saying SUB VALERT-L Your Name.  Please do not
send this mail to anything other than LISTSERV@LEHIIBM1!!

3) Backlogs will be kept via VIRUS-L.  That is, since VALERT-L
messages will be cross posted to VIRUS-L (thus, logged there), there
will be no separate backlogs for VALERT-L.

4) As with VIRUS-L, VALERT-L is open to anyone who adheres to its
guidelines.

I feel that this is the best compromise between a non-moderated group
for timely information and a moderated one for open discussion of the
issues.  Now it's up to the subscribers to make it worthwhile...  As
always, comments and suggestions are welcomed!

Subject:  Where can one get Fred Cohen's Thesis?

Hello All,
   I know that you are tired of seeing messages like this, but frankly I
am at an end.  I am interested in obtaining a copy of Fred Cohen's
thesis.  Dorothy White at (I think) UAB left a message on this list
claiming that she got a copy of said document.  I then proceeded to send
her some mail, and nothing has been returned to me.  Thus I am appealing
to this list.  Does anyone have any details on how to obtain this
thesis?  If so, I would greatly appreciate it if you could send me some
mail with the details.

                    Thanks!

[Ed. In the past week (or so), I talked to a Professor from Univ. of
Cincinatti who told me that Fred Cohen had resigned from there
approximately 2 weeks before that.  I don't know where he is now,
however.]

                     "BIG GUNS TAKE AIM AT VIRUS"
                       by Neil Munro, GCN Staff

      "In the aftermath of the most recent virus infection of the
Defense Data Network and Arpanet, Defense Department and National
Institute of Standards and Technology computer security officials are
scrambling to head off further attacks.

      "Officials of the facilities struck by the virus met this month
to discuss its nature and impact. The meeting at National Security
Agency headquarters in Fort Meade, Md., included representatives of
NSA and NIST as 'observers,' according to NIST computer security chief
Stuart Katzke.

      "Two days later, NSA and NIST officials met again to discuss how
to avert future infections, Katzke said. Katzke, who attended both
meetings, said no decisions had been reached on how to combat viruses,
and NSA and NIST representatives will meet again to firm up
recommendations.

      "Katzke, however, suggested one solution would be the formation
of a federal center for anti-virus efforts, operated jointly by NSA's
National Computer Security Center (NCSC) and NIST.

      "The center would inclinghouse that would collect and
disseminate information about threats, such as flaws in operating
systems, and solutions. However, funding and personnel for the center
is a problem, he said, because NIST does not have funds for such a
facility.

      "The center also would help organize responses to emergencies by
quickly warning users of new threats and defenses against them, he
said. People with solutions to a threat could transmit their answers
through the center to threatened users, he said. A database of experts
would be created to speed response to immediate threats.

      "The center would develop means of correcting flaws in software,
such as trapdoors in operating systems. Vendors would be asked to
develop and field solutions, he said.

      "NIST would work on unclassified systems and the NCSC would work
on secure military systems, he said. Information learned about viruses
from classified systems might be made available to the public through
the clearinks rapidly
became clogged, greatly slowing down communications. Across the
network, computer systems crashed as the virus continuously replicated
itself.

      "During a Pentagon press conference on the virus outbreak,
Raymond Colladay, director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency (DARPA), said the virus hit 'several dozen' installations out
of 300 on the agency's unclassified Arpanet network.

"Thousands Affected

      "The virus also was found in Milnet, which is the unclassified
portion of the Defense Data Network. Estimates of how many computers
on the network were struck varied from 6,000 to 250,000. The virus did
not affect any classified systems, DOD officials said.

      "The virus hit DARPA computers in Arlington, Va., and the
Lawrence Livermore Laboratories in California as well as many academic
institutions, Colladay said. It also affected the Naval Ocean Systems
Command in San Diego and the Naval Research Laboratory in Maryland, a
Navy somputers, the
virus was released Nov. 2 into Arpanet through a computer at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Mass.

      "The Virus apparently was intended to demonstrate the threat to
networked systems. Published reports said the virus was developed and
introduced by a postgraduate student at Cornell University who
specializes in computer security. The FBI has interviewed the student.

      "Clifford Stoll, a computer security expert at Harvard
University who helped identify and neutralize the virus, said the
virus was about 40 kilobytes long and took 'several weeks' to write.
It replicated itself in three ways.

"Spreading the Virus

      "The first method exploited a little-known trapdoor in the
Sendmail electronic-mail routine of Berkeley UNIX 4.3, Stoll said. The
trapdoor was created by a programmer who wanted to remove some bugs,
various reports said.  However, the programmer forgot to remove the
trapdoor in the final production versioe virus was an assembly language
program that found user names and then tried simple variations to
crack poorly conceived passwords and break into more computers, Stoll
said.

      "Yet another replication and transmission method used a widely
known bug in the Arpanet Finger program, which lets users know the
last time a distant user has signed onto a network. By sending a
lengthy Finger signal, the virus gained access to the operating
systems of Arpanet hosts.

      "The virus was revealed because its creator underestimated how
fast the virus would attempt to copy itself. Computers quickly became
clogged as the virus rapidly copied itself, although it succeeded only
once in every 10 copy attempts.

      "Users across the country developed patches to block the virus'
entrance as soon as copies were isolated and analyzed. Many users also
used Arpanet to disseminate the countermeasures, although transmission
was slowed by the numerous virus copies in the system.

. As soon as we
had put that fix in place, we could get back on,line.'

      "Colladay said DARPA will revise security policy on the network
and will decide whether more security features should be added. The
agency began a study of the virus threat two days after the virus was
released, he said.

      "All observers said the Arpanet virus helped raise awareness of
the general virus threat. Several experts said it would help promote
computer security efforts. 'Anytime you have an event like this it
heightens awareness and sensitivity,' Colladay said.

      "However, Katzke cautioned that viruses are less of a threat
than are access abusers and poor management practices such as
inadequate disaster protection or password control. Excellent
technical anti-virus defenses are of no use if management does not
maintain proper control of the system, he said.

      "Congress also is expected to respond to the virus outbreak. The
Computer Virus Eradication Act of 1988, wh

               "WHY SOFTWARE DEFECTS SO OFTEN GO UNDISCOVERED"
                        DP ISSUES by William E. Perry

      "Much has been written recently about defects in computer
software.  Defects are not new, but quantifying their frequency is
new. We are beginning to see the magnitude of the problem.

      "Some researchers say we are making between 40 and 80 defects
per 1,000 lines of source code. A line of source code normally is
defined as an executable line of code. A defect is a variation from
specifications, no matter how insignificant.

      "Most defects are caught before the system goes into production.
However, we are told that, on average, one to three defects per 1,000
lines of code get into production. The production defects can cause a
minor inconvenience, such as misspelling an executive's name, or wreak
havoc in an organization through the loss of large amounts of
resources.

      "There ares, which are uncovered by end users.

      "The question that needs to be asked in your organization is,
'Who uncovers the defects?'

      "The answer may determine how credible your organization is in
the eyes of your end users. The more defects uncovered by the
information systems community, the greater the credibility of that
information processing function.

"Discouraging Efforts

      "But information systems personnel may be discouraged from
identifying defects, for several reasons:

      "- Finding a defect may mean more work for them, not only in
correcting it but also in tracking, monitoring and retesting the
corrections.

      "- Frequently, there is a finger-pointing to determine who is
responsible for the defect. The game is to pin the blame on another
person. An individual held responsible for a defect can lose
professional credibility and be ridiculed by his colleagues.

      "- Finally, defects can result in schedule delays or budget
overruysis can me
skipped, to meet schedule and budget limits.

      "There are also adverse consequences when defects are uncovered
outside the information systems group.

      "First is the high cost of correction. Barry Boehm of TRW Inc.
said the cost of correcting a defect in production can be as much as
100 times the cost of correcting it during development.

      "Also, the information systems group may lose credibility. The
end users may look for alternative solutions, such as purchased
software or end-user-developed applications.

      "Some fundamental truths have a bearing on who uncovers defects
and the effect of those defects.

      "First, punishing those who detect defects in-house only
tranfers the job to external users and customers. If it is made
undesirable for the author to find defects in his own work, he won't
look for them. People naturally avoid punishment.

"Hiding the Blame

      "When individuals are held to blame for defects, they tend to
hide them.  For example, when an independent test group is checking
the work of a software author, and that test will pinpoint blame on
the author, the author will do whatever can be done to get the system
through the test so future blame will rest on the independent test
rather than the author.

      "When individuals are encouraged to hide defects, the cause of
those defects cannot be corrected and they will recur in future
systems. This is the major consequence of blaming people, rather than
processes, for defects.

      "The objective of the information systems organization should be
to detect 100 of the application defects internally.

      "All defects must be considered. These include not only defects
made because of MIS errors but also defects because of poor
requirement identification and poor design concepts. Whenever the
system fails to meet the true needs of the customer in a
cost-effective manner, it should be considered a defect.

      "Information systems managers must uncover defects internally.
This means not blaming one's employees for defects uncovered during
development. In fact, it may be necessary to reward internally
uncovered defects in order to reduce externally uncovered defects."

Institute, Orlando, Fla.



      That's it! I hope at least some, if not all, of you found it of
interest!

Subject:     Help with a virus! (PC)
From:        "Michael J. MacDonald" <MIKEMAC@UNB.BITNET>

   We discovered a virus (actually a worm) on Monday, 1988 Dec 05.

   We know the following:
      1) It works for IBM PC's and compatables.

      2) The worm resides on the boot block of a disk.

      3) The computer is infected when an infecteoks to see
         if it has an infected disk if it does not it picks up the
         "real" bootstrap drops in on a spot near the end of the disk,
         and installs itself in the bootstrap and then boots the machine.

      5) The place were it drops the "real" bootstrap is sector 709
         on a 360K floppy I doubt this is true for any other media.

      6) The WORM is counting. It doesn't seem to be counting anything
         obvious, number of copies of itself, number of machines...

      7) We can track the worm back to approx 88 Nov 24, to a public
         machine.

      8) By considence there were 3 FAT tables "magically" erased in the
         last 2 weeks that we know of. I was at a party on Saturday night
         and some of the comments that I was getting suggests that a
         fair number of organizations outside the university may have
         been hit.

      9) We have it disassembled and I will getting help from our
         EE depart that will detect and erase the worm,
         it is appended to this request for info.  [Ed. The program
         was rather large; I'll make it available via the LISTSERV if
         there is sufficient interest.]

   Questions
    1)  Have you seen this worm before?
    2)  Any idea of the origin?
    3)  Will this worm really erase the FAT?

  I am not on this news group please respond to me direct.
