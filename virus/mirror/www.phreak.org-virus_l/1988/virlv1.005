Subject: The worm and the debug option
Cc: manis@grads.cs.ubc.ca

Sorry -- in both Berkeley's and Sun's standard distribution, debugging
comes enabled.  That's perhaps defensible from Berkeley; they're
distributing a research system, to customers prone to tinker, and
sendmail is certainly complex enough to need lot's of debugging.  Nor
can I necessarily criticize it from Sun; it's often useful to be able
to trace such a program.  The flaw is not that debug mode was
possible; rather, that sendmail's debug mode (a) was accessible
remotely; and (b) expanded the range of inputs accepted by the
program, rather than just providing extra trace data.  What's even
more amazing is the statement Eric Allman (the author of sendmail) was
quoted in the N.Y. Times as making: that he added that code to get
around restrictive management policies.  That is, it was a deliberate
back door, albeit one with a nominally-limited intended scope.

Subject: Risks of unchecked input in C programs

A security bug in the 4.2BSD Unix finger daemon, which permitted its
invoker to obtain a shell with super-user privileges, was exposed
during the recent Internet worm discussion.  The bug was caused by use
of the C standard I/O routine "gets" which is a bug waiting to happen
and which should be stamped out.  (I have deleted gets from my
standard I/O implementation, and the folks at Bell Labs Research have
deleted gets from their C library.)  The bug was that the finger
daemon used gets to read a line of input from its network connection,
and gets is unable to check that the input line fits within the buffer
handed to gets, so a suitably-constructed line of input to the finger
daemon steps on other variables, confusing the finger daemon.

gets, as part of standard I/O, is a decade-old backward-compatibility
hack for compatibility with the Sixth Edition UNIX Portable I/O
Library, which was utterly replaced by standard I/O no later than
1979.  gets takes one parameter, the input buffer into which a line of
input from the standard input stream is to be stored, and deletes any
trailing newline from the buffer.  Standard I/O contains an
alternative to gets, called fgets, which takes three parameters: an
input buffer, its size in bytes, and the stream to be read.  fgets
does not strip trailing newlines.  Converting programs from using gets
to fgets is largely mechanical, and stripping trailing newlines is
trivial to code yourself.  gets is inherently unsafe due to its
inability to check for overrun of the buffer provided to it.  There is
no reason to use gets, and there are good reasons to avoid gets.

Subject:      digesting

digesting the list is in my opinion an idea whose time has come, but
it creates a problem.  For some reason, all my mail messages are truncated
at 200 lines.  Is there any way around this problem??


[Ed. The BITNET limit on filesize (as stated in the BITNET Usage
Guidelines) is 300,000 characters; the VIRUS-L digests are nowhere
near that large.  Also, the digests are being sent out in full.
Perhaps some mailer between here and there (even yours, perhaps?) is
truncating for you.  If so, it *certainly* shouldn't be!  Has anyone
else experienced the same problem?]

Here's a message found on comp.protocols.tcp-ip regarding media
coverage of the Internet worm.

Subject: various virus (wondrous worm?) quotes

Thot you all might enjoy some excerpts from some of the more vacuous
articles about the recent infection.

These quotes do not make any more sense in full context. Honest.

Both excerpts are reprinted without permission.

ComputerWorld, Nov 7, p157: "MIS reacts"

"...Polaroid Corp. in Cambridge, Mass., told users to minimize their
exposure to the virus by temporarily avoiding use of databases
established by neighbor and virus victim MIT.

"'We always insist that our people don't replicate software or
otherwise violate copyright laws,' said Al Hyland, director of
world-wide systems at Polaroid...

"...Carl Conger, manager of client services at Texas Utilities Co. in
Dallas said, 'Most of our corporate communications is on leased
lines.'"


PC Week, Nov7, p8: "'Worm' Attacks National Network"

"...No data was destroyed, however, leading computer experts to state
that it was a worm, not a virus. A software worm differs from a virus
in that it is a program that installs itself in a system and takes
total control of a computer's resources, while a virus consists of
code that is installed in a program and, when invoked, can spread
throughout a system and destroy data."

Even Bob Page's attempt to write carefully has an obvious flaw.  Robert
Morris Sr. is not the "head of the head of the National Computer Security
Center."  He is the chief scientist of that organization.  Pat Gallagher
is the director (head) and Paul Peters is the deputy director.  As chief
scientist, Bob Morris has a staff position and reports to the director.

Hello All,

Could anyone help me find a good source of information (In addition to
this list) on viruses, worms, trojan horses and the like?  Any
recommended readings or publications?  Thanks in advance.
