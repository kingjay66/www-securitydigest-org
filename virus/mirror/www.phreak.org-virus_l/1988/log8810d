It seems to me that on a pc type system the following steps should
stop the virus's that are floating.

1) Make command.com and system files READ-ONLY.

2) Use FLUSHOT (direct from author)

3) Use common sense.

The combination of the 3 steps above just caught a virus in a copy of
Norton Commander someone sent to me. This is a new and nasty virus and
you will hear more as soon as I get the time.

Well we have a little more on the Norton virus. It eats command.com
and the system files, as well as destroying both Fat tables and all know
backups like Mace utilties and Disk optimizer produce.

This is a little more vicious than most because a FULL format of the hard
disk is required after being attacked. By full I mean both low level and
dos formats must be done. Otherwise the little bugger is still on the disk
(boy did we find out the hard way) and will reattack you at a later date.

I would like to thank the eight out-of-town individuals who I met at the
virus conference this weekend in the Lehigh Valley, Pa.  I can't say
that I learned anything that I didn't read on virus-l, but being able
to discuss these topics in a little greater depth and on a closer basis
was very informative.  I handed out disks to most of the participants
with a collection of public domain anti-viral/trojan packages and would
appreciate any comments and evaluations of these products sent to me.
( -Especially on FluShot Plus 1.4; it seems as though no one will try
this package, even though it has most of the bugs worked out from the
older versions.)
  Thanks a lot,

P.S. To the Calgary Contingency: When Chris and I make our ways out
there... we'll be sure to call.

Subject:      The Virus Conference - thank you

Actually David, I'm intreged by your comments:

You mentioned something about all that we discussed were old
virus-l topics, and I don't believe that's ctrue.   Since you
weren't present for quite a bit of the conference, you may
have missed some of the things we discussed, but we did
go over organizations tracking viruses, integrity systems
including the Bell-Lapadula, Limited Transistivity, Complexity
Based Integrity and Separation (I think we have baredly touched
on these on the list), and we did talk about Wroms in greater
detail than on the list.

We ended up having a total of 14 people show up for the conference
(although several people were there only half the ftime).

I had gotten worried early on that the conference might have
problems, we had two people call and cancel at the last minute,
two that said they were coming never showed (JD Where are you?),
and two groups that said they'd send representatives didn't.
We had the additional progblem that the printer company I
usd to print and bind the books seems to have broken their
tape binding machine and we had to give out the book in
loose form in folders.

However, as one person stated "Its easier to talk, discuss
subjects and get points across in smaller groups", and I
think it went quite well.  We had an excellent group of
people with a greatly varied knowledge of the subject
viruses

I do want to say thanks to everyone who came!  It was
really appreciated, and I hope you all took something
out of the conference.

The conference ended up being more informal than oformal
and I believe that worked quite well with this group of
people.  Its always interesting to meet people who you
have been discussing subjects with for some months without
meeting then face to face.    Thanks goes to Chris Haller
of Cornell who corrected many of my spelling atrocities
(that word isn't even close is it?_)  Also, Steve Okay
from the Source took notes on his laptop throughout the
3 days and apparently will be making the mnotes available
in the future.  Because it was lengthy, I believe it will
take him some time to confvert his notes to something
readable.  (Please excusse my typing, I seem to be missing
the backspace key)

Thanks to all who made this conference psossible!

Subject:      The Book / Effects of the Conference

Reading through my notes and letters to me, several people
have asked if I think we'll see any effects of the conference.
I'd like to forward this statement through the list to everyone
who did come and ask them if they think it helped them.

For me, I got a number of ideas and quite a bit of help on
correcting mahny of the ideas I had previously.  Joe Sieczkowski
gave us some unique ideas on Unix protection schemes, which
I greatly enjoyed and we may see something come of that over
the next year.  I believe the group helped him to look at
different aspects of what he wanted to do .  Hopefully
we've also given people that little bit of information that
they might need to help prevent viruses in the future.  I
believe there were a few good points about network security,
and we may see more security at some colleges through
networks due to some of our discussions.  I really felt it
was much easier to disucss the problems in group than to
write them in short letters over the net.

As for the book, we've gotten numerous request s for it.
We have located another printer and gotten some prcice
quotes today for anyoje interested.  I want to point out
that the price I am setting the book / notes at is about
5 prercent higher than MY cost.  I'm doing that to cover
the expense of the conference  (I ran into the hole on
it slightly), and to make sure I am covered, as I always
seem to underestimate the costs.  I'm pointing aout that
I'm not making money off this for the simple reason that
we can't advaertize over bitnet and I've already had one
woarning that I may not do so  .

The book is broken down into a few sections:
  -  Introduction to Computer Viruses (Definitions, Detection methods)
  -  Background and Experiments (From Von Neumann through Kraus through
       Cohen, including Computer VWorms, Core Wars and so on)
  -  Major Viruses and Resultant Detection Schemes (Mainframe
       and Micro viruses including the source code to the Christma
       Exec which now should be powerless and has been published
       elsewhere, and a look at 2 versions of the Brain, Lehigh,
       Aldus and the Israeli)
  -  Early Defense Methods (Partition Models and Flow Models)
   - Practical Defense Methods (Comlplexisty Based Integrity and
       other ideas)
  -  The Future (Secure Systems in danger, dangers viruses pose)

and 4 appendices :

  -  Term Glossary
  -  List of Known Viruses
  -  Viruses in the Classroom
  -  Virus Law

I will also include a paper that Pam Kane sent me.

(Those of you who have already gotten thr packet, as I said,
I am going to enhance the "Furture " Section, and niclude
the 3 missing appendices in the mail this week)

The known viruses section is a bit schetchy in that it doesn't
include quite a few viruses in existance.  I would like to
see a break down or flow chart of how each virus works from
a reputable source before I s include it, so anyone who has
worked with one recently, please send me what you can to LKK0
at LEHIGH.  I do inlcude a number of viruses howevera and
their breakdowns).

Incidently, when I talk about defense methods in the book, I
just describe them, I don't prove them matehematially, although
I've been asked at times to do so.  I will be trying to put
together a book later this year (with much better editing)
which will be about defense methods, including some ideas I've
had and several that have been send to me (with full report
going to the author of each) and will be shoing the math.  I
ll try to pubisdh that if I can.

Subject:      even *MORE* on hardware damage

All this talk of "programs" causing damage to hardware has caused a few
of the ole cobwebs to clear out of the history section of my brain which
caused a story that I heard a long long time ago in a CS101 class to surface..

"...It seems that a programmer who delighted in taking excessively long lunch
hours discovered a way to shut down the computer for hours at a time.  It
happened that the programmer -- in those days also being somewhat of an
Electrical Engineer -- discovered exactly which MAGNETIC CORE was closest to
the High-Temp shutdown sensor, and wrote a program which continously wrote
an alternating pattern of binary 0's and 1's to *THE* core, until it got hot
enough to trigger the High-Temp shutdown sensor.  The sensor, being decieved
into thinking that the entire machine was overheating, promptly shut it down"

The  archive  server  at  RPICICGE  (and  indirectly  SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL)
maintains a  huge collection  of anti-viral  programs that  should prove
equal to most viroid strains.

Directions for using  the RPI archive server can be  found in the latest
issues of NetMonth (published by the famous Chris Condon [BITLIB@YALEVM]
and available  from better servers  near you, esp.  LISTSERV@MARIST). If
you   have  access   to  the   Internet,   the  files   are  stored   on
simtel20.army.mil,  IP  address 26.0.0.74.  Log  in  as user  ANONYMOUS,
password is your  real userid and node. All the  virus-related files are
stored in the directory PD1:<MSDOS.TROJAN-PRO>.

For those  of you getting the  programs via the Internet,  remember that
SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL  is a  DEC-20 and  uses 36-bit  words. You  *must* use
TENEX mode when you FTP the files or you *will* get garbage -- issue the
TENEX command before doing the GET for the file you want.

Subject:      RE: CMU and the virus


I just talked with a friend of mine who happens to be a student at CMU about
viruses, and CMU did indeed get hit.

I'm not sure what virus it was, but it infected their Macs, including some
file servers.

It seems the virus got onto one of the servers, and a new version of software
for a class was to be distributed.  Their distribution method is such that
the software is placed on the server, and all students needing it can then
copy from the server for their own uses.

Well, the server containing the distribution copy of Genie (a Pascal
interpreter of sorts) was contaminated, and thus an infested copy of Genie
got quickly and widely spready around campus.

I know this is somewhat sketchy, but it's all I have for now.  Perhaps someone
a little closer to the Pittsburgh area can get more information?

Loren, I think you did an excellent service in organizing the
conference.  The three of us from Calgary (Grey Lypowy, Corey Wirun and
myself) found it very helpful to be able to work some ideas back and
forth without the delays and mis-communications inevitable in this
electronic medium.  Also, it gave us a good handle on what you guys are
doing and, hopefully, you understand what we are up to in Canada.  I
think a follow-on conference is needed at some point but we should all
sit back and digest this one for a while.  Tom Keenan

I myself found the size of the conference to actually be a boon more than
anything else...it was a lot easier to disseminate information across a
table than across the room, and I found it to be quite informative.
Thanks to Loren and all the others who helped make this possible
and I'd like to toss in a special thanx to the guys from Calgary and Cornell
who helped in carting me around this weekend----it was and is much appreciated.
Overall I'd say it was a successful and quite informative meeting.....

The virus that hit CMU was "nVIR", as named by interferon 3.1. It is apparantly
the same one that hit Pitt (which is about a block and a half away) two
weeks ago. Incidentally, here at Pitt we seemed to have eradicated the virus
very quickly. Thanks to everyone who gave suggestions on informing users about
it. They worked well, and we have seen no incidents of the virus since
early last week. I know because I take classes at CMU and Pitt. (Perhaps
I was the unknowing culprit!?!) Anyway, happy-virus hunting.

OK, I think I've posted this message a dozen times on different groups...

IF you have something to say, PLEASE specify what machine you are talking
about.

I'm specifically thinking of the many references we've had to anti-viral
programs (like FLUSHOT) and anti-viral libraries, which NEVER mention what
machine they run on.  Usually you can assume this means an IBM PC, since only
IBM users are arrogant enough to believe that no other machines exist. : )

You are right, it does no harm. In fact, with a little lubrication

Subject:      UIUC Brain update



What has been done about our Brain virus infection:

1)  As previously noted the Brain virus was discovered here on Thursday
    October 20, 1988.  Since then, we have guestimated that the infection
    had spread for at least three weeks undetected.

2)  Information files and programs have been obtained from Lehigh, NBBS,
    Bitnic, and other sources.

3)  Files and programs distributed on campus via anonymous ftp
    from uxe.cso.uiuc.edu (128.174.5.54).

4)  Our samples of the Brain virus have been compared to the known
    original version to determine that we have a mutant which might be
    more dangerous than the original.  Ours has a different message at
    the beginning, so may behave differently than the known version.
    Once difference is the string "VIRUS_SHOE  RECORD   v9.0" shortly
    after the "Welcome to the Dungeon" message in the boot sector.

What remains to be done:

1)  A simple summary of all the useful anti-virus measures needs to be
    written and distributed to PC Users at large and all labs.
    (This should include information on other viruses and general
    protection measures.)

    This document will serve in the interim along with BRAIN.MCPART_T.

2)  Our samples of the Brain virus need to be analyzed and disassembled
    to see how it behaves relative to the original Brain.

3)  Some of the programs we have which check for and remove the brain
    virus need to be evaluated, and/or compiled, debugged, and
    distributed.  We should also check the software available on Simtel20,
    and Dave Chamber's BBS for his program V-finder.

Subject:      read-only, again

SSAT@PACEVM suggests that making command.com and the system files
read-only should be part of a virus-protection scheme.  While it
can't hurt (unless it leads to a false sense of security), and
it may prevent you from some accidents, it is trivial (a couple
dozen bytes of code) for a virus to alter a file despite the
fact that it is marked read-only.  All the viruses for PC-DOS
that I've seen in fact do this, and aren't even slowed down
by a read-only setting.

For that matter, except for the Lehigh COMMAND.COM virus, the
viruses that I've seen don't touch (or don't have to touch)
either COMMAND.COM or any of the system files.  The Jersulem
virus, for instance, spreads between normal (non-system) EXE and
COM files (I forget whether or not it will infect COMMAND.COM
given the chance; but it doesn't *have* to be able to).

So, as has been said here a couple of times before, read-only
is very very little help against viruses.

I have not heard any updates on the situation, so I assume little has changed.

   I was sent to this list by some people from another list (GAMES-L)since
I mentioned a virus on that list etc...
   It seems that our school has just been hit with what has become commonly
known as the Pakistan virus. I personally have lost MANY hours of work
to this bug. If ANYONE can help me (so that I may help others) on how
to deal with this PLEASE let me know ASAP.  The virus hit here so bad that
we made the St. Louis Post Dispatch (newspaper), Tribune (Chicago newspaper),
and a few other lesser newspapers etc...
   I work at one of the Computer Labs here at school. My job is mostly to
help people and distribute software. The problem is that our school software

has also been VERY much affected. So you can see that we are up a certain
creek without a mode of propulsion.
   Thanks for all your help in advance...

Although I can't of course know that it's the same thing that you
have, it may be somewhat comforting to know that I've seen a virus
with the "VIRUS_SHOE" wording in it, and that it proved to be exactly
identical to the standard "Brain" virus, except for the unused
text areas.  The readable parts of the boot record in the variant
that I've seen included:

     Welcome to the Dungeon  (c) 1986 Brain & Amjads (pvt) Ltd
     VIRUS_SHOE RECORD v9.0   Dedicated to the dynamic memories
     of millions of virus who are no longer with us today -
     Thanks GOODNESS !!   BEWARE OF THE er VIRUS  :  this
     program is catching    program follows after these messeges

"Thanks GOODNESS" and "messeges" are the originator's typos, not
mine!   The string "(c) Brain" had also been replaced with the
string "(c) ashar" in one place.   But all the code was identical.
I first encountered this variant in Paris, and have since seen it
in a university in Texas.

Don't be too comforted by this, of course!  It may well be that
someone has taken the original variant and added nasty things to
it.   So be very careful, and do have your technical-types dig
into it.

I am forwarding this message about LaserWriters to the list at the

  Subject: LaserWriter hacking

  Some of the LaserWriter's memory is not erased at power-down - I don't
  know the exact technology used, some sort of EPROM, I suppose.  But the
  password is stored in it.  It is possible to change the password (null
  in most networks) over the AppleTalk so that only you can use the
  printer.  The only fix is to send the machine back for a new, blank,
  EPROM, since the password protects the printer against future attempts
  at password modification.

  I haven't done this; I know about it from someone who worked out how to
  do it but refrained from trying the experiment.

A little info about memory: most computer memory these days is comple-
mentary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology.  Because of power
and price, dynamic memory is used for storage.  Dynamic memory must be
periodically refreshed, or it forgets things.  Since this refreshing
process requires external logic or an active processor, static memory is
used for non-volatile applications.  Static memory does not need to be
refreshed, but tends to use more power.  So CMOS low-power (LP) static
memory is used; these devices have an inactive low-power mode that can be
maintained for a long time with an onboard battery power supply.

EPROMs cannot be re-written after having been programmed, unless they are
erased with ultraviolet light.  Many distribution EPROMs these days can
never be erased, since they are encased in solid epoxy carriers.  These
devices are technically PROMs, however, they are the same devices as the
EPROMs, in cheaper packaging.  Eraseable EPROMs come in ceramic carriers
with a quartz window on top.

EEPROMs can be electrically erased, so they may be used on a board as
non-volatile memory, but the support circuitry required to erase them and
reprogram them makes such applications impractical.  In fact, EEPROMs
themselves are pretty impractical, and not widely used.  The support
circuitry required to program a simple EPROM is impractical as well.
Programming any kind of EPROM typically requires a 21V or 25V power
supply, and most computers don't need such voltages for any other pur-
pose.  So onboard EPROM programmers are also quite rare.

Here are a few acronyms:
CMOS:    complementary metal-oxide semiconductor
CMOS-LP: complementary metal-oxide semiconductor - low power
PROM:    programmable read-only memory
EPROM:   eraseable programmable read-only memory
EEPROM:  electrically eraseable programmable read-only memory

A virus does not actually have to _damage_ the hardware; it may achieve
the same results by programming it to operate it in such a manner that
it appears damaged. For example, suppose a PostScript trojan causes
black and white streaks to appear at random on printed pages; you're
going to have your printer serviced, and it'll cost you the same (in
terms of time and money) as if it were broken. Or, a virus might
create bad sectors on a hard disk, causing you to replace the disk. The
possibilities are endless, and it's much easier to do (and hence more
dangerous) than outright hardware damage.
