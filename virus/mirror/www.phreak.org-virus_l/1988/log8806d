I have seen the term 'worm' defined as:  "originally developed by systems
programmers to tap unused network resources to run large computer programs.
The worm would search the network for idle computing resources and use them to
execute a program in small segments.  Built in mechanisms would be responsible
for maintaining the worm, finding free machines, and replicating the program.
Worms can tie up all the computing resources on a network and essentially shut
it down.  A worm is normally activated every time the system is booted up."

   What would be the point? As I  understand it, the worm is supposed to
use  otherwise  unused  computing  resources  to  do  a  time  consuming
computation,  AND  return  the  result  when  you  are  done.  In  a  PC
environment however, how would the programmer ever be assured of getting
the result back  (and for that matter, keep getting  the results back in
various states of  completion for the next twenty years,  due to copies,
etc).

   You  may want  to note  here, that  I cannot  understand the  idea of
writing a virus (I can understand logic bombs, worms, etc., but viri are
just plain malignant, and I can't  understand that one at all), where as
a worm  actually has (can potentially  have, and don't tell  me viri can
too, I read the discussion a week  or two back on the virus that updated
the OS on the  disks, and I loved the idea),  a constructive purpose, so
my view may be just a touch slanted... :-).

there is NO good reason to use a virus to update a disk/disks.  Maybe
I want to keep a copy of the earlier version of whatever,  such a
virus would update or change stuff for me without my permission.
Maybe the update is worse than the original.  Why must I change?

Maybe you don't recall the details of the constructive virus sjb was
referring to.  It contained self-replicating code and patches for the
operating system it ran on.  When it encountered an old version of the
operating system, it would execute the patches and install itself on
the fixed version.  I believe it asked the user before altering the
boot disk.  I, for one, hate updating software on all the disks it might
be living on, and I love the idea of software that updates itself.

  [ description of a worm omitted ]

>Question:  Is anyone aware of this type of virus in a PC environment?

There was a paper by Metcalfe and Boggs of Xerox PARC written back in the early
days of Ethernet that described a worm program they built using ALTOS pcs.

In the experiments they describe, willing PC owners left their systems running
a memory diagnostic at night.  The worm program could recognize such systems,
and acquire them via a network bootstrap.  One incarnation of the worm used
its' segments to break the computation of a graphic image into pieces, compute
the image in a parallel fashion, and display it at some location.  All was very
above board, useful, and non-destructive.  I believe they even found some
unexpected benefits, such as locating malfunctioning hardware by the exercise
given it at night.

If I can find the paper I'll post a reference.

The reason I posted the request for information on PC-based worms is that
I am preparing a paper on viruses for distribution to our computer audit
executives.  It will provide them with the background to help clients when
they ask them about viruses.  The glossary will include a definition of 'worm'.

S. John Banner writes that a worm is designed to use otherwise unused computing
resources.  I view Computer Security's definition as implying that a worm would
monopolize resources, thereby slowing down the entire system's throughput.

I again ask for comment, with this in mind.

I have heard of something along this line.  I went to a seminar
about it, but I cannot remember the name of the researcher or
his university.  Perhaps I could be persuaded to look it up if
anyone is interested.

Anyway, the system is a replacement for Ultrix on Vax minicomputers.
A specialized kernel allows jobs to be submitted for remote processing.
The site in question has many Vaxes, which all look the same at the
machine language level.  Any machine that has been idle for 15 minutes
is made to run one of the submitted jobs.  When the user starts to
use the Vax again, the job is breakpointed and swapped out, to be
restarted when another processor becomes free.  They have supposedly
recovered hundreds of hours of computer time per month with this system.

Since the list owner is very active on this list, he'll probably remove
you.

However, for future reference the command is SIGNOFF VIRUS-L.
You should have received some sort of error message from ListServ, though.

a Destruct option?

I firmly believe that viruses can be used constructively, both in human

Italics are mine. If the worm is designed to truly use unused resources, one
of the things it would have to do to be "friendly" would be automatic load
checking. If it found it was actually cutting into someone's time, it would
delete that segment of itself.

If you look in this comic you find a 2-page Toshiba ad, in particular for the
T1000 which has MS-DOS in ROM. Very handy for travelling to have it boot up
immediately (one less floppy to lose or spill gin on).

Of perhaps more relevance to the list in the same mag is an expose written by
Jerry Pournells about viruses and vaccines, a couple of pages long (P. 197).
Quite a cogent and well written summary. Nothing we don't already know I
suspect but useful for the computer-literate who may only have seen accounts
in the popular press.

Cliff Stoll gave a talk at SLAC yesterday, entitled "What to feed a Trojan
Horse", the same I think as he gave at Decus last December. At that time he
held 1000 or so people spellbound and definitely raised the conciousness of
those people about the problem. He told the story of a grad student who had
lost several months of his work because a hacker had changed ONE STATEMENT of
his program, giving pi a value of 6.0 instead of 3.1415.... (Cliff was
credited with months of patient work to unmask the Chaos hackers).

>Are Tandy 1??? vulnerable?

In general, the more fixed the media, the more difficult to infect.
Therefore, copies of the operating system on ROM will be more difficult
to infect than copies stored in other media.

However, making the operating system more difficult to infect does not
make the machine immune.  Perpetrators of viruses are attracted to the
operating system in general, and COMMAND.COM in particular, because it
it is an easy solution to the problem of getting their code executed.
However, there are a number of solutions to that problem.

Therefore, the answer to your question is that yes, Tandy 1??? are
vulnerable, but perhaps marginally less so to viruses that are specific
to COMMAND.COM.

True, if the changer knows what polynomial is being used for the CRC.
However, use of two or more independent polynomials should make it much
more difficult.  The more independent virus checkers with different
polynomials there are, the harder it will be for the virus builders.

If not, I would never buy such a machine.  One could not take
advantage of upgrades to Dos.  I suppose it may allow either
the Rom version or a diskette version, which would be okay.
That would speed up booting (when you do not need the later
versions).  I wonder if all the commands on the Dos disk are
in Rom too.  Maybe they were just referring to the normal
Rom-Bios, in which case their advertisement may be misleading.

The T1000 (from Toshiba) has everything in ROM (the whole OS), as well as all
the standard commands. In fact, it has a ROM-disk (the A-disk as I recall) as
well that you can DIR and see all the normal files you would see when DIR-ing
any standard system disk. This frees up your floppy on a one-drive machine to
be all data. I think it keeps COMMAND.COM in CMOS or something. You can also
boot from floppy if you really wish to.

The operating system in ROM? Boy, Microsoft had better get the OS right the
first time, as bug fixes would be somewhat difficult.

  Actually, Tandy's Color Computer has a 3-Level ROM BASIC/DOS. The first
level is a bare-bones BASIC interpreter, the second level adds many features
to BASIC (graphics, sound, etc) and the third level adds Disk commands and
file management (also in ROM). Each of these levels is another ROM to plug in.

  How is this possible? Bare-bones BASIC defines a whole slough of vectors in
RAM that are initialized to RETurns. These vectors are placed in stategic
routines (like character input/output, parsing) so that higher levels can
reset these vectors to their own handlers.

  Another thing about the Coco is that is possible to switch off the ROM and
use the RAM underneath-- this can be used to make radical changes to the
operating system, or possible to use a totally different operating system like
OS-9 or FLEX. Upgrading a ROM-based system is possible.

  The key thing that makes virus transmission difficult is the lack of
bootstrapping-- the virus does not have a sure way of getting into the machine
in the first place- the operator has to specifically execute the infected
program.

Hi folks,

some of you may think that writing viruses for a IBM mainframe
running VM/CMS requires access to the mainframe for testing the
code. Failed!!

A potential virus-writer has (at least) two possibilities to
develop VM viruses at his PC at home:

     .   Buy a XT/AT/370 computer (price approx. $5000). Throw
         away the VM/PC operating system IBM offers for this system.
         Get (means *steel*) a copy of VM/SP 4.0 (or even 5.0) and
         put it onto your own system (This really works: I *konw*
         a person who did exactly this!!). Copy the ASMH and all
         MACLIBs from the mainframe and develop you own VM virus.

     .   Get the (ShareWare) package called PC370 (from PC-SIG
         disk#402) written by Don Higgins (a former IBM'er? He
         wrote a lot of macros for the IBM/370 system as I found
         out when I looked at the MACLIBs available at our mainframe).
         Expand the program to handle macro-expansion and adapt all
         macros you need for the virus to run under MS-DOS. Develop
         your virus.

Of course the first option is the better one - all you need is to
buy a XT/AT/370 and to steel a VM/CMS to develop a virus that can
cause *MUCH MORE* harm than PC viruses.

How can we face this problem ????

Subject:      OS in ROM


The idea of putting the operating system (and perhaps other important
executables) in ROM is interesting, although not a new one.  I saw a
product a while back for IBM PC (or compats) that would allow the user
to do exactly that - burn a ROM with whatever file(s) (s)he wishes, and
use them as if they were coming from a floppy disk.  I can't remember
the name of the product, but I recall that it came in a couple of
different capacity configurations of approx. 360k up to about 1/2 Meg.
This idea would appear to be functionally equivalent to what Disk
Defender does - recall that Disk Defender is a commercial product that
allows the user to physically lock part or all of his/her hard disk
from all write attempts.

In all of these instances, there are a couple things that we must
remember.  First, a virus need not limit itself to infecting the operating
system; it could easily infect any executable file.  Second, if there
is a way for the user to update the software in the write-protected
storage, then there *is* a way for a virus to get there as well.  With
Disk Defender, for example, there is a switch which toggles the write
protection.  During the time that you're updating any software in the
read-only portion of the disk, a virus could conceivably be copied
as well.  In the case of Tandy's ROM DOS (if this is the case), only
Tandy, or a person with access to a ROM burner, would be able to alter
the contents of the ROM.  This could be seen as good and bad, for obvious
reasons.

I'd see a product like a ROM disk as being useful primarily for its
speed and convenience because, unlike a RAM disk, the software is
always there.  It ought not be viewed as a sole virus protection scheme
due to the fact that other files may be infected.  It probably does,
however, reduce the chance of becoming infected somewhat.  The Brain
virus would probably have a real tough time getting onto the ROM...  :-)

that most viruses don't live in the operating system at all!  The
Lehigh virus (that started all this discussion) does, but none of

Bernd Fix asks
> How can we face this problem ????

I think the answer is "about the same way we're facing the problem
for microcomputers".   That is, identify the executable objects in
the VM/CMS environment, and write programs that do the best we
can to detect unauthorized changes in them.  Since the typical
VM/CMS machine is a bit faster than the typical micro, a good
CRC-check (preferably with a nice long user-chosen polynomial)
of every vulnerable executable becomes a more attractive option.
The outline of a virus-detector that I suggested above could
easily be modified for VM/CMS.   The main difficulty that I see
is that there's no counterpart to keeping the checker, and the
database, in a locked file cabinet between runs.   Perhaps
keep them DES encrypted instead?   (And of course re-IPL
and "ACC ( NOPROF" before using the detector.)
  Viruses on mainframes are not very different in kind from
viruses on micros (somewhat oversimplified statement offered
as a basis for discussion!).

This probably will demonstrate my lack of knowledge about DOS more
than anything, but here goes...I used CHK4BOMB on a file I received
from a friend which draws a picture of a naked female on the screen.
It is called MISS-DV.COM. CHK4BOMB gave the message that the program
uses ROM BIOS routines and should not be run until I consulted an
expert. Is there any reason that a program which supposedly uses a
digitized image (from 5 data files labelled SCR0...SCR4.SCR) would need
to access ROM BIOS? The program also lists the BBSs from which you can
supposedly get more. I know the Macintosh has a ROM toolbox which
users can access to draw graphics, and I was just wondering whether
DOS has the same sort of setup.
(P.S. I am getting Peter Norton's books on MS/PC-DOS and Assembly language
so I won't have to ask questions like this any more!)

As for infecting boot sectors, that IS infecting the DOS, since the DOS
is normally loaded off the boot tracks.

It's really not much harder to send out a ROM chip set update than it is
to send out floppies.  Really.  So I don't think DOSes in ROMs are any
kind of problem as far as updates and bug fixes go; that is, any more
problem than MS-DOS computers already inflict by having BIOS in ROM --
a primitive and annoying feature.  Anybody out there ever use CP/M?
BIOS gets loaded with OS off boot tracks.  This allows you to FIX your
BIOS if you don't like it.  And boy have I ever disliked some BIOSes
in the past.

It truly works.  The use of a user-chosen polynomial will make the
defeat of the virus very likely.  There is no way for the writer of
the virus to know what polynomial the user is working with, and
therefore no way to know just what to put in his code to compromise
the calculation.  As long as we agree to disagree, that is to all use
arbitrary polynomials, there is good chance of catching this sort of
virus.

I recently (april?) posted a package called filetest that ran CRC
on selected files.  I can permit the user to enter his/her own CRC
formula and can also check the boot block of the default disk.  This
does correctly find changes in any desired exec or com files, or the
system files.  It should be effective, but only reports after the
fact.  Any takers?

I have just received a new program from RSA Data Security, Inc.  The

TO:       MAILSAFE COMMAND LINE Users
FROM:     RSA Data Security Inc.
SUBJECT:  Authentication of MSCL executable program
DATE:     11 May 1988

In order to insure protection from viruses and integrity
of data we have added a Digital Signature to the end of
MSCL.EXE, the MAILSAFE COMMAND LINE executable program.
The appended signature does not interfere in any way with
the loading or execution of the MSCL program and therefore
need not be removed in order to use the product.  The
signature was produced using the RSADATA7 private key and
should be easily verifiable using the RSADATA7 public key
that was included with your standard MAILSAFE product.  If
you are using an older version of MAILSAFE or you do not
have access to this public key please contact RSA Data
Security for a copy.

To verify the authenticity of the MAILSAFE COMMAND LINE
executable program MSCL.EXE, simply verify the appended
signature using the VERIFY option in MAILSAFE COMMAND LINE
or the standard MAILSAFE product.  If you have not already
done so, you should CERTIFY the RSADATA7 public key in
order to consider the signature VALID and CERTIFIED.  If,
after certifying the RSADATA7 pubilc key, the signature on
the end of the file MSCL.EXE is not VALID and CERTIFIED,
do not use the MAILSAFE COMMAND LINE product and contact
RSA Data Security Inc. for further assistance.

[end of attachment]

The seal is computed by encrypting the file under the Data Encryption
Standard, taking the 128 bit residue and encrypting that under the
private key.  There has not yet been sufficient time since the big bang
to find another file of that length, that will do anything at all as a
program and yield the same 128 bit DES residue, much less anything in
particular.

While this mechanism cannot protect you from accepting a virus from a
trusted source, it will permit you to know exactly where it came from.

Incidentally, RSA is negotiating with some INTERNET committee to make
their product standard and available on the net.

Re:   Atul Butte's proposal for "tamper-proof packaging" for software to
prevent dissemination of software viruses (Comp.sys.mac Sun, 08 May 88):

      Butte proposes a variation on the one-way encryption functions of
public key cryptography schemes which could encrypt software in a way
that ensures that the software actually came straight from the vendor.
He also suggests that the decryption key could somehow be provided along
with the encrypted software.  His proposal is interesting, and seems
viable in its overall framework, but one detail is problematic.  One
cannot distribute the decryption key with the encrypted software:  any
evil hacker could create such a package, encrypting virus-infected
software and supplying his own key.  The decryption keys must be
publicly posted in such a way that the consumer could have absolute
confidence that they belong to a reputable firm, while the firm is
responsible for ensuring that they alone know how to encrypt for their
publicly posted decryption key.

      Incidentally, Butte's scheme would seem to have implications for
preventing software bootlegging.  The vendor could supply the decryption
key only to customers with proof of purchase.  Bootleggers would have to
risk virus infection.  Vendors might even be motivated to distribute
infected bootleg copies around the marketplace, so as to heighten demand
for the genuine article.  Of course, they could do that even without
tamper-proof packaging...

  My feeling is that it will enhance the transmission of virii.  I've been using
the quasi-multitasking environment of Multifinder for the mac for some time
now, and even though I'm using floppies, the mac is rarely shut off.  This
means that extra CPU time can be stolen from processes to other, unauthorized
processes.
  Hey, personally, there are a couple of worms (not the destructive
kind) I'd like to be running -- and on the vaxes at work I burn about 40
cpu-hours a day on my state space searches.  Anyway, as someone on virus-l
has already pointed out (I think in reference to the amiga multitasking
environment) when you have extra CPU time running around more-or-less
undetectibly, a virus suddenly has the resources to do incredible CRC
computations or the like.  The advantage is not 'goes dormant until
April 1, 1992'; you can do that today with a counter.  But multitasking means
the environment has 24 CPU-hours resource per day to play with, and if the
virus steals just 1% of that it is enough to for the virus to be quite
clever.
  What it seems to boil down to is this: virii are a fact of life.  If we
are going to detect them and prevent their transmission, we have to observe
them in either time or space.  If you use a hard disk environment, without
some sophisticated data verification processes (maybe a DAEMON that records
changes to data?) it is not easy to detect the virii in space.  With
multitasking, it is not easy to detect the virii in time.  So, yes, expect
more ubiquitous and virulent virii as environments become more sophisticated
and powerful.

Well, assuming it had the option of software update with user prompt-
ing, you wouldn't have to worry about it being automatically replaced.
This was already discussed.  Also discussed was the ability to boot
from a disk instead of ROM, if so desired.  So whatsa prob?

Anyway, DOS is not subject to this situation, since it doesn't have
warm boots (as far as I know).  The only boot is a full operating

Sounds like that could be an effective way of ensuring mail integrity.
How about all data transfers on the Internet?  I assume that the scheme
which you pointed out is just for SMTP.  That leaves FTPs up for grabs.
It'll also be interesting to see how they'll implement that on dissimilar
machines with dissimilar mail interfaces.  VMS MAIL, for example, uses
non-ASCII format mail files which can get real annoying.

Many of the questions you raise about "privacy enhanced mail" are answered in
RFC-1040.

The RFC can be obtained via FTP from SRI-NIC.ARPA with the pathname
RFC:RFC1040.TXT. Log in with FTP username ANONYMOUS and password GUEST. The NIC
also provides an automatic mail service for those sites which cannot use FTP.
Address the request to SERVICE@SRI-NIC.ARPA and in the subject field of the

I do not like being prompted during my boot sequence.  I have a
'nightime' boot sequence which parks the disk should the machine
lose power when I am away.  A prompt would definitely cause
problems in that case, and generally slow me down while rebooting,
which sometimes occurs frequently.

Nonsense.  Virii are only a problem because we insist upon running programs
that pretend that the whole machine is theirs to use.  These programs
wouldn't have been written if Microsoft didn't have their heads up their
collective asses.

Why do people write directly to the communication ports?
Because Microsoft didn't provide a real driver.
Why do people write directly to the screen?
Because Microsoft didn't provide a capable interface.
Why do people write directly to the disk?
Because Microsoft didn't provide a real operating system.

There is no hope for the 8088.  But Microsoft *could* have written a
real operating system for the 80286.  Maybe OS 1/2 provides sufficient
protection to keep programs like the Norton Utilities from working.  But
so long as people run programs inside of the compatability box, we will
have PC virii.

You want protection from virii?  Run Unix (or VMS or VM but remember
that the only one of the three that you can run right now is Unix).
Has anyone noticed the resounding lack of Unix viruses?

Subject:      Monthly greeting from Ken


[ Last modified 28-June-88 - Ken van Wyk ]

Welcome!  This is the monthly introduction posting for VIRUS-L,
primarily for the benefit of any newcomers.  Apologies to all
subscribers who've already read this in the past (you'll only have to
see it once a month and you can, if you're quick, press the purge
key...:-).


What is VIRUS-L?

It is an electronic mail discussion forum for sharing information
about computer viruses.  Discussions should include (but not
necessarily be limited to): current events (virus sightings), virus
prevention (practical and theoretical), and virus questions/answers.
The list is non-moderated and non-digested.  That means that any
message coming in goes out immediately.  Weekly logs of submissions
are kept for those people who prefer digest format lists (see below
for details on how to get them).


What isn't VIRUS-L?

A place to spread hype about computer viruses; we already have the
Press for that.  :-)  A place to sell things, to panhandle, or to
flame other subscribers.  If anyone *REALLY* feels the need to flame
someone else for something that they may have said, then the flame
should be sent directly to that person and/or to the list moderator
(that'd be me, <LUKEN@LEHIIBM1.BITNET>).


How do I get on the mailing list?

Well, if you're reading this, chances are *real good* that you're
already on the list.  However, perhaps this document was given to you
by a friend or colleague...  So, to get onto the VIRUS-L mailing list,
send a mail message to <LISTSERV@LEHIIBM1.BITNET>.  In the body of the
message, say nothing more than SUB VIRUS-L your name.  LISTSERV is a
program which automates mailing lists such as VIRUS-L.  As long as
you're either on BITNET, or any network accessible to BITNET via
gateway, this should work.  Within a short time, you will be placed on
the mailing list, and you will get confirmation via e-mail.


How do I get OFF of the list?

If, in the unlikely event, you should happen to want to be removed from
the VIRUS-L discussion list, just send mail to
<LISTSERV@LEHIIBM1.BITNET> saying SIGNOFF VIRUS-L.  People, such as
students, whose accounts are going to be close (like over the
summer...) - PLEASE signoff of the list before you leave.  Also, be
sure to send your signoff request to the LISTSERV and not to the list
itself.


How do I send a message to the list?

Just send electronic mail to <VIRUS-L@LEHIIBM1.BITNET> and it will
automatically be redistributed to everyone on the mailing list.  By
default, you will NOT receive a copy of your own letters.  If you wish
to, send mail to <LISTSERV@LEHIIBM1.BITNET> saying SET VIRUS-L REPRO


What does VIRUS-L have to offer?

All submissions to VIRUS-L are stored in weekly log files which can be
downloaded by any user on (or off) the mailing list.  There is also a
small archive of some of the public anti-virus programs which are
currently available.  This archive, too, can be accessed by any user.
All of this is handled automatically by the LISTSERV here at Lehigh
University (<LISTSERV@LEHIIBM1.BITNET>).


How do I get files from the LISTSERV?

Well, you'll first want to know what files are available on the
LISTSERV.  To do this, send mail to <LISTSERV@LEHIIBM1.BITNET> saying
INDEX VIRUS-L.  Note that filenames/extensions are separated by a
space, and not by a period.  Once you've decided which file(s) you
want, send mail to <LISTSERV@LEHIIBM1.BITNET> saying GET filename
filetype.  For example, GET VIRUS-L LOG8804 would get the file called
VIRUS-L LOG8804 (which happens to be the monthly log of all messages
sent to VIRUS-L during April, 1988).  Note that, starting June 6, 1988,
the logs are weekly.  The new file format is VIRUS-L LOGyymmx where
yy is the year (88, 89, etc.), mm is the month, and x is the week
(A, B, etc.).  Readers who prefer digest format lists should read
the weekly logs and sign off of the list itself.  Subsequent submissions
to the list should be sent to me for forwarding.


What is uuencode/uudecode, and why do I need them?

Uuencode and uudecode are two programs which convert binary files into
text (ASCII) files and back again.  This is so binary files can be
easily transferred via electronic mail.  Many of the files on this
LISTSERV are binary files which are stored in uuencoded format (the
file types will be UUE).  Both uuencode and uudecode are available from
the LISTSERV.  Uudecode is available in BASIC and in Turbo Pascal here.
Uuencode is available in Turbo Pascal.  Also, there is a very good
binary-only uuencode/uudecode package on the LISTSERV which is stored
in uuencoded format.


Why have posting guidelines?

To keep the discussions on-track with what the list is intended to be;
a vehicle for virus discussions.  This will keep the network traffic
to a minimum and, hopefully, the quality of the content of the mail to
a maximum.  No one wants to read personal flames ad nausium, or
discussions about the pros and cons of digest-format mailing lists,
etc.



What are the guidelines?

     As already stated, there will be no flames on the list.  Anyone
     sending flames to the entire list must do so knowing that he/she
     will be removed from the list immediately.

     Same goes for any commercial plugs or panhandling.

     Submissions should be directly or indirectly related to the
     subject of computer viruses.

     Responses to queries should be sent to the author of the query,
     not to the entire list.  The author should then send a summary
     of his/her responses to the list at a later date.

     "Automatic answering machine" programs (the ones which reply
     to e-mail for you when you're gone) should be set to *NOT*
     reply to VIRUS-L.  Such responses sent to the entire list
     are very rude and will be treated as such.

     When sending in a submission, try to see whether or not someone
     else may have just said the same thing.  This is particularly
     important when responding to someone else's posting (which should
     be sent to that person *anyway*).  It's very easy to get multiple
     messages saying the exact same thing.  No one wants this to
     happen.

Thank-you for your time and for your adherance to these guidelines.
Comments and suggestions, as alway, are invited.  Please address them
to me, <LUKEN@LEHIIBM1.BITNET> or <LUKEN@VAX1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU>.

This is a misconception; viruses do not have to talk directly to the
hardware to function, and standard access controls (privileges,
protected kernals, etc), do little or nothing to slow them down.
One reason viruses are so dangerous is that they need do nothing
unauthorized; they spread by altering objects that the user is
authorized to alter.  See Fred Cohen's original paper

       Fred Cohen, "Computer Viruses: Theory and Experiment",
       Computers & Security, Vol. 6 (1987) pp. 22-35

if you think Unix(tm) is somehow immune from viruses...  This
isn't to say anything against Unix; I don't know of -any-
general-purpose operating system that has any protection
against them.   The only reason we've seen so many viruses
for micro opsystems is that the typical virus-writer has
a micro.

Hi folks,

I don't agree that there are "constructive viruses". All things
these viruses are supposed to do can be done (more easily) by
using normal programs or extensions of the operating system (e.g.
data compression,...). The fact is that a virus has to *alter*
existing executables even if it is a "good" virus. I don't want
other persons to alter my programs (via viruses) because they may
cause side effects on my software. I something went wrong with my
programs *I* want to be responsable for the errors...
Some people say: 'The virus should ask the user if he wants his
program to be infected by this "good" virus.' I don't want to be
asked silly questions all the time either.

By the way:  .  If you buy a software package and you have problems
                with it, I think the software house can refuse to
                give support if the software is altered by an (even)
                "good" virus.
             .  At least here in Germany it is a crime (Para. 303a,b
                StGB - computer sabotage) to spread a (constructive)
                virus *BECAUSE* it alters existing programs.

I do believe the tale of "constructive viruses" is spread by virus
programmers who want to legitimate their doing.

All the best,
Bernd.

     Things like computer virii(sp?) will not disappear simply because
you're running on a operating system that provides some memory protection.
Take Unix for instance.  Once someone has managed to get superuser
priv. then the writing of a virus is within the realm of possibility.
Any operating system is going to have security holes which the malicious
user will take advantage of.  A simple OS means that you will have simple
virii to deal with  and a complex OS means...
     What examples can people think of virus type programs on mini- and
mainframe Op. systems?  If any, how do they differ from the current crop
nasties in the PC world?

It would only happen if you were booting from a disk with an old
version of the operating system on it.  Which is rare, and probably
doesn't happen with your nighttime boot sequence.

The operating system update virus works by living in the RAM-resident
version of the operating system.  When a warm boot is executed,
the operating system looks at the boot tracks on the new disk.  If
the boot tracks have an old version of the operating system on them,
it offers to update it for you.  A cold boot would defeat this
purpose since it would purge the operating system from RAM and load
the new one from disk without looking.  Possibly the CRTL-ALT-DEL
vector could be modified to check on cold boots as well, but this
would be unwise, since a cold boot frequently means a trashed
operating system anyway.  And who wants to turn off the stupid machine
and wait for the idiot memory test to cycle again?  (As if your
memory chips are real likely to die every time you turn the machine
off.)  Note that I refer to the normal CRTL-ALT-DEL procedure as a
cold boot; it's certainly nothing like a warm boot.  To me, the power-
up sequence is a frozen boot.

The constructive virus I have been talking about (which was mentioned
initially by someone else, I forget whom) is a method of updating an
operating system.  It can NOT be done "more easily" by using "normal
programs", whatever that means.  The only side effects are an updated
version of the operating system.  If this wreaks havoc in your software,
the operating system was not upward compatible.  It only asks you "silly
questions" when you warm boot from a disk whose version of the operating
system hasn't been updated.

The virus under discussion is DISTRIBUTED by the software house.

What are you trying to say?  Hmm?

One little point about Unix viruses: most code distribution on ARPANET
is via source code, not object code, since Unix runs on MANY DIFFERENT
MACHINES.  Few Unix machines have compatible instruction sets, so it
is usually necessary to distribute source.  It is difficult to hide
viruses in programs if the source code is sitting there in plain view.
Micro-users, on the other hand, are always trading object code on
disks, or downloading object code from BBSs.

In-Reply-To:  Your message of Mon, 27 Jun 88 14:05:00 URZ

I concur.  The question of whether there can be a constructive
virus is similar to whether or not self-altering code (in the
sense of the Cobol ALTER verb or assembler code that writes on
top of itself) is ever okay.  Anything constructive a virus can
do can be done by more standardized software.

On the issue of laws against even benign viruses, the freedom of
speech guarantee in the US constitution may be invoked by some
authors in defense of their actions.  This is probably a weak
defense, since viruses are propagated on private machines.  However,
a benevolent virus on a public network may be protected.  The snag
is that it is hard to PROVE things about software.  The CHRISTMA
virus, propagated last year, seemed benevolent to its author.   Other
programmers may design viruses that they THINK are benevolent, but
turn out to be nasty in terms (for example) of network traffic.

We need to be able to talk about viruses and create them.  The
only safe way is the simulated machine, a technique which seems to have
fallen into disuse.  Olivieri and Rubin's COMPUTERS AND PROGRAMMING:
A Neoclassical Approach is the only recent venture in this genre, and
it is ten years old.  Students, in my experience, hate artificial
machines, since they can't tell potential employers about real experience.
However, simulated machines teach the real issues of assembler programming
and (as I said) provide a safe lab for virus experimentation.

In-Reply-To:  Your message of Fri, 24 Jun 88 10:23:01 EDT

Identifying the executable objects in a VM/CMS environment, as David
M. Chess recommends in a recent posting, may be difficult.  The EXECLOAD
command allows you to load a file of any type as an EXEC.  Therefore,
you must take the text of the file into account.  For example, an EXEC
is any file starting with &TRACE (EXEC-2 language), any file starting
with /* comment */ (REXX), or any file with "a lot of" words starting
with ampersands (EXEC-1 language).  Similar rules could be cooked up
for MODULEs.

However, I could conceive of a situation where a compiler writer acts
in cahoots with a virus writer.  The virus writer distributes an
innocuous-looking data file. The vicious compiler wakes up, looks for
the data file, and (iff it finds it) interprets the data therein as
object code in some artificial language.  The analogy to "binary"
chemical weapons is obvious: in such weapons, two harmless substances
are brought together to create a dangerous substance.  The "compiler
writer" could be any writer of any sort of generally-useful software.

Yes, but in the situation, if your machine reboots, you shouldn't be
getting any sort of prompts that you don't expect, as that version of
the OS will think that it is the latest, and therefor will have no
reason prompt you for anything (unless of course you have some software
that will prompt you for some other reason).  I too dislike prompts
during a boot you see, but having a DOS that would update itself
(assuming of course that it prompts you before actually doing anything)
would certainly save a lot of time.  And as to the person who said that
it would be great, untill something went wrong, well, I have had fun
installing new versions of DOS (read reformat of harddrive required),
but I still install new versions of DOS when they come out; in my opinion
the added convniance is well worth the possible hastles...

Personally, I don't feel all that secure about source code.  On one of my
subdirectories dealing with a research project, I've several dozen pascal
programs and dozens of include files, each only a dozen K each, but you get
the idea.  Now suppose I write a procedure that will call upon the system
to find me all the text files with extensions of .PAS or .INC that my
process has the ability to write to, and then with some low probability
search for the key word "procedure".  Between the next var and the end of
the procedure I edit the file to be this procedure I'm writing...  a virus.
Guess what?  The program still compiles, since the headers match.  When it
is compiled and executed, the user propagates the virus.

Now very few system service calls are made - just a little directory work.
All done through the normal operating system, no violation of the "usual"
guidelines for programming.  My best "Intro to Pascal" students could write
this thing.  Note that any block comment after the  procedure is preserved,
so that to a cursory scan, the structure of the program is preserved.
Probably, the programming style of the virus writer and the person writing
the file would be different, so that an examination based upon reading the
file would detect the difference, but...  hey, I probably have fifty or so
files the program could infect.  I don't carefully read things before
editing - I get an idea, then make that small change, and recompile and go.
I could easily be hit by this sort of virus.

Jefferson Ogata says that "it is difficult to hide... in plain view".  I'm
not convinced.  If I recieve source for a neato-keeno chess program, say
10K lines, I'm going to compile and run it once or twice before I've
completed my examination of it.  (Bad hygiene, perhaps, but I'm a sloppy
human.) Once I've been hit, *if* I detect it before someone borrows a
program of mine, I still have to search through ALL of my pascal sources to
find the virus. Its in plain view, but there is just too much to examine,
and it is too difficult to know which source is contaminated and which is
not.
