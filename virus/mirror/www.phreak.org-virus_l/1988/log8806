Thomas, is it really a virus, or is it a Trojan horse? This is important --
if it's a virus, it does its damage at some later date, after ensuring that
it ahs spread to other systems. If it is a Trojan horse (as I would guess
from your description), then it clobbers you immediately, without spreading
itself. I know it sounds picky, but the viruses are a lot worse, since they
can inhabit ANYTHING. Trojans merely need to be avoived by name.

Well, I once tried disconnecting the power from the hard disk
and booting from diskette.  I do not remember the precise outcome,
but I think I was unable to boot.  You may have more luck by
removing the hard disk controller entirely, but you run the
risk of damaging your equipment.  I heard (do not ask me where)
of someone putting a switch on their hard disk connection, to
write protect it.  Even the reference I saw did not tell how
to do it.  When I tried to reenable the hard disk, I had an
extra cable that had come loose, with three identical connectors
available.  I was rather embarrased to have to wait for another
employee to identify the correct connection.  The moral is:
BE CAREFUL!

>
>2) Is it possible to design a virus that screws up the ROM?

Not under usual circumstances.  Most ROMS are only writable
by equipment external to the computer.  There are EEPROMS
which can be written by the computer, though.  They are
commonly used in some terminals (perhaps a VT100?) to store
the setup parameters, even while the terminal is powered off.
The new PS/2 line features CMOS memory to contain setup
information, with a battery backup.  Some errant programs
have been known to trash this memory, which can be easily
restored with the Reference Diskette.

Subject: Info regarding the National Computer Security Division

Ken,
several times, a fellow from the National Computer Security Division
(of the NSA, I believe) has posted messages emphasing that the
Division does not handle prosectutions of the virus writers,etc.
I have questions that maybe he or someone else on the VIRUS-L
could help me with....

Since I work with computers and write articles about computing and
related subjects, I was wondering what general public information
is available regarding computer security issues, what material is
available from places such as the National Computer Security Division.
Also I have about something called the "Orange Book" about computer
security. Is this a public document? And if so, how does does one
obtain a copy?

Also, is there any particular agency that is handling the investigation
and legal prosecution of virus makers?

As a guide to the background of the questions, I am looking for things
to help cut through the various rumors and half-info about viruses
and computing in general. Any informationthat I am asking for, should
relatively open to the public or the computing community. Ie.; I am
NOT lookfor sensitive info. This clarification I am making since
the computer security issues sometimes can be a very sensitive
field and although I work with governmental computing (New Jersy
State), I am not a professional computer security specialist by title.

Thank you for your help.

I have examined a package called Disk Defender, a hardware board that
claims to allow good protection for the hard disk.  It plugs into the
backplane of a PC/AT and connects, via cables between the hard disk
controller and the disk itself.  One sets switches on the board which
allow one to deny write acces to the track on the disk whose vales
fall between those switches.

Included with the package is a software procedure which permits you to
configure your hard disk with drive C for example totally contained on
the protected tracks and drive D on the rest of the disk.

You may then put the software you wish to protect on drive C and other
stuff on drive D.

A cable can be attached to the defender board with a switch.  The
switch permits (1) the whole drive to be writable, (2) the whole drive
to be locked and (3) only the tracks now pointing to drive C to be
locked.  If the cable is removed, condition (3) prevails.

The entire drive must be locked, as the FAT cannot be written to if it
in the protected area and that would screw up all disk access if only
a part of the drive is locked.

The hardware seems to do what it claims.  Usual disclaimers apply, I
have never been ... 8-)

There is a lot of "general public information" available on Computer
Security.  A lot of this is available through conferences (IEEE
Symposium on Security & Privacy, NBS/NCSC National Computer Security
Conference, DoE Computer Security Conference, etc.)  that publish their
proceedings.  The IEEE proceedings should be available through
University libraries (or interlibrary loan services); I'm not sure the
NBS/NCSC NCSC is that popular, and doubt the DoE one is.

One can get the NBS/NCSC Proceedings, Orange book (AKA The Criteria, AKA
DOD 5200.28-STD), and other Government publications through the US
Government Printing Office (for the cost of publication).  Some
documents may sometimes (I don't know the criteria for giving them out)
be gotten directly through NCSC by requesting them through:  National
Computer Security Center, ATTN C1, 9800 Savage Road, Fort GG Meade, MD
20755-6000.

The FBI is the Agency charged with the responsibility for investigating
crime at the national level (naturally, your local PD or Sheriff's
office is first in line, and there is the question of jurisdiction,
etc).  Prosecution would be done through the appropriate offices, your
local DA, the Justice Department of the US, etc.

The NCSC tries very hard to promote security in the commercial (i.e.
public, i.e.  not sensitive) sector.  As noted above, they co-host a
conference that *anyone* may attend (as long as you pay the nominal fee,
of course).

Does anyone else remember the game Twister?  :-)  Does the above sequence
actually disable (if even is software) the hard disk, or does it just
make it possible to boot from a floppy?  That is, is it still possible
for a program to read/write to the hard disk after someone does the
above sequence?  (Assuming, of course, that it's physically possible to
press all of those keys at once.)

Ken

P.S. How many programmers does it take to boot a Mac SE from a floppy?  :-)

Subject:      Hard Drives




Many of you have been curious as to an easy way to disconnect
or disable your hard drive for testing programs.  Well, on
AT and similar machines, you can change the CMOS to tell your
computer that it doesn't have a hard drive.  So, drive C: will
no longer exist. Make sure you save the data in the existing CMOS
so you can put it back.  (Note: turning the computer off won't
restore the CMOS back to normal.)  I think I have a program
that does this; that is, changes, saves and restores CMOS.  I
will try to get it to the list.

Remember if you're testing software by disabling your hard drive,
you're only testing against trojans and bombs.  Time-bombs and viruses
will probably go unnoticed.  Moreover, if a trojan is specifically
designed to hit a hard drive, and if it is written well, it
will only attempt to do damage after it is sure that the hard
drive exists and is working.  So even trojans could get past by
doing nothing until a hard drive is present.

It is always possible to 'boot' from a floppy; just stick a floppy with a
system on it into the drive and restart.  However if you do just that, the hard
disk will still 'come up' and be accessible from the desk top.  The sequence I
gave will have the system come up from the floppy, but the hard disk will not
be accessible (or visible) from the desk top.

Well, that's what it is *supposed* to do for ya.  But who knows with Apple?
At any rate, to avoid all of the mangled, popped out of joint fingers
that some people who aren't too limber may get from the above sequence,
just insert a trusted floppy disk into the floppy disk drive with a trusted
system and then open the System folder on it.  Hold down the COMMAND and
the OPTION keys while double clicking on the icon of the Finder.  This
will force the mac to make use of the system on the floppy drive.  After
your finder comes back to life, close the folders, and drag the icon of the
hard drive into the trash can.  This will unmount the sucker, thereby
preventing any read/writing from/to it.  You can then make a vallient
attempt to use an unknown piece of software.  Just pray that the virus
doesn't get stored in your parameter ram, or you will be really screwed
because the battery back-up for the SE is *SOLDERED* to the mother
board.  Solution to this deal --> Run it on a Mac Plus, and if you suspect
a virus residing in your parm ram, remove the battery from the back via the
battery door.  Wait 40 seconds for all to clear and then put it back in.

Hope this helps....

All this hard disk locking stuff is fine and all, and it is a good
initial testing method for software, but Joe made a good point when
he said (something to the extent) that a virus could very easily
wait until it found a hard drive present before even attempting
to propogate.  Thus, the virus would only do damage to hard disk
based machines (or at least only propogate on them).  I know that's
what I would do *IF* I were to write a virus; go after the people who
have the most to lose.

The best solution would be to test software on a machine which has
a hard disk that is expendable.  Of course, economic reasons often
make that impractical.

Subject:      Virus-writing 101?

Thought I'd relate a recent incident to the group regarding computer virus
writing and propogation.  Apparently we have a professor who thought it would
be a good experience for his students, as a project, to write (each) a
virus, and demonstrate that it works.  OK, in my opinion we're already on
shaky ground assuming the 20 or so different viruses can remain totally
isolated within the student-instructor environment.  As you can guess,
some of them have "leaked" out of the "lab".  One report indicates that
the instructor's hard disk was erased, and another that one student's
final project was eaten by his own virus.  At least one unrelated PC was
found to be infected (in the University's Micro Resource Center!).  There
are arguments going backand forth about whether this was blatantly
irresponsible, or if viral education is a good thing.  One can't even
consider firing the instructor because he's already leaving to go to
another institution.  So, this might be a good topic to kick back and
forth for a while?  What are the ethics/legalities of such an incident?
For instance, in American law & philosophy, freedom of information is nearly
sacred; is propoagation of the knowlege on how to write a virus itself a
bad thing, or only the malicious and/or negligent spreading of one and it's
symptoms/damage?  Is the passing of this knowlege to a "random" group of
students (where the professor is probably unable to evaluate each one's
future intentions or views of morality) an unethical, if not illegal, act?

Disclaimer: The above are my views, not my employer; I have not had direct
contact with the professor or his students.

Subject:      Re: Hard disk disable

     I  recently  read  an  item  in  the  February 1988 issue of
CONNECTIVITY, the British IBM-PC User Group Journal. I  feel that
a  couple  of  points  made  in  the  item may be relevant to the
ongoing discussion on the list. Two ways were mentioned:
.................................................................
Extract from CONNECTIVITY (Feb/1988) pg23 : Dr Solomon's Surgery,
in response to a query from  Charles Guy  re write  protecting 30
XT's, each with a 20Mb hard disk:

1.   "...replace INT  13H with  your own version that filters out
any disk writes."

2.  "...make up a cable for the  hard disk  that disables writing
to it...(by cutting) one of the lines in the cable."
.................................................................
     I'm not  sure how  effective item  1 would be, as presumably
any virus, being software, can 'untrap' the trap, as it were, and
still get  on with  its dastardly deeds. Item 2 seems more likely
to be effective, but, as the article points out, would  require a
special  cable  for  the  administrator  to  be  able  to  do his
necessary routine updates, etc. This could  mean an  all-night or
all-weekend job  in a  large teaching lab with numerous hard-disc
machines.
     I don't know which of the  lines is  the WRITE  line (no pun
intended!) but  surely it  would be  feasible to extend this line

know that in our setup, the keyboard locks on each PC are more or

the admin guy would just have a master key, no  cables or messing

I believe that it would most certainly do so.  How would you be able
to update your disk directory FAT, or change the comments of a file,
or edit any files on the disk, or do anything that would require writing
with the cable cut?  When a drive is write protected -- by software
-- you are not supposed to be writing anything to the drive.  But the
DOS itself may keep track of the last time the file was read or whatever,
and that involves writing to the disk (i.e. it overrides the software
protection mechanism...).  How could it do this if you cut the write line(s)?
Are you as quick as the computer is to be able to switch the lines back
on when the DOS feels like updating something?

I still think the only way to combat viruses is to check the source code
for them by a competent programmer, and then recompile the stuff.  Praying
all the time that the compiler is not infested as well....*ho hum* Will
we never be free of these things?!

Our Telecommunications Staff set up a lab of IBM PC portables, each with
a 20 Meg HardCard installed. They, in their usual brilliant manner,
have disabled the write head.
I cannot say exactly how they did this, but the people that did this
did not seem to be overly distraught at doing this.

This is probably something that differs between systems, but at least
on my Amiga, this is not at all true.

Very rarely is my CPU at 100% utilization.  After all, for every compile
I do, how many hours do I spend editing?  Editing, and things like that,
take up very little processor time.  I have TONS of wasted CPU cycles
lying around.

However, storage space is more of a problem.  I have only 512K of RAM,
and no hard disk.  Even if I had a hard disk, though, I still would
want to keep my virus checking data on a write-protectable media,
ie floppy.

It seems to me that a good solution would be to start up a low
priority process which will periodically go through my executables,
ensuring that their checksums haven't changed.  Since it is low priority,
it will not affect whatever else I am doing, no matter how much a
CPU hog it is.  If it was small (say, <10K) then I probably wouldn't
notice the memory loss.

Notice, however, that this would require a short signature for each file
(since the signatures will have to be in memory).  This shouldn't
affect its security, though, since each time it is run it can randomly
choose a checksum formula (ie, each time it is run it randomly picks
a CRC polynomial, checksums each file, and thereafter periodically
rechecks each file).

How about it?

About the teaching of virus-writing...

   I don't see why the 'assignment' has to be to write a malicious virus.
(and maybe it wasn't).  Perhaps instead of destroying data, it could just
display some little blurb about your disk being infected.  No doubt this
is very annoying, but it would save data from being destoyed.  The
author could then be contacted and the virus removed.  Concerning the
legality of this, perhaps each student could be made responsible for
his/her programs by signing a legal document, knowing that any loss of
data due to his/her virus is grounds for a lawsuit.  It may, however be
difficult to prove whose virus did the destroying, especially if the
virus 'committed suicide' and erased itself.  Another good idea would be
to have the students write a 'vaccine' also.  Not for their particular
virus, but a virus in general.  This way, they would learn something
more useful and may spend their spare time writing vaccines instead of
virus programs.

   Not having learned how to write a virus in school isn't going to stop
anyone who REALLY wants to write one.  Its kind of like those guys who
got all the necessary information to build a Hydrogen bomb.  (What if
THAT was taught in college?).  The information is out there, it just may
take a while longer to find it oneself.

   In my opinion, I think that this is unethical. My opinion comes as a
software developer, ie I write programs in order to eat. (But perhaps that's
neither here nor there.)
   Perhaps an analogy could get across my point of view. Suppose that some
professor of mechanical engineering were to decide that to truly understand
how a car works, his class should learn how to jimmy a car such that it
would have an accident. I would suggest that this is similar to such a
situation (by the way, I sincerely hope that no engineering courses teach
students how to DESTROY things!). In order to truly understand something,
one needn't know how to pervert it.

  This story about the prof who had his students write a computer virus is
most interesting.  I might be wrong, but it seems like this story might have
undergone some contortions as it passed through the network.  I find it hard
to believe a professor would have his/her students write a virus and then
infect innocent systems with it.  Perhaps the professor never actually had
intended the viruses be spread.  Maybe he had religated a certain computer
on which to test the results of his students' work.

  If the professor had specifically instructed his students not to actually
spread their virus programs, I would say he was not acting irresponsibly.
If the professor had not discussed the harm such virus infestations can do,
he or she was certainly remiss in his/her duties and responsibilities.  Of
course I like the basic idea of giving each student an assignment to write
a virus.  Then each student can be given other student's virus and assigned
the task of writing a cure.  This would be a great educational experience.

  Those who consider this professor to be irresponsible might be write if
the story goes as told.  I just wonder how well a person can develop a cure
for a virus without having a very good understanding of how they work.  One
can get no better understanding of how a virus would work than by actually
writing one and having others try and cure it.  Just think of all the progress
made by medical science.  Much research in medicine involves creating viruses
or rather growing them, to see how they grow and thrive.  The same is true
of imunizing against a software virus.  Of course, I would hope that software
scientists would take the same care and responsibility that their medical
counterparts do.

I would personally have to say that teaching someone how to write a
virus WITHOUT knowing whether he or she is a "model citizen" is
probably a bad idea.

It seems to me that such a procedure is like teaching chemistry students
how to synthesize hard-to-detect toxins or hallucinogens, or like teaching
undergraduate biology majors to play with recombinant DNA experiments with
the AIDS virus in a regular lab.

Many problems could occur. The accidental release of a virulent virus could
cause a very nasty "plague" before it was stopped. The deliberate release of
such is akin (at least in my opinion) to germ or chemical warfare. Such things
are not easy to target, and unforseen effects nearly always occur.  Finally,
the students present a danger to themselves through inadvertent exposure to
their own viruses.

Regarding the Engineering professor who taught virus writing:

As long as the professor was very explicit about the dangers of releasing the
virus, he was acting quite properly. His methods are pedagogically sound.
In order to cure a virus, it is NECESSARY to understand how they work.
The best way to understand how they work is to write one.
There are similar examples in other engineering fields. A Civil Engineer
might, for example, build a model bridge only to destroy it. Of course,
this is only a valid analogy if the lab where the virus was written was
isolated from other computers.

Re: Freedom of information and the virus "course".

I believe that the professor has the right to teach such a course.  The
professor is also responsible for damage done to others during conduct
of the course.  Of course, a little "social pressure" is the right of the
professor's colleagues.

Several participants have suggested ways to make a hard disk drive
unavailable to the operating system while testing a potentially
infected piece of software.

All of these suggestions presuppose that the virus plays by the rules:
that it opens files by calling the operating system's "open" routine, etc.

Since the drive is still electrically connected, however, you have no way
of preventing the virus from bypassing the operating system, controlling
the hard disk by directly accessing the command registers.

I.e., you really have to unplug the drive to be safe.  Of course, this
may void your warranty...
