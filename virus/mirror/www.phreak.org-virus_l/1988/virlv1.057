Re: J.D. Abolins comment about beggining another Dirty Dozen list:

I was also quite a fan of the list, and have lost track of Eric
Newhouse.  Apparently he has dropped out of sight??  I would be most
willing to help work on such a list.  I have been collecting some
"badware" which mostly fall into the category of pirated software,
hacked software, or a very few legitamate trojan horses.  No viruses,
though.  I agreee that a more comprehensive, and perhaps broader
scoped list is needed.  And something that carries some authority with
it(???).  The Dirty Dozen tended to be circulated mostly around BBSes,
and microcomputer users, rather than in the corporate environment.

If anyone else, is interested in making efforts in this direction,
speak up, and perhaps we can put something together.

Subject:      Boot Sectors on IBM disks (PC)

   Regarding BOOT sectors and some of Homer Smith's questions:

   As Joe Simpson points out, all disks have a boot sector on them.
It is important to understand the functionality of the boot sector.
When you power up the computer, it immediately loads some instructions
from ROM and runs them.  Among other things (like doing some
self-checks), these instructions for example tell the computer to try
to read disk drive A: (depending upon your configuration of course).
If there is a formatted diskette present, then it loads the boot
sector and does *whatever* the boot sector tells it to, even if it's a
non-system diskette.

   All MSDOS-formatted disks have a boot sector containing
instructions, regardless of whether or not the diskette was formatted
with the system option (doubters, go look at the boot sector on a
non-bootable disk).  In fact, the boot sectors of system and
non-system diskettes are identical.  The difference between system and
non-system disks *for* *the* *IBM* *PC* is not in the boot sector, but
in the presence or absence of system files on the disk (that's easy to
check: just format a disk *without* the system option and then copy
the system files onto the disk and see if it works [Assuming that
you're running MSDOS, these files are ibmbio.com, ibmdos.com, and
command.com, the first two of which are *hidden*.].  It does.  Either
that or examine the boot sector bit for bit).  All the system option
does is tell the machine to copy these three files after formatting.
The directory, FAT, and sectoring get setup during the format (with
erasure of anything that may have been on the disk before formatting).

   The instructions found on the boot sector normally tell the
computer to go find certain system files on the disk, load them into
memory, and run them.  This is how DOS gets going.  If the system
files are not found, then an error message like "Non-system disk or
disk error Replace and strike any key when ready" is displayed and the
computer waits for you to respond.

   It should be clear that it would be very easy for a virus to put
instructions in the boot sector (regardless of what option was used
when formatting the disk) telling the computer (when booted) to go
find some virus file on the disk, load it into memory, and then go
back and excute the real boot sector (which was moved by the virus to
some other part of the disk), leaving many users none the wiser.  Even
if it's a non-system diskette, the computer doesn't know that (upon
booting) until it loads the boot sector and executes it and doesn't
find any system files (but if there is a boot virus present, the virus
gets run first before the "Non-system disk ..." message gets
displayed).  This is true regardless of whether the disk even has any
files on it.  A large virus may not be able to fit entirely in the
boot sector, but that's no problem; it can store instructions in good
sectors which it labels as "bad" (so that DOS won't overwrite them),
or in hidden files (which could be discovered).

   It should also be pointed out (as I'm sure it has been many times
on this list) that utilities such as DIR or FORMAT are programs and
can be infected with a virus (so just doing a DIR can infect any disks
you happen to have in any of your drives at that time).

   It would be a good idea to think about all this in the context of
real, known viruses, so I'm hoping somebody will be able to put
together a compilation of discriptions of all known viruses, variants,
and their characteristics.

Something about write tabs: We have a genuine 6MHz IBM PC AT which I
have discovered can write to the disk *if* the write tab is
transparent.

Subject: Leisure Suit Larry 'virus' (PC)

     There was some discussion of this on the network where I work.
The consensus was that it is a Trojan, not a virus; it gets loaded
into memory when LSL is run, then remains and destroys things, but
does not copy itself to other programs, not even other copies of LSL.

     No one has cross posted it yet, but RISKS 7.96 has an article
about virus infection in the USSR.  They have, of course, developed
the ultimate anti virus program, the details of which remain a state
secret ...

     Also, 7.97 reports on an article which implies that virus
infections are one-in-a-million.

I did my homework before I wrote my opinion.  I already knew about the
documented BIOS interrupt limitations.  There are undocumented BIOS
calls, and there are non-BIOS hardware calls.

When the PC was a baby, one or two software vendors (obscure ones) had
a copy protection scheme that involved writing something to their own
diskettes, whether write protected or not, on the user's machine.
Sorry, I don't remember the package.  Somebody noticed this and asked
IBM about it.  Of course it wasn't documented.  It wasn't DOS or BIOS.
The answer was no, it couldn't be done, but the fact remained that it
was being done, and eventually, informally, not for attribution, quietly,
those who were asking got word that it could be done, in software.
The technique was not part of the answer.  I have no proof.  It may
have been an undocumented feature of the early diskette drives, long
ago de-featured.  I don't know.  But the facts of the case seemed clear
at the time, and that was the basis for my position that write protect
tabs are not certain protection on a PC.

Nope, it's mechanical in IBM PC's.
Yes, thanks guys.  I do appreciate the research.  I am almost but not
quite convinced that the unattributable IBM source I mentioned above
was wrong, or that newer drives are indeed absolutely hardware protected.
The only remaining loopholes are in Len Levine's not-yet-conclusive
research (see his V1 #54 contribution) that disk controller ROM is loaded
into RAM at boot time.  You could tweak it as you liked, then!  You could
prevent it from being reloaded, you could change the logic states.
In short, you could lie to the disk controller about the write protect
status.  It is possible that the hardware protection is absolute, but
I agree with Len Levine that the question is still open, and I for one
would never trust an IBM Tech Ref manual to tell the whole story.  I've
been living with those suckers for about seven years, and they get less
informative every year.

Subject: Amiga virus could survive warm boot

After reading the discussions regarding viruses that can support a
warm boot, I remembered some material I had seen a few months ago
regarding Amiga microcomputer viruses that did the same thing.  Here
are some of the messages from back then that were gleaned from
compuserve and Amiga BBSes.


 Article 10437 of 10516, Fri 11:32.
 Subject: Amiga VIRUS
 From: bill@cbmvax.UUCP (Bill Koester CATS)
 Date: 13 Nov 87 19:32:05 GMT

         THE AMIGA VIRUS - Bill Koester (CATS)

When I first got a copy of the Amiga VIRUS I was interested to
see how such a program worked. I dissassembled the code to a disk
file and hand commented it. This article will try to pass on some
of the things I have learned through my efforts.

                  1) Definition.
                  2) Dangers.
                  3) Mechanics
                  4) Prevention

1. - Definition.
- ----------------

The Amiga VIRUS is simply a modification of the boot block of an
existing DOS boot disk. Any disk that can be used to boot the
Amiga (ie workbench) has a reserved area called the boot block.
On an Amiga floppy the bootblock consists of the first two
sectors on the disk. Each sector is 512 bytes long so the boot
block contains 1024 bytes. When KickStart is bringing up the
system the disk in drive 0 is checked to see if it is a valid DOS
boot disk. If it is, the first two sectors on the disk are loaded
into memory and executed. The boot block normally contains a
small bit of code that loads and initializes the DOS. If not for
this BOOT CODE you would never see the initial CLI. The normal
BOOT CODE is very small and does nothing but call the DOS
initialization. Therefore, on a normal DOS boot disk there is
plenty of room left unused in the BOOT BLOCK.

The VIRUS is a replacement for the normal DOS BOOT CODE. In
addition to performing the normal DOS startup the VIRUS contains
code for displaying the VIRUS message and infecting other disks.
Once the machine is booted from an infected disk the VIRUS
remains in memory even after a warm start. Once the VIRUS is
memory resident the warm start routine is affected, instead of
going through the normal startup the VIRUS checks the boot disk
in drive 0 for itself. If the VIRUS in memory sees that the boot
block is not infected it copies itself into the boot block
overwriting any code that was there before. It is in this manner
that the VIRUS propagates from one disk to another. After a
certain number of disks have been infected the VIRUS will print a
message telling you that Something wonderful has happened.


2. - Dangers.
- -------------

When the VIRUS infects a disk the existing boot block is
overwritten. Since some commercial software packages and
especially games store special information in the boot block the
VIRUS could damage these disks. When the boot block is written
with the VIRUS, any special information is lost forever. If it
was your only copy of the game then you are out of luck and
probably quite angry!!

3. - Mechanics.
- ---------------

Here is a more detailed description of what the virus does. This
is intended to be used for learning and understanding ONLY!! It
is not the authors intention that this description be used to
create any new strains of the VIRUS. What may have once been an
innocent hack has turned into a destructive pain in the #$@ for
many people. Lets not make it any worse!!

   a.)   Infiltration.

This is the first stage of viral infection. The machine is
brought up normally by reading the boot block into memory. When
control is transferred to the boot block code, the virus code
immediately copies the entire boot block to $7EC00, it then JSR's
to the copied code to wedge into the CoolCapture vector. Once
wedged in, control returns to the loaded boot block which
performs the normal dos i the system.

   b.)   Hiding Out.

At this point the syem CoolCapture vector has been replaced and
points to code thin the virus. When control is routed through
the CoolCapte vector the virus first checks for the left mouse
button,  it is down the virus clears the CoolCapture wedge and
retuns to the system. If the left mouse button is not pressed
t virus replaces the DoIO code with its own version of DoIO a
returns to the system.

   c.)   Spreading.

The code far has been concerned only with making sure that at
any gin time the DoIO vector points to virus code. This is
where e real action takes place. On every call to DoIO the
virus hecks the io_Length field of the IOB if this length is
equato 1024 bytes then it could possibly be a request to read
t in the strap code and this is a boot
block read request. Inot installed. If we
are reading the boot block we JSR to te old DoIO code to read
the boot block and then control retrns to us. After reading, the
checksum for the virus boot bk is
already infected so just return. If they are not equala counter
is incremented and the copy of the virus at $7EC0is written to
the boot block on the disk. If the counter ANed with $F is equal
to 0 then a rastport and bitmap are conected by a VIRUS >
< Another masterpiece of the Mega-MightySCA >

4. - Prevention.
- ----------------

How do you otect yourself from the virus?

1) Never warm start the machine, always power down first. (works
but not to practical!)

2) Always hold down the left mouse button when rebooting. (Also
works, but only because the VIRUS code checks for
                                                 3) Obtain a copy of VCheck1.1 d
into the public domain. VCheck.1 was posted to usnet and will
also be posted to BIX. ( Jut like the real thing the best course
of action is educatio and prevention!)

Sb: #WARNING! Virus loose!
Fm: Larry Phillre are a variety of programs
that are variously known as Trjan Horses, Bombs, and Viruses. While Bombs
are generally destructive (as evidenced by their name), and Trojan Horses
re either destructive or for the purpose of theft of data, Viruses have
been known to be benign or malignant both. A Vive it may or may not be, it will 
                                                                               n
infected disk. All works normally, with no sign tt the machine with the CTRL-Amn
uninfeted disk, the virus is transferred to the boot disk, and it oo
becomes a "carrier", ready to pass it on, and so on.

The presence of the virus can be detected by looking at block 1 on a disk.
Normally, this will have random data or a pattern of data in it, but you
will be able to see the virus tor 1). If the virus is present, run INSTALL on tL
will rewrite sectors 0 and 1, killing the virus. Then's power. If you have bootn
infected disk, and havect the disk.

There have been a couple of reports of a mewas trashed by the virus. The messag:
"Something wondesame message that appears in block 1 of an infected disk.

Watch for it... stomp it out.

Lart, but I thought that re-booting the
system was supposed tirus be
transmited?

     Also, should someone without the ability to look at a disk in the way
you suggested run across this message will a cold reboot solve the problem
(so gain)? Will initalizing an
"infected" disk (after a cold boot) remove the infection? (along with anything
else on the u think that this message is important enough
to go at the head of the forum-so that you see it when you enter the foruot onlo
aTRL-Amiga-Amiga). The virus
itself is contained in the "boohen you reboot with an
uninfected disk, the virus writes it infecting it as well.

  A cold reboot (power off, power on) will indeed remove it from the
memory. The problem is, is infected before you would think to go through
this procedure.

  As for looking at the disk to determine if the virus is there, the
program to use is "Sectorama", which is in DL 9 as SEC.ARC. Perhaps
someone will come up with a program that will detect and kill the virus,
giving you a warning at the same time.

  I do think it's important, and we will probably put it into one of the
Data Libraries and mention it in the short bulletin which everyone will
see upon entry to the forum.

Regards, Larry.

Subject:      Brain surviving warm boot (PC)

I first brought up this issue about the Brain Virus being able to
sustain itself even after a warm boot and it being able to write to a
write protected disk. These were my findings and I posted them to the
list. As far as I am concerned they were accurate.

To do away with all the flames, I have requsitioned another dual
floppy machine (the same as the one used in my first test). I will
repeat the tests that yielded such controversial results and will
post the results back to the list.  Until then please hold on to your
flames.

To Homer re FORMAT...regarding your hard disk low level format, what
kind of computer did you say you have?  Did you say your computer
supported a hard- disk?

The DOS FORMAT command does NOT destroy data on the disk.  It wipes
out the FAT, which is kind of like the card catalog and releases all
locations so that they can be written over.  If you use NORTON
utilities or something similar, you will see on a disk that had data
on it and was FORMATted, that the items in the root directory can be
listed, only with '?' in place of the first character.  These items
can then be restored, since the directory listing also gives the 1st
sector or cluster location.  If the files are contiguous they can be
saved.  All this means that a virus residing in the data area will not
be erased, but it isn't safe either, unless other factors are
implemented.  I think that during the FORMAT, DOS will skip over areas
deemed bad during the low level format.  Presumably a virus could lock
out these sectors so that they could be used for the virus's purposes.
