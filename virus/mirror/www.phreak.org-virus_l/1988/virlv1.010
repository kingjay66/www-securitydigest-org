There are several crypto packages on the market that implement the DES
algorithm on PCs.  A couple that come to mind are "Codename: Password"
and I believe Sidekick (I may have the name wrong).  I have been
thinking (and worrying) lately about how a virus could exploit these
packages to make itself very painful to remove.  Here is how it would
work:

The virus would go along, propagating itself in the normal way, but it
would recognize when it had attached itself to the crypto program.  It
would then modify the encryption tables slightly in a reversable way,
so that encrypted things could be decrypted (in DES, the IP and IP-1
tables would probably be the most appropriate targets).  It would then
have to know if files were encrypted the old (good) or new (bad) way.
If there is some kind of a crypto header in the file, it could stuff
the information in an unused bit; or maybe it could do it based on
date.

Anyway, if you decrypted an old file, it would work fine, and if you
encrypted a new file then decrypted it, it would work fine.  But
suppose you discovered the virus, and re-installed all your software
to ensure that your system was clean.  Suddenly all the files you had
encrypted after the initial attack of the virus would be garbage.  If
you put back the virus-laden version of the crypto package, you could
get at your files, but the virus could continue to spread.

Of course, on a system where gurus were available, it would be
possible to compare the infected and uninfected versions of the crypto
package, disassemble the changes, and come up with the necessary zaps
to make a crypto package that would decrypt the damaged files without
propagating the virus.  A system with only non-technoid users would
not have this option.  (And if the virus chose its modifications to
the crypto tables randomly when it first infected the crypto package,
it would make it hard for a central support organization, or the
VIRUS-L forum, or whatever, to provide all the crypto users with
patches to decrypt the damaged files.)

I must admit that most of my experience with computers and DES has
been on large mainframes (IBM MVS and VM), so I may have overlooked
something that would make this attack less of a concern, but if I
have, I don't see it.  (I guess that's what overlooking's all about.)

Subject: Viruses in VM/CMS

This discussion started in ETHICS-L, but I think it should be
continued in VIRUS-L.

Somebody mentioned the Christmas Card 'virus'. I would just like to
mention the really BIG security hole in VM/CMS. The CCv did not use
this hole, but if it had it would have been MUCH worse.

VM/CMS has a 'feature' that when a program returns to toplevel
anything left on the program stack will be parsed as commands. Pretty
useful sometimes but it makes possible some hideous bugs and security
holes.

RECEIVE EXEC has such a bug, if a spoolfile is of incorrect format
RECEIVE may leave part of it on the stack upon exit. SENDFILE or NOTE
will never make such a file of course, but more low level commands
make it possible. I don't know any more details (and wouldn't publish
them anyway), but the cure is simple:

Insert a MAKEBUF in the start and a DROFBUF in the end(s) of RECEIVE.
(Be careful though not to change the effekt of the STack option.)
Everybody should use M/D in their programs as it makes them infinitely
more robust.

PS: DISCARD uses RECEIVE but I think (and hope!) that it is more
robust.

Hobbit, who moderates that list, has been busy working on the big move
from the vax AIM.RUTGERS.EDU to a Sun PYRITE.RUTGERS.EDU, which is now
aliased to AIM.  He says that the list will re-awaken when he gets
done with the move.  Mark

Not all evil hackers are meet for hiring.  Morris at any rate would
not be a prime candidate, despite his successful attack, because the
attack mode was not the result of his own research, nor was his code
particularly excellent.  Apparently the debug hole was revealed to him
by other sources, so there is no evidence he is a wonderfully clever
hacker.  Burleson also is not a candidate; he simply planted an evil
program in his former employer's computers.  Once again, no evidence
of extreme cleverness.

Evil hackers can be hired by major companies if the following two
constraints are met: the hacker has, through his own initiative and
intellect, explored security holes or bugs that were not widely known;
the hacker himself has not become famous.

The first constraint simply means that there is no practical reason
for a company to take any risk with someone who ain't that smart.

The second constraint is very important, and is the reason why you
won't see publicly known hackers getting great security jobs.
Ignoring this constraint would promote the image that anyone could get
a great job by being an evil hacker.  There is apparently enough
incentive for this kind of behavior already; if employers increased
the incentive, they would merely be complicating their own hiring
process.

One other reason why Morris hasn't got a chance at getting hired is
that the media has portrayed him essentially as a wimp.  Everything
they've described about him implies that he's a man with no balls.
Real evil hackers have got to have balls.

I wish people would stop trying to inject morality and ethics into the
question of whether hackers should get good jobs.  The question is not
'should'; it is 'will', and morality has nothing to do with it; it's
called economics.  Part of being a successful business is knowing when
to take a risk.  Ethics are only an issue when the public finds out
about it.

     With all due respect, Mr Doug Hunt could not be more wrong.

     Those of us who have some small access to memories of our past
lives have learned that people do to others what was done to them.

     People who fervently believe that criminals should be executed
were criminals themselves in a past life and were executed.  In this
life they are self righteous upstanding citizens who have 'never lived
before and would NEVER have done such a thing.'

     When we incarcerate people or ruin their lives for 'crimes
against the empire' we punish them and satisfy our hurts by doing so,
and maybe we scare those who would follow in their footsteps, but we
always fail to extract the amends from such people that they owe us
and must give in order to be rehabilitated.

     I would be proud to have Mr. Morris as a security expert for our
nation as long as the proper amends is allowed to take its course.
Amends does not mean I break your toy because you broke my toy.  Two
broken toys is two broken toys.  Then we BOTH owe amends to society.

     The road to hell is NOT paved with good intentions.  That is just
Christian/Creationist double junk and they know it.  THESE people who
rant and rave in such a way are a FAR GREATER danger to our national
security than Mr. Morris.  They are just jealous as hell that Mr.
Morris is brighter than they are and could undermine their computer
defenses while scribbling on napkins over morning coffee.

     God does not approve of a society that produces criminals or can
not handle them once they produce themselves.  God can handle them.
Why can not we?  Have we bought the line that some people SHOULD not
be handled?  Or that some people CAN NOT be handled?  Or that God does
not WANT us to handle them?  Rubbish.  Especially for someone like
Morris who is clearly very far from the pit.  Probably farther from
the pit than the American Government themselves in their dealings with
the world at large.

     Why punish when you can salvage?  Surely Morris is salvagable.
(Don't tell me I am a bleeding heart Liberal.  I voted for Bush.  If
you want to worry about viruses, worry about HIM.)

     Morris needs to make amends.  Not by having his toys broken
because he broke ours, but by what ever means necessary so that we can
feel resolved about the matter and in some sense be glad it happened
with no lingering resentments or bitterness, and most importantly in a
way that society can feel safe trusting Morris with the run of the
land again.  [Ed. Any (hypothetical, of course) suggestions?]

     Placing Morris in jail or ruining his career may satisfy the
stone cold hearts of some but it wont make a better land for any of
us.  The Eternal NAME is not SHAME.

Subject:      Viruses in Military Computers

I was wondering. There might be a possiblity there is a bug in one of
the fire-control programs that might just start working when a real
threat appears. Is it possible and can be done against it?

[Ed. I would think that's what they do drills for.  In a (properly
planned) drill, the computer (or other controlling agent) would truly
believe that it is the real thing.  Comments?]
