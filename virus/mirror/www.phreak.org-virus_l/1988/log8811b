I'm not sure about the Computer Virus Association, but John McAfee
is a sysop of the National BBS Society Homebase BBS.  He also works
for Interpath Corporation which sells anti-virus software.  The bbs
number (408-988-4004) was mentioned in an early article posted to
virus-l entitled Anti-Virus Measures.  I called when we were hit with
brain here, and Mr. McAfee was gracious enough to break in to chat
while I was leaving a note to the sysop about our problem at log off.

There also seems to be another organization involved, the Interactive
Communications Users Guild which I think is a SIG of the National
BBS Society.

He has since been most helpful in dealing with our infection.

    Can we get a little organized around here?  I have just received two message
    containing the same article from RISK.  This is the second or third time thi
    happenned.  We should just designate one person to forward all messages from
    RISK concerning the virus.

I must appologize, my message APPEARED later than the rest (at least it
did to me), but I sent it on wednesday or so.  I guess the delay in
getting messages from here in Canada down to Bethlehem (Lehigh really)
is greater than from other areas.  As far as Risks submissions go, I (as
many of you are I am sure) am a subscriber to the Risks Digest List, and
I would be willing to take on the responsibility of posting anything
from Risks that I feel in some way relates to Virus-L.

    What's all this about virii?  "Virii" is the plural of "virius."  If you
    mean more than one virus, try "viruses" or, if you must, "viri."

    On the other hand, we could let

                  virii = 2 viruses
                 viriii = 3 viruses
                  viriv = 4 viruses
                   virv = 5 viruses
                          etc.


(Please understand that I don't mean this to be a flame)

The only proper plural form of the word virus is viruses.  Virus is NOT
a Latin word, and hence should not be declined like one.  (In fact viri
can be any one of the Genetive singular, Nominative plural, or Vocative
plural forms of the noun man (vir)).

Just so that we can avoid a major bagging session as has occurred on
USENET in teh past.  :-)

---------------------
At Cornell things were much the same as elsewhere.  We were hit by the
worm about 1:30 AM Thursday.  From what I have heard, we were not the
first ones affected, but given the cleverness of the scheme of attack
that should be no surprise.  The author could have launched the worm
manually into one or more distant systems from here, and it would seem
to have started there.  Overall, about 100 Cornell computers were affected,
and some are still cut off from our campus backbone net pending thorough
cleanup.  At that hour of the morning, the symptoms of periodic crashes
and slowdowns went mostly unnoticed.  Next morning, we read the NetNews
that many sites were under attack, discovered we were too, and immediately
disconnected Cornell from Internet and also disconnected all our subnets
from one another to isolate the worm from any vulnerable systems not yet
invaded.
     The Supercomputing Facility was back on line in about 30 minutes,
once we were sure it would not be affected, and other subnets came back
one by one during the day.  Our EE Dept. and the Theory Center (which is
the organization behind supercomputing here) got hold of the fixes for
VAXen from outside sources (UCB and MIT, right?), while the Laboratory for
Solid State Physics developed program fixes for Sun workstations, and the
Laboratory for Plasma Studies developed a local repair procedure for Ultrix.By T
with one another.
     As for the perpetrator, he seems to be a modern Sorcerer's Apprentice.
It seems he intended no real harm, and I have heard more than one person
say he did us (not Cornell, but us computer users) a big favor by showing
so clearly that even a manager could understand it, that we are far from
protected against such encroachments.  We know no more about his motives
than we have read in the newspapers.  The NY Times and Washington Post
have had lengthy articles, and seem to have had access to sources not
yet available to Cornell or the Computer Science Department.  (I.e.,
anonymous phone calls from his friends.)  He is a nice person, we know
from acquaintances: sings in the choir, for example.  I suppose the
Cornell administration cannot possibly let him get away without some
kind of official punishment, but I for one don't think he deserves a
very severe one.  The cost of restitution alone would be enormous if
he had to reimburse people for some fraction of the time they have spent
cleaning up, not to mention discussing the matter!

Following is an article re-printed from the Rochester Democrat & Chronicle
State/Nation Section A pp.23-24, Sunday, November 6, 1988.

SINGLE PROGRAM ERROR MADE 'VIRUS' MULTIPLY
Big computer jam horrified creator

The New York Times and The Associated Press

Robert Tappan Morris Jr. spent many weeks painstakingly creating the computer
"virus" that beleaguered many of the nation's computer networks Wednesday
night and Thursday.

By all accounts the 23-year-old computer science student intended no harm.

But in the end, working with great intensity and little sleep, he made a single
programming error that ultimately jammed more than 6,000 computers,
including some at the University of Rochester.

That mistake also brought Morris' life crashing down around him, three friends
have told The New York Times.

He quickly recognized that things had gone terribly wrong and arranged for a
friend to send out instructions on eradicating the virus to the computers
plagued by it.

But the instructions were electronically posted in a bulletin board where few
would see them.

Then he turned himself in to his father, Robert T. Morris Sr., one of the
government's top experts on computer security.

The first-year Cornell University graduate student was not available for
comment yesterday.

But those who knew him as a student at Harvard, where he earned his
undergraduate degree in computer science, paint a picture of a remarkably
bright but private person.

Professors at Harvard and Cornell said Morris was not malicious, stressing
that the program could have been easily modified to destroy data.

Morris' father, Robert Morris Sr., 56, worked for many years at AT&T's
Bell Labs in New Jersey.  He helped develop the Unix operating system,
which was the target of his son's virus.

Two years ago, the elder Morris left Bell Labs and went to work as the chief
scientist for the National Computer Security Center, the division of the
National Security Agency that focuses on computer security.

A student who is friends with Morris Jr. said that when he discovered
the flaw that would let him secretly enter Unix computers connected
to the Arpanet, a Department of Defense computer research network,
he was so excited that he literally jumped on the friend's desk.

This friend and others said Morris' original vision was to spread a tiny
program widely throughout the United States and internationally and have it
secretly take up residence in the memory of each computer it entered.

The program was supposed to slowly propagate, always hiding in the back-
ground to escape detection.

However, because the young computer expert chose a single incorrect
number, and that number bore directly on the rate of replication, the
virus instead sped madly out of control creating dozens or even hundreds
of copies on each machine it entered rather than the one copy originally
planned.

Morris learned of his replication error through a monitoring mechanism he
had built into his program.

In trying to alert people to the virus after discovering his error,
Morris had a friend post detailed instructions on how to disable it,
but the electronic "bulletin board" he chose for posting was an obscure one,
the friend who posted it said.

Yesterday at Harvard, from which Morris graduated last spring, his professors
were shocked that he undertook the project.

"What surprises me about this is that it cuts across the grain of Robert's
personality," said Mark Friedell, the assistant professor of computer
science who was the young student's advisor for three years.  "He probably
got scared and froze; he could have stopped it."

University officials also were unable to contact him, Lynn said.

His parents obtained an attorney and was planning to meet shortly with U.S.
Justice Department officials.

Cornell officials said they began examining Morris' computer files
Friday night after The Times identified him.

Morris had passwords in his files "for some computers at Cornell and
Stanford to which he is not entitled," although those could have been
placed there by someone else, Lynn said.

A computer file dated Oct. 26 found in Cornell's system yesterday is
the earliest indication that Morris may have been writing the program
that spawned the virus, Lynn said.

The creator "apparently found a gaping hole in the system that I'm
amazed no one exploited before," Cornell instructor Dexter Kozen said.
While the loophole in the system was not evident before the virus was
unleashed, "in retrospect, it's really quite obvious."

Morris' father, Robert Morris Sr., a top government computer security
expert, refused to comment on whether his son concocted the virus.

But he said the episode may prevent a serious security breach in the future.

"It's going to be remembered for a long time," said the elder Morris,
chief scientist at the National Computer Security Center in Bethesda, Md.
"And I think we'll see a substantial improvement in the way computers and
networks are administered."

Morris also said he felt ambivalent about the incident.

"I'm close to this in two ways," he said.  "I myself am a computer
user but I'm also a father.  That makes it difficult to separate the
two roles, although, of course, they have to be separated."

Morris said he is convinced the virus was unleashed accidentally.

"It seems there was no malicious intent involved.  No harm was intended
or actually done in the host computers, other than overload, and that
appears to be a design error," he said.

Apart from the PC virii, UK computers seem to be more secure to VIRII
due to good housekeeping and minor technical difficulties

However this may also be due to the fact that British kids don't have
the same intelligence as American ones.

In-Reply-To:  Message of Mon, 7 Nov 88 16:07:53 PST from <SAM@POMONA>

In reply to Sam Cropsey's questions about nVIR:  the strains of nVIR
which we've run into here have only infected the System, Finder and
application files on an infected Mac, no DA's in the sense that using
Font/DA Mover would spread the infection.  Someone correct me if I'm
wrong.  As far as getting rid of nVIR, it's a good deal easier to use
the Init known as KillVirus (available in various electronic places,
including MACSERVE on BITNET).  This Init installs a tiny nVIR
resource with ID=10 in the System ( this resource is NOT infectious).
The author of nVIR included a back door in the program:  if nVIR
"sees" the nVIR ID=10 resource, it cleanly removes itself from the
infected system or application.  This should be easier than the
explicit coding, etc. suggested in the MacTutor article, though not
as much fun!  ;-)   Sean

I am not a Mac user, so please forgive any lapses in terminology.

A local Mac user tells me that he recently discovered a new application
on his disk, called "worms".  Running it pops up a little display with
worms crawling around on it.

He doesn't know where it came from.  He claims that he does not share
disks with people.  He is connected to an AppleTalk network, which is
connected to a FastPath.

Now, in light of the Internet Worm, he's feeling suspicious about this
Macintosh Worm of unknown origin.  Is it possible that it's a virus?
Has anyone else seen this application?

Viruses is the correct spelling. And viricide or virucide is the correct word
for antidotes for viruses.

VIRICIDE - an agent that destroys or inactivates viruses
VIRUCIDE - spelling variation of viricide.

Big deal, so we saw several copies of the same message during an event
that was of significance to us.  I would rather see the several copies
than have to wait for the "official" copy that would be sent by one
person who might be busy or unavailable.  If we need organization let
us join a political party, I prefer an excess of information.

Of course he should pay the cost of fixing up the mess.  If a black
kid in the ghetto had painted up some walls, as a means of self
expression and to show us all how vulnerable we are, then he would be
expected to make restitution, why not this child of education and
culture?

If he is an adult then he is responsible for what he does, if not then
we should put him somewhere where he cannot harm himself or others.

Actually, Your supposition that if they can find who started the virus,
it is a frame job, has got to be incorrect.   Very few people have enough
control over their ego to keep something that hits the national news a

Subject:      Internet Worm


I've read the various accounts of the internet worm and there
is one thing I am having trouble with.

The worm took advantage of the fact that when sendmail is
put in debug mode a remote shell command could be executed
through it.  I thought that even if sendmail is compiled
with the debug option on, this was only possible if
the local machine or user on the local machine knew
the remote machines wizard password.

Although I haven't analyzed the complete source, a cursory
look at the source I have reveals the following lines:
(Note: this is an older version, but I presume it's
still set up in the same way.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
char    *WizWord;            /* the wizard word to compare against*/

if (strcmp(WizWord, crypt(p, seed)) == 0) {
    IsWiz = TRUE;
    message("200", "Please pass, oh mighty wizard");
        }
else
    message("500", "You are no wizard!");
----------------------------------------------------------------------

As part of the sendmail configuration file (sendmail.cf), typically
you see the following line which is the encrypted password.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
# wizard's password
OW*
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Since no encryption yield's "*", there should be nothing to worry
about in this case.  I have seen many config files that omit this or
fail to set it.  That could be a problem.

According to all accounts though, sendmail in debug mode was
letting anyone send a remote shell command.  So was there a problem
in the source, or was the problem lacking to set a wizard password
when debugging was enabled?

Hi Gang,
   I must admit that I did not consult the Latin dictinary in my office
before writing that last message.  As David Chess astutely reminded me,
the word virus is in fact Latin.  It can mean either a slimy liquid or
poison (especially the poison that comes from snakes).  Read into these
definitions what you may.

Subject:      ARPANET accountability


  The article that went through here last night covering the discovery and
exposure of the creator of the ARPANET virus seemed to gloss over, or simply
miss, the fact that (according to its own text) this program was not something
that turned into a virus and went out on its own at all.

  The article stated that the programmer's "original vision was to spread a
tiny program widely... and have it take up residence in the memory of each
computer it encountered" and was supposed to "slowly propogate, always hiding
in the background to escape detection".  That sure sounds like a virus to me.

  What this student seemed to be so appalled at was that his program mutated
on him (due to an apparent programming error) and changed from a virus to a
"bacterium" (to use the term that's been being used around here) and was thus
easily seen, but not until it had begun overloading computers nationwide.  It
seems that, as it was so aptly put, he was playing with fire and got burned.

  However, on the question of whether to prosecute this person, the article
put its head in the sand.  The question is not of a program that, by a simple
compiler error, went berzerk and became a virus by sheer chance.  This is an
exposure of what was intended to be a virus in the first place, but was
rendered VISIBLE by that programming error. We should cousider ourselves
fortunate that this error was made at all, and that no damage occurred (so far)
to databases and stored files.  Would we prefer that a virus be created which
would take advantage of this same (gaping) hole and use it to (for instance)
clog networks by sending all of the files it can reach out the nearest link?
Or worse yet, to a specific destination computer, either for plagiaristic
use or simple theft of information?

   I say prosecute.  Any others?

You knew it had to happen. With software viruses making headlines
everywhere, scads of companies have come up with antivirus programs
Now there are so many that they're forming a trade group.

The computer virus industry association (CVIA) has 10 members, all of
whom sell products desgined to wipe out viruses. They said joining the
groups lends their products extra credibility, because members'
products have to pass a suite of tests to prove they work.

That's an importatnt edge in market whose prodycts often get as much
respect as wiehgt-loss pills and baldness cures---and often are about
as effective. ``It's an environment that's conductive to misinformation
and farud,'' said John McAfee, president of CVIA.

PC WEEK, Aug. 15, 1988 (letters)

To the Editor:

I'd like to comment on the Aug. 1 Monitor report entitled ``Virus
association'' about the CVIA [Computer Virus Industry Association].

John McAfee, the self-appointed president of the group, sent out a press
release announcing the organization of the association. The release
claimed that CVIa members have 90 precent of the anti-virus software
market.

We at WordldWide Data [manufacturer of vaccine 2.0/2.1] decided that
to see if CVIA could back up its claims with some solid facts. When I
spoke to Mr. McAfee he could not substantiate his 90 percent market
claim, nor the credibility of CVIA's members.

In fact Mr. McAfee promised to send out a second release to recant these
claims by CVIA. Interestingly enough, your article quotes Mr. McAfee
as describing the anti-viral marketplace as being ```...conductive to
misinformation and fraud.''

This makes us wonder if the CVIA might be a case of having the foxes
guard the chicken coop!

While we like the idea of ``watchdog groups'' in general, we're not quite
sure what CVIA is up to.

As far as market share and product effectiveness are concerned, we think
the good old methods suffice: namely, product reviews in the computer
press and user references. We proudly stand behind ours.

As far as watchdog groupd and associations are concerned, there are
plenty of good ones around to keep anyone on their toes, particularly
the Computer Security Institute and the NYPC Users Group (Jon David of
the Security SIG is very active on the virus-protection issue), as well
as other organizations of which we are members.

VIRUS INDUSTRY LEADER ASSAILED

New York---An association set up to coordinate the activities of
antiviral software makers is coming under fire because the intentions of
its self-appointed chairman are being questioned.

John McAfee, who established the Computer Virus Inductry Association
(CVIA), heads another organization which has created the tests against
which CVIA members' antiviral software are measured. One of the antiviral
software packages tested is from McAfee's own company, and it mastered
every viral test.

In addition, McAfee has refused to submit his antiviral software to testing
anywhere else, except at three universities he has chosen, none of
which has reputation for expertise in viruses.

He has also been accused of using questionable techniques within the CVIA,
using unscrupulous methods to attract members, and has been charged
with promoting too much hype within the virus community.

``I would not call it a scam, but it sure as hell is one of the most
unethical things I've withnessed,'' said Ross greenberg, an independent
consoltant here.

McAfee established the CVIA, based in Santa Clara, Calif., to
standartize marketing and sales terminology as well as to educate
computer users about the issues surrounding viruses, he said. Ten
companies that merket and develop antiviral software, including
McAfee's InterPath Corp., have joined CVIA.

In addition to being in charge of CVIA and Interpath, McAfee has also
been running the National Bulletin Board Society (NBBS), where viruses
are collected, studied and simulated to create and test antiviral software.
The test of CVIA members' antoviral software was developed by NBBS using
simulated viruses.

It came as no surprise, then, when McAfee announced that his antoviral
software tested successfully against all 38 strains of simulated viruses
from the NBBS, according to Raymond Glath, president of RG Software Systems
Inc, Willow Grove, Ps. Glath said InterPath and NBBS have the same
address in Santa Clara, which was never made obvious to software
consumers.

``There seems to be a conflict of interest. They (InterPath) have a
virus simulator, as well as antivirus software,'' said Kenneth van
Wyk, user consultant, Lehigh University computing center, Bethlehem, Pa.
``It can be tailored so their program comes out smelling like daisies.
it is a valid conclusion---it ought to be developed by an independent source.''

...............
Many professionals in the virus field said an organization composed of
antiviral software manufactueres should not be setting the standards
of the virus community. Michael S. Riemer, FoundationWare's vice
president of marketing, Cleveland, said, ''If you want to have a non-biased
organization disseminating information on viruses, it should not
necessarily be run by the people creating security products.''

Ron Benvenosti, product manager as WorldWide Data Corp., New York, said
``It might be that the fox is guarding the chicken coop. We don't
believe in vendors starting watchdog groups.'' Benvenisti liked the
situation to an automobile manufacturer's taking over the department
of motor vehicles and then creating the national safety standards to be
imposed on cars.
................
McAfee annonced that Adelphi Univerity, Pace University and Sarah
Lawrence College were selected to perform, jointly, product testing and
evaluation of antiviral measures marketed by association members.

In additiion, John Cordani, assistant professor of management science
at Adelphi University in Garden City, will act as chairman of the
evaluation program and as liaison between CVIA and the testing labs.
``Precise arrangements have yet to be worked out,'' Cordani said.

McAfee said InterPath will continue to do initial, informal testing before
the software is sent out to the universities. ''Everybody has to test
using something. You have to test your software.''

``We are taking the hands-off approcahs,'' he said. ``We are not testing
our own products. We never had any intention to test our own products
We have tried to make this as completely impartial as possible. I don't know
how to make it any more impartial,'' McAfee said.

This did not satisfy other members of the antiviral community. Harold
Joseph Highland, editor of ``Computers & Security,'' Elmont, NY, said
``These are not the major computing institutions in the area. Whether they
have any people that know anything about viruses, I do not know. Most
schools do not have experienced virus researchers.''
Similarly, Jon R. David, Systems R & D Inc, Fort Lee, NJ, said there are
several very capable schools in the New York metropolitan area that are
more attuned to viruses than those selected. And although the specific
people chosen to work on the testing may be accomplished in their field,
there people are not in the computer science division or the math division
but they are in business administration, David said.

In addition, he said, the announcement of the universities made little
difference because the universities are testing CVIA's antiviral
softwae with NBBS's simulator. ``When it's your simulator, you know
with 100 precent certainty what you were going to be tested against.''
He likened this to a game of Trivia Pursuit in which you have peeked at the
answers.

``It's his (McAfeee's) simulator. Conceptually it (using universities)
makes it more valid. But you are not letting the industry agency run
tests, The agency does not have the ability to design valid tests. You
are giving them the testing tool. The results you know ahead of time.
It does not seem to be any more valid,'' David said.

McAfee said it was because CVA was adamant about putting all of the
software through testing that many vendors refused to join the organization.
``A number of people selling antiviral products chose not to be members
of the organization. It's the testing of the product that scared many away.''
He said there were vendors who planned on becoming members until they were
told their products would have to be submitted for tetinf first, and
then they had a change of mind.

Although McAfee said others were afraid to expose their products for
testing, David said McAfee refused to offer his software for testing.
David is assisting an international study of antiviral software
associated with Highland and his publication ``Computers & Security.''
When david called on McAfee to submit his antiviral software for testing,
McAfee refused. ``It striked me as being rather odd. He says (his
antiviral software) tests fine with a simulator, but he resuses to have it
tested in a real-world environment,'' David said. ''If I were in his
position, I would much rather go on luster than performance.
''Other members of his group (CVIA) are actively cooperating. Other
members seem not to find a real-world test abhorrent,'' David said.
``You can't play games like that. Give me one valid reason for him refusing
to send a copy of his software to test. Everybody else is anxious to
send their own.'' Several members of CIA have forwarded their software
for testing, David said, and a couple of those members indicated they were
interested in disassociating themselves from the organization.

When questioned about why they chose not to join CVIA, certain members
of the antiviral community gave reasons that had nothing to do with
having their products tested. Some said they did not like the way
McAfee was operating CVIA. ``McAfee is distributing viruses by disk and
bulletin board, which is a practice which is certainly questionable. The
harm (is) letting the little buggers out. If I was selling a bulletproof
vest, I would offer to test it in a controlled environment, but I'd be
damned to send live ammunition and loaded machine guns through the mail.
A virus is a potentially dangerous thing. You want this on a bulletin
board? In the mail?'' David said.

Pamela Kane, president of Panda Systems, Wilmington, Del., said ``John's
(McAfee) timing was unfortunate and his motives very questionable. Most
major developers and industry experts were involved with the PC Expo in
New York at the time his plan was hatched. We were told the press release
would be scheduled (for release) the following day and our decision to
participate had to be made immediatelty.


``In the absence of any information other than the text of the press
release, the lack of organizational planning and John's self-appointed
chairmanship, none of us were able to makr a business decision to participate.''

``Interestingly,'' Kane added, ``there was an opportunity for all of us to
meet in Boston within the next ten days---to meet among ourselves and to
appear before the Boston Computer Society as a concerned group of
prefessionals. John refused to meet with us.''

Several antiviral vendors refused to participate in the organization because
they said McAfee had put names on the membership lists before vendors agreed,
as a means of enticing others to join. ``He played the same game with
all of us,'' Greenberg said. While Glath, Greenberg and reimer all said
this same technique was used with them as a means of having others join the
organization, McAfee denied he lured members in this way.

Glath said, for example, that McAfee had told at least one vendor that
RG Software Systems was a member of CVIA, although Glath never agreed
to join. ``Since it (CVIA) is headed by a guy who is throwing most of the
type out, we said no (to joinin McAfee's organization).''

Part of the hype that Glath referred to is InterPath's Winnebago that
travels from infected site to infected site in the Silicon Valley region
of California, ``collecting virus residue,'' McAfee explained.

A 27-foot motor home equipped with special purpose hardwae for isolating
viruses, the ``virus bug buster'' loads up with tools and software and
drives out to the infected site. A visit from the ``mobile lab'' is free.

I don't know about "worms", but I've seen (perfectly harmless) programs
for the Mac called "measles" and "crabs," which produce similar screen
displays.

How the program got onto a disk which he says he's never shared with anyone
is another story, though.

If this *IS* a virus of some sort, particularly a (ugh!) network virus,
please let me know.  For the time being, I'm not going to post this to
Info-Mac because it doesn't sound suspicious and I don't want to generate
pan-network junk mail.  But I'll cross-post it if any more evidence turns up.

I thought it was very humorous:  putting the roman numerals on the end as

A little comedy break every now and then lightens the serious mood of this

I suggest a good dose of ethics and why virii are dangerous.  Last week's
episode was a good example of how even a 'benign' virus (worm, actually)
can cause major harm because the writer didn't anticipate its effect
on other computers.  The corolary to TINSTAAFL is: There Is No Such Thing
As A Safe Virus.

Dear Readers:

In an effort to improve the quality of VIRUS-L, I've decided to start
digestifying VIRUS-L.  Please note that it is not my intention to
censor submissions, merely to weed out irrelevant ones (e.g.,
one-liners like "SIGNOFF VIRUS-L", ASCII pictures like the ones we all
read recently, identical submissions).  Also, rest assured that
VIRUS-L will continue to be distributed in a timely manner.  Urgent
messages (virus warnings, etc.) will be distributed as soon as
possible, and separately from actual digests, which will go out once a
day, if any incoming mail exists.

I hope that in doing this, the quality of VIRUS-L will continue to
improve.  Note that GNU EMACS (rmail) users can undigestify individual
digests with an "M-X undigestify" command while reading their mail.

As always, I invite your comments and suggestions.

This should be the last non-digestified message (other than any future
urgent announcements) to go out.


Regards,

Ken
