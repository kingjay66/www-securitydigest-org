The anonymous FTP hole is *NOT* one of the holes used in the attack;
however, it is believed to have been discovered by Robert Morris, as
are the other bugs it exploited.

Hi,
   If your going after analogies, then when the robber breaks into
your house but doesn't steal or destroy anything, then he is charged
with breaking and entering.  This is basically what I think Morris
should be charged with, and there are appropriate laws that deal with
that.  He appears to be guilty and will no doubt be found such, but he
doesn't deserve to have his life ruined.  Community service or some
other such lengthy (but not costly to society) should be given.  .

No, it's the ftpd bug.  If you entered a long enough password, you
could get a shell with *root* privileges.
