For you chaps across the pond who haven't seen the August Virus
Bulletin yet, a couple of quick notes:

1.  Particularly for those who follow virus-l but don't get VB; Dave Chess's
    public letter (virus-l4 i126) leads the letters page, accompanied by
    editorial apologies.

2.  And for those of you do get VB; my copy is fine but I have heard of
    one subscriber who had blank pages in his copy, so check with the
    publishers if you have a problem.

This was a public informaton broadcast.

Ta ta for now, Anthony Naggs.

This came up a while ago; basically the answer is that scanning when
the door of the floppy disk drive closes (or a diskette is inserted)
is sometimes possible but inefficient. A better method is to scan when
DOS itself scanns the boot sector (it has code to work out if there is
any chance the diskette has been changed, and uses the change-detect
line if it is there). Such a TSR can be very effective in spotting
viruses before they do any harm to your system, and a good one (in
terms of what it catches, how few "false alarms" it gives, and the
miniscule RAM it uses), is SCANBOOT, available by anonymous ftp from
cantva.canterbury.ac.nz [132.181.30.3], and should be coming out of
comp.binaries.ibm.pc soon.

Hello,

A laptop that had come from Canada was thought to have a virus.  A few
different virus checkers were used to test the laptop and nothing was
found. A few weeks later the virus came alive. We did destroy the
virus, but it did corrupt some programs before its death.  Can this
virus fake out the virus checkers or do we have a nasty floppy disk
floating around the property? Any info/history on the 1575/1591 virus
would be most welcome.

If Den Zuk is resident in memory, and user does DIR on clean,
non-write protected diskette, the virus will infect the disk. But you
can't get Den Zuk in memory any other way than booting from infected
disk. This same thing applies to most boot sector viruses, too.

BTW, there's a mistake in Price Waterhouse's Computer Virus Handbook
under Search (=Den Zuk) entry. It says that Den Zuk survives a warm
re-boot, which it can't do. When user presses CTRL-ALT-DEL, the virus
draws red "DEN ZUKO" text on screen and boots the computer then. But
it won't stay in memory.

        This is something that keeps going back & forth. Certainly at the
        moment, the STONED seems have a lead over the JERUSALEM but  this
        is  a  far cry from being a statistic. Most of what I  have  been
        doing  lately  has  been cleaning J-B and  Sunday  off  of  LANs.

        Certainly  there  are far more "crude" file infectors  than  boot
        infectors  since  they are much easier to write. It may  just  be
        that the difficulty of writing a BSI makes for more "stillbirths"
        and those that do survive "in the wild" tend do spread further.

        As  a consequence, the "average" BSI tends to be more  successful
        than  the "average" file infector and they have received a  boost
        lately though distribution on manufacturers disks, a trend  which
        I hope should soon be curtailed.

        Tend  to  disagree: BSIs run before DOS loads and only  once  per
        boot while the WDEF resource is a part of the OS as  demonstrated
        by the System 7 exclusion, and is invoked often. A better analogy
        would be the Lehigh which goes exclusively after COMMAND.COM  and
        I doubt that anyone will disagree that this is a file infector.

        This  problem is quickly spreading to the micro arena. In  recent
        months I have had occasion to clean several LANs including one of
        500  clients  and another having 2000+  clients.  The  techniques
        developed to disinfect individual PCs (quarantine and clean)  are
        costly, often ineffective, and are not the One True Solution.

        Other  techniques  that  we have discussed  in  this  forum  that
        involve   authentication  of  the  health  of  a  client   before
        permitting  access  to  the  server  are  IMHO  a  more   elegant
        procedure.

        Depends  on  your  point of view. The Pakistani  BRAIN  is  still
        providing  a significant number of infections and was  the  first
        "stealth" virus. I suspect that the failure to spread far of most
        is because most of the "stealth" seen so far is easy to detect in
        memory  (most just with CHKDSK) and as implemented  causes  other
        problems by lying to the operating system. e.g. lost clusters and
        cross-linked files.

        On  the  whole, I agree with most of  Mr.  Slade's  observations,
        however  I suspect that the next great threat is going to  be  to
        the   LANs  via  file  infectors  and  unless  steps  are   taken
        immediately  to  protect them, serious disruptions are  going  to
        result.  Fortunately, there are solutions, and  not  particularly
        expensive ones, either in cost or reduced performance, just  they
        are different.

The author probably meant that if the computer is infected, the virus
will infect any diskette which is accessed, not that an infected
diskette could infect the computer regardless of how it was accessed.

Well, my only comment is about your comments... :->

Speaking as one who has written lots of dumb little programs to parse
various data files over the years, I do have one suggestion...

> # This is an imaginary signature file, by msa@phys.canterbury.ac.nz; 05-aug-91

> @00:00@017B:B40206CD130914

I would recommand, for parsing simplicity, that comments and data be
syntactically distinct. For example, anything after "//" is a comment...

// This is an imaginary signature file...
#05BXP7B.E1R,  "Stoned (variant 7a)", "PORTUGUESE STONED"
@00:00@017B:B40206CD130914
#0TEEGYB.RB0,      "Not harmful, MS-DOS 3.3 immunised by V-Basher 1.2"
17675A6C34D0@007E:17FFFF000023
#X587BG6.37Z-1280, "Dim Revenger virus"
19A6????53CD21ABBADABBAD00	// random in-line comment.
##IF OS=OS/2
- - -147:AC??55C9129B       // for code segments >64K
##ENDIF

It adds a minor bit of complexity to Really Dumb Parsers. It might be
better to do something like this:

# This is an imaginary signature file...
#!05BXP7B.E1R,  "Stoned (variant 7a)", "PORTUGUESE STONED"
@00:00@017B:B40206CD130914
#!0TEEGYB.RB0,      "Not harmful, MS-DOS 3.3 immunised by V-Basher 1.2"
17675A6C34D0@007E:17FFFF000023
#!X587BG6.37Z-1280, "Dim Revenger virus"
19A6????53CD21ABBADABBAD00	# random in-line comment.
##IF OS=OS/2
- - -147:AC??55C9129B       # for code segments >64K
##ENDIF

Again, Really Dumb Programs simply strip out anything after #. But now
smart programs look at the following character to see how to interpret
that line. ! is a code string, # is a directive, space is just a comment,
and so on.

Subject: Proposal for virus signature notation.

I have received several comments on the proposal. First let my clarify
the thoughts behind the proposal.

It was ONLY intended to achieve a standard notation method for virus
SIGNATURES and not a proposal for file formats, naming conventions and
other things.  With a standard notation, it is very easy to check if
the signature you have just extracted from a new virus specimen does
not already duplicate the scan string in someone lese's virus report.
Comparing virus signatures from different sources if quite cumbersome
at this time, due to the many different ways people write up their
scan patterns. his usually forces you to do the analysis all over, and
then find out you already had all the info in an entirely different
format.

Also, I have has several suggestions to employ existing techniques
like Regular Expressions commonly used on Unix systems. While that is
a widely used notation, I think the use of regular expressions may
complicate the matter or make the notation too flexible and thus error
prone.

I realize that the proposal I wrote up isn't the only way, nor is it
the best way. But it is simple, straightforward, easy to implement in
just about any scanner program and doesn't rely on obscure algorithms.

Nor is the proposal a "law" telling every anti-virus program must use
this method. Whatever the internal workings of an anti-virus product
are, is up to the author. However, if the product allows the use of
externally supplied data, using a common format for the virus
signatures will prevent the double, triple or quadruple efforts of
converting virus signature data to the different formats used by
various anti-virus products.  And that will free up time to do more
useful things.

The main line is that the info published on detecting viruses should
be usable by as many inti-virus programs possible, without the need to
convert the info.

Subject: Boot Sector and Terminology (PC)

     Rob Slade notes that viruses are traditionally defined as
fragments of malicious code which attach themselves to programs.  He
notes however that the most successful viruses have not satisfied this
definition because they have been boot sector infectors on the PC
family or start-up resource infectors on the Macintosh.

     One can retain the original definition of viruses while
recognizing Stoned and WDEF as viruses if one defines "program"
expansively.  The boot record is a special-purpose program, as is any
resource contained in the Desktop file.  All viruses attach themselves
to programs.  Special-purpose program infectors have been even more
prolific than application program infectors.

Subject: Viruses in IO.SYS (PC)

     The question is asked by Willi Grueber in Virus-L 4.133 whether
IO.SYS can be infected by viruses, and whether any checker exists for
such viruses.  I assume that it is at least theoretically possible for
viruses to infect IO.SYS, although I have not heard of any virus which
infects it.  At least one anti- viral package, Virex-PC, can be
configured to protect IO.SYS, either by verifying its checksum at
startup or by intercepting suspicious writes to IO.SYS or both.  I
have it set up to do both.  Other anti-viral packages should also be
capable of protecting IO.SYS unless they are limited to files with
certain extensions.  However, even a checker which is limited to
certain executable extensions should be able to check *.SYS files,
because some Bulgarian viruses will infect installable device drivers
of type *.SYS.

     There is a risk that IO.SYS viruses can be written.  However, it
is a risk that can be anticipated and contained with a little
foresight.
