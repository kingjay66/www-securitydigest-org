VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

1.  My real concern was not incorrect use of "jargon" terminology so
much as incorrect characterization of the degree of public threat.
Viruses and worms, which do spread, do not spread to isolated systems
like telephone switches.  To suggest that they do is a disservice to
the public, who are likely to panic unnecessarily.

2.  We know now that the problem was not a time bomb.  I suggested
that I did not think that the problem was a time bomb.  The conclusion
that the problem was a simple bug (which I had always suspected and
had indeed posted to comp.risk) was published later than the date of
my quoted note.

3.  I was admonished off-line by a journalism student for making
unreasonable demands of journalists with a minimal number of
column-inches.  I do not demand that journalists define precise
technical terminology unless it is essential to technical
understanding.  The distinction between viruses and worms is not as
important in this context as the distinction between replicators and
non-replicators.  Bell Atlantic may have been vulnerable to Trojan
horses, time bombs, or logic bombs.  Bugs got them.  The press
suggested that there was a real risk from viruses, commonly understood
to mean replicators including viruses and worms.  I don't ask full
explanations from the press.  I do ask the absence of harmful error.
The _Washington_Post_ article contained harmful error.

Thanks - what great information!  I feel a lot better knowing this.  8-)

Is this _all_ that is known?  Why are you so sure it's a "virus"?  Are
you sure that you're not seeing the "aftermath" of someone having run
Norton Anti-virus on your machine?

Sorry - but with the "wealth of detail" you supplied, skeptics are
likely to wonder such things.

The new and updated How-to-write-a-virus book by Ralf Burger has just
been published - called "Computer Viruses and Data Security".

According to the publishers, the book contains the source code to
several viruses, so we can probably expect a new flood of variants
based on the published examples.

I'm not sure what the best response would be - a call for a boycott of
all books by Abacus might be a bit too drastic...but I sure don't

  Hi,

  I am a consultant.  I intend to provide training and installation

  I would like to demonstrate detection and cleaning of a virus.
  Could you send me a file with a virus in it that I could copy and

Installed DOS5.0 on my machine last night (which works well imho),
but ran into a problem with F-PROT.  If I attempted to leave the
F-PROT driver.sys in my config.sys file the machine would freeze

anyone found a work-around for this?

We have a similar situation here at UNT.  In my main lab, I have 15
PCs that are networked, but only have 2 floppies.  It is true that my
users can "only infect the memory" on these stations, but I *still*
don't want even that to happen.  So, we've installed F-DRIVER.SYS and
F-NET to prevent the users from running any program that might be
infected.  This is also a good way for me to keep tabs on the software
on the network.  If a student is suddently unable to run a program
from the network because F-DRIVER has prevented it, I need to take a
more careful look into the rights setup on my network to see who
infected the programs and how.

Protection is not a bad thing.  Using F-DRIVER is so simple and
painless, it makes almost no sense *not* to use it.  If nothing else,
it can act as a good advanced warning system for your network.

As with all the Anti-viral pacakages it has its pros and cons - while
not wishing to say it's any better or worse than others(It pays to sit
on the fence) I have found it a very good product. We use it widely
across campus in for staff and in student laboratories.  Additionally
the Leprechaun folks are very responsive to user input and a number of
Buster's features have come from user requests. Buy a copy and give it
a whirl.

I know a lot of people using TNT AntiVirus (me included) since about
half a year and there was so far no sign for such a Trojan.

Two questions raise from your problem:

1. What version do you use? The current is I think about 7.1.

2. Are you sure you got a clean copy? TNT AV is a commercial product, where
   you have to pay for normally. How reliable is your bulletin board you got
   it, when it "distributes" commercial software ??????????

Subject: Need prg to write-prot HD partition. (PC)

Pardon the wide distribution, but I am in sort of a bad situation, and
need a specific piece of software to help me out.

I am in desperate need of a reasonably priced utility that can
completely and securely write protect a directory branch or logical
partition on a PC hard disk while allowing unimpeded read access to
the protected branch/partition AND full read/write access to the
remaining branch(es) or partition(s).

The problem is simple: I've got 22 computers to put in four public
student computer sites.  These computers will not have reliable access
to a file server, so software will have to be loaded on the local
fixed disk of each system.  I can't afford the staff or my own time to
constantly clean viruses, reload software, and reconfigure
applications on these computers.  So I'd like to set up part of each
computer's 40MB disk as a write protected partition.

The ideal utility would:

  1.  Allow full read/write access to the 10MB boot C: partition of
      a 40MB fixed drive for swap space and temporary user storage.
  2.  Permit read-only access to the 30MB D: partition of the 40MB
      fixed drive for protected storage of supported programs.
  3.  Not be defeated by a user booting from his/her own diskette
      (D: would either still be read-only or be inaccessible.)
  4.  Be completely transparent to the user (no extra prompts or
      pauses during system start-up or reboot).
  5.  Be compatible with MS-DOS 5.0, MS-Windows 3.0, and applica-
      tions designed for a MS-DOS/Windows environment.
  6.  Provide a separate utility that, when used with a valid pass-
      word, provides write access to the normally protected D:
      partition.
  7.  Utility in #6 should allow the definition of more than one
      password and should keep a log of accesses for each system,
      so that different levels of maintenance staff could have
      access.
  8.  Be reasonably priced.  I have a limited budget, and can't
      afford to pay $200 per machine for this.

Of course I need to get the program, if its available, as soon as
possible so I can learn it, install it on the 22 machines, and get the
machines put out at the sites by Sept 1st.

If you know of any utility, be it public domain, shareware or standard
commercial, that might fill many of these needs, please let me know.
If you have written similar software and feel you could quickly and
successfully write a program to accomplish the above, I would be happy
to talk to you.

Please E-Mail your replies to me at medici@elbereth.rutgers.edu, or
call me at 908-932-2412.  I will summarize here if there is sufficient
interest.

At least the variant of Devil's Dance I have displays this message:

Subject: Index of Known Malware: 998 viruses/trojans

After weeks of work and excellent assistance of David Chess, Yisrael Radai,
Alan Solomon, Padgett Peterson and some others, I just published the "Index
of Known Malicious Software: MsDos systems". It covers most of the viruses
and trojans reported in this arena (similar indices for Amiga and Macintosh
to follow later this year). When summing up, I was deeply depressed: the
index counts:
                120 virus families ("strains)") with 59 more sub-families
                    with 744 viruses, variants and clones
                    plus   7 trojans,
                and      228 single (non-strain) viruses
                plus      19 trojans
                *** totalling 998 pieces of malware ***

Though some people (including Alan Solomon) foresaw 1,000 viruses later this
year, the rise in figures has been underestimated. As this development is
likely to continue, antivirus experts should cooperate even more strongly than
contemporarily discussed.

At the same time, the July edition of VTCs Computer Virus Catalog describes
                + 8 AMIGA viruses totalling 54 viruses
                +10 Macintosh viruses totalling 20 (out of 28 existing)
                +14 PC viruses/trojans totalling 84
The disparity between "virus known" and "viruses classified" (with the aim to
maintain a good quality over quantity of classification) demands other tools
and methods for analysis, classification and production of countermeasures. We
are working harder to a more actual version of Virus Catalog; I am glad that
Mr.Jahn joined VTC (for a doctor workm on secure databanks), and that Vesselin
Bonchev will join us next week for a (not yet specified) dissertation. On the
Moreover, I appreciate any cooperation with serious antivirus experts.

VTC documents (Index of Known Malicious Software: IMSDOS.791; Index of Virus
Catalog: Index.791; all entries classified up to now) are now available from

1.   Product  Description:  VIREX  is a commercial program which includes virus
detection, virus treatment, and virus prevention.  The program also  identifies
"major" Macintosh trojan horses.  The current version is 3.5 as of July 1991.

2.   Product  Acquisition:  The  product  is available from Microcom, P.O.  Box
51489, Durham, NC 27717.  There are also  several  mail  order  software  firms
which  market  VIREX, generally at substantial savings for a single copy.  Site

4.  Product Test:

    a.   I  obtained  a  copy  of  VIREX  from  MacWarehouse in July 1989.  The
purchase price at that time was about 30% below  the  manufacturer's  suggested
retail  quote.   The  registration form received with the software gave one two
options to obtain any future upgrades to the product.  The first option  was  a
$75.00  Annual  Update  Service.   For  this  fee  Microcom  (then known as HJC
Software) would provide automatic updates for a year.  The second option was to
purchase  single updates for $15.00 upon notification of any VIREX new release.
I chose the second option given  that  VIREX  at  version  2.0  identified  and
repaired  all  known Macintosh viruses as of that time.  I wanted to build some
historical knowledge as to the frequency with which updates might occur  before
committing  myself  to the automatic annual fee.  I have subsequently purchased
upgrades at the 2.1, 2.5, 3.0, 3.2 and now 3.5 version.
