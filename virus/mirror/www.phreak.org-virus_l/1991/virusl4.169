VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Does anyone have information on computer viruses that infect OS/2 files?
I thought I had heard something about an OS/2 virus.  If anyone has any
information I would like to hear about it.  Thanks!

This solution has the problem that it would make the scanner sensitive
to the version of PKLite which was used on the executable, which is not
a good thing.  Also, it would mean that it is possible for the scanning
process to *ACTIVATE* a virus, if a new unidentified virus was embedded
in the code which the scanner thought was the decompressing code,
whereas normal scanning does not.  Of course, shelling out to PKLITE to
decompress an un-encoded file runs the same risk.  There's always a price.

Current version of SCAN is Scanv82, it was released 15th of September.
It's available at HomeBase or from some BBSes, for example mine...

    HomeBase 2400      +1 (408) 988 4004
    HomaBase 9600/HST  +1 (408) 988 5138
    HomeBase 9600/V32  +1 (408) 988 5190

    or

    Virus Help Centre   +46 (26) 275710

About WindowsScan, yes! There is a product called 'Scan for Windows'
but it's still a Beta version. It will be released sometime in
September I think...

Hope this will help You!

Yes, it is true that PKLite'd programs have to be unexpandable so that
they may be executed, but your statement is more or less equivalent to
"Encryption isn't effective because the receiver has to be able to
recover the plaintext."  Any decent encryption makes the decryption
process non-trivial.  In this case, I don't know exactly what PKWare
does for these customized, numbered versions of PKLite, perhaps
crpyotgraphically it is a trivial change which can be broken, but it is
non-trivial to the end-user to recover the original.

Out of curiosity, if you state that the code can be expanded exactly,
then what is your intended pronoun reference in "They're just not..."?

I had not had direct experience with Greenberg's VirX.  I'm sure that it
is technically feasible to break whatever scheme PKWare used, though.
I'll try to remember to grab VirX to look at its documentation, but does
anyone know of shareware/public-domain programs which have been
compressed with a customized PKLite which I can play with?

   future users will be able to upgrade system BIOS by installing a new

   The one thing you could always trust to be safe from viruses was the
   system BIOS.  Can this be exploited by virus writers?  If so, how long
   before they do?


Although FLASH memory can pose a real danger in terms of viruses, it
is not quite as bad as people think.

As I understand it, in the chip there is a non-erasable ROM portion,
which can provide a "safe" way of booting the machine from a known
floppy.

Makers of the PCs with FLASH can disable writing the memory in
hardware, making updating the BIOS impossible without a specific
action by the user.  Similar to a write protect tab for a floppy.

In summary, yes FLASH memory should be a concern, but it is not the
end of the world for safe computing on PCs.

Not exactly. While COMMAND.COM only recognizes .COM, .EXE, and .BAT
files, DOS really could care less what you call it so long as it can
be loaded. For example, take a .COM file, rename it to any extention
(or none) and then load it with DEBUG and issue a G (go). It will
execute happily. Of course you could load a text file the same way and
the PC would try to execute it, just without much success.

I regularly give my device drivers funny names for CONFIG.SYS since
the same is true, whatever follows a DEVICE= is assumed to be an
executable that follows certain conventions.

Similarly, one of my favorite integrity management programs
(Enigma-Logic's Virus-Safe - plug) regularly informs me of all kinds
of strange programs being submitted with extensions such as .MNU,
.PRG, .BIN, and a myriad of .Oxx (overlays). Windows also adds its own
suite of funny files.

The good news is that viruses that take hold before DOS rarely infect
files and those that infect executables will generally get a package's
.EXE or .COM first.

For this reason, generally, SCANing just .COM, .EXE, .SYS, & .Oxx
files is enough for a warm and fuzzy feeling. Once a virus strikes,
better use the /A (all) switch and have a cup of coffee handy.

No! Really!  It's not a joke.  I've got three macs sitting on the

periodically.  The belch does not replace the normal beep sound, it

still remains audible.

I've looked in all the obvious places for inits, system extensions,

 Virus Simulator Equal Time

 September 20, 1991

 I've been asked to respond to a number of questions and comments on my Virus
 Simulator  2.0 and although my response may be lengthy, it will  not  exceed
 the length of postings of it's detractors.

 Like most users of this forum, I read far more comments than I post and  for
 some  time  I've been following the endless "my anti-virus  programs  better
 than  yours"  debates. Each purchaser of software should have the  right  to
 make  that  determination  for themselves, but had no  hands  on  basis  for
 comparison.  I  wanted  to participate in the debate  but  wished  to  avoid
 offering  "opinion  above knowledge", so I wrote an  information  extracting
 engine.

 My  engine runs an anti-virus program against real viruses and then  reports
 not only how well the anti-virus program works.... But how it works and what
 it's looking for. Producers of anti-virus programs often go to great lengths
 to  guard  this information, but I found no encryption technique  they  used
 that could stand up to my engine.... none.

 (The  existence  of this engine was described in this public forum  by  Ross
 Greenberg some months ago.)

 It  became  obvious that my engine not only didn't allow end  users  to  try
 anti-virus  detectors themselves, but raised more security problems than  it
 answered.  Keep in mind that the author of a virus already has  that  virus,
 its source code and a demonstrated willingness to defeat security  measures.
 My engine reports that missing information in considerable detail.

 Most suppliers are anxious to give prospective buyers a chance to try  their
 products,  and my Virus Simulator 2.0 makes some measure of  that  possible.
 Before writing it I contacted as many producers of anti-virus products as  I
 could.  I  wrote  letters, made phone calls, left E-MAIL  etc.  Most  didn't
 respond. A few took a "wait and see" attitude and some gave me  considerable
 support.   Only  one,  Frisk  (Fridrik  Skulason),  indicated   his   strong
 opposition.

 Out  of the respect I have for efforts Frisk has made in this industry,  and
 the  strong  desire he announced privately and on this public forum  to  not
 participate  in my experiment, I removed his programs from the test. I  have
 no  desire to breach anyone's trust or divulge any secrets. Understand  that
 the  reason  Frisk's  program does not report a much  higher  percentage  of
 discrepancies when used with my Virus Simulator 2.0, is that at his request,
 his program was not included. Any false alarms (as he calls them) are due to
 the common search strings his programs shares with other programs. For Virus
 Simulator 2.0, I did not run my engine with Frisk's program and any viruses.

 I consider the term "false alarm" to be somewhat misleading when applied  to
 my  simulations.  I  believe a false alarm to be when  your  virus  detector
 stumbles across a legitimate application program and reports it as infected.
 Make  no mistake, the file, boot sector, memory reports Virus Simulator  2.0
 generates are not accidental. They are quite deliberate and can be  directly
 related to their real virus origins by design.

 Room  for improvement, you bet! That's why I made Virus Simulator  available
 and solicited comments. I intend to make future revisions far more  complete
 and validation to real viruses more formal. My collection of real viruses is
 very  limited  and far from complete, so many of the strings used  in  Virus
 Simulator  2.0 were supplied. To make future versions of my Virus  Simulator
 more  useful  to its' users, my library of viruses  will  need  considerable
 improvement.

 I've  supplied  copies  of Virus Simulator 2.0 to Robert C.  Bailes  of  the
 National  Computer  Security Association (phone (717) 258-1816,  FAX   (717)
 243-8642, 227 West Main Street, Mechanicsburg, PA 17055). Mr. Bales will  be
 discussing  the  participation of the NCSA in future revisions of  my  Virus
 Simulator  with  the  Product Developers Conference  advisory  board  Monday
 September 23, 1991.

 The  choice of whether you use my present Virus Simulator, or not, is up  to
 you.  I  make  it  available  as shareware  to  all.  Without  access  to  a
 comprehensive library, I can't make a better version of my Virus  Simulator,
 so  in  effect, the choice will be made for you by the same people  who  are
 asking you to purchase their products on faith alone. Let them know what you
 think.

The current version of VIRUSCAN is Version 82.  Version "83" has apparently
been pre-empted by someone other than McAfee Associates.  It may be an old
version of SCAN renamed after the number of viruses it detects, or it could
be a trojan horse, perhaps.  I would recommend that anyone who comes across
a V83 to delete it.

I can.  These are beta versions of CLEAN-UP and SCAN For Windows, a

SCAN4Win3 hasn't.  And he spelled "McAfee" wrong too.

 Indeed, according to the goals and yardsticks decreed for the
 medical test to which a comparison is made, false negative rates
 arising from the use of the Virus Simulator cannot be measured.
 However, it's known _a priori_ that false negative rates should
 not exist, because it's known that each test file produced by the
 Virus Simulator is *expected* to give a false positive. This can
 never be expected to be the case in the medical testing mentioned.

 However, the inherent fallacy of the comparison arises from the
 following consideration: in the medical field, there are no
 _intelligently malicious_ diseases that intentionally set out to
 confuse and misrepresent diagnostic test results. It is valid to
 make the assumption that, if a given test result turns out to be
 falsely negative, or falsely positive, it is so because of
 primary deficiencies (inaccuracies) of the test.

 In the virus/antivirus field, such a consideration is invalid.
 Infective agents (as well as test agents!), may be designed with
 prior knowledge of weaknesses of the upcoming testing procedure,
 and made to avoid them or compensate for them with secondary,
 tertiary, etc. deceptive techniques.  In such cases, false negatives
 could be much higher than expected and yet could not be considered
 "abnormal" or "false" - they were intended, as all other activities
 in this field.  And, to the extent that the detectors fail to
 anticipate and neutralize such secondary, tertiary, etc. evasion,
 they fail in their purpose.

 Conversely, false positives, such as produced by the Virus Simulator,
 can themselves be used as an avoidance mechanism, by robbing the
 user of confidence in the antiviral product. THIS IS THE EFFECT THAT
 THE ANTIVIRUS PUBLISHERS OBJECT TO IN THE VIRUS SIMULATOR, not any
 lack of efficacy.  How can such an action be accounted for by the
 above theory?  It cannot be.

 And, to the extent that the detectors fail to anticipate and
 neutralize such false triggering, they fail in their purpose. They
 fail because they are not only technical detectors, but *detectors
 of maliciousness and of intentional deception*, and should be
 competent in this as well.

 Virus detectors do not only undertake to detect viruses, they also
 undertake to avoid deception tactics used by viruses. If they cannot
 do this, they may be said to have failed in their purpose, because
 so many viruses use deception techniques.  As long as the virus
 scanners can be deceived by the Virus Simulator into believing that
 the simulations produced by the Simulator are actual viruses, they
 may also be said to have failed in their purpose.

 Analysts of the virus/antivirus contest might perhaps search for
 theoretical foundation not in the realm of medical diagnostics,
 but in the theory of warfare, whose rules and tenets more closely
 resemble our reality.  Considering that the author of the article
 seems to have military affiliation, one is surprised that, in his
 search for theoretical justification, he was attracted by medical,
 rather than martial, theory.

 It most certainly can be so used. However, the results of its use in
 testing are not what the author promises. The Virus Simulator does
 not test accuracy of diagnosis, but rather the overall "credibility"
 of the detectors.

 After such tests, the detectors emerge with incredibly low marks.
