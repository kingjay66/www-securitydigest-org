Subject: Authentication of PCs to Servers (PC)

	Tim Martin of the University of Alberta asks about removal of
viruses from networked systems from the server level. Actually this is
something that I have been thinking about for some time and would have
some special requirements possible only with networks. It would
require some (not much) specialized programming and a knowlege base
resident on the server. There are some problems however.

	In the first place, it would be possible to maintain a
knowlege base on a server that would allow comarison of a known good
PC signature with its current configuration. Secondly, it is possible
to include in that data base a known clean path to the disk or memory
that could bypass even a resident stealth virus to be used for
restoration. The major difficulty would be cleaning memory remotely
since the server cannot cycle the power switch without help.

	The problem is that when a server discovers an infected
client, that client must already have an active infection. If the
infection is active, it cannot be trusted to do ANYTHING properly. For
this reason DiskSecure was deliberately written to force a boot from
floppy disk in this case since it would be impossible to trust any
software execution on an infected machine.

	True, a generic disinfection could be written to clean the
disk from a known virus without interception, but at some point,
control must be returned to the operating system and this cannot be
trusted. You cannot even trust a software generated reboot.

	Thus while the server could force the client to authenticate
itself, if authentication fails, it cannot be trusted to "fix" itself.
Programs could be written to remove viruses that are known, but what
about the unknown ones and varients ? Don't forget that servers do not
run the client software. They must rely on the client CPU for
execution.

Jeff Dycus (DYCUJA@morekypr.BITNET) asks:
>Can someone (anyone) please send be some info on:
>
>1)  The nVIR virus family, and;
>2)  The WDEF virus

nVIR is the standard for a two-part Mac virus. It consists of an INIT
resource and several code resources, all disguised as "nVIR"
resources.  An infected program, when run, adds the INIT resource to
the System file along with the other nVIR resources. As each program
is run, the virus modifies the CODE 1 resource to add code which will
write the virus into the system file. This cycle of System file, to
application, to System file, allows nVIR to spread to unprotected
applications and System files.  It is easy to detect the nVIR
"pattern", so clones with different resource names (a common practice
for a while) can be taken out with one generic set of code.

WDEF takes advantage of the resource search path under Systems
previous to System 7. The WDEF 0 virus consists of a WDEF 0 resource
which "front-ends" the standard System WDEF. The "front-end" code
copies the viral code into the Desktop file, which is opened by the
Finder when a disk is mounted. Since nothing actually has to be
executed for the virus to spread, it spreads very fast.System 7 blocks
it automatically, because the Desktop mechanism has changed.

A side note on WDEF: if you have installed any of the numerous WDEF 0
replacements (AltWDEF comes to mind), which add function to the basic
window, WDEF will not be able to spread. This is apparently caused by
AltWDEF's blocking of attempts to substitute another WDEF for itself.

The solution we use (although we only have two such labs, and only use
this method for one presently) accomplishes 2. and 3., although it is
not a boot-up process, but a weekly maintenance task.

Every Saturday, the operations staff here take the time to boot each
machine in the lab from a specially-prepared "wiper" diskette.  The
diskette is programmed (via autoexec.bat and some special widgets
written in-house) to format all logical hard disks in the machine,
rebuild DOS, and reinstall the necessary drivers to connect to the
network.  Additional programming handles some special cases: one
machine in the lab is a "languages station", which has Fortran, C, and
Pascal compilers installed; another is a "printing station", which has
mirrors of publicly available software configured to print to a
LaserJet printer.  The main special widget identifies what machine
it's in based on the Ethernet/Token Ring card installed, configures
appropriate drivers based on that identification, and uses a special
login to download the language and print installations from the
server.

Since the process is based on a (cold) boot from a write-protected
diskette, infections on the hard drive do not carry through to a
freshly wiped machine.  Reformatting takes care of boot sector
viruses; we are currently working on one of our widgets so that it can
automatically rebuild and overwrite the partition table for a complete
"wipe".  Although it is a weekly task rather than a boot-up process,
it has worked for us so far; the process takes about 5 minutes for
standard machines, about 20 for the languages station, and about 35
for the print station (60 meg disk crammed full of software).

Two products may interest you:

1. Virus Buster from Leprechaun Software Pty Ltd
	PO Box 134, Lutwyche, QLD, 4030 AUSTRALIA
	Fax +61 7 2524071, Ph +61 7 2524037, BBS +61 7 2524104

In their anti-viral sweet provide DISKLOK.EXE and DISKLOK.SYS.  These
provide the facility to make the hard disk invisible from a floppy
boot and also automatically disinfect many of the boot sector viruses
including the ubiquitous stoned virus.  After disinfection your PC is
rebooted with a clean bill of health.  DISKLOK doesn't work for AZUSA
which does not save a copy of the partition table.

2. Thunderbyte from Calmer Software Services
	361 Somerville Rd
	Hornsby Heights NSW 2077, AUSTRALIA.
	Ph +61 2 4821715, BBS +61 2 4821716

Thunderbyte is a short card which provides hardware virus prevention.
I've only had a brief look at this one but it appears promising.  Its
ROM sits above C000 with the standard AA55 signature and is executed
prior to the A: / C: boot and has many anti-viral features. eg;
ability to disable card during booting, ability to warn of attempts to
write to hard disk, ablity to warn of attempts to change R bit on
files, ability to check changes to interrupt vectors after a program
has run, ability to capture the disk interrupts while booting, ability
to monitor any changes to programs, ability to prevent internal access
to DOS + more. There is also a password protectable configuration
program which provides additional features.

Subject: Scanning Compressed Files

Lately there has been concern about viruses being spread by compressed
EXE and COM files (see Aviel Roy-Shapiri's message in Issue 120 for an
example.) Newer Scan versions of Scan and VirX will now scan inside of
PKlite and LZexe files. The exe files only problems with this is: 1)
Scanning inside of compressed files is not always always reliable 2)
There are a lot of other compression methods other than PKlite and
LZexe (Diet, TinyProg, Lexm, Axe, Exetrx, Srnch, Ice and ExePack are
examples.)  and 3) Some of these compression methods can't even be
decompressed.

So what can be done? There is a little known IBM program called VSTOP
that will reliably detect viruses inside of any compressed executable.
The way it does it is to scan the file while it is being executed (and
already decompressed.) This is the only program I know that works in
this way (please correct me if I'm wrong.) IBM currently doesn't
distribute or support this program. Maybe if enough people show
interest in this program, IBM may distribute this program (maybe even
include it with there VirScan package.) Any comments on this are
appreciated (especially from Dave Chess or anybody else from
IBM.)...<MM>.

This week's ComputerWorld (July 8, 1991) quotes John McAfee (p. 106) as

Why would anyone want to buy what they can hardly avoid getting anyway?
Why would they want to pay for what so many of the rest of us are

Not only would I consider it irresponsible to make such a purchase,  I

nVIR contains two virusses, nVIR-A and -B, together they create a new
virus.  Both nVir-a and B are not that dangerous, they delay CPU-time
and can cause some troubles when you make use of Telnet.

"You're application has unexpectedly quit .."

I have no experience with the new virus created by the both nVirs, so far.

My experience with WDEF so far:

Some applications cannot be started, are cause a restart.

You can use SAM 2.0 or higher or disinfectant to clean files infected
with the nVIR(A/B) or WDEF virus, just make sure you scan/repair in
the Finder only and restart immediately after repairing (otherwise the
virus stays in memory)

I don't see the use of that kind of simulation, so I would agree. 

But what about simulating a PC environment (DOS, floppies and hard
disk with files, boot sectors etc.) and virus infection mechanisms?
In this environment a student could try and see what happens when a
virus is in the system, when it spreads, where it hides, what the
effect of deleting files, restarting etc. is. All that of course
without any real virus code, just functional simulation.

In fact, that's just how a program recently developed at TUM behaves.
VIRLAB 1.0 has a trace mode so that novice users can easily follow
infection paths. A restricted DOS is simulated; some minor executable
programs are supplied that perform I/O. Help windows and information
windows (only in German up to now, sorry) give help on available
commands and information about the state of the simulated system.

Any simulated virus is simulated only in respect to the classification
given in VIRLIST.TXT (copyright/courtesy of McAfee). Thus no special
viral effects (e.g. sound, texts, grahpics) are simulated, and
individual methods of infection or doing damage are represented by
'typical' behavior.

Any objections to THAT kind of virus simulation?

Subject: Microsoft up to their tricks again... (PC)

After the DOS 5 SETVER self-modifying EXE debacle, comes another
Microsoft-aided generosity product towards viruses: Windows 3.1.

The word on the bus is that 3.1 will join the legions of programs
that insist on modifying their installation disks. Windows 3.1
will require you to enter your name and Company name which will
then be splashed on every "About" box going.

However it will modify some data on the install disks to do so.
Everyone knows (I hope) that the biggest spreader of viruses in a
corporate environment are Micro Support. If every machine has to
modify the install disks, the chances that somone like me will
catch a rogue virus from the installation machine are massively
increased. This virus can then spread at will though the next
machines to be installed.

** FLAME ON
I know that this is a technique employed by many nefarious
software houses but surely Microsoft are beyond this rather
childish method of copy-protection. Just as you will never
stop any other crime, you will not stop software piracy by
half-assed phsychologically inept "guilt/blame" methods.
** FLAME OFF

Apart from that, I still like Microsoft, honest!

Subject: Re: Reviews of anti-virus software

With reference to the recent reviews of anti-virus software in PC Plus
- - it really is very difficult to do an unbiased review of anti-virus
software.  I can see several sources of bias.

1.  The choice of viruses used in the test.  A subset of all possible
viruses is used, and within that subset, a selection of instances of
each virus is used.  If the subset used, is that same as the subset
used by one of the vendors, then that scanner will score 100%, even
if it would have scored perhaps 50% if a wider subset was used.  There
needs to be some sort of disclosure on this commonality of the subsets
of the viruses.

2.  The criteria used for the review.  For example, there was a review
several months ago, in which about 50% of the scores were given for
getting the names of the viruses "right".  Since there is no agreed
naming system, "right" in this context was used to mean identical with
one particular naming system.

3.  What is important?  For example, how important is disinfection?
If a vendor believes that it is unimportant (or even dangerous), he
will not implement it, and will downrate a product that includes it.
If a vendor believes that it is useful and important, he will downrate
a product that leaves it out.  So a connection between a reviewer and
a vendor can affect the way that products are judged.

As Anthony Naggs posting points out, it is important that any review
includes a full disclosure of connections.  In the case of the PC Plus
review, it was worth disclosing that:

Sophos (one of the vendors of anti-virus software) owns Virus
Bulletin.
Bates (one of the vendors) is a contributing editor of Virus Bulletin
Hamilton (the writer of the review) is a regular contributor for Virus
Bulletin
RG Software (one of the vendors) is the US distributor of Virus
Bulletin (according to a recent posting on Virus-L).

I think that the only recourse is to disclose the connections
when doing reviews (of course, the ideal would be not to have any).
Such connections can be entirely innocent; nevertheless, they do
introduce sources of bias, as above.

Disclosure of my connection:  I work for S&S, a vendor of Anti-virus
software (Dr Solomon's Anti-Virus Toolkit) and publisher of Virus News
International.

Subject: Re: Link-viruses in packed, self-extracting programs (general)

It may be worthwhile to note that after the first, subsequent compressions
tend to yield much diminished returns unless the later compressors are far
more efficient than the earlier ones.  So I think it is unlikely that one
would see multiply compressed files.

For example, say I have an executable, P.EXE, which is 100k in size.
I use LZEXE to produce, say, PLZ.EXE, which is, say, 70k (which is not
unreasonable, I think).  If I were to then try PKLITE and produce
PLZLITE.EXE which might be 67k, would I bother with the extra loading
time for such a small gain?  Probably not.

Of course, it's possible that someone might compress many executables in
a batch, and not notice, or perhaps compress as a policy, and not care.
I guess recursive-unpacking scanners will become available, either through
necessity or simply to top the other guy's bulleted feature list.

Interestingly enough, most reviews I've seen seem to suffer from a
case of "Gee, I don't really know nuttin' about anti-virus software,
but I got a job to do"-itis.  I've been affiliated with a number of
different journals over the course of the last few years, been
Technology Editor here, freelancer there (and, currently, on the
Editorial Board of Virus Bulletin).

Undisclosed interests aren't half as bad as ignornat reviewers, in my

But Mark does, at least he did the last time I checked.  He's gotten
some from me, personally.  He's a well respected individual in the UK
trade press and has been a true friend to the cause of getting the
*truthful* message out regarding the virus problem.  It might be wise

Yes, I do consider him a friend, and wish he lived on my side of the

So what?  If Ed paid enough, I'd write for VB, too.  Frisk, Tech
Editor of VB, certainly isn't going to do anything to make the Sophos
product look better than it really is against his own FPROT product.
Ray Glath writes for them, too.

There is the idea of editorial integrity.  Ed Wilding, in my opinion,
has worked hard to attain that integrity.  It is an easy thing to lose

sort of reality.  In this case, they're not.

Hamilton is *real* journalist.  I would think that only a sufficient
number of scantily clad nubile your 16-year old females are going to
be enough to get him to say a dishonest word.

Heck, if the 16-year olds are willing enough, I'd be dishonest in this
case, too.

Again, so waht?  Make Virus Bulletin an offer, and they'll make you a
local distributor, too.  Most of the anti-virus folks I know have a
number of other business interests: Ray's anti-viral stuff is only a
portion of his business.

Yup: Mark hacked an old copy of FLU_SHOT+, found a gaping hole, and
sent me code to fix it up.  I incorporated the code, gave him credit,
and he wouldn't take any money that I offered him.  I shuld offer him
some money again and see if he accepts it this time.

The last review of my Virex-PC program in in VB, by Hamilton, should
lay to rest any myths regarding VB's (or Hamilton's) lack of
integrity: I personally feel the review was inaccurate and that the
wrong version of the code was used.  Lots of problems with that
review.  Ed Wilding did call me up on the phone and apologize for the
review: I didn't even think of asking him for any retraction and I
*know* that even asking would have been unprofessional.  Wilding did
tell me that a response from me (or from Microcom) would be printed in
a later VB.

He kept his word.

Ah, but what you write *does* suggest that you have a problem with
either Hamilton's credibility or VB's or both.

The crux of the problem, certainly.  Did you, by any chance, have the
opportunity to forward a copy of your code to VB for inclusion in
their review(s), or did you expect them to track you down?

As long as we have a favorable response to the freebiew VIRx, we'll
continue producing it -- as far as I'm concerned.  I am not the
marketing dude at Microcom who likely consults with some old bones and
tea leaves to determine what makes good marketing "sense".  To the
*very* best of my knowledge, the program will continue onwards into
the foreseeable future (about 12 months is as far as I'd be willing to
hang my own credibility on, though)

In all fairness to Microcom (please rememebr that I am but the
programmer, ok?)  chances are that you were sent your free-upgrade (I
think you started with version 1.1a, right? If so, then you probably
have Version 1.2).  Those who are subscribers to the update package (I
think they charge something like $50 or $75 for it) should have been
advised of the updates at the least and should have been sent those
updates.  If not, please call 919-490-1277 and make a big stink?  It
irks me to think that I bust my chops to make good code and they might
be sitting on it for some obscure "marketing" reason.

The original contract I had with Microcom called for four updates a
year: we've been averaging one every six or seven weeks for the last
three or four updates.  Notifications cost a lot of money when sent
out to tens of thousands of people.

But, yeah, I wish that everybody were notified an that they updated.
It kills me to walk into an establishment and see somebody using code
over a year old!

There's a new release due out momentarily, but the current release of
FLU_SHOT+ is version 1.82.  The new version will have only a few changes:
   *it will no longer be a bundled archive/zip with the VIRx stuff, breaking
    the tie in between the two products
   *it will catch some new viruses before they go resident
   *some DOS 5.0 bugs will be fixed.

I owe Keith Petersen a new upload on FLU_SHOT+ but have been delaying
it pending the new update.  What makes FLU_SHOT+ a "slow update"
program?  Contractual obligations that make my first priority to
Virex-PC.

My apologies for the confusion.
