The Italian virus is probably the Ping Pong virus, a floppy disk and
hard disk boot sector infector that makes its presence known by making
a ball character (IBM ASCII 07, if I recall correctly) bounce around
the screen.  It could also be referring to one of the file-infecting
viruses created in Italy by "Cracker Jack," although this is unlikely
as there have not been many reports of this family of viruses.

To remove the Ping Pong virus from a hard disk, power down (shut off)
the infected PC, insert a clean (virus-free, that is) DOS boot disk,
and switch the power back on.  This will allow you to boot up with a
clean copy of the operating system.  Next, run the DOS SYS command
(filename SYS.COM) by typing "SYS C:" at the prompt.  This will
overwrite the existing infected boot sector with a clean one.

SCAN V80 detects the Ping Pong virus quite well (it's one of the few
things that hasn't been changed in a long time), so another
possibility you may wish to consider is that it's a false alarm from
NAV, or correspondingly, it could be a new variant of the virus that
SCAN V80 doesn't detect.

Hm.....I was replacing my old 100MB ESDI disk with a 640MB SCSI disk,
and had them both installed while I was copying everything from the
old disk to the new one.  Much to my surprise the order turned out to
be:

	C: Primary partition on disk 1
	D: Primary partition on disk 2
	E,F,G: secondary partitions on disk 1
	H,I: secondary partitions on disk 2

Well, I agree that it is wise to use a couple of packages, but
conflicts like this may arise when a program does not keep its
signatures encrypted internally or wipe the memory after use....

Won't this leave a window during which the user can insert a floppy
disk?  Insert floppy but leave the drive door open, press
control-alt-delete, close the door.

I use a homebrew disassembler that I call "loot". It uses a command
structure similar to something that Christiansen (?) wrote for CP/M.
It allows you to assign a name/label to an address, and then see the
effect immediately, and then take corrective action or better guesses.
There is provision for comments, and ways to separate code from data.
It is to be driven by the person who is cracking the code.

Unfortunately, at the time that I wrote this, I knew very little about
C (I used small C from Hendricks (sp?)), and had no info on what an
.EXE file looked like. So there are some limitations, like a bug in
detecting one of the opcodes, comments that may not be more than 127
chars long, .COM files only and then no bigger than 32 K. I published
a disassembly of the Stoned virus that was produced with this program,
if you need to see an example of what it can do.

I've not seen anything to beat loot, and I can disassemble stuff
pretty quickly, thinking on the screen as it were. I've tried Sourcer,
and admire anyone who can get it to produce what loot can.

The program could do with a windows package added to it, and I could
probably dig out the source code from somewhere if someone feels
enthusiastic enough to soup it up and let me have the improved
version. I really don't have the time or desire to do any improvements
myself.

Subject: Re: Norton Anti Virus (PC)

Probably Nortons anti-virus detected it's own check-string... But you
could not be sure! There are several methods to detect viruses, and
the most common are checking for a known string. Another method is
checking for irregular jump instructions in the startupsequence of the
code.  If a disc-access occurs very early in the program execution,
there may be a virus. Most viruses are assembly-coded to be as small
as possible, and programs written in another language will execute
more code before accessing the disc. If the norton program checks
itself, there will be early disc access, and resulting in a indication
of a possible virus.

This wasn't a real answer, but an idea of a possible explanation.

I have also been using Sorcer. The other disassembler you can use is
the Turbo Disassembler plus CodeView. The later two are not very
helpful. Sorcer gives at least in my experience better comments.

I was wondering if someone out there could answer a quick (hopefully)
question for me.

     I just downloaded the July 31 version of the virscan.dat
(vs910731.zip) and ran tbscan on my computer.  The virus checker
complained about ALOT of file saying "infected by [file compress by
EXEPACK]."  Now most of the stuff it flagged was MASM 5.0 related
(although there were others).

     Is / was there a virus problem related to EXEPACK and should I
delete these files -or- is the checker just being _cautious_ ?

Thanks... (trying to avoid deleting the entire /bin directory ;-) )

 Frisk,

  Thanks  for  making the effort once again let readers of this  forum  know
  your  opinion  of my Virus Simulator 2.0 program. I was  disappointed  the
  first  time  your  comments were posted on this  forum, weeks  before  I'd
  written  it.  It's  now  available  from a  number  of  sources  if  you'd
  reconsider actually trying it.

  Compuserve as "VIRSM2.COM", EXEC-PC and several other BBS ( including SLO-
  BYTES (805) 528-3753 ) as "VIRSIM20.COM".

  Although  appreciated,  your  opinion  seems to  be  overshadowed  by  the
  overwhelming  majority  of  positive reaction I've  had  from  people  who
  have actually tried my Virus Simulator 2.0 for themselves.

  Even though your comment that perfect virus detectors will not find  these
  simulations, and any that are reported are false alarms, I don't  consider
  those setting off your own F-PROT to demonstrate a defect. Rather,  system
  administrators  can  use  my Virus Simulator to  determine  if  anyone  is
  actually following their security policies and really using your  product.
  They  can  demonstrate which products are the fastest and easiest  to  use
  when  considering  vendor  recommendations for a site  license.  They  can
  perform their own tests, and needn't take anything on faith to form  their
  own opinions.

  It's  not  my intention that anyone be placed in the awkward  position  of
  trying  to convince potential customers that their product  performs  well
  with  real  viruses,  even  though  it  fails  to  find  the  simulations.
  Especially when a collection of hundreds of real viruses is not  available
  and  confronted with a competitors product that finds the  same  simulated
  viruses without difficulty.

  So far the response and cooperation from producers of anti-virus  products
  to  my  Virus  Simulator 2.0 has been  overwhelmingly  positive.  I'll  be
  updating  Virus Simulator periodically, so if you'd like  to  participate,
  I'll do my best to see that your product detects my simulated viruses.

Subject: LANs and virus propagation (PC)

Here are some thoughts and questions about viral infections of a
NetWare file server.

It is my understanding that standard NetWare disk device drivers do
not support direct sector addressing through either the BIOS interrupt
13h or DOS interrupts 25h and 26h.  I also believe that the MBR is
different than a standard DOS MBR.  As such, a virus which infects the
DOS boot record or the MBR would likely overwrite areas of the disk
used by NetWare.  In doing so, would cause the system to crash, or
prevent the server from loading properly.  Therefor it seems that
booting a server from a boot sector infected diskette would likely do
terminal damage and could not execute normally.  So in theory, it is
*not* possible to infect a Novell file server with a boot sector virus
by booting the server from an infected diskette.  Any comments?  Would
such an infection first require that a NetWare device driver be
installed on the server that would allow special calls from the virus
to access individual sectors of the disk?  (an unlikely scenario)

As for file infecting viruses:

If an executable file, which is stored in the DOS partition, were to
become infected with a normal file infecting virus, would it be
possible for this virus to execute properly?  (i.e. SERVER.EXE) It
seems that a file infecting virus could *not* successfully write to a
NetWare partition because of the redirection of BIOS and DOS
interrupts.  I also don't believe that the virus would be able to see
a file being opened by NetWare.  Is my understanding correct, or am I
off track?

A final question, not intended as a malevolent thought provocation!
Could a "NetWare-specific" virus be written that could spread through
normal file infection, normal DOS boot record infection, and could
distinguish between a normal boot record and a NetWare boot record,
and infect both?  It seems possible.  Any thoughts?

The correct answer is: 1... switch the power off, disconnect both the
controller and power supply cables to the hard disk, do the
experimentation, switch the power off to the computer, wipe all the
diskettes with a magnet* and then restore the cables and then power
on, reformat all those diskettes again, and run some virus checkers
regularly - just in case you forgot a diskette!

*When wiping disks with a magnet I've found that the best thing to do
is keep the diskette in its dust jacket (the thing that protects the
exposed slots in teh envelope from dust), wipe the magnet over the
entire surface, both sides (if you have something a lot more powerful
than the sort of magnet that sticks little plastic things on the
fridge, well, you might not need to be fussy). The ability of magnets
to completely wipe diskettes falls of surprisingly quickly with
distance. Reformatting alone isn't safe enough since:
(a) there might be a part of the virus on the 41st track, probably it will never
    get executed, but you want to be safe, and
(b) if you reformat a 360Kb diskette on an AT's 1.2Mb drive, the virus can
    survive! (anyone that wants an explanation can e-mail me).

Above all, be careful! 2 out of 3 careful virus researchers I know of
locally have infected their computer accidentally once. You really
have to concentrate, and leave clear warnings or lock the room the
computer is in!

Hope this helps,
Mark Aitchison.

Well, there really in not a better disassembler as such, but Sourcer
is not the best for analysing viruses. I'm still waiting for the
disassembler that can handle viruses well.
