Subject: computer virus ^2

We've heard all about the usual stealth computer viruses and "armored"
viruses that are being written these days.  It seems that in some
places the writing of nasty viruses has become a national pasttime.
Some of these authors delight in finding new methods of damage and
camouflage.  The problem has mainly been for IBM PCs, and the most
sophisticated virus-writing has been in Bulgaria and the USSR.

Now, however, we have a new and far worse problem from South America,
according to the November 12th issue of the "Weekly World News."
[This is the "newspaper" you may find at supermarket checkout lines
with the kind of headlines you don't see in the more mainstream media.
Obviously, a conspiracy by the mainstream media.  The November 12th issue
is headlined with "Ohio Woman has a 3rd Eye -- in the back of her head!"]

On page 7, there is an article by one Sally O'Day, "special to the WWN,"
and entitled: "Demon Computer Kills 2 Workers!"  It is subtitled "Exorcist
called in after experts discover virus-bred evil spirit!"

The article goes on to explain how a computer system installed in a bank in
Valparaiso, Chile is possessed by a demon.  A consultant from the computer
company that installed the system claims that it must be the result of a
virus installing an evil demon that has caused:
   * observers to see a hideous horned demon appear on the screen
   * anyone who tries to turn off the machine to black out and fall to the
     floor
   * Carmen de la Fuente to have a fatal heart attack within 2 minutes of
     sitting down at the terminal
   * Maria Catalan to be found sitting at the terminal with her head in her
     lap [decapitated, I presume, rather than a contortionist]
   * a computer expert to began babbling like a madman when he got within
     10 feet of the terminal


This brings up many interesting questions:
   -- How long before commercial anti-virus vendors start advertising
      that their products work against this type of virus?
   -- Does the exorcism ritual end with extinguishing the candle, closing
      the book, and sounding the BEL?
   -- Could this actually be the result of using Ada rather than a virus?
   -- Do you know any computer experts who don't begin to babble when
      within 10 feet of a computer?
   -- Does normal business insurance cover an exorcism?
   -- Maybe it's a Unix system and this is the first time they've seen
      the sendmail daemon?
   -- Will Fred Cohen allow this to be entered in his virus-writing contest?

Or, it could be that Ms. O'Day has recently seen the movie
"Evilspeak"?
[If you have yet to see the movie, rush right out and rent it.  Lay in
a supply of beer and pizza, and invite the neighbors over.  It is a
classic wherein a nerdy Ken Howard (Ron's little brother -- the one who
used to hang out with Gentle Ben) summons up the devil on an Apple II
computer.  He should have guessed something was amiss when he started
getting Stardent-level graphics on his little Apple, and when it
started demanding blood sacrifices.  The credits include mention of the
"stunt demons" and "Satan's Sows."  Not to be missed.]

Hey, it must be true if they printed it, right? :-)

 Those are not virus families, those are single virus names. Since
 no information whatsoever is given as to which viruses he would like
 included in each of these "families", the list is not very useful.

 The list consists of over 270 names.  How does it relate to the NIST
 proposal?  Is it being suggested that known viruses should be simply
 divided into 270 "families", without any rationale being presented
 for such division, without even listing what individuals fall in each
 "family", or why?  That seems rather sloppy.

 At this rate, it might pay to just leave them alone, unclassified.
 Who needs classification, if the first level of subdivision consists
 of 270 taxa!      :-((

 This is an original solution and should be implemented at once.
 Thanks to Fridirik Skulason of Iceland. We need more suggestions
 like this one!

 EVERYTHING that happens on a computer is dependent on hardware
 capabilities.  Including viruses.  And antiviruses.

 Correct. It can be circumvented, and offers no inherent protection
 against malicious software, any more than any other software.
 Which illustrates that no software protection is ultimately useful;
 it can always be defeated by other, newer software.

   > ...just as any hardware "solution".

 False.  Hardware offers inherent protection which is totally
 undefeatable by software in the realm where applied.  This is
 not true of software.

 Runtime software is a function of hardware, but not the other
 way around. Hardware protection is permanent. Doesn't need to be
 updated for each new software attack.

 Fortunately, most computers in the world are not used for writing
 programs, and some restriction of the other parameters is readily
 allowable.

 Well, if I were a software publisher, I'd probably say the same
 thing.

 A virus can be _written_,  of course (anything can be written),
 but it cannot defeat sensible but simple hardware protection.
 Ever.

Subject: Virus removals vs. Virus classification

Writes frisk@complex.is (Fridrik Skulason):

 > This is not what was being said -

 What Vesselin Bontchev wrote was that because some virus-removal
 program managed to remove a certain virus from an infected file,
 then that virus must belong to the family of viruses for which the
 removal program was designed. First, the inference is not strict.
 Second, the "family" he was talking about remains un undefined
 entity. Third, from a technical standpoint, the use of a curing
 program to make a taxonomical classification is abominable.

 > The program in question is able to determine...

 A program isn't "able" to do anything. It does whatever it was
 programmed to do. Period.

 It doesn't determine any such thing. It only determines its
 infective effect on the file, not the virus' structure.  A great
 many viruses append themselves to the end of infected files and will
 change the beginning of the program to point at the virus so that it
 gets executed first.  If the size of infection and other changes can
 be determined accurately, the virus can be removed and the original
 program restored.  All this has little to do with "structural
 similarities" of the code, except in a most general and elementary
 way.

 > and that it can be removed in a similar way.

 Many viruses can be removed in a "similar" way. It doesn't mean they
 are taxonomically related.

 Note that I'm NOT SAYING that the Fu Manchu virus DOESN'T belong to
 the Jerusalem family - it may or it may not.  But using a virus-
 removal program as a taxonomical tool is improper - it isn't intended
 to be one UNLESS everybody agrees that all our virus classification
 will be done not on the basis of virus structure, nor on the basis
 of virus behavior, but on the ability of somebody's virus remover
 to recognize them... clearly a ridiculous proposition.

 I believe this is not true. As said earlier, virus-writing is not a
 cost-conscious activity, while antivirus protection most definitely
 is. Virus authors have the luxury of spending hours, days, weeks or
 months probing and testing until they find a weakness.  Antivirus
 authors work to earn a living, sell their products and must perforce
 be cost-effective. It's really just the reverse of what Padgett
 claims. And it's not true that defenders are "on home ground" while
 the attacker is not. Some virus writers seem definitely better
 acquainted with PC hardware and software than any antivirus
 publisher I know.  Witness, for example, the Whale affair.

 Anyway, the proof of the pudding is that, until now, the antivirus
 publishers have been reacting to attack, and usually unable to keep
 up. To this day, the antivirus publishers have been unable to take
 the initiative in the virus/antivirus contest.

 If the attacker thought as simply as the defender seems to in this
 case, the attack would indeed be made layer-by-layer, as Padgett
 suggests.  But it's often possible to bypass all of those "layers"
 in one shot. Quite a few viruses have done that. It's all a matter
 of ingenuity. All it takes is to find a new FORM of attack, and all
 the layers become useless. It's been done many times, as Padgett
 must know. For example: one can protect each and every executable
 and data file on disk with CRC and checksum checkers, etc. Then
 comes the Companion virus and blows right by all the defenses. So
 one erects defenses against that. Then comes the DIR II and takes
 care of _them_.  Enough said?

 Software cannot ever provide a permanent defense against software.

Note that there are two editions of Harlie....the second edition,
issued in the mid 1980s, was "cleaned up" by the publisher to remove

[explanation why compression is good deleted]

Oh, I didn't mean that there should not be an compressing programs!
What I think, however, is that all this has nothing to do with virus
scanning. Each producer of compression programs must provide a way to
decompress the compressed stuff. The virus scanners must only be able
to detect whether a file is compressed or not and warn the user.
Furthermore, we also need a shell that is able to decompress the
compressed programs, run a user-selectable scanner on them and delete
them if any viruses are found. Something like SHEZ does with the
archives.

Now, we don't require that scanners scan inside the archives, do we?
Or inside uuencoded, xxencoded, etc. files and all that jazz... We
only need a way to restore the original state of the program and then
we can scan it safely.

This is not a new virus - It has been known since Aug. 5, when it was
first reported by RG Software.  It is said to be known in the wild in
USA.  F-PROT 2.01 can detect and disinfect it, but I don't know about
other scanners (except SCAN84, which doesn't).

There are several menu-driven front-ends for archivers such as ZIP and
LHA, that can unpack and scan executables in archive files.  One that
I've used is SHEZ, which can make use of McAfee's SCAN program to do
the scanning.  Of course since during setup it asks you the name of
the scanner program you could substitute another one if you wanted.
It may be easier finding these programs on Fidonet.

Subject: Am I infected ? (PC)

My apologies to all and sundry if this is a FAQ, but I'm wondering if I am
infected :-).

My PS/2 55sx developed an odd condition without warning - memory is recorded
as 639K instead of 640K, but none of the anti-viral packages which I use has
been able to identify any virus being present.

It's a failure on my part, I know, but I wasn't aware that the RAM had been
reduced until I ran NEWDET (the only package which reports the size as being
suspicious) after installing a tapestreamer card.

At first, I thought that the newly-installed card was the culprit, but I have
printout (screen dumps) which record the 639K at an earlier point, and I do
recall seeing that size reported earlier without reacting to it.

I have asked around and discovered that a number of machines report 639K (one
reports 637) although none appear to have been infected.  The owners/users are
not unduly alarmed.

Since my machine is a transfer point for sensitive data via floppy I have no
wish to pass any potential infection on to the rest of my unit or indeed to
departments outside, hence my mild paranoia.

I had wondered if a PS/2 specific virus had somehow got itself into battery-
backed system configuration RAM, but I can find no sources of information which
would confirm/deny this possibility.

I have checked through a list of known viruses looking for one which fits the
bill, but without success to date.  If anyone can offer advice or (polite and
biologically feasible) suggestions, I would be grateful.

   There are certificates of security.
   They are provided though NCSC (the national computer security center).
   In my opinion, MS-DOS does, and always will, have trouble getting
off the bottom-rung of the ladder.
   However, as long as the acrediting agencies (hospital boards or
whatever) allow use of insecure, uncertified machines, in the
hospitals, we will have problems.
   When/How/If the FDA or other agency choses to require some degree
of integrity, there will be a BIG shakeup in the way in which
information is managed.
   Until then, I suspect they will continue in current ways.

According to the '386 book I have here,  LIDT is allowed  in real mode
so that  the processor can be   set  up for  protected  mode. The '286
should be the same.  But once protected mode is established (as  on my
virus proof (?) machine), the LIDT instruction can be used only at the
highest privilege level. So no virus hiding in  an application program
can do an LIDT.

Incidentally, I don't really like  the 80x86 series.  They all seem so
messy compared to more orthogonal processors, the most obvious example
being the 68000 series.  I chose  the 80386 simply because most people
reading this are probably PC people.

I think you must also deny reading executables. If not, for example, a
virus could READ an executable into memory and then  CREATE a new copy
of  the executable  which includes  the  virus. And to  the   machine,
re-creating an existing executable  would look innocently like someone

I  think you  must also  forbid  executables being turned into  'data'
files. If  not, for example, a virus  could turn an executable  into a
'data'  file, read the data  file, and then CREATE   a new copy of the
executable which includes the virus.

Could be knocked out  by changing  the file and/or   executable naming
system, so that two executables with the same  name cannot exist.  For
example, if my   machine  has lots  of  memory, why don't  we simplify
things and forget  about COMs, and  just have EXEs (or their non-80x86
equivalent)?  It'll probably be OK, as  applications   continue to get
bigger.

Yes, I was aware of this.  In reply, anything in  source code or ASCII
form should be easy to spot  in an  editor, or the  file dates will be
changed, or the files will grow etc.  etc. And remember,  there can be
no stealth viruses to cover up things like files growing!

As for anything like an OBJ or similar compiled code infector, I don't
think it will spread because...

1)      People don't tend to swap .OBJ files like they swap executables.
2)      Computer USERs (e.g. people  doing word processing) won't tend to have
        OBJ files anyway, even less swap them.
3)      Computer programmers in user clubs  etc. can swap source  code instead
        of the .OBJs.

...And    that  leaves  only  infected  .OBJ    files from  commercial
programming  packages  being copied amongst   users. I  would not have
thought a virus could spread much in these  conditions. True, they can
exist.  But spread very far? I think not.

See above for why I think we must forbid reading.

I think you got my  point, but I  don't quite understand your comment.
To reword my description: The switch is  a hardware switch mapped into
a protected I/O location. (Possibly a KEY switch to be  secure against
rogue  users.  But   that's  another matter).  The    I/O  location is
accessable  only  to  the  high  priority  O/S  kernel.  There are  NO
operating  system calls to  allow an application  to interrogate about
the state  of the  switch or  to  over-ride  the state  of the switch.
Therefore, the operating  system can  read  the switch, the  user  can
alter the switch WITH HIS HARDWARE KEY, but no virus can have anything
to do with the switch, apart from having its operation scuppered!

>

Maybe I've  missed something  which you have  thought of,  but I still
think we must disallow reading of executables.

>> Now that the  operating system is so  well protected, we have a  problem.
>
>Yeah, that it is not very useful... :-)

Well, I would'nt quite put it like that!

What we have achieved is:

1) Stopped all boot viruses.
2) Stopped all viruses hiding in the O/S code.
3) Stopped any virus going resident and patching into the O/S.
4) Stopped any virus attaching to an executable application.

What have we lost in the process?

1)      We now pay a little more for some ROMs.
2)      We pay a little more for a key-switch, but  most machines already have
        a keyboard lock. Maybe the two could be combined?
3)      It is a *little* more difficult to write a TSR/device driver etc.
4)      Technical Users  who want  to hack  about with  their machine  have to
        turn a keyswitch before they can read the executables.

What have we gained?

A massive improvement in security.  I think that viruses would  become
so difficult  to write  and spread   that  the machine  would  have no
noticable virus  problem, and certainly  nowhere near today's scale of
things for the PC.

So the  machine  is  USEFUL in the  sense  that it   can run  all  the
applications we ever need to with relatively good security.

But it is  not USEFUL in the sense that  it is not MS-DOS compatible.  I agree
with this, but see my later comments...

But  please  remember  my comment about   loading  device drivers (and
indeed, other TSRs) off a disk.

I'm a PC user doing university research in microprocessors. So  I know
a bit about  DOS programming, what a mess  PC's  are, and I know about
the 80386 protected mode. But I don't know much about Unix.

...and about 40 Million  PC users who  probably don't want to  upgrade
their machines.  Maybe   if   we  could  get  more   people  to  write
disk-trashing stealth viruses, we could *DESTROY* the MS-DOS world and
start afresh with *MY* new breed of machine?  Oooops, now I'm starting
to sound like a baddie from a James Bond film!

What I said above is exactly what happened.  SCAN discovered [Joshi],
and CLEAN said "1 virus found, 1 virus removed".  Re-running SCAN
produced "virus found [Joshi]" again.  In other words, CLEAN claimed
to successfully clean [Joshi] but apparantly didn't.  Each time I ran
SCAN, I did so after a powerdown and reboot w/clean floppy, and each
time Joshi was found on disk.

I thought about the "ghost" business, so I powered down the PS/2 and
rebooted from a clean floppy.  The same episode I described above
happened again.  Several times.  I would say that CLEAN really was
failing to remove [Joshi] from the PS/2.

I dunno why, but I suspect it's some peculiarity of the PS/2 at work
here.  Because all of the v84 programs worked beautifully on our
CompuAdd's and other clones.  And not only on Joshi--I've also had
the opportunity to use them on Keypress and Sunday.

ViruShell is a shell to simplify the use of McAfee's antiviral
products VIRUSCAN, NETSCAN and CLEAN-UP. It gives you a very
straight-forward and easy-to-use front to these programs as well as
adding som functions of it's own. ViruShell lets you setup all
options, path's and devices from extensive menus and then run the
McAfee programs in a window of the main ViruShell screen. These setups
can also be saved for later reloading in different setup files.

ViruShell is distributed as ShareWare, giving you a trial period of 30
days before deciding if the program suits your needs. Registration
unlocks a few functions as a reward for your support of the ShareWare
concept.

ViruShell incorporates among others the following functions:

* Automatically adopts to your system, sensing monochrome or color modes,
  as well as adopts to the condensed line modes of EGA and VGA, giving you
  43/50 lines on screen.

* A swift menu system that makes it easy to access the advanced functions of
  the McAfee antiviral programs.

* Full mouse support, works with all MicroSoft compatible mouse drivers.

* Memoryswapping functions to reduce memory requirements while executing
  external programs.

* Runs Scan, NetScan and Clean in windows on the main ViruShell screen.

* A context-sensitive hypertext format help system accessable from anywhere in
  the program with the press of a key.

* Current version comes in two flavours, english and swedish, other languages
  will follow.

Registered bonus features:

* Loading and saving of different setups.

* Autorunning of Clean to remove all infections found by Scan.

* Easy access to the VIRUSCAN AV functions, add and remove AV codes with the
  press of a few keys.

ViruShell utilizes all functions of the latest McAfee versions and will be
updated as soon as any new function is implemented in the McAfee programs.
