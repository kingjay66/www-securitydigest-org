A short answer: on a Mac, yes.  However, most of the Mac virus protection
programs do automatic detection on disk insertion.

On a PC: no.  Or at least, not with standard machines.  (I use an old NEC
laptop for my comm sessions, and it growls at every disk insertion so it
must be doing *something*.  But most PC's don't.)

I used to tell people that "why should a virus work on a network?
Nothing else does!"  However, that doesn't appear to be the case.

Because of remapping of interrupts by network "shells", many viral
programs will not work properly on a network.  However, a number do.
Network protection seems to be fairly effective against most, but not
necessarily all, of these, so networks do seem to provide a measure of
protection above that of "plain" MS-DOS.

The people at Novell do not like unsubstantiated claims of viral
programs that purportedly bypass network security, and you can't blame
them.  Unfortunately, substantiation is not always easy to come by,
vis the company that called me about a program which reported itself
as the "ICK virus" and was trashing their system.  In spite of the
fact that *they* were calling *me* as an expert in the field, they
would not allow me to examine their system.  Odd ideas of security
there ...

Subject: EMPIRE Virus (PC)

    In my previous alert on the EMPIRE virus, I had not yet seen the
second sector with the transposed text. Since then I have received
this also and thanks to WordStar (plug) here is the decrypted text.
Note that each sentance is a single line and relies on text-wrapping
by the terminal for legibility.

    After study, I suspect that the virus was written at first,
possibly with a different message, and had this message inserted
later, possibly by a different person - is this a quote ?

                                     Warmly,
                                             Padgett

Text of encrypted message follows:

I'm becoming a little confused as to where the "evil empire" is these
days.

If we paid attention, if we cared, we would realize just how unethical
this mpending war with Iraq is, and how impure the American motives
are for wanting to force it.

It is ironic that when Iran held American hostages, for a few lives
the Americans were willing to drag negotiation on for months; yet when
oil is held hostage, they are willing to sacrifice hundreds of
thousands of lives, and refuse to negotiate .......

Subject: Self-extracting archive files (PC)

We've had various discussions on the merits of "archived" and "self-
extracting" files for virus protection.  The following is from a local
bulletin board:

Original message from: Rene Blais, to: All -ffected by the presence of header a
nd
trailer information.

However, in the case of the newer "spawning" viral programs, this
procedure does nothing at all for detection, because "spawning" viri
never touch the original file, relying on MS-DOS's "execution order
preference" for .COM files, and creating a separate virus file.  The
separate file may be hidden from detection in various ways, and still be
"infectious."

Subject: SCUD Virus (PC)

We are investigating a possible minor infection by a virus which
infects the master boot partition record of IBM compatibles and which
can be identified by the letters SCUD appearing in its body.

At present we know very little about it other than the fact that it
appears to corrupt the hard disk and may also (in another
incarnation?) corrupt the CMOS, specifically be changing the floppy
disk type configuration.

We are still at a very early stage of the investigation, i.e. we
haven't separated the facts from the misinformation yet, so I
apologize for the vagueness.

If anyone has any knowledge of such a virus, I'd appreciate it if they
got in touch with me ASAP.

Thanks,  I'll post the eventual outcome.

I have an IBM-AT that won't boot from drive c:, but comes up fine from
a floppy, at which point the c: drive seems to be okay.  FPROT114
f-fchk tells me my files are fine, f-syschk tell me my memory is fine,
however f-disinf tells me I have joshi but fails to cure it.  I tell
f-disinf to cure it, it says I'm cured, but if I run it again it again
tells me I'm infected and the computer still won't boot from the hard
disk.

Is this an FPROT bug?  Am I prehaps multiply infected?  Can I trust
the identification of Joshi and preform the above sector 9 to sector 1
copy, or does FPROT's failure indicate more serious problems that the
copying won't fix or will make worse?

Thanks for any help,
Paul McGuire

My friend's hard drive has been infected by the Joshi Virus.  It's
taking up about 4-6K at present, and it's messing with his 5 1/4
drive...  He ran a program that is supposed to kill viruses, but it
didn't help.  Does anyone know how to get rid of this particular
virus?  Any help will be appreciated.

	I got a copy of the virus from my friend.  I did find a copy
of the original boot sector on the disk (floppy) not sure about the
partition table though since my hard drive is not infected, it was
located on the second to the last sector.

	Does anyone know does this virus infect all floppy or just some?

I am planning to write a program to write the orig boot sector back. Since
my version of clean does not reconize it yet.  Are there any virus expert
against this?  Say so fast, my program is almost ready..

Subject: EMPIRE virus (contd)

Since the last posting (Virus-L and Valert-L), yet another strain of
the EMPIRE virus has appeared. For the moment it would seem that the
University of Alberta (Canada) is the only victem. The second strain
has the same charactoristics except that this one is encrypts each
infection differently.

For the moment, the best detection is by the intitial JMP which is the
same in both strains and is the viruses signature to itself. "EA 9F 01
C0 07" - jmp 07C0:019F, this will pick up both.

ntg!dplatt@apple.com (Dave Platt) of New Technologies Group, Inc.
Palo Alto CA:

Can anyone out there validate this. If so what does the Version 1.2

Yes, the WDEF virus on the Macintosh can do this.  By the time the
icon for the floppy appears on the screen, ALL the disks shown on the
screen will have been infected, both hard disks and floppies.  WDEF is
benign, and is easily deleted, and is detected by Virex before the
icon appears on the screen, but the answer to your question is yes.

WDEF is the only virus I have been hit with.  A friend sent me a text
file with a description of (you guessed it) WDEF infections!  I also
got a shrinkwrapped diskette from a software subscription service
which had WDEF on it, but by then I had Virex on the system so the
system did not pick up the WDEF.
