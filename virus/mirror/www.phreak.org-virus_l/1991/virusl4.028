Subject: Model of "Safe" (PC)

	For some time now I have been rambling about "layered"
protection for PSs running MS-DOS (with modifications the same would
be possible on any OS), but now can make a stab at putting a model
together that would contain all of the necessary elements to provide
protection from malicious software with minimal user and performance
impact:

1) Prevent cold boot from floppy - can only be done with hardware unless
   already in BIOS. Only element that must be in hardware though can also
   do others. Note: element (2) can DETECT malicious action from a cold
   floppy boot but cannot prevent it if drive A: is present.

2) Password access (if desired) in absolute sector 1. Software redirection
   can hide hard disk from normal floppy boot. Authenticates disk access
   mechanism to prevent "stealth" infections. Protects partition table, hidden
   sectors, & boot record from writing, entire disk from low level format
   once resident. Can also prevent any warm floppy boot.

3) Internal executable authentication scheme. All files in system have
   separately stored signature & are authenticated prior to execution.

4) Known viral signature checks for any unknown executable presented for
   execution. User permission required & tracking instigated.

5) Background floppy access task: signature checks for malicious software
   in system areas of any floppy on door closure.

6) Warm Boot trap; prevents boot from unknowm floppy. 5 & 6 could be used
   in multi-machine or networked environment to prevent importation/
   recognition of "outside" floppies.

7) System configuration monitor: detects any attempt for a program to go
   resident or any attempted addition or change of an executable file. Has
   list and configuration of programs permitted to do so. Could exclude
   programs known by (3).

Of these, the only one that has any performance impact would be item
(4) but by confining it to executables presented for execution, this
should not be significant.

Right now, I believe only FLUSHOT and DR. PANDA attempt (7) though do
not keep record of permitted programs - most users disable this
feature from incessant alarms. John McAfee's VSHIELD makes a first
pass at (6). No one (that I know of) is trying (5). Several products
do a good job of (3) Certus' CERTUS, Enigma-Logic VIRUS-SAFE, VSHIELD,
BEARTRAP. Some of these do (4) also (CERTUS, VSHIELD) I wrote
DISKSECURE (beta copy sent to Ken via USnail) as an experiment to
cover (2), and have heard a few rumours of products doing (1) but have
not seen any, most have been password schemes with no anti-viral
functions.

Point is, to block malicious software properly, a layered approach
consisting of ALL of these elements is necessary. Impact - my guess
would be 5 seconds on boot, 250 milliseconds per 50k of known
executable presented. 2 seconds per 50k of unknown executable
presented, and about 4k of RAM on a 286 @10 mhz.

Additionally, (and I am basing this on installations I have done)
there would be a one-time hit of 3-5 minutes while signatures are
generated to install.

I know there is some rdundancy indicated, but that is because nothing
I've seen that does everything (just like no-one checks Int 2E for a
pseudo-TSR).

My feelings are that given such a scenario, while malicious software
would not be impossible to write, difficulty would rise at least to
the same degree as for VMS, MVS, or a good Unix.

[Ed. I saw one product which seems (IMHO) to come close to this -
PC/DACS by Pyramid (note: I have no affiliation with them...).  It
provides boot protection, optional hard disk encryption (required to
prevent absolute sector access), username/password protection, file
access control, etc.  Anyone with experience with this, or similar,
systems care to comment?]

hello

I found the SUNDAY virus on some of our PC's and deleted it.  But I am
sure that I got not all copies, because there are a lot of people
using this PC's.  Now my question: What is the trigger condition and
the damage effect of this virus?

Depends on your idea of AI.  Some say any program that is user
friendly, say by not giving you menu choices that you aren't allowed
to perform at the moment constitues an "expert system" - a form of AI.
If you're referring to something extravagant that tries to figure out
what some program is up to, by searching a large AI database then your
latter answer is probably correct - it's overkill.  You'll be wasting
more memory, disk, and cpu than it's worth.

A virus must be able to "execute" somehow.  If a satallite is just
relaying "data", then no (unless of course some type of "trojan horse"
was planted already in the satallite's program to be "triggered" by
some data - but this would not truly be a "virus".)

Similarly to number 3 above, the program must be able to "execute".
All these files do that.  ".doc" and ".txt" files don't execute - so
hooking some viral instructions on could be done, but would accomplish
little execpt to probably corrupt the affected file.

Here's an interesting angle... It is technically possible to write a
virus out of ".bat" file instructions to propogate itself to other
".bat" files.  I've never seen or even heard of such a thing.  It
would be relatively easy to detect and remove, and it would be
blatently obvious to find out everything about it (what it does, how
it spreads, etc.) so to make such a virus would probably be an
exercise in futility.  But the point is simply that it is "possible"
by virtue of the fact that the ".bat" file is executable.  You can
carry this a step farther.  If it is possible to infect a ".bat" file,
then it is also possible to infect, interpreter "basic" programs,
"dBase" programs, and practically every other "interpretive" language
- - even a spreadsheet macro could be infected.  (although I'm not
fluent in macros so I'm uncertain about the ability of the macro to
"propogate" itself to other spreadsheets - the language in use imposes
restrictions upon what a virus can get away with.)

This brings us to your final question about source code.  Yes, a virus
can alter them.  But they can't execute unless they're compiled.  So a
virus here can't propogate without some intervening action.  In most
languages the virus would be obvious to anybody examining the source
code, but I can think of at least one way to plant a virus that would
almost NEVER be detected without a lot of thought (to someone browsing
the source) - so the dangerous possibility does exist.

There is a new variant of the 5120 (Basic, or Vbasic) virus in
existence.  I finally got around to looking at a disk I recieved a
while ago and it turned out to be a variant of 5120. McAfee's Scan V72
does not identify it. It seems to functionally similar, but I cant say
yet.

2) Are there  anti-virus  packages  (for  PC  or  any  computer)  that  use
artificial  intelligence  techniques  to  protect the system, or is such an
effort overkill?
.......
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
To avoid mistaken ideas wasting much time and email space, I better explain
a few points re AI (= Artificial Intelligence). There are two sorts of AI:-

(1) 'Expert system'. This is merely a very complicated computer program  of
the  ordinary type with a lot of decision and test instructions, written by
a programmer to try  to  copy  what  some  particular  human  expert  knows
already.  The  actual  intelligent agent is not the computer or the program
but the programmer. Whether you  give  the  name  'expert  system'  to  any
existing viruses or antivirals is merely a matter of definition.

(2) Genuinely intelligent (sentient) computers and computer  programs  that
try  to  copy  how  the human brain works, capable of abstract thought etc.
These have not been fully developed yet. They need a  (real  or  simulated)
neural  net  computer. (There are existing now real neural net computers to
do specialized jobs,  e.g.  I  saw  a  mortgage-risk-assessing  neural  net
computer  said  to be as good as a skilled human mortgage assessor.) To run
such a thing via a simulated neural net on an ordinary computer would  need
impossibly  much  store  and  run  time.  It  is  a  sufficient feat for AI
experimenters to simulate small  bits  of  intelligent  brain  on  ordinary
computers:  e.g. read the new periodical 'Neural Networks'. Highly parallel
computers like the 'Connection Machine' which is like 2**16 micros siamesed
into a 16-dimensional hypercube, may perhaps be more  readily  programmable
this  way.  Whether each present or future make of highly parallel computer
and neural net computer will be liable to  viruses,  (and  whether  silicon
neural   net   computers  will  be  liable  to  (infectious  or  otherwise)
psychiatric disorders like biological brains  are),  remains  to  be  seen.

Several MS-DOS platforms can do this (Zenith, Compaq) and any PC could
impliment it by storing a flag in CMOS. However, only a few
manufacturers have chosen to impliment it in the BIOS (it must be done
in ROM).  Unfortunately in the case of my Zenith, it will only look
for disks that its BIOS can find. Failing this it will check for a
floppy even if told not to.  (I have a hardcard that uses its own ROM
extension and no matter how the CMOS is set, the Zenith will always go
for the floppy first.) Computer Shopper ads indicate that a 386 BIOS
chipset (choice of several) goes for about $70 but I do not know if
any of those replacements impliment this.

Incidently, there must be an override somewhere or maintenance would
be a nightmare.

What happens with new viruses?

I belive that is more useful to prevent virus contamination than try
to clean a system when it's infected.  I have a new anti-virus
product, (named COMPUCILINA), this program vaccinate other programs
(aplication ones, system programs, and a disk boot), and guarantees
these programs will not be infected.  COMPUCILINA offers protection
agaist actual and future viruses.

Subject: fund for Vesselin Bontchev

Every one knows Vesselin Bontchev as a reliable source of early
warning and descriptions of virus problems occuring in eastern
countries.  In december 90 I had the pleasure to meet him personally
at the international conference on computerviruses held in Hamburg.

Some might have noticed that there are no more contributions from him.
This is due to his p r o m o t i o n. He was appointed head of the
national computer virus lab of Bulgaria!  -- This means he had to
return his PC to his boss and move to a different office within the
Bulgarian Academy of Science. Now he only has a phone (this one works
but is only in house) and a desk *thats all*!!!!  The promised PCs and
personell has been cut to zero too.

The Micro-BIT Virus Center at the University of Karlsruhe now collects
material and funds to help him. We figured out a way to legally
transfer these things to him without having him pay customs *and*
being certain that the material arrives at its destination.  So any
organisation or person that is willing to contribute shall contact me
at the address below.

Thanks for your efforts in advance

I would greatly appreciate it if I could get a little input on the

     How does EliaShim's VIRUSAFE compare to McAfee's SCAN?

     Any comments on VIREX for PC's or VIRUCIDE?

     How would I go about obtaining F-PROT?

[Ed. Check out Robert Slade's reviews of Virex-PC and F-PROT; both

We too, tried to negotiate a site license for the McAfee software here
at the University of California Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.  Since
we have at least 500 IBM type systems, you can imagine what kind of
cost we were faced with.

Since we don't like to spend the taxpayer's money frivously (that's
YOUR money, folks!) we decided not to offer McAfee this huge windfall
for the privilege of locally distributing his software.  We ended up
negotiating a site license with IBM for their VIRSCAN software.  The
price is right for that one!

You might consider getting virus protection packages for a few people
and put them on special write-protected system floppies.  Then they
could be moved from system to system to check for suspected
infections.

At Miami University we distribute Disinfectant for Macintosh computers.

We have a copy of Virex-PC for individual cleanup use.  Virex seems to
have a lower cost site license, but we really don't have a management
structure that is consistant with purchase of PC/Mac product site
licenses unless the cost is quite low.

I would also be very interested in how other universities are handling
the anti-viral problem.  Is anyone using F-Prot.  Does Fredrik
Skullasan (appologies to FS for spelling) have a site liscence policy?

Subject: Q: Do I Have a Virus --> answered :-) (PC)

Many thanks to those who responded. As you recall, I had two machines
with identical numbers of bad bytes on their hard drives, which made
me suspect viral infection (vi).  I solicited responses from this
newsgroup, and received many replies.

I downloaded McAfee's scanv74c (or whatever the latest version is)
from the SIMTEL20 archives, unzipped it, ported to my PC, did all that
was required, and found that no viruses were present on either
machine. Barring the possibility that I have a new viral strain, or
one which is not checked as part of McAfee's list of 166, I have
reason to believe that the chkdsk numbers were just coincidence -- it
is a known fact (ref: a reader from South Africa) that hard disks come
with defective sectors.

For those interested, I accessed SIMTEL20 via
ftp 26.2.0.74
and downloaded with the following:
binary
get PD1:<MSDOS.TROJAN-PRO>SCANV67C.ZIP
get PD1:<MSDOS.TROJAN-PRO>SCANV67B.ZIP
Since I am quoting some older mail, and I have newer versions,
try downloading
ascii
mget PD1:<MSDOS.TROJAN-PRO>00-*
which will give you the index of that particular subdirectory, which
contains many helpful utilities and virus information.

Thanks again to the Army, the NewsNet community, and all the people
who took time to respond.
