Subject: Norton SI 6.01 and Cascade? (PC)

I just installed Norton Utilities version 6.01 with DOS 5.0 running on
my 386-25.  The SI (system information) utility has a function to list
hardware interupt usage.  When I make this selection, it reports
[Cascade] grabbing interrupt 2 (IRQ 02).  I scanned the machine with
McAfee Scan v. 84, and F-prot version 2.01 and neither report
infection.  Can anyone tell me what is going on here?  Has anyone else
seen this with Norton 6.01?

I realize that Cascade is harmless but I don't want it around.  Also,
when I look at the interrupt usage with Quarterdeck's Manifest it
shows IRQ 02 being used by the system ROM.  I'm confused!

Hmm... Let's see...

square left bracket = [ = x'5b' = b'0101 1011'
curly left bracket  = { = x'7b' = b'0111 1011' = x'5b' + x'20'

square right bracket = ] = x'5d' = b'0101 1101'
curly right bracket  = } = x'7d' = b'0111 1101' = x'5d' + x'20'

backslash = \ = x'5c' = b'0101 1100'
vert bar  = | = x'7c' = b'0111 1100' = x'5c' + x'20'

I suspect that your tape drive has a sticky bit in it someplace.

True Story:

When I was working at Clarkson, back around 1983 or so, we were the
recipients of a donated Gould PN/9080 computer.  Eventually, the time
came to upgrade from UTX/32 1.0 to UTX/32 1.1.  Gould informed us that
there was an incompatible change to the filesystems, so we would have
to dump everything to tape, and re-'mkfs' the disks, and then restore.

I set aside a long weekend for this.. dumped the whole system to tape
(took like 9 tapes at 6250BPI), and then dumped a *SECOND* time to 9
other tapes, which I then stashed off in a corner.  I then spun the
upgrade tapes, and reformatted the disks.

So now I have a nice shiny new 1.1 system up and running, ready to
restore user files.

The tapes won't load. Period.  Neither the first set, nor the second.
Tried *all* the backup tapes from the daily backups. Bad too.  'restore'
just says "not in backup format" and barfs.

Finally, after some 36 hours of panic (which included about 6 hours of
poking at the backplane with a logic analyzer while trying to decipher
schematics that I wasn't sure corresponded to the installed hardware),
I found the problem.

It seems that a chip had gone bad in the tape controller board installed
in the backplane, such that of the 8-bit data path to the tape drive,
bit 4 would be correct for 4 bytes, then *inverted* for 4 bytes...
The tape drive never reported a 'read after write' error because the data
was already bad when it arrived at the drive.

The cure was to (a) Install a new tape controller and (b) write a dumb
C program to front-end 'backup' that basically did a

for (;;) {
   read(tape,buffer,bufsize);
   for(i=0;i<bufsize;i++) if ((i % 8) > 4) buffer[i] ~= \010;
   write(backup,buffer,bufsize);
}

Subject: 12 Trojan Tricks (PC)

Has anyone seen this one yet?  One of my users' PCs was acting
strangly, so I checked it out and found a series of minor problems,
including STONED and this 12 Trojan Tricks (it might have been 12
Tricks Trojan).  Using the copy of Mcafee's SCAN/CLEAN that they had
(6.7) I was able to remove STONED, but 12 T.T. just VANISHED.  SCAN
had reported it as being in a self-incripting file called LZEXE, so I
went looking.  That file didn't exist.  SCAN couldn't find it again,
either.  I tried CLEAN again, just in case it could hide from SCAN,
but no luck.  I finally tried to reboot the machine -- it wouldn't
boot.  Norton (5.0) reported the C: drive's partition table as being a
device driver.  Before we run FDISK and DISKEDIT -- has anybody else
out there run into this thing and if so what did you do about it?

Subject: Question re possibility of virus migration: Dos -> Xenix

I have a simple (hopefully) question that I need some information on.

One of our clients uses a Dos PC to run an application on a Xenix
machine.  They use Kermit as the communications software.

They recently reported to us the possibility of a virus on their Dos
PC but have no details as to the type of virus (if any) - I am trying
to get this from them.

Their concern, and my question, relates to the possibility of the Dos
virus migrating to their Xenix machine and infecting that. Given that
Xenix effectively runs as a partition on a Dos machine (or rather a
machine with a Dos BIOS) what is likelihood that a virus can migrate
to the Xenix machine.

My gut feel is that this is most unlikely but I have no real basis for
making any positive statement to our client. My suspicious mind can
only think of the possibility of a clever partition table infecting
virus that can somehow travel to the Xenix machine and infect its
partition table.  Is this likely? Possible?

Many thanks in advance for any replies, information, etc on this.

This won't help, since you'll inevitably miss some - the general
question whether a program is infected or not is undecidable...

Well, if you permit the disk to be writable at least for some time,
you still risk infection.

>     ... Prevent the users from ever copying or compiling a program.

Aha, that's one sound theoretical method (not practical? oh, who
speaks about practical methods... <grin>). More exactly, you need to
LIMIT THE FUNCTIONALITY. That's one of the methods. The others two are

	... LIMIT TRANSITIVITY. That is, the user A could give
information to user B and user B could give information to user C, but
it must be against the rules for A to give information to B, which B
then passes on to C.

	... LIMIT SHARING. Divide the users in clusters and the
clusters into integrity levels and forbid information to be read from
the lower integrity levels (lest it can corrupt you) or infomration to
be written to the highest integrity levels (lest you might corrupt
them). There is a more general model of limited sharing, based on
partially ordered sets, but it's too complex to explain here. Those
that are interested could find it in the excellent textbook from Fred
Cohen "A Short Course on Computer Viruses", ASP Press, 1990, ISBN#
1-878109-01-4.

For those that are getting bored by my constant quotations of Fred
Cohen - it's not my fault that he usually turns to be right and uses
to supply proofs to his claims.

However! He's also far from perfect and also makes mistakes. For
instance, his basic proof of the undecidability of detecting a virus
by appearance is basically incorrect! Not that the problem is not
undecidable, but the proof that it is, as provided by Cohen, contains
an error. However, describing it will require a separate (and quite
longuish) posting...

Well, my personal preference is 1) Yes, 2) Maybe, 3) Maybe, with

You're right, it won't (well, more exactly, the program I described
does, but it uses a separate method for Slow, so it doesn't count),
and I, just like you, tend to put Slow among the other Jerusalems...

No a Commodore cannot be infected if you do what most people do and
turn off the machine after each program because the operating system,
and the interpeter is also ROM resident so unless the virus has hands
and can reprogram ROM then you have nothing to worry about.  Also it
seems there are less people trying to write virus programs for
Commodore.

The old INIT-29 virus on the Mac's had a VERY effective way to bypass
the write protection on a diskette.  It put up a message box saying
the disk needed 'minor repairs' and instructed the user to turn the
write protect off so they could be made.  It would block mounting the
disk unless you did.  (True, this involves the user, but so does any
other virus infection.  Viruses ONLY spread when USERS run infected
programs.)  All you have to do to get around a write protect tab is
fool the user into thinking there's a legitimate reason for writing to
the disk.  With as many gullible people as there are, write protect
tabs not only aren't 'totally perfect', they aren't even near perfect.

It should be noted that the "Desktop" viruses (WDEF and CDEF) do _not_
infect System 7. This is explained in the online Disinfectant manual.

"...System 7 is completely immune to the 'Desktop' viruses (WDEF and CDEF).
These viruses never activate, spread or cause any damage under System 7....
..Under MultiFinder, the Desktop files are always 'busy'..."

This goes on to say that Disinfectant cannot affect changes in MultiFinder.
Since it cannot chnage it to repair it, it is safe to assume that the file
cannot undergo changes to be infected with the virus in the first place.

Hmmm...maybe Apple is finally getting smart. :-)

Neither idea will work, since even if all programs had the same exten-

Conference is to provide a forum for anti-virus product developers,
researchers and academicians to exchange information among themselves
and the public.  NCSA/ICVP '92 will consist of advanced seminars,
tutorials, open forums, distinguished keynote speakers, and the
presentation of high-quality accepted papers.  A high degree of
interaction and discussion among Conference participants is expected,
as a workshop-like setting is promoted.

ICVP '92 is sponsored by the National Computer Security Association.
Cosponsors include Network World and Washington Technology.

Because ICVP '92 is a not-for-profit activity funded primarily by
registration fees, all participants and speakers are expected to have
their organizations bea r the costs of their expenses and
registration.  Presenters of papers will pay a reduced conference fee.

managers, advisors, EDP auditors, network administrators, and help
desk personnel from government and industry, as well as other
