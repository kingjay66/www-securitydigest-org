VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

If the virus is in an application, the an alert is displayed saying
Disinfectant INIT found a virus and that it should be removed with
Disinfectant.  It will not let the program run.  If the virus is in
the Desktop, a similar alert will be shown, the Finder will run, but
the virus will be "contained," kept from furthering the infection.

This INIT only checks applications when they are run and do not check
documents (i.e. Hypercard stacks).

I agree, such activity is possible which is why I recommend that techs
be properly trained (ours get two full days) before being allowed to
work on suspected viruses. CHKDSK & DEBUG anre powerful tools in
trained hands as are MANIFEST, MEM, & MAPMEM. Scanners are very good
automated tools for problems they hve seen before and can take care of
98% of our problems: the other 2% just have to be handled manually -
see below

NO, NO, a thousand times NO !I have never seen an infection that
requires low level formatting (besides, on some newer disks you can't)
Azusa is one of the easier to remove (believe I posed instructions
some time ago) - certainly easier than the MusicBug which can also be
removed. If the problem is understood, formatting is never necessary.
Azusa can be removed just using debug if you know what you are doing.
Just because one generic tool does not know how to do it does not mean
it cannot be done.

Subject: Possible Virus? (PC)

I have a Packard Bell 286 with the following problem:

Every once in a while (50-300 characters typed) a character typed at
the keyboard doesn't seem to *make-it* to the PC, and instead produces
an audible beep.  In addition, the keyboard occasionally shifts into a
mode where the SHIFT key is being held down, (types !@# instead of
123), but the shift key has not been hit, so is not physically
sticking.

Packard Bell Technical Support has been unable to fix the problem.
They have replaced three keyboards, two motherboards, and one power
supply in their *troubleshooting* efforts.  With all this hardware
replaced, I suspect a possible virus, but Scan V77 shows no viruses
found.

If anyone has any ideas as to how to fix this annoying problem, please
E-mail me your suggestions/ideas.

Thanks in advance,

A low-level format is certainly not the *only* way to fix an
Azusa-infected hard disk.  Any program that can write a valid boot
record to the partition-table area (preserving the partition
information and just fixing the code) will remove the virus from the
execution stream, and (since the Azusa uses only the partition table
area on a hard disk, and no sectors in the DOS partition or anywhere
else) that will disinfect the disk very nicely...  DC

Subject: Dave Barry's definition of a computer virus

Dave Barry's column in the Sunday Washington Post, "Our Friend the
Computer", has the following defintion of a computer virus:

     "...You have probably read about computer viruses, which
      computers get when they're left uncovered in drafty rooms.
      This is bad, because if you're working on an infected
      computer, it will periodically emit electronic sneezes
      (unfortunately not detectable with the naked eye) and
      you'll be showered with billions of tiny invisible pieces
      of electronic phlegm, called "bytes", which penetrate into
      your brain and gradually make you stupid..."

I noticed this 654336 anomaly as well.  Unfortunately (fortunately?)
SCAN V7.2V77 didn't find a culprit, and Norton utilities came up blank
when I searched for "Stoned".  I'll spare you the details of the painful
steps taken to arrive at my solution to say that:

    Some PC/AT computers give the user an option to place 1K of BIOS
    into base memory subsequently reducing the size of memory to:

    (you guessed it)  654336

You may want to look for this option BEFORE you format your disks :)

Good Luck

Subject: Re: Hypercard Antiviral Script? (Mac)

Your best defense is locking your home stack, or constantly searching
your home stack for script modifications.

You can try editing the script of a stack before opening it, but the
virus might be in any object in the new stack.

Even though you can check the params of a set command for the word
"script", no unlocked stack will be safe until Apple prevents using
the set command in a end to HyperCard

I'd elaborate, but wouldn't feel right about explaining how to commit
sabotage.

   		Yaunch (alias 'Wench')
		Yukon (overwriting)
		ZK-900

	Disinfection of the following viruses, which were detected in
	earlier versions:

		Faust (alias Chaos) (previously called 'Spyer')
		Form

	The following names have been changed, in an attempt to reduce
	the incredible confusion in the virus naming area.

		1075 --> DBF blank
		June 4th --> Bloody!
                Spyer --> Faust
		Turku --> Keypress

	The following bugs/problems have been fixed:

		The signature for the 1049 virus has been changed, as it
		could cause false alarm in the 386COM.SYS file.

		F-FCHK would not detect all the possible mutations of
		the Whale virus in .COM files, although all infected
		.EXE files were found.  This has been corrected.

		Occasional very long delays when some programs, such as
		SORT.EXE in DOS 4.0 were run have been eliminated.

		F-OSCHK will now correctly handle the case where a
		checksum evaluates to 0, as 0 previously meant "ignore".
		Instead the string ----- is now used when a checksum
		should be ignored.

		When F-DRIVER and F-NET were in use, Novell "execute-only"
		programs could sometimes not be executed.  This has
		been corrected.

		F-DRIVER would on some computers fail to detect some boot
		sector viruses if it was loaded into high memory (above
		640K.  This has been corrected - LOADHI etc should now
		work without problems.

        F-FCHK will now indicate if a program has been compressed by
        DIET 1.10, ICE 1.01 or EXEPACK.  This warning only indicates that
	a virus could possibly have been hidden in the program before it
	was packed - not that anything appears to be wrong.

	A new file has been added with information on Trojans and "Joke"
	programs, often found in virus collections.  Those programs are
	not a threat like viruses - but some of my competitors detect
	them, so....

        /QUERY switch added to F-FCHK.  if it is used, F-FCHK will ask if
	it should disinfect any infected files - this used to be the
	default.

	A conflict has been reported between F-DRIVER and Desqview, and
	I am trying to determine if a problem exists.

Rosenthal Engineering's VIRSIM program is a string-based virus
simulator.  As such, only scanners that use the same strings that
VIRSIM uses will detect its "viruses."

We regularly adjust our strings, so this why V76 would report viruses
that V77 did not.

 "Can anyone suggest an explanation of our observation on several
 computers (various IBM pc types) of a result from chkdsk of 654336
 bytes of total memory?"

As Rob Slade suggests, one possibility is a virus.  However, a much
more likely possibility is that the computers have extended bios
extended data areas. (See, e.g. "The New Peter Norton Programmer's
Guide to the IBM PC & PS/2",2nd edition, 1988, page 62.)  INT 15H,
AH=C0H will return ES:BX as the segment:offset of a configuration
table.  The fifth byte of this configuration table gives configuration
flags.  Bit 2 of this byte is set if an extended Bios data area is
allocated.  Moreover, INT 15H, AH=C1H will return the segment address
of the base of the extended bios area.  The word at 0040:0013H is
modified to reflect the reduced amount of memory available to
programs.  This is what chkdsk returns as "bytes total memory", and
also what INT 12H returns in AX.  On my COMPAQ 386/20e at work, I
obtain the following when I use DEBUG:

- -a100
1AFA:0100 mov ah,c0
1AFA:0102 int 15
1AFA:0104
- -g104

AX=0000  BX=E6F5  CX=0000  DX=0000  SP=FFEE  BP=0000  SI=0000  DI=0000
DS=1AFA  ES=F000  SS=1AFA  CS=1AFA  IP=0104   NV UP EI PL ZR NA PE NC
1AFA:0104 0000          ADD     [BX+SI],AL                         DS:E6F5=6E
- -df000:e6f5 l 9
F000:E6F0                 08 00 FC-01 00 74 00 00 00              .....t...

The configuration flag byte is 74H=01110100B, and since bit 2 is set, my
machine has an extended bios data area allocated.

Moreover, using DEBUG again, this time for INT 15H, AH=C1H, I obtain:

- -a100
1C6B:0100 mov ah,c1
1C6B:0102 int 15
1C6B:0104
- -g104

AX=C100  BX=0000  CX=0000  DX=0000  SP=FFEE  BP=0000  SI=0000  DI=0000
DS=1C6B  ES=9FC0  SS=1C6B  CS=1C6B  IP=0104   NV UP DI NG NZ AC PO NC
1C6B:0104 7205          JB      010B
- -d9fc0:0
9FC0:0000  01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00-00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................
etc., all following bytes being zero.

My machine has 1Kb of memory reserved, at the top of memory for an extended
bios data area.  The first byte gives the number of Kb of memory reserved.
On my machine all the other bytes are zero, whenever I look at them
with DEBUG.  (I don't know what they are when I don't look at them.)
For what it is worth, the machines at work which have the extended bios
data area implemented, and for which chkdsk returns 639K total memory,
all have a socket in the back for a bus mouse.

Subject: Re: Hypercard Antiviral Script? (Mac)

I said I was going to rewrite my scripts to handle new trojans/viri,
however I am trying to consider some options.

The main problem is that there is no way to catch the parameters of
the SET function in HC 2.1.  So, while I play with different virus
scenarios (i.e.  writing ones that I think will do certain things,
using certain HC resources, I want to try and find some common link
between them.  The answer, then, will be unable to intercept and stop
infection, but will have to work beforehand.

The problem with this is that a field of all stacks that have been
checked needs to be kept, and everytime that a stack is opened, the
field must be examined to see if this particular stack has been
checked.  However, the problem with that is that existing checked
stacks may have been infected and will thus escape detection.  So,
while my solution appears to be the simplest (i.e. check all stacks to
begin with then keep a running list), the time spent by the user seems
to be very long.  So, the story on this is: unless there seems to be
some need/desire emerge for a new stack/utility to do this work, I'm
moving slowly.  As I said before, if anyone else feels like beating me
to the punch with a solution of their own, feel free - but don't you
DARE charge $$ for it.

Subject: Ws and Ps now you see em.... (PC)

The following problem has occurred on our network over the past two days:

On Monday, a user showed us two printouts from WordPerfect 5.1
(Network version) printed from the same document about 5 minutes
apart.  She swears she made no changes to the document between the two
printouts.

On one printout all the Bitstream Dutch 11 point (we use Bitstream
fonts on HP Laserjet II printers) 'w's (upper and lower case) were
missing (i.e.  replaced by relatively narrow blank spaces).  On the
2nd printout, the 'w's were all there.  At the top of the document, a
large capital W using a different font appeared in both printouts.  It
is a one-page document.

Today the same sort of thing happened to another user on a different
PC using Lotus 2.01 networker.  This time the 'p's were missing from
one printout but not another of the same spreadsheet.

We are using Novell Netware 2.15C on an internet with a 3.1 server.
These incidents happened to people who were using the 2.15C to store
their data files and the application software.

We are using Printer Assist from Fresh Technologies to print to the
laser printers.  The two incidents involved different printer servers
and printers as well as different PCs.  Both PCs used DOS 3.3

I scanned the network and both PCs involved using McAfee's SCAN
version 77 but turned up no indication of any virus infection.

To the best of my knowledge, this is the first time anything like this
has happened on our network.

No, I am not sure this is a virus, but it seems the kind of thing that
malicious code might do.  If anyone has any ideas as to what may be
going on here, I would be grateful to hear them.
