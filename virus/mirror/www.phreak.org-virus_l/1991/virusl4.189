VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

The problem is guaranteeing that the program which is saying "I'm
going to mess with your data now" is really the maintenance program
and not something that will kill every machine on the LAN.
Most users will just say "OK" if the prompt to "fix" things looks OK.
How else do they check it?

Subject: Norton Antivirus 1.5 + 707 virus (PC)

I downloaded the latest Norton Antivirus 1.5 virus definitions from
Symantec Australia today.  They definition was dated 10-10-91
(15all04.def).

Anyway it gave me a warning while loading the new definitions that the
definitions for 707 (virus) requires Norton Antivirus version 1.5.3.

The same message was given for the Sentinel virus.

When I went to scan the hard disk after running this installation I
found that I had the "Z, Zero" viruses in memory and that I had the
707 virus when NAV began scanning the files.

When I go and install the original NAV 1.5 disks I have no problems.
I also have no problems using 15all04.def definition file.

What I want to know, seeing that I am in Australia, what the latest
version of Norton Antivirus is and if anyone else has had any problems
installing the definition file "15all04.def".

P.S.  I ran scanv82 from McAffee and this didn't report any viruses.

Also what is this 707 virus NAV has created a definition for.  Scanv82
doesn't scan for this under that name.

I would really appreciate and comments as I don't know if I am getting
a false alarm from NAV due to an old version or if I really do have a
memory resident virus on my computer.

We have find a new Virus. The message given is 'Don't Panic' given by
virus-check 1.2. We don't remember to have neither install this init.
(We use SAM Intercept).  The virus is on an internal hard disk and
it's now impossible to boot the Mac from a protected/not protected
floppy or external hard disk.

If someone know something about this, please help us.
Thanks in advance

No, not at all. Since each time a "specific" virus ran up againast one
of the other approaches, it would be detected, possibly as "DiskSecure
Specific Attack Attempt" by NAV. Given that ALL approaches are in the
minority, such a specific virus would not spread very far. Only a virus
able to attack a significant number of the different systems would have
a chance in the Macro (and why I prefer a layered defense). Given an
installation/network using a single approach, something targetting THAT
installation would be possible (and we have seen a few of these), but again
would probably not spread very far and would be almost certainly an
"inside" job.

Major disagreement. It is easier to protect a single platform with a
"mission-adaptive" approach loaded first than it is to subvert one.
The hard part is making it "user-transparant" unles a valid exception
occurs and permitting the user to make his/her own exceptions when needed.
The only reason that viruses have been so successful is that the
bulk of the 50 (or is it 70) million PCs have NO defenses. Protected PCS
are still in the minority (but increasing).

It sounds to me like a ghosting problem.  I know that if a partition
record is rebuilt by repairing only the executable code of the sector,
leaving "dead" parts of the Empire code in place, then FPROT will see
these and identify the Empire virus as being present.  It seems the
scan string Frisk uses is found in this later part of the virus.
We saw this effect when rebuilding partition records using "Norton
disk doctor".

I suspect that Scan82 simply rebuilds the MBR by rewriting the executable
code into place, leaving the partition table data portion -- and a dead
part of the virus code -- in place.

I hope to check this out when I get in touch with Kees.  (Shouldn't take
long: Elect. Eng. is actually closer than my usual morning coffee stop!)

Joseph:
There will be a new book appearing in the next few weeks that I
believe is just what you are looking for.  It will be published by the
National Computer Security Association and be titled "Computer
Viruses: An Executive's Guide".  Call the NCSA at 717-258-1816 for
more info...

]Fred's Virus-Resistant Machine also had two disk drives, a "program"
]disk and a "data" disk.   It, too, had a _small_ switch (not red),
]labeled: "Install/Run".
]
]  (Notice that unlike Jay's Machine, Fred's machine was not Virus-
] Proof but only Virus-Resistant. Is Fred more modest in his goals
] than Jay...?    He also added some few extra touches that Jay
] didn't think of, and his switch was rather smallish, and not red).
.....
] While sleeping thus, he tried Boot infectors and he tried executable
] infectors. He tried stealth viruses and candid ones, viruses that
] self-encrypt and mutate and he tried others that do none of those
] things.  He even intentionally allowed viruses on the `program'
] disk, but kept the little switch in its safe position.  He had TSR
] viruses, and transient viruses, big ones, little ones, American,
] Israeli and Bulgarian, "wild" and "research" viruses, smart and
] dumb ones... he tried them all.
]
] In this way, while Jay decided that his machine couldn't possibly
] work, Fred discovered that his machine (which wasn't virus-proof,
] but only virus-resistant)  *did* work, and extremely well. None of
] his favorite viruses (hundreds of them, my goodness!) succeeded in
] infecting it.

In other words, you built one computer and ran viruses designed for a
completely different computer.  If Fred Waller's Virus-Resistant machine
became widely available, all viruses that infect .COM, .EXE, etc files
would become obsolete, granted.  But about six months after we all
upgraded to the protected-disk scheme we'd start seeing the spreadsheet
/ .BAT / terminal viruses...

]While viruses are programs they do things that programs should not do
]except in special (and trackable) cases: one of these is to attempt to
]write to executable programs, another is to go resident (at least
]sucessful viruses do).  Both of these are detectable and flaggable.
](The flagging is where many early programs failed since it was not
]selective. BYPASS makes it selective.)

A "new" virus would write to a shell / macro / etc. data file, and would
execute from within some third-party software other than the operating
system.

Hardware is a help, but not the answer.  I don't think there is an
answer.  Follow mom's advice::  "Just be careful out there."

Subject: Re: Books on viruses?

To get an overview of computer viruses and related beasties, the two
best books are without doubt:

"Computers Under Attack: Intruders, Worms, and Viruses" edited by
Peter J. Denning and published by ACM Press/Addison-Wesley (1990)

"Rogue Programs: Viruses, Worms, and Trojan Horses" edited by Lance
Hoffman and published by Van Nostrand Reinhold (1990).

Both books present material from many different sources, covering a
full range of theory, practice, law, defenses, etc.  They are also
significant because they look at a somewhat broader perspective than
just viruses, and neither editor is involved in the sale or marketing
of antivirus technology or classes.  Both are scholarly compilations.

Logically, isn't DIR 2 a "Dynamically linked library"?  Hmmm: what to
use as a biological analogy?  Maybe DIR 2 should be called a
"computer fungus".  :)   Actually my biologist friends get upset
as it is, with our use of "virus" to refer to computer code!

Even easier (and possibly more dangerous) would be a virus written in
DBASE.  A virus which spread through program files (which would have
to be on the data disk unless you want a static system) could
devastate _all_ your DBASE files (on the data disk), since you have an
extraordinary amount of control over your environment from within the
DBASE programming language.

If Fred Waller believes this could not happen, or that it could happen
but not spread, or that it could spread but not be destructive, he
should e-mail me for further details.
