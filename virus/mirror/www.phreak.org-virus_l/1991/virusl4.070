VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: Initial Virus Protection (PC)

We've just identified the stoned virus on our campus. We would like to
get some virus protection out to the pc's asap. We are looking at
FPROT and McAfee's SCAN & CLEAN. There are about 1000 pc's on campus,
almost all stand-alone pc's. Currently, no protection software is in
use on the pc's at this time. Right now, cost is a real factor due to
a limited budget.

Since the virus was found on several write protected floppies used on
drives with good write protection circuitry, we suspect the virus
might have been planted intentionally. With that in mind and the
thought that a nastier virus might be waiting on a disk somewhere,
does anyone have recommendations as to how to initiate some sort of
protection and what software to use?

I get the impression that the only way to be sure we don't have a
virus is to periodically scan our disks with the latest scanning
software we can find. Is this true? Is there some software that can
"guard the front door" to stop a virus from getting on a disk rather
than "constantly checking the house" to see if a disk is already
infected.

Thanks in Advance.

It seems to me that the effects can't be attributed to WDEF since nVIR
was also on the infected drives.  It has been my experience that
although WDEF gets around quickly, that it is not much of a problem
with the older machines.  On the other hand, nVIR (which has made its
rounds here) is more of a pain and interferes with proper oiperation
much more often than WDEF.

Also, benign doesn't neccessarily mean that it doesn't cause any
problems; it just means that it doesn't go out looking for trouble.
Think of a benign brain tumor; it doesn't eat up brain tissue, but it
does start putting pressure on the brain when it grows, eventually
destroying the tissue.  Pretty yummy analogy, huh? =-)

Subject: TSR Virus Detector (PC)

Hi.  I'm sure that this question has been asked here before, but I'll
ask it again:

Can anyone reading this recommend a reliable program that will sit in
memory and warn against writes to .EXE and .COM files, as well as
other suspicious virus-like activity without degrading performance of
the machine too much?  Are there products like this that you've had
bad experiences with?

And while I'm posting this, I'll comment that it would be a GOOD THING
if someone from IBM who reads this, and is affiliated with VIRSCAN,
could announce new releases of this program on VIRUS-L.  Such
notification would help me out a lot, as our IBM rep is usually
ignorant about it.  AND it would help avoid the kind of rumor
flurrying that surrounded the last release.

Thanks,

Both these options require modification to the PC. This may mean
problems when it comes to getting your machines serviced, or when you
want to sell them. Try explaining to the repair-shop or maintenance
engineer the modifications you have made, then see him go pale as he
wonders if these modifications are the reason for the fault.....

A far easier way is what i have done; you can buy floppy-drive locks
that simply fit into the drive slot and prevents anyone putting any
diskettes in the slot. All you need to remove the thing (when you
*need* to boot from or read a floppy) is a twist of the key.  You
could give 'trusted' users a copy of the key to their PC.

These things are also far cheaper than any hardware/BIOS mods. are
likely to be.

Question is, what are your users going to be better at? Hardware
hacking, or lock-picking......?

Subject: Viruses & System 7.0 (Mac)

The report on GateKeeper 1.2 made me start wondering about how viruses
would behave under System 7.0 (one of the feature points said that
GK1.2 had better compatibility with Sys7, adding that users & viruses
shouldn't notice any differences). Has anyone experienced a virus
under System 7.0 (beta, FC, etc.), and if so, did they behave any
differently. Are any of them completely incompatible in that they
simply crash the machine when they try to do their dirty work, or do
they work just as they always have. Anyone looked at the code enough
even to tell what they'd do?

Of course, compatibility of old viruses aside, I get this gut feeling
that Sys7 will open the doors for more viruses, and make old ones
spread more easily. How will SAM react to an infected file run from a
FileShare folder? Or if someone puts a disk with WDEF into a drive
while a shared folder is open. Will SAM or any of the other active
detectors warn you when a virus tries to get in from the back door?
Does the AppleEvent manager have any built-in precautions to prevent
viri from sending events out to programs? Or from interfering with VM?
I know, lots of questions. Maybe they've been discussed before, I
don't know -- just signed on a week or so ago. As semi-official
manager of a small (~20) network, and someone who has had to clean
Scores, nVir, & WDEF from most of them many times, I'm curious how
much more trouble to expect from System 7.0

I'm sorry if this question seems a bit naive, but why are people so
concerned about the risk of virus-infected self-extracting archive
files?

Can't you just first run the archive file through your favourite virus
checker, and if it passes the test extract it, and then test the
individual files that were inside it? Or have I missed something?

Add Zenith models 150/151 to that list.  SCANs of diskettes that are
known to be infected with Stoned have not been detected on these
machines.  However, F-PROT picks them up.  We have a 151 that recently
had its hard drive trashed due to Stoned.  Had been using VSHIELD and
SCAN (first ver64, then 76, 76C).  ???

|
|  Don't think this would work since all that is required to boot is for the
|  disk to be read. I do not think a switch could prevent selective reads witho
ut
|  disbling any read. (unless you have a use for a write-only floppy).

  All you need is a switch the BIOS can read to disable trying the
boot on A:.

I mailed this to the original poster, but here's my idea. I suggested
it to a vendor, but they haven't used it, or at least not yet.

Have in the CMOS a "boot path" which works like the PATH variable, and
specifies which devices are to be tried, in what order. This allows
disable of floppy boot, as well as boot from B: if A: fails or if you
have one 5-1/4 and one 3-1/2, etc.

Use a password to allow access to change the configuration. If the
password takes too much room, save three bytes of CRC20 plus a value
for length range 1-15 characters. Length zero could mean "no
password."

Sorry for the cross-posting, but...

There is a worm loose on bitnet.  I've gotten hit by 3 copies so far,
all coming out of PSUVM.  I have not determined the origin node yet.

The important characteristics:

Name:   ZT EXEC
Language: Rexx
Size:  68 lines.

It sends a copy of itself to everybody in your NAMES file, using
rather poor parsing, and the PUNCH command rather than SENDFILE.  The
inducement to run it is that it claims to be a 'zebra tell', sending
multi-color messages (actually does 3270 extended attribute chars for
bright/normal).

I suggest that the core nodes put it in their filters.

I've been following this thread from the beginning, and I actually don't
have anything to add. Just wish to point out that REAL programmers,
APPLICATION programmers, have a huge responsibility for system security.

Somebody mentioned MS Word as an example of a program which overwrites its
own code occasionally. Your mistake, I say. Don't buy a word processor from
the company which produced the insecure operating system we're talking about
if you're concerned about viruses and security in general. ;-)

LAN operators should be particularly picky about the programs they choose to
offer the users. If a program can't behave, scratch it! There are going to
be virus attacks on any LAN at one time or another, so be prepared.
