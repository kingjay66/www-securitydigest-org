I agree - the disk caches need to be flushed properly.  Since common Mac
viruses take control at or soon after an application is launched, and can
infect stuff run again at startup, powering down between applications is not
generally a useful strategy for day-to-day use.

You seem to be assuming a connection between facts not causally related:

   1 - Desktop file viruses do not spread easily under system 7, because
       the Finder is more careful about how it opens the Desktop file.
       (This may be related to the use of the Desktop database except on
        floppies or to the Finder rewrite in C++, I don't know.  This
        *could* be Apple getting smart.)

   2 - Disinfectant 2.5.1 cannot repair some files under 6.0.x
       Multifinder/Finder or System 7 Finder, because the files are
       "busy" i.e. already open.
       (This is not an insurmountable problem, because AppleEvents
        could be used to make the Finder quit, and re-launch.  But this
        feature is not in 2.5.1)

   3 - It is *not* safe to assume that because Disinfectant cannot
       repair a file that the file cannot be infected in the first place.
       A virus could infect from an INIT running before the Finder was
       launched, from booting from a floppy or various other ways.
       Disinfectant "plays by the rules" more than viruses - the
       scanning and repair runs as a regular application. Viruses
       are executed by several means, each with its own limitations.

       This is not based on a detailed study of viruses under system 7,
       but on general considerations - and a healthy dose of paranoia.

Subject: Do I have a virus or a hardware fault (PC)

I'm having a problem with a CCS brand XT. This uses a clone motherboard,
that features a VLSI chip that I assume handles the timer / dmi
functions etc.
The problem is that the machine is going into 'error' mode every 9 - 10
minutes. Error mode either results in the machine locking up or if I am
at the dos prompt , a string of ^ (as in the character above the 6) get
printed at the prompt, and the machine is still accessible.
Initially I considered this may have been a hardware problem associated
with the VLSI chip. But I found that when I disconnected the hard disk
and booted of a FDD, the fault did not occur. But if I leave the HDD
connected but still boot of the FDD the fault occurs. I wondered if
there may have been a virus in the partition table. I have scanned with
two virus checkers both found nothing. (But they are both slightly old).
So I then did a low level format on the hard disk, and reloaded
dos(4.01). I did turn the machine off between LLF and reload.
I had also tried disconnecting the keyboard, but the string of ^^^ still
happened. The number of ^ printed is not always the same.
I have also tried removing the multifunction card (which has the real
time clock), but the fault still occurred.
So do you think it is hardware related, or do I have a particularly
persitent virus.
Oh yes, one other thing, the size of the command.com file in the root
directory was correct, but a copy of the command.com in the dos subdir
was different. The system used the \dos copy. But even when i replace
this still no good.
Thanks for any help...

The word "[Cascade]" in the SI report has nothing to do with the
Cascade virus.  It refers to a method (on ATs and higher models) by
which additional levels of external hardware interrupts are obtained
by "cascading" 8259A Programmable Interrupt Controllers, i.e. by
connecting the INT line of the new ("slave") PIC to the IRQ2 line of
the existing ("master") PIC.  Thus the above report is perfectly
normal and has nothing to do with a virus.

Subject: "Stealth" Viruses (4096 in particular) (PC)

     I've been doing some research into computer viruses for my
philosophy class, and I've been rather intrigued by some of the
so-called "stealth" viruses.  In particular, I have a couple of
questions about the 4096 virus (aliases: Century Virus, FroDo, IDF
Virus, Stealth Virus, 100 Years Virus).  It is supposed to be able to
find the original interrupt vector addresses for both the 13h and 21h
interrupts, thus bypassing all active detectors that trap these
interrupts.  I have gone through several technical references, but
have been unable to find where in BIOS or DOS it located this
information.  I assume it must be in one of the several tables of
information in memory that are initialized at boot-time, but I cannot
seem to locate it.  I would prefer responses by e-mail, considering
the volume of posts to this group.  Thanx.

   ....
Type:  Resident COM/EXE-files

   ....
The effects of Liberty are not fully known yet.

Four days ago I'd received a sample of the Liberty (Liberty-C according to
Patricia Hoffman) virus from my E-mail pen-pal from South Africa. I'd
disassembled and examined the virus.

The first and the main feature missed in the above descriptions is that the
Liberty virus infects not only COM/EXE files but a BOOT sector of floppies
as well. However, a floppy infection occurs rather rare and is possible
on PC XTs only. When an infecting of a file fails due to a lack of free disk
space  - INT 21H/AH=40H returns with Carry flag clear but the number of bytes
actually written is less then required (AX<CX) - the virus intercepts INT 13H.
First time a floppy (either A: or B:) is accessed for read or write the
virus reads a Boot sector and if it is not infected attempts to infect it.
To infect a floppy the virus formats an additional (for 360Kb floppies) track
(28H - 40D) with unusual sectors numbers - first 8 sectors used to keep the
virus body have numbers 31H-38H and the last sector (to keep uninfected Boot)
 - 3FH. This won't work on PC AT - some additional efforts are required for
these machines. Floppy infections are made one-at-a-time - regardless was it
successful or failed the virus restores the previous contents of INT 13H
vector and continues to infect files only until the next write error.

When booted from an infected floppy the virus decreases the amount of
memory available (loc. 0:413H) by 10Kb, reads the whole virus to new location
(from head 0, cyl. 28H, sectors 31H - 38H) and  reads an original Boot sector
(from head 0, cyl. 28H, sector 3FH) to 0:7C00H. After 10th bootstrap from an
infected floppy the virus will disinfect itself restoring an uninfected
Boot sector with a byte 0FFH placed at offs. 2 (normally there resides 90H -
NOP). When an infecting routine of the virus encounters such a cured floppy
the virus begins to damage floppies instead of infecting them.

If a bootstrap counter is less then 10 the virus intercepts INT 13H, INT 08H
(Timer), INT 10H (Video Service), INT 14H (Serial port I/O), INT 17H (Printer)
and INT 1CH (Secondary Timer interrupt).

INT 13H is used to infect floppies. The handler installed at boot time is
different from the one used when loaded from an infected file. This handler
is permanent and infects floppies being accessed for Write or Verify (INT 13H,
AH=3 or AH=4).

Hardware timer interrupt (INT 08H) is used to intercept INT 21H after DOS
activating. From inside INT 21H handler the virus infects COM and EXE files
being executed (INT 21H/AX=4B00H).

INT 1CH is used to trigger the virus in certain periods of time. When
triggered, the virus changes all characters being sent/received via INT 14H,
printed via INT 17H and displayed via INT 10H (AH=09 or AH=0AH) to make a
string 'MAGIC!!' for 512 timer ticks (appr. 28 seconds). After 10th triggering
the virus swaps the upper line of a screen for blinking yellow-on-red sign
 'M A G I C  ! ! !' (won't work on monochromes) and then passes control to
ROM Basic (INT 18H). PCs without ROM Basic will either "hang" or reboot.

As I've said above an infection of a Boot sector with the Liberty virus
is rather rare and is possible only on PC XT. Nevertheless since the virus
is common (see VSUM) in the West (it is unknown in the USSR) and there are
still a lot of PC XTs in use Boot sector infections with the Liberty virus
are quiet possible. After 10th bootstrap from an infected floppy the virus
will cure it but such a cured floppy will become a trigger for the virus's
destructive function.

All scanners I've tested (SCAN84, F-PROT 2.01, VIRx 1.8, etc.) found the
Liberty virus in infected files. But *NONE* of them reported an infection
when tested against an infected floppy.

A couple of words more about self-encrypting (see VSUM). The Liberty virus
keeps self-encrypted only a small piece of its code used to infect COM files.
This causes no difficulties in detecting/disinfecting of Liberty. The virus
also keeps encrypted first 120 bytes of an infected COM file but this is NOT
SELF-encrypting.

That [Cascade] is not the Cascade virus, rather it is refers to the
hardware interrupt cascade.  The interrupt controller chip (PIC) can
only support 8 IRQs, so starting with the PC/AT IBM put in 2 of these
chips and cascaded all interrupts from the second to IRQ 2 on the
first.  That way you now have 15 IRQ lines and old PC/XT programs
still work, thinking there are only 8 IRQ lines.

How can it be that in these two cases a Quick scan detected something,
a Secure scan missed? Before that test, I was under the impression
that a Secure scan will never find less viruses or variants than a
Quick scan.

Does this result mean that we will have to run both scans to be on the
safe side?

This is not necessarily a new strain.

The (ordinary) Stoned virus infects only diskettes in drive A. As the
infection always comes from the same drive A (by accidently booting
from an infected diskette), this virus will stick to one sort of
diskettes, under normal circumstances. However, it can equally spread
in an 5.25" or in an 3.5" environment. Hence, to the (ordinary) Stoned
virus, the MS-DOS world consists of two mutually exclusive populations
of PC, viz.  those with 3.5" drives as A, and those with 5.25" drives
as A.

In rare cases, a copy of the virus may make it to the other sort of
diskettes, e.g. after re-configuring a PCwith an infected hard disk
(making A a drive of the other sort), or after mounting an infected hard
disk into another PC with different diskette drive A. This copy will
subsequently spread in the other part of the PC population.

Of course, a Stoned virus could be modified to infect B drives, as well;
this variant could easily propagate to the other sort of diskettes, as
many PCs are equipped with two different dikette drives. I do not know,
whether such a variant exists, however.

	I now have a second identification of DIR-II from Skulason's

	Discovery of the infection was accidental, the result of a
scan out of idle curiosity. The virus was removed by McAfee  clean
7.9v84. The only snag was that McAfee CLEAN was unable to remove the
virus when executed from a  boot disk. It was necessary to copy CLEAN
to the (infected) hard disk first. Beyond that, everything went
smoothly.  The  affected lab is  back to normal, but is now protected
by McAfee VSHIELD.

	F-PROT's TSR,  VIRSTOP was  also effective in detecting the

one of these programs was not installed before the virus arrived.

Well I do not know about Multifinder under sys 7 but under 6.8 running
AUX in which multifinder is always running the desktop and the system
have been infected and Disenfectent cannot remove it, it must be

I don't suppose this is something we can achieve agreement on since it
has little to do with facts.  Anyway, I do not agree that a program
should be ignored simply because it was written by a known virus
author.  I suspect that quite a few anti-viral people have written at
least one virus for test purposes.  Should we ignore their software
too?

  I suppose, however, that you meant people who have released viruses
publicly, not just for test purposes.  True, Washburn released a virus
publicly, but many of us distinguish between writers of deliberately
destructive viruses and those of non-destructive ones.  And Mark's vi-
ruses are not destructive. True, someone else used his virus to create
a destructive one, and mainly because of the possibility that this
would happen, Washburn's decision was a mistake.  But perhaps he has
realized his mistake?

  And even if he has not repented, I'm not sure the public should be
deprived of knowledge of a good product because of this.  As you will
no doubt recall, several months ago (long before Fred Waller appeared
on the scene), I expressed the opinion in Virus-L that SECURE was the
best generic monitoring program I had seen, at least from the point of
view of minimizing false negatives (and perhaps false positives too,
though it leaves something to be desired from the user interface as-
pect).  So why should the program be ignored?  Just to get revenge on
Washburn?

  Well, as I said, this has little to do with facts, so I suppose
neither of us will convince the other.  Still, I thought it would be a
good idea to point out that other opinions are possible on this issue.
