VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: Invalid Media Type (Virus attack?) (PC)

In the last 3 weeks, my hard drive has crashed 4 times.  This is what
happens:

I boot up, and it locks up.  Then I boot from floppy, and get to the
dos prompt.  When I try to get a directory of C: I get the message
'Invalid media type' ...

Luckily, I use MS-DOS 5.0, and use the MIRROR command in my
autoexec.bat so I FORMAT drive C: and then UNFORMAT drive C:, and then
most (but not all) of my data is recovered.  I brought the cpu to the
manufacturer and he tested the hard drive, and said there were no
defects.  Could this be a virus?  I run McAffee's virus checker daily,
not to mention whenever I unzip a file I get from a BBS.  I never
found a virus!  Could it be a new (or undetectable) virus?  Has this
happened to anyone else before?  It's really a pain in the butt to
have to go through this format/unformat (and lose data) process over
once a week!  Any suggestions?

Thanks.

Sorry but You're wrong! Thunderbyte works real great with
IDE/SCSI/ESDI drives. You just plug in the card into a free slot, and
forget the cable the card will get the signals from the BUS instead of
via a cable between the controller and the harddisk.

Well, it's not only locking You use it for.  Thunderbyte is an
excellent piece of hardware that checks if files are changed,
modifications of files/boot-sectors are done, if time-stamps are being
changed to an odd value (like 62 in the seconds), if COM/EXE/SYS/OVL
files are renamed to a NON executable extension, if read only
attribute is beeing changed. etc etc.

Since the card do NOT look after specific viruses, it's possible to
detect new unknown viruses with it. For example, I got an example of a
virus which the sender didn't know what it was. I ran the file, and
wops! Thunderbyte said that the file was trying to modifiate the
partition table...  Later on, this virus was named TEQUILA. (This was
before SCAN etc could detect it...)

Thunderbyte also includes a password protection that is pretty good,
You can't bypass the password whitout removing the card from the slot.

 I've written PC Magazine's PCdata data integrity toolkit. It will do
exactly what you want.  It's free and you can download it from
CompuServ Ziffnet UTILFORUM (GO ZNT:UTILFORUM).  It will detect any
virus if you boot from a clean copy of DOS first and allow you to
detect damage and reload your system sectors as well as your files. It
will NOT identify viruses by name, it merely identifies changes and
provides directions for determining if it's a virus.  If you don't
have access to CompuServe send me a formatted disk in a self-addressed
stamped mailer and I'll send you the toolkit and full documentation.

 Yes, yes! Someone noticed! :-) It _is_ unfair, and the viruses will
 complain.  Actually, though, the difference is not "complete", only
 _slight_.  It's slight enough that the OS does not see it, and the
 apps do not see it, but current viruses don't like it!  Isn't that
 amazing?

 That was part of the objective and the confirmation is appreciated.
 But don't forget Boot viruses and the new kind of Cluster viruses
 (DIR II).  Those will become unhappy also. All that talent wasted!

 I'll gladly take my chances then, and so should everyone else. But
 a minor correction: .BATs are executable and would be restricted to
 the program disk.  And so can terminal emulators that I am familiar
 with.  Not that I am particularly worried about .BAT viruses - one
 could READ them with a text viewer!  That would be delightful, maybe
 even instructive.  Wish all viruses were so nice.

 As far as "interpreted" viruses, well, Axel Gutman's posting of 12
 Oct 91  16:42:00 GMT addresses the issue better than anything I
 could have written. Yes, there is some concern. But yes, it would
 be much more difficult to write interpreted viruses as effective
 as the current ones. Maybe impossible.

 Another small correction: Fred Waller's Virus-Resistant machine
 doesn't need to be made widely-available.. it's widely available
 already.  In fact, it is the machine you have now, plus some
 interesting modifications.  Nature is bountiful...      :-)

 It should be interesting to see just how it manages to become a
 "stealth" virus or how competently it would take over and manipulate
 Int 13. (In fact, I've been thinking about letting Matsumoto's
 DIET loose on that data drive.. just to complicate things a
 little... :-)

Hi their:

I seem to be having a little problem with a possible virus. I have ran
SCAN v49, and it came up with no results. I have notices that the
program primarily goes after any executable file; and it seems to
corrupt the file when it is being executed. I have downloaded the
following programs from the local BCS bbs:

        SCAN    v49
        CLEANUP 7.9v84
        FLUSHOT+ v 1.7

I ran SCAN with the disk lock on. When I tried to run the program I could
hear that the disk was being accessed to write on it. FLUSHOT varified this

Hi,

  I just received a new variant of SVC it is labeled SVC 6.0! I also talked
  to Dr. Alan Solomon and he has a SVC 5.0. Both are out in the wild!
  These viruses are quite complicated and use advanced stealth techniques!
  Even more complicated and better than 4096.
  SVC 5.0 is some 3.5k
  SVC 6.0 is 4644 Bytes.
  Thes are the second most complicated viruses next to Whale.
  I am in the progress of analysis.... More will follow.

There are two ShareWare checksumming programs named FICHECK/MFICHECK
that take the extensions of files to check as a command line argument
(wildcards o.k.). The version (4.0) I know of is a bit outdated (see
below) and I don't know if the company still exists.  Here are

Subject: PC hardware vs software

I think we have about beaten this to death theoretically. My opinion
is that software is *enough* even though hardware is *more*. If I buy
a new PC, BIOS boot drive selection will be a requirement but I am not
going to retrofit my older ones.

>Any comments  anyone?

Some good thoughts but believe that there are easier ways (unix for
instance) if you need that level of protection. Personally, IMHO, disk
boot selection in hardware (e.g. Zenith, Compaq, Tandon BIOSes) plus a
good set of software permissions/controls would drop viral spread
below the critical point for MS-DOS machines. If viruses stop
spreading, there would be little incentive for writing them. Safe Hex
does not require absinence, merely prudence.

In 1981, the TI 99/4 was a superior 16 bit system but the lack of
flexibility doomed it in the marketplace and this was before we had an
80,000,000 PC installed base. Considering how well thay were made, it
would not surprise me to see a significant number of 8088 and 80286
machines lasting into the next century. Inertia is inevitable. I also
have not yet seen many millionaire anti-virus vendors yet (if they
are, they hide it well).

For the record, I have helped Hal and Steve with strategic information
but have not had any financial stake or arrangement with them or their
company.

It was a coincidence since Steve had been working on this for quite a
while and the filing data had to do with the lawyers and their
timetable rather than RTM.

Subject: Re: STONED Virus - information please! (PC)

I don't have answers about SCAN, but I can tell you about the Stoned
virus.  It has been a persistent problem on our departmental computers
for about a year.  It propagates via the boot sector of a floppy disk.
If an infected floppy is inserted in the A: drive and the machine
booted, the virus will be transferred to the partition table of the
hard drive EVEN IF THE FLOPPY IS NOT A SYSTEM DISK!  An infected
floppy data disk will transmit the virus despite the fact that you get
a "nonsystem disk or disk err or" message back from the BIOS.  I have
basically thrown out infected floppies whenever I find them rather
than using CLEAN for safety's sake, so I don't know about your
problems with the McAfee program.

Okay, if you know what you're doing you can try this.  You need a copy
of Norton Utilities.  Use the explore disk function to examine
ABSOLUTE sector 1.  You should see the number 55 in the last byte of
the sector if your disk is Stoned.  The virus has copied the partition
information to absolute sector 7.  Using Norton copy ABSOLUTE sector 7
to ABSOLUTE sector 1.  That should solve the problem.

If you've never played around with a low level utility like Norton,
you'd best download a copy of McAfee's Viruscan package.  It's
available by FTP, though I'm not sure where.
