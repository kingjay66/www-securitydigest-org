I had this problem as well.  If you place F-DRIVER.SYS as the FIRST
item in CONFIG.SYS, it won't hand on boot.  I think specifically, in
my case, I had loaded F-DRIVER.SYS *after* my ANSI.SYS clone, and when
I reversed that order, it worked.

I've asked Fridrik about this.  he's looking into it, I think.

Subject: long and technical (PC)

I've been thinking about an interesting Virus Protection programming
problem.  The following discussion is a bit long, and horribly technical. 
I hope it is clearly stated, though.  It should be interesting to some.

Consider the following typical (?) large University problem:

The Setting:
A dozen or more computer "labs", each with as many as several dozen DOS
computers.  Each computer is connected to a (write-protected) file server. 
Each computer has a hard drive as well.  The computers are booted from
their C: drives, then (via device drivers and autoexec.bat) they log onto
the file server.

The Goal:
To provide an automated way of removing main boot record (MBR) viruses from
computers, on boot-up.  This is to avoid the need for on-site, manual
clean-up by a technician.  "Boot ROMS" are too expensive, for underfunded
education institutions.  The solution must be a software one.  The idea is
to AUTOMATICALLY (via software) 1. identify that an infection has occurred,
2. clean the MBR and 3. re-boot clean.  Even if the infection is by a
stealth virus.

The Problem:
MBR-infecting viruses trap the INT 13 vector from the vector table in RAM,
and re-route it through themselves, before anything else is executed.  They
may include Stealth techniques to stop all subsequent efforts to access
"absolute sector one".  After an infected boot-up, then, one cannot simply
write a clean MBR copy back into place and re-boot.

The Current Technology:
Good methods are available to identify that the system has been infected.
Several memory scanners are available to recognize known viruses, while
site specific memory checkers can be written to recognize any "change" to
the system after boot-up.  DiskSecure can recognize that an unexpected
change has occurred, and make the hard drive unusable until the MBR is
manually cleaned, from a clean floppy boot.  None of these, to my
knowledge, can do the cleaning automatically from a stealth-infected
environment.
  
Four Solution Ideas: 
1  (Requires knowing what the correct BIOS INT 13 call address is.)  On
each boot-up, re-write the "correct" INT 13 call into the vector table,
thereby "cutting off" the virus, then copy the clean MBR back into absolute
sector one.  This will not work on most systems, because DOS, device
drivers, and the network software may trap INT 13 as well, between the
execution of the virus and the cleanup program.  To re-install the BIOS INT
13 vector would also cut off these essential parts of the system.

2. (Requires knowing what the correct BIOS INT 13 call address is.) Modify
the MBR code so that it uses the correct INT 13 call to see whether it has
been dislodged from absolute sector one, and if so to rewrite itself to
sector 1, and re-boot.  It should include an integrity check of itself,
before it re-writes itself.  This should work against MBR viruses which
move the "proper" MBR to another hidden sector, on infection, and run it
after they are done running.  It will not work against MBR viruses that
completely replace the MBR code.

3. (Requires knowing what the correct BIOS INT 13 call address is.)  Run a
program from the server, which uses the correct INT 13 call to read whether
the correct MBR has been dislodged from absolute sector one, and if so use
the correct BIOS call to put it back.  Then automatically reboot the
computer.

4. Generic Scanner approach.  For a virus to re-route the INT 13 call, it
must store the correct call address somewhere within itself.  For all known
viruses, then, the location of the "true INT 13 vector" within the virus is
also known.  In theory a memory scanner might be designed not only to
recognize a given infection, but also to 1. check the expected location for
the correct INT 13 pointer, 2. use some logic to decide whether it is in
fact the correct pointer, 3. use that pointer (in the same way the virus
uses it every time the computer does a disk access) to re-install the
correct MBR into absolute sector one, and 4. reboot the computer.

Discussion:
For solutions 1, 2, and 3 the implimentation is dependent on the specific
BIOS chip set.  A more general "setup" program might be designed, if one
had the needed data for each known BIOS set. (This could be an expandable
data table, assumably).  Padgett: might such a feature be incorporated into
the DiskSecure package?

Solution 4 suffers the limitations of all scanner approaches: it only works
for known viruses.  It is succeptible to errors caused by modifications of
those viruses.  As well, it requires a full, up-to-date database of virus
information. (Frisk, McAfee, what do you think?)  I've experimented with
the principle behind solution 4 to remove the Empire virus from a computer,
and it worked well.  But I did no error checking.  With only three
distinct boot sector viruses in my collection, I don't think I can
implement #4, except at an experimental level.

Thoughts, comments anyone?

Subject: Exchanging floppies

I work in a library in which we have been accepting disks from patrons
in exchange for a formatted disk.  They then use those in our CD-ROM
workstations to download.  We re-format the disks we receive to use in
the exchange process.  To date, we have not had any infections
(acording to virscan and f-prot).  My question is this: would we be
better off zapping the disks in the demagnitizer, then formatting?  Or
is it safe to just re-format the disks?  My concern is not only for
our systems, but the potential for speading virii to our patrons.  We
prefer our users don't bring disks from their homes or offices to use
in our workstations for obvious reasons, but I want to make certain we
are being as careful as possible.  I will be working with a task force
on downloading from workstations, report due in September, and I would
like to get a definitive answer (as definitive as you all get!) ASAP
to report to my group.

I certainly don't wish to detract from any of the fine work done by
Fred Cohen, but the above is one of two technical fallacies about his
work that people keep retelling.

The two myths and the corresponding truths:

Myth #1) Fred Cohen coined the term "computer virus" in his PhD
dissertation.

Fact: In his dissertation, Fred credits his advisor, Len Adelman, with
suggesting the term "computer virus" for what Fred was studying.
However, Dr. Adelman was not the first person to use that term.  In
the 1970-1972 time frame, the science fiction author David Gerrold
coined the term for something similar to what we know as a computer
virus.  This was as part of his short stories about the "G.O.D.
machine" collected into the novel "When H.A.R.L.I.E. Was One"
(original version, published in 1972).


Myth #2) Fred Cohen invented the computer virus in 1983.

Fact: A number of independently-developed computer viruses appeared
"in the wild" on Apple II machines in 1981.  Some of these were
harmless experiments that were contained, but a few were malicious and
circulated on bulletin boards.  The "Festering Hate" and "ElkCloner"
viruses were known about that time, but weren't called viruses.

Furthermore, if you believe Ken Thompson about his self-reproducing
compiler patch, described in his Turing Award presentation in 1983,
then he had developed something meeting Cohen's definition of "virus"
prior to Fred...and possibly prior to the other examples.


Basic Fact: Fred Cohen was the first person to formally define and
study the properties of computer viruses.  He did this as his PhD
thesis at USC in 1983.  This was (and is) important, pioneering work.
However, Fred neither invented the computer virus, nor did he coin
that term.

	In order to get updates to Norton's Anti-Virus software (to
detect new viruses), you must register the software and use their
bulletin board to download the new definitions. Now, I would do this
but, it's not my software , it's the university's. I seem to be the
only one concerned with virus attacks on our computers because they
[the admin.]  refuses to register our NAV. I've asked several times to
no avail (I think they lost the registration stuff). Even if I did get
it registered, I think they would 'pitch a bitch' about me making long
distance calls to a BBS.
	Now I'm turning to you, the virus experts. How can I define
viruses for NAV using the info commonly given in this forum (you all
get define new viruses before NAV anyway).

The VSHIELD program has an option to disallow loads of programs that
have not certified by VIRUSCAN with the /CV option.  This is not a
"serious" attempt at access control, but will stop people from running
software who are unfamiliar with the software (and of course, VSHIELD
has to be loaded).

My experience with program packers is that once a program has been
packed, further attempts to pack it will not result in enough of a
saving to make it worthwhile, and the packing program (such as PKLITE
or LZEXE) will refuse to generate a new, longer EXE file. For this
reason, the dual level scanning should be sufficient unless multiple
encrypting has been done maliciously in order to create a trojan horse
that will drop a virus.

I recently had a nasty time with Stoned. In trying to rebuild my
hard-disk by selectively recovering files from a PCTOOLS 5.1

I have recently run across a possible new variant of the Stoned virus
here on the University of Texas Medical Branch campus. The history
behind this statement is the fact the FPROT116 detected the
possibility that the variant existed in the boot sector of a user's
hard disk and was unable to remove it.  Various attempts to infect a
5.25 360K diskette were un-successful. The diskette would have been
sent to Fridrik Skulason for examination. The best I could achieve was
a PBR dump using F-PBR. The dump was sent to Fridrik for disposition.
