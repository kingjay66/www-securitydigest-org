VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,

Try running your CMOS setup program again and look at what it says about
your B: drive.  The fact that FORMAT wanted to format to 1.2 MB suggests
that the CMS says you have a 1.2 MB drive, not a 1.44 MB.  There are
many non-virus ways of corrupting the CMOS information.  The obvious way
is a dead battery, but I've done it simply by turning a machine off and
on quickly, so a power glitch could also do it.

    Quoting the Oct 14, Computerworld, Page 14:  "The U.S. Supreme
Court refuswithout comment to hear Robert T. Morris' appeal last
week, ending a legal journey that began nearly three years ago when
he injected a worm into the Internet network." [...] "according to
Thomas Viles, an attorney at the Silvergate & Good law firm in
Boston." [...] "That affirmation goes against the widely accepted
tenet that an injury can amount to a crime only when deliberately
intended, Viles said.  'The law distinguishes, say, between murder
and manslaughter.  You can't be guilty of murder if a killing was
utterly accidental and unintended.'"

/z/

Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer (my parents are married), but I hope
Mr. Viles goes back and reviews "felony-homicide" before he has to
defend someone who utterly accidentally and unintentionally commits
"manslaughter" while breaking-and-entering.

  Yes, these are different subjects, and if we could design a system
which could never be infected, this would be preferable to detection
after infection.  Unfortunately, it's impossible, at least under ordi-
nary operating conditions (e.g., no permanent hardware protection).
On the other hand, it is possible to *detect* all viruses, and this is
apparently the reason that Dr. Fred Cohen (the someone-you-don't-know)
concentrated on detection rather than prevention.  That is, unlike
prevention, detection can be performed without any Type-II errors
("false negatives").  True, there will still be Type-I errors ("false
positives"), but these can be kept to a reasonably small number.
These goals can be achieved by sounding an alarm when and only when
modifications in files [and other regions containing executable (or
interpretable) code] are detected, assuming that no file was infected
when the files were first examined.  As I understand him, this is to
be implemented by a resident program which checksums each program and
its dependent files just before that program is executed.

  However, there are some points which call for comment:

  1. Looking for modifications is not enough to detect all viruses.
One counter-example is companion viruses.  (There are others.)
However, a good program will be able to deal with such cases.

  2. While I've never tested it, I'm willing to bet that Cohen's own
PC implementation of his ideas, his ASP "integrity shell", would fail
to detect certain additional types of viruses, particularly stealth
viruses which infect the MBR or otherwise gain control before ASP
does.  (This, however, does not mean that his goal cannot be achieved
by a better implementation.)

  3. Cohen claims, without any attempt to justify the claim, that only
cryptographic checksumming is secure enough for modification detection
(for anti-viral purposes).  I disagree.

  4. There's no reason why one cannot combine both detection and pre-
vention.  Cohen does not seem to consider the advantage of this com-
bination.

Subject: Pakistani/Ashar (PC)

One machine in my university (a PS/30 with a Seagate 30 MB. disk) was
infected with the Pakistani Brain/Ashar virus (according to Viruscan 84).
If I run Viruscan from a clean disk it does not detect the virus, but if
I boot from the hard disk, the same program says it is in memory.

I have tried everything: a Sys, running Norton 6.0 Disktool, using DE
for writing a new boot sector from other machine with a similar hard disk,
rewriting the partition table (once again, from a similar disk), etc.

Any help will be greatly appreciated.

I observed similar behavior when I attempted to use ResEdit to examine nVIR
resources on an infected system.  After looking at the virus CODE resources,
I would get errors whenever I tried to write.  Never followed it up, since
there were simple cures for this virus -- mostly educating users to do
something about it.

Definitively yes. I have a program, written by a friend of mine, which
tries to disinfect something he calls "generic Jerusalem variant".
When I tested it on Fu Manchu, it disinfected it successfully,
although the author has never seen this virus. The program called it
Jerusalem-2080.

Well, they are different versions of a main strain, written by one and
the same author. They are also upward compatible. I would say that
they definitively belong to the same virus family, even if they are
not considered as variants of one and the same virus. For instance,
Brain-Ohio-Den Zuk also belong to the same family (althoug they are
definitively -not- one and the same virus or even variants of one and
the same virus).

Maybe the V2Px family should be separated, since it is really too
different from Vienna. The others I consider to belong to one and the
same family.

One and the same family.

There are a few interesting ones, aren't they? BTW, they are not only
from Poland; most of the new ones are from the Soviet Union
(Andrzej?). Which reminds me that the hackers out there are quickly

I don't know, but I definitively have seen disks with the virus body
marked as used in both copies of the FAT. Maybe it happens when DOS
updates the same sector of FAT, where the virus mark resides? Try
creating and deleting a file on an infected system, so that it
occupies the end of the disk (you may temporarily mark almost all free
clusters as bad with Norton Utilities to enforce that).

Maybe this referes to the COMPAQ DOS 3.31 situation that was described

And how about the LIDT (Load Interrupt Description Table) instruction?
It is supposed (to my knowledge) to in protected mode only, but on a
80286 it runs perfectly in real mode. It allows you to swap the whole
interrupt vector table with something totally different, which resides
at a different address. Was this fixed in the 386? The author of the
Vacsina/Yankee Doodle viruses had told me that one of his advance
viruses (TP 50 or 51) uses this trick to avoid monitoring programs on
a 286. Unfortunately, I never got a copy of that virus.

Why not just deny the write access to the executables? Also a good
heuristic is to permit programs to write to the files that they have
created OR to the files that have been stated on the command line as
arguments.

It's enough to forbid the non-executable --> executable extension
renaming.

Also, don't forget about the companion viruses. Or viruses that infect
.OBJ, .LIB, .BAT, .MAC, .INC, .H, .C, .PAS, .MOD, .FOR, .BAS, .PRG, or
whatever else gets interpretted/executed... :-)

This is no problem if you forbid only writing, but allow
reading/creating.

Better implement it as a hardware switch. If it is software (even if
it is protected) either (1) the user will not be able to use it, or
(2) a virus would be able to use it too...

Just replace "read" with "write".

Updating through ROMs has been already discussed here, as far as I
remember... It is a good idea, but most computer manifacturers
consider it as too expensive. Don't forget - a practicable anti-virus
solution should be also marketable...

If the hardware supports memory protection, and if it is used to
implement file-access rights, you can get a pretty secure system.
Something like Unix... Ooops, there are already viruses that spread
under Unix, so it doesn't seem to be -THE- solution. True, they spread
very slow, true, they can be catched much more easily, but
nevertheless they exist and they spread. Indeed, they use a completely
different trick. While Mess-DOS virus rely on the abilities to bypass
its protection (huh? what protection?), the Unix viruses rely on the
fact that Unix users share resources intensively...

I would suggest the COPYing of the files to non-executable extensions
(instead of renaming) and DELeting them afterwards (the ones with
executable extensions, that is). But you are right that since the
renaming cause the directory sector to be read, modified and written
back, this will case the virus to disinfect the entries on-the-fly
when the sector is read, and not to re-infect them (becase the do not
seem to belong to executables any more) when the sector is re-written
to the disk.

Hmm, I didn't notice that... Well, my disinfector will not corrupt
information in this case, but it will report that a mutation of the
virus has been found. It is not very clear how this situation could be
handled - since when the disinfector is run, it is not safe to assume
that the DOS version active in memory is the same that was used to
access the infected disk...

...or when it is not active. For instance, my disinfector is able to
find it in RAM and to deactivate it.

Yes, the algorithm is: start from the last cluster of the disk; if it
is marked as bad, move to the previous one; when you find a non-bad
cluster, move one more cluster backwards if it is a high-capacity
diskette (or, more exactly, if the cluster size is < 2 sectors).

No, because you may find a file that contains the virus, without the
disk being infected - for instance, if someone has copied the file
from and infected disk on a clean system, but has not tried to execute
the file yet. In this case, you should not try to disinfect the media.
Maybe the simple deletion of the file would be appropriate.

Yeah, that's what I mean... My disinfector does not delete such files.
Maybe it should?

Subject: Help please (PC)

   As the subject line suggests I NEED HELP!!!!!

   And, surprise surprise it has to do with viruses (I think...)

   The only clues I have to help with the naming of the virus is that
   when I load WordStar 1512 it sometime crashes and the words
   CRAZY EDDIE
   appear somewhere on the screen.  It does'nt happen all the time
   but it would be nice to find a way to solve the problem.
   I use McAfee Associates SCAN util (version 84) but this does not
   report anything wrong with my hard disk of files.

   Any help would be gratefully received.

       ..... THANKYOU!!!!!
