There are possibly more practical reasons as to why there are more pc viruses
than mac viruses:  There are MORE pcs than macs,  not just more "vandals
writing",  tho the two quantities are clearly related.  I saw a blurb a while
back in PC Week saying there were around 45 million pcs in the US (apparently
not counting Europe and elsewhere).  Unfortunately,  there was not a
corresponding figure for macs.  Be that as it may,  more pcs means more people
working on them (for one reason or another - some to do work, some to write
viruses).  Something else of note that I've learned from this list is that most
recent viruses have been written in (eastern) Europe.  What is the ratio of pcs
to macs in Europe?  Predominance of the platform easily leads to more viruses.
And if it's easier to do on a pc...well,  it's a frightening scenario.

Summary: Reposted by Keith Petersen

I have uploaded to SIMTEL20:

pd1:<msdos.virus>
BOOTCOMP.ZIP    Use BIOS-ints to compare bootsector with saved

This package uses the original BIOS interrupts to get the "current"
bootsector and partitiontable and compare it with a previously saved copy.
Since the original interrupts are used, no virus can mislead the program.

In answer to Fridrik Skulason's request in VIRUS-L last month for a
translation of a sentence appearing on the POLIMER Virus:

A le' jobb kazetta a POLIMER kazetta!  Vegye ezt!

I. Szarka at IBM's Budapest office confirmed to me today that the
sentence is in Magyar.  It translates as:

The best cassette is the POLIMER cassette!  Buy this!

As a systems engineer with our Budapest office, he is very interested in
knowing as much information about this POLIMER virus as possible.  Could
Mr. Skulason please forward details of the POLIMER virus to klub@maristb
on BITNET.  At this time, my IBM account is unfortunately not connected
with any outside networks.

Subject: Is this a virus? (PC)

  I Would like some good advice on VIRUS. I am trying to figure out
whether a computer has a virus or the computer is just sick, here
goes:

      While being inside a word processor (MS-Word 5.0) the computer
suddenly hung up, at least the keyboard was disabled. The speaker
started pipping realy madly. The mouse still worked though.
  If the computer was hung the mouse would not work, if the computer
was hung the speaker would not be beeping, but just make a tone,
Have I got a known Virus on my hand or what?
  Any suggestions are welcomed.

Regarding the subject of automatically detecting infections by boot
sector viruses, I just wanted to point out that F-DRIVER.SYS (a part
of my F-PROT package) will detect all known boot sector viruses, and
is also designed to detect new/unknown boot sector and partition table
viruses.  I will, however include an option in version 1.15 to disable
this check, as it may cause problems on machines with network boot
ROMs.

Subject: Viruses Via Radio

The January 28th edition of Computer World has an article in the
viewpoint section entitled "Fighting Terminal Terroism".  The appears
within:

   Radio frequency interception is a nearly trivial task today.  Using an
   "intercept/transmit" model,  viruses can be injected into communications
   systems with relative ease.  The U.S. government has issued contracts
   for studies on methods of infecting enemy military computers with
   viruses...

I was not aware virus transmission by radio had been accomplished.  I
recall a news blurb a few months or so ago about the contracts for
radio transmission of viruses, but I also vaguely remember that the
general conscensus was that it was not possible ('course, that
wouldn't stop the government! ;).  So, fact or hype?  Anyone have any
information?

However, scanners are only one form of integrity protection for a PC.
A good AI program will be able to "learn" a system configuration,
which programs are allowed to do what, and flag the user if something
unusual takes place. The prime problem with such schemes today result
from too many "false positives" to avoid any "false negatives".
Enigma-Logics VIRUS-SAFE, Certus Int'l's CERTUS, and Mr. McAfee's
VSHIELD are good second generation products available today, but the
third generation is going to have to include some form of AI as
described above.

This certainly is a better answer than exists under DOS alone but
there are methods that can be used to achieve tha same result with
much less effort.

First, the "booting from floppy" requirement was found to be
unacceptable to most users: it was easier to perform the integrity
checking at the BIOS level as suggested and then pass the BIOS "hooks"
in memory. Additional problems are that you will not be notified of an
infection until you run BOOTCOMP after DOS has loaded and each machine
must have its own floppy making maintenance more complicated. Also
this is a difficult proposition when coupled with a "never boot from
floppy" policy or any sort of paswword protection for the hard disk.

The real point is not the difficulty of writing the application,
either is simple in comparison to writing a good word processor,
rather it is the total lack of integrity checking in either platform.
Larger systems were forced to design in such systems (and accept the
impact on performance) so that accidental (or malicious) actions by
one user could not take down an entire system. IBM learned this in the
'50s as has every other multi-user system manufacturer, but the
original 4.77 mHz PC could not compete with the CP/M machines if the
overhead of a "real" OS was added. MACs are the same way - performance
takes precidence over protection. This is neither good nor bad, just a
fact.

Today with 40 mHz 68040s and 33 mHz 80386s, the performance it there
to allow effective integrity assurance unnoticably (in fact it can be
done on a 4.77 mHz PC), there just has not been much of a market for
it. MS DOS 5.00 does not seem to have any more than 1.00 did and I
would be surprised to find anything in MAC 7. On both platforms, if
you can write a properly constucted executable file, the CPU will
happily execute it even if it causes self-destruction.

Today, what development has been done has largely been by a small
group of dedicated people such as Frisk, Ross Greenberg, Chip Hyde,
Dennis Yelle, Morgan Schweers, Kelly Goen, John Norstad, and Andy
Hopkins (I know this isn't complete) who have taken the time and
trouble to really understand the architecture before making an attempt
at a solution.

As far as viruses are concerned, it is difficult to have twenty years
experience in a field that has only existed for four (Yes, Fred C.
wrote one in 1984 on the VAX but I start PCs with the Brain). From one
standpoint, It is amazing that we have come so far in a short time -
the trouble is that we all want more and know that it can be done.

Hello virus-l,

I just joined the list and I am interested in finding out information
regarding the "Ohio" virus.

I've been told it only hits 360K floppies and it infects the boot sector.

What I would like to know is what the virus does.  Does it destroy data?
Does it destroy FATs? etc...

We have discovered a large number of floppies infected with this virus and
are in the process of cleaning it up.

Please respond directly to me.  I will summarize if appropriate.

Thanks in advance.

Subject: Leprosy virus signature error (PC)

        It has been brought to my attention that the virus signature
in the file VIRUS.NEW on beach.gal.utexas.edu for the Leprosy virus is
in error.  VIRUS.NEW is an addendum to SIGN.TXT used by FPROT114.
Fridrik Skulason has verified that this new signature may cause a
false alarm in some instances. If you have downloaded VIRUS.NEW from
beach.gal.utexas.edu and receive a warning pertaining to the Leprosy
virus it is probably a false alarm. An updated/corrected version of
the file will be available shortly and I will announce it's
availabilty in VIRUS-L.

I would suggest you get a copy of F-PROT from one of the server sites

True. Viruses cannot infect text files, as they are never executed. Viruses
CAN look to see if a certain filetype is being accesses  (i.e.  .DBF),  but
since  there  is no executable code in a text file, there is no way a virus
can "latch" onto the file.
...........
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
There was a long discussion in Virus-L in the past about viruses  infecting
text  files.  Some  systems and programs when reading text files treat some
character sequences as escape sequences to tell them to obey the  following
characters   specially,   e.g.  reading  them  as  binary  into  store,  or
trojanizing keyboard keys by altering what those keys do. So viruses  <can>
infect or trojanize text files.
