Subject: Stoned on a Hardcard (PC)
     
We're currently having a few skirmishes here with the stoned virus.
In one instance we had stoned show up on a hardcard (and removed
same).  Hadn't thot of hardcards being infectable before, but I
suppose it's no different from the flat round kind of hard disk.  Are
there any differences in viral behavior/ detection/removal when a
hardcard is involded (as opposed to a hard disk)?

Hold it right there.  The PS/2 has a 'feature' in that it will ignore
how a diskette is formatted and will ignore the diskette hardware.  If
you format a 1.44M 3-1/2" (I assume you mean 3-1/2") to be 720K (i.e.
use it in your laptop that only has 720K floppy?) and attempt to read
it in the PS/2 it will think it is formatted HD (1.44M) and give up.
Tape up the little square hole on the upper left hand side (no, not
that one under the slide) and try it again.

Subject: Query - Disinfectant vs. Virex (Mac)
     
Virex 1.3 is rather old, and probably won't catch any virus except
those older than WDEF, at least (discovered in late 1989).  Virex is
updateable from the company, for a fee; I believe that 2.0 was
released in 1989, though my memory may be playing tricks on me there.
As far as I know, from the standpoint of reliability, both products
are completely reliable.  The only differences visible to the user are
minor cosmetic differences in implementing the interface, the
commercial vs. PD issue, and the cost.  By commercial vs. PD, I mean
to mention that some people would prefer to use a commercial product
that they have to pay to get upgrades for because that prodcut's
creators are more motivated to keep the program up-to-date, and less
likely to drop support.  Personally, I recommend Disinfectant; John
Norstad's done a great job, his updates are usually the first I hear
of the existance of a new Mac virus, and his support for the product
has been wonderful.

Occasionally, I see people asking about such things on this list and
elsewhere, and I am underwhelmed by the amount of information that
therefore appears on the net.
     
Has anyone ever actually SEEN a "virus" on a UNIX box? And, don't tell
me about worms, that's a different matter ... I am specificly looking
for information about programs that propogate by modifying other
programs.
     
My background as an operating systems programmer at Sun leads me to
believe that such virii would be more difficult and less rewarding for
Joe Virus-Writer to create, and easier to protect against using
mechanisms available in the system, but it might be nice if I could
have some backing information that I could give when people ask me
about such things ...

First of all, you should ALWAYS GET THE CURRENT VERSION of any
Antiviral utility.  Using old versions is a ticket to disaster as it
lends a false sense of security.
     
Given the easy availability (Disinfectant is everywhere; and
you can order an upgrade of your current VIREX by calling
1-800-877-CURE) there is no excuse not to be current.
     
The current versions of VIREX and Disinfectant find and remove
all currently known Mac Viruses.  Both have powerful INITs.
     
Starting with V3.0, the VIREX INIT became significantly more
powerful.  The INIT now has repair capabilities (in fact, the
only reason to use the Application is if wierd things start
to happen and you want the App's better reporting.)
     
All the antivirals do a fine job of the basic function of virus
detection and repair; where they are differentiated is in
bells&whistles, nice user interfaces, and support.  When you go with a
commercial product like, oh to pick one at random, VIREX (available at
finer computer stores, as well as a lot of direputable ones...) you
are paying for handholding; there's going to be someone on the other
end of the phone line for you to call when the going gets wierd.

Subject: International Virus Infections (PC)
     
One of my BBS users (David Clarke) reported an interesting virus attack
on board the cruise liner Royal Viking, in Wellington on Sat 19 January.
     
He was called to the ship to diagnose some problems they had been having
with the hardware.
     
The JOSHI virus was discovered on two PS/2 55's running MS-DOS 4.01.
The KEYPRESS virus was found lurking on a Toshiba portable running
MS-DOS 3.3 on a 20MB HD.
     
David writes, "Joshi infected three of my diskettes while I was hunting
for the problem, I've learned my lesson, keep all diskettes write
protected!"
     
As mentioned, the callout was to diagnose hardware problems. What made
it harder to pin down as viruses was neither of these viruses being seen
in New Zealand before (as far as I know).
     
It is interesting to note he had downloaded SCAN and CLEAN from The Cave,
as the computer press and newspapers over here are continually lambasting
bulletin boards as a primary source of infection. Its a good thing some
people know better...

The original posting referred to the fact that the *Stoned-II* virus
had not been seen in the United States.  There have, in fact, been two
*major* variants of Stoned, with *minor* variations of each.  The
Hoffman list describes a total of six variants altogether, and as
those familiar with virus reseaarch will attest, this is probably very
conservative.

Subject: Apathy and viral spread (general)
     
Recently, Stratford Software has started a new online information
service called SUZY.  (The service is active in Canada, and is in
beta testing for users in the United States.)  I manage the data
security/anti-viral topic area (referred to as an "Information
Network", or "IN") called INtegrity.  Any SUZY user can look at
the information in the INs, but, as they "leave" the area, they
are asked if they want to "join".  This simply puts them on a
mailing list that can be used to send announcements to the
"members" of an IN.  If they want to "join", they hit ENTER, if
not, they hit <ESC>.
     
Well, as of today, the number of SUZY users who have joined
INtegrity stands at 170.  Some others may have dropped in and
looked around, but deliberately left themselves off the list when
they left the IN.
     
The number of accounts on SUZY currently stands at about 6000.
However, research I have done indicates that less than 15%
actually use the system more than once a month.  Interestingly,
this figure has remained unchanged since SUZY was released.  That
means that less than 900 accounts are "active".
     
What does this mean to you, and to data security?  It means that
less than 3% of all, and 20% of *active* SUZY users care enough
about data security to join the anti-virus IN.  This is the
*real* reason that computer viri are so widespread today: people
do not realize the danger.
     
Those of you who have studied viral charactersitics, and
virus protection and functions, will realize how easy
it is to protect yourselves against most viri.  But if the
majority of users think they are safe, and do not take *any*
precautions, then viri have a fertile breeding ground to grow and
spread in.  As my wife says, it show not only how few people
understand technology, but how few even understand the concepts
of public health.

               Changes to F-PROT
     
Version 1.14 added the following features:
     
     
        Detection, but not removal of
     
                Anthrax
                Crazy Eddie
                V2P6
     
        The reason V2P6 is not removed is because of the complexity of
        the various encryption methods - If you ever get infected by the
        virus, I suggest you contact its author:

        F-FCHK now does a much better job of identifying minor variants of
        viruses, in particular those cases where the differences are
        insignificant and do not matter with regard to disinfection. As
        an example, it will now identify the minor Jerusalem-variants
        (Payday, Mendoza, A-204, Puerto, Sunday, Anarkia, Westwood, B, C, G
        GrLkDos etc.) correctly, instead of just labeling them "Jerusalem".
     
        The /LIST switch added to F-FCHK, to produce a report with a list
        of files scanned, and results.
     
        The /MULTI switch added to F-FCHK and F-DISING to scan multiple
        diskettes.
     
        The switches may be combined with other switches - for example
        you can use
     
                F-DISINF A: /MULTI /AUTO
     
        if you have a large pile of infected diskettes or
     
                F-FCHK C: /AUTO /LIST > report.lis
     
        to scan and disinfect drive C: and produce a report.
     
        The following bugs/problems have been fixed:
     
                The identification string for "Zero Bug" has been changed
                as it produced a false positive in LB.COM from Lahey and
                several other programs.
     
                F-FCHK now reports the correct number of files disinfected,
                when files are infected with multiple viruses.
     
                Occasional (but very rare) crashes of F-XLOCK and F-FCHK
                if F-LOCK was not installed.
     
                Problems when removing "Stoned" from a hard disk formatted
                under some DOS versions earlier than 3.0
     
                Occasional incorrect removal of Alabama.
     
The following problem-fixes and changes are expected in version 1.15
     
        Detection of Whale is not fully reliable, as I do not yet have
        samples of all the different mutations of the virus.  This is not
        a serious problem, as the virus is not known to exist "in the wild",
        but I am working on this.
     
        F-DRIVER.SYS seems to be disabled on some machines running PC-NFS.
        This was only discovered yesterday, and I am searching for a way to
        solve this.
     
        Automatic scanning of boot sectors will be added in 1.15.

                        Processor-specific viruses
     
When the first viruses appeared, some of them were discovered to work
only on 8088/8086 but not on '286 or '386 computers.  The best example
of this are two early boot-sector viruses:
     
        Ping-Pong (Italian, Bouncing Ball) - the standard version uses
        the MOV CS,AX instruction which only exists on 8088 and 8086.
     
        Alameda (Yale) - The first version used the POP CS instruction,
        for the same purpose - which also generates an "invalid instruction"
        interrupt on later processors.
     
The reason for this was assumed to be that the authors of the viruses
only had access to an 8088/8086 computer.
     
Now we have a different, but equally interesting situation.  One of
the recent viruses from Eastern Europe fails to execute on the 8088
and 8086 processors, but works perfectly on a '386.  The reaon is its
use of the PUSH IMMEDIATE instruction (hex opcode 68), which did not
exixt on the 8088/86.  The author of this otherwise non-remarkable 492
byte virus can therefore safely be assumed to have access to a more
powerful computer than the virus writers two years ago... :-)
