I'd like to solicit your expertise on how best to protect the
following LAN froviruses, etc...  It is a Novell Barcode LAN 3 of the
terminals are accessible by anyone.  The remaining terminals are
located in a secure area.  We'd like to protect the whole LAN,
including the mainframe host.  What type of solution will give us
adequate protection without loss of performance?

Ah, here is your problem, using the params with set doesn't work.  In
fact, if you check "the paramCount" for set you'll find out that it is
0.  This has never worked in a way that I consider correct in any
version of HyperCard.  What you're proving is that using set with the
params doesn't work, not that the set handler in the Home stack is
catching things.  You have to send an explicit message (which is what
a virus would be doing anyway).

Do the following in a button:

on mouseUp
  send "set the script of this stack to Virus!" to HyperCard
end mouseUp

This will bypass your set handler and zero the script of the current
stack (make sure it is one you don't care about, or copy the stack
script somewhere first) and put the single word "Virus!" in its place.
You could just as easily set it to the contents of a variable or field
which actually contained a virus.  To show how set doesn't work right
with the params, try the following to intercept set commands:

on set
  answer the paramCount
  answer "Set params are:" && the params
end set

The paramCount will be 0 and the params will contain only the set
command itself.

Apple explains all this with some comments about the difference
between commands and keywords.  Personally, I think it is a bug, or at
least an anomoly.

Here ya go;
I did test before calling you wrong; I have your script included as
script for my Home stack, with the addition of an Else/Pass Set for
conditions the script doesn't care about (sets other than script).  In
another stack, I have something which sets the stack script:

on mouseUp
  put -,  --just pretend the "-," is a continuation character (option l)
  "on idle" & return & "show message" & return & "end idle" & return -,
  into it
  set the script of this stack to it
  send "set the script of this stack to it" to HyperCard
end mouseUp

Your script in the Home stack certainly does catch the first, but not
the second....  (in HyperCard 1.2.5...)

I agree, this is perhaps the most important point that needs to be
made here.  If you read an article in a newspaper (even a normally
reputable one) about a new bullet the military had invented that flew
around corners and waited in dark alleys before striking its target,
you might want to do a little followup before getting upset.  More so
if the article ran on April 1st.

Hold it.  Wrong.  Dead wrong.  Computer viruses are a HUGE problem for
anyone who is even remotely connected with the maintenance of a
significant number of computers.  Ask someone who's home system has
just had its HD partition destroyed by a virus.  Ask someone who is
ready to go back to a typewriter because their new, spiffy Mac IIci
crashes at application launches due to WDEF.

Sure, if everyone was a super-hacker then viruses would have a much
harder time spreading.  Of course, viruses would probably be much
better at hiding themselves.  Proper "usage policies"?  Pray tell,
what are these?  We could set up fascist-like user rooms where users
can only submit batch jobs and never touch the computers, but we'd get
less accomplished that way.

Including source code with every program would help eliminate viruses,
but forgive me if I only pay attention to realistic options.  Likewise
running only programs not written by "persons with an equal lack of
knowledge".  Whatever that means.

Viruses are a problem.  A big one.  Are they're going to get worse.
Come on, don't pick on the users.  Attack, instead, the virus authors.
If these people would write useful code instead of malignant code,
then life would be grand.

Time to get off my soapbox, I guess.

In my experience, F-PROT is more reliable (and easier to use) than
McAfee's or Norton's products (I haven't looked at Virex-PC.)  The
latest version (1.15) is available via anonymous ftp from
beach.gal.utexas.edu.

F-PROT is less expensive than both.

There is nothing similar to SAM for the PC.  The PC's hardware
prevents the type of floppy disk checking that SAM uses on the Mac.

Viruses are indeed a problem.  We had our 100+ student open computer
lab hit with Scores & nVIR several years ago, and we've had viruses
here ever since.  The PCs have had Brain, Joshi, Ping, and others.  So
the AF/91 joke didn't bother us at all.  You HAVE to be vigilant
because there are many REAL viruses out there.  You don't have to be
obsessive because someone announces one more virus (in an article that
was clearly a joke for anything other than the extremely casual hasty
reader; anyone who reads things that poorly should not operate
computers in any case, as there are far more deadly surprises waiting
for them than an April Fool's joke).

Look, if someone announces a new sexually transmitted disease, and
they turn out to be wrong, are you hurt by practicing safe sex?  No
- --- only a fool believes that things are safe now in any case.

Subject: Viruses in LANs

Copyright (c) 1991

Part 1 of N.

Our gentle moderator notes that:

>Also, privileged users can bypass file protections.  If a privileged
>user executes an infected file, the LAN may become infected - again
>without the virus having any knowledge that it is infecting a LAN.

This is a good point that deserves elaboration.

First, what privileges are we talking about?  In order for a user to
infect a program on a LAN, he must be privileged to write to the
program and the program must be writeable.  That is, he must have
WRITE "rights" ("rights" are the privileges in the language used with
many LAN servers) to the program or he can not infect it.  He need not
be a "privileged" user in the sense of having SUPERVISOR privileges,
though that will clearly work.

If he has WRITE privileges to the program, he still may not be able to
WRITE to the program if it has an "attribute" of READ ONLY or EXECUTE
ONLY set on.  Thus two conditions must be met in order for the user to
be able to infect a program.  The manager of the LAN server can make
it resistant to infection by granting WRITE privileges sparingly and
using READ ONLY and EXECUTE ONLY generously.

One other privilege is relevant, i.e., MODIFY rights.  Some viruses
simply set all attributes on a target off before trying to write to
it.  In DOS, attributes can be reset by any user.  However, in order
to set an attribute on an object stored on a LAN server, the user
program must have MODIFY rights to the object.  Thus, the manager of
the LAN server may defeat his broad use of READ ONLY or EXECUTE ONLY
by granting MODIFY.

So, no action of a workstation user can result in the infection of a
program stored on the LAN server as long as that program is READ ONLY
or EXECUTE ONLY and he does not have the right to MODIFY those
attributes.  No action of his can result in the infection of a program
stored on the LAN server if he does not have WRITE privileges (rights)
to that program.  If the workstation user has no WRITE access to any
program objects stored on the LAN server, then no action of his can
cause the infection of anything on the LAN server and it cannot serve
as a vector to move the virus to any other workstation on the LAN.

The ability of a user to infect a program stored on the server is
necessary but not sufficient for the server to act as a vector.  In
addition to the program being infected by one user, it must be
executed by another.  Thus, if a workstation user cannot write to an
object stored on the LAN server that can be read by any other user,
then he cannot spread the virus to another user.  Thus, if the manager
of the LAN server does not grant one user READ access to any object to
which he grants another user WRITE access, he will make his server
resistant to spreading viruses.

Thus, it is possible to configure and manage a LAN server so as to
make it very resistant to spreading viruses.  However, I am sure that
most of you understand the limitations inherent in these statements.
Many users will have some WRITE access to programs which can be read
by others.  Any such can be a vector.  One obvious vector is the
\SHARE directory with which many LAN servers are configured.

N.B., a virus need not know anything about the LAN in order for the
LAN to serve as a vector.  It need only treat all targets the same,
wtihout regard to where they are stored.  None of the common viruses
do know anything about LANs.

Note also, the virus need not defeat or bypass any of the security
features of the LAN in order for the server to act as a vector.  It
need only exploit the privileges of the user.  Neither does it have to
execute on the server or infect any program that will execute on the
server.

Finally, notice that if a user signs on to a workstation that is
already infected by a virus, then the virus will act with his server
privileges.  If the SUPERVISOR signs on from an infected user
workstation, then his privileges will be used by the virus to infect
programs stored on the LAN server.  Since the boot sector or partition
table of the workstation may be infected, a privileged user should
never sign on to the server except when he has initialized the
workstation from a (personal) trusted copy of DOS.

I don't have much experience with "viruses" so forgive me.

Are there many problems with DOS viruses?  I have only noticed UNIX
and MAC problems.  A friend had his DOS machine fail...don't ask me
for the detail...not sure at this point.  He was out visiting
University of Arizona last week and had his application's diskette
with him.  He had copied something onto it.  It lost all sense of the
fact it had COM ports.

I wanted some generic info on DOS viruses.  Is there a good source of
information as to what is out there and what effect one should look
for?  Are there any good DOS Vaccines around?

Subject: 12-Tricks Trojan (PC)

Hello antiviralists,

it seems that the Twelve Tricks Trojan (or has it upgraded to virus by
now?)  has reached our university. At least, a user reports that a
certain ANTIVIR (which one?) reports an infection.  I have not yet
looked at the respective hard disks myself, so this is all a bit
vague.

Now, I am experiencing difficulties to retrieve relevant information
for 12-tricks. For instance, I cannot find an entry in Pat Hoffman's
VSUM9010 (I know it's not the latest one...). Am I missing a synonym
for 12-tricks?

The only info I could find up to now is the (first) warning, on
VALERT-L, by Christoph Fischer, issued on February 12, 1990.  I have
also done a database search on the VIRUS-L archives, but have not yet
retrieved the relevant issues (Is there a way to extract only *part*
of the digests? They're all several hundred lines long, and I have to
get them across the Big Pond... And I really need only the
12-trick-relevant bits.)

Would anybody point me to more recent information on the subject,
please?  Has this developped into a major epidemic or is it still
rare?

Thanks in advance for any help.

[NEWS ROUND-UP] [Fraud Office is hit by computer virus]

The mainframe computer used at the Serious Fraud Office in London has  been
invaded  by  a  rogue  program  "virus".  (writes CHRISTOPHER ELLIOTT.) The
virus, known as cascade because the letters on the screen  appear  to  fall
off  and form a sort of alphabet soup at the foot, was discovered last week
at the Elm Street [in London?] headquarters  of  the  SFO.  Officials  were
immediately   concerned  for  the  details  of  cases  under  investigation
involving tens of millions of pounds, which are  stored  on  the  computer.
Experts  were  called  to  tackle the virus, which first appeared in Europe
about 18 months ago and has rampaged across computer screens ever since  It
is  one  of  400 types which have caused havoc in research at hospitals and
universities around the world. Although the virus now has  been  eliminated
SFO  officials  still  do  not know how it weas introduced into the system.
.............................................................
[A.Appleyard: Note the word 'mainframe' although Cascade is a PC  virus.  I
take  it  that the affected computer is their "main (= chief) computer" and
the newspaper's "scientific  reporter",  who  is  likely  a  "jack  of  all
(scientific)  trades  and a master of none", muisunderstood; or a newspaper
subeditor mishandled the article after him.
