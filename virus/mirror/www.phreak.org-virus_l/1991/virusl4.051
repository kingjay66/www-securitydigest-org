Subject: Request for information - Robert Morris Internet worm (UNIX)

	I am writing a paper to analyze the effects of the Robert T.
Morris Internet worm of 1988.  I am collecting information and
opinions from system managers on the following topics:

	o  What effect did the attack have on your computer system.  How long
		was your system effected?  What was the estimated damage in
		dollars?

	o  How was the worm removed from your system?  How was information
		about the "cure" shared within the network community?

	o  What effect, if any, did the attack have on your perception of
		computer security?  What measures have you taken to prevent
		further attacks?

	o  Robert Morris was convicted and ordered to pay $10,000 and serve
		400 hours of community service.  Was this ruling fair?  What
		effect has this ruling had on deterring further computer
		crimes?

	Any and all information you can offer is appreciated.
	Please respond via email to gallo@cs.albany.edu.
	Thank you.

Subject: Re: "Six Bytes" (PC)

Greetings,
    Actually, an extremely simple method of generic 'virus detection'
for viruses which infect on execute (or open) is to create a program
that records the FREE DISK SPACE, then opens a file named 'TEST.COM'
and fills it with 8192 copies of 'INT 20h', then spawns out to execute
it.  The free disk space is loaded again, and compared against the
original minus 16384.  (8192*2 bytes of code.)  This should
successfully handle all cluster-sizes, etc.  If the values aren't
equal then there is Something Wrong(tm).

    Admittedly, it won't work on all viruses, but it sure will handle
the large majority of them.  Another useful trick is to have your
CONFIG.SYS SHELL your COMMAND.COM from a different filename, and load
it over to a RAMDISK in your AUTOEXEC.BAT...  Then (of course) set
COMSPEC=<ramdisk>:\COMMAND.COM...  It speeds up your system, too!
<Grin> (It helps against some of the Stealth viruses, but only a
little...)

    There are dozens of little precautions you can take to protect
your system from viruses.  None of them will work in all cases (the
most difficult being the direct action viruses...  Stopping them
easily is *ANNOYING*) but they do provide a modicum of security.

    I'll point out that Padgett Peterson has a reasonably correct idea
in stating that the place to start from *IS* from the boot sector, or
the partition table.  It's a cleaner environment down there, and can
be checked *MUCH* easier.

    A total system checkout is feasible, as frisk has suggested.  If
you have a memory resident virus, it *CAN* be detected.  Period.  For
it to work *WELL*, you have to know your system.  If you don't know
what's on your computer, it's tough for an AV product to accurately
tell you what's *NOT SUPPOSED* to be there.

    In relation to that, I'll put in my two cents about the six
bytes...  For a technician helping out a non-PC-literate user, it's
probably a good thing.  For a technician helping out a user with lots
of specialized drivers, and/or unusual partitioning stuff, etc., it's
can lead one down the wrong path entirely, if used as the FIRST check
on a system.

                                                        --  Morgan Schweers

P.S.  It sounds strange, I suppose, but if you're the type of person
      who takes precautions about possible 'new' virus infections,
      then you're a lot less likely to be the kind of person who GETS
      new virus infections.

Subject: Re: Taking out A: & USSR BBS

Greetings,
    I recently recommended to a network site that they lock their 'A'
drives with a network boot diskette in them.  Their 'B' drives should
remain unlocked for data transfer.  There are many companies that make
disk drive door-locks, and this is a much 'nicer' solution than
removing the drive entirely.  In fact, one could lock the drive doors
WITHOUT a disk in them, thus forcing a boot from the HD, and still
allowing access to the B drive by anyone (and access to the 'A' drive
by the computer-manager).

   The person commenting on the 'USSR BBS's' was SPECIFICALLY (as I
recall) talking about the 'pro-virus' BBS's in the USSR.  This is why
they commented on the possible increase in virus spreading rates.  The
actual number of BBS's available from outside of the USSR is
statistically insignificant for the tracking of viral spread.

   Moreover, as was said, BBS's are a very *RARE* way for viruses to
spread (with the exception of BBS's dedicated to viruses).  In fact,
the current leader in virus statistics is the Stoned virus, a virus
that is NOT INFECTIOUS through BBS's without hard work.  <Chuckle>

Subject: Stoned & Yale virus (PC)

Can someone tell me what the stoned virus does exactly?  Its been
going aroung and I've heard things from overwriting text files with
"Stoned Stoned..." to "messing" with the FAT.  Can someone confirm
this.  Also I would apriciate a description of the messing part.  What
does it really do?

Second, what is the Yale virus.  I have no clue on this one.  It
showed up using IBMs freeware scanner.  I find no mention of it in
SCAN documentation, although I have not tried to actually run SCAN on
an infected disk to see if it comes up under some alias.

Subject: "Six Bytes for Virus Detection" paper available (PC)

[Ed. This is the beginning of Padgett Peterson's paper, "Six Bytes for
Virus Detection in the MS-DOS Environment".  The complete paper is
available by anonymous FTP on cert.sei.cmu.edu in pub/virus-l/docs
under the filename six.bytes.padgett.]

WARNING: The method depicted in this paper will not detect every conceivable
         virus, to do so would take far more than six bytes. What it will
         do is to detect all currently "common" viruses for a knowlegable user,
         however, CHKDSK can do the same thing if intelligently applied. A
         short .COM file following these principles will make a good "first
         check" before using a scanner to determine if something unknown
         might be resident.

         Some viruses revealed immediately include Brain, Yale, Datalock,
         Stoned, 4096, Fish-6, Flip, Whale, Joshi, MusicBug, and Azusa.
         TSR viruses such as the Jerusalem, Sunday, and 1701/1704 variants
         will also be revealed if the user is knowlegable about the system.

                  Six Bytes for Virus Detection

                             in the

                        MS-DOS Environment


                                        A. Padgett Peterson, P.E.
                                        Orlando, Florida


                          Introduction

     Concerning the size of the population (over fifty million MS-DOS
platforms  at  last estimate), to the macro, the 240+  known  viruses
represent  a relatively small statistic. In the micro  however,  they
can be devastating.

     With  the growth in size of fixed disks and applications,  often
backups  are obsolete or incomplete where proper discipline  has  not
been  established. Unfortunately, this seems to include the  majority
of the non-power users.

     Since  the number of known viruses appears to be  doubling  each
year, the threat is not diminishing, yet the most accepted utilities,
John  McAfee's SCAN & CLEAN, rely on detection of  known  infections.
While  there  are  some  products  that  actually  perform  integrity
management  of  a system (Certus International  CERTUS,  Enigma-Logic
VIRUS-SAFE and PC-SAFE, Fischer International PC-WATCHDOG, Dr.  Panda
BEARTRAP),  most are oriented to file protection rather  than  system
protection.

     To  adequately  protect  a  machine  that  possesses  no  native
integrity management requires a layered approach of user  management,
files/applications management, and systems management. We have a good
handle  on  the  first two but the  question  of  systems  integrity,
something  so pervasive in mainframes that it is taken  for  granted,
does not currently exist for the PC.

     Until  recently, a large enough population did not exist of  not
only successful but also unsuccessful viruses to draw any  inferences
concerning their viability in the general population. At the close of
1990, however, certain characteristics of "successful" viruses, those
listed  as "common" in Patricia Hoffman's Virus Summary, have  become
clear:

1: Become resident in memory following infection

2: Allocate memory to themselves

3: Redirect part of the operating system (not necessarily interrupts)

     Each  of these elements is easily detected, often in  more  than
one  way, yet few people or programs bother to look. Some years  ago,
this  author  wrote   three simple assembly language  programs,  each
about 1k bytes long. The first tests file integrity, the second tests
disk integrity, and the third tests system integrity. Taken  together
these still detect every "common" virus, not because they "know"  all
viruses  but  because  they "know" an  uninfected  system.  There  is
nothing magical involved, merely a knowledge of how the  architecture
operates.

     This paper does not address those viruses that attach themselves
to  programs or files specifically, rather consideration is  made  to
those  that  attack  elements of the  operation  system.  That  these
infections may later attack programs or files is incidental.  Rather,
a description is provided of the third of these routines.
