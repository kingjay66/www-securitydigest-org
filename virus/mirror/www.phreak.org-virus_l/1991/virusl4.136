VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

I NEVER buy newspapers - they are not worth the trees felled to produce
them.

2. I take TV news with a pinch of salt - they only show things that have
   interesting pictures with them - most of the other stuff they ignore.

3. Radio news is useful for the political headlines. Especially when you
   understand several languages, and get the news from different sources.

4. Even technical papers can be wrong - but if they wrote in English,
   instead of some academicese (or whatever) we might even be able to
   spot that! :-)

The "stealth" viruses do not bother changing the CRC, when resident, they
just always return the correct program so that it matches the CRC wherever
it is stored & however it is calculated.

This brings to light the inherant problem with self-checking CRC (even those
that use DES or better) programs, they are self checking.

Understanding this requires consideration of the order in which an infected
program with a "self-checker" and infected by a "stealth" virus will execute.

1) User requests program to be run
2) CLI (typically COMMAND.COM) loads program into memory & transfers execution
3) The virus, takes control on load since it has subverted the initial code
   (may be only 3-5 bytes).
4) The virus goes resident in memory, removes itself from low memory, and
   restores original program.
5) Virus code transfers control to original program
6) Self checker executes - if it checks self in memory, it finds original
   code - if checks self on disk, virus intercepts call & strips virus off
   code first, presenting original code.
7) Self check passes test

Now consider the case where the checksum routine is resident in memory.

1) User requests program to be run
2) CLI (typically COMMAND.COM) loads program into memory & transfers execution
3) Resident checker intercepts execution transfer and performs checksum on
   code loaded into memory
4) Virus is detected before going resident and execution is disallowed.

Since the virus is detected before execution, "stealth" will not help it.

Now there are some caveats to the above scenario to prevent "end-runs" by
virus code, primarily in that the checker becomes resident no later than as
part of CONFIG.SYS (better if from BIOS, but as first line in CONFIG.SYS
is probably Good Enough. Risk increases dramatically if residence is from
AUTOEXEC.BAT or later since viruses have been known to go straight for
COMMAND.COM & if integrity management code is added later, "stealth" will
have a means to go resident before the anti-virus program loads.

Currently, there seem to be three schools of thought about where the checksum
should be stored. McAfee Associates /AV switch adds about ten bytes to the end
of an executable program. Norton Anti-Virus adds a 77 byte file to the
directory containing the executable file. Enigma-Logic's Virus-Safe creates
a special file in its directory that contains all checksum values.

My personal preference is for the Enigma-Logic methodology since it does not
rely on anything in the file being opened or the current directory. Self
checking files may fail on any addition and extra clusters can add up fast.
(These are the three products I am most familiar with - obviously there
are others).

However, ANY integrity checking is several orders of magnitude better than
none.

It is not only the hardware which is providing ROM shadowing,
but also Expanded Memory Manager programs such as QEMM and
386max. While I sincerely hope that all such programs will set
the memory type to read-only in the segment descriptor
attributes, I have not done an exhaustive verification of this
function.

In reviews of memory managers it would be good for the
reviewers to use a verification of protection of shadowed ROM
as a pass/fail test for the packages.

Subject: Is Dark Avenger Really here? (PC)

Well, I have a bit of a weird one that I _suspect_ may be a false
trip...

McAfee VIRUSCAN Version 7.6V80 _sometimes_ indicates that it has found
Dark Avenger in memory.  Doing a "DIR /W" seems to reliably clear that
message from SCAN.  From what I under- stand about Dark Avenger this
should not happen.  *I think* that once Dark Avenger goes resident, it
stays.

Given the fact that we have had a MAJOR infection of Dark Avenger on
campus, we're all paranoid...

Scanning the disks with the /a option (scan every file) finds nothing.

Can y'all offer any suggestions?  I need to clear this one up.

No, I was commenting on the fact that the quality of the algorithm is
not the important issue - simple checksumming or a complicated one-way
hash function, it really does not matter - if the implementation does
not catch stealth viruses it is not perfect.  Granted, it may detect
the infection of any non-stealth virus, but unless it is (for example)
able to catch Frodo, the actual algorithm used does not matter to me.

  Virtual 386 is a hardware mode. I assure you that if it slowed the

employ it, such as QEMM, 386MAX, and EMM386.

        With regards to those of you who have been writing to say that
        McAfee's Scan v7.6, or 7.7, or 7.XX, don't correctly identify a
        virus, likewise that the v 7.XX of Clean doesn't remove it

        - Why don't you guys get v8.0 of it?  Maybe it works.  This isn't
        a plug for McAfee, this is just what seems to me to be a very
        logical thing to do.  If you are using an out-dated virus
        detector/remover then you should not be surprised when it doesn't
        do what you want it to do.

someone else's words. Bill's comments and sources are well taken but they

To apply the proper term, this is a SPOOF and such have been known in the
mainframe world for years.

First, a TSR must take memory from somewhere and so far this has been
fairly redily detectable (usually just with CHKDSK). Second, it must
take control of some normally executed code. This is also detectable by
a reasonably well-engineered integrity management routine.

Good thinking except that DOS itself "fixes" a number of interrupts and
adds several "features" that MicroSoft does not care to document that make
use of conventional (i.e. documented) interrupts unnecessary. Your question
about the interrupt table vectors indicates that you should begin with
a review of DOS structures. (e.g. Ray Duncan's "Advanced MS-DOS" -plug)

Usually CHKDSK is sufficient. Some time ago I wrote a basic paper on the
subject (6 Bytes). Though deliberately somewhat simplistic, it should give
some ideas on how to detect "stealth" and what is necessary for "stealth"
to operate. I believe Ken has it in the Virus-L archives on CERT.

Yes

First, many PCs slow waaaaay down when infected, others crash a lot. Secondly,
over 4k of RAM space disappears from CHKDSK and infected files report
problems. The problem is that to hide, the virus has to lie to DOS and this
is a Bad Thing. Many viruses are detectable by looking for what isn't there.
