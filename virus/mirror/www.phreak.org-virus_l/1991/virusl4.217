Both Fred and Frisk are wrong here, IMHO... A program, which uses the
protected mode correctly CANNOT BE CIRCUMVENTED. Period. There is no
way to do anythig that such a program cannot intercept and control. I
won't argue whether this is a software or hardware solution, but it is
just as reliable as the write protection tab.

Of course, the design of the 80286+ might be buggy (which I don't
believe) and there might be some backdoors, but so what? There are
(buggy) floppy drives on which the write protection tab does not
protect as well.

The point, however, is not whether protected mode programs or write
protection tabs can be circumvented. They can't. The point is, that
they are not a virus protection. A virus might wait until the
protected objects are made available for writing, or might trick the
operator to it... A virus does not -need- to circumvent anything
(although most Messy-DOS viruses do, since there is almost no
protection, which is pretty easy to circumvent), in order to spread.
The reason is that the current OSes provide secrecy, instead of
integrity. All this is very well explained in Fred Cohen's
dissertation, papers, and his excellent "A Short Course in Computer
Viruses".

One can argue whether a protection is useful or not, since it is a
matter of taste - what level of protection us useful for someone, is
pretty useless for another. However, it is very easy to design a
software-only protection, which is not possible to circumvent by
software only.

Just write a small TSR program, which intercepts the Exec function
call and aborts it. This way, once this program is executed, you have
no way to start an infected program, and therefore, introduce a virus.
No virus, no matter how clever, is able to circumvent this. A pure
software protection, that cannot be circumvented by software. It is
also pretty useless, but this is not the point.

BTW, I thought that I've already explained you this in our private
communication...

As the above examples shows, your statement is false as well. The
point is that any protection (regardless whether hardware or software)
cannot stop viruses in -some- cases, and no protection (regardless
whether software or hardware) is useful in -all- cases. Let everyone
select what s/he thinks is best suited to him/her.

Well, in fact the hardware also needs to be updated, just not so
often... Will you use an (old) floppy drive if you discover that it
simply ignores the write-protection tab? Aren't we seeing the hardware
around us to be constantly updated with new models?

Well, if it was all that simple, we wouldn't need any protection any
more... Since we already have the write-protection tabs on our
diskettes, since they don't need to be updated, cannot be circumvented
and so on. The hard disks? Oh, well, if no virus can infect a diskette
(since we have this wonderful write-protect tab hardware protection),
how it will make it to the hard disk?

Oh, it's easy. If you are executing it, it must be executable. The
virus only needs to hook the Exec function and infect everything that
it tries to exec, regardless of its extension. The exact type of the
file (EXE or COM) can be determined from the first two bytes of its
contents. Most intelligent viruses (even Cascade!) proceed like that,
so changing the extensions does not help a lot (except agains the
stupid viruses).

Ooops, the above two-instruction program has a bug... :-) I just
tested it, it does not detect Dir II at all. The reason is that Dir II
hides the write protection error at device driver (sector input)
level, not at critical error handler error. So, it's still safer to
try to delete files from write protected floppies... :-)

A lot of resident viruses show such behaviour, indeed, especially the
boot sector ones. However, the controller configuration of some
computers make them eat up 1 Kb of RAM too. On most intelligent setups
(those that are built in ROM), it is possible to specify whether this
amount of memory will be taken from the top of the available memory
(therefore reducing the amount of memory available to DOS) or from one
of the low-address segments (was it 0300h?). The latter does not show
any decreasing of the amount of memory available. Unfortunately, the
PS/2 systems do not have this good feature (what is really good on IBM
originals?). They are meant to be set up by a special setup program,
which is specific for the particular model. I believe that in your
case you are not infected. BTW, the PS/2 50 Z on which I am working
right now says that it has 639 Kb available only as well... :-)

No, I bet that this is how you received your machine - with 639 Kb
memory available.

Sorry, but the above has almost no sense...

Again, you're probably not infected, but nevertheless, check it with a
good scanner, just to be on the safe side. Hope the above helps.

First, you misquoted me... :-) I didn't say that a virus belongs to a
certain family just because a program is able to disinfect it. I said
that a general algorithm for disinfecting close Jerusalem variants has
been implemented by a friend of mine, and that this algorithm happened
to work on the Fu Manchu virus as well. Therefore, Fu Manchu belongs
to this class.

Yes, a program is able to do everything it was programmed to... :-)

You have not seen the program, so please don't judge what it is able
to do and what not. You have no way to know it in advance.

It depends what the taxonomy is based on.

Many PS/2 models use 1K of RAM in their standard mode of operation.  I'm
not sure whether it's for loading ROM to RAM or for some other purpose,
but contrary to numerous warnings I've seen posted, having 639K on a
PS/2 is NOT (necessarily) indicative of being infected by a virus.

Subject: Computer virus report from Bulgaria

Hello, everybody!

I just received a report from the Laboratory of Computer Virology at
the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences in Sofia, Bulgaria, about the
news in the virus situation there. These are news since I left
Bulgaria, which was about three and a half months ago.

First of all, a project for a law, concerning copywright of computer
software, has been introduced to the Bulgarian Parliament. Having in
mind the expeditivity with which this parliament works, with a bit of
luck we could have this law voted in 2-3 years... :-)

Next, two known non-Bulgarian viruses have reached Bulgaria. Both are
boot sector infectors. They are the Azusa and the Michael Angelo
viruses. The Azusa virus has even caused a small epidemic in
Mihajlovgrad. The people from the Lab have advised the victims of the
attack to use a newer version of McAfee's CLEAN, since the one that
the victims already had (something before 82) was not able to remove
the virus.

The domestic virus writers don't sleep either. At least 7 new viruses
have been discovered, all of them of Bulgarian origin. These are
Damage 1.1 and 1.3 (which, according to a string in them are made in
Plovdiv), a new version of Murphy, a new version of Terror, a new
virus, called Brainy (file infector, has nothing to do with the Brain
virus), and two new variants of the Dir II virus. Needless to say, the
two new Dir II variants are not detected by SCAN 84... :-(

Since there already exists a virus, called Damage (a Diamond variant),
I changed the name of the new ones to "Bulgarian Damage". The people
from the Lab have described one of the variants (1.3) in a Computer
Virus Catalog Entry format and I'll publish it in a separate message.

There has also been a case of trojanization of McAfee's SCAN (again!),
which I'll describe in a separate posting as well..

Vesselin

I'm having problems with what appears to be a virus. The symptoms are
the the machine freezes/hangs if the keyboard hasn't been press for
over about 5 minutes. A hard boot is necessary. The system I'm using
is a 286 with DOS 4.01.  I've tried various virii scanning programs
(e.g McAfee's v7.2C76,virscan) to no availe. Originally I though it
was a hardware problem related to my autoscreensaver herc card.

Thats the normal state of affairs for the PS/2.  I believe some other
systems such as Hewlett-Packard Vectras also have the same 'feature'.

Virus detected when.: Sep 1991
              where.: Plovdiv, Bulgaria
Classification......: Program virus, Extending, Resident

- --------------------- Preconditions -----------------------------------
Operating System(s).: MS-DOS
Version/Release.....: 2.xx and upward, special support for 3.30

                       of INT 21h and INT 13h handlers, therefore
                       bypasses all active monitors.
Infection Trigger...: Programs are infected at load time (using the
                       function Load/Execute of MS-DOS), and whenever
                       a file is Opened with the extension of .COM or .EXE.
Media affected......: Any logical drive
Interrupts hooked...: INT 21h functions 4Bh, 3Dh are used to infect
                       files. Functions 11h and 12h are used to hide
                       virus infection in files.
                      INT 24h and INT 13h are temporary captured to
                       mask out errors.
                      INT 32h contains original INT 21h handler.
Damage..............: The virus formats all available tracks on current drive.
Damage trigger......: The virus carries an evolution counter that
                       is decreased every time the virus is executed.
                       When the counter is equal to 0, the virus reads
                       the system timer. If the value of hundreds is greater
                       than 50, the virus will format all available tracks
                       on current drive(this is effectively a 50% chance
                       of destruction). "Current" drive is any logical drive
                       on which file is opened, executed or searched thru
                       FindFirst/FindNext.
Particularities.....: The virus knocks out the transient part of COMMAND.COM
                       forcing it to be reloaded and thereby infected.
			Therefore, it is a "fast infector".

I concur that DiskDefender is a great product.  It has two relatively
minor problems.  The first is that it is only available for MFM drives
and will not be availible for any other drives.  The second, and also
the cause of the first, is the company is out of business.

Other than that, its a great product.  (We have probably 75 in service.)

(Oh, it has a third problem I just remembered about.  It fails open.
Yep, when it fails it usually renders the drive writable.  Again, this
isn't going to be fixed in any later releases due to #2 above.)

Subject: Warning! SCAN 82 trojanized! (PC)

Hello, everybody!

Version 82 of McAfee's program SCAN has been trojanized in Bulgaria.
The executable file has been modified to include a new virus and the
archive, modified in such a way has been uploaded to a Bulgarian BBS.

It was a pure luck that the virus didn't spread. Due to a bad
installation of the BBS, the uploaded archive was sent to an area, in
which nobody noticed it (even not the SysOp) and it has not been made
available for download. Just by chance, Eugene Nikolov, who is
currently the head of the Laboratory of Computer Virology in Sofia and
also turns to be a SysOp (of another BBS) as a hobby, noticed the
forgotten file when he visited the SysOp of the victim BBS to discuss
something about installation. He also noticed that the archive was
about 1 Kb larger than the one he has received recently from me.

Further investigation showed that:

1) The file SCAN.EXE from the archive has been modified (not
infected!) in a special way, in order to include a virus between the
EXE header and the code part of the file.

2) The virus was new, but of the Phoenix familly, or at least it used
the same encryption method and mutated. The virus is currently
investigated simultaneously at the LCV in Sofia and in the VTC
Hamburg. It seems to infect COM files only, therefore making the
chances that somebody will look for it in an EXE program even lower.

3) No version of SCAN (including 84) was able to detect the virus.

4) The documentation files in the archive have been modified, in order
to include the new (infected) values for SCAN's length and VALIDATE
codes.

5) SCAN.EXE has been modified not to detect that it has been infected.

6) The authentification code of the ZIP archive was almost intact. The
command
	pkunzip -t SCNAV82.ZIP
would output the following:

authentification code is relatively easy. It also seems that the
Bulgarian hackers have found an authomated way to do it. Anyway, all
SCAN trojanizations about which I know, have the string displayed
about changed in some ways. So, it seems to be a good idea to always
check for it, not only for the presence of the -AV info...

A copy of the trojanized archive has been forwarded to Morgan Schweers
from McAfee Associates. Encrypted, of course. Meanwhile, I strongly
urge all the users to stop using version 82 of SCAN and to upgrade to
version 84. I also strongly urge McAfee Associates to find a more
reliable way to distribute their programs, especially having in mind
that they are the most often trojanized programs in the world.

The current version of the package uses three levels of protection.
	- The ZIP authentification code
	- The VALIDATE info in the docs
	- The self-checking that each of the executables perform
All of these have proven to be unnecessary sophisticated and
completely useless against a dedicated attack. It -IS- possible (and
even relatively easy) to devise an authentification scheme, based on
public-key digital signatures, which -will- work. The only problems
might be legal ones (the RSA public-key cryptosystem which I have in
mind is patented, but I guess that a large company like McAfee
Associates can afford the license, in order to provide security for
their users).

If nobody from McAfee Associates is able to devise such scheme, I
could figure one out myself and post it here.

While this has nothing to do with viruses, I just tried to create an
encrypted disk partition (with Norton's DISKREET) and to install
Stacker on it (couldn't do the opposite, since encrypted stuff does
not compress). Stacker complained that it cannot be installed on a
logical volume... :-( Probably it won't be possible to install it on a
DiskManager partition as well...

Not to be extolling the virtue of a dead horse instead of beating it
but, I use DD on older systems (at this point less than 10 of about
70 still in service) protecting the MBR against Stoned and other
similar ilk.

(Anybody wants to buy new, sealed DD boards let me know)
