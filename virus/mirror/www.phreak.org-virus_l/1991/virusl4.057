Jim, by the time you read this the next demo version of the Virex-PC
scanner should be available.  Virex-PC now handles PKLITE compressed
files as well as LZEXE compressed files.  Next step: LH compressed and
.ZIP files.

I should have responded to this earlier, but I've been in
"one-last-bug" mode for the last month.  The demo gets released today
- -- just writing the final cut of the docs for it.  The old one handled
150 strings, this one handles 350.  The old one was faster, so's this
one.  Grab a copy, and lemme know what you think?

Oh!  I convinced The Powers That Be at Microcom to let me release
monthly (or near monthly) updates of the free scanner.  Stay tuned!

Not to take away from Norton's new entry in the anti-virus field, lots
of scanners have the ability to add new virus tags through an external
file, including my own.

In fact, to document this file for the first time publicly:

1)  The file must be on the C: drive in a directory called "C:\VIREXPC"
2)  The file must be called "VIREXPC.VIR"
3)  The file consists of lines.  Each line starts with a 'P', a 'B' or a '#'.
    A line starting with a '#' is a comment line.
    A line starting with a 'P' is a "Program Virus"
    A line starting with a 'B' is a "Boot Virus"
4)  Following the 'B' or 'P' is a single space.
5)  Following the single space is the hex representation of upto sixteen
    bytes of signature information.  Although you may have less then
    sixteen bytes, you must have at least ten bytes.  Additionally, you
    must have an even number of bytes.  This is the ASCII representation
    of the value of these signature bytes:  If searching for 'AB', then the
    resulting hex search string would be "4141".
6)  Optionally, after the signature bytes maybe come a checksum and a
    "nasty" flag.
    If you're including either, follow the signature bytes by a single
    space.
    If the virus is a "nasty" virus -- one that you'd want to halt the
    scanner if you find it in memory, use the "Nasty Virus" flag: a single
    exclamation point.
    The checksum is a simple unsigned checksum of the signature byte's
    real value: not the value of the ASCII representation of these values,
    but the actual values.

An example:

# This here is a comment
P ProgVName 123434565678789090121234 1234!

No, the checksums don't add up on that example.

Sorry for the delay, Chris: why is the last 1% of any new release
always the hardest part to get out the door?

Ah hah!  The clever marketing ploy worked! You used the demo, then
bought the product.  I'll tell the marketing guy at Microcom - he'll
be pleased.  Don't worry: I get serious in just a sec....

You're 100% absolutely right, Chris.  Not sticking in some information
regarding the drop-dead date was a dumb mistake on my part -- I wish I
could blame it on somebody else.

The new scanner (discussed below) has a drop-dead date of September 1,
1991.  Between now and then, I expect to release a number of new
demos, each updated with new features and new strings.  Until the July
release, or thereabout, all of them will have the 9/1/91 drop-dead
date. Starting with the July release the drop-dead date will be
somewhat further removed into the future: I'm not sure what I'll set
it for, but I'll certainly let it be known in advance: a bonehead
mistake like letting the expiration date on the current scanner lapse
before releasing the new one should never have happened.

Did I mention how much I hate Windows at all recently? :-)

Picking a date back in October of 1990 (allowing for what was supposed
to be six months of operation sounded so good on paper, too: I never
thought about an expiry of April 1 having any significance.  Yeah,
that was dumb, too.)

Nope.  No hacked version of the code.  Just stupidity on my part.
However, now that I'm done with the Windows version of the code, I've
gotten some commonsense back.

I'm better now! :-)

Subject: Possible HyperCard virus (mac)

I'm hoping someone out there can help me.  I have a user (I'm a
consultant) who thinks he may have a virus.  When he is using
HyperCard 1.2.5 with a stack that is 300-400 K in size (it is just one
specific stack) he is getting a lot of bombs.  When he tries to script
a new card for the stack he gets a bomb at various times as follows:
	As soon as he starts scripting
	When he tries to end the scripting

His machine also freezes at times when he does the above.  Sometimes
the bomb is an out of memory error.

All this work has been done on an SE/30 with 5mb of RAM and also on a
IIci with 4mb RAM with the same results.  Both machines are running
system version 6.0.5.

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.  Since this is within HC, I
doubt if Disinfectant 2.4 will pick it up.  He is currently trying
Disinfectant.

Thanks in advance.

Subject: Script to kill new HC (and all other HC) viruses/trojans, etc. (Mac)

Alright already!  Enough with the EMAIL!  Stop!  First, I disagree
that Dukakis was a virus since it lacked the capacity to replicate and
spread - it would simply make one move and stop.  I think it would be
better to call it a trojan since it was disguised as somthing else
(i.e. nude pictures).  HOWEVER I DON'T CARE HOW WE CLASSIFY IT!!!
I'VE GOTTEN LOTS OF MAIL ABOUT THIS NEW CRITTER, SO HERE IS A GENERAL
PURPOSE SCRIPT THAT WILL STOP ALL KNOWN HC VIRUSES AND TROJANS.
Install this script in your HOME stack (in the stack info) - if you
run 2.0, and are redirecting the inheritence path to include a
library, put it there.  The only stipulation is that this be the only
script that intercepts the SET command.  If others intercept the
command, then parts of this must be imbedded (if you can't figure it
out, EMAIL me).

on set -- primitive anti-HC trojan/virus protection
   if the params contains "script " then -- notice the space after script
      -- THE SPACE IS ESSENTIAL SINCE ANY BUTTONS THAT HAVE THE WORD "SCRIPT"
      -- IN THEM WILL SEND THIS MESSAGE WHEN THEY ARE HILITED, ETC.
      play "boing"
      answer the params with "YES" or "NO"
      if it is "YES" then pass set
   end if -- the params contains "script " then
end set

this will intercept all "set the script of " type commands.

hope it helps...

Does anyone have any experience in the protection of networks of PC's
running an ethernet and served via a SUN using PC-NFS.

How does one make the Sun secure from viral infection where users
require read/write access to the networked disk?

What is the recommended software that we should use in this case?

A very scary thought when you consider that the bad guy in "The
Cookoo's egg" was caught because of a billing error and the tenacity
of one individual.  The insights that book offers into the foilables
of the typical system manager and the attitudes towards this type of
thing are interesting.  Would it be better to take for granted that
your security has been breached and operate based on that?  If you did
make that assumption, what would you do to make a first level check?

Subject: Is virus infection by inserting floppy disk possible? (PC) (Mac)

Hi,

I've been monitoring Virus-l digest since December and now for the
first time have a question.

Is it possible for a virus, trojan, worm, etc. to infect a hard disk
or RAM simply by inserting an infected floppy into a drive without
execution??

I thought I saw something on how some PC's /MAC's can recognize the
presence of a floppy after insertion without the benefit of an access
command being entered.

With a single restriction, you are not subject to a virus under these
conditions. The sole caveat being that you are not connected to a system
the performs on-line updates to the communications software in your PC.
(the PC software would have to permit this, it cannot be done unilaterally)
Since I know of several commercial packages that appear to have this
capability and do not know which you are using, the restriction may or may
not apply.

I have seen figures that seem reasonable from personal experience that
large sites (over 1000 PCs) rarely have a month go by without a confirmed
virus report. (and I am SICK of the Jerusalem and Stoned).

Partly true: once you are under MS-DOS, you can't close all the holes
(especially the undocumented ones), but if you start before MS-DOS and
encapsulate it, you can come close enough for government work. I keep
mentioning this since a good system starting at the BIOS level is able
to creating a reasonably secure system. Once that is available, we can
quit worrying about the next "super stealth" killer virus that infects
extended memory and get back to some real work.

For all of its faults, there are a lot of good things to be said about
MS-DOS since it has transformed the way we think about computers. The
biggest is that it demonstates the law of quantum economics: The market
forces change until something becomes "Good Enough", once this occurs,
the market becomes resistant to change and rewards only improvement.

A good example is the proliferation of pointing devices (mice, trackballs,
pens, etc.) that just shows that "Good Enough" has not appeared yet.
Similarly, the plethora of menuing schemes that existed before Windows 3.0
was another example that has now resolved.

It will be interesting to see how MAC 7.0 is received.

>...and is infecting any diskette I happen to boot with...

The "Bloody" (apologies to UK readers) virus cannot remain resident through
a cold (power off) boot from an uninfected floppy in a normal PC. period. If
it is, then something strange is going on (like a BIOS that forces boots from
C  & I hope the readers understand the implications of this in view of some
earlier discussions).

This virus is similar to the STONED and functions in much the same way. The
original partition table/code (MBR) is stored at cyl 0 head 0 sector 6 and
a good technician or the current version of McAfee's SCAN/CLEAN will take
care of the problem. When resident, it can be detected by the si...(oops,
promised no more mention of my "primitive" technique) by CHKDSK which will
report a loss of 2k from the TOM (640k machine will report 653312 "total
bytes memory" instead of 655360. If in memory, it must be removed (through
clean reboot) for any disinfection to be effective.

Note: as in any infection of this type, it is essential that all infected
diskettes (and there must be at least ONE or there is a bigger problem)
be found and disinfected else you will get a lot of practise in removal.

                                          Warmly,

Subject: Do I have a virus? (PC)

    My computer's been locking up on me for about a week now and it's
driving me NUTS!  Every once in a while, it will just lock up and say
Divide overflow.  I then have to reset (warm reboot doesn't work - I'm
using an IBM compatible by the way).  I have one program (TrakBlaster
for my soundblaster) that will lock it up every time - but other
programs that do the same thing don't.  If I load up Turbo C, I can
run it all day with no problem, but if I exit it and start running
some other programs the thing freezes.  It seems to be based on the
number of different programs executed instead of on a time limit.
    Has anyone out there had this problem or is this more likely to be
just a hardware problem?  I've tried several shareware virus detectors
but none of them have found anything - of course none of them could
find the test virus signature in the program that came with tbscanx
either.  Does anybody want to buy a computer - cheap?
