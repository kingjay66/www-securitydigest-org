You are drawing conclusions from personal biases. Simply because
members of SUZY do not subscribe to your IN, does not mean they are
unaware of the danger of viruses. It simply means that they did not
want to join your IN. Rather than allowing your 'statistics' to
incorrectly lead people to false assumptions, let's clarify:

	1) SUZY is a 'Pay to play' service
	2) INtegrity is not an 'exclusive' source of information
	3) INtegrity's user base is in all likelihood oriented
	   towards 'personal' systems rather than 'corporate'
	   systems (I draw this conclusion from my own experiences
	   with the SUZY network) A niche that is already well
	   covered by BBS systems.

Now, as a user, why would I pay good money to join a
SIG/FORUM/IN/whatever wneh I can probably get the same or better
information for free from a local BBS or E-MAIL list? (Better, simply
because more people subscribe to 'freebies' than 'pay to play'
services and also people are more likely to post information when they
aren't being charged to contribute). I am a supporter of SUZY. (Though
I still prefer CompuServe, BIX and even PORTAL as far as 'pay'
services are concerned) But I refuse to let your biased rantings go
unchallenged. The following stats came from 3 BBS's:

	Percentage of users that subscribe to the 'virus' sections

		68%, 77% and 83%!

	Message activity (rating/number of active sections)

		37/145, 8/63 and 10/38

Apathy? I don't think so. One anti-virus program had been retrieved
more than 500 times in the past 6 months! Most corporate security
precautions include some form of computer virus control. Most BBS's
make a point of checking programs for viruses prior to advertising
them on their systems. I wish we could be this 'apathetic' about our
environment and our fellow human beings. I think it's time for a
large dose of reality, Rob. Why not look at how to make your 'IN' more
appealing instead of trying to convince people that it's representative
of the 'real world'

Subject: Q: Do I Have a Virus? (PC)

I would like to ask this community to consider an odd symptom on two
machines I use, and tell me if this anomaly is characteristic of a
virus:

On two IBM PC's, one, a PS/2 Model 50; the other, an AT (circa '86), I
notice that 'chkdsk' on the hard drives result in there being an
identical number (and memory cost) of 'bad sectors' reported for both
machines.

Now, should I worry about viruses? Is there a viable chance that there
happens to be the same number of bad sectors on both machines? If this
sounds like a virus, which one could it be?

I appreciate any consideration given to my problem, and thank all
e-mailers in advance for any response given.

Not a bad idea, although it would have to be done carefully, and wouldn't
be 100% certain anyway.

You see, boot viri generally remove the original boot sector to a safe
location, and then install themselves in the original boot sector
location.  They are then run first.  After that, they are perfectly
content to let the normal OS take over ... under supervision, as it
were.

I could see your scheme working with some current viri, if the
original boot sector "pointed" to another program which checked the
boot sector to see if it was intact, andonly then called the OS.  This
would deal with a number of current viri, including Stoned.  It would
not, unfortunately, deal with "stealth" boot viri like Joshi, and I
can see virus writers getting around it in other ways as well.

Still, it's a thought.

The reason is that INSTALL.EXE is packed, using the LZEXE program.  If
it had been infected before it was packed, normal scanning would not
find the virus.

I added the ability to scan LZEXE-packed files to F-PROT, but the
routine for scanning LZEXE-packed file has two problems - it is a bit
slow, as it is written in C - I have not had the time to rewrite it in
assembly language.

The other problem, which is the cause of the above difficulties, is
that F-FCHK will write a temporary file to the current drive.  If the
current drive is A: and the floppy disk is write-protected, this error
may occur.  I am planning to rewrite this in version 2.0 - doing the
unpacking in memory.

I don't know if you are alone, but the "Eddie lives somewhere in time"
and the "Eddie die somewhere in time" phrases are taken from the heavy
metal band Iron Maiden. Eddie is their mascot and "Somewhere In Time"
is the title of their album which was released in 1986. Iron Maiden
and the other heavy metal bands are really popular in the Eastern
Europe.

BTW, the texts in the Anthrax virus ("Anthrax" and "Damage Inc.") are
also taken from two heavy metal bands. Anthrax is a quite popular band
from the USA and the Damage Inc. was the cover name used by Metallica,
also from the USA. Both of these bands play so-called speed metal, but
the Iron Maiden plays more old-fashioned heavy metal.

Subject: Sun workstation virii? (UNIX)

In the archives that I have seen so far for VIRUS-L, most of the
information seems to be on PC virii. What about virii for Sun
workstations? We are starting to download public domain software for
our Sun 4's, and were wondering about potential virus risks. Thanks.

Subject: We seem to have a new virus (PC)

Hello,

We could use a little help.  We have a PC which seems to have a virus
which is undetectable by SCAN6.3V72.  Like most, it infects
COMMAND.COM and then procedes to infect all executables.  As far as we
can tell, it changes the first 8-12 bytes and then appends about
1579-1591 bytes on the end of the file.  It does change the date and
time for the file.  It doesn't display any message or signature
associated with it.  If a disk is write protected, it doesn't error
but it will make the drive sound like it is eating your disk for
lunch.  The infected files generally seem to either lock up the
computer or cause errors when executing the program.  As of this time,
we have only spotted it on one computer.

I would greatly appreciate any assistance in identifying the virus.  I
am going to try to get in touch with McAfee Assoc. to help with this
"pain in the lower tender region."

Thanks.

Actually, it isn't anything subliminal.  Dark Avenger, according to the  |
New York Times,is a Bulgarian.  Families I've stayed with in Poland and  |
Czechoslovakia have explained that virtually the only "entertainment"    |
available in theaters and on television in East-bloc countries before   o.
1989 were Soviet and domestic political and Communist historical films
such as those mentioned by Mr. Radai.  The American films now shown on
Polish and Czech television aren't exactly Academy Award classics.

There was and still is an active underground selling pirated
recordings recordings of heavy-metal and 1960's groups.  Boys in
villages and large cities in Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary wore
T-Shirts and leather jackets with Iron Maiden, Metallica, MegaDeth,
and Poison on them.  Even though casettes from these groups are now
available in stores in the larger cities, they are expensive (relative
to their standards, cheap in relation to what the casettes cost in New
York), especially when in some countries, food and other basic staples
are hard to get.  This adulation from young men in Bulgaria and other
former Soviet-bloc countries for heavy metal is probably for the same
reason the groups enjoy wide support from young people here -
rebellion against repressive establish- ment.  The only difference is
the youth in Eastern Europe had a far more repressive establishment,
less accessibility to outlets other than the "Party line" and more
incentive to rebel than their counterparts in the West.  Since the
overthrow of Communist regimes in Eastern Europe, the economies of
these countries have been in a mess, something we seem to vel be
ignoring as we watch CNN cover the Persian Gulf.  One wonders if those
young men from Eastern Europe who are writing viruses are trying to
get our attention?

I have received no reply from Budapest about the POLIMER virus and am
wondering if that sentence was in Magyar.  Could somebody on the net be
of help here.

Subject: MSDOS viruses (PC)

Hi there,
a question just to point out how things are.  Suppose the following
scenario:

Given an MSDOS machine with an infected HARD DISK (no matter what
kind of virus it is), and a sane floppy disk, I do the following:

1) Boot with a sane floppy disk;
2) SYS C:
	boot sector, IBMBIO.SYS, IBMDOS.SYS and COMMAND.COM
	are restored from the sane disk.
3) REN C:\CONFIG.SYS C:\CONFIN.OLD
4) REN C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT C:\AUTOEXEC.OLD
	avoid any infected driver/utility/whatever be called at
	startup
5) Reboot from the hard disk.

At this point, am I sure that the virus cannot be installed in
the PC, and that I can execute the 'internal' DOS commands ?

	Thanks
Luigi Rizzo

Yes, I have observed a similar incident when F-FCHK came across
VSHIELD.EXE (We are licensed for McAfee also).  I have reported this
anomoly to frisk - he is aware of this problem.
