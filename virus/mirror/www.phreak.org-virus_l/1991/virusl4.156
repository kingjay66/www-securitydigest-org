VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: Infections: PC vs MAC

In the population that I follow the PCs outnumber the MACs by about
10-1 yet the incidence of reported infections seems about equal (in
both cases this refers to viruses detected by anti-viral software that
has not infected the target machine).

To base any opinion on the different number of viruses on the two
platforms (successful viruses are something else) is flawed because it
is much easier to write a PC virus than a MAC, all of the tools necessary
come with a PC and are explained. On the other hand, the internals of a
MAC take some digging and are not nearly as well documented.

Next, while in the PC world, programs written in 1981 are still
executable on any manufacturer's 486 Tower running DOS 5.0, on the
Apple side in the same time span we have the Apple III, Lisa, MAC 128.
Consider that the BRAIN (still infecting a significant number of PCs)
was written in 1986 and then name the 1986 Apple software packages
that will still run without modification under system 7.

Finally, while the $1000 PC has been around for a while, until the MAC
"classic" came out, low priced MACs were not plentiful, nor was there
the incredible diversity of programs available.

Therefore, IMHO, the reasons for the "low" number of MAC viruses stem
from differences in design philosophy that are not necessarily
strengths.

Personally, I do not care for GUIs but recognize the attractiveness to
those who do not really want to know or care exactly what is
happening. However, often I work on Unix-based systems such as an
Apollo or Sun workstation (also primarilly Motorola 680x0 based but
moving toward RISCs), and my question is: "How does Apple make it run
so slow ?".

Subject: Flash EPROM BIOS (PC)

I received a catalog in the mail today from a popular mail order vendor.  As
I was browsing the pages dream shopping for components to build the ultimate
home system, my eyes caught the following text:

	"The `Ugly Duckling' 486/33E includes another new technological
	advance - flash EPROM BIOS.  The EISA flash EPROM is electrically
	reprogrammable ROM which allows for in-circuit reprogramming.
	With this new technology the end-user can upgrade the system
	board BIOS without disassembling the system, simply by using a
	floppy disk."

This subject was discussed a few months ago.  I just wonder who will
make it to the BIOS first, the good guys or the bad guys?

P.S. I didn't receive much response from a recent posting on LANs and
     viruses.  I'm curious to know if there is a lack of interest in
     the subject, or a lack of experience.

I rarely see complaints that virus scanning is a non-specific approach.
Seriously, the reason that vendors use identification strings is that it
is *easy*; id (or search) strings are easy to extract, easy to transmit
and share, it's easy to write efficient scanners for search strings,
etc. Search strings also happen to be compact (at least relative to the
size of most of the viruses that they detect).  Precise identification
doesn't require much more space per virus, but it does require a
complete analysis of each virus to be reliable.  The virus needs to be
mapped, the constant extents in the virus need to be determined, a
degarbler functionally identical to the virus degarbler may need to be
written, etc.

I can speak to the IBM VIRSCAN; the detection goals are (a) minimizing
the number of false positives, (b) maximizing the probability that a
variant of a known virus will be detected, and (c) minimizing the number
of false negatives, all while keeping performance reasonable.  Notice
that goal (a) conflicts with goals (b) and (c).  Admittedly, we're
trying to work wonders with short search strings, but this is at least
partly a result of the necessity for the use of a compact virus
description, due to the numbers of PC viruses in circulation (at least
among collectors :). There's certainly room for improvement; search
strings are a rather primitive identification mechanism.

Note that Alan Solomon's Toolkit (which you don't mention) does do a
verification for most of the viruses that it detects.  I expect we'll
see more scanners doing verification as the industry matures, and
liability issues may force vendors to make their tools do a complete
verification before disinfecting.

According to the LOADHI utility from QEMM386 V5.13, my copy of VSHIELD V80
has a run-time size of 500k when memory checking is enabled, and a run-time
size of 111k with the /NOMEM switch. The resident size on my machine (NCR
PC386sx, 5.3MB RAM, DOS 5.0) is 34720.  The run-time size is the minimum
amount of contiguous high memory required to load the program high.  In
other words, while you may have a "high" region that has 35k, if you don't
have the required room for the initial program load, you won't be able to
load it high.  I don't know about anyone else, but I certainly don't have
100k of free high memory by the time AUTOEXEC is processed.  Further, I run
VSHIELD with the /M and /CHKHI switches, to see if any nasties have loaded,
so the loadhigh option is not available.  As a side note, I have
successfully loaded F-DRIVER from F-PROT, as well as VWATCH and VSAFE from
CPAV, into high memory.

Hope this helps.

I have a question (probably asked earlier but I was not here). Is NAV
known for finding AIDS virus in error? I recall seeing this
- -somewhere- but cannot find reference. This information would help me
restore peace of mind (or utter terror) to the mind of a local sysop.
Thanks for any info.

Subject: McAfee question (PC)

We are currently evaluating the McAfee anti-virus program.  Specifically,
I know that the Norton TSR will detect infected files as they are being
copied.  Is there any way to get the McAfee TSR to do this?  I've been
testing with ver. 8.0 and had used VSHIELD and VSHIELD1.

Anyone done side-by-side testing of both Norton and McAfee?  What are
your impressions?

Several people have informed me of a conflict between VIRSTOP.EXE (a
part of version 2) and MIRROR from Central Point Software.

This will be corrected in version 2.01, but until then don't load both
programs at the same time.

A few notes on Scan v80.
- ------------------------

We had someone come in the other day with a disk infected with the
Keypress virus, the infected files had been renamed to .BAD.

So I renamed them to .COM and scanned them, no virus.  When we checked
they were .EXE files, so we renamed them and guess what, scan found the
keypress virus.

Would someone like to pass this on to Mc.Afee before this technique for
hiding virii (viruses, whatever the convention is) by renaming files gets
used, if it hasn't been already.  COM files will still run when renamed as
.EXE and vice versa.

The infection recurred on the hard drive and was eventually tracked down
to one of XtGold 2's overlay files.  Scan apparently doesn't scan these
files correctly.  The file was XTG_EDIT.XTG.

Subject: Hard Disk Locking (PC)

This is NOT a commercial solicitation.  But, after noting the recent
exchanges on preventing unintentional writes to PC hard disks I
thought it appropriate to share some of our efforts in this area.
Many Navy users need to process sensitive data but don't want it
ending up on their system's hard disk where it would be accessable to
unauthorized parties.  For this reason we developed the Write Protect
Switch System (WPSS) for our installed base of 85,000+ PC's using
ST506 compatible disk drives.  (As a side benefit it also limits the
spread of viruses).

The WPSS contains a PC board, external five position switch,
associated cables, and PROM software.  WPSS protects two floppy and
two hard drives by interupting the "write gate".  The PROM software
traps attempted writes to protected disks and flags the BIOS/DOS error
routines.  The PROM also contains security officer configuarable
routines which can lock-out floppy boots, write protect specified
files, log users, and audit their activity.

Twenty-five systems are in test and production is scheduled to begin
in December.  US Government agencies interested in WPSS are encouraged
to contact us for further information.

There are several products which only rely on published search
strings, but they are not very secure - virus writers have access to
the same search patterns and they often modify their viruses so they
will not be detected by those patterns.

Yes, if it indeed uses the patterns included in the virus simulator -
but how can you know if it does ?

You cannot - which is another reason why the "virus simulator" is an
useless program.

Yes, I am - and that is no secret.

I also maintain that it is advisable to use a couple of scanners,
which use different set of patterns (or a single scanner using two
different sets), as it increases the chances of detecting real-world
viruses.  Frankly, however I don't care if my scanner detects the
"simulated" viruses - but I find it extremely annoying when the author
of the program claims it should.
