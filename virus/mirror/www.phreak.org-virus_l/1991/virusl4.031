Subject: Naming/Identifying new viruses (PC)

There is a continual problem with people finding what seems to be a
new virus, but not wishing to broadcast the whole (dangerous) boot
sector to identify it.  I have a solution to the identification
problem:

I have devised a "hashcode" algorithm specially designed for boot
sectors, that gives a reasonably short (12-character) code (of A-Z,
0-9, '#' and '.')  that pretty well uniquely identifies a boot sector,
is very difficult for virus writers to get around, and is useful in
its own right (i.e. you can look at the code and get a reasonable idea
of what the boot sector is like).

I can let anyone have the source to this (knowing the source doesn't
help virus writers), and I'm happy to make it public domain - in fact
I hope many people adopt the same standard encoding system.  For that
reason, I suggest some discussion of the format and method before it
is used in a serious way.

Briefly, what I have done is to generate code which is...
(1) able to be passed through e-mail systems, etc without distortion
(2) cannot be used to recreate a live virus
(3) is a valid DOS filename, and short enough to say over the telephone easily
(4) always starts with the same character, "#", so people can immediately
    recognise it as a hashcode
(5) has a built-in check against typos (including transposition errors), and
    avoids case distinction or confusing characters (like "/" and "\")
(6) is reasonably easy to calculate
(7) generates the same code on all systems (e.g. no floating point arithmetic
    subject to round-off error or different formats on different systems)
(8) includes four (and a half) bytes of high-order polynomial checksum, making
    it difficult for virus writers to give a bad boot sector the same code as
    a good one. (It would involve very lengthy trial-and-error methods)
(9) The last bytes include bit flags, indicating the presence of dubious code
    of various types, and the absence of important features (such as a reboot),
    making it useful in itself, and making it even harder for virus writers to
    circumvent!
(10)The size of messages and null bytes and code are also taken into account,
    since more sneaky viruses will need more code than a good boot sector, so
    encrypted boot sector viruses would have a tough time getting past!!
(11)DOS 4 diskettes (with serial numbers) get the same hashcode, irrespective
    of serial number (except in a small number of cases, where the serial numbe
r
    happens to contain forbidden instructions).
(12)Minor variations of the same virus get similar hashcodes (the last 3 bytes
    and first 3 bytes should be the same or close).

The code is not...
A sure-fire way of indicating the presence of a virus. You could
simply look at the last byte of the code, and if it isn't '0' than it
is probably a virus. Not a great check, but old viruses (including
Stoned) are easy to spot that way. Or you could have a list of known
good and bad boot sectors, and ring alarms when it isn't a good disk.
But that isn't really the aim. It is intended to identify boot
sectors, so somebody can say "I know that disk"... whether you are
describing the disk over the net or over the phone.

I can send the program, BOOTID.PAS to anyone interested via e-mail;
hopefully it, and it's big brother (CHECKOUT.EXE) will soon be
available via anonymous ftp.

Subject: Report for virus trackers (PC)

I remember that several months ago a new system for reporting virus
occurrences was established.  I apologize that I cannot remember what
the reporting procedure was; so I am sending my information to the
list.

Starting at the very end of January we (IUPUI Indiana University -
Purdue University at Indianapolis) have had scads of virus activity.
I am amazed at the number of new (that is new to us) viruses we have
had reported on campus.  In fact, in that short time we have have more
reports of "new" DOS viruses than the TOTAL number of new viruses we
had ever had reported. We have been keeping a log of newly reported
infections for about 2 years.

Some of the reports were made by our student consultants who work in
our open computer clusters and other from various "isolated"
departments.  Our undergraduate campus is shared with a medical school
and a law school.

The following are FIRST time reports of viruses on our campus:
          (The time frame is from January 25th to February 18th.)
Joshi
Music Bug
Yankee Doodle
Stoned

Scan72 was the virus checker used to find the above mentioned
virueses.  We continue to find Mac viruses as well but no new ones
have reached us.

Our open clusters have been undergoing major upgrades.  For instance
this semester marks the first time when we have had Hard Drives
available.  I cannot draw a definite link with the upgrades and the
flourish of new (and old viruses) but I do find it coincidental.

Subject: McAfee ProScan ineffective? (PC)

I have been using McAfee's SCAN/CLEAN V72 for quite some time with
good success.  I recently discovered an "end-user" version with a nice
screen interface, etc. called ProScan (also by McAfee) which is
supposed to perform the same functions as SCAN/CLEAN.  I have found,
however, the following problems:

     1.  ProScan does not scan system memory for viruses (even though
         documentation says it should)
     2.  ProScan does not test both boot sector AND partition table
         for viruses
     3.  Even with the library of 200+ viruses, ProScan does not
         detect even older viruses such as Stoned or Jerusalem,
         while SCAN/CLEAN V72 find them immediately, whether they
         exist in the boot sector, partition table, data area, or
         even in memory.

The version of ProScan is the latest commercial offering which was
made available (for retail sale to customers) to a computer
store/service department which I work for part time.

Any thoughts?

Tom

Truly interesting, if this is 100% true - but I doubt it.  It is easy
to add code to programs and boot sectors which will detect infection
by 98% of currently known viruses - all the 400 or so known variants,
other than a few "stealth" viruses.

Adding code which PREVENTS something from being infected is an
entirely different story - what if the computer is booted from a
floppy and some infected program run ?  No additions to other
programs, no matter how sophisticated could prevent the programs from
being infected.  The additional code MIGHT detect the infection, but
as I said before, detection and prevention are two different things.

Subject: Hungarian anti-virus companies.

I hope somebody on the net has information on the anti-virus scene in
Hungary, as I am trying to determine if the companies there are
trustworthy or not.

I understand one of the companies there is Azsio-Microtrade Ltd. Co.,
a German-Hungarian joint venture. I have been told that Ralf Burger
works on the German side, and if this is true, it is sufficient for me
to refuse to cooperate with them in any way whatsoever.  Can anybody
confirm this ?  The no.1 guy in the Hungarian part of the company is
Szegedi Imre, but he has been making various accusations against the
other company, Ferenc Leitold and other folks at the University of
Budapest.

Can anyone clarify what is going on there ?

Just a quick warning on something that I haven't seen here, if it was
here please excuse it....

According to the latest SCAN (V74B), there has been a SCANV73 going
around.  This is a TROJAN!!!  Just be on the lookout for it...  And
watch for the PKZIP verification shell to make sure you have something
authentic when you unpack it.

I have Virscan ver. 1.23.  I did dial into IBMLink to see if I could
find version 1.3.  I learned two things... #1) It was very hard to
find.  I could not locate it in any of the software catalogs or the
announcement letters, etc.  I finally found it in the Bulletin Board,
burried a few pages deep (the last release seems to have been a while
back) - and #2) It indicated that this was version 1.2 of the program
(I myself have 1.23 - maybe they just don't indicate minor revs -
possible because they still mark DOS 4.01 boxes as 4.0.)  The program
can be obtained online (electronically) by using the "fastpath" name
ESD (Electronic Software Distribution) which should have a list of
files that can be downloaded (for a cost) - you're supposed to send a
check to IBM after downloading (I guess).  The cost is $35 if you're
getting it for the first time, or $10 if your just updating an old
copy.

This leaves me back at square 1.  Unless their documentation is wrong,
I *have* the most current version.  Are you sure you have version 1.3?
Also there is no mention of getting more signatures (I think this is
all I *really* need.)

I haven't looked at other virus scanners, but I imagine most are set
up to allow users to add more signatures as they learn of them.
(otherwise they'd become obsolete pretty quick).  Is ANYBODY aware of
a source for virus signatures (specifically IBM-PC (DOS))??

All of the listed virus sites are indicated by internet addresses.
This is of course completely useless to people who are not on the
internet.  Is anybody aware of dial-up access for any of these sites?

Any help is greatly appreciated.  I'm sure there are others who would be
equally interested in this info.

Subject: New Version 74B of McAfee's SCAN (PC)

Hello!

Recently I got the new version 74B of SCAN. When I enter

          SCAN C:

with C: being a 40MB Tandon DataPac that has 1K-Sectors, SCAN reported
that the partition table size was too large to be processed, and it
stopped all further checking of the files. The previous version 72
also complained "Sorry, I cannot read the partition table", but at
least it continued checking the files. When I tried

          SCAN C:\*.*

it scans all files in the root directory, but does not recurse into
the subdirectories. Anyone who knows a way to make it work on the
whole disk?

Subject: Viruses in the USSR

This is my paper on the situation with viruses in the USSR.
It was written in october-november of 1990, so there are
some notes to it:
1)It does not names all viruses in the SU, but this number
  is NOT too high. Maybe there are a couple of dozens, not more.
  If you'd got an information about hundred and more viruses
  in the USSR, don't beleive it !
2)Vienna (648) virus is dated by 1987 there. I don't know how
  it could be and where is a bug but three my friends independently
  points out to 1987 as a first time of our problems with
  this virus. This is the reason why I've left out this date
  in the paper, though ALL other sourcers points out to the 1988.

I try to make who-is-who in our field so I am interested in
names, adresses, fields of interests of antiviral researchers
all over the world. Another (and ORIGINAL) reason for this
interest is that I am writing (and modifing) the book devoted
to the problems connected with the different badware. I don't
want to make a catalog, but a textbook for students and future
antiviral researchers. It is going concurrently with a research
work, so I'm interested to discuss different ideas as wide as
possible.

VERSION 74-B
	Version 74-B fixes a bug which caused the programs misidentify
the Swedish Disaster virus on Syquest 10Mb tape drives and machines
formatted with some versions of Zenith-OEM MS-DOS.  The machines in
question were said to have the "Stoned/Swedish Virus" present in the
boot sector of infected hard disks and disk packs.

VIRUSCAN Version 74
     Version 74 of VIRUSCAN adds 51 new viruses and over one
hundred new strains of existing viruses, bringing the total number
of known computer viruses to 475.  In addition, version 74 improves
the throughput of the scanning algorithm and handling of
nonstandard hard drives, and now provides the option of displaying
all messages in French.
     The 1575/1591 virus was sent to us from multiple sites in
Quebec, Canada, Oslo, Norway, and the United States.  It is a
memory-resident file infector that attaches to .COM and .EXE files
when a disk is accessed via internal DOS commands.
     The 903 virus was sent to us by Djennad Nasser from France.
It is a .COM file infector.
     The Holocaust virus was sent to us by David Llamas of
Barcelona, Spain.  It is a .COM file infector that uses "stealth"
type techniques.
     The BeBe, Kuka, Kuka/Turbo, Lozinsky, MGTU, Nina, Off Stealth,
Polish-532, Sverdlov, Tiny-133, USSR-series, and Voronezh viruses
were discovered in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and sent to
us from numerous sources there and in Western Europe.  They are not
believed to exist in the West.
     The Christmas Violator, F-Word, Parity, Beeper, Best Wish,
Leapfrog Destructor, Happy New Year Hymm, Justice, Label, V961,
Swiss-143, Sentinel, Plague, Monxla-B, Little Pieces, IKC528,
Hybrid, Dir-Vir, Stone90, Saddam, and Iraqui Warrior viruses were
sent to us from various sources around the globe.
     For summary information about these viruses, please refer to
the enclosed VIRLIST.TXT file.  For a detailed description of all
known viruses, please refer to the Virus Summary Document (VSUM),
copyrighted by Patricia Hoffman and available and most bulletin
boards.
     A trojan version of VIRUSCAN, Version 73, appeared on BBSes
in Miami, Florida USA.  In order to prevent confusion, we have used
the next version number, Version 74.

CLEAN-UP Verison 74
     Version 74 of CLEAN-UP adds removal of the 1575/1591 and the
Music Bug viruses, as well as several new variants of the Jerusalem
virus.  For more information about these viruses, please refer to
the enclosed VIRLIST.TXT file.

VSHIELD Version 74
      Two new commands have been added to VSHIELD:  The /CONTACT
option allows a custom message to be displayed if a virus is found.
The /CERTIFY option provides control over file execution.  It will
prevent any program from being executed if it has not been
validated as an authorized program for a given site.

FOREIGN LANGUAGE SUPPORT
     Both VIRUSCAN and CLEAN-UP can now display messages in French.
When the /FR option is specified, all messages will be displayed
in French instead of English.

VIRLIST.TXT ENTRY FOR 1575/1591 VIRUS
     Version 74 went out without an entry in the VIRLIST.TXT file
for the 1575/1591 virus.  The correct entry should be:

1575/1591  [15xx]          Clean-Up    . . x x x x . . . .    vary   O,P,L
