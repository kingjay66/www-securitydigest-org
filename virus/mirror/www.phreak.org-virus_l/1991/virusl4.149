Well, I've got a 12.5Mb disk drive with a write-protect switch. It
also has a switch that (from memory) makes either the hard disk or the
floppy drive the bootable drive. Apart from the fact that it is a 19"
rack-mounting monstrosity, and designed to run on a Data General
minicomputer, I'd be happy to sell it to you ;-)

Seriously, how come modern manufacturers *uninvent* features that were
presnt on minicomputers a decade or two ago?? I am interested in
security, not only against viruses and fiddling, but against
breakdown; it seems that old ideas of dual porting and watchdog timers
and so on have gone, yet the need for them is at least as great.

When the computer was in one, big room, it was easy to make it
physically secure and control its environment. The present discussion
of "absolute security" being impossible with software-only measures,
although having some merit, should consider the difficulty in
attaining such high ideals in the typical pc workplace. A
write-protect switch, or a card that can be removed, is not absolute
protection, and people should not be given any false sense of
security. If you know the situation well enough, you might be able to
say that such things are "good enough" - but in some situations a
software-only solution might also be good enough. I agree that
hardware solutions are basically better, of course, and they should be
built into the hardware rather than provided as add-ons, but it is
important to avoid crediting hardware solutions with too much security
when anyone could lift the lid and flick a switch or replace a card.

In the mean time, the best way to stop anyone putting a virus on your
computer is to stick a write-protect tab on the magnetic surface of
the hard disk drive.  Okay, it stops *all* accesses to the disk, and
the surface is ruined when you take the tab off, but it is *absolute*
protection! ;-)

Subject: CPAV + SCAN conflict (PC)

I was testing the CentralPoint Anti Virus package (CPAV) and found an
interesting interaction with McAfee SCAN.  If I run the full TSR in
the CPAV package, VSAFE, then they get along OK.  But if I run the
faster and simpler, VWATCH, then SCAN v80 complains about the
Pakistani/Brain virus being in memory.  I suspect this is a false
alarm from VWATCH holding in memory the patterns it is looking for
when programs run, and SCAN finds them.  I spent an hour checking my
entire system the first time I got that message.

Actually, this last sentence is not *quite* true.  You *cannot* make a
software mechanism "arbitrarily strong" in the mathematician's sense -
this is an outcome of Godel's Theorem and the Turing Halting Problem.
Interested readers are referred to Hofstaeder's "Godel, Escher, Bach"
- - in particular, the sections of the Dialogues dealing with record
players and records that destroy them....

However, it *should* be noted that any "attack software" capable of
mounting a Godelian attack on a system would most probably be well
past the point of "economic return"...  So it is *quite* possible to
create a software mechanism that is "strong enough to resist any
plausible threat in production usage".

You are damn right, absolutely damn right.  That is the
way to write it and it seems close to impossible to detect.
That is how I wrote mine.

aside ----

remeber the big Internet Crash?

At the time it happened, I had just written such a program for Chevron
who hired me to demonstrate that no cracker could get in.  Instead, I
kept claiming that they were wide open.  So I wrote such a program,
and ran it on isolated ``secure'' systems to tell them that they had a
real damn actual problem here, and hiring me to cover it up wouldn't
work....

Bingo.  TV coverage of the Internet crash happens after I come home
from a theatre evening, and my first thought was, holy shit, this was
not what I was promised, an isolated non-internet community, and my
problem has spread to the whole damn Internet.  Oh hell! They will
barbq me and maybe jail me... oh shit....

And I phone around and discover that it is another, more simple minded
problem.

And life goes on, I convince Chevron, I get paid, all is happy....  I
needed to write a virus in order for them to see that they had a
problem.  But I trusted them that their machines were isolated.  I got
lucky, that was true.

But that is pure luck.

If you ever get to write a virus for a company make damn certain that
it is off the internet before you go to work.

I lucked out.

Don't make that mistake.

Under the laws of the United States and many of the states within it,
viruses are illegal for exactly the reason stated - the alter the data
or programs of others.

Further comments about viruses being the just deserts of pirates are
ill informed at best. Many many people have been harmed by viruses
without being pirates. In any case punishment for copyright violation
is a matter for the courts not "progammmer-vigilantes"

You are indeed correct.  I was answering in the same context as I
percieved the question to have been asked - that of keeping an
"average" user from "borrowing" the system.  My brother proved to me
that someone who knows what he's doing can circumvent it in well under
an hour (I think he got in - actually booting from the HD - in about 12
minutes or so...), however, I run a 165 user LAN & it stops them *all*
dead in their tracks...  Good enough for the intended purpose.

Yes, I should be much more careful about using words like "can't" in a
conference that attracts so many technically proficient people.  (When
I was working as a machinist the easiest way to get a project out of me
was to insinuate that I couldn't do it with the equipment at hand...!)

Chastisement accepted constructively...

The IBM Virus Scanning Program can do that: "VIRSCAN -MEM" to scan
only memory for only the dangerous viruses, or "VIRSCAN -MEM -G" to
scan only memory for all viruses.

An interesting point. The manufacturers would certainly be upset if
this person were to distribute a) illegal, and b) infected copies of
their software. If he contributed to the safer use of the
manufacturers software through his having an infected copy, I think it
quite unlikely that they would charge him with copyright infringement.

Copyrighted viruses?! Actually, the sort of person who gets his
jollies inflicting the rest of the world with his ego, just _might_ be
stupid enough to try to charge those infected with having illegal
copies. It would make an interesting plot for a novel, but I don't
think we'll see it in the news.

Subject: Re: Ghosting

    A few previous postings have talked about the "ghosting"
effect some scanners cause: false positives because of remnants
of viruses on disk or in memory.  I had an interesting experience
with this effect recently.

    At U of Alberta we have been installing DiskSecure and FPROT
in all our computer labs.  When we added an "f-disinf" line to
our autoexec.bat file, a couple computers reported an infection
by the Empire virus, on boot-up.  This seemed odd, since DiskSecure
was already in place, and CHKSEC had reported that DiskSecure was
working ok.  On inspection, we found that what we were seeing was
a ghost effect:

    DiskSecure was in its proper place in sector 1.  DiskSecure
had properly copied the "real" partition table to its favorite hiding
places.  But these couple stations previously had had an infection by
the empire virus, and the main partition table had been rebuilt (months
ago) using Norton Disk Doctor.  NDD puts the partition table code and
error statements into place, and builds the table, but leaves the
remaining bytes of the sector (almost half the sector) unchanged.  So
the remnants of Empire were still to be seen in these remaining bytes.

     On boot-up, DiskSecure was working, so when f-disinf asked to see
the main partition table, DiskSecure showed it (using stealth) the
"clean" main partition table, which still had a few remnants of
the Empire virus in it.  My complements to Frisk: f-disinf caught these
remnants (despite the fact most of them were randomly encrypted) and
recognised an "infection" present.

     A ghosting error like that is one I am quite willing to live with. It
suggests Frisk is using a good scan string. And it re-affirms Padgett's
continual contention, that general users should use virus detection tools
to trigger a warning, then get competent technical help in to do the
testing / clean-up.  Third observation you might have made: using
"f-disinf c:" in the autoexec.bat on a DiskSecure-protected computer
is not terribly useful, given DiskSecure's "stealth" techniques.  Except
maybe for finding this kind of a ghosting effect!

Subject: Preventing boot from floppy - problem with Int 13 from TSR (PC)

Having finally found some free time, I started looking at a "kill
floppy boots" TSR. The criteria was to:
     1: Trap cntrl-alt-del sequence
     2: Check for floppy in drive A:
     3: Disallow boot if floppy in drive
     4: Provide separate mechanism for a maintenance floppy boot
        (cntrl-alt-F)

The code itself is not difficult and takes up about 800 bytes  as
a TSR (0 impact with DiskSecure) but I ran into a glitch with the
floppy detection sequence. The code used looks like this:
(see Ray Duncan's BIOS book in the description of INT 13 fn 04)

     MOV SI, 0003   ;try three times
LP1: MOV AX, 0401   ;verify one sector
     MOV CX, 0001   ;sector 1, head 0
     MOV DX, 0000   ;track 0, drive 0 (BR floppy A)
     INT 13
     JNC XXX        ;NC = floppy in drive. C = access failed
     DEC SI         ;(try three times with reset before each retry)
     JZ  YYY        ;ZR = assume no floppy in drive
     XOR AX,AX      ;reset drive
     INT 13
     JMP LP1

(code simplified for readability but does the essentials).

The problem is that this works just fine when run as  a .COM  but
as  soon  as it is installed TSR & invoked  from  a  ctrl-alt-del
sequence, it runs bog sloooow & is not always accurate. This  was
reproducable  both  on  an 8088/DOS 3.3 and a  386/DOS  5.0.  The
question  is,  does anyone know why & how to fix ?  I  know  that
eventually  a  workaround can be found but can't spend a  lot  of
time  on it. Once the One True Answer is found, the TSR  will  be
posted as FreeWare.
							Padgett

386 the .COM runs in 1-3 seconds. When TSR  it takes 10-13
    seconds. I assume (you know what that  means) that some  kind
    of additional setup is necessary & done by DOS for a .COM
ps: thought  of floppy door flag but it is not necessarily set or
    universally used.
