Subject: SCAN hangs while checking Window's SOL.EXE file (PC)

Has anyone had problems with SCANV77?  When I scan my hard drive, the
program hangs on one particular file, SOL.EXE, Window's solitaire
program.  I don't have problems with running the game and SCAN doesn't
have problems with any other file.  In order to continue, I have to
press 'F' to accept the failure.  Does anyone know why this is
happening?

*This problem is of course not unique to F-PROT - every other scanner
*has this same problem.  In fact, the DOS 'COPY' command can also cause
*a similar effect - infection of files when they are read.  Is it a
*design flaw in DOS ?

	Amazing!  You totally missed the point sir.  Neither DOS, nor
any of its utility programs (the ones that come with DOS) make any
claims for being capable of dealing with viruses.  In that regard, the
criticism does not apply to them.  F-PROT and FluShot+ (1.81) are
full-blown, widely-used ANTI-VIRAL packages.  If DOS etc. could have
handled the problem, we would not have been unfortunate enough to
shell out more bucks to feel secure from viruses.

*So - with the current generation of scanners, this problem cannot be
*avoided.

	Not at all.  I have seen at least one beta-test version of a
new product that does not suffer from the mentioned problems.  Because
of an agreement, I am not allowed to say more on this.  But, it will
be available in the near future according to the developers.

Comparative Modern Culture 101, final exam
Question 5:  Who is "Eddie"?  (10 points)

You would have a great time going through the old issues researching
this one.  I think the Heavy Metal crew have one the day on this one.
"Eddie" is the mascot of "Iron Maiden", one of whose
albums/songs/lines is "somewhere in time".

Subject: Follow-up to Certus LAN review (PC)

I got a call from Certus today.  I got *two* calls from Certus today.
Even before I had seen my review "in print".

A couple of items to note.  The version I received was 2.0, 2.1 is now
out and has some changes.  The scanning portion has been increased in
speed.  The documentation is apparently unchanged except for the
installation section.  Apparently even BOOTLOCK does not prevent
infection by the Stoned virus.  (A disinfection package to deal with
the problem is now in beta test.)

I will aparently be receiving an updated copy soon, and will send out a
new review when complete.

Somewhat related, and pursuant to Ross's anecdote: In my seminars i
have found that the Stoned virus is more "successful" (in terms of
number of people infected) than all other viral programs combined.  So
far ...

Padgett:  We must sue the vendors!

Well, apologies to Sholem Aleichim and everyone else concerned, but there
probably isn't any real disagreement here, it's more a matter of
differing perspectives.

I've had (too) numerous occasions where I've sent a computer owner back
to the vendor because of problems with a virus on a new system, only to
have the vendor admit it, admit that he (or she) *knew* about a virus
loose in the shop, and didn't do anything about it.

On one occasion I reported a potential virus to the software
manufacturer.  This particular company has a very small "core" staff, and
yet I kept getting calls back from the company for a week, pointing
fingers in all directions, before they would even agree to check their
software.  (After they agreed to do that, I heard nothing more.  An
admission of guilt?)

The above number isn't accessible from the Montreal (514) callling area.

The local Packard Bell distributor readily gave me (800)-263-0089 for
Technical Support. I called this number and got someone named Morris,
who explained that the virus had come from a subcontractor who had
reproduced Packard's diskettes.  Said subcontractor was "severely
reprimanded", according to Morris.

Those having virus problems on Packard Bell are encouraged to call the
above number. Packard seemed to think the problem was solved last
winter. Perhaps the recent sightings are due to diskettes remaining in
storage for 6 months or so.

These files sound like the checksum files created by the
auto-inoculate feature of the Norton Antivirus package.  They are
77-bytes in length and are created with the system and hidden file
attributes.

If it was hidden .COM files for each .EXE, then it would indicate the
new type of viral programs which Patricia Hoffman refers to as
"spawning".  However, since the hidden files do not have executable
filenames, it might be similar to the Norton Antivirus change
detection scheme.

NAV does not store all the checksum information for "innoculated"
files in one file, but in one hidden file for each innoculated
program.  The checksum files have filenames related to the program
files, but one character in the extension is altered.

Sorry not to have more details, but I can't find the specifics in the
manual.  (Thinks: what are READ.ME files for?  Sure enough.)

Yes, in the READ.ME file, you will find (at about line 125) a
description of the checksum files it creates.  For .COM it is ._OM,
for .EXE, ._XE, for .SYS, ._YS etc.

Norton's AntiVirus made all of those files.  They were checksums(or
something like that) of those .EXE and .COM files.  If you look there
should be ._VL files too.  You just killed Norton's protection scheme.
Hope you aren't still using that.

Oh!  I see now.  Anybody know where I can get six bytes worth of
integrity checking, cheap?

A simple problem was posted to the mailing list, and it'll be fixed in
my code shortly and, I would presume, in frisk's code, too.  By
stating that you "get what you pay for", I would presume that you're
advising both frisk and me to raise our rock bottom prices?

Subject: Virus cheking of archives from a batch (PC)

Sun 12-May-91: I have updated my collection of useful batch files to
be /pc/ts/tsbat25.arc.
   One of the constant worries of downloaders of archived packages
is the threat of viruses. (Games from shady BBSes are particularly
susceptibe, but even commercial products have been known to be
infected). Fortunately there are good virus checkers like McAfee's
/pc/virus/scanv77.zip and Fridrik Skulason's /pc/virus/fp-115a.zip
available to check for infections. There are, however, two dilemmas
in checking archived packages on a routine basis. (Since the format
garbo.uwasa.fi archives mostly uses is .zip let's speak of zipped
files). The first problem is that there are so many executable
compressors in use currently (such as lzexe, pklite, diet, tinyprog,
etc). This means that unless the virus checking programs can observe
all these variations, a virus can be hiding in an execompressed
form. Therefore it is advisable to expand the executables for the
check. A second problem is that .zip files occasionally contain
embedded .zip files (eg PC-Magazine's collections often do). These
embedded .zip files must be unzipped for a closer examination.
   The earlier versions of the tsbat collection included a batch
called scanzip.bat. I have completely rewritten this batch to take
care of the two eventualities discussed above. I have renamed the
rewritten batch scanz.bat. Note that before using this new batch,
you have to go through scanz.bat and edit all the directory path
references to correspond to your own configuration. This is, of
course, an inconvenience, but it is the best way of guaranteeing
that a batch complicated as this stays reasonably efficient.
   The /ts/pc/tsbat25.arc package is available from garbo.uwasa.fi
and SIMTEL20 archives.

Subject: Gatekeeper 1.2 Release Announcement (Mac)

Gatekeeper 1.2 and Gatekeeper 1.2 have finally be released.

The complete distribution set will be sent to comp.binaries.mac and
the info-mac archives.  It is immediately available for anonymous ftp
from the following archive sites:

        Machine Name            IP Number
        ------------            ---------
        ix1.cc.utexas.edu	128.83.1.21
        ix2.cc.utexas.edu       128.83.1.29
        bongo.cc.utexas.edu     128.83.186.13

The file is named gatekeeper-12.hqx and is located in the
microlib/mac/virus directory on each of these machines.  This BinHexed
self extracting archive file contains Gatekeeper 1.2, Gatekeeper Aid
1.2 and all associated documen- tation.  Since it is a self extracting
archive file, users of current Gate- keeper versions should place
their copies of Gatekeeper in Override mode before clicking on the
"Gatekeeper 1.2 Distribution.sea" file which be generated by decoding
the gatekeeper-12.hqx BinHex file.

Listed below, in no particular order, is a selection of brief
descriptions of new features in Gatekeeper 1.2 and changes between
version 1.1.1 and 1.2.  This list is by no means complete but should
serve to provide an impression of the scope of the changes to this
version.


*  System 7.0 compatibility.  All other versions of Gatekeeper like to die
   when the File Sharing feature of System 7 is used.  This version cures this
   problem very effectively.

*  The interface has a new look.  Where 1.1.1 supported 3 "screens" (Info,
   Settings and Help), 1.2 supports 6 screens in order to make room for a
   (hopefully) more pleasant and sensible user interface.

*  Gatekeeper's Help display now supports Styled TextEdit in it's System 6.0
   and beyond implementations.  This means that the help text will appear
   nicely formatted in Helvetica, Times and Monaco.  This helps to differen-
   tiate the different sections of the Help display and adds useful emphasis
   throughout.

   Text in the Help display may be selected and copied to the Clipboard so
   it can be pasted into more convenient environments, like word processors.

*  The Gatekeeper control panel now includes a section that allows the user
   to view the log file and to clear the log file when it gets too big.

*  The privilege list is now sorted, and using the Clear button doesn't scroll
   the list back to the first item like it did in 1.1.1.

*  The settings section now includes a check box called "Display a Mode Warn-
   ing Alert".  This check box allows the user to determine whether Gatekeeper
   will display its "Notify Only" alert everytime the Mac boots in Notify
   Only mode.  A "Notify & Veto" alert is also supported now, and the same
   check box regulates whether it appears or not.

*  A "New" button has been added to the privilege list section.  This button
   allows the user to add an item to the privilege list without going through
   all the business with the "Add..." button and the Open dialog box.

*  Some privileges are no longer required.  Programs and INITs that install
   drivers used to need Res(Self) privileges to do so, in many cases.  In most
   cases these programs and INITs no longer need the Res(Self) privilege, so
   most of them have been removed from the default privilege list.

*  Gatekeeper now supports privileges for Control Panel and Chooser documents,
   in addition to privileges for Desk Accessories, Drivers and Applications.

*  Internal Errors are history.  The problem was found and fixed.

*  Gatekeeper no longer crashes Macs while they attempt to switch launch.

*  It is no longer necessary to grant the System 7 Finder Res(Other & Sys)
   privileges in order to move desk accessories around.  Gatekeeper detects
   these cases internally and deals with them very carefully without reference
   to the privilege list.  So, DO NOT grant anything other than File(Other)
   privileges to the Finder.

*  Gatekeeper deals with the bizarre (or, at least, unexplained) RsrcMapEntry
   calls made by the print driver in System 6.0.7 without assistance from
   Gatekeeper Aid.

*  Gatekeeper now allows resources like the infamous Adobe Separator 'ADBS'
   to be added to the Desktop file without any fuss or privilege violations.

*  Gatekeeper will no longer allow an odd value in its 'sysz' 0 resource.
   This will take care of an incredibly rare and obscure source of boot-time
   crashes on some Macs.  Gatekeeper Aid, of course, has been retroactively
   correcting this problem for some time.

*  Since Gatekeeper now allows users to read the Log file from the control
   panel, there's no need to continue locking the Gatekeeper Log file in order
   to make programs like MS Word happy.  The log file is still stored as
   text, though, so users can read it with other prgrams, like their favorite
   spreadsheets, if they so desire.

*  Special keys like the arrow keys, page up/down, and home/end are supported
   where appropriate.

*  StuffIt, Compact Pro (Compactor), and Disk Doubler self extracting archives
   (SEAs) are now fully and transparently supported.  No privileges are necess-
   ary in order for SEAs to do their stuff correctly.

*  When viewing a privilege violation record, a button will be available which
   is labeled "Grant Privilege".  Clicking on the button will cause the program
   listed in the dialog as "Guilty" to be granted the listed privilege.

   If you go to the Privilege section after clicking on the "Grant Privilege"
   button you'll find the "guilty" program selected in the privilege list
   for convenience.  If an entry for that program already existed in the
   privilege list, the new privilege will be added to the existing ones.

*  Items in the privilege list can now be selected by typing the first few
   letters of their names (just like you'd select files and folders in a
   conventional "Open" or "Save As" dialog box).

*  Gatekeeper 1.2 is split into two parts; an INIT (which does the real
   work) and a cdev (which provides the user interface).  In this respect
   it's very similar to the structure of Gatekeeper 2.0.

   There are several reasons for doing this:

   a. Since System 7 installs INITs *before* it installs any cdevs, having
      Gatekeeper continue to be a cdev file would mean that all the INITs
      would install before Gatekeeper and could potentially get around its
      protections as a result.

      Of course, users can explicitly put cdevs in the Extensions folder and
      thereby guarantee that they install at the same time as the INITs,
      but I don't think folks should have to deal with that kind of thing.

   b. Gatekeeper 1.1.1 was large.  1.2 is much larger.  This means that
      it wouldn't stand a chance of fitting on a bootable 800K floppy disk
      as used in many university computer labs, for instance.  By breaking
      it into two parts, the situation is much improved (although even the INIT
      portion of 1.2 is pretty big) since a preconfigured Gatekeeper can be
      placed on those systems without the large cdev.  This leaves Gatekeeper
      fully operational but non-configurable (which is often a desirable
      thing in computer labs and similar environments) and reduces its
      storage requirements from 126K to about 60K.

*  Another difference you'll notice is that there is now a Gatekeeper Prefs
   file.  This file stores all the configuration information for Gatekeeper
   including all the privileges.  There were a number of internal reasons for
   using a separate prefs file, but I think it may be useful to users as well
   since it provides an easy way of moving the configuration data between
   compatible versions of Gatekeeper.

   The Gatekeeper Prefs file will be created from scratch if the need should
   ever arise, but a default Prefs file is provided with an extensive set of
   default privileges already in place, for the convenience of everyone.

*  Gatekeeper, Gatekeeper Controls, Gatekeeper Log, Gatekeeper Prefs and
   Gatekeeper Aid all have color icons.  I hope they qualify as the "spiffy"
   icons people have been asking for for so long.  :-)

*  Gatekeeper Aid is now capable of running properly even when there is no
   free memory available.  This should eliminate once and for all the -108
   errors that have bugged users here and there for so long.

I hope everyone finds it useful.
