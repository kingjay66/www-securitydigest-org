VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

While I have no argument with Rob's explanation of "precedence of
program invocation," I must state that the particular example he
uses is extremely poor.  In the example given, *NONE* of the
executable files listed will be run, as "SET" is an internal
command to MS-DOS.  It, like "DIR," "COPY," "ERASE," etc., will
be interpreted before DOS ever looks on the disk for an executable
file.  In other words, the order of precedence is that internal
commands are first, then .COM files, .EXE files, and .BAT files.

On a related subject, I've noticed a strange quirk of DOS (which
may be confined only to Zenith DOS 3.30 Plus).  If a device driver
is loaded which has an 8-character device name (NOT the file name),
an attempt to run an executable file with that name will result in
a "Bad command or file name" message WITHOUT EVER HAVING ACCESSED
THE DISK.  For example, I was using the CONFIG.CTL device from PC-
Magazine, which identifies itself to DOS as CONFIGURE (which is
truncated to CONFIGUR).  With this loaded, I could no longer run
the Zenith DOS external command CONFIGUR.EXE.  This is only true
for devices which have 8-character names -- 7 characters or less
will not cause this problem.  I don't think viri will ever exploit
this, but it could be useful to know if your machine exhibits this
behavior.  Try running "MS$MOUSE" (if you have a mouse installed)
or "EMMXXXX0" (if you have expanded memory installed), and watch
the drive light.  If nothing happens except that DOS says "Bad
command or file name," then your version of DOS does this too.
Occasionally, maybe for non-block devices, the disk light will
blink on the first try, but later trys will have no disk activity.

  The checksumming program "V-Analyst", by B.R.M., Israel, has been
doing this ever since its release in 1988.  I.e., the authors were
aware of the possibility of companion viruses two years before they
began to appear in the wild.  (They also took measures against two
other possible techniques, which have not yet been exploited, for
infecting without modifying files.)  The checksummer, augmented by a
generic disinfector and extensive network support, has been licensed
to Fifth Generation, which will soon market it under the name
"Untouchable".  (An announcement should be made by FG within a week or
two.)

McAfee fails to remove the Cascade 1701...

I have just downloaded a series of anti-virus prog's from Garbo, and I
also have access to some other programmes. When I found the Cascade
1701 one some of the students' machines, I decided to test these
utilities out. As the Cascade is an old and common virus, to say the
least, it should be no match to the recognized virus programmes - or
so I thought...

All programmes tested was able to detect the virus, but disinfecting
proved to be far more difficult:

Norton AntiVirus 1.0.0 did not even tell me it had failed removing the
                 strains. It just stated "all repairable files cured"
                 and left me to scan them all over again to find that
                 nothing had been fixed at all!

McAfee Clean 84  could not remove the virus, but offered to delete and
                 wipe my infected files.

F-prot 1.15      cured all my infected files after prompting me first.
F-prot 2.00      also cured all infected files without hesitating!!!

I also had to specialized programmes for the Cascade virus;
   FIND1701 which removed the virus successfully, and
   DVIR1701 which "healed" three bytes to stop it from spreading...

I would also like to mentions that I tried the heuristic analysis in
F-prot 2.00, and after analyzing the infected files I was told that
they "almost certainly contained a virus". So, even though this latter
test doesn't say anything about ability to discover new virii, my
conclusion is thanks to Fridrik Skulason who was able to disinfect
my files - and that with a programme that is distributed as freeware.

Finally, I would like a comment from McAfee, how is it possible that
your programme is not able to disinfect such an old and well-known
virus???

Subject: Cascade <---> Yap (same family?) (PC)

Cascade <---> Yap ???

I found some files infected with the Cascade 1701 on some of the
students' machines the other day, and I took the opportunity to test
them against some disinfectors I had at hand (see previous article).

I also tried to copy them using McAfee's VCOPY v.82 - which correctly
identified the Cascade virus. However, VCOPY also claimed to have
found the Yap virus. McAfee's CLEAN v.84 also identified Yap.

This leads to my question:
     What is the relationship between these two???

Fridrik Skulason identifies Yap as a variant of the Cascade virus;
   "only two instructions are switched", and lists it under 1701/1704
   bytes. Patricia Hoffman claims the Yap virus has 6258 bytes. Although
   she mentions its similarities (in encryption technique) to Cascade,
   she does not list them together in her relationship chart.

Vcopy and Clean identified Yap in a file of 2114 bytes (413 wo/Cascade).

Subject: Re: Seeking Info on stoned virus (PC)

The Stoned virus sits in the boot sectors of diskettes and the master
boot records of hard disks (where the partition table is).  When you
boot from an infected disk or diskette, the virus loads into high
memory, and infects diskettes that are used in the A: drive from then
on.  When you boot from an infected floppy, it will infect the hard
disk, and sometimes display the message "Your PC is now stoned!".
That's about it.  Due to a bug in the virus, if your system was last
FDISK'd with DOS 2, the virus will overwrite part of the hard disk FAT
when it infects (it stores the original boot record in what it think
is unused space, but is really part of the FAT).  There are variants
of the virus that will never display the "stoned" message.

Nope.

Actually, it only infects diskettes used in A:.   It works below
the DOS level, and has no concept of a default drive.

No, actually it doesn't do that; I would expect c-a-d to remove it from
memory just fine, but as you say

That's always the safest thing to do.

For those of you who track or correct scanner conflicts, here is
another one.  When Central Point VDEFEND.SYS 7.1 is active in memory
and McAfee ViruScan 7.9v84 is run, ViruScan reports "Israeli Boot
Virus [IBoot] active in memory."  VDEFEND didn't report anything.
Rebooting from a clean floppy and rescanning revealed the truth: a
clean drive.

On the topic of the virus tool review...
I've got the copy of the full report here in front of me...it's quite
comprehensive and well done (author was Stang).  It's worth the
money for those of you who need up-to-date info to make purchasing
decisions (especially for large sites).  One of the other reports
from the National Computer Security Association (NCSA) is on
scanners...same principle involved, different products.  Aslo high

John:
There is a movement under way right now to address your concerns.  On
November 25 and 26 of this year, the National Computer Security Association
(NCSA) will sponsor the First International Anti-Virus Product
Developer's Conference.  All anti-virus developers are invited to attend.
The main focus of the conference will be (1) to reach a consensus in support
of resolutions on a "Code of Ethics", (2) to address the standardization
of virus counting, (3) to further develop plans for virus prevalence
studies, and (4) to focus on the user's point of view.  The NCSA has
also started a program to certify virus scanners against the NCSA
collection (and quite a substantial collection it is).  All of these
things are designed to promote ethics within the industry and
provide some standards for outsiders to make quality purchasing
decisions.  Any
Comments, anyone?

We have two systems playing organ music and no monitor response.  Any

that it is a Halloween prank. But it still is debilitating two Macs.

You can do this, we have done it here in the student computer labs for
a while now.  The main problem seems to be that the users ignore the
message saying that the computer is infected.  We solved the problem
by having one of the consultants write a program that uses scan to
check for viruses, then sets off bells, sirens, and flashes a red
message if it finds an infection.  Now at least they pay attention to
the message.

Scan will only find viruses that have been discovered.  That is why
you should make sure you use the latest version.  I think that
McAfee's vshild will give you some protection against new viruses if
you set it up right.  Read the documentation.

Biological viruses do not need a living host to survive either. The
living host is required for propagation. This is very much similar to
how computer viri "reproduce".

Sorry about splitting hairs, but the name is more appropriate than

The reason for the problem with Desqview is that it takes over the
"Load-and-Execute" function and does not pass control to the previous
handler - including any antivirus programs that only check programs
when they are executed.

I am aware of the problem - it is documented in version 2.01, but I do
not yet have a solution for F-PROT - hopefully in 2.02.  As for the
other programs I have no information.
