VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

You won't find it...at least not under the old name.  Look for VSUMX9107.ZIP
on risc.ua.edu in the pub/ibm-antivirus directory.  Included below is some
information from one of the read-me files in the new package.
============================================================================
                      HyperText VSUM X9107 READ_ME.1ST

     With the June, 1991 release, the Virus Information Summary List
has been converted from its original ASCII list format into a custom,
hypertext database format.  With the new format, the product name has
been changed to HyperText VSUM.  The previous ASCII list product has
been discontinued, and will no longer be updated.

     Why the change to a hypertext database?  The original ASCII format
had become extremely large and unwieldy, it was difficult for most
people to effectively use.  Printing also had become a problem unless one
had a very high speed laser printer.  More importantly, the information
presented in the ASCII version was never really intended to be read
sequentially as a book, but instead to be a reference book or
encyclopedia.

You can't have a 100% secure system, it is always a trade-off between
security and what you can afford - in time/inconvenience/money/spare
slots/RAM/etc. Just like fire-walls for protection, you assume that
after some time they will give up or you will return and see them.
Think of hardware protection systems in a computer - you could lift
the lid and unplug the card, or whatever. If you put a padlock on it,
a determined hacker will bring cutters! if you encrypt the data, it is
a matter of time before any code can be broken. But, of course, you
can feel happy if it takes, on average, over 20 years on the fastest
computer to crack the code, or to cut the padlock the person has to
think of bringing bolt cutters in advance, and must sneak them past
everyone in the office, etc.

To stop careless use of a computer, software is often enough. To stop
a virus from infecting a hard disk, a simple switch in the disk cable,
accessible by anyone, isn't a security risk, it is perfectly good for
the job. Not that either method is totally safe against every
eventuality, but good enough under the circumstances.

By the way, a copy of a lock program (not the PC-Lock others have
mentioned) is available via anonymous ftp from newton.canterbury.ac.nz
[132.181.40.1] in the directory: /pub/antivirus.  It is a FREEWARE
demo: you may use it for free, but not sell it, and should use it with
care (caveat emptor and all that). To use the program type in LOCK/?
and it will explain the rest. Please send comments back to me, and
I'll pass them onto the author. NOTE that the newton computer is small
and slow; it would be nice if some other ftp site made the program
available.

Subject: Can virus infect PC data diskettes? (PC)

A friend (who works on a network which was hit recently by the STONED
virus) asked me to post the following questions.

1. Can a virus infect data diskettes and propagate from them (possibly
by rewriting the boot track)?

2. Can viruses infect data files (not executables) downloaded from
BBSes?

Also, if someone has a pointer to an archive with info about PC
viruses (in plain text), or good magazine articles, I'd appreciate
knowing that, too.

Thanks,

If CLEAN-UP comes across a virus that it can not successfully remove,

Given the nature of the problem with the virus, I am more inclined to
believe that the problem is a result of a variant of the virus.
However, given the fact that no infected executables are available, we
(McAfee Associates) will have to wait until another infection of a
similar nature is reported.

The virus is Tequila virus. It is originated in Swizerland and its
authors are known (brothers, aged 18 and 21).
When infected file is executed for the first time, it'll check if hard
disk's partition table is already infected. If the virus notices that
there's no copy of it in partition table, it will infect it. Next time
when you boot your computer from the infected hard disk, the virus
will begin to infect files. It uses variable encryption on files, but
on partition table it is in decrypted form. Virus infects only .EXE
files and they grow by 2468 bytes. Depending on date and how many
times infected files have been executed, the virus will display that
mandelbrot picture. If one executes that program virus suggest to
execute, a text about L.I.N.D.A. and beer will be displayed.

How about a Bernoulli Box, or some other form of removable hard disk?
I know it's an expensive (and drastic?) solution, but if the data is

Subject: Questions regarding Novell, Virus..

We have found that the best way of dealing with Macintosh viruses on a
Novell network is to limit the write privileges of lab users on the
server, and to use the Disinfectant Init along with periodic
Disinfectant scans.  Giving the user minimal write privileges will
help restrict where a virus might take hold on the Server.  This also
prevents users from changing the server configuration.  I also
recommend revoking write privileges to the Desktop file as well.

I have not found Mac viruses that infect DOS or Netware files, so the
worst case scenario is substantially reduced.  And while Mac viruses
seem to be more common they are usually less virulent than DOS
viruses.

Disinfectant from Northwestern U. has proven to be by far the most
effective virus eradication program.

In summary, rather that trying to erect huge anti-virus barriers which
are generally less than completely effective and tend to give a false
sense of security we remove the virus if and when they appear.

In nine months of supervising public Netware Macintosh Labs I have
often removed a virus from a user's disk, but never found one on a
server.

I hope this helps.

Subject: Bad hit on KENNEDY/12 Tricks Trojan?? (PC)

OK.  Here's a good one. . .

For whatever reason, one of our Business Profs decided to scan the
copy of VIRUCIDE on his hard disk, and lo and behold, SCAN 5.3C67
finds Kennedy and 12 Tricks Trojan in VIRUCIDE.EXE.  VIRUCIDE,
scanning itself, finds nothing.  SCAN also tells us that the file is
compressed with LZEXE and is infected internally.  Hmmmm.

Next step, we run SCAN 6.3V72 on VIRUCIDE.EXE, and the Kennedy virus
reveals itself again, but not the 12 Tricks Trojan.  Hmmm.  Next step,
run the latest release of SCAN.  Bingo, it finds Kennedy.  All
versions of SCAN that we throw at it find Kennedy and tell us that the
file is LZEXE compressed.

Now, a bit of info about VIRUCIDE: the file is 40209 bytes long, dated
5-8-90.  It appears to the user to be functioning properly, and even
though SCAN says it's infected, nothing *apparently* happens to the
system as a result.  However, one of our techies is looking at the
execution of the program, and has found that as VIRUCIDE scans a file,
it also attempts to perform a write to side 0 track 0 sector 6, thus
far unsuccessfully.  One of the strings it attempted to write was
"Disk Killer".  Hmmmmm.

F-PROT being my anti-virus package of choice, I threw VIRUCIDE at the
mercy of that.  F-FCHK didn't find anything in VIRUCIDE.EXE, nor did
it give any indication that the file was compressed in any way.  Next,
I installed F-DRIVER.SYS (with all necessary files, etc.) and *ran*
VIRUCIDE.EXE, and F-DRIVER let it through.  Hmmmm.

Now, except for the suspicious attempts to write to the boot sector,
it seems to me that McAfee SCAN is giving a false positive on the
Kennedy virus in VIRUCIDE.  VIRUCIDE (another, later version that
scanned clean by everything we threw at it) and F-PROT don't identify
anything.  And an old version of SCAN identified the 12 Tricks Trojan.
Unfortunately, I don't have any other disk scanners laying around that
I can check it against.  But our techies are looking a little more
closely into this suspicious disk write behaviour exhibited by the
suspect VIRUCIDE.

Any thoughts/ideas from the list at lagre, specifically the McAfee
crew (since both SCAN and VIRUCIDE came from McAfee)?  This is
certainly something that our University will take into serious
consideration as talks finalize on which product to go with as a
campus standard.

Thanks for your time!

Yeah, that's a problem we found out about immediately after the last
release.  It'll be fixed up in the next release of the code (actually,
the release *after* the next release).

It stems from some weird interactions we noted on Novell networks,
doing a workaround to solve that problem and then discovering that
3COM does stuff just differently enough to cause the high order
garbage you found.  Mea culpa: I only have a small Novell network
here, and should have checked with a 3COM dude.

Please give a call to Microcom at 919-490-1277 and report this bug?
See, then collect the bugs, stick it on a sheet of paper, and then
badger me mercilessly until that sheet of paper is nothing but cross

Subject: re: Partition Table Virus (PC)

Ms. (safe) Burke-Davis:

     I have never found it necessary to do a low level format of a drive
(including IDE) however have done it occasionally when there has not been any
information on the disk needing saving (all data is lost after a LLF). However
there is another method that a skilled technician can use.

	First, cold boot from a write-protected floppy disk containing DEBUG
and CHKDSK. Run CHKDSK (or SCAN /M) to determine if the virus is in memory -
if so the memory will show a loss of 1k from the TOM (640k machines normally
return 655360 bytes. 654336 or less is a danger sign unless something else is
going on (I do not know how your PC is configured so must be vague).

       If clean, my notes show that the virus moves the real Master Boot
Record (partition table) to track 0 head 0 sector 7. To disinfect, just
verify that track 0 head 0 sector 7 contains the MBR (look for the ASCII
warning messages near the end) and copy it to track 0 head 0 sector 1. This
will disconnect the virus code in sector 6 from the initialization sequence.
(to be really safe, zero out sector six).

	The PC should now be safe to use.

	This is a "stealth" virus so before disinfecting, you must make sure
that the virus is not resident in memory. Also, the TELEPHONICA infects
executable files so you must make sure that they are all cleaned before
execution or it will re-infect the PC. Just be careful but a low-level format
is unnecessary for a professional.

					Hope this helps,

General Description:

DISKSEC.EXE replaces the partition table of the hard disk with
code which performs load time checking and prevents access to the
hard disk if booted from floppy, and offers software write
protection to the system areas of the disk.  CHKSEC.EXE verifies
DISKSEC operation, and FLOPSEC.EXE creates a bootable floppy for
maintenance purposes.

            Comparison of features and specifications



User Friendliness

Installation

Default installation is simple and can be accomplished through a
supplied batch file (DSINSTAL.BAT).  A "quick start" reference is
provided along with the regular documentation.  For protection of
the hard disk only DISKSEC is required to be run, although this
limits the possibilities for recovery.

Novice users may not be sufficiently aware of the dangers
inherent in this process.  The program is replacing the partition
table of the hard disk, and, if it fails, all information which
the computer requires to access the disk and information will be
lost, even if the information is not, physically, erased.
Although the possibility of this is very small, a backup of the
partition boot record prior to installation would be a good idea.

Ease of use

Operation of the programs is simpe.  DISKSEC provides ample
prompting and opportunity for the user to stop at any point.
CHKSEC and DSRPART are quite terse in the feedback that they
provide to the user, but operate easily and well.

Help systems

None provided.  DISKSEC is well prompted and the other programs
have no options.

Compatibility


Company Stability

Padgett is an unstable personality, and should be avoided when
driving "The Judge."

Company Support

Padgett is well known as a contributor to VIRUS-L/comp.virus.

Documentation

The documentation is quite clear to anyone familiar with MS-DOS
operations.  Occasionally certain points may not be clear to
novice users (for example, the fact that "removal" of DISKSECURE
is done via the DSRPART program.)  The spelling could use some
work.

Hardware Requirements

None specified, but a hard disk and at least one floppy disk
(which can be used to boot from) would appear to be minimum
requirements.

Performance

In testing, DISKSECURE detected the presence of the BRAIN virus
and prevented infection.  DISKSECURE detected the presence of the
Stoned virus.  Infection of the hard disk occurred and the disk
was not accessible thereafter, even after booting from a clean
floppy.  Running DSRPART.COM removed the infection.  (NB - access
to the hard disk is restored only after rebooting once
DSRPART.COM has been run.)

Creation of a "maintenance" diskette with FLOPSEC appears to
render the diskette unusable for other purposes.  Diskettes with
important files on them should not be used, and nothing should be
written to them thereafter.

It appears that the program indulges in some "stealth" technology
of its own: the partition boot record appears unchanged after
installation.

Local Support

None provided.

Support Requirements

DISKSECURE is simple enough for a novice user to run, and should
provide significant protection with minimal risk.  Recovery is
quick and easy, as long as the user remembers the importance of
DSRPART.COM.  Intermediate users should note the difficulties in
running system optimizing software.
