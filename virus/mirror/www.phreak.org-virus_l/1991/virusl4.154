Did it tell some name? Or was it a completely unknown strain? I
suspect the latter, so I see two possible solutions:

1) You ran SCAN with the option which appends checksum signatures to
each file scanned. Therefore, you modivied NAV. Since it checks itself
on startup, it detects that something has gone wrong. If this is the
case, then the solution is to run SCAN again, this time with the
option that makes it remove the checksums from the files. Hint to
McAfee's group: don't modify other people's files; use a database for
the checksums instead.

2) You deleted or damaged (don't know exactly how) the NAV._XE (or was
it NAV._YS?) file on NAV's disk. This is a 77-byte hidden file, which
contains the checksum information. If this is the case, you have to
recreate the file (NAV has the possibility to create such files for
every COM and EXE file scanned). Hint to Symantec: don't use huge
number of small hidden files for each checksummed file, since this
confuses the users; use a database to put the checksums in instead.

What he has described was almost exactly how the 4096 (Frodo) virus
works. Such viruses exist since quite a while and we call them
"stealth", because they are "invisible" when active in memory.

But wasn't the original posting about Unix? An interesting question -
are stealth viruses possible under Unix?

This is the most secure measure. It should be sufficient. No need to
unplug the controller.

>2 ) Set the CMos data to no Hard Disk

This usually works, but you have to verify it yourself. Tell the CMOS
that there is no hard disk, then boot from a floppy and try to read
head 0, cylinder 0, sector 1 of the first hard disk (80h), using DEBUG
or Norton Utilities in /maintnance mode. If you don't know how to do
this, better stop here. If you don't succed to read a sector from your
hard disk, probably no virus will succeed too (at least none of the
known ones). Nevertheless, disconnecting the hard disk physically is a
better idea.

>3 ) Write in the partion table that every partition is write protected.

You cannot do this; there is no such field (about the write protection
of the partitions). The program Disk Manager uses write protection on
the virtual partitions that it creates, but it cannot stop direct disk
write (using BIOS), so it is VERY unsecure. My advice: don't mess with
the partition table at all; better disconnect your hard disk.

Hope the above helps.

P.S. One more thing. Buy several colored diskettes (preferably red).
Copy all viruses and test programs that you intend to infect, as well
as all tools that you'll need during the tests on these diskettes. Use
them and ONLY them during your tests. After you finish the tests, boot
from your hard disks and format all the red disks, WITHOUT EXECUTING
ANYTHING FROM THEM - regardless whether is is infected or not. Thanks
to Ross Greenberg for the suggestion.

Kamikaze is a HLL (High Level Language, in this case - Pascal) virus,
so it is difficult to extract a good scan string. F-Prot 1.15 indeed
cause false positives, but Frisk corrected the problem since 1.15a.
Also, if the number of files, where you detect the virus does not
increase, this means that you don't have this virus. :-)

I just ran tbscan with the 7-31-91 copy of virscan.dat.  It flagged
alot of files saying "infected by [compressed with EXEPACK]" I was
wondering if this is a virus or just a warning about a possible
infection.

Most of the files are part of MASM 5.0 (Microsoft Assembler).  Some
files also had flags saying compressed with EXEPACK.2 and LZH (or
something like that)

I just wanted to know if these files were ok.

Hi:

Saw a few comments on the 'VIRSIM Virus Simulator' that is floating
about..

It does have one possible use that its detractors have ignored that
I believe should be addressed..

It is great for upsetting network administrators etc when those
silly bogus virii start popping up at the hands of those who are
jerks.. I spent a lot of time verifying that there were no REAL ones
under just such circumstances recently.

I am also not very happy to see that rediculous thing on BBS systems
all over the country either..

Subject: Virus Simulators

Recently, a message was posted here regarding the so-called "Virus
 Simulator. This is *not* the VIRSIM suite of fake viruses written
 by Joe Hirst, but rather Virus Simulator v2.0, by Rosenthal
 Engineering, 3737 Sequoia, San Luis Obispo, California 93401.
 In reference to the announcement, Fridirik Skulason writes:

 > I fail to understand why the author of this program believes that
 > anyone might find it of any use whatsoever.

 Currently, there is no independent means of testing and verifying
 virus software. Simply having the word of a seller/producer has, of
 course, never been enough, and is not likely to ever be; the danger
 of collusion is simply too great for any reasonably-cautious
 consumer to accept it blindly.

 Since the virus-software publishers have not, on their own, instituted
 any kind of impartial test or verification that could satisfy a
 critical prospective buyer, and since they have also decreed highly
 restrictive sample distribution policies (which, predictably, do not
 apply to themselves), outfits such as Rosenthal Engineering perceive
 the obvious need for some sort of "test method" without using hard-to-
 get actual virus samples.  Of course, it is not enough.  However,
 instead of complaining about its inadequacy, we might have addressed
 the reason for the appearance of such software.  I fear we are not
 doing that at all, but should.

 Quite a few people would like to test virus scanners but are unable
 to do so because they do not have access to the large collection of
 viruses that is necessary to perform such tests. Virus Simulator
 doesn't test accuracy, but it does something else that's very
 interesting.

 But they do. Every one of the hundreds of "fake virus" files produced
 by the Virus Simulator succeed in triggering every virus scanner
 commonly used: SCANV, F-PROT, VIRX, IBM VIRASCAN, TBSCAN, etc. etc.
 They all denounce its "fake virus" files as if they indeed contained
 true viruses, though not all scanners report the same virus in the
 same file <g>. If nothing else, Rosenthal's Virus Simulator is a
 sobering educational tool which demonstrates how easy it is to fool
 all of the current scanners into producing false alarms, and how
 little uniformity there exists in virus nomenclature!

 Precisely. In reality, the files are not infected at all, but as far
 as the scanners are concerned, those files *appear* infected and are
 reported as such. And that points out a weakness of the scanning
 method better than any theoretical consideration I've seen.

 > Even if a virus scanner happens by chance to use a signature

 Probably not by chance. The code used in Rosenthal's fake viruses
 seems to trigger the scanners reliably every time... as intended.

 > ...and might therefore report the file as infected, this is of no
 > interest at all.

 It is of great interest. It demonstrates to prospective users how easy
 it is to produce false alarms using virus scanners and how deeply
 unspecific and unreliable string scanning is as a general method for
 detecting viruses.  In fact, I'm surprised that a program similar to
 Rosenthal's Virus Simulator has not emerged before.

 > The files created by the Virus Simulator may cause some virus
 > scanners to trigger in some cases,...

 Not `some scanners', and not `in some cases'. They cause all scanners
 (which I tried) to trigger in all cases, every time. It's remarkable.

 > ...but a perfect virus detector should be able to determine that the
 > files are not viruses, and should not trigger at all.

 Of course. And as soon as somebody invents this "perfect virus
 detector", Rosenthal's Virus Simulator will cease to be of interest.
 Until then, it remains a remarkable and interesting program which
 demonstrates how imperfect the virus scanners really are.

 Not misleading. The signatures don't need to be specially "provided
 by the author of the anti-virus program"?.  The signatures are
 contained in each issue of each scanner. Sometimes, they are modestly
 encrypted for reasons that were never satisfactory to me but, in any
 case, it's child's play to decrypt them. If not decrypted, they may
 be otherwise simply derived. I do not think that Rosenthal's
 statement was misleading at all. In my experience, his program does
 what he announced, and does it very competently, although some of the
 expressions and descriptions in his message here were rather less
 strict than what might have been desirable.

     To : all
Subject : new virus: Europe 92

Hello all: I've recently been infected with a virus that will
hang the system when the date is january 1st (or later).
Fortunately, this virus could be traced and destroyed fairly
quickly, but I was wondering whether I've been the only one to
have suffered from this virus.  It mainifested itself by
programming-errors: being a COM-virus, it was not able to infect
EXE files. When the virus attempted to infect bu couldn't
succeed, it left some files open. At a certain time, too many
files were opened for programs to work normally. These programs
therefore returned an error-code by which the virus could be
detected.

Although I'm not an expert on virusses and therefore haven't been
on this area very long, I did seem to understand that virus-codes
may not be echoed in this area. Therefore I won't do this, but if
anyone is interested (strictly for research of course), he or she
could sent me a netmail..

Please respond when you are experiencing symptoms as I mentioned
above or have any experience with the Europe 92 4Ever Virus.....

Sure will, just like cycling the power or pressing the reset button or
jumping directly to the BIOS boot routine will do the same thing. - As
we have said many times, only HARDWARE can avoid this. The purpose  of
NoFBoot is just to prevent INADVERTANT infection  of a  system  via  a
warm boot form an infected floppy (In my estimate, the cause of 40-50%
of all accidental - aren't most ? - infections.)

BTW - in ALPHA test for almost four days now with no reported problems.

I use two: Sourcer by Vi Communications (but it usually takes 3-5 passes to
get the output I want) and Microsoft's DEBUG (boo, hiss). The nice thing
about DEBUG is that it has no intelligence whatsoever so it does not try
to interpret anything (unlike Sourcer). WYSIWYG. Often an intelligent
disassembler will make assumptions that virus writers want you to make so
that their "cute" may go unnoticed. With DEBUG, if you tell it to
disassembe the interrupt table, it will.

Often when I get something strange in, both are used to generate outputs
which are then laid side by side and a quick run-through of the code is
made. Like other anti-virus tools, once is not enough.

The discussion so far seems to consist of a lot of flames however I can
see quite a bit of use for a "virus simulator" though not one that just
contains numerous search strings.

To explain this contradictory attitude, first consider the domain of
viral code. This contains all code that viruses use. Next consider the
subset of code that ONLY viruses use. Programs who venture out of this
smaller domain will trigger "false positives" (code found in viruses that
is also found in legitemate code).

Now, within the domain of "virus only" code (Fred C. considers this domain
to be closing on zero, I tend to disagree) there can exist a number of
variants of valid signature strings. Unless the "simulation" program
contains this domain in its entirety, it cannot be expected to be a
valid test of a scanner since the strings used may lie within the "virus"
domain but not within the domain of the scanner.

Should the scanner also use position dependanies, even if the same
string is used, if not in the same position within the simulator, a
valid scanner may fail.

Consequently, I consider a sigmature simulator to be of limited value
as a scanner validator.

However, it would still make an excellent training tool for teaching
technicians how to recognize virual activity. For example if a scanner
detects the STONED virus in memory yet "655360 total bytes memory" is
reported, one might logically expect that there has been a false negative.

Thus a STONED simulation should contain code to go resident at the
proper place in memory with the code used by the STONED (just disconnected)
to insure a valid test.

To me, this would be the real value of a simulator. Trying to extend its
function to validation as well would seem unviable.
