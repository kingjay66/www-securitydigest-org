You are correct in stating that you can "vaccinate" against the nVir
by creating dummy resources and pasting them into each application.
However, this will not be met with a favorable response from your
favorite anti-viral program.  I'd recommend not creating these dummy
resources, unless for whatever reason, you are not allowed to use a
program like Disinfectant or SAM.

Is there a system manager geographically near them who reads this and
could invite them over to get acquainted?  Show them some of the
existing cooperative anti-vandal effort?  Give both you and them new
resources?  Offer them access to the net through your system, either
by phone or by coming to your facility to use a local terminal?

Not without additional hardware I'm afraid.  Any program run from
AUTOEXEC.BAT or CONFIG.SYS is run after the disk has booted, and
(possibly) infected the hard disk.
     
You can get software which will detect the infection as soon as it
happens, but to prevent it, you need additional hardware, which will
prevent writes to the hard disk, unless some conditions are met.

I have checked my QEMM v5.0 master disks and find this signature also
occurs in the same named files, but which are obviously much older.
They are dated 9 March 90 on my disk. I have been using QEMM v5.0 for
a good few months (can't remember exactly when I bought it) and have
had no reason to suspect virus infection of my system. The age of QEMM
v5.0 without apparent virus report is interesting.
     
In addition, McAfee's scan program 5.1v67 fails to complain about QEMM
v5.0 or v5.1 despite manual inspection showing that the signature does
appear as reported above. A "Vienna/648" virus is described in the
McAfee documentation.
     
This is all fairly re-assuring to me, but it is possible that this
is a dormant virus just waking up. It needs further investigate (by
Quarterdeck I guess), but caution rather than panic seems appropriate.
     
Hope this adds to the investigation.

	There are many types of 3 1/2 PC disk drives. Some drives
actually detect a disk as soon as it is inserted. This type is
recognizable when the shutter door of the disk is heard to slide as
soon as the disk is inserted. However, I think that the sensor is a
purely mechanical sensor (switch) which is connected to a solenoid of
some sort, which makes a small lever slide the shutter.  The second
type of 3 1/2 disk drive slides the shutter open only when the disk is
accessed for the first time after being inserted in the drive.
	What one would need, is some guidelines on the features a PC
disk drive should have. Because of the number of cheap clones around,
there is still a long way to go.

When you light the computer the ROM BIOS checks the machine and then
searchs for someone disquette in drive A:. If it can read a boot
sector, read it in 0000:7C00 and run it.
     
(There is someones BIOS for AT's,'386 & '486 that permits configure
which is the drive for start and stores this information in CMOS
memory. I don't know if this is your case).
     
When a boot sector virus infects a disquette (with or without operating system)
it can make a boot sector that can infect any hard disk using
 - direct access to hard disk port
    (I don't know any virus that use this method actually),
 - BIOS Int 13h Function 03 (Write sector)
    (like Stoned)
 - DOS Int 26h (Write absolute sector).
    (like Bouncing Ball,
     
I don't know any solution throw software for the two first method of
infection but I can suggest that you change the ROM or add some EPROM
that prevents boot from A:.
     
The third method of infection has a solution using software. If you
clear the partition table of your hard disk, the DOS can't recognize
the hard disk (like it hasn't low level format), and Int 26h calls
will fail.  For a sucessfull boot from hard disk you must change the
original bootstart routine by another, that writes the original
partition table and then reads the boot sector of the active partition
and execute it. You must include a program that clears again the
partition table (I have a driver in CONFIG.SYS)
WARNING: - This method forces two writes in the partition sector (for create
           and erase the partition table) in each warm or cold boot. It can
           reduce MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures) of this sector, and a write
           error can to be dangereus.
         - If you don't have the DOS in the active partition, the problem is
           more complicated. (I can send you some ideas).

Subject: Re: QEMM Virus? Followup from Quarterdeck (PC)
     
Dear Virus-L moderator,
     
With reference to the report of a possible virus in QEMM-386 v5.1, this
is not a virus.  I have already passed the enclosed information through
to the comp.sys.ibm.pc.digest moderator where this report first surfaced
on the Internet/Usenet.
     
I have been in touch with Quarterdeck Office Systems because we make
extensive use of QEMM-386 in our development environment, and received
the following FAX from them.
     
======================= Start of FAX =============================
Dear Mr. Stanley,
     
Thanks for forwarding the FidoNet message.  We will see if we can
crawl on FidoNet and set the record strait (sic).
     
For the record, the byte string "EA F0 FF 00 F0" can indeed be
found in the OPTIMIZE.EXE and INSTALL.EXE as well as QEMM386.SYS.
     
That code is JMP F000:FFF0.  It is the way that we reboot the
system.  It is an intentional part of our code, not the result of
a virus.  While rebooting the system is something a virus might
do, having this code in your program certainly does not make you
a virus.  If this is the signature some virus scan program is
using to detect the 648 virus, it would seem they need to devise
a more discriminating test.
     
Please be assured that our programs are produced under highly
controlled circumstances and that great care is taken throughout
our organization with respect to virus infection.  We are
confident that none of the products we have ever shipped have
contained viruses.  Of course, our disk, like any unprotected
diskette is subject to infection by a virus when it is installed
on a machine which already carries a virus.  If you are concerned
about this, you should obtain and run one of the many good virus
detection programs, but again, the report you forwarded does not
indicate a virus.
     
Hopefully, all of this helps you breath easier.
     
Stan Young
Technical Support
======================== End of FAX ==============================
     
We had no evidence of a virus on any of our systems, but I thought
I ought to inform them of this report.  I have informed Quarterdeck
that I am forwarding their reply to you.  I believe that you should
publish this information as soon as possible, to allay fears that
may have been started by the wide dissemination of the original
report.  If you wish to cross-check my information before publishing
it (I, too, could be a malicious prankster), Quarterdeck's standard
phone line is (213) 392-9851, and their technical support line is
(213) 392-9701.
     
I have no connection with Quarterdeck other than as an extremely
satisfied user of QEMM-386.

Subject: Various thoughts
     
	Being a new year and having some time over the holidays to
collect a few thoughts on PC (IBM-type) viral protection.
     
	First off, the only effective solution to unknown boot sector
viruses (as well as known ones) would have to be in the form of an Int
13 intercept, and the only time that the system is both stable and
known that software can affect is on the partition table read
following POST since neither DOS nor anything else has revectored the
interrupts yet. Since there is no way short of hardware to prevent
floppy booting, protection must take place here. This way, even if an
infection takes place, it can be detected immediately, something I do
not believe can be guarenteed at any later time (e.g. in CONFIG.SYS or
AUTOEXEC.BAT).
     
	A second layer is some form of system protection that monitors
the operating system and prevents subversion. The easiest method would
be to incorporate this into the "special" partition table but must be
recognized as a separate task.
     
	The next layer of protection would be authentication of files
presented to the operating system for execution such as any number of
systems do (Enigma-Logic's VIRUS-SAFE, McAffee's SCAN with the /AV, or
the Dr. Panda Utilities plus many others). Such authentication can
only be effective if the operating system can be trusted when it is
invoked.
     
	Finally, some form of authentication or denial of unknown
programs presented to the system (floppies) must be provided, such as
with McAfee's VSHIELD, Fridrik's F-PROT, or CERTUS. The trouble is
that such scanning is only good on known infections and must be kept
up to date. For many the thought of updating 5000 machines with no
budget is horrifying.
     
	Intelligent application of these four elements should reduce
risk of infection to near zero and detect the remainder as soon as
they happen.
     
	Lately, I have been playing with some "smart" partition table
programs and other than the difficulty of debugging (when you make a
mistake, on boot the PC just sits there smiling at you) and proper
handling of registers in a 50h byte "nitch", it is proving very
interesting. For instance "fixing" a PC so that if it is booted fom a
floppy, the hard drive is just not there to DOS is trivial and
STONED/JOSHI/BRAIN attacks are immediately detected.
     
				Having fun in the Sun
     
						Padgett
     
ps some of the techniques found could correct viral mistakes so I cannot
   discuss these in an open forum or with unknown individuals however, the
   above should point to things to look for in a "good" anti-virus program
   or mix of programs.

Subject: Stoned in KC, Mo. (PC)
     
Just got off the phone with a friend of mine in Kansas City, MO.  He
has been infected with the Stoned virus (don't know which variant).
     
He apparently contracted the infection from a borrowed copy of
Ontrack's Disk Manager.  The diskette was obtained from the Computer
Resale Center in Kansas City.  He has not booted up with any other
diskettes in quite some time, so he strongly suspects the Disk Manager
diskette.  Fortunately for him, he had already cleaned off the drive
and was preparing to low-level format the hard drive anyway.  He will
start with a cold boot from a clean diskette before proceeding (don't
want to spread the beast any further).
     
He has contacted the vendor and alerted them to the problem.  As
always, there are no guarantees, but it would seem that the Ontrack

Lots of stuff deleted here:
     
What you needed to do was to a) Boot from a clean copy-protected disk
(which you did), then b) Fix your HD boot sector. Having done that,
Stoned is dead.  Finally, c) Go through your floppies with e.g. SCAN,
and treat them the same way... Stoned can only get off the floppy if
you boot off the floppy.

Hate to say this, but he's smarter than you are!!! LegaliSe is the
Queen's English as spoken here in NZ (where Stoned originated, and is
now at epidemic levels) -- your version is a mere vulgar Americanism.
:-)

Many software shops here open packages for demos, etc., then reseal
them. It is not uncommon to find a virus on a disk in a "sealed"
package.
