Call for Papers - Fifth Annual Computer Virus & Security Conference

VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

The usefulness of SECURE is subject to debate.  My opinion is however
that the simple fact that is written by Mark Washburn is a pretty good
reason to ignore the program - as well as all other programs written by
known virus authors.

Instead of just answeing by private mail, I decided to post the answers,
hoping they will be of general interest.

This problem is not solvable with the current version of VIRSTOP.  There are
some advantages to loading the program from CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT,
but if that is done the program will be disabled if certain network
products are run afterwards. (Or for that matter any program which takes
over INT 21H, 4BH and does not call the original handler).  DesqView,
PC-NFS and Novell-Netware are such programs.

This is not only a problem for VIRSTOP - all other anti-virus programs
that monitor this function and check programs on-the-fly face the same
problem.

In version 1.16 this was solved by running F-NET.EXE after the network
software was loaded.  There were som minor compatibility problems, but
I think I have them solved now, and a fix should appear in 2.02 - where
you can re-run VIRSTOP, and it will simply rehook INT 21.

It will be dropped in 2.02.  It is only identical to VIRSTOP.EXE in the
"English-only" version of F-PROT, but is used as a "skeleton file" in the
multi-lingual versions.

Use old F-TEST.COM from 1.16 - it will be stopped if the package is
installed correctly.  I am writing a replacement program, however - it
will (also) appear in 2.02.

There is no such switch.  If I had provided one, I would have opened a
"loophole" that a virus could exploit to throw remove or disable the
program.

Yes, but not all PC-viruses - only the "well behaved" ones.  In practice
this means the same viruses as those which work withour problems in the
oldest versions of the DOS-compatibility box under OS/2.

Viruses which use undocumented functions, jump directly into DOS or use
other nasty tricks will usually not work.

Let me guess... You turn on the Mac, here 3 tones, and nothing else
happens?

If so, it is the dead mac dirge that those 'organs' are playing.

Take the machine to service.

Read your manual, it talks about the startup diagnostic tones.

Well, the delay should barely be perceivable - I did a small test, and
a virus scan is possible in just below 1 second when a program is run from
a floppy and around 0.1 second when I run a program from the hard disk.  As
a 0.1 second increase in loading time is not noticable, I see no reason
why the programs should not always be checked when run - assuming
the scanner is fast enough..... :-)

Greetings all,

Could someone explain why SCAN goes over all .sys and all .prg files when
scanning a drive???  Also where can I find the latest VSUM?

Subject: DIR-2 found in USA (PC)

At Rutgers University in New Jersey, we have experienced an outbreak of
the DIR-2 virus, identified by Macafee Version 7.9V84 as D2. I have not
had the opportunity to try everything I could think of, so here's a
summary.

In a lab of 20 386SX running DOS 3.30, 4 machines were found to be
infected.  These machines showed more than 40 infected files, so I
elected to low level format and reload.  That worked fine.

Applying a small amount of finesse, I attempted to clean an infected
diskette, and found that if I executed scan from the same drive as the
infected diskette "clean a: [D2] /many", that clean reported that it was
unable to clean, that this virus might be a variant, and that I should
contact Macafee associates.

Having talked through the process with John Macafee, I find that if I copy
clean to an uninfected C: drive, and "clean A:", that clean successfully
removes the infection.

John pointed out that after I booted from a known clean diskette, there
was no reason not to copy clean to the hard disk and execute it from
there.  This works for floppy disks, I haven't tried it for a hard disk.

Subject: McAfee84 fails on Stone, Azusa and Joshi? (PC)

We are in the process of evaluating McAfee program, specifically the
VSHIELD84. We have vshield installed on all machines's autoexec.bat
with parameters '/m /chkhi /lock', however our computers are still
infected by those 3 viruses. The Clean program was able to remove
Stone and Azusa, but it failed to remove Joshi even though it reported
that it was successful in removing Joshi.

Isn't Vshield supposed to block those viruses from getting to our
computer in the first place?  Are we missing something? Or are we
doing something wrong?  I'd appreciate your comments and expertise.
Or should I use different program?

Thank you,

If you have a large enough contiguous block of upper memory, VSHIELD
will load itself high with both QEMM and the /LH parameter being used.
However, most people using QEMM don't.  This is something that our
programmers are looking into

416 bytes, actually :-)  This is a normal function of VSHIELD.

You could run it as the first command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT.

You can check VSHIELD by running it with the /CV option to check
validation codes and then modifying a validation coded file with a
sector editor and trying to run it.  If VSHIELD says that the file nas
been modified and an infection may have occurred, well, then, you know
that it's working.

Not unless there was some special operation between the host computer
and your terminal to automatically download and execute program code.

> How about when I download?

You could download a file infected with a virus, but you would still
have to execute it.  You could, of course, always run the VIRUSCAN
program against anything you download before executing it to confirm
that it is free of viruses (at least those that the SCAN program
recognizes, of course).

Most files that are transmitted these days are in comrpessed form
(e.g. ARC, ZIP, ZOO, LZH, etcetera).  A file would have to be
decompressed before it was scanned for a virus.  This would be more a
function of the VIRUSCAN program then VSHIELD.

Hello Cezar,

What exactly happened is unclear, but it sounds like you ran CLEAN-UP
on a PC with the virus in memory, and after CLEAN-UP removed the virus
from the disk it transfered back to the disk from memory..  The
VIRUSCAN and CLEAN-UP programs will not check memory for the Stoned
virus unless you tell them to with the /M option which tells them to
check memory for prank/non-dangerous viruses.

Oops!  You're right.  Apparently there is a file named HORSBOOT.COM in
the library.  A quick and dirty examination of it with Vern Berg's
LIST program reveals it to be boot code.  Apparently someone saved off
the sector or compiled it...
