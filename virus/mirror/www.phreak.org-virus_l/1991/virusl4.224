VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Hmm none of the mailer programs for BBSes that I have used was able to
interpret the keyboard redefinition codes in the ANSI bombs. This is
not a danger. <<
"
Indeed, this is the case, for me, as well. None of the mailers I know of for
FIDO, in particular, will allow high order chrs,  or any ANSI sequences. All 7
bit stuff. GT network allows ANSI, but only in specific echoes, and even there,
the GT TERMINAL has it's own ANSI driver, which is somewhat limited it what it
will allow. Leave the term, and that layer of ANSI redefs are gone. Same with
most of the readers around that work with GT.

>>The danger is if somebody puts an ANSI bomb in an
archive's comment or in a README file, so that if you view it later
(in DOS mode, not using your communication software)<<

In the case of the ZIP comment, this is no problem, for the most part, since
this ANSI inclusiuon, far as I know, only works with  REGISTERED versions of
PKZ, and therefore it's fairly easy to trace a 'bugged' file to it's source.

>>Anyway, I always
disable the keyboard reprogramming feature of my ANSI driver, there is
no real need for it - at least for me.<<

I went to a re-write of ANSI that doesn't allow redefs, and as such was a lot
smaller. Saved me a few K in space, and disabled any ANSI bombs in the process.
Good trade off, I think.

Looks rather nice!  Gratified to see NIST's incorporated our
suggestions on the earlier draft (and no doubt those of others).
Appendix B would be quite valuable; are you actively working on
preparing it?  (Appendix B is labelled "Sample names cross-indexed
against several common naming sets".)

The convention that we're currently working with at HICL is similar to
NIST's: ours is essentially just "family-strain", as in "Vienna-Ira".
The addition of ";number" seems like a reasonable idea off the top of
my head; avoids wasting a whole new name on the fifth tiny variant of
the Sunday, or whatever.  We currently do something like this with
multiple layers of hyphens (as in "Vienna-Viola-B4").  I know Alan
Solomon uses dots (as in Anticad.4B).  If we can get it to the point
where the major disagreement in the community, as far as naming, is
about what punctuation marks to use, we'll be in pretty good shape!

Does anyone know of, or use, a radically different naming convention
(other than the ones mentioned and decided against in the NIST
documents)?

Subject: Re: Taxonomy

I have received a number of questions by E-mail regarding virus
taxonomy, in response to my earlier posting.

May of the replies dealt with one and the same subject - how to
determine the relationship between two viruses.

In an attempt to clarify my opinions, I will therefore describe the
system I use.

Problem: Given an ever-growing set of viruses for the same hardware platform,
         how does one classify them into a hierarchy.

It is possible to design a function-based classification scheme, which
would take into account features such as what the virus infects,
stealth/non-stealth, resident/non-resident, how it allocates memory,
but personally I see too many problems with this approach.

I am in favour of system based on the relationship between viruses - a
system which gives three levels of classification, where I try to
classify viruses so that:

    ...non-related viruses belong to separate families

    ...related, but different viruses that can be disinfected in exactly
       the same way are sub-variants of the same variant.

So, given two viruses A and B, there are three possibilities:

    1) A and B belong to different families
    2) A and B are different variants of the same family.
    3) A and B are different sub-variants of the same variant.

Besides, this matches the NIST proposal quite nicely....

Rule #1  If A or B are encrypted, decrypt and only consider the decrypted
         viruses in the following steps.  If a virus uses self-modifying
         encryption, do not consider the variable part when comparing the
         viruses.

Rule #2  If there are fundamental structural differences in how A and B
         infect the same program, for example if one virus adds its code
         to the front of infected files, but the other virus appends the
         code to the file, the viruses belong to different families.
         Note that this rule for example permits a COM and a COM/EXE virus
         to belong to the same family.

Rule #3  If the following holds true

                Related(A,B)

         then A and B belong to the same family.
         The function Related(x,y) is defined below.

Rule #4  If there exists a virus X where the following holds true:

                Related(A, X) = TRUE
                Related(B, X) = TRUE

         then A and B belong to the same family as X.

Rule #5  If there exist viruses A' and B' where the following holds true:

                A' and B' are known to belong to the same family.
                Related(A, A') = TRUE
                Related(B, B') = TRUE

         then A and B belong to the same family (same as A' and B'), otherwise
	 they belong to different families.

Rule #6  If A and B belong to the same family, but have different lengths, or
         if they cannot be disinfected in exactly the same way, then they are
         considered to be separate variants.

Rule #7  If A and B belong to the same variant, but if there is so much as a
         one-bit difference in the program code, or any static data, including
         non-referenced text strings within the virus, then A and B are
         considered to be separate sub-variants.

The function Related(X,Y) compares two blocks of code, and returns TRUE if
Virus X has significant amount of code in common with virus Y.

This function can be implemented in several ways - for example by comparing
the histograms of the various bytes found within the code, but I currently
use the following:

     Compute the average of

        The number of all substrings of X of length N, found within Y
        -----------------------------------------------------------------
                     length(Y) - N + 1

      and

        The number of all substrings of Y of length N, found within X
        -----------------------------------------------------------------
                     length(X) - N + 1


The resulting number is between 0.0 and 1.0, and gives an indication of
the similarity of X and Y.

Return TRUE if the number is above a certain maximum, and FALSE if it is below
a certain minimum.  "Uncertain" cases will be settled by a committee.... :-)

So far the method works fine, and if a N of 12-16 is used it will usually
give a relationship index of 0.6 or higher for viruses known before to be
related, but non-related viruses usually get an index around 0.05.

                 ^^^^^
Disagree: DiskSecure can make part or all of a partition readonly (and
does) and it loads beneath DOS. With respect to compression, it can
only protect the entire area (and easily too since compressed
partitions are a fixed size just like real ones. Also, as we have
discussed (BYPASS), such a protection element can be controlled from
something above DOS.

You are correct from a single element concept, but a two part system,
with one at the BIOS level and the other at the DOS device driver
level (like most compression routines) that handshake with each other
would be very manageable. Though not as global as we are describing, I
know of at least one access control program (Enigma-Logic's PC-SAFE -
plug, one of the few I couldn't break quickly) that functions both
above and below DOS.

I take a more optomistic view: DOS is just a program and when properly
understood can be both controlled and trusted. The hard part is
designing a mechanism that is applicable to 60+ (or whatever) million
existing platforms, installs automatically & seamlessly, is compatable
with all known applications, and uses no memory.

Given a known system, BIOS, and O/S, the task is considerably easier
than finding something that is truely "generic".

Agree, however by definition a virus spreads to other files else it is
not a virus. Besides the actions described are harmless (well, for the
moment) malicious software must be *executed* to have effect and this
can be detected or blocked once you accept that certain functions
(copy, modify, delete) can be permitted in some directories or
partitions and not in others (why viruses do not spread well in
mainframes without help). The full philosophy would fill a book (maybe
someday) but just because DOS *doesn't* does not mean it *can't*.

(Wonder if a "Secure DOS" would sell...)

Again, this indicates single thread thinking. On my home PC, the 120
MB of (apparent) disk storage is separated into an 80 MB piece that
does not permit writing/deletion/modification without authorization &
anything that tries gets flagged. This is at the BIOS level and works
nicely with Windows & SuperStor (both have other problems not related
to this element) The other 40 MB chunk is used for text and
development and I can write etc freely as can any application.

When I boot the PC, it comes up in D: and I rarely have to directly
access C: at all, executables run via PATH & APPEND. My biggest gripe
is with the 128 byte PATH limit so am forced to resort to ASSIGN. (fix
is somewhere in the RSN queue but for the moment am swamped with VAXes
& Unix platforms).

The major difficulty is that it took me considerable manual tweaking
to create this system on my PC so is Not Ready for Prime Time but the
problem is one of development and not one of theory.

Subject: Virus Verification and Removal

The November 1991 issue of Virus Bulletin has a paper by me on the
above subject.  It talks in general about verifying the identity of a
virus (why and how), and attempting to remove viruses from infected
objects (why, why not, and how); and it talks about the prototype
program that we have to do these things.  The program is basically a
little interpreter for a high-level language that describes viruses
for verification and removal purposes.  I know various other folks
have done similar things, and we hope that this paper will stimulate
discussion (and/or bragging!) on the subject.

At the time the paper was originally written, we hadn't actually
implemented the removal part of the language yet.  We now have, and of
course the language underwent considerable changes during
implementation.  To keep things current, I've updated the paper, and
Ken has kindly agreed to make it available in the VIRUS-L archives.  A
flat text version of the paper is available for FTP on
cert.sei.cmu.edu, as "pub/virus-l/docs/verify.remove.chess.txt".
There's also a PostScript version, but it's not quite working yet (the
version I sent Ken seems to assume that your PostScript printer has an
EBCDIC character set, hehe!).

Feedback and discussion very welcome...

[Ed. Thanks for contributing the paper to our archives, Dave!  If
anyone wants a PostScript copy of this paper, please be patient; Dave
and I are working on the details...  The ASCII text file is now on
cert.sei.cmu.edu (192.88.209.5), however, as Dave points out.]

VSHIELD is designed to intercept "warm boots" (Ctrl Alt Del's) and
then check the boot drives (A: and C:) for a boot sector or partition
table virus before allowing the reboot to continue.  VSHIELD then does
a "cold boot" to clear anything out of memory.  If you want to disable
feathis then add "/NB" to the VSHIELD command line in your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

I agree with one exception, that I witnessed myself. There has been
indeed at least one attempt of a software professional writing a virus
program under "normal business" contract. (I'll give you the story few
lines later)

anything on either side?

Almost true, but, how could they? The IBM "cheap hardware" designers
and "open architecture marketers" did not leave them much of a
chance, did they?

> To this day, the antivirus publishers have been unable to take

Again, how could they? They are certainly unable to guarantee
detection of every virus possible, although there are good chances
to catch few, if not many *know* worms and virus, so you have to
know (analyze) them first, before you can protect against them,
leave alone getting rid of them, once you got them.

I do agree that relying entirely on so-called desinfection is not an
option alone, but you *sometimes* have to. Certainly always, one
or several of the following "sins" have been comitted before the
necessity arouse:
 - insufficient backup
 - careless behaviour (causing the virus infection)
 - obtaining program(s) from questionable source(s)
 - insufficient access control/restriction to computer/system
 - insufficient monitoring/administration
 - use of insufficient hardware / operatnig system software

The latter is most certainly a cause of all PC virus infections.
I remember quite well how shockesd I was when I got my first
original IBM pc (BIIIG thing with 128 Kb RAM!) back in '82 or '83
and looked for the diskette write protect switch and found none!

IBM being IBM, they learned nothing from my protest letter & forgot
to spend the pennies on a disk write enable switch for their PC/XT
to come later ... not to talk about MESS DOS.  I have never seen a
disk drive w/o write enable switch, before I got a PC.

Says Fred Waller:

> Software cannot ever provide a permanent defense against software.

True, but with little hardware assistance, imho, it can.

Ok, here comes the promised story:
There was a small starting enterprise, pretty low budget, and a big
well established company that offered to take it over. The funders
of the former declined, and got some rather threatening personal
words as a response from the manager of the multinational.

The three persons running that small enterprise had all their money
and plenty of time & much more invested in it, and were afraid to
see it go down the drain. In fact, one of them had already lost 10
years of his life worth of labor in such an incident.

There was a fair upcoming that should be some starting point for
getting really off the ground, and they had good reasons to fear,
that someone could come and steal their software from their stand
at the fair.  So they convinced their chief (and almost only)
software writer to implant "some sort of computer virus" in it, so
that nobody could make any use of a copy of it.  (Not exactly a good
protection, IMO)  Well, the software guy did try to convince them
that this was immoral & generally not helpful, and he was extremely
discouraging with that, to no avail, he was ordered based on his
work-contract, and had to.  (He consulted a lawyer, who, after
hours having the issue explained, gave advice to write the damn
code and said there was little hope that a court might have
accepted such immoral order as an acceptable reason to prematurely
quit the job, etc.

So this virus was written under the usual unhealthy circumstances
and economical and time deadlines. It was ready one or two days
before the fair began, but unfortunately could not be used there.
During the last test session the virus proved that it worked as
intended by formatting a hard disk, thus erasing both itself and all
of its sources.  8-()  No Backups.  Accidentally, the virus programmer
quit the job as soon as his contract permitted.  Yes, I know him
personally, he's a friend.

Subject: Hard disk problem (PC)

Greetings,

   I have a question, concerning my brother's PC. I installed a new
(40m) hard disk into his 286 PC UNLIMITED(?) after his original hard
disk got trashed. I have sinced moved out of state, (Mass).  He called
me a couple of months ago reporting that his hard disk wasn't working,
similar to the previous problems, (where the machine wouldn't
recognised the hard disk). I told him that since the disk was still
under warrenty, he need to call the numbers on the card to see if they
knew what was going on. (He has been scanning clean but the scan he
has is scanv72).
    He never followed up, but recently moved the PC into another room
and after plugging in and turning the machine on, the system install
disk for the hard drive was requested. He called the business I bought
the drive from, they walked him through the procedure and he was up
and away, except, the drive doesnt boot up, He needs to go through
these procedures every time he wants to use the PC. Is there anything
overlooked. I am pretty sure that his problem is hardware, but if
anyone has experienced this or knows what is wrong, I am all ears...

                                  Thanks in advance

Boffin "plotted Aids blackmail"

A scientist obsessed with Aids hatched a blackmail plot that

Dr Joseph Popp, aged 41, a health and computer consultant
with the World Health Organisation, send 20,000 disks containing
a computer virus to medical research institutes around the
world after being rejected for a new job and suffering a chronic
mental breakdown.  He then demanded 6 million pounds for a

Judge Geoffrey Rivlin stayed proceedings against Dr Popp after
hearing he was too ill to plead.  Dr Popp is expected to return
to America, having been extradited to Britain to face 10 charges

  this isnt quite true.  The Commie 128 often has it's rom-based OS
mapped into the C000 block of it's memory...when you stop using a
program that doesnt automatically force you to reboot, then this
ram-based system is used...allowing virusi to spread easily...not even
NEEDING the trojan horse.
 *shrug* I'm an IBM'er now, so....the point it moot.

OK, I agree with your proposition.

Sigh... They have been caught in the wild, nevertheless, so I guess
they do work in Bulgaria... Have you tried PC-DOS 3.30?

Oh, does it? Hmm, maybe just some of the scan string that you're using
for the Warrior family happen to be pressent? Did you examine the
structure of the virus?

At least two viruses do not change the file entry point. Leapfrog
(516) modifies the instruction the initial JMP points to (for COM
files) and Voronezh-1600 places a Far CALL to its body at the EXE
files entry point.

Check the doc on the program. I thought that you could not do a warm
boot w/VSHEILD.

Yep, it really flies... Damn, from what you describe, I'm convinced
now that this virus has really been introduced in the USA. (The three
other reports that I received turned out to be false alerts.) Since
you seem to have let "escape" the infection (in the initial report I
heard only about 40 infected files, which sirprized me a lot), it's
almost certain that it won't be possible to erradicate the epidemic
and the virus will spread widely in the States... :-((( It does not
work under MS-DOS 5.0, but just a few minutes ago I received a phone
call from the Lab of Computer Virology in Sofia and they told me that
an improved version of the virus, working perfectly under DOS 5.0 has
been reported... :-(

Also Dr. Solomon's Anti-virus Toolkit, version 5.13 and above, is able
to detect the virus. Not to eradicate it, however. The only three
methods for removing this virus which are currently availble, are
CLEAN 84, my program DIR2CLR, and using the REN method, described by
Andrzej Kadlof (similar to your backup method, but much easier and
faster).

You are right, but not for the reason you suggest. This virus does not
try to infect anything on volumes, which are accessed by loadable
device drivers. This includes any LANs (not only Novel), DiskManager,
Stacker, SuperStor, or DiskReet volumes.

:-). Yeah, MS-Windows is an excellent anti-virus tool... As soon as
you get infected, it crashes... sometimes even before... :-)

True, with one exception. If you have a file, which has used the last
cluster of the disk before the disk has become infected, the virus
will damage the file, by overwriting this cluster. It will also
"shorten" the disk, so that the cluster(s) with its body will be no
long reachable. If they happen to belong to a file and you run CHKDSK
even with a virus active in memory, CHKDSK will report that the
damaged file contains an "invalid cluster number".

You have to mention explicitely that the virus -MUST- be active while
you're performing the backup. Also, a much easier method, suing only
REName commands has been presented here by the Polish anti-virus
researcher Andrzej Kadlof.

In general, this virus is somewhat similar to the WDEF virus for the
Mac world - fast, stealth, and easy to erradicate. I'm afraid that it
will spread just as widely... :-(

Oh, to use these tools against this virus means "to use a microscope
for braking nuts", as we say in Bulgaria... :-) The REN method is much
easier and does not require any additional programs...
