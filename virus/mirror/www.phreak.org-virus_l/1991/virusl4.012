We have had the stone virus pop up here with one or two incidents but
was able to catch it with the McAfee software.  So the suggestion of
the stone virus not being in the states yet can be considered false.

Subject: Comments on GAME2 (IBM VM/CMS)

I have made a preliminary analysis on GAME2 MODULE and have stored my
comments on LISTSERV@PCCVM under the file GAME2 COMMENTS. Included in
this file are several notes from other contributors from other lists.
I will be adding to the COMMENTS file as more information is forwarded
and/or found. The copy of the virus that I was given is 'broken' and
my testing was therefore limited. A better (un-received) copy is
needed to continue. Please remember that I am not an 'expert',
'authority', or 'guru' in these matters, I am still learning.

All mailings to this list will automatically forwarded to VIRUS-L,
hopefully this will not cause too much duplication. Any assistance
and/or 'viral cracking' programs that you could give me would be
greatly appreciated.

Subject: Virus X?? (Mac)

In a recent issue of the Australian Macintosh magazine "MacNews", it
was announced that there was a new Mac virus called "Virus X".
Apparently, every time you restart your mac, it deletes a file, going
in backwards numerical order. Recommended procedure for finding out if
you have the virus is to create a file called, say, "z", then reboot
your mac. If the file's gone, you've got the virus.

I haven't seen any similar symptoms mentioned before, so could this be
a first for Australia?

Subject: STONED and NON-bootable floppies (PC)
I learned something new about the STONED virus today. One of our users' PCs
was infected by the STONED virus by attempting to boot from a  NON-bootable
diskette   that   was   infected!   All   MS/DOS  diskettes  (bootable  and
non-bootable) have a sector reserved for the boot code (the boot sector). I
was under the  impression  that  the  DOS  boot  code  had  to  be  present
(bootable)  in  order for the STONED virus to move itself to the hard disk.
This was an incorrect assumption."

I understand from several Virus-L recent messages  that  PC  'non-bootable'
floppies  are  actually  bootable,  and  their  boot sectors contain only a
little program that merely prints out "This disk  is  not  bootable".  Thus
Stoned etc can infect them same as any other PC floppy.

The original "Stoned" virus came in two variants. Both infect the
Partition Boot Record - the first physical sector on the hard disk.
The original PBR is stored on head 0, track 0 and either on sector 2
or sector 7.

Those sectors are normally unused, but not always.  In particular, if
the hard disk is small, and formatted under DOS 2.x (even though it
may now contain DOS 3.x), the first track will be in use.

In some cases the DOS boot sector is located in sector 2, and will be
overwritten, but the other variant of the virus may overwrite a part
of the FAT - located at sector 7, which could, indeed, be restored
from the other copy - provided you do the repair right after
infection.

On large hard disk, or disks formatted under DOS 3.x this is not a
problem.

Subject: Plans regarding F-PROT (PC)

I just wanted to inform readers of VIRUS-L/comp.virus of my plans for
F-PROT.

Version 1.14 will be distributed on Monday, Jan 21st.  It is able to
detect and remove over 70 new viruses (most of them recent viruses
from Eastern Europe), which 1.13 could not handle.

I will send out copies to the people on my mailing list, in the form
of an xxencoded .ZIP file as I usually do.  I will also send a copy to
the moderator of comp.binaries.ibm.pc - hoping the program will appear
there soon.

>From now on a new version of the program may be expected once per
month - I am leaving my job here at the University of Iceland and plan
to work full-time on the viruses.

At the same time I am cancelling some other plans, and announcing that
I will continue to support and update the program for the next 24
months - but continued support after that will depend on the success
of the product.

Version 2.0, with a totally rewritten user-interface will be ready for
beta-testing in the first week of February - are there any volunteers
who would like to assist in the testing ?

I have now decided to distribute it as previous versions, that is
"freeware" for individual use, but "shareware" for
companies/institutions, but I am not ruling out the possibility of an
expanded, commercial version, though.

Without specific comments about the cyberpunk musings of Iraqi
weapons, is anyone else concerned about the usage of these terms?
Specifically the tendancy of mostly non technical people to classify
any intentional or unintentional bug and computer "nasty" as a virus?

I see the terms defined more or less thus:

Virus - A self replicating piece of code that is atached to another
  program or OS and that depends on that program running in order for it
  to be executed.  This is what most of us reading here are familiar with.

Worm - A self replicating program that is complete in itself.  Usually
  replicating over a network.  Morris's creation was the "Internet
  Worm".

Trojan (Horse) - Code that included in a program that is intended to
  do something other than what the original program is supposed to do.
  Usually something bad.

Magic Cookie - Code or feature put into a program intentionally by the
  programmer that is not part of the design.  It is usually
  something harmless. Many instances of this in commercial software
  and the kind of thing that is alluded to in the post about military
  weapons.  Another example is the 'xyzzy' command in DG's AOS
  operating system.

Subject: Need help w/ CMOS problem in PS/2 Model 70 (PC)

My apologies if this group is not appropriate, but I would like to
solicit advice on a problem that may be a malicious attack:

I am looking at a friend's PS/2 Model 70 that he reports has had
problems including problems reading diskettes that appear to be fine
in another machine (a laptop that I am keeping carefully isolated).
Since the PS/2 has been exposed to physical, unmonitored access by
outsiders, I suspect that the machine may have been tampered with.
The SCAN program reports no viruses in the system, but the INFOPLUS
program (on the CMOS page) reports that the CMOS checksum is
incorrect; other anomalies on this page include a ridiculous system
date and no hard disk reported.  However, the system does boot off of
the hard disk, and the DOS date command reports the correct date.  My
friend reports some unusual behavior reading and writing the hard
disk, but I have been reluctant to test the system further.

I seem to remember hearing of the possibility of altering the CMOS
as a form of computer attack.  Could someone enlighten me on this subject
briefly, or alternately, point me to a reference?  I have general
technical background in PCs, but will need specific info on how to
approach this problem.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: Query - Disinfectant vs. Virex (Mac)

There is some discussion here about the relative merits of
Disinfectant 2.4 versus Virex 1.3 . Apart from issues of personal
taste which supplies a greater range of protection?  For example, is
Virex effective against WDEF? Are there viri (a/k/a viruses) which are
detected by one but not the other?  (For the record D 2.4 is circa
Fall 1990, V 1.3 is circa 1989).

Any information would be most helpful!

   Ooops.  Yes I found all this out after I sent the message.  I am,
unfortunately, BIOS illiterate.  But the poliferation of viruses here
at Washington University in St. Louis is forcing me to learn more
every day.  It was a "shoot from the hip" answer to very real effect

  Ummmm... I'm not sure I understand what a "ghost" virus implies, we
were never able to actually clean it off so I don't know how it could
have become a "ghost".  Also there was at least enough of it to set of
McAfee's SCAN program.

It definately does NOT have to be a virus! Are you using Virus

even after they have been formatted. It is also possible it to

Subject: Possible Mac virus? Problems need an answer. (Mac)

The directory of my hard disk keeps changing the information regarding
how much space is allocated and how much is free. Symptoms include:
copying a file to Hd from floppy, Hd indicates file is 1,700 k when
original file is only 12k. My removable drive (45 meg) said 42,050 in
disk, 69,750 free!  We've been having problems with disk space
disappearing as well. One drive looked full but when all files added
up it should have had 25 meg free. I ran various utilities including
Norton, Disinfectant 2.4., checked for invisible files (none). Can
anyone shed some light on this phenomenon? Apple tech support does't
admit a problem. These problems have occured on or llci, ll cx, and
Fx.

Also folders that won't delete. Only whenname is changed using resedit
or similar utility.  Don't know if the problmsare related or not.

The Joshi virus has been discovered on a PC at Athabasca University.
So far it appears to have been contained to the local machine.  Anyone
who has had contact with the 386 in Lewis Varga's office, please check
your system.  A copy of virus scan software is available for this
purpose.

One of the known symptoms is the floppy drives will no longer read disks
reporting that the disk has bad sectors.
