VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Introduction to the Anti-viral archives, listing of 05 December 1991

This posting is the introduction to the "official" anti-viral archives
of VIRUS-L/comp.virus.  With the generous cooperation of many sites
throughout the world, we are attempting to make available to all
the most recent news and programs for dealing with the virus problem.
Currently we have sites for Amiga, Apple II, Atari ST, IBMPC, Macintosh
and Unix computers, as well as sites carrying research papers and
reports of general interest.

If you have general questions regarding the archives, you can send
them to this list or to me.  I'll do my best to help.  If you have a
submission for the archives, you can send it to me or to one of the
persons in charge of the relevant sites.

If you have any corrections to the lists, please let me know.

The files contained on the participating archive sites are provided freely
on an as-is basis.

To the best of our knowledge, all files contained in the archives are either
Public Domain, Freely Redistributable, or Shareware.  If you know of one
that is not, please drop us a line and let us know.  Reports of corrupt
files are also welcome.

PLEASE NOTE
The Managers of these systems, and the Maintainers of the archives, CAN NOT
and DO NOT guarantee any of these applications for any purpose.  All possible
precautions have been taken to assure you of a safe repository of useful
tools.

Archive access without anonymous ftp, last changed 30 June 1991

To get files from the anti-viral archives, you do not need access
to anonymous ftp.  (However, anonymous ftp is generally the preferred
method.)  Below is information on accessing the archive sites using
only email.

                           -=-

One way to get access to the archives is through the BITFTP server
at Princeton.  Send a message to the BITNET address is BITFTP@PUCC
with the body of the message containing the single word HELP.  This
should get you more information, and give you access to any archive
site on the Internet.  Due to excessive loads, this service has been
restricted to BITNET and EARN sites only.  UUCP sites need not apply.

                           -=-

Both the AppleII and the Atari ST archives have mail servers which
provide access to their archives.  You may receive automatic updates
of Macintosh anti-viral programs via email.  See the individual articles
on these sites.

                           -=-

You may also retrieve files from the SIMTEL-20 and the INFO-MAC
archives by using one of the many mail servers which maintain
a shadow archive of these sites.  Send the following message to one
of the listserv sites.

help

See the IBMPC and Macintosh articles for a complete list of servers.
