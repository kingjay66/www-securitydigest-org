Oh, how true, how true.  And the *egos* involved ... !

Having recently been tech support manager for KEA systems, I rather
dreaded the day that I had to inform a customer that they were infected.
I knew it would happen, as the product had a very distinctive error
message if it became infected with a file infector.  In actual fact, the
one time I had to do it, the caller was very pleased to be informed of
it, and eagerly asked advice on antiviral software and procedures.  (I
was pleasantly surprised.)

I would like to add some experiences in a related field.  Shortly after I
opened the antiviral area on SUZY, and only yesterday from Cyberstore, I
got calls from the staff relaying messages from users who stated they had
become infected with a virus by using the online service.  Of course, in
both cases the virus was "Stoned", and in both cases I informed both the
staff and the user that it was impossible unless they were a) technically
competent enough to know better than to do that and b) willing
participants in their own infection.  (Yes, it *is* possible to transfer
a BSI via BBS.  But you havwe to try pretty hard.)

Goodonya.  Please do.  As I hope my iterated refrain in the anitviral
reviews has pointed out, I am appalled at the commercial software houses
who still insist on sending out disks which are not only writable, but
lack any write protection at all.  (Yes, I realize that shareware authors
do not have access to the type of disk duplication hardware that can
write on "notchless" disks.  i encourage all of you who do deal in
shareware to write protect disks before you send them out.  My real
contempt is reserved for the commercials who have access to the
resources, and simply can't be bothered.  Or who like fancy copy
protection schemes better than security for us peons.)

 Fascinating.  That's exactly how Mark Washburn's SECURE program
 works under MS DOS, only I was led to believe here that SECURE
 wasn't useful.  Could it be that such methods, first pioneered by
 Ross Greenberg in FluShot, and then expanded by Washburn in SECURE,
 are a good way of doing things, after all?  Better than string
 scanning?

 I always thought it was better, but with all the protestations here,
 I had more or less given it up.  Should we retake the subject of
 SECURE, then?  If it's good, then we should look at it much more
 carefully, even as a model for other antivirus software.

 Me too, but sometimes they help to clarify things.

 My original post was in response to people who said that `interpreted
 mode' viruses could still attack under conditions that protected
 executables. I replied that such `interpreted viruses' would be
 easier to combat;  one reason I advanced for this belief was that
 they probably couldn't become furtive ("stealth") viruses.

 No known statistical correlation, but I say we don't really know
 whether there is no relationship in fact.  Only a few viruses are
 really widespread, and ONE of them IS furtive ("stealth").  It so
 happens that the furtive widepread virus is also the oldest virus
 known, so its width of spread MAY be due to time, not furtiveness.

 It looked suggestive to me. The other viruses that are widespread
 are not furtive, true. But they are also old viruses, while most
 furtive ones are much newer. So, while we don't KNOW that, given
 equal time, the furtive viruses might not become VERY widespread
 or that furtiveness is not a factor in virus spread, neither do
 we know the reverse to be true.

 Besides experience with old (non-interpreted) viruses, one may
 rightfully use other (speculative) criteria when considering those
 new, yet-to-be-written, speculative interpreted viruses. And that's
 the kind of consideration that was being made.

 I think the most obvious reason is that viruses themselves are
 the creature of programmers, and so are antiviruses. Since we are
 in a programmer's-devised environment, both attacks and defenses
 tend to be programmer-devised also.

 Of course more people are protecting their machines with software;
 that's what the antivirus suppliers have mainly been feeding to the
 public.  It's the only widely-available protection against the
 widely-promoted threat, and the public panic, trigered by the same
 antivirus publishers.  Shouldn't loose sight of those facts.

 Any "popularity" of software protection is -totally- unrelated to
 effectiveness. It's due to promotion, availability and distribution.

 People are not protecting their machines with hardware for the same
 reason they are not protecting them with angel-wing feathers:
 both are effective, but difficult to find.  Most important, neither
 one has been getting the daily promotion to millions of users that
 software antiviruses get via free advertising on 60,000 BBS.
 That's unrelated to effectiveness.

 It costs nearly nothing to duplicate software, so free samples are
 cheap to produce.  And somebody else (i.e., the BBSs) advertise
 and distribute them for free.  That's another reason people use them,
 because it costs them nothing to try.  They have ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA
 whether it's effective or not.  The have absolutely NO WAY TO
 MEASURE whether the antivirus software is of any use whatsoever.
 In fact, much of the time, it's unprovable placebo. Nothing to do
 with effectiveness.

 The fact that they are using it hasn't done one thing to stop
 viruses from spreading.  Unrelated to effectiveness, again.

 Sure. I'm human. I don't like to be contradicted any more than the
 next fellow; there's no shame in admitting that.  But I try to handle
 contradiction in a mature way, not by demeaning oponents with
 personal remarks, as we've seen done here (not from you, I hasten
 to say).

 Write-protect tabs are not `near'-perfect - they ARE perfect.
 Totally, not just `near'; there's no software bypass of a write-
 protect tab.  True, a write-protected disk cannot be updated. True,
 the inconvenience of using only write-protected disks is
 overwhelming.  So, we have to make them a little less perfect...
 I never said we should just look at the write-protect tab and STOP
 THERE... I offered it as an illustration, a starting point. After
 all, I propose not Virus-Proof Machines, but only Virus-Resistant
 ones... remember?    :-)

 Unfortunately, some `open minds' became noticeably nervous at this
 point and the conversation, instead of evolving, became derailed.
 Which, I suspect, is what the `open minds' may have wanted in the
 first place.

Subject: Viruses and "viruses"

Writes UH2M@DKAUNI2.BITNET (Axel Gutmann):

 > ...biological viruses don't neccessarily need an active host to
 > survive - consider tobacco-mosaic virus-crystals -

 The great majority of viruses do not resemble the so-called tobacco
 mosaic virus.  Tobacco mosaic virus seems to be at the boundary
 between `crystallizable' protein and live organisms.  In fact,
 because it can be `crystallized' and remain active in such form,
 I would tend to classify it not as a living organism, but as a
 chemical... "anomaly".   This is not at all difficult to do  (a
 "malchemical"...?  ouch!).

 Most live viruses ARE highly labile. They usually cannot stay alive
 for any long time outside of a host, not to speak of reproducing by
 themselves.  True, some few can survive.  But ALL computer "viruses"
 can, and do, exist by themselves and can even be endlessly
 "reproduced" (copied) without any need for "hosts"!

 The mosaic virus is a bad example. We should keep in mind that there
 are many such "borderline" cases in science.  At some point, it
 becomes difficult to distinguish between animals and vegetals, but
 we emphatically distinguish between the two at all other levels.

 I think it's bad thinking and bad practice to make emphasis on such
 borderline cases to draw analogies between the extremes.  They are
 curiosities and exceptions, not rules.  Analogies drawn from them
 will be plainly inaccurate, as is the analogy between biological
 viruses and computer "viruses".

 > The analogy that's most important in this discussion is the

 In that's the important analogy, then the differences far outweigh
 the similarities. Computer viruses are not independent organisms.
 They are the intentional product of ill-willing programmers. They
 do not evolve as part of a natural environment. They are grossly
 artificial. Their complexity is several ORDERS of MAGNITUDE smaller
 than that of even the simplest virus.

 Whereas the spread of real viruses can be studied and conclusions
 drawn from their study, computer "viruses" are manipulated by their
 authors and distributors, and their spread may have nothing at all
 to do with their "ability to spread", or with whether they are
 "stealthed" or not, or whether they infect this or that.

 Anytime a virus author feels that his "creature" is not spreading
 fast enough, he can add a dozen new ones. If the virus was
 unsuccessful, he can "repair" it instantly and we have a new,
 "evolved" (sic) "strain" (sic).  In other words, viruses ARE NOT
 organisms, the are the PRODUCTS OF organisms.

 But if we are ignorant of the "seeding" mechanism, (as we are in
 practice) and if we are ignorant of many aspects of the "transport"
 mechanism (as we also are), and if "reproduction" may actually be
 nothing but repeated artificial "seeding", HOW can we even think of
 drawing parallels?  Where, I ask, is the analogy between this and
 natural viruses?  HOW can we speak of analogies?  Ill-applied
 equations.  False parallels.

 In my opinion, the main reason antivirus publishers (and the news
 editors...) are insisting on keeping the false parallel between real
 viruses and computer "viruses" is for its psychological effect,
 certainly not out of any kind of scientific necessity!  Witness, for
 example, the lingo that has developed among those who study computer
 "viruses": "infection"; "to isolate" (not to copy) a "specimen" (not
 a file); "strains" (not revised programs); even I, myself, am caught
 writing about "taxonomy" as if the damn things were some kind of
 natural entities!

 The habit is pervasive, and plays to the public's imagination. And
 THAT is its main value, a commercial one.  Also, it plays to
 programmers' vanity, because it allows them to feel that they are
 the "creators" of "living creatures", i.e., that they are gods in
 some way. Considering the size of some of the egos that populate
 this environment, THAT might very well be the main cause...    :-)

 > I'd like to do to old STONED what we did to the smallpox-virus!

 Easy. A vaccination for the Stoned has existed for a long time.
 Several, in fact.  Use it on your diskettes, and the Stoned will
 never attack them.          :-)

Subject: F-Prot 2.01 (PC)

I have some questions/wish list for F-Prot.

1. I have a lot of clients who work on their stand-alone computer
   for quite some time and then decide to access a network. They
   load virstop.exe at boot time but then at network time, the load
   gets rejected with an "already installed" message. Couldn't
   virstop.exe disable its first copy and then reload itself?
   (P.S.: Until this problem is resolved, I'm still loading
    f-driver.sys from version 1.16 at boot time, then virstop.exe
    at network login in).

2. What are we suppose to do with the file virstop.bin?  It's exactly
   identical to virstop.exe and both can be loaded at boot time.

3. I would like a new f-test.exe so that I can test if virstop.exe
   worksa once installed in memory. There are so many ways to install
   TSRs nowadays and so many operating systems, that it is necessary
   to find out if it works. Just the fact that a program loads doesn't
   mean success!

4. What's the command line switch to remove virstop.exe from memory?
   (It's useful if you want to detach yourself from Novell without
   rebooting).

Thank you for listening.

It is called SoftPC, by Insignia Software. And it *does* run ibm software,

As a matter of fact, the emulation is good enough that viruses *are* able to
infect and transmit.  As has been recently discussed on the INFO-MAC discussion
list, ibm virus scanners are required (and work well) while running SoftPC
or SoftAT.  (Mac virus scanners are useless in defeating pc viruses, they
just cannot recognize anything is happening..)

Several people on the info-mac stated for fact that their mac had been the
transfer point for a couple of ibm viruses, transmitted while running either
SoftPC or SoftAT.

Subject: A couple questions (Mac) (Commodore)

I was reading the article about alternatives to virus protection
programs. Ones that will work.

Well, I use this MacIntosh SE that the school has provided me and it
works nicely, but recently my roommate erased all of the anti-viral
programs and thus I was prone for an attack, which occurred. An OLD
virus, nVIR B, hit. No biggie, but the ANTI-virus program VIRUS
DETECTIVE removed the virus resource, but didn't redirect the
pointers, so I had a useless System, Finder, and Term program.

I also own a Commodore 128. Strangely, over the 6 years I have had it
I have never once had a single virus in it. Recently a few trojan
horses appeared, but they were easy to spot.

What makes the difference between the two is this, one is constantly
on - going from one application to another, while the other has to
constantly be shut off.  On a Mac, (OR IBM for that matter) if you
want to increase the ANTI-virus protection, just after EACH
application shut the system off. The virus MAY still spread, but then
again, it may not.

Another reason why my Commodore can't be infected is that it has its
DOS in ROM not in a modifyable DISK which is then loaded into RAM.
Both are loaded into RAM, but on the Commodore, it cannot be changed
with software.

Just a thought,

: precisely because file access is so slow on floppies.

True, the scanning process itself takes the same amount of time.  The
speed difference is from the access time on the floppy drive.  I have
some users who do not want to know that their system is checking
for viruses except when it finds one.  The problem is that the time for
scanning programs and file copies is noticable, if slight.  At
least, they tell me it is noticable.

According to my users, those pesky little milliseconds add up. ;-)

They are willing to accept some speed degradation from the floppy
because floppies are slow anyway, and not used that often.  If being
a little slower on floppy access is the price of relative safety,
that's OK; as long as it doesn't interfere with the user.

Since they have allowed the virus protectors and checkers to test
their hard disk at power up time, they are confident that the HD
is clean.  Whether they can actually perceive the extra time to scan
programs from a hard disk load, or a network load, I don't know.
But they know it is happening and they know it takes some time
and they don't want to spend the time double/triple checking
files they know are clean.

Fortunately, the current version of VSHIELD from McAfee (for instance)
has command line options to limit which drives are checked on
program loads.  If vendors keep adding features, I may someday
have happy users. ;-)  Then again, some users always want more.

It is a question of perception rather than actual effeciency.  I 1 or 2
minute check at power up time means there is time for a cup of coffee
before throwing the brain in gear.  A perceived delay every time the
user runs a program is sand in the gearbox.  My users have asked for
a way to maintain relative health without checking each and every
file on each and every load or copy.  Since most infections come via
floppies, restricting the checking to loads or copies from floppy
seemed acceptable.

I have learned that v84 of McAfee's VSHIELD has command line options
to restrict which drives checks are done on.

Doubt it - the Jerusalem (& any other virus that follows DOS Disk access
techniques) will work just fine. What is going to have trouble is anything
that tries to lock/access the FAT directly.

Same comment. Incidently DiskSecure works just fine with SuperStore etc
as do the other products I have tested (VSHIELD, Virus-Safe, etc.) VSHIELD
does have a problem loading high with DRDOS 6.0 but have been promised a
fix.

Have had more problems trying to install Windows (have WordStar for Windows
coming in & was SuperStor impetus) since each time I try to load it, the
installation blows up & am left with a corrupt disk. DR wasn't surprised
& I suppose I am just going to have to "trick" something. Whoopie.

Incidently, DS I protects itself, the MBR, hidden sectors, & the DOS boot
record - I do not understand why something else (mentioned in this issue
but I forget the name) would have a problem - to me it would be *more*
difficult to just protect part of a disk. DS II will just allow
extension of write protection to a whole disk just like DS I
prevents BIOS (not DOS) formats to any track. RSN 8*).
