I saw a similar problem on a machine which has a Disinfectant Preferences
file which had been configured for Scanning Station Mode (which is supposed
to behave this way).
Discard the prefs file and try again.

Subject: Joshi & Stoned 2 (PC)

   My IBM PC has been hit with 2 viruses, Stoned-2 and Joshi.  The
computer hangs when we try to boot, and now it looks as if the
hard-disk has been affected.

   What long range effects do these viruses have on recovering files
from the Hard-disk?  I have never heard of Joshi.  I thought Stoned-2
just affected the boot-up.  Do either of these viruses affect the FATS
table or somehow make recovery of disk files impossible?  How about
using something like Norton utilities to get these files off the disk?
Are we totally screwed?

   The guy that is "curing" the problem indicated that the
two viruses in combination created some sort of unique problem
and that Joshi may be a "Friday the 13th" type bomb.

   Any info, on the list or direct to me would be appreciated.
Thanks very much.  We are in the Central California area, BTW.

Further to my earlier posting, I got ahold of a copy of McAfee's SCAN
program, and it confirmed that the [Stoned] Virus was still affecting
my hard drive.  So I have now managed to cure the problem, and for
what it's worth to anyone, if interested, here's how:

1) I rebooted the system off my floppy system disks (DOS 3.3) which I had COPY
   PROTECTED!  I then backed up all the files onto floppy disks using XCOPY
   making sure that I had removed drive "C" from the environment path
   variable;

2) I opened the Partitiion Table and Boot Sector with the Norton Utilities;

3) I OVERWROTE the entire partition table with "0", and wrote it to the disk;

4) I then repartitioned the disk using FDISK;

5) I then reformatted the disk from the system floppies like so -
	A> format c: /v/s

6) I scanned all floppy disks with the McAfee program PRIOR to copying them to
   the hard drive.  Where I found an infected disk, I repeated the same
   treatment I had given the hard disk with Norton Utilities.  (You can copy
   the files from a floppy of which you have overwritten the Boot Sector
   provided that you are careful NOT to overwrite the FAT) and
   then reformatted them from the system floppies (which I knew to be clean).

7) The problem is solved.  The PC is now, according to the McAfee program,
   clean!  And the RAMDRIVER is loading a-ok.

Hope this helps anyone else who has been infected by the [Stoned]
virus.  (By the way, I don't know if you've noticed but the person who
wrote the message "Your PC is Stoned! LEGALISE MARIJUANA!"  doesn't
even know how to spell legalize.......heh! heh!  And I'll bet he
thinks he's smart.)

And one other thing, a warning!  I think I picked up the virus from a
fairly reputable software company's disks that I purchased several
months ago - a word processor, no less!  It looks like some this major
company may have a snake in the woodpile.  I can't mention their name
here, however I will be taking my case up with them so that they can
call in the mongoose brigade.

But be warned!  These stupid viruses come from the most unexpected and
innocent places!  Check everything.  If you don't have a copy of a
good scan program, I would suggest that you get one.

Only one problem with that idea: How can the machine tell when a disk
is inserted?  There isn't any type of sensor in IBM floppy drives like
in the Mac.

F-DRIVER does not check the disk per se, but when the boot process starts
F-DRIVER, it will check memory for any resident viri.  It will then
terminate the boot process, forcing you to boot from a clean disk.

Someone recently explained this, although I can't remember the terms
he used for the different "processes".  Again, though, if you stick
the disk in the A: drive and power on, "reset" or <Ctrl><Alt><Del>,
then the program on the boot sector of the A: drive disk will be
loaded.  Even on a "non-system" disk there is a program in the boot
sector.  It usually prints "Non-system disk.  Replace and press any
key to continue" on the screen.  A BRAIN infected disk will load BRAIN
into memory *and then* run that message.  You remove the disk and
replace with the proper system disk and hit a key, and the machine
"boots" the proper system files *but BRAIN is still active.*

And, of course, infects any disk it reads from then on.

> Does anybody know what the typical virus scanner looks for in

Interesting that the (c) BRAIN label doesn't show up on your disks.  As
BRAIN was one of the very early viri, and fairly obtrusive, it is also
one of the most widely "altered" viri.  However, if you have a version
that is even *close* to the original, most of the scanners should find
it.  The early "hackers" didn't do much messing with it's core code.

You can probably it yourself.  PCTOOLS, F-BOOT and many other utilities
will "show" you the boot sector contents, and there is a lot of text in
BRAIN so it should be obvious.  (You can even do it with DEBUG if you can
find the right numbers.)

Disinfection is fairly easy.  F-DISINF works perfectly, SCAN/D should
work OK, even good old SYS will take care of BRAIN.  Provided you "boot
clean" first.

 I beleive that a way to "vaccinate" a Mac against nVir is to create a
resource with the nVir type and when nVir tries to infect it, it bumps
into the nVir resource already there and fails.
 If I am wrong, please correct me everyone.. Thanks.

Subject: Info on resident virus scanner. (PC)

    This is in response to your posting on VIRUS-L.
    I think a McAfee program called VSHIELD may be just what you
are looking for. The program, once loaded, scans all COM, EXE, and
OVR files as well as any files being copied, etc. It has the added
feature of scanning the floppy drive whenever a warm boot is
requested, to prevent any inadvertent introduction of viri if
an infected disk is accidently left in the drive.
    You should be able to download this from several archives
in the UK. Check Virus-L back logs for a full listing of
archive sites. The file will be named VSHIELD72.ZIP.

Subject: discovering 170x infection path (PC)

hello hunters |

During autumn I worked out a TurboPascal 5.5 ( without OOP , so just
5.0 ) program , that tries to show the infection path of a group of
infections with the 1701/1704 Virus , found with (no brackets) (170X)
when using SCAN.  The virus stores the 32-bit system clock from
0040:006C or something like that, --> ( you get the TIME when the
virus gets resident )

 2) it stores the jump instruction to the eof from the previous infection
    ( so you get the length of the previous infected file while being resident)

 3) and all the original interrupt-vectors , so you can seperate different envi
    ronments while infections occured

 4) the original length of the current infected file

all that stuff quite simple programmed.

Now I want to know : IS this interesting enough to be posted in the
VIRUS-L archives ???

Subject: obscure procedure in Yankee Doodle (PC)

hello virus-proofed community |

Last week i found the ( or a ) oh-so-old-but-never-found Yankee Doodle
Virus at a friend , savely jailed on a floppy disk.

I worked through the code quite heavy ,found nothing unbelieveable
clever but : after copying the virus-code to the top of memory ( i
worked hard to figure out the meaning of TOM in recent issues) , it
gets the size of the absolute system memory for DOS from a word in the
BIOS-segment ( 280h) multiplies this by various things to get the end
of memory ( A000:0000 )

AND THEN ::: checksums 61 words starting from A000:014E ( or 012E ,
i'm not sure without the source next to me ) , simply adding all these
61 words together , and if the result is something like 0b52 , it
writes a jump instruct ion into high memory , pointing to a small
procedure which changes Int 13h (disk interupt).

On my system ( a 286 Neat with 2 MB Ram running at 20 MHz 1 WS ) there
is nothing accessible after a000:0000 , everything just HIGH-VALUE
(FFh), not possible to change a byte .

I tried using Shadow RAM enabled at A000  , but that also failed .

SO THE ONE AND ONLY QUESTION :

Are there systems where this part of memory is accessible or would the
virus just overwrite a resident other virus when the value in the
BIOS-segment is below 280h due to a previous (already running)
infection ?

                                 Please many answers and soon , i'm puzzled

                                 Sincerly yours , Martin

Repartitioning and reformatting is a rather drastic way to deal with
"Stoned".  F-PROT and SCAN will both remove the infection fairly
easily.  However, none of these measures will be effective if the
virus is still resident in memory.  You can repartition all you like,
"Stoned" will just pop right back in to your "clean" system unless you
first boot from a clean source.

Also, did you check your floppy disks?

I'm not sure they are related either.  You say "Stoned" "appeared" on
Christmas Day: how do you know that?  Are you referring to the "Your
PC is now Stoned" message?  If so, you should know that the infection
could have occured long before that.  The message only appears on "1
in 8" boots, and its appearance is randomly generated.  It might have
been in your system for a long time before you got the message.

I suggest you get a copy of F-PROT and check your system *and* floppy
disks again.  Since you are in Canada, you get antiviral programs and
information from the SUZY Information Service.  Check out the
INtegrity section of the Information Networks.

Are you saying that he is worried about getting an infection, in some
way, on his PC from an IBM mainframe running VM?  If so, he can stop
worrying, for some time at least.  I assume he would be using some
kind of terminal emulation package rather than being linked in some
sort of network situation, but the worst that could happen is to act
as a carrier for some sort of "mail virus/worm".  That would still be
the case whether or not he used a terminal in place of a PC, and
whether or not he called in from outside, and would not affect his PC
at all.  (And in any case, it would be your problem.  :-) )

Since I posted this I have been in touch with Word Perfect.  They
have, apparently, not had any major reports of this type.  Also *I
have made some error* or this bug is intermittent.  I swear I
reproduced it ten times the day I found it, but I haven't been able to

Anyway, to some up everything: 1) no, we still don't have any evidence
for a Word Perfect specific virus; 2) operator errors or disk
corruption can affect document files and 3) "there are some programs,
Dr. Slade, man was not meant to delve into!"  :-)
