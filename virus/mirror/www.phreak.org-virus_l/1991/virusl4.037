VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

I used to think that this would work also but was chagrined (shimatta)
to learn that many PC BIOSes check for floppy A as part of POST and
will generate a "601" error and halt the boot process if drive A does
not respond to the controller.

True, it is probably more difficult for an amateur but orders of
magnatude less than producing a good word processor. Also in the PC, a
user must request a boot/execution of a virus while a MAC will execute
floppy code without being asked. The "scan on floppy insertion" is
possible (and should be a part of any good protection scheme) on the
PC, it just hasn't been done yet (or has it, I am sometimes behind ?).

Yup, confidentiality can be preserved with encryption, but only
hardware can protect from destruction (if there is no FAT, it isn't
DOS). However, the same software that redirects tables can also
disallow writing to them.  The question is one of risk vs cost just
like the fact that experiments I have been making can be defeated
easily manually if it is known to be there. Easy for a skilled person
but very difficult for software unless directly targetted.  The user
has to decide the level of protection necessary and the price that is
willing to be paid. My point is that a "normal" PC has NO defense and
that quite a good level of protection from malicious software can be
had with "simple" software techniques.

Incidently, if a high level of CIA (confidentiality, integrity, &
availability) is needed, Mr. Bosen's products are very good. (personal
opinion).

General Description:

VPCSCAN is a virus detection and disinfection product.  It will remove
some viri from files or optionally delete the file if it cannot be
disinfected.  Disinfection or deletion is at user control.  VIREXPC is a
"resident" "activity" and "change detection" program which checks for
formatting calls, direct disk writes, TSR initiation, "registration" of
programs, "checksum" changes or program specific (user defined)
prohibited operations.  (During this review, Virex-PC refers to the
whole package, VIREX-PC to the TSR vaccine program only.)

Ross Greenburg was one of the first to produce an anti-viral product,
Flu-Shot.  Microcom's Virex product for the Macintosh is also well
established.  SCANDEMO, a "scan only" demonstration product, is
available free of charge on some electronic bulletin board systems.

Please, when reading this review, note a built in bias towards Ross
Greeburg's work.           Comparison of features and specifications



User Friendliness

Installation

Disks shipped write protected.  Documentation stresses the importance of
write protecting the disks, suggests making "working copy" of the
original disk, and checking the computer system with VPCSCAN before
making installation onto the hard disk, but the suggested procedure
could leave the "working copy" infected.

Installation requires the Virex-PC diskette in drive A:, regardless of
which drive it is invoked from.  If you wish to install the program onto
a "boot floppy", the diskette to be installed "to" must be in drive B:.

Effective installation is impossible without reading the documentation
and understanding the concepts and system configuration thoroughly.  The
documentation is complete and quite clear, but "naive" users may find
the number of functions and features, and the explanations, daunting to
tackle.

Subsequent to installation, the "Protection File" can be editted.
However, the "README" file notes that this should not be done while
VIREX-PC is active, and if you invoke VIREX-PC automatically at boot
time, you will have to boot from a floppy in order to modify your
protection.

Ease of use

Once installed, the system operates without intervention, unless viral
activity is detected.  The alert screens are clear and informative.  The
decisions necessary, and the usefulness or "hindrance" of the system
depends largely on the installation, which should be "matched" to the
experience of the user.

VPCSCAN's screen display shows the files checked individually, but
continues to display the directories checked until the screen is full,
so that a number of directories can be seen at once.  This is much
clearer than the practice of other programs which only display one file
at a time, or only the directories checked, especially given the speed
of VPCSCAN's operation.

Help systems

Alert screens contain somewhat esoteric, but very complete information
on the activity taking place.  This will be very helpful to expert
users, but even novices will find it easier to make an "informed"
decision on whether or not to allow an operation.

Compatibility

VPCSCAN, in contrast to the lists known to SCAN and FPROT, finds
relatively few viri.  Those that it does find, however, would likely
account for better than 99% of actual infections.  The manual states
that updates are made quarterly, and that registered users will receive
"notification" of updates.  (According to the registration cards,
updates will be $25 each, or you may receive a year's "subscription" for
$75.)  However, it is now three months (one "quarter") since I
registered my copy, and I have yet to receive any notification.  (It is
possible, although improbable, that this period exactly coincides with
one "update period.")

Although one of the standard alerts in the package is for "direct writes
to diskette", and even though the Stoned/New Zealand virus is one which
VPCSCAN will identify (although not disinfect), VIREX-PC was not able to
protect against, and did not warn of, infection by the Stoned virus.
Although VIREX-PC will make a checksum of disk or diskette boot sectors,
it does not checksum partition boot records.

Company Stability

Microcom is a stable and diverisfied company, if somewhat samller than a
Lotus or Microsoft.  Virex for the Mac has been around for some time,
although it is not one fo the current "leaders" among Mac antivirals.
Ross Greenburg was one of the first to write an antiviral program for
MS-DOS (Flu-Shot) and it is still a viable program.

Company Support

Virex-PC was the third to arrive of all the commercial programs I had
requested for review.  Microcom had no problems with shipping across the
border, although the package did arrive crushed.

Note also the lack of update notification for the period specified.

Documentation

Very good (clear, concise) section on general virus information.

The procedure given in the Quick Start section could produce an infected
"working copy" of the Virex-PC disk.

The installation "prompts" are no better or worse than others reviewed,
but the documentation explains all options very clearly, both in terms
of the options available, and the reasons for the options.

Hardware Requirements

There are no special hardware requirements.

Performance

VPCSCAN is amazingly fast.  File checking is at least twice as fast as
either FPROT or SCAN across all platforms tested.

VIREX-PC has more options than other vaccine type programs, as well as
change detection capabilities.  However, although one of the standard
alerts in the package is for "direct writes to diskette", and even
though the Stoned/New Zealand virus is one which VPCSCAN will identify
(although not disinfect), VIREX-PC was not able to protect against, and
did not warn of, infection by the Stoned virus.  Although VIREX-PC will
make a checksum of disk or diskette boot sectors, it does not checksum
partition boot records.

Local Support

No provisions.

Support Requirements

The installation and operation of VIREX-PC and VPCSCAN should not be
beyond the average intelligent user who is willing to spend time with
the manual before installation.  However, in supported environments, it
would be best to have the support staff perform installation.

                          General Notes

Although in many respects a superior product, the inability to prevent
infection by the ubiquitous "Stoned" virus must be seen as a failing.
However, Virex-PC will detect the "Stoned" virus, and, with some care,
recovery can take place without recourse to other specialised products.

General Description:

A simple and relatively inexpensive virus scanning and disinfecting
program.  The menu driven interface provides a number of useful options,
including on-screen virus information.

           Comparison of features and specifications



User Friendliness

Installation

Installation is clear and straightforward, being simply the copying of
the program and related files to the appropriate disk or area.  Although
the manual indicates installation is to be done from drive A:, it can be
performed from any drive, and to any drive, including floppies.
Installation takes a longer time than one might think, given the
elementary copying operation, but the installation program is clear and
"well prompted".

Ease of use

Operation is easier than the manual indicates.  The default settings are
well chosen, and although there are command line switches and options
that can be set on screen, they merely provide alternate avenues to the
same operations.  All options are available as menu items, and the menu
interface provides a sense of being "in command" with all functions at
the user's fingertips.  Prompts are clear and informative.

The "3-D windowing", although attractive, does, at times, clutter the
screen and distract from the functionality by overlaying and higlighting
portions of the menus that are not currently being used.

Help systems

There is no "help" per se, but the program is easy enough to use that
this should not be a problem.  One decided advantage is the "Virus Info"
window, which provides a list of viri, and will bring up two or three
paragraphs of information on selected viri.  While useful to a novice or
intermdiate user, this function does not require extensive disk space,
as it is simply a "boilerplate" expansion of the McAfee VIRINFO.TXT
table which is supplied with the disk.  (Indeed, do not make the mistake
of deleting this file under the impression that it serves no purpose.)

Compatibility

Virucide will detect all of the most common viri, and is roughly "level"
in that regard to most commercial products, although it lags behind such
scanners as SCAN and FPROT.  Given the association between Virucide and
McAfee Associates, this is rather odd.  (Version 2.0 of Virucide is
dated January 28, 1991, but the copyright date on the VIRINFO.TXT file
is 1989.)  However, a "current" version of Virucide should prove
effective against better than 99% of viri encountered.

Company Stability

Parson's Technology is a mid sized software distribution house, with a
very wide selection of products.

Company Support

Of the first group of commercial vendors contacted, Virucide was the
first product actually received for review.  Having received the May
1990 version in December, I received the January 1991 version in mid
February as a "free upgrade".  I have seen numerous references by users
of other Parsons' products to superior customer service.

Documentation

The documentation is clear and concise, but at times makes the product
appear to be more difficult to use than is actually the case.  There is
no general discussion of viral operation.

Hardware Requirements

No special hardware required.

Performance

As above, Virucide has no particular strengths, or weaknesses, in speed
of operation or numbers of viri detected.

Local Support

No provisions.

Support Requirements

For general installation and operation, Virucide should not need any
support.  The novice user should be able to use the system as is, and
the intermediate user will be able to make better use of the options
available.

                          General Notes

The only advantage that the advanced user will find in Virucide is the
"Virus Info" window as a "ready reference".  However, as a "quick check"
for novice or intermediate users, the product deserves consideration.
