I've found out a few more things about the virus found on the
Compuserve Virus Forum.

It's known as: Taiwan 4 or Anticad, and some detectors call it a
Jerusalem variant, or a Plastique variant.  This virus's trigger is
when a program named "ACAD.EXE" (a popular CAD program) is executed,
at which time this virus goes into action and the file ACAD.EXE gets
overwritten and deleted. This virus is almost identical to the
Plastique 2576 (aka Anticad 2576) virus, except that it's a little
longer due to different verbage appearing when the virus activates.

It could be just a multiple infection with two slightly different
versions of JOSHI virus. JOSHI virus hides an original BOOT sector and
the rest of itself to the fixed location (on floppy it formats an
additional track, on hard disk uses sectors starting with head 0, cyl.
0, sec. 2). It checks whether the disk is already infected by
comparing BOOT code with its own BOOT code. Suppose a disk was
infected with one version of JOSHI (let's call it JOSHI-A). Then BOOT
sector has been hidden to fixed location and JOSHI-A's BOOT is written
to BOOT sector. Now suppose this disk was accessed on a PC infected
with a slightly different version of JOSHI - JOSHI-B. JOSHI-B will
decide that disk is not infected since both versions are not equal
byte-to-byte. JOSHI-B will then reinfect the disk, overwriting the
original hidden BOOT with a copy of JOSHI-A.  So, original non-virus
BOOT will be lost and where both of JOSHIs (and anti-virus programs as
well!) expect it to be in fact resides JOSHI-A. Such a disk becomes
not bootable - an infinite loop will take place. When JOSHI-B is
removed by this or that anti-virus JOSHI-A is restored to BOOT sector.
This is a deadlock - removing JOSHI-A from the BOOT an anti-virus will
restore it back from where an original BOOT is supposed to be. If an
anti-virus program repeat scanning and removing until no (known)
viruses are found, then it can either trap to an infinite loop (I know
such programs) or understand that this disk cannot be repaired since
it meats the same virus twice (this applies only to viruses, hiding
BOOT to a FIXED location).

So I think this problem has nothing to do with a version of DOS.

Thank you, Padget, for the lucid and thorough explanation you have
given on account of this question. However, one particular point is
not entirely clear to me. You wrote

> ... On a floppy it is better to copy the disk (being careful not to
> reboot) and reformat it.

When dealing with a boot sector virus (or multiple boot sector virus
infections), you can copy **the files** from the disk (being careful
not to reboot) and then reformat the old one. In MS-DOS, you can use
one of the commands COPY and XCOPY, or one of several file copying
utilities. It goes without saying (but cannot be stressed too often)
that you have to obey what I have dubbed "The Golden Rule of the Trade":
you have to boot from a clean system disk before you start. It would
also be a good idea to format the target disk after you have booted
cleanly, as the disks around that infected computer tend to have been
infected, as well (or is it "as badly"? :-)

Now for my doubts: What will happen if you copy **the disk** (your
wording) via the DISKCOPY command? Will it copy the infected boot
sector, or will it leave it behind? What will happen to the fake "bad"
sectors, many boot sector viruses exploit? I had not the time to test
it, and if I tested it, it would only be for one or two DOS versions.
The DOS user manual is vague in that respect (as usual).

As long as this is not answered, I'd recommend to use XCOPY in cases
like this.

Hello,

As an interested but fairly un educated virus watcher and network
supervisor I would like to thank all the virus researchers for their
work.  There have been few virus outbreaks here on the Univ. of Utah
campus so far, mostly in MAC's (so there).

I've followed the topic of virus detection/disinfection/elimination
software testing with interest.  I've been helping evaluate different
virus software packages here but have been a little frustrated.  Ease
of use, screen displays and all that are of interest but product
functionality is more important.  The idea of a third party evaluation
of the functions of the products is quite interesting.  I hope that
something happens with that idea.

A few messages back someone mentioned something about Novell servers
using DOS interrupts.  In pre-386 versions of Netware DOS was
replaced, interrupts and all, by Netware.  With the 386 versions DOS
may be unloaded from the server after Netware is started with the
SECURE CONSOLE command or from the RCONSOLE screen.  I don't know if
that removes/replaces the DOS interrupts.  Since you can return to DOS
after downing the server (assuming you didn't secure the console) I
suspect it doesn't replace them.

Thanks for your attention.

There are several Soviet disinfectors (and my own one as well) which
fight both of these viruses very well.

AIDSTEST by Lozinsky is one of the best and, with no doubts, the most
widespread. It is no longer free, though its price is just symbolic.
Since there is still no law against software pirating in the USSR,
almost all Soviet users have non-licensed copies of AIDSTEST. New
versions of AIDSTEST are updated approximately twice in a month. The
last - v152 - covers several hundreds of different viruses, including
two or three dozens of Soviet beasties.

Most of Soviet viruses are too poor written to be widespread.  It
seems to be a common rule - if a virus is poor written it tends to
cause a damage - delete files, destroy system areas on disks, format
them etc. Such viruses are dangerous but queekly eliminated. And vice
versa - if a virus is more or less well done then it usually wasn't
designed to cause a damage. (Often it does due to a bugs or to a lack
of author's knowledge). So, despite a large number of Soviet viruses,
only a few of them are widespread in USSR.

I believe it is not spread, it's just known. I haven't heard of a
single infection. There were several STARSHIP infections reported.

You see, executable files are not restricted only to having .COM, .EXE
or .SYS extentions. These extentions are significant only for
COMMAND.COM or other shell program. At the level of DOS executable
files are loaded and executed according to their internal structure,
no difference what name or extention they have. For example, many
games execute .OVL or .OVR files, which are often not true overlays
from the DOS's point of view but just a regular executable files.
Picture Maker graph editor executes files having .PDR extention.  In
fact, most (but not all) executables have .COM or .EXE extention.
.SYS is usually applied for system data files (such as CONFIG.SYS or
COUNTRY.SYS) or for system drivers which are loaded before COMMAND.COM
via CONFIG.SYS.

Most of resident viruses infect programs being executed, regardless on
their extention. So, to check all possible infected files on a PC you
must set your scanner's options to check all files, or files with
certain extentions (to speed up the process) if you are sure that only
files with these extentions are executed on your system.
Nevertheless, for every day prophilctics it's usually enough to check
.COM and .EXE files only - it'll save a lot of time - since if you
have a virus it'll infect these files in any case. But when an
infection is reported - spend some more time and check *ALL* the files
on your PC.

Subject: Perfect detectors

A posting by lunde@casbah.acns.nwu.edu (Albert Lunde) said:

  "As prior threads have illustrated, a "perfect virus detector"
  is in general impossible."

     That's a reasonable corollary of the premise that 'software
  cannot overcome software'..

 " Virus scanners are not an elegant solution, but they are a
   reasonable way of producing a "good enough" solution for
   the current "state of the art" in virus writing and removal.
   Short of a change in social norms that would drastically reduce
   the rate of new virus production, there is no "light at the
   end of the tunnel" for DOS or MAC OS users... "

  However, there seems to be evidence that virus scanners are
  not really diminishing the virus threat. Several people pointed
  out that there's been a great =increase= in the total number of
  infected machines, and in the number of infections per machine
  since the scanners came out. Also, the total number of new viruses
  has increased dramatically.

  Are we seeing here a problem of social norms or another effect?

  Social norms didn't change that much in a couple of years. The
  most obvious variable seems to be the presence of antivirus
  software.  It appears that viruses and antivirus utilities have
  more or less encouraged one another in time.  What's especially
  notable is that most known viruses started to appear  =after=
  the initial appearance of scanners.

     Anyone care to elaborate or make some comments on this?

Agree, I missed this one. The only execuses are
a) this method is also some kind of a stealth technique  and
b) after such changes to BPB area, used by virus, is no longer
a FAT.

A couple of words about terminology. I use term BPB - BIOS Parameter
Block - according to "DOS Technical Reference". Vesselin Bontchev
calls it DPB - Disk Parameter Block. The latter is obviously closer to
the matter of fact, but I follow the documentation.

And if DOS does ignore BPB (DPB) than how it'll know where does a FAT
start? How will it reach Media descriptor in 1st byte of a FAT and
recognize it IS to use BPB (DPB)?

In fact DOS (or rather its Disk driver) does not ignore *ALL* the data
in BPB (DPB). It does so only if BPB seems to be invalid (as in case
of Stoned virus or diskette been formatted under DOS 1.x).  In these
cases a driver bases upon a Media decriptor from FAT, supposing FAT to
be next to Boot sector.  There are several well-known programs such as
800.COM which let to increase a capacity of a diskette by formatting
additional tracks/sectors. Being formatted under these programs a
diskette has a correct new value (>360Kb) of total sectors in BPB
(DPB) and still has 0FDH Media descriptor both in BPB and 1st byte of
FAT.

My own program succedeed to format a diskette with 1 sector FAT, 1
sector root and total capacity other than 360Kb - all parameters been
placed in BPB. This diskette still had 0FDH Media descriptor both in
BPB and FAT. I was only forced to install *TWO* copies of FAT (not
*ONE*) to make DOS treat this diskette correctly.

Beware: I'm no lawyer. There may be unmarked :-) errors in the sequel.

German penal law has been updated in 1986 to cover "damage to data".
As our law defines "damage to property" in a way that only damage to
physical objects is covered (no object-oriented programming recognized
by law :-) ), that amendmend was needed. Also there have been
amendmends on account of "Computer Fraud", because there has been a
similar dif- ficulty, as you cannot defraud a machine, and on other
issues.

Like Switzerland (and opposed to England) we have a coded law, i.e.
only if a penal rule governing the characteristics of the individual
case was in effect at the date of the very act, it can be punished. In
some cases, also the attempt will be punished (which has to be stated
in the per- tinent rule, as well).

In summary, I am aware of the following rules of our StGB (Penal Law).
(Please allow for inaccuracies or wrong technical terms due to my
limited knowledge of both German and English legal language.)

       Act:     - change data that are substantial as evidence,
                - store wrong data that are substantial as evidence,
                - use wrong data that are substantial as evidence,
                - influence EDP to yield wrong results that are ...
                - or attempt one of these
       Penalty: imprisonment up to 5 years, or fine

303a : Changing of Data
       Act:     willingly and unlawfully
                erase, suppress, render unuseful, or change data,
                or attempt to do so
       Penalty: imprisonment up to 2 years, or fine

303b : Computer Sabotage
       Act:     willingly,
                as an outsider,
                (adversely) interfere with EDP that is of substantial
                importance to a firm or enterprise or authority
                - via changing of data
                - or via damage to EDP systems or physical data media
                or attempt to do so
       Penalty: imprisonment up to 5 years, or fine

A related rule can be found in the UWG (some code applying to commercial
issues, I think UW means "unfair competition"; "G" always means "law").

17   : Disclosure of Trade Secrets
       Intent:  - personal profit
                - in favour of a third party
                - or to inflict losses on the proprietor
       Act:     - as an employee
                  disclose a trade secret to anybody
                - or as an outsider
                  obtain, provide for obtaining,
                  make unauthorized use of,
                  or disclose to anybody,
                  a trade secret
                - or attempt one of these.
       Penalty: imprisonment up to 3 years, or fine;
                in severe cases imprisonment up to 5 years, or fine

In addition, there are many rules (even several whole codes) to protect
people from improper use of person-related data, including penal rules.

I think:

- - Whoever releases any virus willingly to the public can be punished
  under paragraf 303a StGB.

- - If the virus adversely interferes with "substantial" EDP, paragraf 303
  StGB applies, raising the possible punishment.

- - In special cases (particularly designed action parts), any of the other
  paragrafs I quoted may also apply. However, this is no particular virus
  legacy; in those cases, a virus could be a possible vehicle to trans-
  port the interfering code to the target system.

- - Paragrafs 202a StGB and 17 UWG apply particularly to hacking.

Conclusion: don't attempt it :-)

Best wishes

I hope I won't be considered out of line for asking to post this.
Since the moderator has approved the postings, we must assume they
meet his guidelines for suitable material. I'm just wondering if all
that "judgmentarism" is really necessary. It detracts from the decorum
of this professional newsgroup .

I believe all issues in this discussion could be exhausted without the
frequent injection of personality we are receiving from our European
friend, who seems otherwise sincere and well-informed...  ...  :-)

There's an excellent document which offers thoughtful guidelines on
the use of newsgroups such as this one:

     USENET Rules and Etiquette, by Matt Bishop, of
     the R.I.A.C.S., NASA Ames Research Center,
     (mab@riacs.ARPA, mab@riacs.UUCP):
     [Ed. new address: Matt.Bishop@Dartmouth.edu]

[Ed. The moderator strongly encourages polite, professional
discussions and has indeed rejected many postings which were neither.
Another good source of information on this topic can be found in the
newsgroup news.announce.newusers.  In particular, take a look at Chuq
Von Rospach's article, "A Primer on How to Work With the Usenet
Community" and Brad Templeton's amusing (but very informative), "Dear
Emily Postnews".]

It contains some very good advise.
