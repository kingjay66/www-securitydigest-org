Hmm... Did the student try to boot the machine from the floppy, or run
a program on the floppy?  If the floppy had only data and no programs,
how would vshield know that Stoned was there?  On a Macintosh,
Disinfectant knows to scan every diskette because of the motor drive,
but on a DOS machine I don't understand how VSHIELD would know to
examine the diskette.

Does anyone have any information about the Miles 1986 virus?

I have received this question third-hand, and at this time I
do not even know what type of machine is infected.  However,
my sources believe it is a PC or PC-clone.

Hey, don't encourage anyone. I happen to prefer the fact that Mac
viruses are far less destructive than most MS-DOS-based viruses,
whatever the reason. I'd much rather have a "hefty" machine with wimpy
viruses than vice versa <grin>.

I have always wondered something about nVIR, though, which someone may
have an explanation for. A few years back - when I first "acquired"
the responsibility for our Mac network here - we had a brief attack of
nVIR on one Mac (yes, only one, amazingly enough). I booted from a
clean, locked System floppy and used ResEdit to clean out the nVIR
resources and correct the CODE resources. I copied rather than cut or
cleared the nVIR resources so I could move them to a separate disk to
examine them later. Immediately an alert popped up saying that it
couldn't write to the System file (disk locked). It seems that simply
by copying the nVIR resources was enough to activate it. Anyone know
if this is possible (copy enabling code execution)? Now remember this
was a couple years ago, so I can't recall everything that occurred,
but I'm still curious as to whether that was enough to get nVIR to try
and spread.

Subject: Format problem (PC)

    I am having a problem formatting disks in my b: drive.  It is a
1.44 M 3.5 floppy, but I am not able to format it to 720K; that is,
when I try to format a double density disk as such : format b:/f:720 ,
it says that the parameters are incompatible.  This worries me because
when I type format b: , the system says Formatting disk at 1.2 M .
Obviously, in the case of a 1.44 M drive, when size is not specified
it should attempt to format to its maximum capacity.  Incidentally, I
am able to format a DD disk at 360K, which makes me think that the
system has my B drive confused with my A drive (1.2 M) - at least on a
command line viewpoint.
       At first I thought I had forgotten how to format ( it's been a
while ) but I looked it up and I was doing it properly according to
DOS 4.01.  Then I had another problem at the same time - I booted up
my computer and it said "ERROR - Run CMOS Setup" - so I did, and
noticed that somehow my hard drive was listed as "not installed".  I
fixed that up no problem, but it made me think tha I had become
infected with a virus.  From there I decided to do a virus scan, using
scanv84.exe - no viruses found.  So I resorted to reinstalling DOS,
and the formatting problem still persists.

  Is there a virus which meets my description?  Or is there some other
possibilty which I am overlooking.  Any suggestions are GREATLY appreci-
ted.
          Thanks ....

  I think not. The reason a PC virus can spread is that it attacks a
feature common to all machines. By having a set of environments the
virus is less likely to come in contact with a viable host.

  In disease terms, if you vaccinate enough people so that an infected
person is unlikely to come in contact with a vulnerable person, the
disease will die. You don't have to protect everyone.

Subject: Form virus (PC)

I discovered something strange the other day when removing the "Form"
virus from 60+ machines in our PC labs.

I was using the McAffe SCAN/CLEAN V84 booting from a clean DOS
diskette.  I manage to remove the virus from all machines except two.
I found out that these two machines had been booted from a infected
diskette. I SCANned the diskette and found a Form virus. The two
machines did not have a Form virus, but Stoned, Stoned II and Stoned
Related virus (that's what SCAN told me) But the strange thing is that
it was active in MEMORY even when I booted the machine from a clean
dos diskette| Stranger than truth..  (Except that it's true..)

So what I did was to infect a clean machine by booting it from a
diskette with a Form virus. Usually, if you boot a machine from a dos
disk, it blinks the hard drive led checking/reading something. This
time I did not manage to boot it, and I removed the diskette (knowing
that the virus had jumped over to the hard drive). I then CLEAN'ed the
hard drive booting from a clean dos diskette, but this didn't work.
CLEAN stopped with a fatal message, namely that three versions of the
Stoned virus was present in memory.

Phew. So what I was wondering was does the Form virus "unpack" itself
to a Stoned look-a-like virus in some cases ?

Subject: SF virus - "When Harlie Was One"

    I don't recall where I found this information, but the book by
David Gerrold, was based on combining and expanding his short stories.
Only a subplot in the book dealt with a scheme where a program called
VIRUS was created which randomly dialed the phone til it found a
computer, then break in and infect it with a copy of VIRUS, slowing
the computer down until it was unusable.  The inventor had plans to
market a program called VACCINE, to cure the virus.  The problem was
that VIRUS mutated during transmission due to phone line noise and
VACCINE was no longer effective.
    Interestingly, only the 1st edition (Ballentine Books, 1972) had
this subplot.

A friend of mine has got virus, PROBABLY from garbo.uwasa.fi; inside
the program HYDK421.ZIP.

Please, May anybody from garbo check if this program is infected ?

Characteristics of this virus:

- - It's not detected by McAfee's SCAN82 and CLEAN82.
  It's only possible to detect when a write protection TSR program
  is active, like TSAFE from TNTVIRUS (Carmel).
  This antivirus informs of Brain/Ashar virus.

- - It infects hard drive: boot, partition table and FAT.
  The virus is installed in the FAT, it's impossible to edit the part
  of the FAT where the virus is stored.

- - It intercepts hard drive write interruption.

- - It infects the EXE programs without changing their size.

- - The virus is loaded into memory although the computer is booted with
  a clean floppy. This is the reason for supposing that it's in the
  partition table.

- - After the low-level format of the hard drive ( with FXPREP ), the virus
  continues in the hard drive.

The computer is a 386/25 with two hard drives (40 and 120 Mb), and DOS 5.0.
  ( the two hard drives are infected )


Suggestions will be welcome.


Thanks in advance.

Pardon me while I clarify my use of terms. I said "worm" instead of
"virus" assuming that a virus spreads infection via shared storage
media and a worm spreads via network connections.  Clearly, there are
cases that combine both (ie spreading via network-mounted media like
Appleshare or TOPS).

As I recall, P1 would enter a computer over a phone connection, infect
the operating system, and then propagate itself via phone connections
to other computers. The author had some stuff about P1 "learning" how
to infect an operating system once it was inside, but infection
clearly spread in a worm-like manner. I think the author added the
stuff about "AI" because he didn't know how feasible such an infection
might become. This follows the popular fictional device to use the
"AI" label on things that are otherwise hard to explain technically.

I think Mycroft Holmes/Adam Selene represent a different situation.
There was no "taking over" involved, really. Mike was installed as
"the computer in charge" of the local computer complex and there
wasn't any "infection" involved. You could say the system just didn't
operate exactly as the designers intended, (making jokes wasn't part
of the original spec, I suppose). Mike's unusual behavior is more of
an intrinsic "bug" or "feature," sort of like the homicidal behavior
of HAL 9000.

One might be able to make a similar argument about HARLIE. I don't
remember offhand whether he found his way into computers outside his
company. He was clearly authorized to take control of stuff inside the
company and he exploited this to the limit. I remember he surprised
people with the extent of his control, but I don't know whether he
ever really exceeded his authority.

Subject: Anti-Viral Techniques for Networks

	There is one major missing link to the anti-viral
authentication method with most of the current commercial products.
The problem has been mentioned a few times as concerned users have
asked "How do I know that xxxx is working without trying to infect
myself ?" The same question holds true for networks: "How does the
server know that xxxx is working on the client ?"

	The answer is simple, but it is going to be up to the vendors to
impliment it (I have mentioned it to McAfee, Enigma-Logic, and Leprechaun
already simply because I happened to speak to them after thinking of it).
What we need is a simple algorithmic method to verify that the antiviral
product is actually resident, its configuration, and the version number.

	This does not have to be complicated: a simple .COM file
stored on the server and invoked with the login script can interrogate
the system for residency, perform a checksum that will also validate
the version number, (which can return the number as an errorlevel) and
set an environmental variable to reflect the installed configuration
(invoking command line switches would be adequate).

	I use a rudimentary form of this to do similar checking of
DiskSecure from a server so it can be done relatively easily, how
would be up to the vendors> However, I would suggest that this matter be
discussed at the vendors meeting in Washington next month (doubt that
I will be able to go).

	The key here is to tame the network and make it start working
for its own defense rather than the traditional method of relying on
the clients.  Is it a perfect defense ? No, but a whole lot better
than what we have now. It might even be *enough*.

  The catch with hardware is that it costs more money than some people
may be willing to pay. An idea I've been toying with lately has been
to write a dummy partition table which Stoned will recognize as being
itself. This would defer infection. For $5 a shot, do you think
anybody would go for it?

  I just got my hands on a copy of Jerusalem strain B. Perhaps a
similar fix would be possible for this.

As a long time SF fan (fiend) I've been following this discussion with
great interest!  When Shockwave Rider got mentioned re virus (and long
before I subscribed to this network) I went out, found it, and read it
with great interest.  When "When Harlie Was One" was mentioned same-o-same
and enjoyed them both.  Now I need to find The Adolescence of P-1.  I'd
been aware of The Moon is a Harsh Mistress since HS (class of '64) so I
enjoyed Padgett's little piece on it.  No one yet has mentioned what was
probably the most terrifying set of books about computers run amok that
I've ever seen - D. F. Jones - "Colossus", "The Fall of Colossus", and
"Colossus and the Crab."  For those who may've seen the movie based on
the first one, it pales in comparison to the book.  I've been watching
my PC's like a hawk for anomalous behavior!  They _do_ seem to develope
a personality after a while.  I call both of them "Harvey."  Any Jimmy
