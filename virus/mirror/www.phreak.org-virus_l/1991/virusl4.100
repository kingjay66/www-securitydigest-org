VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Ah - this is not correct.  I have contacted the author of the virus,
and got the whole story from him - quite interesting story, in fact.
Anyhow, "Denzuko" is just his nickname.

"MAN CATCHES COMPUTER VIRUS!"
by Michael Todd, special correspondent.

  John Stevens has a lot in common with his home computer:  Both think
logically, both like numbers and both are sick with a virus - the same
virus!
  Stevens, a computer programmer who works out of his home in a
Philadelphia suburb, is convinced his lingering and debilitating illness
is something he got from his sick computer.  And the victims's doctor
agrees.

We were hit with Plastique. Having inspected it, there seemed to be
reason for me to believe that other viruses might use a similar method
to trigger the infection algorithm.

Indeed, McAfee contacted me (good Company, they were concerned). We
had an old SCAN at the time, but sooner or later this scenario will
re-occur, as you will get hit with a similar type of virus that McAfee
has not yet catered for, even if you have their very latest version.
You then end up with your RAM infected, but you are living in
Disneyland (like we did) believing otherwise, and you then proceed to
zap your hard disk.

Sure, theory says that it won't happen. hahaha.

We have a checksumming program as well - the original article to which
I tried to reply asked for comments on such a thing.  The checksumming
program indeed may let you know that you _have_ been infected - big
deal, in my opinion, if any advert lulls you into a sense of security
because you have a checksummer in place. A checksummer gives you no
security whatsoever, because it does not prevent a viral infection.
Not that much else does either, for that matter, but that is not the
point, the advert needs to be taken with a hefty pinch of salt.

Just that our experience that I wished to share was that with a
checksummer in place and use of SCAN, you can end up with every last
EXE/COM file on you hard disk looking very sick indeed.

Subject: Re: Hoffman Summary & FPROT (PC)

Richard Travsky was asking how come Patricia Hoffman's Virus Summaries
keep making reference to only a very old and outdated version of
F-PROT (v1.07), where the current version is v1.15, going for 1.16 and
into v2.0 very soon:

> Any reason why such an old version is used?

My suspicion is that this is probably a result of some antagonism
between Grisk and McAfee, whom Patricia Hoffman follows so closely.
Frisk is a competitor...

One thing that Mr. Doss forgot to mention is that although Central
Point Anti-Virus v1.0 can easily romove the Asuza virus from a floppy,
it cannot remove the virus from a hard drive.  The only way to
disinfect a hard drive is to redo the low level format because the
virus infects the boot sector and the dos partition.  A high level
format will not remove the virus, nor will simply removing the dos
partition with the fdisk program.

Subject: MIBSRV Updates (PC)

By Tuesday, June 11 the file VSUM9105.ZIP and VSUM9105.TXT will be
placed on mibsrv.  Sorry for the delay.  Various other files have also
been updated (thanks for the info, Keith!).  A complete listing will
be sent out tomorrow (June 11).

Other notes: The IBM RT system on which the mibsrv files reside will
be gone by June 28.  The new system administrator for the College of
Eng. has informed me that I will be allowed to transfer all of the
archives from 130.160.20.80 to a new RISC 6000 machine.....however,
the IP address is unknown at this time.

Mibsrv will stay up at least until the 28th of June.  As soon as I
know the IP address of the new machine and get the files transfer
over, I'll let you know.  I have enjoyed keeping mibsrv stocked with
ibm-antiviral files and will try to make the transfer as painless as
possible (famous last words).

Subject: Advice requested (PC)

I am a SW Eng. for a 500 company, and I got volunteered to come up
with some software to check out the PC's in our area.  Is there a
software package that can be LEGALLY swaped between multiple PC
computers, and is not necessarily a resident program.  I have been
looking at Nortan, Central Point, and Virex; however, I would be
interested in a list of a few more programs that are tailored for
multiple PC inspection.

Thanks in advance,
Greg

Yes, you can do that, and there could be other advantages too:
(a) potentially faster execution (if you are doing a whole diskette, you can
    organise things to reduce head movement), and
(b) bypass some viruses, which intercept int 21 or int 13.

There are some limitations, basically involving incompatibility with
some network software, RAM drives, etc, but quite a good idea for most
purposes.  The latest version of my CHECKOUT program uses this;
earlier versions didn't check files - just the boot sector - but used
int 40 instead of int 13 for similar reasons.

Ultimately, anti-virus software is going to directly access the disk
controller (or possibly do far calls to the BIOS), to be certain of
avoiding smart viruses, and relying on DOS will be unthinkable (as it
*should* be now).

This leads me to a thought... suppose a virus-removal program gets rid
of the virus from disk, but the infected sectors still exist in (say)
an Extended memory cache system. Has anyone guarded against this?

A number of viral programs would fit this bill, the most obvious being
the ubiquitous "Stoned".  Check the boot sectors of your boot disks with
your Norton utilities.

How about making the thing political?  If 'certain countries' expect
'other countries' - e.g. (ours) to financially bail them out of up to
74 years of infrastructural mismanagement we could at least demand
that the kill of their virus factories before we open our purses!!

Maybe we should all tell our respectiv governments - the EEC - te
World Bank etc about this ??
