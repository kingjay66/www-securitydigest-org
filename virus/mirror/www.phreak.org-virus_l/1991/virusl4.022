If you did this and the "All is OK" didn't come up you could well
suspect a boot sector infection, but I'm afraid this isn't a good
diagnostic.  Many boot sector infectors make a copy of the original
boot sector and store it somewhere "safe" on the infected disk/ette.
What happens at boot-up is that the virus code is loaded *as if* it
were a "proper" boot sector (the BIOS program that does this is very
"dumb" as regards the contents of the boot sector).  The viral code is
then executed as the boot sector code would be and it does whatever
(with STONED, for example, it installs itself at the top of memory and
reduces the ammount of available memory, looks for an uninfected hard
disk to infect and so on).  The virus then loads the original boot
sector from its hiding place and passes control to the boot sector
code.  The machine then continues to boot "as normal".

If a virus such as STONED infected a machine with a cherry "All is OK"
message in the boot sector, you would continue to see this now
terribly misleading message after the STONED code loaded and passed
control to the original boot sector.

If the "All is OK" boot sector did a check of the actual (physical)
boot sector then it wouldn't give an erroneous message if the disk was
infected with STONED or similar boot sector infectors, but it would
still give a misleading report if a stealth boot sector infector
struck, as the virus would intercept the attempt to read the boot
sector and return the contents of the original from its hiding place.
(This seems to be a lot of extra code to jam into a single sector, so
to do this an "All is OK" boot program may have to deal with loading
in extra sectors of code, etc remembering that you don't yet have
access to the DOS file handling calls to readily locate that code.)

I am new to this group but I would associate Eddie and "Crazy Eddie"
with "The Mote in God's Eye" -I forget the author's name- But to go
"Crazy Eddie" was to discard the accepted meme's and conventions of
society and do something out of racial character.  As I think more
about it, I think the Author was Niven/Pournell.  Seems to me those
who write viri are "Crazy Eddie"

Subject: Stoned in Three Hills (PC)

The following messages are crossposted from the SUZY network, in the
Religion/INspiration section.  The original infection was at a Bible
school in Three Hills, Alberta, which managed to get the "Stoned" virus
onto a network of computers in teh Library.  The response of the school
was to ship all the computers to Calgary to be reformatted.  All data
entered on the system to that point had to be re-entered manually ...

  Subject: Nobody is safe

  The January 8th issue of ChristianWeek carries a news item from
  Wesern Report that Prairie Bible Institute in Three Hills,
  Alberta, was hit by the "Stoned" virus this winter.  I find this
  story doubly frustrating: not only is it added evidence that
  churches and other Christian organizations need to pay more
  attention to issues of computer security (see INtegrity for the
  tools you need), it is a glaring example of the failure of
  Christians to communicate with one another.  I have been trying
  for 3 years now to give Christian computer users they need to do
  their tasks effectively through various channels (Christian Info,
  CAMsoc, Church Bytes, CITC_NET, and Suzy), including warnings
  about computer viri, yet despite my best efforts, an institution
  which I visited *last Spring* gets hit by a virus, and spends way
  too much time and money dealing with it.  When are we
  Christians going to learn to network?

Hi Greg:
        I regret to inform you that I will be pulling the plug on
Prairie BBS as of Jan.31/91.  I hope its not too late to cancel my
listing in the article you were preparing.  One of the key reasons for
going down is lack of usership.  Although Three Hills is a small town by
city standards it probably has as high a computer user ratio per capita
as anywhere due to the college. A significant number of those do not
have modems but a good number do have modems.  However not enough were
interested in the messaging capabilities of the computer medium.  On an
average week I saw maybe 4 or 5 users.  A busy week might bring 8 or 10.
Yes, that's per week!!!  No messages were ever sent out (other than my
own) and the main interest among those who did use the BBS clearly was
downloading files.  When my video card fried itself recently, which I
believe was due to the wear and tear of continuous running (heat
mainly), I decided it wasn't worth the expense.

        I noted with some chuckles your note in the missions echo re:
the stone virus at Prairie.  I have modemed for 5 years and never caught
a virus until I gave a disk to the computer department to format and on
which to store some student scan tron scores.  They passed the virus
along to me on that disk but I didn't use it right away and so when I
heard there was a possible virus I ran McAfee's SCAN checker on the disk
and it picked it up instantly and told me exactly what variety virus it
was.  When I suggested, after the incident, that they need a security
system and in addition to virus checkers they should limit user access
to some terminals I was told by one individual: "We can't stop trusting
people." To their credit they now have purchased some virus checking
programmes but I am not so sure they have implemented any further
precautions re: users to their terminals. All of this is part and parcel
of the frustration I have struggled with of getting people interested in
the computer/modem communication medium.  If people took the time to
avail themselves of what is so easily available to us we likely would
not, as you pointed out, have borne the expense of this incident.  The
sad part, from my perspective, is that I cannot say for sure that the
lesson has yet been learned.

	This is not surprising if the disks are similar and would
depend on the disk configuration and "bad tracks". Very simply, it is
not unusual a hard disk to have a few "bad tracks" reported. This
usually appears on a sheet supplied with the drive and on a label
attached to the drive. At one time, most drives I saw had zero while
today 2-4 is not unusual. If a 40 Mb drive had over 5 I would become
concerned though I once saw a 33 Mb EDSI drive with over 100
(really!).

	Normally, the label will report "bad" tracks by cyl and head
e.g. cyl 307 hd 5 and this should be entered into the "defects list"
when a low-level format is done such as by DISKMANAGER.

	Now on an MFM drive, there are typically 17 sectors per
cyl/head so when a "track" is marked bad, this represents 17 x 512
bytes or 8704 bytes.  However, when the disk is formatted, DOS
allocates in "clusters" made up of 2, 4, 8, or 16 sectors. Since if
any part of a cluster touches the bad track, DOS marks it "bad" in the
FAT so the real loss depends on the cluster size (Norton's DiskInfo or
any of a number of utilities can give you this information) so for
each bad track, DOS reports "bad sectors" as follows:

Cluster Size     Sectors Lost "Bad"     DOS Lost Bytes/"Bad" Track
     2                 18                    9,216
     4                 20                   10,240
     8                 24                   12,288
    16                 32                   16,384

Thus for 4 sectors / cluster, each "track" marked bad will have CHKDSK
report a loss of 10,240 bytes, if four heads are reported on the "bad
track" list, CHKDSK will report a loss of 40,960 bytes. This would not
be unusual and could be verified by examination of the disk or use of
a non-destructive disk analysis utility such as Steve Gibson's
SPINRITE. What would be unusual would be the loss of a different
sector quanta such as 2 - 4 sector clusters or 4096 bytes.

Note: If you use DEBUG to look at the boot sector (-L 100 2 0 1), the
      cluster size may be found at offset 0Dh (debug command -e10d). If you
      see a 10, remember this is hex (16).

Not true! - We've had an Invader infection here on DIKU (Dept. of

	I must disagree though the boot sector is a difficult place to
put it and all sorts of housekeeping would be required. The partition
table on the other hand is a nice place. The "stealth" viruses (JOSHI
et al) operate by redirecting low-level interrupts to return only
uninfected code.  To do so, they must go resident in RAM. Once the OS
loads, this is very difficult to detect since each OS does its own
redirection. Prior to the OS load however, only the bare BIOS or ROM
extension interrupts are available and these can be verified very
easily and are sufficient to detect such attacks immediately.

Altough I received two mail messages saying that it was because of the
self checker in wp, I would say Mr. Skulason is right. I also heard of
viri infecting wp, Jerusalem and PingPong. Isn't it easy to build a
self-checker into a program ( as suggested WP has done )? I could
imagine that you just check the .exe when it is running, you could
play around with some XOR's to create a check. You could even put the
value in a seperate file, as long as your checking algorithm is
complexe enough.

Hi,

   We know that signature based scanner will not search into compressed
EXE/COM file. So if we have decompressors we should decompress the file
and then apply virus scanner on it.

   The following is a list of EXE/COM compressors I heard of:
   compressor:                    decompressor:
      LZEXE                         UNLZEXE

      Shrink
      SCRNCH
      ICE                           ICE breaker
      CRUNCH

   I'd like to hear from you of other compressors and decompressors.

   And one more thing: how are device drivers loaded? Can they be
compressed also? If yes, how can we decompress that?

   Many thanks.

P.S.: I just heard of there is ICE breaker. But never seen that.

I have a book on assembly language programming of the PC video

to avoid when setting up the video controller.

It claims that you can actually physically damage a monitor from
within software.  Needless to say I haven't tried it to see if it's
really true.

I don't know about other components.

Subject: Easy way to write protect 3.5" disks

I've seen several references to prying out the write protect
tabs of a 3.5" disk to render it permanently read-only.

This is a lot of work, especially as some disks are not real
well heat-sealed;  the entire case has a tendency to split
(while the write tab stays stubbornly in place).  Any
kind of styrene cement will work just fine for gluing
them in the "open" position.

Personally, I like Testor's tube cement;  this is basically a
version of the liquid stuff with a lot of plastic already
dissolved into it, so that (1) it flows slower, (2) it acts
less rapidly, and (3) it doesn't kick as much junk into the
air when it is setting.  The smell might put some people
off (I stick 'em shut in my office, then leave them to dry
while I'm elsewhere);  if you've ever built models you probably
won't mind it.

By the way, if you do want to remove the tab permanently, just
use a generous amount of the liquid version:  this will dissolve
the entire corner of the disk case and the tab may easily be
removed.  I know this works from (unintentional) experiment :).
