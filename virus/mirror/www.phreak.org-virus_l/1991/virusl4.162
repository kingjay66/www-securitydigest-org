Multiple infections are quite well known (a year ago Stoned & Joshi
were popular) and quite operative given exculusive signatures and
locations.

What happens is that virus A infects a disk moving the real MBR to
sector A' and its code into sectors A''-A'''. Virus B then infects
moving the MBR with A to sector B' and its code to B''-B'''. Virus C
then infects moving the MBR with B to C' and its code into C''-C'''.
If all of these sectors (A'-A''', B'-B''', and C'-C''' are different
the machine may work after a fashion.

If you consider a 640k PC and each virus is 2k long when resident
(Ping-Pong and Typo are 2k and Stoned is 1k according to my notes),
a boot process will go like this:

The BIOS executes POST and transfers control to the MBR (virus C)
C executes, grabs INT 13, kicks down available memory by 2k  and
goes resident @ segment 9F80. It then loads and transfers control
to virus B. B grabs INT 13, kicks down available memory by 2k  and
goes resident @ segment 9F00. It then loads and transfers control
to virus A. A grabs INT 13, kicks down available memory by 2k  and
goes resident @ segment 9E80. It then loads and transfers control
to the real MBR.

A floppy is inserted in drive A and accessed. Virus A (last loaded and
first on the INT 13 chain moves the Boot Record, infects the floppy and
chains to virus B. B moves virus A, infects the floppy and
chains to virus C. C moves virus B, infects the floppy and
chains to the real Int 13.

A virus detector (assuming no stealth is involved) then does a memory
SCAN and should report all three viruses in memory. Booting clean,
a SCAN is done on the floppy and detects only virus C since most anti-
virus products scan only the boot sectors for BSIs. A & B are on the
disk, just elsewhere.

If a viral remover is in use, it may just remove C and restore B if it
copies the floppy boot record from where C put it. A would then be still
connected via B. If, on the other hand, the virus remover replaces the boot
record, A & B may be disconnected. On a floppy it is better to copy the disk
(being careful not to reboot) and reformat it.

The danger is in assuming that since the detector only reported a single
virus on the floppy, that only one is present. This may not be true.

In the case given, the fact that the STONED was reported only indicates
that it was the last to infect the floppy (C), not that it was the only
infection.

Of course the scenario given is unlikely since the chance of encountering
three mutually exclusive infections in the proper order is remote. I would
suspect a specially doctored floppy created by someone with access to a number
of viruses as the most likely vector in this case.

Subject: Previously unknown version of Friday 13th found in Finland (PC)

A virus not known to the most popular virus scanners (F-PROT, SCAN and
VIRSCAN) has been found in Helsinki, Finland. The virus infects only
COM-files appending 440 bytes to the end of each file.

The virus is apparently closely related to the "South African" family
of viruses. It activates on any Friday the 13th, when it outputs an
omega sign (ascii 234) on the screen and wipes out the partition
tables of all hard drives it can find.

The virus has been named "Omega". A suitable hex string for finding it
is (in F-PROT 2.0 format)

Depends on your point of view. As a user, you could probably care less
- - all that is necessary is to know that *something* has happened. But
for the tech who comes out in response to the bleat for help, more is
necessary.  If it is me, I try to collect all information possible
before proceeding & then, veeerrry cautiously until I know exactly
what we are dealing with since my purpose is to recover the machine,
not scramble it hopelessly, and hopefully without a FORMAT.

For automatic anti-viral removal software, "precise identification" is
essential since vital information is often tucked away at specific
offsets in the code. Information such as where the "real" Boot Record
was stashed (for some months recovery from the Music Bug was declared
impossible without format since the location of the boot parameter
block was altered). Sunday-A and Sunday-B are very closely related
except that the offset where the first ten bytes of the original
program is stored is different.

Consequently, while the user may be disinterested, to the tech,
precise knowlege of the infection greatly speeds up recovery. Besides
I always feel much better once I have determined exactly what we are
dealing with.  Surprises are usually unpleasant.

Hello there:

Recently I have got a very server virus problems on my PS II and PC.
I found most of the executable files, with .COM and .EXE extensions,
are infected by Yankee Doodle.  I am wondering if there is some
programs which fix the infected executable files.  Could someone out
there kindly direct me where to find the programs (if they are
available through anonymous ftp) or which compony has such programs.

Thanks in advance.

Joe,

I am a student manager for the Academic Computing Center at Wheaton
College, where all we use in our lab are Macintosh Classics and LC's.

It has been my experience that, for as long as I have worked here,
that administrations of colleges try to keep the subject of viruses
low-key. They don't want to worry the students, and they don't want to
admit they have a problem.

In addition, up until this past summer, our computing center used
Virex on our machines, and didn't tell any students who bought
computers about any type of virus protection. Fortunately, this
summer, they switched to Disinfectant.

The user group on campus (of which I am also a member) is trying to
educate more students about Disinfectant and viruses, but it is tough.
We can't get a listing of students who have purchased Macs, so we have
to try and catch them as they leave...not an easy task.

I think the response to the viruses is paranoid. Their way of thinking
must be along the lines of "if we tell them, they might try to write
their own viruses."

Yes, Disinfectant is free...but on a college campus, where things like
viruses are spoken of, it's difficult to get the word around.

The opinions stated in this letter are my own, and do not in any way,
reflect the opinions, thoughts, or feelings of my administration.
Anything I say is my own fault! :)

Looking for SUN/OS compatible Virus checker program

Like many LANs , Ours Files servers are UNIX based but also support
the MS-DOS community. I am looking for a SUN/OS binary or coding which
can be ran by the CRONTAB automaticly at set times.

It will only need to scan the MS-DOS file sectio sections or sections
requested.

Anybody have any ideas?
Anybody working on such a program?

It's been re-thought for the new release.  V82 (released this AM)
should fix any problems removing the KeyPress.

Hello Mr. Ellard,

It sounds like you are removing the virus from your father's hard
disk, but are eventually reinfecting yourself by booting off of
infected floppies.  ANY floppy (including data) inserted into the
machine during the infection and referenced by the system will have
the virus on it.  You will need to go through all of your floppies,
bootable or otherwise, and check them for the virus, and remove if
found.

VIRSTOP.BIN is needed if you want to customised VIRSTOP.EXE program.
You can customised it such that it will print whom to call within your
organisation (or any other message) if it detect a virus. This is
selectable from the main menu.

Subject: Michelangelo virus info (PC)

Name:                  Michelangelo virus
Aliases:               none sofar!
Family:                Stoned virus
First occurence:       summer 1991
Place:                 n/a
Type:                  bootsektor / partitiontable virus
Length:                fits well into the code space of the partitiontable
Operating system:      not of interest, just uses BIOS interrupts
Version:               any
Computer:              PCs and up
Direct detection:      The original partition table or the original boot sector
                       can be found in sector 7 with hard disks, sector 3 with
                       12 bit FAT media, and sector 14 with 16 bit FAT media.
Type of infection:     Upon boot up from an infected floppy the virus will go
                       memory resident and infect the partition table. Any
                       INT13 is intercepted thereafter. Any floppy A: operation
                       will infect the disk in drive A: provided the motor
                       was off. (This cuts excessive infection testing)
Infection trigger:     Bootup from an infected disk will infect a computer.
                       Usage of the floppy A: drive (read, write, or format)
                       can cause an infection of that medium.
Infection targets:     Partition table with harddisks and bootsectors with
                       floppy disks.
Interrupts:            INT 13 and INT 1A
Payload:               Data destruction by overwriting the medium, from which
                       the computer was booted from. (with harddisks it will
                       overwrite sector 1..17 on head 0..3 of all tracks, with
                       floppies sector 1..9 or 1..14 on both heads and all
                       tracks depending on FAT type)
Payload trigger:       Date equal 6th of Mach of any year, which is
                       Michelangelo's birthday.
Families:              The virus seems to be an enhanced Stoned virus.
Removal:               Boot up from a clean disk and move the original sector
                       to its proper location (sector 1 head 0 track 0)
                       on some systems FAT copy 1 might be damaged, so an
                       additional copying of FAT 2 onto FAT 1 might be
                       necessary.

Yes, it is, although it hasn's been implemented yet (to my knowledge,
of course). It is possible for a boot/partition table infector to
store its body in the first copy of the FAT, instead of allocating bad
clusters.

If it overwrites only the first FAT copy, you won't lose anything...
and you probably won't even notice that something nasty has happened.

> What is the repair procedure to fix the FAT if an infection occurs?

Boot from a known non-infected, write-protected system diskette and
run a non-infected copy of Norton Disk Doctor (part of the Norton
Utilities package) - also from a write-protected diskette. It is able
to repair such problem as unequal FAT copies.

Note however, that it won't help if a virus has been especially
designed to hide in the first FAT copy - you'll need probably a
specific disinfector.

Hope the above helps.
