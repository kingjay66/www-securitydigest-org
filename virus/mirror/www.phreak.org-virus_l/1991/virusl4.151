Do it yourself hard disk locking is possible, if you have an MFM or
RLL drive (don't know enough about IDE, but I suspect it is
impossible).

Simply pull the write gate line via a resistor to either +5 or ground
(sorry, I've forgotten if it is active high or low).  The resistor
should be round 200 ohms or so (not very critical).  I do it on the
cntroller card, because access is easier, and take it via a 3.5 mm
normally closed socket that I mount in a hole on the card support.
That way, when you want to make the drive writable, you just plug a
3.5 mm audio plug into it.

Some (possibly many) hard disk controllers test the hard disk by
accessing it on power up, and they won't allow this scheme.  I've had
good results with the Taiwanese LCS-6210D cards.

Hi there!
I have this problem:
I need to find an updated (let's say one month old is updated) list
of viruses, for both IBM-PC and Macintosh machines.
If somebody can please tell me where i can find it i will
really appreciate it. I do have ftp access. I am not subscribed to this
list, so please answer me via e-mail. If you want, you may write
asking me for summaries, and i may mail them (or send them to the list if
the ammount of requests is big enough).
Thanks a lot for your help!

Sorry - but it doesn't.  This is exactly the sort of mis-information
that members of this forum shouldn't be spreading.  If you are going
to "tell it like it is" please get it right.

This reply is not directed personally to Alan - he just happened to be
the latest purveyor of this very commonly held misbelief.

>From my experience, in anXT or AT with a four floppy controller the
first four drive letters (A-D) will all represent floppy drives.  Any
HD's/partitions will come _after_ this.

Further, only _some_ machines follow the naming scheme laid out for
HD's.  Most I've seen do, but the one I'm currently writing from has C:
as the first partition on first physical HD (it only has 2 floppies), D:
as first partition on second HD, E: as second partition on first, and F:
as second partition on second.  (In case you are wondering, this is not
done with a bunch of SUBSTS/ASSIGNS/whatever.  Machine is 386, AMI BIOS,
DOS 4.01 (unfortunately), 1st HD has primary bootable DOS partition (30
Meg) and 10 Meg second partition (hangover from DOS 3.3?).  Second HD is
60 Meg with primary partition of 1 track (approx 64K all up?) and an
extended partition of the rest.  (I did _not_ set this up - I inherited
it and am too busy to reconfigure things - which I will when I get my
DOS 5 upgrade.)

I suspect that Alan got his info (directly or indirectly) from that
great source of knowledge an light about PC's - The DOS Technical
Reference.  Unfortunately, many programmers believe what they read in
this mighty work, resulting in programs that we can't easily install
(and sometimes never even run) on the main PC our Operations staff use,
because C: is hard-coded into their prog, because it is designed for
bootable HD's only.

Most PC "gurus" seem to "know" that the first HD _must always_ be C:
- - believe me, _IT BLODDY WELL IS'NT TRUE_.

Thanks for reading, sorry for shouting, but this one really p***es me
off.

I borrowed Norton Anti Virus from a friend to check up my system. The
first thing I did, however, was to run the program on the diskette I
borrowed it on. First I used McAFee's SCAN.EXE. Nothing nasty showed
up. Then I asked NAV to scan itself. NAV told me that "NAV.EXE is
infected with an unknown strain."

And what may I ask does that mean?

I fail to understand why the author of this program believes that
anyone might find it of any use whatsoever.

Saying that something is "infected with virus signatures" is
meaningless nonsense.  A program is either infected with a virus or it
is not - creating a file which contains bits and pieces from a virus
does not make it virus infected.

To start with, there is no such thing as a "safe virus" - the Virus
Simulator does not create viruses - therefore there is no reason why
an anti-virus program should report any of the files it creates to be
infected.  In fact, all reports of viruses in the virus-simulator
files should be considered to be false alarms, as the files are not
infected at all.

So what ?

The programs are not viruses, and there is no reason why they should be
reported as such. Even if a virus scanner happens by chance to use a
signature contained in one of the virus fragments, and might therefore
report the file as infected, this is of no interest at all.

Bullsh*t!

The files created by the Virus Simulator may cause some virus scanners
to trigger in some cases, but a perfect virus detector should be able
to determine that the files are not viruses, and should not trigger at
all.

This statement is highly misleading.  If the author of an anti-virus
program has not supplied the author of the Virus Simulator with his
signatures, there is no guarantee that the scanner will detect the
simulated viruses.

Also, if the scanner requires the signature to be located at a specific
offset, or uses an algorithmic approach to detect some viruses, it will
probably not detect anything in the "simulated" files.

Huh ?  "Established security procedures" ?  The only thing the Virus
simulator is able to test is if virus scanners which use publically
available signatures, which are included in the Virus Simulator will
indeed detect the viruses they claim to detect.  As a general tool for
testing and comparing virus scanners it is totally useless.

I only hope that the author of the program realizes soon how useless
it is...

Great idea to publish this on the net. You can be sure that such

Subject: Experiment with virus

I have a Ms-Dos 386 with Dos 3.30 and 80 Mb HD, 3 partitions.  I want
to do some experiment of controlled propagation of viruses (on
floppies, of course) whithout risks for my HD.

Which of the follow is the security level that I should use?

1 ) Unplug the power cable of HD. (what about the controller ?)

2 ) Set the CMos data to no Hard Disk

3 ) Write in the partion table that every partition is write protected.

Thanks a lot for your suggest.

Subject: The Tenbytes virus mutates! (PC)

Hello, everybody!

It seems that nobody has noticed that the Tenbytes virus, which has
been posted accidentally on Valert some time ago (two years? one
year?) is able to mutate.

The virus itself is not encrypted, that's why all virus scanners are
able to detect all its mutations. However, programs that try to
disinfect the infected files and therefore have to check them very
carefully, are very confused to discover that the scan string of the
virus is present, but not where it is expected.

What the virus does? First of all, it only mutates when it infects EXE
files. All infected COM files look in the same way, and the
disinfectors have no problem to remove the virus from them. However,
when the virus infects an EXE file, it changes its entry point to
point to on of three (if I'm not wrong) different places in the virus
body. The selection is random. The two good disinfectors that I've
tried - Dr. Solomon's Anti-virus Toolkit 5.13 and F-Prot 1.16 both
were unable to disinfect all infected EXE files. They claimed that
this is a new variant of the virus, which obviously was not the case,
since I infected them from a COM file, which was recognized as
infected exactly by the Tenbytes virus. I haven't tried CLEAN v80 yet.

Can anybody who has experience with this virus (Dave? Frisk?) to
confirm these results?

Regards,
Vesselin

Subject: When is it active?

FUNGEN5.CVP   910828

                        Viral activation

In attempting to protect against viral infection, and
particularly when trying to disinfect systems, it is important to
bear in mind the times that the virus is actively "infectious".
The viral activation is not the same as the activation of the
payload that a virus may carry.  For example, the payload of the
original "Stoned" virus was a message which appeared on the
screen saying "Your PC is now Stoned!".  This message only
appears at boot time, and on only one eighth of the times the
computer is rebooted.  The virus, however, is infectious at all
times, if it has infected the hard disk.

There are basically three possibilities for the infectious
period: now ("one-shot"), during program run ("while called") or
from now on (resident).  These periods may be modified by other
circumstances.  A resident virus may remain in memory, but only
be actively infecting when a disk is accessed.  A "while called"
virus may only infect a new program when a directory is changed.

"One-shot" viri only get one chance on each "run" of the infected
program.  The viral code will seek out and infect a target
program.  They then pass control to the original program, and
perform no further functions.  These are, of course, the simplest
of the viral programs.  Mainframe "mail" viri are generally of
this type.

The second class will activate when the infected program is
called, and then pass partial control to the original program.
The virus, however, will remain operational during the time that
the infected program is running.  If this can be accomplished, it
is only a slight jump to write a fully memory resident virus.

Resident viri are the most successful, and the most dangerous, of
viral programs.  A resident virus will become active when an
infected program is run (or at boot time for boot sector
infectors), and remain active until the computer is rebooted or
turned off.  (Some viral programs are even able to trap the
rebooting sequence that is normally called when you press Ctrl-
Alt-Del on an MS-DOS PC, and thus are able to survive a "warm
boot.")  The most successful of the file infectors, the Jerusalem
virus, is resident, as are all boot sector infectors.  (For
fairly obvious reasons; the boot sector is never "called" in
normal operation.)

If a virus is active in memory, it is a waste of time trying to
disinfect a file or disk.  No sooner is the file "cleaned", than
it becomes a suitable target for re-infection.  You may try to
disinfect a hard disk right down to performing a low level
format: as soon as the disk is reformatted it may be infected all
over again.  This is why all directions for disinfection stress
the necessity of "cold" booting from a disk that is known to be
free of infection before attempting any cleanup.
