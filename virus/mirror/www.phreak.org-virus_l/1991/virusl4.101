VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: Infected networks (PC)

Last week I had occasion to disinfect another large network with the
Jerusalem (not ours - an outside company). The traditional respons is
to take down the net, clean the server, and check all of the clients
before reconnection.  On reflection, this seemed inordinately
inefficient so I came up with a new methodology which I offer for
comment. Note: this works for Jerusalem, Sunday, and non-stealth
infections which infect an executable before allowing it to run -
please be aware of this limitation up front.

The method was as follows:
a) take down net & clean server
b) remove non-essential applications
c) replace essential applications with a batch file that
   1) copies a clean selfcheck program from a writelocked directory
   2) runs the self check program
   3) runs the requested application

In this case I had such a self-check program (1400 bytes) that just
checks its own length & checksum. If it passes, the program exits, if
it fails, the client machine displays a warning message and is locked
up. In this manner, the server application files are protected from
infection (are never called by an infected client). Each client gets a
new copy of the "goat" file so clean clients are not affected, and
infected clients are identified.

Admittedly, this is a special case and directed to a small number of
viruses, but they seem to be the most common.

Comments ?

A number of viral programs would fit this bill, the most obvious being
the ubiquitous "Stoned".  Check the boot sectors of your boot disks with

OUCH! I've had many reports that this is the best way to scramble the

_*IF*_ this is the case, then I would hate to see things take such a
turn as "manipulating" the summary so as to make one package or
another look good or bad.  Once it is done to one package, what is to
stop it form happening to another?  And another?  Will any package
that offends be "punished" by making reference to old and less capable
versions?  (Or "punished" in some other manner?)

The summary is an informative and valuable compilation of virus data.
We users can only lose by seeing it prejudiced by mere commercial
concerns.  Must I be reduced to viewing the summary with a grain of
salt?

Subject: Is This A Virus? (PC)

Recently our department has had some problems with all of the files in
the root directory being erased (even the hidden system files).  This
happened about a week ago to one of our PCs and to two of our PCs
today!  I used the files that come with F-PROT that is site licensed
here and could not find anything (F-PROT version 1.13).  Is this a
virus?  I would appreciate any suggestions.  Help!

I'm not John Norstadt, but I have seen the INIT function when I tried
to run an infected program.  It displayed a dialog box stating that
the application was infected and that I should run Disinfectant to get
rid of the virus.  The application never was started and it went back
to the Finder.

I have not experienced these problems.  The only virus protection/eradication
we use in our student labs is Disinfectant 2.4 (and INIT) and Gatekeeper Aid
1.1.  Gatekeeper Aid automatically removes WDEF A.

I have had no problems with Disinfectant and Gatekeeper Aid, and see no
reason to go through the expense of SAM with all of this good, FREE stuff.

Yes, it's the most current version.

You should examine the boot sector and see what else you can find.  My
symptoms were that I couldn't boot from the hard disk, and I found
that I had been hit with Joshi and Stoned at the same time, and
neither clean77 nor f-disinf (1.15) fixed it, though they both claimed
that they had.  (Immediately rerunning the respective program told me
I was cured again.)

I wound up doing a low level format, since I wasn't able to find a
clean copy of the boot sector stashed away by either of them, and
wasn't sure of what I was doing anyway.

General question: Is there some way of rewriting the boot record
without doing a low level format, or using a disk editor or debugger?
For that matter, what does one use to do a low level format?  Real
IBMs don't come with low level formatting software.

Recently discovered the CCCP virus on one of my disks on 4 files. I am
unfamiliar with this virus but was able to detect and (I hope)
eradicate it by deleting the infected files and re-installing them off
my WB disk. Can some virus wizard tell me about this virus and what it
does? How bad is it?

Also had Smily Cancer Virus a while back and thanks to advice found
here, used MVK to get rid of that. Are there any other Virus

Subject: Boot sector viruses on IDE drives

It recently occurred to me that we get rid of most boot-sector viruses
by routinely doing a low-level format on a drive.  However, this is
not possible on an IDE drive.  So the question becomes; for an IDE
drive, what DO you do to get rid of a boot sector virus?  And yes, I
am constantly telling the users that I support that they really should
be scanning everything first; even before doing a directory, and all
the other prudent precautionary steps, so hopefully we won't have a
problem, but you know how that works.

 To take a page out of the computer underground, wouldn't it be more
 productive to incorporate these ' virus factories ' as part of
 the research into computer viruses.  It could become both a source of
 income for nations like Bulgaria and a source of employment for bored

I tested McAfee's SCAN77 using Rosenthal Engineering's new release of
Virus Simulator (I've seen posted as VIRSIM11.COM on EXEC-PC,
Compuserve and others).  It seems that SCAN77 misses three boot sector
viruses that SCAN76 found on the same disk.  Both versions of SCAN
found nine viruses in the .COM, four in the .EXE and seven in the test
memory virus.

THESCAN, F-FCHK and VIRX also found the test viruses, but Norton's
Anti Virus couldn't find anything.

There's been a number of postings about scanner producers bragging
that their scanners search for more viruses than the next guys.  Well,
it's not how many viruses your scanner looks for that counts.... It's
how many you can find!

Acer America in joint venture with Smith Corona has recently marketed
a small 286 PC that has a ROM cartridge that is used as a ROM disk.
SCC sells it as a PWP-100 (Personal Word Processor) and the software
looks alot like their earlier WP machines.  This is the first in a
product line that has MS-DOS on ROM cartridge.  Not all of DOS, just
enough to boot. (IO.SYS, MSDOS.SYS, COMMAND.COM, AUTOEXEC.BAT,
CONFIG.SYS, and maybe SHARE.EXE, HIMEM.SYS, ANSI.SYS, ..., and the WP
software)

Acer's method doesn't use up RAM addresses, since the ROM card is seen
as a read-only hard disk.  The ROM card itself does use some IOcard
address space since it is considered an expansion card by the
hardware.

I would suggest a slight reordering of your disinfection procedure.

     1) Boot from a known, clean, write protected system floppy disk.
     2) Then run CLEAN/FPROT/whatever to remove the infection.
     3) Test your system again, and redo if necessary.
     4)  Reboot.
