billj@uop.uop.edu says in V3 #67:

This tells you that f-driver is functioning as it should be.  The
USAGE.TXT doc file under F-DRIVER says that when f-test is run is
check whether f-driver is working, it will be stopped just as any
other virus would (NOTE: F-TEST itself is NOT A VIRUS!!).  This
message is what you would see if you ran a program that was actually
infected with anything that F-prot knows about.

	Allow me to comment further on this subject.  You would be
mistaken to think that I did not have to deal with viruses..... I can
remember several incidents of major virus infection.  One machine
actually had 99% of its applications infected ( and it's 200Mb )
	But what we have implemented at our school seems to be
effective at stopping the spread of viri.  I believe all of them have
Virex init installed.  While that may not be able to stop everything
that comes along, you certainly would not have to scan your machine
daily ( personally, I consider that a terrible waste of manpower, use
programs to fight programs.... don't use people.!)

Using HC 2.0v2, in an empty stack, put the "set catcher" into the
stack script, then make a button with:

	on mouseUp
	  put script of this stack into s
	  put return & "--" && the date && the time after s

	  set script of this stack to s

	  put return & "-- Sorry, Mikey." after s

	  send "set script of this stack to s" to HyperCard

	  answer script of this stack -- just to see it

The real problem is that MS-DOS, like the Mac OS, has NO integrity
checking and that viruses are remarkably easy to write. It would be
easy to legislate viruses out of existance except that it is difficult
to arrest a virus. Laws are only effective as a remedy after the fact,
most people are more concerned with not being infected in the firstc
place.

This is the only effective procedure. If it places too heavy a burden
on the users than it is up to technology to determine an acceptable
solution. As in many areas of social intercourse, nothing is no longer
acceptable.

>From one standpoint, we have been very lucky to have been stuck by so
many inept and essentially benign viruses over the last few years.
This has given up an effective learning period where ignorance was
both the norm and curable.  Today, things are quite different. The
writers of viruses have been learning at the same time we have and
Windows/DOS 5 provide more opportunities for intrusion (actually many
of these "holes" have existed since DOS 3.0 in 1984, jut had not been
exploited).

To those who have been paying attention, it should be obvious that
protection layered on to of DOS is no longer sufficient, integrity
management must (and can easily) start at the BIOS level. The fact
that so many current viruses do so (Stoned, Joshi, MusicBug, Empire,
etc) should be evidence enough.

Some versions of VIRUSCIDE (Parsons Technology) contain the "12
Tricks" signature string & will cause this indication from a number of
other anti-viral programs.

Subject: Boot Sector virus from CSSR@hippo.ru.ac.za (South Africa) (PC)

Just received a copy of the boot sector virus and it is a hacked
STONED that has just had the message changed (at least that is what FC
says) As in the STONED the message has two parts, one that is
displayed, and one that is not. The displayed message:

<bell>VIVA Saddam Hussain.!!<bell><cr><lf><lf>

The non-displayed message:

KILL IMPERIALISTS.!

Any good anti-virus or integrity program that finds the STONED should
also reveal this version.

Removal from a hard disk is the same, copy absolute sector 7 (the real
MBR) back to absolute sector 1. On floppies, it is best to copy off
any needed files and reformat the disk. (always boot from a known
clean write-protected floppy by cycling power before attempting any
removal.)

Subject: Zenith Dos Writes (PC)

Some versions (or maybe all versions) of Zenith MSDOS write the date
and time someplace in the system every time you write a file.  If you
have a system without a real-time clock, you can prove this by not
setting date and time when you boot up.  It will be set to the time of
the last file write.  This does, of course, upset all kinds of
virus-hunting programs.
  (I have, on occasion, taken advantage of this property of my Zenith
158).

Subject: PREVENTION of Drive A: boots - Suggestions Please (PC)

To minimise and manage virusses at our institution I wish to prevent
PC's being booted off Drive A: and only permit booting off the Hard
Disk.  This of course immediately presents a management problem of
what to do if the Hard Disk goes bad and I need to boot off a floppy.
So ideally any solution needs to address this situation. Two
possibilities spring to mind:

a.	Use of a ROM. This would sit in the appropriate address space and be
	detected during the BIOS boot.  The code would need to at least
	prevent floppy boots and desirably check for a floppy with a particular
	label and if detected permit the floppy boot.  This would overcome the
	problem of a clobbered hard disk.

b.	Use of hardware modifications connected to a key switch mounted on
	the case which would be used to enable/disable floppy boots.  On our
	machines the keyboard lock could be used for this purpose.

If you have a solution that does not address all the problems still
respond.  ALL suggestions help welcome.  For option a., actual code
and/or technical specs would be appreciated.  For option b., specific
details please. We run both Wyse 286's and PROTECH 386sx's(towers) all
with hard disks.  If I get a meaningful response I'll post a summary.

Yes, you are somewhat correct about the present situation - I was
unclear in what I was trying to say, although I would still say that
the problem would be a lot less serious if the users had habits of not
booting from every other floppy and using floppies borrowed from a
neighbour.

What I really should have pointed out is that computer viruses wouldn't
be a serious problem if the commonly-used operating systems had even
some decent protection mechanisms provided by the operating system.
By 'commonly-used OSs' I'm now referreing to MacOS (whatever that's
really called) and MS-DOS.  Viruses are not a serious problem on Unix
or VMS or VM/something, because the OS provides at least some minimum
access control mechanisms.

It helps not to boot from friends' floppies, only install programs to
your computer from reliable sources like known vendors and free
software distributors, distribute the installable programs in
write-protected disks, scan the programs you install with some virus
detector and some other simple precautions.  If you do the above,
viruses won't get to your system very often, and it doesn't seem to
make life much more difficult.

>Including source code with every program would help eliminate viruses,
>but forgive me if I only pay attention to realistic options.

Well, dunno, I have source source code to every program I run on my
home system and every part of the system, even the ROM monitor and the
PCB.  Oh, not every part exactly, I don't have the source code to the
chips (like the processor), there might be some trojans hidden there..

>Likewise
>running only programs not written by "persons with an equal lack of
>knowledge".  Whatever that means.

It means something like running an OS whose designers had enough
common sense and expertise to put at least some most basic access
control mechanisms in the OS.  Same goes for applications.

Yup: Virex-PC (Version 1.2 and later) will scan inside of PKLITE
files, including the "extra compression method".  You should be able
to get a copy of VIRX, the demo, at most BBS's -- call mine at

Subject: Re: Viruses

There was a question of 'Cezar' about an assumed virus (COMMAND.COM
increased in size, message 'P-CK (1M), etc.). Jeroen W. Pluimers and
Jeroen Smulders ask some questions to get more information about the
problem.

My opinion: P-CK has nothing (?) to do with a virus, it is the
announcement of a parity-check error of the memory on the PC mainboard
( or memory card).  The system will not boot (i.e. 'hangs') if parity
errors occur in the RAM- banks. You should boot your system from a
known-good floppy and run a good memory test program. If your system
appears sick, you will have to fix it before you can go for the
virus-bust (if present at all ...)

Good luck!

Subject: Azusa Virus Found on factory diskettes

The Azusa virus has appeared at DTRC.  While checking software for
viruses, I found the Azusa virus on several diskettes belonging to a
systems I was checking out.  Upon further investigation, I made a
startling discovery.  The Azusa virus was found on one of the VGA
utilities disks.

This disk was a 5 1/4 1.2mb HD floppy and was factory read only (no
notch).  The virus was on disk one of a three disk set.

The disks were labeled TVGA - 8916.  According to the manual, TVGA is
a trademark of "Trident Microsystems, Inc.

I notified our supplier of this finding and had them check their
remaining supply of TVGA software and they verified that ALL of their
disk one of three TVGA - 8916 utilities disks were infected with the
Azusa virus.

This supplier told me that at least 10,000 TVGA units per week are
being distributed worldwide by many suppliers.

I would suggest that if you have these drivers, they should not be
used until verified to be virus-free.
