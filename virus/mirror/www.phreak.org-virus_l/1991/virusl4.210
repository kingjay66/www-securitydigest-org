VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

One of the new viruses listed in the November edition of the Virus
Bulletin is named "Gosia".  The search pattern provided there is
invalid, as it causes a serious false alarm - it can be found in all
versions of COMMAND.COM.

Please ignore this pattern.  A replacement will be published next month.

Incorrect, exchange your BIOS to include the following
processor-start-up *software* (though its as drastic as the "off
switch" but it is software :-) ):

1) Disable all interrupts.
2) Redirect NMI vector to a "reti" instruction.
2) Execute a "Halt" instruction which stops the processor.

We have UNIX systems with a Software-switch-off function. If an
"Antiviral" package immediately activates this function the system
will be switched off and can not be infected. Is this Hardware
protection? No, because Hardware alone can not do it (it will not
switch off by itself). Is this Software protection? No software alone
can not do it (after software triggered the hardware, the hardware
will switch the system off).

I don't know any Hardware protection boards but I assume that a board
like the "Thunderbyte" board will contain *software* (are there
(E)PROM's on it?), and I guess its the *software* on that board that
prevents from viruses, not the hardware! (but like I said, I don't
know the board).

I think the power in these applications is that its a *combination* of
hardware and software. Think of what software can do if I had a very
fast RISC processor with 80486 emulating software. This emuation
software could easely track suspicous acticvity, but could not be
changed by software running on the emulator! This has the potential
equal to any hardware solution. (Note that your "hardware" CPU is also
running a *software* micro-program inside it and no one is able to
change that program with any virus either).

Henk.

I'm looking for information on the "Stoned" virus.  Included:
	How it attaches itself to disks
	How it copies itself (through RAM, etc)
	What it does to the system
	Where it came from
	Likely sources

One of our clients (where I work) thinks they got it from us.  Our
site is completely virus-free, and we are trying to get a better
understanding of the virus so that we can prove that we are not liable
(and possibly help them determine who is.)

In #208, Jeff Johnson asks:

Sure are, Jeff. MacAfee's SCAN is useable (and callable) from inside a
program I've been trying called SHEZ. SHEZ will allow you to look
inside any format you like; ARC, ZIP ARJ, PAK, or what have you.

It won't look inside self extractors, but then you knew that I'd guess.

This is partly why I got so upset... :-) I knew that there is
something new there, so I couldn't just drop all the mess and forget
about it. No, I had to analyze everything... :-((

I've had trouble loading VIRSTOP high under DOS 5.  I simply haven't been
able to get it to *load* high at all.  It loads low and runs fine, but I'm
apparently missing something.  :)

I had a problem with loading VIRSTOP under QEMM v5.13 as well, but that
problem has gone away with QEMM 6.0.  Loads and runs very nicely now, thank
you.

Hmm, with the amount of personal Unix boxes selled nowdays, I guess
that in the near future we'll see at least attempts to spread Unix
viruses. For instance viruses that run only on a single Unix platform
(e.g., 80386)...

This is, of course, true, but the situation is changing, IMHO...

Sure. But I have seen advertisements for products that were advertized
as anti-virus programs, while in fact they were integrity checkers -
they computer checksums. This will, of course, catch viruses as well,
but it is also a useful tool for any kind of integrity corruption.

Yes, that's true, there is indeed a major naming confusion between the
different researchers. When I started to organize the virus collection
at the VTC I found a virus present twice even in it! But usually I was
able to cope with the different names that the different researchers
from whom we get viruses use. This confusion cannot be even compared
with the confusion that 1775 unnamed files caused! (Again, I'm
speaking only about myself here. Probably the others are cleverer than
me.) The files that had nothing to do with viruses (as Fridrik
Skulason pointed out) just added more to the confusion... :-(

Oh, I assumed that. Obviously it should make sense to someone.
However, if it is supplied to other, it should try to make sense to

My (personal) oppinion was based on the state of the virus collection
that we received, I think that I clearly stated that. I continue to
think that this state was horrible and that -it- didn't show good
level of expertize in the anti-virus research. That's the only reason
why I expressed my doubts that the people who call this "virus
collection" are able to test anti-virus products reliably. Imagine a
report that says "F-Prot was not able to detect 30 % of the files in
our virus collection"... Sure, if they don't contain any viruses...
:-) Anyway, I'm glad to hear that Mr. Stang is improving the state of
NCSA's collection.

The first time I heard this problem was after someone had stolen the
1M SIMMs out of a 5M Mac II (the remaining 256K SIMMs were left in the
"high" slots, which won't work for a 1M setup.)  I've also heard it
from one machine we had in which the SIMMs needed to be reseated about
once a month...

Coincidence, because SAM didn't exist when nVIR was written.  I would
guess that for some reason, you have only a partial infection. Get out
your locked backup disk and reload SAM.  Also, make sure that you
install the SAM init, sounds like it might not have been running, or
that your machine was booted from an untested System disk. Tell
anybody who wants to use your Mac that they may, but only if they
disinfect their disks first. Leave SAM Virus Clinic running when you
go out of the office if you have to.

Subject: F-PROT 2.01 is available (PC)

Version 2.01 of F-PROT is now available.  It is a few days behind
schedule, but look at the list of new viruses below, and you see why :-)

The program has been sent out by mail and E-mail, and should be
available on the major archive sites (such as Simtel20) now or within
a couple of days, but I have just uploaded it myself to
oak.oakland.edu (/pub/msdos/trojan-pro).

VIRSTOP.EXE from version 2.00 started to complain on Nov. 1. that it
was too old, and should be replaced - a minor bug, it should not have
done so until Dec. 1.  Version 2.01 will start complaining in four
months or so.

No major new features were added in 2.01 - it just fixed some bugs in
2.00, and added detection/removal of a lot of now viruses - over 100.

Version 2.01 - corrections:

   The name of the main program was changed from F2.EXE to F-PROT.EXE,
   as several other programs (including a part of Microsoft's FORTRAN
   compiler) were already named F2.EXE

   Some problems regarding user-defined signatures have been fixed.

   A false alarm of a "Whale" infection in the GMOUSE.COM (Genius Mouse
   driver) and a program named XTRA.COM has been corrected.

   Version 2.00 would not work in interactive mode on a machine with a XGA
   or a Monochrome MCGA display.  This has been corrected.

   Some characters above 128 were corrupted if a report was saved to a
   file.

   If floppy drives were installed with other identifiers than  A: and B:,
   the program would try to access them on startup, which caused problems
   if no disk was inserted.

   The "Analysis" function now produces fewer false positives than before,
   and known false positives are now listed in ANALYSE.DOC

   The program should now work without problems on Zenith DOS 3.30 PLUS.

   Some variants of the Vacsina virus were occasionally not disinfected
   correctly - this has been fixed.

   The Amoeba virus was not detected in .COM files with size above a
   certain length, although it was always stopped by VIRSTOP.  Fixed.

Version 2.01 - improvements:

   VIRSTOP.EXE can now be loaded as a device-driver, with a DEVICE=
   or DEVICEHIGH= command from CONFIG.SYS.

   Two command-line switches were added:

      /NOMEM    skip the initial memory scan.  It should only
                be used if the computer is known to be "clean".

      /USER     scan for user-defined virus patterns.

   The program used to scan subdirectories in "reverse" order - this has
   now been changed.

   F-PROT.EXE is now distributed in packed (run-time unpacking) form, so
   that the the entire package fits on one 360K diskette after unpacking.

Version 2.01 - new viruses:

  The following 89 new viruses (or new variants of old viruses) can be
  detected and removed with version 2.01

    864, 1876, Akuku-Copmpl, AT-144, Backtime (Blinker, Joker and Shaker),

    Minimal-30-B, Mono-1063, MPS-OPC (1.1, 3.1 and 3.2), MSTU,
    Murphy-Brothers, Old Yankee-Black Wizard, Omega, Path, PC-Flu,
    Pixel (Polish-457, Polish-550, 897, 899-A, 899-B and 905),
    Plovdiv (New Bulgarian 800), Polish Color, Polish Minimal-45, Semtex,
    Seventh son, Spanz, Socha, Something, StinkFoot, SVC-1740, Tony, Traveller,
    Twin, Vienna (634, 656, 726 and 776 byte variants, Violator B/B3),
    Voronezh-370, W13 (C, 377 and REQ!), Words (1069, 1085, 1387 and 1503),
    Yankee (1150 and 1202 byte variants)

                       Change detection

A virus has to change *something*.

This fact is absolutely fundamental to the operation of computer
viral programs, and therefore, in a sense, provides a guaranteed
form of virus prevention or detection.  If we make a machine
that cannot change anything (and the disadvantages of this have
been thoroughly discussed) we can prevent infection.  If any
change made can be detected, then any infection can be detected,
although discriminating between an infection and a valid change
remains problematic.

It is interesting to note that the early antiviral programs, at
least the most widely used ones, relied first upon activity
monitoring and then signature scanning.  Nowadays almost all
antiviral programs implement some version of automated change
detection.  The detection of the first viri, and the ongoing
research into new strains, relies almost entirely on "manual"
methods of change detection.

This method of detection is available to anyone who has a
computer and the most basic tools of the operating system.  It
is, of course, made somewhat easier with the more advanced
"utility" programs available on the market, but the best defence
remains a thorough knowledge of your computer, and what it is
supposed to be doing.

A knowledge of what programs are on the computer, and a list of
file sizes and creation dates is a simple piece of protection
requiring no special programs whatsoever.  This one simple tool,
however, can provide detection of most file infecting viri.  It
will even detect "stealth" viri if the computer is booted from a
clean system disk before the check is made.

DEBUG is provided with every copy of MS-DOS, and can be used to
view, and make a copy of, the boot record of every disk.
(Partition boot records of hard disks are beyond the reach of
DEBUG, but within the reach of F-PBR, from 1.xx versions of
FPROT.)

Memory maps (and hex dumps of boot sectors) are not easy to
read, even for experienced, but non-programming, users.
However, it is not necessary that the user understand all the
entries in a boot sector or memory map.  It is only necessary
that the user have a printout of a run of, say, MEM/C in an
initially clean state, and then be able to spot a difference in
a subsequent run of the program.

In reality, of course, most users will not take the time and
trouble to check for changes in the system.  Most users want a
program which will do it for them, and preferably one which will
do the checking automatically, and alert them to anything wrong.
