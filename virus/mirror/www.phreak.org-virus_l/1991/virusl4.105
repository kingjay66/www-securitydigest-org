General Description:

Victor Charlie is a series of batch and data files that generate a
number of programs for trapping of viral infections.  There is also
provision for the capture of viral signatures.  Utilities are included
for viewing of boot sectors and recovery of hard disk system areas.
Requires DEBUG.COM for some operations.

Version 5.0 has, as of this writing, been released, but has not yet been
received for review.  Due to the novelty of the program, and its
relative anonymity in North America and Europe, I am releasing this
review now, with some notes about version 5.0, rather than wait for the
next version.

                  Comparison of features and specifications



User Friendliness

Installation

The installation procedure outlined in the manual starts "earlier" in
the process than any other reviewed so far.  Not only does it recommend
booting from a floppy, but it suggests that you SYS and replace the
COMMAND.COM file on the hard disk before doing anything else.  An
initial "Quick Start" section of the manual relies on an intermediate
knowledge of MS-DOS by the user, but this is stated at the beginning.
(Unfortunately, it does not immediately point novice users to the later,
and more detailed, VINSTALLATION chapter, nor does it point out the
possible dangers of replacing the operating system on the hard disk.
Also, although there is some discussion is the alter chapter about the
DOS disk, some discussion of the importance of write protection of the
original disks might avoid possibilities for infection at this point.)

Installation of VC is not foolproof by any means.  Almost all error
messages are hidden from the user, and a lack of file space or an
incorrect assumption regarding drive specifications will cause the
installation to fail to complete.  This, however, is not communicated to
the user, and may not be obvious.  To the novice this can be dangerous,
in that the user may consider that the system is protected when, in
fact, it is not.  Experienced users will be able to custom tailor the
installation to their own needs, since everything is done through batch
files.

Although the documentation does indicate that the package can be run on
floppy only systems, installations onto floppies is problematic.  If the
command VINSTALL A: is given, the system will determine that A: is not a
hard drive, and install only a portion of the full set of files.  If,
however, the command VINSTALL A:\VC is given, the program will not
determine that A: is a floppy.  When installing to a floppy drive, the
boot sector and other system areas are "protected" (VC will detect an
infection by a BSI), but not reparable (the back file of the boot sector
is not generated.)  A floppy installation program, FINSTALL.BAT, is
provided, but it does not seem to work properly unless called from
VINSTALL.  Even then, on every attempt to install the program terminated
with an error message about an improper drive or path specification.

Although not mentioned in the manual until page 64, DEBUG.COM is
required by a number of VC's programs.  It should be on the computer,
and in a directory in the active path.

Options in regard to installation are legion, but should be performed
only by experienced users, as they are not necessarily well explained
for the novice.

Path and directory settings are vitally important, and it is quite
possible to generate additional copies of the program which no longer
will trap changes to programs.

Ease of use

The ability to use the programs effectively is very much dependent upon
the installation chosen.  With proper installation, occasional virus
checks can be as simple as a single keystroke (Alt-V).

The program can, however, give conflicting messages.  When the Stoned
virus was active, it correctly detected that something had happened to
the boot sequence.  On a floppy system it was not able to recover the
boot sector, but finished the sequence with a message that "Right now,
you have NO active virus on this computer."

Help systems

There is help of various sorts provided for, but in testing the program
very often "lost" its help file, even when installed as directed.

When a virus is detected, the messages that appear give a useful
explanation of what has happened and why.  The steps to take, and
optional explanations of what has happened are realistic, and should be
clear even to a novice.

Compatibility

Although no part of the package is "resident", it warns against having
TSR's active during installation.

Company Stability

The program is produced by Bangkok Security Associates (programmer John
DeHaven, technical writer Alan Dawson, marketing director Simon Royle
and financial director Ramesh Indhewat).  BSA is a Thai company
registered in the British Virgin Islands from Hong Kong.

Company Support

In Australia, where the product has had its major success to date, the
product is supported by Combat Software.  Otherwise company support is
provided by the BBS listed above.

Documentation

The manual is entertainingly written, and contains a great deal of
information on viral programs in general.  Parts of the manual explain
computer operations to the novice in great detail.  There are, however,
other parts that give out brief, or even misleading, information.

(A note on this business of directions to novice users.  It may seem
like a "fractal" type of problem, in that no matter how much you
explain, there is still more to do.  For example, TBSCAN's documentation
suggests write protecting diskettes, and explains how to do it on a 3.5"
diskette, but not on a 5.25".  Victor Charlie does explain that you
should put a "... sticker ... over the notch at the right-hand side of
the disk when you look at it from the front."  However, failing to
mention that the notch is *square*, on the *side* of the disk cover and
that you cannot see the magnetic disk through it might allow some to
permanently read *and* write protect the disk by placing the sticker
over the drive head access slot.  Still, in many cases Victor Charlie
gives the best explanation to novice users yet reviewed.)

The tone of the documentation (both hardcopy and on disk) varies between
jingoism ("... ultimate security ... defeat any current or future
virus") and realism, while ultimately falling somewhat short in terms of
actual details.  In testing the system, I came to the conclusion that,
while suitable for any users as a warning system, technical personnel
will need more details as to the ultimate effectiveness, and how far to
trust the package.

Hardware Requirements

MS-DOS 2.0 or higher and a minimum 64K of RAM.

Performance

Unfortunately, even at this point, I am unable to state the performance
of the system with confidence.  It will find viral infections of
programs, and of boot sectors.  (In spite of the difficulties
encountered in installing the system to a floppy, it had no difficulty
in identifying "Stoned" infections on floppy.  Further testing revealed
that it was, somehow, detecting a change in the boot sector, rather than
memory.  Although the program checks memory and the system areas of the
disk, the "signatures" of the original system are not stored with
program file signatures.)

The actions of the package as a whole, regenerating itself from batch
and data files, are quite fascinating.  The program is a radical
departure from any other reviewed system, and should be a valuable extra
component for system security.

The change detection of the signature list may possibly be bypassed by a
sophisticated virus, as it depends upon file length and checksum, rather
than some of the more rigourous mathematical methods.  However, the
checksum is described by the company as "double-encrypted", and the
method of calculation and protection, while not user definable, is not
uniform throughout any release of the product.

The program, as it stands, is most useful against memory resident,
program file infecting viri.  Specific identification of sources of
infection is not strong.

Local Support

In Australia, provided by Combat Software.

Support Requirements

Installation of the program is possible for novice users with standard
computer configurations, but should likely be supported for any non-
standard systems.  Novice or intermediate users will require assistance
to identify the source of infection if a virus is detected.

                                 General Notes

This package is quite fascinating in its novel approach to virus
detection.  There are numerous shortcomings, but the approach could be a
valuable adjunct to current methods.  While the current implementation
has significant shortcomings, particularly in non-standard
configurations, the concept is a valuable one and, hopefully, future
development will make the package more valuable as a stand alone
product.

Version 5.0 is said to be a major rewrite and upgrade.  The virus
signature library, which contains only two signatures in version 4.01,
will identify all viral programs identified as "common" in the Hoffman
Summary listing (the date of the listing is not specified.)  The library
will also "accumulate" signatures as new viral programs are encountered.

Changes effective in version 5.0 will include a new interface and
installation process.  New utilities will be added, and protection
against "stealth" viri will be enhanced.  System requirements will
increase to 256K RAM and DOS 3.0 or higher, but the use of DEBUG.COM
will be dropped.  The documentation will include a 200 page book on
computer viral operations, with separate version specific technical
references.

General Description:

IBM's VIRSCAN product appears to fall somewhat oddly between commercial
software and shareware.  Although IBM retains all rights to the program
(in a license agreement written as only IBM can), there is no printed
documentation, and the package is available on either single disks or
via the IBMLINK service.  The price is reasonable for an individual, but
almost absurdly low given the "enterprise wide" license.

VIRSCAN is a non-resident scanner with a non-encrypted and user
extensible signature file.  Command line switches can be used to obtain
a variety of information about the system.  The program makes no attempt
to disinfect or delete infections.

Recommended for any situation, but particularly for medium to large
companies and for intermediate to advanced users.
                  Comparison of features and specifications



User Friendliness

Installation

VIRSCAN, when supplied on disk, is shipped on "non-writable" diskettes.

IBM does not suggest installation on the hard drive at all.  The
suggested use of the program is to boot from a protected floppy, and run
the program from the floppy disk.  The documentation does give
directions on how to prepare a bootable floppy with the scanning program
on it.  These directions are very complete.  (Directions are even given
on how to write protect a 3 1/2" floppy disk, although they are not as
explicit for 5 1/4" disks.)

An explanation of "resident" viri is given, and directions for booting
from the original system floppy are given.  The directions do assume
that you have original IBM equipment and operating system disks, but
should be clear for most systems, even for novice users.

The documentation is written with the novice user in mind, and is, in
places, excellent.  Some "obvious" steps are missing in the directions,
but by and large they are very clear, and cover ground often missing in
the documentation of other products.

Ease of use

As the product has evolved, a number of command line switches have been
added.  The default settings, however, are very well chosen, and novice
users should not need to know the various options.  Advanced users will
be able to use them without problems.

One possible problem is that by default the scan proceeds to conclusion
even when the screen has filled with warning messages.  This should not
be a problem in normal operation, but may be of concern in scanning a
heavily infected system.  (The "-Z" switch will, however, cause the
program to pause at each signature found and this may be an acceptable
alternative.)

Help systems

Two levels of help are available from the command line, called by
switches.  (Somewhat counterintuitively, the "?" switch gives more
extensive and complicated assistance than does the "??" switch.)  As the
program is run from the command line only, "onscreen help" is not an
issue.

Compatibility

VIRSCAN will run under both DOS and OS/2, and will examine drives with
both DOS/FAT and HPFS file structures.

The structure of the signature file is outlined in the manual, and at
least one other scanning program obtained for evaluation (Thunderbyte
Scan from Frans Veldman) uses this same file format as a standard.  This
allows the use of additional signature information with the program, and
also allows users to add new signatures to update the package, or their
own signatures if a new virus is found.

Mention is made in the documentation of a switch to disable "high
memory" checking, which appears to indicate that the program will check
high memory by default.  The extent of this is not, however, clearly
specified in the documentation.  In a communication from David Chess, it
was explained that "high memory" is defined as the area between 640K and
1 meg.  No scanning is done above 1 meg.  (Note that when run from OS/2,
the program does *not* check system memory.  Memory is only checked when
the program is run from DOS or the DOS compatibility box.)

Company Stability

They'll probably be around for a while.

Company Support

Those on the Internet and Usenet who receive VIRUS-L/comp.virus will
have access to David Chess' postings and email address.  IBMLINK
subscribers will have access to upgrades and information.

Documentation

The documentation is available only in softcopy on the disk.  While
sections are excellent, the presentation and order of the manual
(VIRSCAN.DOC) would likely be daunting to the novice.

A major strength is the discussion of the weaknesses of the program, and
a warning against trusting it too far.

Hardware Requirements

The documentation does not state any minimum requirements for operation.

Performance

While VIRSCAN does not search for as many viri as FPROT or SCAN, it
catches all common viri.  Speed of operation is neither the slowest nor
the fastest tested, and is quite acceptable.

Note that VIRSCAN makes no attempt to disinfect or delete infected
files.

Local Support

Local support, even from IBM staff, is unfortunately undependable.
There are numerous instances of those staff who should, presumably, be
familiar with the product being unaware of its particulars and
availability, or even giving out false information.  (I was twice
contacted by IBM staff who *offered* to get me copies of the program for
evaluation, and then were unable to find it themselves.)  There have
been a number of cases of IBM local representatives giving versions
intended for internal use only to outside clients.

Support Requirements

The program should be suitable for any user.  Support staff will find
additional functions that novice users would not use.

If, however, an infection is detected, additional support will be
required.  It is likely that only advanced users would be able to take
effective action, and even then would likely require other antiviral
packages to correct the situation.

                                 General Notes

This product is an excellent value for any company.  It is easy to see
that IBM could lose control over the integrity of the product if it were
to be distributed as shareware or "freeware".  It is also reasonable
that IBM be allowed to make some return on the resources devoted to this
product.  That said, I still could wish for some attempt to make the
product more available to the general user community.

The lack of support available through IBM representatives is disturbing.
Against, while it is understandable that not all staff can be expert in
all products, the lack of support for a product of such universal
importance is to be regretted.

In comparison to other scanners, the lack of disinfection would tend to
make this product an adjunct rather than the only tool used.  It is
still, though, a high quality tool, and could easily be chosen as the
primary virus alert product.

General Description:

VirAway is identical to the CURE program shipped with AntiVirus Plus
from Techmar.  The program is recommended only to "backstop" other
systems, and should not be depended upon as the only means of antivirus
protection in its current form.

                  Comparison of features and specifications



User Friendliness

Installation

VirAway, as shipped to me, comes completely unprotected.  This may not
be the usual form, as the disk documentation contains a READ.ME file
which states that no changes have been made to the documentation, while
I received no documentation with the package.

An installation program is provided, which will only install from drive
A: to the C: drive in a directory called \VIRAWAY.  However, as
installation consists solely of copying three files (and one "startup"
batch file to the root directory), it is not difficult for the
intermediate user to perform a "custom" installation.

Ease of use

Although VirAway came with no documentation, it responds to the same
command line switches as does CURE.  (Not terribly surprising: not only
are the files identical in size, but CURE, when run, identifies itself
as version 1.46 of VirAway.)  Again, if no switches are used, the
program will present a menu of options.

However, command line switches seem to be only able to "add" to the
default options.  (For example, one cannot turn off the display of final
statistics from the command line invocation.)

There is an annoying bug in the program when allowed to disinfect: it
appears to count both the infection detected, and the cleaning process,
as an infection.  The final statistics will indicate that 1 file virus
was found, and one cleaned, but will show the virus named as having
caused two infections.  (If two files are, in fact, infected, the
display shows only two infections.)

Help systems

None provided.

Compatibility

As stated in the review of AntiVirus Plus, VirAway will find most common
viri, but will not find the AIDS virus.

VirAway will find viri active in memory, and, in testing, rendered them
inactive.  However, sufficient traces remained in memory to set off
alarms from other virus scanners.

Company Stability

Techmar is the distributor of IRIS products (from Israel) in the United
States.

Company Support

The evaluation copy of AntiVirus Plus was shipped in good time, although
Techmar had not properly filled in the customs declaration.  The copy of
VirAway came unsolicited, which seems to indicate an active marketing
group if nothing else.

Documentation

Not supplied.

Hardware Requirements

MS-DOS 2.0 or higher, 256K memory.  The promotional material states that
a dual floppy system is necessary, which conflicts with the installation
batch file.

Performance

Detection of viral programs appears to be sufficient for most
situations.  Disinfection of memory appears effective, with the proviso
noted above about false alarms from other scanners.  (According to
memory mapping utilities, the memory is also still "reserved".)
Disinfection of boot sector viri appears to be effective.  Disinfection
of program files appears effective as to the virus removal, but may
leave programs damaged.

During testing, the memory was infected with the Jerusalem B virus
(which VirAway reports as "Black Friday #1").  When VirAway was run, the
virus was rendered inactive in memory, but it had already infected the
VirAway program file.  VirAway then disinfected itself, but increased in
size from 81835 to 81840 bytes on disk.  Subsequent runs with the
program against test sets of viri showed some odd behaviour and an
inability to identify all previously identified viri.  Also, subsequent
runs of VirAway in memory showed a lack of ability to remove infections
from memory.

Local Support

None provided.

Support Requirements

The program, while fairly simple to run, would not necessarily be
suitable for novice users.  Disinfection of viral infections is probably
best left to experienced staff (and possibly other programs.)

                                 General Notes

As it stands, the program cannot be highly recommended.  The number of
viri detected are low even by the standards of other (admittedly more
expensive) programs.  The disinfection ability is somewhat questionable,
and therefore undependable.
