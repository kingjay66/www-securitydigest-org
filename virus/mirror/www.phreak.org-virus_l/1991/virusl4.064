VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,

The problem with the joke is that I did run across a trojan horse that
did activate on 4/1. If the system clock was reset to a date prior to
4/1, no music played when the infected files were accessed... however,
any date =>4/1 caused numerous songs. It was not benign.. In trying to
trap and eradicate the virus, it hit the File Allocation Table and
wiped out all access to the drive. They were using DOS 4.01, and my
software tools couldn't salvage the disk.

I've devirused a number of systems and networks; this little sucker
was not a joking matter.

I agree that there should be a limit to "jokes" but it seems to me
that such articles are easily spotted if read in full and have their
own merit in the form of some relief from the serious and morbid
atmospheres in this industry with a small light-hearted beam of
joviality!  I don't know about you, but I don't belive anything
written in journals, magazines, newspapers etc.  without confirmation
from a reliable source (none of the previous fit into this category,
IMHO).  To go off in a big flap over an obvious april fools joke is a
sign that a holiday/vacation should be the next course of action.

Have a laugh - you'd be surprised how good it can make you feel!

A direct quote from Hypertalk Reference stack (2.0): "If you send a
message directly to Hypercard, you ensure that no other objects will
handle the message."  This includes the Home stack script, no matter
what kind of HyperGatekeeper you've installed in your Home stack.  Not
only could the virus spread to your home stack, it could then spread
to any other stack w/o warning from your "on set" script.

In my testing of the Norton Antivirus program (see the reviews in the
cert and MIBSRV archives) it identified 3 versions of the Stoned
virus.  I do not have copies of the "Stoned II/Donald Duck" versions,
so I can't vouch for that.

Subject: Self-extracting files (PC, mostly, I guess)

Since this got chopped up good, the first time ...

We've had various discussions on the merits of "archived" and "self-
extracting" files for virus protection.  The following is from a local
bulletin board:

Original message from: Rene Blais, to: All --
RB> simple way to detect viruses without scan or any similar
RB> program, as long as the virus infects EXE files no
RB> self-extracting compressed files will work as the virus
RB> scrambles the code. just a friendly hint from your friendly
RB> neighborhood virus-hater

I'm afraid it isn't that simple, Rene.

If the virus is an "overwriting" type, then yes this procedure should
work.  However, if the virus is a "prepender" then it will execute
*before* the code that decompresses the program.  The self extraction
module then may or may not fail to successfully run the program,
depending upon how it deals with the additional code at the beginning
of the file.  In any case, if the viral program is one that "goes
resident", then the machine's memory is infected.

If the virus is an "appender", most of the same applies.  It will have
a "jump" placed at the beginning of the file to the virus code at the
end, and then a "jump" instruction to the beginning of the file and,
again, executes the virus before the self-extraction module starts to
work.  As with the prepender, the extraction of the program may or may
not be affected by the presence of header and trailer information.

However, in the case of the newer "spawning" viral programs, this
procedure does nothing at all for detection, because "spawning" viri
never touch the original file, relying on MS-DOS's "execution order
preference" for .COM files, and creating a separate virus file.  The
separate file may be hidden from detection in various ways, and still
be "infectious."

Klaus Brunnstein's excellent Computer Virus Catalog covers all the
bases: MS-DOS, Mac, Atari and Amiga.  I do recall some difficulties
they have had obtaining samples for Amiga viri, since Amiga users tend
to want to "swap", and CARO won't do that.

Subject: Stoned Problems (PC)

We are having problems with STONED here at Teesside Polytechnic.  We
can detect it on our hard disks using SCAN and then get rid of it
using CLEAN, although we can detect it on floppies CLEAN hangs when we
try to get rid of it and the floppy is subsequently unusable.

The weird thing is that the floppies don't have any programs on them,
the particular case I dealt with just had 3 disks of wordstar files.
Does STONED scramble the FAT? Can it "hang around" in memory so that
SCAN reports the A drive as being infected although it is not on the
floppy in the A drive? Can STONED scramble the FAT of a floppy in the
A drive from the C drive or from memory?

Any help gratefully received.

Subject: New virus at Oxford? (PC)

Can anyone help us please. We are seeing a lot of corrupt PC files
recently from various departments in the university. They all have the
same file header which includes a small capital e with an accent acute
followed by the characters MSDOS3.3 then a load of garbage. The
software that created the files is unable to read them. We've scanned
some of the machines that produced these file with McAfee's SCAN v76.
SCAN doesn't detect anything.

Has anyone any ideas. I'm stuck except to suggest to the people
affected to do a low-level format and restore their software from
known clean copies.

Could you please pass on my thanks to A. Padgett for his reply to my
last query about IDE drives. I've tried to mail him personally but
keep getting unhelpful messages at my end about "site unknown".

Thanks in advance.

Greetings,
    Beg to differ, but...
    [Wherein I deleted, a description of a very successful VMS worm,
based on version numbers]
    <Sigh> There really *ARE* some things a person shouldn't post.
Suffice it to say that a person I knew used the version number
facility of VMS to make 'script spoofs' easy.  (As well as using MBX's
as a 'trapdoor' facility which trapped the System manager even.
Scary.  Took less than a few days.)

    The 'version numbering' of VMS makes it susceptible to worms and
such.  DCL worms, also, have been around a while.

    All these things require that people run things out of other's
accounts.  However, in an educational environment this can be
considered to hold true.  In many other environments as well.

    The problem here is that *WORMS* are easy on almost any system,
but Viruses seem to be only 'easy' on PC's.  (I consider a worm a
program of which there is an entirely *SEPERATE* program, and a
virus a program which incorporates itself into the main program.)

    If you are running a Un*x system, work on the intricacies of
protections.  Proper passwording, proper protection, make sure your
users are 'security aware'.  Run COPS on your system occasionally.
For the most part, you won't need to worry about worms or viruses.
As Padgett says, you've got great protections available.  Now *USE*
them!

    Of course if you *DO* run into one, comp.virus/VIRUS-L would
probably be very interested in it.

Subject: Norton Anti-Virus (PC)

In testing the Norton Anti-Virus product against a file with multiple
infections of the Jerusalem B virus, I found that it will remove only
one instance of the virus at a time.  It reports that the virus has
been "successfully removed" even though the remaining copies of the
virus remain attached to the file.  Other products I've tested will
remove all instances of a multiple infection automatically, without
user intervention.  I consider this aspect of the Norton product to be
a serious defect and I would hope to see it corrected in a subsequent
release.

I have to agree with you there. It seems that as the days goes by,
there are stranger and stranger cases in the Amermican courts. People
are being sued from anything to everything. There was a joke about
this I read somewhere (can't recall where). The relevant part of the
story goes something like this. A lady trips over a branch on the
sidewalk in front of a building. She sues the gardener of the building
for malpractice, sues the owner of the building for negligence, sues
the city for pollution, sues the county for lack of control over its
cities, sues the State for not increasing the city spending for the
purchase of one more street cleaner, and sues President Bush for not
buying that Nintendo Danny wants so that he can actually be doing
something.

>Go ahead with your lawsuit. I suspect it will be thrown out
>of court.

I'm not so sure about that. I have seen some strange decisions before.
You know what they say in the US, if you have enough money to pay for
a good lawyer, you can get away with murder (or seek refuge in
Canada). :)

But come now. A joke is a joke. We all know what April fools mean.  I
thought Americans are supposed to be funloving, free spirited group of
fellows. Not to mention freedom of speech and all that jazz.

I've keep quite about this because I enjoy a good yuck as much as the
next person.  However, there are a lot of people that read a variety
of magazines just for info and pleasure that do not have the
math/physics/computer background to understand the sillyness of what
was written.

There are a lot of neophytes running around making all kinds of
decisions about computers that affect entire companies.  Articles like
this one do an incredible disservice and create more uneasiness about
computers and viruses.  Computer viruses are NOT something to joke
about.  Several years ago I lost an entire 40Mb hard disk to something
(probably a trojan but I could never find it) Even though I had
backups I lost quite a bit of work that cost me several months to
recreate.

Viruses and trojans are not something that should be joked about,
especially if there is the slightest chance that the "joke" could fall
into a novices lap.

Subject: the MDEF series of viruses (Mac)

    Hi.  I was wondering if someone could help me with a slight
problem I seem to be having.  I'm a graduate student here at UB (SUNY
Buffalo), and I work in a laboratory that has 4 Macs (3 SE/30s and a
IIsi).  Recently, we found that two of the SE/30s were infected with a
virus called MDEF C.  We tried to use SAM on it, but the best we could
do was detect the infected files - SAM couldn't repair them.  Only
applications and the desktop were infected by this virus.

    Our solution was to simply delete the infected files, rebuild the
desktop, and reinstall new versions of the System, Finder, and other
infected applications.  However, some of the other students aren't
sure whether SAM is going to be effective in detecting this again, as
it didn't notify any of us about the infected floppy disk in the first
place.  Are there any free- or shareware virus protection/disinfection
programs available?  I had copies of Binhex and Stuffit which I was
fiddling around with, and they got infected, so I can't readily go the
archives to get programs...

    Also, how long has the MDEF series of viruses been circulating?  I
would assume that MDEF 'C' is the third version detected...?  What
does it do?  And finally, if the desktop of a floppy has been infected
with this virus, can that desktop be repaired/rebuilt and the floppy
put back into service?

    Thanks in advance for your time.

    Please reply by email - this topic has (most likely) been brought
up before, and I don't want to waste space.  Thanks!

To my knowledge, there are no known mainframe viruses (documented).
Unless you count the VM Xmas EXEC (and others like it) viruses.  I
think these have been classified by most as worms rather than viruses,
because they are stand-alone programs and not parasitic.  Some time
ago (late last year) there was extensive discussion as to the
possibility and feasibility of mainframe viruses.  As a starting
point, you may want to check the Virus-L archives on cert.sei.cmu.edu
for these mainframe discussions.  As for the Cohen paper, that may too
be on the cert archives (if it's available in electronic form--
Ken??).  I think the general consensus then was that viruses were
definitely possible, but not a huge concern given the complexity of
mainframe environments and the different culture associated with
mainframes.

For what it's worth,

[Ed. Sorry,the Cohen papers are not available on our archives; if they
are publicly available electronically, I would be happy to place them
there, though.  If anyone has info on this, please drop me a note.]

I recently installed a floppy disk drive on a non-PC computer
(actually a Radio Shack Color Computer).  I bought the drive without
power supply or cabinet and assembled the unit myself.  I discovered
that the drive would cycle the power on for about 5 seconds every time
a disk was inserted, even when the drive was not connected to a
computer.  It appears to be a feature that makes certain the disk has
seated itself properly before any data operations take place.  As far
as I could tell the computer is not advised of the insertion.  Perhaps
