Subject: Stoned Again (PC)

Hi,

One of our faculty members has been hit twice with this nasty virus.
On both occasions, he had installed F- DRIVERS on the hard disk, the
partition table was gone so he could not reboot from the hard disk. As
a result he had to do a low level format. My question is , how is it
possible that the F-DRIVER did not protect the hard disk?. Although ,
the warning message was given by the DRIVER on both occasions.

We lost everything because of the low-level format, do we have to go
through this each time we get infected or is there a way to recover
the data?

Thanks.

Does anyone have a copy of a shareware program M-DISK, referred to by
the scanv67c.exe program for the IBM-PC?  It is supposed to remove the
boot disk viruses. If you have it online, please send me the UUencoded
version, or the same of another program that can remove boot sector
viruses.  Maybe you have Norton's wipedisk?

I can't seem to get access to simtel20, and I need this in a hurry.

Thanks,

    Agreed.  The problem in the USA isn't the dissassemblies as much as the
viruses themselves.  I am aware of a number of BBS's (esp. here in the CA
area) which provide viruses to anyone who expresses an interest and any
amount of ability.

    Also agreed.  If the past maps of the increase in viruses and
variants are any guide, we can expect to be getting approximately one
new virus every day.  (That is, one new virus or a variant of an old
one.)  Currently, we at McAfee Associates are getting approx. 2 to 3
new strains/viruses a week.  Up from about 1 a week when I started
working here.

     If you are willing to call California, you could get the updates from
either our BBS (McAfee Associates @ (408) 988 4004) or from Patricia's BBS
@ (408) 244-0813.  I'm surprised that it was taken off of Simtel20, however.
You can also Fidonet-FileRequest it from the Excalibur! BBS, but I'm not
sure of the methods for that.

Older BIOS versions will bump if they don't find a disk-drive.  Some
BIOS versions will boot from drive B: Best solution I have found is to
disconnect the disk-drives (pull the data-connector out of the
disk-drive) or modify the CMOS.

Both methods are incompatible with some BIOS versions, so be arware!

A may-be solution is to use an encreption method on the hard-disk for
which the user has to us a password, or modify your BIOS to disable
floppy-disk booting.  These methods are very tricky and only suitable
for people that know what they are doing.

In the PC that is rather difficult. It is possible if you dig into DOS
very deep. This would be incompatible for many DOS versions.  It is a
very good idea however, but the PC doesn't give a signal when a new
disk inserted. Only a changeline-signale if the drive door has been
opened.

I'll pass this suggestion over to the author of TBSCAN.

I need all kind of information about the FLIP VIRUS.  May anybody send
me the SIGNATURE FILE of this particular virus?????  I noticed
yesterday that I had got it and it hasn{t done any damage yet.  The
FLIP virus seems to be a mixed one. I thing it infects the boot sector
and some of the root directory files.  One more thing. It looks
indetectable for most known virus-detector. I{ve tried several thing
with no result.  Any help will be usefull.

>More on MACs than on PCs?

Not at all just a much more efficient virus checking system. Being
able to tell if a disk is inserted and scanning it on insertion
ensures a check of all known viruses. with applications such as Sam it
is possible to update the virus checking system when new viri are
identified. The ability to do this on a PC is much more problematic,
too many potential loopholes. Mac's invariably have more immediate
virus checking procedures set up in public areas because they CAN
All our public Mac labs have automatic scanning for viri on disk
insertion. this is much less trustworthy technique on DOS boxes. :-)

Don't you find DOS a much easier environment to hack than a Mac?
Getting into the Mac toolbox is a much more daunting prospect than
hacking DOS. The Mac openness exists in terms of the user front-end.
The operating system is however far from "open". This in fact is one
of the reasons Mac-bashers give for not liking the Mac. You can
customise your Mac more delightfully with start-up screens alterations
to details in the interface but it is by no means a foregone
conclusion that it is easier to write a virus for the Mac#

Subject: Plastique/Taiwan 3/Anticad 2 (confused!) (PC)

I have a copy of a virus that seems to confuse the various virus
checkers I'm evaluating (and trying to convince my superiors to buy
lots of!!!).

Fridik's F-PROT calls it Plastique
McAffee's SCAN calls it Taiwan 3 (as does AVSEARCH)
Solomon's FINDVIRUS calls it Anticad 2

Now, I know that all these virii are related in some way or another
but I am confused as to whether they are all the same or not. VIRUSSUM
does not help much as it calls Taiwan 3 and Plastique seperate virii.

>From the description I have been given of what this virus does (I'm
too chicken to experiment myself :-), it infects COM/EXE and boot
sectors and at some point plays a tune. It also trashes some data
files. Beyond that I know nothing.

Anyone kind enough to lift the fog of confusion from my eyes?

Just possibly, what you have is the AZUSA (SCAN v75 catches it). It
bombs by "losing" COM1 and LPT1.

AZUSA is a boot sector and partition table infector that is at least
as effective as the STONED and infects both floppies and hard disks.
It takes up 1k of memory from the TOM (CHKDSK "total bytes memory" is
reduced by 1024 bytes - 640k machine will report 654336 instead of
655360). No stealth is involved and it may be recognized by the long
jump (E9 8B) at the start of an infected sector.

[Ed. Make sure that you use v75 since v74B will not find AZUSA.  There
have been a few infections of this new virus in the northeast
recently.  If anyone has a good, freely distributable technical
description of AZUSA, please send it in to this group.]

					Good luck,

SCAN version 72 is supposed to be able to clear the "Aircop"
infection, but this kind of message is often received if there is a
slight variation in the code.  (This would indicate a new "variant" of
this virus.)

Yes, SYS B: should remove the virus.  Hoffman's list indicates that
the viral code itself is restricted to the boot sector, and therefore
replacing the boot sector should eliminate the code.
