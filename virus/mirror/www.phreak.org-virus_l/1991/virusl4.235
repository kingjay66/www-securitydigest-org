VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: Re: Washburn and Ethics

Y. Radai <RADAI@HUJIVMS.BITNET, in V-L #233:

>>In the case of SECURE, I was faced with a similar dilemma.  Ok, what
Washburn did was unethical.  But boycotting Washburn would hardly act
as a deterrent in any similar case since it's highly unlikely that
other authors of anti-viral software would be naive enough to admit to
having written a virus.<<

Kinda depends how that information got out to the public, doesn't it? Perhaps
just the fear of being found out would prevent them from writing more, assuming
a strong reaction to a Wasburn, for example.

>>Therefore the deterrent power of boycotting
software of known virus writers seems to be nil.  I suspect that the
main motive for the demand to boycott Washburn is simply to get re-
venge on him, and such considerations do not particularly interest me.<<

I'm not so sure that such actions were personal in motivation, as much
as an attemp to signal other writers that their actions would not be
tolerated. It stands to reason that anyone who knows enough about
computers to create a virus, does other 'above board' programming. If
word got to such people their paycheck would be affected if word got
out about their 'under board' activity, it stands to reason that less
virus programs would be created.

In the case of Washburn, it would appear to be a situation of him
being the cure for the problem he secretly created, if I read your
statements correctly.  Your position seems, on the surface, to allow
such, regardless of your specific delema.

>>Suppose we are at war<<

I'd bet you couldn't think of any other examples under which virus
release would be ethical. I know I can't.

>> As I said a couple of times, this subject has little to do with the
facts,<<

To the contrary; half of the effort to combat against virus
programming is in the tech area, but only half. The other half, it
seems to me, is in the area of ethics, and how we respond to such
people as create such monsters.

Subject: Untouchable From Fifth Generation Systems (PC)

I recently received an ad for an antivirus program called Untouchable
from Fifth Generation Systems which I have not heard of or seen
before.  Does anyone have any positive or negative experiences with
this program.  We use FPROT and SCAN here for the most part but I am
open to using other programs if they are decent for the $$.  The price
of this one is $149 in the ad.

Thanks so much for any information anyone can provide.

The best way to get rid of something like this is to power down the
PC and then disconnect the CMOS battery for about ten minutes.  After
that, hook the battery back up, reconfigure the CMOS, and you're on
your way.

Good luck.

Subject: Not a virus / Generic Boot virus (PC)

Thanks for the responses to what I thought might have been a virus.

My message in VIRUS-L issue 227 asked if the message "Slyder Says..."
in dBase III might be a virus.

It was NOT a virus.

I was finally able to go to the other campus and determine that someone
had merely added it to the PROMPT command in the CONFIG.DB file.

Now I will know where to tell the lab supervisor to look in the future.

- -----------------------------

I also ran into a floppy that SCANv84 said had a GENERIC BOOT SECTOR VIRUS
I also tried CPAV 1.0, NAV, and F-Prot 2.01. The only thing that said
anything (other than SCAN) was the ANALYZE function in F-PROT 2.01 and
it agreed with scan.

I didn't do anything to the disk after that, but I saved a copy of
the BOOT sector to a file using NORTON 6.01 DISKEDIT. I have that file if
anyone wants it. Just tell me how to transfer it (if that is possible).

What should I have done to the disk? It was some sort of spreadsheet
file disk used in some courses.

Hello
Let me disagree with You. I think if "virus scanner" can realy
desinfect virus in memory it does not matter from where You booted
computer, for example it is very easy to stop activity of 4096 just
replace 3rd call to jmp in virus and it will stop activity, and "virus
scanner" can try to scan any file. Of course if "virus scanner" can
not cure virus in memory it is very dangerous to scan files...

BTW should do users who has no floppy drives ? :-)

Hello Aryeh,
Only one thing You forgot, for example my computer has very interesting key -
"Reset" :-).
I mean that usualy people reboot computer by pressing this key or switching
power on, of course I agree that it is very useful feature, but somethimes it
does not work.

Subject: "Bloomington" Virus (PC)

Having just purchased Norton Anti-Virus, we discovered a strain of the
"Bloomington" virus on a floppy we have.  The strange thing is that we
can't find it on any hard drives we have, just a floppy that we copied
some files onto.

Can anyone tell me more about this "Bloomington" virus?  Any and all
info will be much appreciated, via email perferably.

Thanks in advance.

Subject: Scan for Win3 & Ver. 85 (PC)

  Does the new version of VIRUSCAN (85) work with Scan for Windows?  I
replaced VIRLIST.TXT and SCAN.EXE with the new versions and it seemed
to work.
  Is a new version coming out that supports the new switches?
  What does the B mean in WSCAN84B.ZIP?  Beta?
  Just out of curiosity...

Subject: TBSCAN does odd things on my computer (PC)

I have just tried to use the new TBSCAN virus scanner, v. 3.0 (though
this used to happen with older versions, too). When I try to run it,
using

TBSCAN C:\

it runs through all the files OK, but there are two problems:

1) It tells me it is "SKIPPING" every executable - not too useful

2) My 3 1/2" floppy drive light comes on and the drive makes
a noise during the entire scan.

When I remove all device drivers and TSRs, 2) is cured but 1) is still
a problem. My machine is a PS/2 model 90 (486).

Has anyone else noticed this, or alternatively, how do I send mail to
the fidonet addresses listed in the DOC file?

HALP!

Any idea what virus, if any, displays semi-random multi-colored
reverse-video cells on the pc screen and then locks up the pc?
(semi-random = distribution tends toward the left.)

And if you recognize it, any idea what software might be able to
"heal" the system?

thanks muchly!

The M.Angelo virus infects the Disc Partition Table,the fixed Disc
Boot Sector and it installs itself into memory. This virus also
corrupts the program or overlay files, it affects the system run-time
operation and it directly or indirectly corrupts file linkage.
	On March 6, M.Angelo's birthday, it FORMATS the hard disc of
the infected PC. If you can get your hands on McAfee SCAN, they have
the antidote to remove such a virus.
