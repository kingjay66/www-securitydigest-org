Subject: VIRx on a 3COM network (PC)

I just tried using the VIRx scanning program on network volumes attahed
via 3Com 3+Open.  The scanner reported "Bad status reading partition table"
and stopped for a key press.  The program then presented a message that it
was "Scanning: \\              \DOSAPPS\" and paused.
		 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ <= this space was filled with high order
				   garbage characters.

The command I had issued was:  VIRX D:\

D: is actually \\AGHELAB\DOSAPPS.  The scanner was apparently able to obtain
the last part of the name correctly.  VIRx then reported that it had scanned
0 files and 0 subdirectories.  If I scan a floppy, it works correctly, and if
I scan a directory on D: other than root it appears to work correctly.

The version of VIRx I tried was "Current as of 07/01/91", version 1.6.  SCAN
(McAfee Assoc.) reports that there are 46 directories and 1468 files on the
drive.

Has anyone else encountered problems like this?  Or have any pointers for
correcting it?  (SCAN also reported the drive free of viruses, BTW)

                     Hiding in System Layers

One additional use that viral programs can make of operating
systems is as a source of hiding places.

Anyone who has ever tried to manage accounts on mainframes or
local area networks will recognize that there is a constant
battle between the aspects of security and "user friendliness" in
computer use.  This tension arises from the definition of the two
functions: if a computer is easy to use, it is easy to misuse.
If a password is hard to guess, it is hard to remember.  If
access to information is simple for the owner, it is simple for
the "cracker".

(This axiom often gives rise to two false "corollares".  First,
the reverse; that those systems which are difficult to use must
therefore be more secure; does not hold.  Secondly, many assume
that restricting the availability of information about a system
will make that system secure.  While this strategy will work in
the short term, its effectiveness as protection is limited.
Indeed, it often has the unfortunate side effect of restricting
information to those who should have it, such as systems
managers, while slowing the "attackers" only marginally.)

"User friendly" programs and operating systems tend to hide
information from the user.  There are two reasons for this.  In
order to reduce "clutter", and the amount of information that a
user needs to operate a given system, it is necessary to remove
options, and therefore, to a certain extent, functionality.  A
user friendly system is also more complex in terms of it's own
programming.  In order for the computer to behave "intuitively",
it must be able to provide for the many "counter-intuitive" ways
that people work.  Therefore the most basic levels of a graphical
user interface system tend to be more complex than the
corresponding levels of a command line interface system, and are
hidden from the user by additional intervening layers (which also
tend to add more  complexity.)

The additional layers in an operating system, and the fact that
a great deal of management takes place automatically, without the
user's awareness, is an ideal situation for a viral program.
Since many legitimate and necessary operations and changes are
performed without the user being aware of it, viral operations
can also proceed at a level completely hidden from the user.
Also, because the user is basically unaware of the structure and
operations of the computer, changes to that structure and
operation are difficult to detect.

On the Amiga, there are two types of viruses: boot-block and
executable.  Boot Block viruses are only loaded into RAM when an
infected disk is booted.  Executable viruses are loaded into RAM
whenever an infected file is run.  I suspect that your infected disk
was a system disk, with the program :l/disk-validator on it.  Under
AmigaDOS 1.3 and lower, the system will load and run the disk
validator LOCATED ON THE DISK INSERTED if one is present and the bit
in the root block is set which indicated that the bit-map is invalid
and needs to be rebuilt.  If the disk-validator program is infected
and the disk is in need of validation, AmigaDOS will cheerfully run
the validator WITHOUT ASKING.  Under AmigaDOS 2.0, l:disk-validator is
run (from the system disk), not :l/disk-validator (from the inserted
disk), eliminating this security hole.  BTW, write protecting a disk
with an invalid bit-map prevents the system from updating the bit-map
and will cause the system to be infected all over again when the disk
is inserted.

I have had a program called PC-Lock 1.1 for several years on our BBS.
According to the documentation, it does what you are asking.  The docs
say:

                    THE PC-Lock HARD DISK PROTECTION SYSTEM
                                 Version 1.1
                            (c) Copyright 1986 by

                           Johnson Computer Systems
                              20 Dinwiddie Place
                            Newport News, VA 23602

      WHAT PC-Lock DOES

      After you install PC-Lock you will be asked to enter your password
      each time you boot your computer from your hard disk. Just type
      your password and press return. The boot process will continue
      normally.  If you make an error, just re-type it correctly and
      press return.  When you boot from a diskette the system will boot
      normally, but you will not be able to access your hard disk.

I have not had personal exeprience in using it, so I don't really know
of any weaknesses it might have.  There may even be a more current
version.  However, I would be happy to UUENCODE the ZIP file and mail
it to you.

My best guess is that this is not a virus. Probaly your video controller
is malfunctioning. Try changing it and see what happens.

As I wrote in one of my previous postings, it depends on what do you
understand by "cannot". You probably mean that when DOS boots, it
cannot recognize the disk (says "invalid disk drive" when you try to
switch to that disk). This, of course, does not mean that the disk is
not accessible to BIOS (using INT 13h, not INT 25h/26h). More exactly,
this means that any boot sector virus that is able to infect MBRs
(Master Boot Records - where the partition table resides), will be
able to infect a disk "protected" in this way.

Such protection schemes usually install themselves in the MBR, then
either encrypt the partition table, or move the original MBR to
another place. If a virus attacks such disk, it will just install
itself in the MBR and move the MBR, containing the protection program
to another place. When the computer is booted, the virus receives
control, stays resident in memory, then reads the moved MBR and
transfers control to it. Since the protection program resides there,
it will just ask for the password and so on.

Since all MBR infectors use BIOS to access the disk, there is no
possibility to "hide" the disk from them. It is possible, however, to
disinfect the disk automatically on reboot, but this is another story.

Vesselin

The Liberty virus showed up here in Boston last week at my employer's
Novell network. (My employer is NOT Northeastern University.) The
infection wasn't very bad and we cleaned it up quickly.

I note that there have been several mentions on the net lately that
people have gotten this virus and been unable to remove it with CLEAN,
and were forced to delete the files. We also experienced this problem.
I have mailed a copy to McAffee today for their examination, at the
request of their tech support department. Hopefully this will be
resolved in a future version of CLEAN.

Incidentally, is there a site from which I can FTP the latest version
of Flu Shot? I have an old (very old) copy on a floppy somewhere, but
I'd much rather have the newest version. (Please answer that by
private mail, no need to waste bandwidth.)

Subject: Re: Hard disk locking PC SECURITY (PC)

Most of the small-round-key PC locks can be opened by using a fired
.22 shell like a key (to turn the peg in the lock).

DO NOT trust the keyboard lock to keep people from "playing" with your
machine.

  The only foolproof protection would be to disassemble the machine
and install a REAL lock in place of the factory-installed keyboard
lock, get a TSR that can lock the MOUSE when the keyboard is locked,
and lastly install a lock such that the case cannot be opened without
the appropriate key.

Subject: New Virus ? (PC)

I am having a problem running a program that requires 541K of free
conventional memory (according to the manual).  I get the message
"Program too big to fit in memory", even though I have about 552k of
free conventional memory (according to CHKDSK and some other programs
too).  The peculiar thing is that the program was running a few days
back, under this same configuration.  No change has been made to the
CONFIG.SYS or the AUTOEXEC.BAT files.  There are no TSR's in the
memory other than SHARE (even if there were, the largest free memory
block is larger than required).  The program does run if I get about
580K free.

I have checked the program for infection using F-PROT V1.16, and using
Norton Anti-Virus V2.00.  In both cases the results were negative.
Could this program be infected with a new virus?
Any comments?

Is there any place I could upload this program to have it checked
(can E-Mail be used for sending binary files) ?

	We have a novell network running v3.11 and have (touch wood)

	We thus far have only PC compatibles on our net but soon will

	and a few other questions....

	1)	Do there exist viruses that can infect novell fileservers ?
		(I don't mean .EXEs or .COMs or whatever on the server but
		 the files that it runs like .NLMs etc )

	2)	Is there a way of putting a task on the server that scans for

	3)	Is there some way I can keep the viruses off the executables

We have a Toshiba 1200XE which has been diagnosed as having the
Telephonica Virus in the partition table of the 20MB hard disk. I've
tried repartitioning and reformatting the disk, but it is still
infected. I asked our local Toshiba dealer how to low level reformat
the disk and he said it was an IDE disk and it could only be done with
a special program which dealers have and can't resell. They'll quite
happily do it for us, but it's an hour's drive so I thought I would
enquire here first if there is any alternative solution.
