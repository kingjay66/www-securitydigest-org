First this is a technical problem (solvable) & there are several choices:

1) allow the server script to proceed.
2) call the administrator first (number should be in message) to verify
   what is going on.
3) allow the login to abort and call a tech to perform the installation.
4) provide some means of electronic authentication.
5) forget using the server (spackle).

See, the user has a choice - real viruses won't ask.

However the question is really one of "can you trust the system
administrator to do his/her job properly". The correct answer is "you
gotta trust somebody" and dates back before the first Christmas.

Since the technique is the same as we have been using successfully on
mainframes for years, it does have a good track record (or do you check
the  SYLOGIN.COM each time you login to a VAX ?)

ps there seems to be some confusion about ProgramDisk and DataDisk - on my
   Tandon laptop & office Zenith they are two partitions on a single drive.
   On my home "conglomeration" they are two different drives. It doesn't really
   matter (could be more too e.g. DevelopmentDisk, UnixDisk, etc all with
   different permissions/restrictions).

Yes, put:

	BREAK=OFF

in your config.sys files, preferrably as the first line.

Then, explain to the instructors that they can be held personally
liable for the expense of cleaning up the systems if they make any
further attempts to bypass the virus checking. This behavior is akin
to teaching students that they can cut a hole in a fence rather than
walking a few extra steps to a gate. At the very least, write them a
nasty memo and copy it to their department head.

"Shockwave Rider" is by John Brunner. I have it and "The Adolescence of
P1" at home; I'll check on it. I don't know if I would quite classify
"P1" as a virus; more of a haywire AI project.

"Shockwave" describes the construction and release of worms into a
worldwide network as a common practice, used for everything from
fraud to revenge, and is probably the book Jay is thinking of.

John Brunner wrote "Shockwave Rider" it was published in 1975. He called
them "Tapeworms" as I remember.

It has often been cited as a precursor to the Cyberpunk SF Subgenre.
Actually, now that I think of it, I read an article about the Robert
Morris Internet worm case where the book was mentioned several times.

Subject: Generalized opinion question about Mac/IBM arrangement

Just out of curiosity (and please forgive me if this has already been
discussed, I was off the list for the summer) what does everyone think
the arrangement between Apple and IBM will do to the propogation of
viruses? Will there be more of them, or will new machines be infected
with the same old viruses once they get around to offering their joint
OS (Okay...I realize it'll be some time before we see this, but I'm
being really, really optimistic.)

Subject: DIR II virus and DOS 3.31 (PC)

There was a PC here running COMPAQ DOS 3.31 with 40Mb hard disk in a
single partition C:. It began to "hang" during bootstrap.  During
investigation was found that the PC was infected with DIR II virus.
All affected .EXE and .COM (COMMAND.COM as well) were cross-linked to
the last cluster marked as FFFEH. But there was NO the virus body in
this cluster! The virus body was found in sectors 65535-65536 (hex
FFFFH-10000H) instead. An additional analysis of the DIR II code
revealed that this is a bug in the virus. When the virus forms a
driver request to write its body to disk it uses request headers
formats correct for DOS versions previous to 3.31 and for DOS 4.0+.
BUT COMPAQ DOS 3.31 USES DIFFERENT REQUEST HEADER LAYOUT! This leads
to the virus body being written to sectors 65535-65536 (FFFFH-10000H)
instead of the last cluster. If any file occupies these sectors -
it'll be corrupted.  It is still possible to recover affected files if
these sectors were not overwritten which is possible since the virus
doesn't protect them being sure it resides in the last cluster.  All
DIR II disinfectors are to be changed to detect the above case.

Fred is an intelligent and thought provoking individual who is not
afraid to state his convictions. However, his conclusion is
fallacious.  The wonderful part is that this has lead to what may be a
real-world solution for the large-site, large network problem that is
driving managers up the wall. Read on. Vendors take notes.

I have a real problem with this one since I firmly believe that a
"good-enough" (quantum economics) software anti-viral solution is
not only possible but much less complex than a hardware solution that
does anything more than select which drive to boot from (and several
BIOSes will do this for you - in fact this may be the only "hardware"
needed).

While hardware will work, even a "best case" retrofit would involve
either a new BIOS (standard ones seem to be in the U$70.00 range each)
or a card (maybe as low as U$25.00 but the cheapest I've seen in Computer
Shopper was U$50.00 + a slot) and the real "cost" is likely to be in
the setup. On the other hand, my technology demonstrator, DiskSecure, can
install in less than 30 seconds, works with MFM, RLL, IDE, and SCSI
drives (haven't tried an EDSI drive) and provides for even faster
recovery in case of a misteak.

Also "economys of scale" work much more favorably for software than
hardware: the delta cost of acquisition is essentially zero for a
site or server license.

More importantly, as pointed out with respect to Dr. Fred's contest,
update/installation could even be performed automatically on a network
that would also serve as a repository for the recovery information.

(do I sense a glimmer of what might be a "true solution" for large
networked sites ? - obviously impossible with hardware - might be a
paper in this).

Partly true - it is harder to write a proper master boot record (and requires
some tweaking of MASM) for a PC than to create a file infector using VMS
FORTRAN. Getting permission to infect the file is, of course, another matter.
However, few people have a VAX in their den closet, and, while I actually
wrote a working VMS device driver once, I never want to do it again.

However, even VMS has had more "compatability" changes than MS-DOS: Just a
few years ago, new releases required recompiled code as the run-time
library would change and even more recently uVAX VMS was merged with "real"
VMS so that executables for one would run on the other.

Just to avoid bashing DEC alone, I'll say that EBCDIC is not really encryption.

However the important point of this posting was about a screen and a half
ago (I keep trying to forget JCL). Given proper site licensed software
designed with the network in mind, we are ready for a quantum leap in defense
from malicious software. Everything is here already, it is just a matter
of doing it.

Consider the following: (already mentioned to John and Roger) major anti-viral
software and disk protection software is maintained on server. One stop
updates as new releases occur.

When client logs in server (in login script) authenticates presence of
anti-viral/access control software on client (Tim can tell you that this
works - nothing blue-sky here). If not found, server prompts client for
permission to install software - if refused, connection is terminated.

Next, server checks for client having latest version of software, if not,
client is again prompted for permission to update if necessary. (PRODIGY
(sm) is said to do this without prompting on connection).

Following update, server and client handshake to verify that all systems
are GO & normal login procedures follow.

Would you believe update of 5000 clients in a 1 hour period is possible ?
(Have you seen how fast the Jerusalem can spread in an unprotected system ?)

Would you believe that even in the unlikely case of infection (resident
systems remember), it would be caught almost immediately ?

Would you believe that nasty software would have to subvert the server first
or be caught quickly (and we have trained people whose job is to watch for
that - 1 per thousand PCs is about right) ?

Sure there are RISKS (hello Peter), but technical ones and solutions are
possible.

Think about it.

Well, it does stop viruses in your test, which was running known
viruses (ones not designed with your machine in mind), in a test
situation.  It remains to be seen to what extent it can do it in more
day-to-day practice.  I'd like to see, for instance, a large group of
users somewhere (a department at a typical business or university, or
a PC User Group, say) try out the approach, and see if it was both
livable-with and effective against actual viruses in daily use.  It
might very well be!  I think it'd be a very interesting experiment.  I
was just pointing out that the experiment hasn't been done yet, and
that your test wasn't really proof of anything in particular (any
number of software anti-virus solutions would have passed the same
test, after all).  I'm definitely interested in solving problems on a
day-to-day basis (as well as in the long run).  If your approach turns
out to do that, and yet leave the machine easy enough to use for users
to accept it, that'd be Really Good News!

Yep.  That was really my main point: although they sound very
different, software and hardware have similar vulnerabilities and
tradeoffs.  Either one must be used in a real life setting to see
whether it's cost-effective.  The Test of the Marketplace, if you
will...

Subject: An anti-virus patent

I've just run across an interesting U.S. patent.  It's number
4,975,950, granted to Stephen A. Lentz, entitled "System and Method of
Protecting Integrity of Computer Data and Software".  The filing date
is November 3, 1988.

It basically patents the idea of having a virus-checker get control
before the operating system, and not allowing boot if it finds a
virus.  One sample PC implementation is code in an additional ROM
module (on a "virus protector board") that would get control during
boot (like the hard disk BIOS, the EGA BIOS, and so on), and load and
test "the system files" (not clear if he means the boot records, or
things like IBMBIO, IBMDOS, COMMAND.COM), and not allow boot if a
virus was found (how it tells isn't spelled out).  This is just one
sample implementation; the actual claims are quite broad, and seem to
cover anything that gets control between the "program for controlling
said central processing unit" and the "program for interfacing said
storage memory with said system", by which he presumably means
ROM-like things and operating-system-like things.

Has anyone else seen this patent?  The date (November, 1988) seems
rather late to me.  Is it really the case that no one had published
that idea before then?  (It doesn't count if someone just *used* the
idea, of course; it has to have been published somewhere, if only in
the documentation of something that uses it.)  Gee, we're slow!  *8)

Can anybody out there help me with this problem ?  I have an 486
machine with 2 hard drivers. Yesterday when I used scan80 to check my
system, the program reported the viruse 'form' appeared on my "C"
driver's partition.  I tried to remove the viruse with 'clean', which
came with the scan, but it said it could not remove it.  Then I used
the Norton Utility to check the disk, it reported there is a byte in
either the boot sector or the partition table, I forgot which one, was
set incorrect.  I have some important datas on the disks, and I don't
have the latest backup.  Can anyone tell me what happened to my
disks,and how to clear the viruse without formating the disks ?  In
case I have to format the disks, how do I backup datas from the
drivers without taking the viruse with the datas.

Subject: BGS-9 Amiga file virus (Amiga)

The BGS-9 is a file virus in the Amiga. It's infection routine is as
follows;

1) Open startup-sequence, and find the first executable file.
2) Rename that file to "devs:__________" where _ is character $A0 (number
of them is not necessarily the same as posted here).
3) Copy itself into the place of that executable.

Protection measures:
1) Keep your boot disk write protected. If on a hard drive, use the LOCK
command. This is the best protection measure to take if using new or
suspect software.
2) Run a virus checker (Nic Wilson's NoVirus or Jonathon Potter's ZeroVirus)
every so often.
3) Use one of the BGS protection programs, which create a zero-length
file in the DEVS: directory of the name referred to above so that the
rename fails. NOTE: This may cause some virus checkers to describe your
disk as infected.

I hope that you find this information useful. All followups via

Subject: Hardware defenses

Regarding Fred Waller's pecking order, one often neglected
consideration is that the levels in the pecking order communicate (in
some sense) with each other.  For instance, if protection hardware can
be disabled by the operator, a virus can tell the operator to disable
the protection hardware, and some fraction of the operators will obey.

Subject: scanner for all files (PC)

Recently I corrupted some files on my hard disk, not by a virus
infection but by changing my QEMM setup and crashing while downloading
in the background.  The end result was a few corrupted files with
unchanged time stamps, and maybe a few more such files that I haven't
found yet.  What I would like for future use is a checksumming program
which would look at all files on my hard disk and tell me which ones
have changed without the time stamp changing.  Will any of the
anti-virus programs do this?  The closest I've found is one which only
looks at executable files.

Although personally I don't have any experiences with the Thunderbyte
hardware, my guess is that is is unusable with modern IDE or SCSI
drives, since the hardware is placed between your MFM/RLL controller
and your harddisk.

The idea behind Thunderbyte resembles that of FluShot, with the
exception that instead of in software, the locking of the hard disk is
now done in hardware.

Given the abominable quality of the TBScan software, which stems from
the same company, I personally wouldn't trust the software which
controls their hardware lock.

If you want to protect your ST506-based harddisk, a simple switch in
the write enable logic is far more cheaper and - at least in my
opinion - as effective as the Thunderbyte system.
