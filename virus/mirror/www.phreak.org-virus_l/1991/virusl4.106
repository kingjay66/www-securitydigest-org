They aren't necessarily good test targets.  "Bulk" scanners (like
IBM's), that look through every byte of every file for patterns, will
identify them as infected, but scanners that look at, for instance,
specific areas based on the file's entrypoint will not see them as
infected, even if they work fine on actually-infected files.  I
believe Alan Solomon's Anti-Virus Toolkit (I may have the name wrong)
is of the latter kind, for instance.  So if a scanner doesn't see
those files as infected, it doesn't necessarily mean that it wouldn't
see a normally-infected file as such...

Thanks for all the info...

 "Vaccine (TM) 1.0.1", "KillVirus", and "Kill WDEF - virus INIT" have
been cast into our pit of obsolete & useless programs (with "Ferret"
and "Kill Scores").
  Disinfectant 2.4 and it's init are on all our MACs.
  Sam Intercept is on all of them too.  I hear it requres some sort
of password to remove it.  I've never tried to but I don't think anyone
here remembers what the password is.  I'll have to RTFM (if I can FIND TFM).

The main thing you've discovered here is that scanners only reliably
detect the viruses that they know about.  If you create a new virus
(from scratch, or by modifying an old one), it's very likely that some
scanners will no longer detect it.  No big surprises there!

>First of all, I hope that only good guys are on this list, because the
>remarks made here would otherwise result in hundreds of newly virii.

Almost certainly a false hope; there's no reason to think that no
virus writers are reading this.  On the other hand, I think they
already understand the principle!  One could have wished you'd been a
little less explicitly helpful to them, but I don't it'll hurt, at
least in the long run.

> - what other scanner should I try for these versions ?

Some scanners may be "lucky", and see your home-grown variants as
infected.  IBM's Virus Scanning Product, for instance, will recognize
the first of your monsters as a variant of the 1701.

Yep, deciding whether or not a given program is a virus is definitely
undecidable.  Fred Cohen proved that awhile back.  So if you take some
existing virus, and make some changes to it, the question of whether
or not the result is still a virus is not one that *any* program is
going to get right all the time.  Scanners reliably detect only
*exactly* the viruses they know about, not variants that you (probably
unwisely) choose to create.

Any good modification-detection program will look at the *contents* of
files (not just the length), and tell you what's changed.  Of course,
if you want to be able to trust the result, you have to get the
machine into a known state first (cold-boot from a trusted floppy,
don't run anything from the suspect hard disk).

A virus could certainly do that, but the 1701 doesn't.  Most likely it
infected something in the autoexec, so that the next time you booted,
it got control early, and then infected everything else executed
thereafter (that's how the 1701 works; it infects every com executed
after you run the first infected one).

So, then, you have to install the program on each machine.  Taking
that "snapshot" is a good idea, but still has problems if you use a)a
new seed on each machine and b) store that seed someplace where it can
be seen by "the bad guy".

If someone is going to subvert the code, they're gonna subvert the code
and there's nothing we can do about it.  It's not as if DOS were a real
operating system -- it provides no real protection and simply putting
more and more layers of "feel-good-and-warm-and-fuzzy" dressing on DOS
simply makes a person *feel* better, but provides them with nothing.

If somebody wanted to mcreate a virus that gets around my stuff and the
code of everybody else out there, they probably could.  Targetting my
code is sorta silly: it's too easy to simply go right out to the disk
controller if you really needed to.

Right.  So, if they're targetting my code, no protection will suffice,
if they are not targetting my code, why bother making things more
complex.  Your mileage may, of course, vary.

Well, the efficiency of a package in stopping viral infections has yet
to have any scale to measure it by.  When such a scale exists, all the
vendors will be climbing to the top of that heap, too.

>Right;

First, organizations have been woefully lacking in training of
personnel expected to deal with malicious software (a management
problem). Our technicians get two days of targetted training before
being certified to respond to suspected viruses.

That said, since employees are instructed to power down and quarentine
any PC suspected of having a virus, the first action after questioning
the employee for symptoms is to cold boot from a write-protected
floppy and check the system out in that manner including a "scan" of
the disk and examination of the MBR and DOS Boot Record

Only if that comes up negative is the PC allowed to boot itself. At
this point the system integrity is repeatedly validated using
MEM/DEBUG and CHKDSK to determine if something is trying to go
resident.

At this point, McAfee's SCAN is often used in a different way: the
command "SCAN NUL /M" results in only memory (no files) being checked
for all viruses it knows about. If this fails then file comparisons
are done and the audit trails are checked (all PCs including employees
home machines are authorized to use a site-licensed checksumming
program).

Again a layered approach by trained personnel is necessary to protect
against the sort of global disaster mentioned (incidently, during my
training session at the CSI Conference in Denver, I thoroughly
infected the demo PC with the 4096 only to discover that there was no
5 1/4 boot floppy to use for recovery - Had several 3 1/2s for the
laptop, but no 5 1/4s.  Entertaining.)

BTW the McAfee product .DOCs do mention in several places the
advisability of booting from a known clean, write-protected floppy
first.

>>security whatsoever, because it does not prevent a viral infection.

>True, a checksummer does not prevent infection, but at least it can
>*detect* infections, and that's a lot better than no security at all!!

Depends on the checksummer - the one we use performs the checksum
routine on any program presented for execution. If the program is not
known to the audit trail, a screen warns the user that the program is
unknown.  Depending on the setting, the user may or may not be
permitted to execute the program. I suppose that this really comes
under the heading of access control but should be part of any
integrity management solution.

>... a program which prevents infections through floppy boots (to
>be mentioned soon)...

I believe that VSHIELD protects from hot-boots now - do not believe
that prevention from cold boots can be done without hardware or
special BIOS.  My next project now that DISKSECURE is essentially
complete will be a small addition to warn the user on boot if a floppy
is in the drive - should not be difficult or require much code (trap
cntrl-alt-del, check for floppy, write warning message, loop for
response), several viruses make use of this technique already so it
cannot be too difficult (famous last words).

Subject: How viruses actually spread

>Of course I don't do much with shareware or BBS downloading which is
>where I imagine most of the problems are.

Along with many others, you imagine an untruth.  Both PC and Mac
viruses spread by sharing of machines and diskettes.  They might have
been spread by BBSs but they have not been.  They might have been
spread by shareware, but they have not been.

Regular readers of this forum are aware of this, but it bears
re-stating, particularly in the face of specualtion to the contrary.

The most successful viruses infect boot sectors of diskettes,
partition tables or boot sectors of hard drives, and go resident,
i.e., they are TSRs.  They spread when users permit strange diskettes
to be inserted in their machines, or when they put their diskettes in
machines that they did not themselves boot from a known source.  While
they can and do spread marginally in other ways, this high-risk
behavior accounts for their current success.

Subject: Spanish Virus/Telefonica (PC)

Recently, a virus was discovered at Oxford University, Oxford
(England) and the City Univerity at London (England).  It has been
named, "Spanish Telecom," and also, "Telefonica."

According to information that I have received from the UK, the
virus does not kick in until after the system has been booted up
400 times.

The code reportedly contains the following message:

             "Menos tarifes y mas servivios"

    Which means: "Lower tariffs, more service"

Damage -- When triggered, destroys (overwrites) hard disks.

Detection:

     The virus is in *.COM files and boot sector.

     Pattern:

     Header 1 - 881D 8200 83FB 0074 188F 5500 B2; OFFSET 034H

     Header 2 - 83ED 09BE 2001 03F5 FC86; OFFSET 024H

     Boot Sector -

                8A0E EC00 8E700 0003 F18A 4C02 8A74 03C3;OFFSET 083H

I have not personally examined this virus, however the I have no
reason to doubt the source.

It does not matter - you will get practically the same results.  My
scanner may detect some of those SCAN missed or vice versa, but that
is not important.

What is important is that you cannot expect a scanner to detect a
modified virus. It may work, or it may not, but there is absolutely no
guarantee.  A scanner is designed to detect existing viruses, not new
ones or new variants of older viruses, although some scanners may
detect some new variants of some viruses.

Well, if it looked at something else, it would not be a scanner.... :-)

Don't misunderstand me - there are programs which may look at the 1701
virus, or some of your modified variants, and report something like:

	This program seems to cotain additional code at the end,
	which starts by performing decryption of itself. This is
	typical of a virus.

But, a program like this is not a scanner - it is a generic analysis
tool, unable to identify viruses - it just reports anything
"suspicious".
