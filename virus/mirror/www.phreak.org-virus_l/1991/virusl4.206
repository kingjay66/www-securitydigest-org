VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

   Okay, a friend of mine sent me a copy of an article which claims to
   have been posted to usenet (I assume it was to here).  It dealt with
   one of the earilest documentable computer viruses, written for the
   Apple ][ in 1981-2, at Texas A&M.  This friend of mine would very much
   like to talk to the author of this article, but doesn't have Usenet
   access.

I don't know about that one but I wrote my first virus in 1980
followed by a second one in 1981, for the Apple-][.  The first was
"written" by using the mini-assembler to stick instructions into
"unused" parts of DOS and hooking the "CATALOG" command.  CATALOG
would trigger itself into checking on the disk for a special byte in
the directory and then copying itself onto the disk if necessary.
Formatting a new disk would copy itelsf without any specific action by
the virus code (which, actually used part of the format code to copy
dos and itself) onto the bootable tracks.

I had never heard of viruses before and came up with the concept
myself.  I did hear about research on network worms being done at
Xerox PARC and tried to do something similar for the Apple.

If anyone is interested I can try and dig up some old listings or
code.

Subject: Re: question about viruses (UNIX) (PC)

The only true viruses around for Unix systems are research-oriented.
Cohen has written some, Duff has written a very well-known one, and
many other people have written simple examples to describe them.
However, none of these appear to exist outside isolated research
machines (if they still exist there).

Perhaps the first true virus ever discussed in the literature is the
compiler/login modification that Thompson discussed in his Turing
Award lecture on trust.  Of course, you might actually consider Unix
itself to be a virus if you interpret the term "virus" as broadly as
Cohen is doing these days. :-)

The topic of Unix viruses has come up again and again at conferences
and in mailing lists.  Many people wonder why we haven't seen any "in
the wild."  The general conclusion is that because of the user
community, the usual forms of software sharing, and the possible
motives behind writing viruses, it is extremely unlikely that a virus
would be written for Unix and spread very far.

Any products that *charge money* for scanning for a virus in a Unix
environment (as opposed to a worm or a trojan horse) is a waste of
money.  You might as well have spend money on a program to warn you
when a meteorite is about to strike your computer.

I wish it were.  My experience was that
  * my machine became infected during a rebuild of the hard disk,
  * for a few days I did not know that,
  * each interruption of reading the special format PCTools set of backup
    disks from which I was rebuilding the disk led to that disk becoming

On rumination, now I remember one of the thinks I liked about
Enigma-Logic's Virus-Safe, the ability to install itself either as a
TSR (from autoexec.bat) OR as a device driver (from CONFIG.SYS).

There are some definate advantages to such installation though
"running rings" is not how I would describe it. The obvious one is
that the program goes resident prior to the CLI (COMMAND.COM). Since
COMMAND.COM is the immediate target of several viruses including the
4096 family of "stealth" viruses, such a technique can (and has in my
testing) allowed detection of the virus on boot BEFORE it has a chance
to go resident.

Another advantage is that as Vesselin says you can call a device
driver anything you want (I am partial to a .FLA extension), the OS
will happily load and execute anything following a DEVICE= prefix,
making it difficult for a .COM or .EXE infector to find it.

Consequently, while I still think that beginning protection functions
from the DOS level (either AUTOEXEC or CONFIG) is too late for that
warm and fuzzy feeling. There are some advantages to choosing the
device driver route so long as nothing loaded later takes control away
from you. (Why means of verification from the command line is needed).

My Mac just lost it to nVIR A & B, which seem to have been placed on
my machine due to someone using it to play a game (Strategic
Conquest).  Unfortunately I can't control access to my Mac.  When I
lock my office door my boss worries!

Anyway, I got six files infected by nVIR A, one by nVIR B, and here is
the point my note was about:

My Symantec Anti-Virus program is BROKEN!  Its not infected (according
to Disinfect) but it is reported as "damaged or in an unknown format"

Does nVIR A do this to SAM intentionally?  Or is this coincidence?

First things first: I've not employed by the NCSA, and they've never
paid me a cent.  I have worked with them for the past several years
and been substantially impressed.  Impressed enough that I offerred my
book to them for publication (they accepted).  But as of this time,
I've not been paid a cent.
I believe the reason that the files were numbered as opposed to named,
Vesselin, is that they are trying to avoid the problem that seems to
be cropping up more and more recently: that of different names for the
same virus in different parts of the world.  The NCSA scanner report
uses these numbers and reports what the different scanners decided was
in the infected files.  The results are interesting, to say the least:
different scanners called the same file many different names.
Therefore, I believe (I've not talked to Stang about this recently)
that they are going to hold off putting names on the files at least
until the anti-virus product developers conference next month.  At the
conference, they are going to try to work out some common names among
the vendors and researchers present.
As for the organization of the "collection", I haven't had to deal
with it myself...so you may be quite right about the fact that it is
unwieldy.  I can say, however, that Stang has always been able to pick
out the virus I needed in a matter of seconds.  So, I can only es
infer that it must make sense to someone :).
Finally, you commented on the fact that you feel the people at NCSA do
not have the expertise necessary to reliable and careful testing.
Once again, you may be right.  IMHO, however, the past research
reports they've generated have been quite useful.  Perhaps more useful
to users than to researchers, but users seem to be their target
audience.  As always, comments are welcome...even encouraged! :)

Agreed - actually, the majority of computer viruses only exist as "laboratory
samples" in the hands of researchers - they are not active "in the wild".

In fact, a large percentage of them are not known to have infected any
"real" user at all.  The authors just uploaded them to one of the virus
BBSes or sent samples directly to a member of the anti-virus community.

Sometimes a virus apperars to become extinct - no reports of infections are
received for a long time - two years in the case of "Agiplan", and then
suddenly the virus appears out of nowhere - possibly from somebody's drawer.

Partially correct, but this is for a simple reason - anti-virus programs
are generally not 100% effective if a virus is active when they are run.

This means that it is desireable to run the anti-virus program as early
as possible - and as device drivers are loaded before TSRs this makes
them preferable.  A device-driver virus monitor can prevent an infected
COMMAND.COM from loading - The TSR can only alert you to the fact that
COMMAND.COM has been infected.

However, device drivers have one problem - they may not be effective if
loaded on a networked machine, as the network software may take over the
interrupt functions monitored by the device driver, such as INT 21H, 4BH
(Load and Execute).

A TSR program which can be loaded after the network software does not
have this particular problem.

This is basically the reason my VIRSTOP (2.01) program can both be run as
an EXE file from AUTOEXEC.BAT, or it can be loaded as a decice driver in
CONFIG.SYS.

He he...Writing a virus checker for UNIX is easy...here is one, which will
find all UNIX-viruses that are a real problem at this time:

#include <stdio.h>
main()
{
    printf("Your system is clean.\n");
    exit(0);
}

Seriously, though - they are probably selling something more than a
"virus" checker - probably a program to detect changes to executable files
in general, not just virus infections - or perhaps they have some "worm"
detection there as well....does anybody have some information on the
program ?

Subject: Courses on Viri for teenagers, (General)

Colleagues...

I have just had some time to sift amongst my non-urgent mail to
observe that my reply to the original posting (Courses in virus
techniques...) has caused a bit of a stir. I have a few things to say,
which I hope will avoid an unnecessary flame war.

Firstly, with respect to the potential dangers of such a course, I
concur with Werner Uhrig. The dangers are obvious. I don't agree with
the guns analogy (nor does Kevin Buhr, by the sounds of it).
Nevertheless, I still maintain that it is wrong to condemn such
courses purely on the grounds that they are teaching people about the
very things that so many of us are fighting against. However, when I
think of the audience of such a course (teenagers!)  I worry. In fact,
I am very worried.

Y. Radai rightly states that kids are more interested in being able to
make viri and spread them around than in ethical considerations. Yes,
the suggested audience is an extremely poor choice. I suspect (as I
already indicated) that the advertisement of the availablity of such a
course (as part of another course) was merely to attract as large an
audience as possible.  Probably there was a financial motive behind
this, I can comment no further.

What about Burger's book? Many of us have condemned this book, and I
include myself amongst these numbers. The book makes available the
techniques of virus creation without any supervision whatsoever. (In
this case, the guns analogy isn't too far from the mark.)

So, who should be allowed access to such information? And how should
this dissemination be monitored without there being a sense of
censorship? Well, consider this: the army/navy/... is given weapons
training because the purpose of this training is known. (I omit the
armies of nations intent on unprovoked agression.) Biological viri are
normally placed into the care of persons already prepared for the
responsibilities which accompany this trust.  Therefore, the most
suitable audience for a course on virus creation would be the people
who are already committed to defense against computer viri.
Committment would imply a degree of responsibility. The dangers of the
course are thereby reduced, the benefits enhanced. Censorship is
sidestepped. To obtain the information, one must undergo the training
that would ensure that one behaves responsibly with the information.

The complete course would thereby broaden, to include complete courses
on computer security, law, ethics, ... and finally (after passing
through the earlier stages) techniques and counter-techniques. Would
anybody dispute such a course?

I have given this much thought, spurned on by the various private
messages (some for, some against, some rather bad-mannered). I stick
to my premiss that a course on virus construction should be available,
I have reservations about who should be allowed attend them.

Rotan Hanrahan.

PS. Thanks to all who helped with a recent Novell infection. Also, for
    Y. Radai's information, "apparent reality" via OED'74 means "something
    clearly seen, experienced or understood". Metaphysics? Perhaps :-)

Actually they can jump from computer to computer across the air as well.
With wireless LANs and radio waves and stuff, it wouldn't be too hard

Subject: Infection variations



FUNPIV5.CVP   911030

                     Infection variations

This months columns have dealt with a number of possible ways
that computer viral programs may infect program files.
Unfortunately the overwriters, prependers, appenders and
companions mentioned do not exhaust the possibilities.

(By the way, this week's column is basically courtesy of
Vesselin Bontchev, who did all the research.)

In discussing overwriting viri I mentioned, by concept although
not by name, the Zerohunt virus, which looks for a string of nul
characters of sufficient length to accommodate it.  However,
there is also the Nina virus, which overwrites the beginning of
a file, and the Phoenix family, which overwrites a random
section of a file, both of which append the overwritten part to
the end.  The Number of the Beast/512 virus and 1963 both
overwrite the beginning of the file and then move the contents
of the overwritten section beyond the *physical* end of the file
into a portion of the last cluster the file occupies.  Because
the clusters are always of a fixed size, and because it is very
unusual for a file to exactly match a "multiple of cluster"
size, there is generally some space there which is, essentially,
invisible to the operating system.

In the world of prependers, a similar consideration is used by
the Rat virus.  EXE file headers are always a multiple of 512
bytes, so there is often an unused block of space in the header
itself, which the Rat assumes.  The Suriv 2.01 works a bit
harder: it moves the body of the file and inserts itself between
the header and original file, and then changes the relocation
information in the header.

Then there is the DIR II.  The viral code is written to one
section of the disk ... and then the directory and file
allocation information is altered in such a way that all
programs seem to start in that one section of the disk.  Because
of the convoluted way this virus works, it is possible to "lose"
all the programs on the disk by attempting to "repair" them.

At this point in my seminar, there is an overhead foil marked
"This page intentionally left blank."  The point being that
there are all kinds of subtle variations on the themes covered
here ... and quite a few not so subtle means which will only
become obvious after they have been used.  However, it is
important to note that the most "successful" viri in terms of
numbers of infections are not necessarily the "new models", but
the older and often less sophisticated versions.  On the one
hand, this indicates that novelty is not a "viral survival
