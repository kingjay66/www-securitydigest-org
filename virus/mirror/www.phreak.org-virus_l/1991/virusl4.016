VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: Antiviral product contact list (PC mostly)

The following is a list of antiviral product vendors, mostly for the
PC line.  I am sending it out in conjunction with the reviews that I
am doing.  I have two purposes in sending it out:
     1) providing a list of vendors and products, and
     2) hoping to update my own list.
The first list I sent out, Ken immediately sent back a correction.
This list is, I know full of errors.  I would appreciate feedback on
any errors or ommissions, and will, at some future time, send out an
update.  Maybe regularly.

A note regarding the number of "product not available" notations.  I
have, so far, heard nothing from these people.  I do not yet know
whether this is due to improper addressing, poor mail service or
products or comapnies that no longer exist.

I have, also, listed specific names with various companies.  These
names are not, in most cases, the people to contact for ordering the
product.  In some cases they are people I have spoken with, in other
cases they are names I was given to try to contact if the company was
no longer listed.

Please excuse the "informality" of this list.  It represents only
"working notes" in the preparation of the anti-viral product reviews.
I hope it may be helpful to those looking for products.  If you make
an antiviral product, wish to have it reviewed and your company or
product is not listed, or appears erroneously, please contact me.

General Description:

SCAN is a boot sector, memory and file scanning program, with some
disinfection capabilities.  CLEAN is a disinfection program.  VSHIELD
and SENTRY are resident file infection and activity checking programs.

The programs are widely available on electronic bulletin board systems
in the U. S. and Canada, at varying version levels.  They are widely
used, and supported by third party "front ends", utilities and menuing
systems.  The programs are updated regularly, and are supported by the
"Homebase" BBS run by McAfee associates.


                  Comparison of features and specifications



User Friendliness

Installation

SCAN and CLEAN do not require installation as such.  All programs,
however, are distributed in .ZIP format and, beginning with version 72,
require PKUNZIP version 1.10 for unpacking with authenticity
verification.

VSHIELD is distributed in two, mutually exclusive, versions.  Both
versions require the use of SCAN's /AV option, which adds an
authentication CRC check onto programs.  A second level of protection is
added in one version with file infection checking for known viri.  (Note
that the /AV code must be added to all programs before installation of
VSHIELD for it to be effective, and that this will cause programs, such
as Word Perfect, which contain their own "change detection" programming,
to fail.)  VSHIELD must be installed "manually" by the user in the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file with all desired options and switches.

SENTRY is a change detection program which examines boot sectors, system
software and even memory structure.  It is distributed as an
installation program, but as any change to the system (including
software updates) will cause alarm warnings, it must be re-installed
upon each change.

Ease of use

The SCAN program is fairly simple to execute, but provides for a very
large number of options in the form of software "switches".  These can
complicate the use of the program, but probably will not be used by most
users.  The base scanning function is simple to operate, and novice
users will probably not use any other functions.  (The one major
exception is the /AV option.  If used on a program that is already "self
checking" it will likely cause the program to terminate, and so must be
identified and removed.)

Use of CLEAN or VSHIELD is complicated by the fact that SCAN must be a
part of the process, but again the basic operation is straightforward.

Help systems

If SCAN is invoked with no specifications, it gives three examples of
use.  There is no "online" listing for the software "switches" for the
various programs.


Compatibility

SCAN and the other programs in the suite are updated regularly, and the
latest version should be able to handle almost all viri that a user
would encounter.  The addition of the external file option in version 71
is also a major increase in utility.

Company Stability

John McAfee has been producing versions of SCAN for a number of years,
updating on a very regular basis.  SCAN is probably the most widely used
virus scanner in North America at present.

Recent versions have been subject to a number of "bug fix" releases.

Company Support

McAfee Associates lists their address and phone number in all
documentation, and support the Homebase BBS.

Documentation

The directions for use of the programs are clear in all cases, if
somewhat concise.  However, novice users will find little conceptual
information about viri, or specific information about the various viri
that SCAN will deal with.

The documentation, while not quite alarmist, certainly strongly suggests
that the user, if any virus is ever found, should "retain" the services
of McAfee Associates.  Also, outside sources (such as the Hoffman virus
list) often state that viri can be dealt with by, for example, using the
"SCAN /D" option, without warning that this merely deletes and
overwrites the existing file.


Hardware Requirements

No special hardware is required.  The SCAN program itself will not work
with local area networks, but a NETSCAN program is available (again as a
separate package which must be separately obtained.)

Performance

For boot, memory and file scanning only, SCAN is measurably faster than
FPROT, although not anywhere as fast as VPCSCAN.  SCAN did miss some
viri in testing, but the only viri missed were all, in some way,
crippled.

SCAN does not have the range of functions of FPROT.  In addition, FPROT
consistently offered superior "disinfection" capabilities.  Versions of
CLEAN tested (and the earlier MDISK) have, in my own experience,
occasionally left the computer or disk in a worse state than the virus.

Local Support

Because of the very wide use, local support of SCAN is more generally
available.  The available version, however, is not always the latest, as
many users, in my experience, tend to use the one version they obtain
for at least a year before seeking another.

There are also a number of shareware products that "enhance" the use of
SCAN, such as menuing "front ends" or programs to assist in checking
archived files.

Support Requirements

If at all possible, it would be best if knowledgeable users assisted
with the use of SCAN.  The programs are simple enough to be operated by
a novice user, and no harm should result, but best results will be
obtained with the program if someone aware and informed of virus
operation is involved.


                                 General Notes

SCAN is a very useful virus scanning program, and John McAfee is to be
commended for keeping it updated over the years.  It has undoubtedly
saved, without exaggeration, many millions of dollars in lost computer
services.  That said, one is still left with the impression that the
program, as a program, could benefit from more attention to function,
and less to the promotion of the services of McAfee Associates.  The
breaking of the program into different packages for distribution
increases the difficulty in installation and use, and seems only to
serve to hide the true cost of the program, which is very high for
shareware.
