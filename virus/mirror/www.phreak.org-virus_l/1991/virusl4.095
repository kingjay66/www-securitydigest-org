Subject: New virus that halts system after 3000 keystrokes (PC)

Hi here is the preliminary analysis of a new virus (out in the wild)

Name of Virus
	V08-15
Alias
	none sofar (I hope that stays that way)
Virus family
	(to be done)
First occurrence
	May 1991 probably around since 1990
Site of first occurrence
	Germany
Type of virus
	COM and EXE infector, memory resident
Length of virus
	1322..1337 (virus is placed on even paragraphs)
Operating system
	MS-DOS
Version of OS
	3.* and above
Computers
	IBM and compatibles
Direct detection
	Answers upon a INT 21 AX=FFFE with AX=0815 if resident
	Infected files contain the readable string:
	'CRITICAL ERROR 08/15: TOO MANY FINGERS ON KEYBOARD ERROR.'
	EXE-type files are marked infected by 4D54h at offset 12h
	(that is the EXE header checksum).
	COM-type files are marked by the same 16bit value but at
	offset 3 in file (that is 103h when loaded).
Infection mechanism
	The resident virus intercepts INT 21 and infects anything
	loaded and executed, provided there is enough space on the
	drive and file is not too big for COM-type files
Infection targets
	Any executabel code with and without EXE-header
Interrupts
	INT 09 (only if triggered)
	INT 21
	INT 24 (only during infection)
Payload
	After the 11th of November 1990 the virus will intercept INT 09
	and count the keystrokes. If the number of keystrokes reaches
	3000 the virus will display the message above and halt the system.
	Counting starts as soon as the first infected file is started.
Special clues
	The number 08/15 refers to the standard rifle used by the Germans
	in World War II. Today this number is synonymous for the term
	'standard' of 'plain vanilla'.
	The 11th of November is the begin of the carneval season.
Detection
	This is brand new, so use the above mentioned properties
	till the scanners are updated.
Removal
	Boot from a clean disk and delete or replace infected files

Well some form of integrity checking must go resident, even if it is
just smart enough to call the checksum program. Otherwise, what is
going to identify that a program is new or changed. (you could handle
"changed" with a zillion little .BAT files but new ?) Since you do not
want to add to the pilot's workload, it must be automatic therefore
resident.

Further, in order to handle the undocumented DOS "features" and
Windows/Novell /etc interactions, it needs to go resident (at least
the disk handler) before DOS loads e.g. from the BIOS.

Considering performance, while it would be possible to call the main
routine from disk (most good anti-viral routines now permit code
swapping for systems with limited free DOS RAM), it is better to keep
the necessary elements available. Since new memory systems (DR-DOS,
MS-DOS 5.0, QEMM) can provide up to 637k free with 121k of TSRs loaded
"high" on my home machine, in the future, 10-20k of integrity
management should not be a problem (incidently, the 19k check-summing
routine I use is in high memory so on my PC the only loss to DOS is 1k
of the BIOS-level stuff: have 636k of free RAM under 640k).  The delay
in checking each program/disk access is unnoticable to the user.
(Norton reports SI 27.1 / DI 9.1 on a non-cached 25 mhz 386,
ST-251-1/SMARTDRV combo)

Point is, anyone who says the above can't be done is nuts.

Interesting: when you eliminate the older versions of the products,
you are actually left with 10 programs and all appear to be scanners,
not validation programs (Enigma-Logic's Virus-Safe, McAfee's VSHIELD
,etc. were not included) so it is difficult to tell just what they are
evaluating.

Just to provide "apples vs apples" tests, possibly in conjunction with
the public domain viral list, we should make a stab at a weighted test
(e.g. Jerusalem 1000 pts for detection, Pentagon 1 pt.) if we can come
up with a probability function for infection it would certainly be
better than "We can detect 900 viruses". We can start with David's
list, flesh it out a bit, and apply a bit of Quattro's "What If"
(there goes some more negative free time - what we need is a national
laboratory).

Ross: we seem to be cross communicating. In our shop we do not use "pre-
      installed" copies, no two machines are alike anyway & we are running
      everything from DOS 2.0 up. On installation, the package we use takes
      3-5 minutes to take a "snapshot" of the PC and record every executable
      on it during installation.

Only if the "bad guy" knows where it is stored and if the offsets are
the same on every machine - one of the drawbacks to
"pre-installation". If you cannot ensure the physical integrity of the
machine all bets are off. It would take a complex and specifically
targetted piece of software to be able to determin that you were there
(and not some other routine) and bypass it - not for an amateur. One
of the problems is that at present there is a single criteria for
judging PC protection programs: the number of viruses it detects.  In
actuality, this is one of the lesser threats that a full package
should take care of.

a) RACF is the only product that I have seen that will tell a user where its
   holes are (LISTDSD command).

b) I am but authentication of the system/programs, not of the user.

c) Thats what I said - see multilayer "model" of a few months ago.

The points made should still be targets, possible but not necessarily easy.

The Toshiba T1000, and the Zenith MinisPort laptops as well as some
Tandy desktop machines have ROMdisks with MS-DOS 2.x or 3.x.  This
technology has been around for some time, since at least 1987.  All it
really is, is a RAMdisk with a write protect tab :-).

MS-DOS running in ROM hasn't been around so long.  It takes special
effort to get a program to run in memory that is not writable.  As far
as I know, the only machines that run MS-DOS in ROM are the HP-95LX
palmtop running MS-DOS 3.22 (just announced last month) and possibly
the Poquet PC.  The Atari Portfolio palmtop runs DIP-DOS in ROM, which
is MS-DOS compatible.

Network bootable network adapters used in diskless workstations and
elsewhere are more likely to just load the operating system off a file
server rather than actually hold the entire OS in ROM.

Given a virus infected file which had been deleted "normally" (i.e. in
MS-DOS the file is still there but the directory listing is removed)
it is possible for the infective/viral code to appear in this
purported file.  (Shall we call it, say, STAGE.DAT?)

My understanding is that the information contained in our theoretical
file is data, and that it is "viewed" rather than being "run".  If,
however, the system used a "resource" type system (such as the Mac
does), it may be possible for portions of the file to be "run", and
then the danger of reinfection is possible.

Given the very large size of our theoretical file, one can note that
very little, if any, of it could be transmitted during the time the
"send data" LED is on.  The risk of the information being transmitted
to the central service and redistributed is therefore extremely
remote.  It would take a prodigious effort to infect users this way,
but it is not outside the bounds of possibility.

There is *always* argument over terms in the computer virus field.

However, I think that most researchers would agree that "stealth" viri
are those which "trap" any reading of the disk, and hide themselves by
ensuring that the information given back to the screen (or calling
program) is only that of the original program, before infection.  This
means that stealth viri, while active, can avoid any kind of detection
mechanism that relies on reading the disk, such as file signature
checking, file size checking, checksum, CRC or other "image signature"
calculation and checking.

Generally, stelath viri can be detected by examination of system memory.
Exactly how, or the best way to do this, would be the subject of great
debate.  (Which I am not going to precipitate.)

Subject: Spinrite II (PC)

Several people have sent me mail asking what Spinrite II is, and what
does it do, so here's some info (some from the manual, some of it my
own words).

Spinrite II is an MS-DOS based hard drive maintenance utility that
(among other things) non-destructively low-level formats your hard
drive.  From page 1 of the manual:

"SpinRite reads and repairs damaged, unreadable, and uncorrectable
data, spots and removes soft and correctable errors long before the
become problems, certifies fundamental drive/controller data
compatibility, determines and resets a hard disk's sector interleave
for maximum data throughput, performs the most thorugh surface defect
detection, analysis, and data relocation ever, and renews and restores
the low-level format on hard disk drives.

"Best of all, it does all this without disturbing any of the data that
is already on the drive.."

My opinion: best utility you can buy.  Should be available at most
computer stores.  Price would probably be around US$65 - 75.

It fixed 3 errors on my hard drive that the manufacturer found, but
found 2 others and locked them out.  Be warned though, the deepest
testing level does read/write testing 84 times on each sector of the
disk - it took about 21 hours for my 32meg HD.  It also adjusted the
interleave, and increased the speed by about 5 times!

It (claims) to work with any MFM,RLL, or ERLL drive, requires DOS 2.1
or later, and works with Compaq DOS 3.31, MS-DOS 4.0, and many
third-party disk partitioning device drivers (such as OnTrack's Disk
Manager.)

(sorry about the verbosity, a lot of it comes directly from the manual
and package).  (Disclaimer: I have absolutely nothing to do with
Gibson Research, I just like the product.)

The problem might simply be thermal expansion of the platter in the
drive.  As the drive warms up, the platter expands, and the heads are
now mis-aligned.  I had the same problem with my Miniscribe 8438.  A
very simple cure: I never turn my computer off! Well, except for
thunderstorms...  If you have to turn the computer off, then boot from
a (clean, of course!) floppy, and wait for the computer to warm up
before using the hard drive.

Suggestion: Buy a copy of Spinrite II and use it regularly. Best $80 I
ever spent. (I am in no way affiliated with Gibson Research, just a
satisfied customer)

They don't cater for this scenario:-

1. Somehow infect the RAM of your PC with a COM/EXE targetting
   virus, such as Plastique (eg run an infected program from a
   floppy, or from a network).

2. Run SCAN on your hard disk - this does a DOS open on all COM/EXE
   files on your hard disk, and thus infects each and every such
   file _after_ SCAN has pronounced them virus-free

3. You end up with every COM/EXE file on your disk having to be
   reloaded, but you believe otherwise until you find out the
   bitter truth

4. You treat checksum checking programs with utter disgust, because
   they fooled you into believing that you had protection.

Don't say that is cannot happen, it DID.

No - simply because I was not aware of it until recently - it seems
that if F-DRIVER is loaded into high memory, it may miss some boot
sector viruses on bootup, although it will detect all program viruses.
This has been fixed in 1.16 - due in a few days.....
