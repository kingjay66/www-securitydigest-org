Given your reference to SCAN and FPROT, I assume you are working with 
MS-DOS.  The answer to your question is slightly different for the Mac 
world.

If you simply put a disk in the B: drive and give the format command, 
ther is no danger that a boot sector virus (or any other kind) will 
transfer from the floppy disk to your system.

If you are already infected, you will, of course, infect the disk.

If you put the floppy in drive A:, and accidentally reboot the computer, 
you may infect your system.

To more directly answer your question, yes, a demagnetizer will give you  
slightly more safety, but making it policy to reformat these disks in 
drive B: will give you almost as much.

Several response cames in to my brief outline of the anti-viral
software review that appears in the July 1991 issue of PC Plus (UK)
magazine.

The article outlines what viruses are with an excellent glossary of
terms, where they come from and what they do. Next it has individual
reviews of 10 software packages with a "star" security rating.

Couldn't agree more. Mark Hamilton in his review says "I have built up
quite a large library of viruses collected from various sources around
the world". Unfortunately he doesn't specify how many/ what type/ which
viruses he used. Maybe it was lack of space or an oversight?

He then goes on to specify...

He outlines 3 points which I generally agree with:
(i) Detection is more important than speed. 95% detection is OK.
	90-95% is average. Anything else is unacceptable.
(ii) Speed is important as a secondary issue. i.e. the less time it
	takes, the more inclined you will be to run it often.
(iii) Disinfection capabilities. These are not tested in the review.
	I would agree that 90% of the problem is finding out
	you do have a problem.

None of these connections are mentioned but, to be fair, none of the
companies are overtly pushed, let alone mentioned, outside any
qualitative judgements on individual packages. It would be nice for
Mark H. to have balanced these judgements with the facts Dr. S. mentioned.

By the way, I'm just someone who has to fight viruses. I have no
financial connections with any software company nor do I write
anti-viral programs.

What is so refreshing about this review is that it is technically
competent and expressed in language that could help to dismiss the
myths surrounding viruses. To be able to write such a piece requires
an "industry expert" which then brings in that individual's spin.
So IHMO the problems above cannot be avoided in a knowledgable piece.

The selection process of which packages to choose for review is also
omitted. Overall I liked the feature but the omissions above could be
construed as tarnishing its integrity. Personally I don't think so.

An idea of a program which knows all BIOS'es versions frightens if you
think about a vast army of PC clones.  I can suggest the following way
of looking for true INT 13 address at run-time (stealth technique to
hide from it can be invented too, surely):

Scanner sets INT 01 ( single-step ) on itself and calls some function of
INT 13, setting TF simultaneously. A handler of interrupt 01 traces the
addresses through which the execution passes( until it returns to the
scanner ). It is sure that BIOS INT 13 handler resides somewhere between
segment adresses 0C000h and 0FFFFh. As soon as the execution gets into
this region, a scanner stores current address and later use it as an entry
point of INT 13 handler.

Nice, isn't it?

Subject: multi-compression

From:    dave@tygra.Michigan.COM (David Conrad) in #125:

It may be worthwhile to note that after the first, subsequent compressions
tend to yield much diminished returns unless the later compressors are far
more efficient than the earlier ones.  So I think it is unlikely that one
would see multiply compressed files.

For example, say I have an executable, P.EXE, which is 100k in size.
I use LZEXE to produce, say, PLZ.EXE, which is, say, 70k (which is not
unreasonable, I think).  If I were to then try PKLITE and produce
PLZLITE.EXE which might be 67k, would I bother with the extra loading
time for such a small gain?  Probably not.

- -=-=-=
What you suggest isn't very practical, and is nigh on impossible because of the
following:

Let's say I have an EXE that I've run through LZEXE. PKLITE, regardless of
version will do a test on the file to see if the file is smaller after the
compression is added. Since the file's already compressed, PK won't make the
file any smaller, and will crash off, and inform the user that it can't
compress the file.... leaving the file untouched.

Same goes for the other  way around. For this reason, multiple compressed files
are not as large a concern in reality as it appears to be .

Could such files be generated? Certainly, but not without substantial mods to
either LZEXE or to PKLITE, or both... and as I've indicated in the past, I
doubt the virus idiots have that much on the ball, for the most part, that
they'd be able to pull such a thing off.


- -=-=-=
Of course, it's possible that someone might compress many executables in
a batch, and not notice, or perhaps compress as a policy, and not care.
- -=-=-

Again, no. Both LZEXE and PKLITE won't touch the file in question, beyond an
attempt to compress the file in RAM.... upon finding out they've been
compressed, they'll quit without writing the newly compressed file.

E

The IBM VSTOP anti-virus program is currently IBM Internal Use Only
which means that it can be only used by IBM employees. For that reason
it is "little known" (as you mentioned). You are correct in saying
that it detects viruses in compressed files by detecting the viruses
as they are activated. On the other hand it IS fully supported and
updated versions are obtained easily by IBM employees.
VSTOP and other such tools are IBM Internal Use Only and the product
version of VIRSCAN (version 2.1.2) is the only IBM anti-virus product
available right now to the public. IBM is always checking new
possibilities of what it can do to help in this area.

   Just for the record, the term "virus" (as we use it) was *not* coined
   by Fred Cohen.  Cohen's use of it came from his advisor, Len Adleman
   (the "A" of the well-known "RSA" cryptosystem).

     Btw, Adleman has published a very formal treatment of viruses, full
   of esoteric Goedelian concepts like "partial recursive" functions (not
   to be confused with recursive calls in programming) and Goedel number-
   ing.  Although I studied these things in Logic courses in my undergrad
   days, I've never had the time or patience to wade through Adleman's
   article, but if anyone's interested, the reference is:
	 L. M. Adleman, "An Abstract Theory of Computer Viruses",
	 Crypto 88, pp. 354-374.

With a date of 1984 I think the term must have been in use before
that.  I know that I was writing viruses in 1980 and using the term
virus to describe it.  The "official" title was a 'worm', an error
that is the reverse of the current abuses of the word virus.  I got my
idea for a virus for PCs after reading an article about research at
PARC on a network 'worm'.  I tried to write a similar program on an
Apple ][ and succeeded in creating what we now call a virus.

I remember in discussions that the term "virus" came up in describing it
and talking of "infections".  We even developed a "vaccine" that would
protect against future infections.

And all this right out of high school and in my freshman year of
college in 1980.

Pricing depends on many factors such as the type of usage, number of

Subject: Reply to Virus Bulletin (sorry for the length!)

In a letter in the July 1990 Virus Bulletin, Roger Riordan complains
that by stressing raw numbers of viruses detected, VB's reviews are
not properly presenting the real benefits of some anti-virus programs.

In a long reply to that letter, VB makes the following rather odd
claims:
  - That there is a "selectivity" movement in the current anti-virus
    community, that advocates not scanning for viruses not known to
    be in the wild, or thought to be extinct,
  - That the movement was started by me and Ross Greenberg in a couple
    of VIRUS-L postings in May,
  - That the movement is motivated by a desire to cut costs by avoiding
    work, and to keep scanners with primitive scanning techniques from
    being slowed down by too many viruses,
  - That in the long run the most good will be done by those companies
    that resist this nefarious movement, and spend all their time gathering
    as many viruses as they can, and developing scanning techniques which
    will not be slowed down by having more viruses added,
  - That every functioning virus is "a threat", and no-one can say otherwise.

I may of course have mis-represented some of the points in this summary;
I hope not!   The piece is not signed, and is therefore presumably by
Edward Wilding, of whom I would generally expect better.   My reply to
it is attached; it will also be FAXed to VB, in hopes of being included
in a forthcoming issue.

Dear Editor,

I am writing to try to clear up a rather surprising confusion
that I have evidently caused.  In a reply to a letter in the
July 1991 VB, the editor reprints (without permission) a posting
of mine to VIRUS-L, and attributes to me by implication the
opinion that, among other things, virus scanners should not scan
for viruses not known to be in the wild, or thought to be
extinct.  I would like to state that that is not my opinion, and
that I did not intend to give that impression in my posting
(which, in fact, consists mostly of questions, not of statements
or opinions).  The fact that the IBM Anti-Virus Product, with
which I have something to do, scans for at least as many
"research" or "collector only" viruses as known-in-the-wild
viruses should serve as evidence to the contrary.  In fact, I
doubt that any of the other anti-virus workers who have taken
part in the discussion would agree to the theory of "selectivity"
as the Editor states it.

On the other hand, I would like to take this opportunity to
outline a view that I *would* support, which I hope is
sufficiently far from the naive "selectivity" view to avoid
further confusion.  As the anti-virus field continues to move
past the butterfly-collector stage and into a more mature and
responsible part of its life, anti-virus workers will quite
naturally move beyond the simple questions of how many viruses
they can find, and the details of what a specific virus does.  To
be of the maximum service to our customers and the community, we
have to say more than "we know of these 400 viruses, and only if
you buy our product can you be saved; the Snorfler virus, for
instance, will erase all your data on alternate Thursdays".
We must also be able to give some idea of which viruses are in
fact the most serious threat, which are likely to become threats
in the future, and what anti-virus measures are likely to be
the most effective (after all, any reader of VB knows how to
protect a single machine against all the most common viruses; the
difficulty now seems to be to figure out how to protect an entire
community or organization).

In order to do accurate threat-estimation, and research into how
viruses behave at the organizational or societal level, we need
to know new kinds of things about viruses.   We need to know what
software sharing patterns are like, what causes some viruses to
be common and others not, and which viruses are in fact common in
the real world today.   It is toward the answers to these sorts
of questions that our most interesting current work is focused,
and it was in an attempt to attack some of those sorts of
questions that I made my posting to VIRUS-L.  I think we in the
anti-virus community *do* need to be selective, but not by simply
ignoring viruses that are not in the wild.   We need to be
selective, instead, about where we concentrate our research, and
be sure that we don't ignore the important large-scale questions
because we are using all of our resources on just gathering all
the viruses we can find.

It's perfectly acceptable, and accepted, for an anti-virus worker
today to say to the press "there are over six hundred viruses in
the world", for a software maker to advertise a product primarily
on the number of viruses it detects, and for a publication to
rate products primarily on that number.  In the future, though, I
would hope that a responsible researcher would at least add
"although only about 10% of them are actual threats", that a
responsible software maker would at least say "including the 10%
known to be in active circulation", and that a responsible
publication would give the reader some idea of how a product
performed against the most important subset of their very
complete test set.  Similarly, it would be very nice if
collectors exchanging viruses with trusted peers would also
exchange anything they know about the history or current status
of the viruses involved, and not simply binary samples.  I trust
that as the industry continues to mature, all these good things
will happen.

One statement in the Editor's reply with which I would definitely
disagree: he states in the caption to the excerpts from VIRUS-L
that "no functioning virus can be classified as a 'non-threat'."
That is not the case: anyone with much experience in the
anti-virus field can say with confidence that, for instance, the
MGTU virus, while it is technically a functioning virus, will
never become any more widespread than a non-viral "arf-arf" style
Trojan Horse would; the virus is just too slow-spreading and too
obvious.   To claim that we can always tell which viruses are the
dangerous ones would of course be foolish; but to claim that we
have no idea, and that all viruses must be treated the same way
because they are all threats, would be equally inadvisable, and
I'm sure that the Editor did not mean to make that claim.

Thanks for the chance to clear this up!

DEFGEN3.CVP   910714
 
                   Specialty viral programs
 
If we stick to a strictly "Cohenesque" definition of viral
programs as only those which attach to specific programs, then
there are some difficulties with defining other, similar,
programs which reproduce themselves, but without being linked to
a specific program.
 
Unfortunately, although attempts have been made to address this
issue, there is, as yet, little agreement as to the terminology.
 
In early multitasking operating systems, programs often "broke
the bounds", and would overwrite sections of other programs or
data.  Since this damage was generally random, the pattern of
damage, when mapped, gave the appearance of twisting tracks
which appeared and disappeared.  This closely resembled the
patterns seen when cutting through a piece of worm eaten wood,
giving rise to the term "worm" for such rogue prgrams.  One
such program escaped not only from its own partition within the
computer, but actually escaped from the orginal computer to
another over an early computer networking system.  The term
"worm" has therefore come to be used to refer to viral programs
which do not attach to specific programs, and, more
specifically, to those which use network communications as a
vehicle for spreading and reproduction.
 
Two examples of this usage are the famous Morris/Internet/UNIX
worm of late 1988, and the lesser known CHRISTMA EXEC mail worm
of December 1987.
 
This still leaves a class of viral programs which do not attach
specifically to programs.  There are actually many sub-groupings
within this group, and there are within viral programs
generally.  However, European researchers, particularly those
from France, often refer to such programs as "bacteria", rather
than viri.
 
In these areas of terminology there is often much debate about
whether a given virus, or type of viral program, fits into a
given class.  Boot sector infectors, for example, would not
appear to fit the definition of a virus as infecting another
program, since BSI's can be spread by disks which do not contain
any program files.  However, the boot sector of a normal disk,
whether or not it is a "system" or bootable disk, always does
contain a program (even if it only states that the disk is not
bootable), and so it can be said that a SI is a "true virus.
