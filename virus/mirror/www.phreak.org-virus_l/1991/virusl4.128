Re: Inaccuracies in Press on Viruses

VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Ah, but what if you first use a compression program which is not as
good as LZEXE or PKLITE.  Try for example to compress a program with
EXEPACK - PKLITE is oftem able to compress them still further...

I am a little disappointed at such a narrow and egocentric view.
The offering of the virus for sale increases, rather than decreases,
the possibility that one will "sneak up on you some night."  Getting one
in the mail when you expect it, does not reduce, but increases, the
chance that you will get one when you do not expect it.

You reason like the man who when told the chances of a two bombs on a
plane was vanishingly small, decided to always carry his own.

Seeing the content of Jerusalem-B will tell you nothing that is not
already public.  There are no clever secrets in Jerusalem-B, and nothing
that you can learn about it from having your own copy that will reduce
your vulnerability to it.  The ability to satisfy your morbid curiosity,
at the expense of giving it a boost which it does not need, seems to me
a very bad trade indeed.

Your vulnerability is related to the total number of copies in the
world; someone offering it for sale can only influence that in one
direction.  What makes you think that all of the purchasers will treat
it with the respect with which such a dangerous artifact should be
treated?

One way to view the ethics of something that you would like to do is to ask
yourself how you would be affected if everyone else did it too.

Hi Ross.. Last time I looked, the prices were very clearly listed in
the .DOC files for SCAN and the other utilities... Says right there
what it costs. Also says that if you need any other information or a
quote for a site license to give 'em a call too.

Robert McClennon wrote on the Washington Post article which discussed
the possibility of a virus in the telephone software.  He was
disturbed (and rightly so) that the press does not use the jargon
correctly when describing such problems.

Fortunately (or maybe not so fortunately since we are dealing with a
certain amount of potential incompetence) the problem was not virus,
trojan, or worm related.  It was just bad programming.  The story was
updated on NPR late last week, I believe.

Subject: Philosophy, comments & Re: long and technical (PC)

	First, the number of column inches devoted to one vendor
yammering about another's failure to publish (in Virus-L !) a price
list is getting out of hand. This kind of diatribe serves no
constructive purpose in this forum.

	In the same vein, I have learned that to a journalist,
credibility is everything & once lost is very difficult to regain.
Quoting recognized experts out of context and distorting papers to fit
maligning prose is a quick way to ruin credibility so that even
valuable contributions are distrusted.

	Combining the two paragraphs above, I have decided that any
response to such merely allows opportunity for more yammering or yet
another distorted response & thus personally decline to do so. "Once
bitten" & all that.

	Back to the main subject, the responses and suggestions seen
so far to the question of authentication of a system (e.q. how do you
tell is an "extra added attraction" is present) again seems to be
missing a point settled some time ago:

	The simplest answer to the dilemma is to separate into two tasks:

1) Determine the BIOS entry points for interrupts needed to authenticate
   the system.

2) Authenticate the system.

	The easiest way to do this is to accomplish (1) during the
BIOS load before DOS (or any other O/S) has had a chance to muddy the
waters.  Since at BIOS time, a PC is a fully functioning computer, it
is posible to retrieve the pointers to essential elements (Interrupts
0-1Fh) and store these values in an accessable location, possibly
encrypted.

	Since these vectors (keyboard, local storage, monitor) are
still usable even after loading of the O/S. Programs can be run at any
time that use only these known clean accesses. Such programs can be
effective even in an infected single-tasking machine. These access
values may be stored either on-line, at the server level, or off-line
on floppy disks.

	If necessary, the entire subroutine for such access to the INs
& OUTs level could be maintained separately so that use of
potentially-corrupted interrupts would never be necessary.

	Given clean and authenticatable periperal paths, integrity
programs and scanners can be run at any later time with the ability to
bypass possibly untrustable elements thus rendering all currently
known stealth techniques useless.

	The authentication task may then be invoked at any time before
or after the loading of the O/S with expectation of valid results
being obtained.

	It is interesting to note that such a methodology would remove
the necessity for memory scans that have caused so much trouble lately
since no resident routines would be necessary for execution.

In the course of putting the partition table aspect of this together,
I've come across some questions which I need to answer before I can go
further:

	1) I am implementing the partition table rebuild code as a
device driver to be launched from a cold boot from a floppy.  However,
the partition table has to have been already read for DOS to be
setting up drive letters internally (I assume, with all that implies
:-).  Is there a chance of having a partition table virus already in
memory from that process?

	2) Is it absolutely necessary to reboot to rebuild the DOS
drive designations after making changes to the partition table?

	3) If the answer to 2) is yes, I am considering ways of
preventing any unnecessary monkeying with the partition table.  Is a
byte-by-byte compare of the partition table bootstrap code with a
known good copy an effective means of doing this?

I thank you all in advance for any assistance.

Subject: F-PROT configuration question (PC)

Hello,

   We are currently in the process of obtaining F-PROT for our 100 PCs
in the Business Computer Lab at The University of Alabama.  We are
also using the Novell 3.1 NetWare.  Our workstation's C drives are
write-protected, so our users can only infect the memory, their own
floppies, and the D drive which is used as a temporary drive.  We do
however have a couple of workstations for the uses of the consultants
in which the hard drives are not write-protected.  My question - Do we
need to use the F-DRIVER.SYS?  The only people who can infect the
network are those who have access to places on the server other than
their own personal directory.  These are only the consultants, and we
are aware about scanning anything before we download or use a floppy.
Any comments would be appreciated.

There has been some discussion in comp.sys.novell about a new "virus"
called SECURE.COM which opens up and damages netware binderies.
No-one has seen it themselves yet, everyone has heard about it, so it
may be another "urban legend".  It is likely that if it does exist
someone in this group will have heard of it, or be CERTAIN that it
does not exist.

If you have information of SECURE.COM, please post something to
comp.sys.novell.

I would like to say that multiple compressions are possible for
someone who desires to do so.  It took me approximatly 30 seconds to
succesfully accomplish a compression with both pklite and lzexe on a
program I had just written.  The method is a trivial method, which
involves no modification of any of the programs and, as I said can be
accomplished in less than 30 seconds.

It may be worthwhile to mention whgat version of each you are using, Dimitri.
It occurs to me that this wouold make a difference. Also, please indicate in
what order this was accomplished. For some reason, in the versions I was
running I was unable to do what you suggest, in any order...

Subject: Questions - list of viruses, writing a scanner

This may seem like a totally rehashed question, but pleasse bear with
me.  I have been on this list some time now, and feel that I have
enough of a grasp of viri (virii?) to try and write my own version of
a detector/ fixer for virii.

Question 1: I know that there is a list, accessible by ftp, that
specifies a lot of the PC viruses, ways to detect them, and ways to
fix the data that has been corrupted.  Can someone please give me a
pointer to this?

Question 2: From all of the experienced writers out there, any hints
on what is the best approach to writing a scanner/detector/fixer?
There have been a lot of views expressed in this list and they vary
widely.

Any help on this would be very greatly appreciated.

Not if we're talking of the same incident. The company that develops
the software in the swithes, has admitted the bug was introduced as
part of an upgrade. But, because it was such a minor upgrade, the
software had not been tested af rigourusly as it should have been. See
comp.risk (or was is comp.dcom.telecom) for more details.
