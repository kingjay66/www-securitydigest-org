VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

In V4I110, I posted the first couple sections of a product review on
Central Point Anti-Virus by Chris McDonald, but forgot to add a note
saying that the rest of the review (and Chris's other reviews) is
available by anonymous FTP on cert.sei.cmu.edu (IP number
128.237.253.5) in the pub/virus-l/docs/reviews directory.

Subject: What info is avilable on viruses? (PC)

Does anyone have a list of different virusus and their know effects on
the computers that they infect? And where can I get the latest version
of SCAN?

I'm asking because I'm new to virusus. I've been in computers a while,
but never in such a virus prone environment like a University.

Any replies would be welcome as I have a very scarce knowledge about
this subject. I.e. I know about stoned and that's about it, I don't
even know what it does apart from saying "Your PC is now stoned!".

Thanks.

Subject: Why Patricia Hoffman's virus summary is not on SIMTEL20 (PC)

I have received many inquires as to why SIMTEL20 does not have VSUM,
Patricia Hoffman's virus summary list.

SIMTEL20 is prohibited by the author from carrying VSUM.  Patricia
Hoffman blamed us for a problem caused by someone who downloaded her
file from our collection.  Since her virus summary list is copyrighted
we must comply with her wishes, even though the file is available on
almost any BBS and many other FTP sites.

The file is available from risc.ua.edu [130.160.4.7] in the directory
pub/ibm-antivirus.

There is at least one batch file running around that, when you "exec"
it, it turns into a virus.

If a machine is using ANSI.SYS, it is possible to rename files to
provide for reprogramming the keyboard.  An argument can be made that
causing the, say, F3 key to execute some program or some some batch
file due to it being reprogrammed could mean that doing a simple
directory could later *cause* a virus to be executed.

No, I get the point: my income depends on it.  I had a bug.  It's fixed in
Version 1.5, released about ten minutes ago.  A reality check would show
that out of the thousands of people who run our code daily, about ten have
complained about the interaction due to a bug that is now fixed.

No matter what string is used, and no matter what the encryption routine
for that string might be, it would be trivial to ascertain what that string
is -- and without having to break the encryption.  I know that your intentions
are most likely good, sir, but you really have not stopped to consider
all the issues before you post.  You may think you have the solution to a
non-problem, but your solution does nothing except add another area where
a bug can creep in without providing anything but a *potential* feel-good-
warm-fuzzy feeling.  It does nothing but provide me with extra work and
does not provide any benefit to the end user community.

Simply becasue somebody says that encrypting the strings is a good idea
does not make it a good idea.  And, except for a bug that occurred in
certain circumstances, the cleanup was typically done.

Actually, it just showed that our beta testers did not run into that
problem (recall that the reports I mentioned above were limited in number).
This implies that they don't use one of our competitor's products. So what?
There are many people who opt not to use our competitor's products.  In
fact, I hope to make sure that hardly anyone uses any of my competitor's
products by providing better code than anybody else.

And, sometimes, a minor mistake is make and is blown way out of proportion.

Subject: Can such a virus be written .... (PC)

Most DOS PCs do not implement a hardware 'media change' flag, so they
do not know that a diskette has been inserted until you try reading
from it.  (this is unlike an Apple Mac that has a 'media change' sense
on its diskette drive).
A virus doesnt 'know' that a new diskette has been inserted on a PC
until the virus has had a look at whats there. Of course the write-protect
notch/slide is 99.99% effective in my experience at preventing any
illicit writes; you would, of course, have write-protected any diskette
you put in the drive before doing the hypothetical DIR command, wouldnt
you?
(I do actually have a notchless diskette that on *some* drives can be
written to - the diskette jacket is semi-transparent and on drives
that use optical notch-sensing, enough light *sometimes* gets past to
make the thing writable....  oh confusion!)

This is good news.  I was under the impression that Microcom attempted
to license a copy from you and was told that they may not use it
without a license and that a license would not be issued to Microcom
under any circumstances.

I am glad that the information given to me is false and that Microcom
is expressly being given permission to utilize this product from the
vendor.  I would presume there is a charge for such usage: what would
that charge be for *only* one computer to use your product? I'll be
sure to report that amount to the Microcom people I deal with.

Subject: VIRx Version 1.5 Released (PC)

I'm pleased to announce that version 1.5 of VIRx has been released,
today, for distribution.  VIRx is a freely distributable scanning
program -- there is *no* charge associated with it, although
copyrights *are* maintained by both Microcom and me.

You should be able to grab a copy off of SIMTEL-20 almost immediately.
Additionally, it is available on CIS and on my BBS at 212-889-6438.

===
                   What's New In VIRx Version 1.5
                   ==============================
Date: 6/26/91

   1.  VIRx 1.5 detects over 80 additional newly discovered viruses,
   bringing the total to almost 500.  This was accomplished without
   slowing down the scanner.

   2.  Wildcard string scanning is included for detecting viruses
   otherwise resistant to general scanner detection.

   3.  VIRx scans PKLite pre-compressed files internally about 10%
   faster than previous versions; probably not noticable except on
   slower machines.

Problems Corrected from v1.4:

   1.  Another rare problem with scanning certain Novell Network server
   volumes has been corrected.

   2.  The technique used to clean our scanning search strings out of
   memory has been changed. This change will prevent certain other
   anti-virus scanners from erroneously reporting an assortment of
   viruses active in the computer's memory immediately after a VIRx
   scan has completed.

   3.  Certain rare situations would result in VIRx scanning extremely
   slowly. This has been fixed.

I don't know if there are any ftp'able software but there is a
product called TCell which the company I work for manufactures.

***** BE AWARE!! Information about this commersial product follows... *****

TCell is more than an antivirus system, it detects any kinds of unexpected

for example to keep control that software not is changed after it's release.
You can probably think of yet other use in your organization.

TCell can also be used as a virus detection tool for PC's using software

Amiga : yes it is possible, and done, I only know of one virus which does
        that, this one is called SADDAM.
        The "bug" that allows the method used by SADDAM is fixed in the (more
        or less released) new version of the operating system (AmigaDOS 2.0).
        I don't think it should be possible in AmigaDOS 2.0.

This is not true. As the college virus tracker, I try to keep
up-to-date copies of most anti-viral products. Of course, I can obtain
copies of McAfee'ssoftware but when I try to pay the fee, I get back a
form letter saying they will not sell a single copy to a college -- we
must spend thousands to obtain a site license for ALL our PC's,
whether we would install the programs or not. If this is not a refusal
to sell, I would not know what else to call it.

We have a site license from another vendor which was considerably
cheaper.  Even that one is quite expensive considering that we don't
actually use the product on all the college computers. We are also
looking into a site license for F-PROT, since that is certainly the
cheapest site license around.

I did notice the inaccuracy in VSUM's Joshi listing. I, too, did not
want to nitpick a document that obviously requires great time and
effort to produce. I have tested several products with the Joshi virus
and all can now remove it. I have not been keeping up with my VIRUS-L
reading or I would have responded to that posting. CPAV, Vi-Spy and
F-PROT will all find and remove it. My copy of Virex-PC did not but
the dates on the files are over a year old, even though we purchased
from Egghead only 4 months ago. (I have never received any update
info). I do not remember if NAV removed it or not. I rarely use it any
more in tests since it performed poorly when first tried.

Hello Mr. Chopde,

There are lots of anti-viral programs available now, both shareware
and commercial, so without trying to be too specific, here are some
things you may wish to look for:

1.	Type of virus detection offered: That is, upon what criteria
does the anti-viral program base its "decision" that a virus has been
found?  This is generally broken down into three categories: filters,
changer checkers, and scanners.

A filter is a program that installs itself as a TSR and monitors the
system for virus-like activity (i.e., attempting to format a hard
disk, write to a program file, and so forth).  Filters have the
advantage of being able to detect new viruses because they are not
looking for specific viruses, but rather virus-methods.  The
disadvantage is that they can be prone to false-alarms by programs
which may do virus-like activities for legitimate reasons (say an OS
or application update program that patches the executable code of the
original program); they also have to be periodically updated when new
virus-techniques appear that the program did not monitor; also they
may have to be configured to allow programs that may do virus-like
activities (say, a disk optimization program) to function--this is not
really a problem with individual (home) users, but if you're
responsible for several 100's of PC's, installation could be painful.

A change checker (and this is a category that includes checksum,
cyclic redundancy checks (CRC's), cryptographic checks, and so on) is
a program that computes a known value for a program file (or other
area of the system) and is then periodically run to compare the
program file against.  If the known value and the just-computed value
don't match, then the file has been modified and may be infected with
a virus or otherwise tampered with.  The advantages to change checkers
are that they will detect known and unknown viruses, like the filter,
because they are not checking for specific pieces of code, but rather
for changes to a computed value.  They're also good for spotting
tampering--more of a computer security-related concern then virus-
specific, but it is a function.  The disadvantages of this method are
that this only works if the change checker is installed on a
virus-free machine, otherwise the known values computed will reflect
the viral code attached to its host; also, it's been theorized that if
the method of change checking is known, a virus could be written to
add itself to files in such a way that a checksum identical to the
known (good) checksum is generated; the last problem I can think of
with change checkers is that if there is a "stealth" virus present (A
virus that installs itself as kind of a "file handler" in the OS) then
the virus will trap reads by the change checking program, remove the
viral code from the infected file, and then pass on to the CC program
a "clean" file.  This last one can be prevented by booting the
computer with a clean (virus-free) operating system and then running
the change checking program.

A scanner works by checking the system for pieces of code unique to
each virus.  The scanner reads the files (boot sector, partition
table, etc) of a disk and does a match against a database of bytes
that are segments of viral code unique to each virus.  When a match
occurs, a virus is reported.  This is effective for finding known
viruses, since a positive ID against the virus is made.  Of course, a
false alarm could also occur if a file had the same instructions in
it.  Scanners can also check for "generic" routines, like a series of
program instructions to format a disk, but these are not as reliable
as the matching of viral code with its "fingerprint" of bytes because
a file may have use such a routine for legitimate purposes.
Disadvantages to this are that a scanner will only detect known
viruses and must be updated frequently, a "stealth" virus could hide
from the scanner, and possible false alarms.  And of course, as more
viruses are added, the scanner gets s l o w e r.


2.  Vendor Support: That is, what sort of assistance will the
manufacturer provide?

Anti-viral software (like any software tool, only more so <GRIN>)
generally requires more assistance then other forms of software, or
perhaps I should say, more assistance of a specialized nature.
Removing a virus can be somewhat tricky because a long set of steps
have to be precisely followed to remove a virus AND prevent
re-infection.  And of course, there is the matter of any data on
infected media that may have been corrupted in some way.  So,
knowledge (and it's accompanying twin, experience) are a factor.  What
sort of assistance does the vendor provide?  Does the vendor have a
telephone number, a fax, a BBS, internet or online services address
that you can access?  Is the telephone number 24 hours toll free?  Or
limited hours and toll.  Is there a charge for assistance or is it
free?  If there is a charge, do you have a certain amount of free
assistance?  What about local reps?  Is support handled through the
head office which may be in another country, or are there
manufacturer's reps or a branch office in your state (province,
district) or country?

Another factor is currency (yes, money too, but more about that next),
by which I mean how current is the program?  Does it need to regularly
updated?  Does an update file need to be added, or does the package
have to be completely reinstalled each time?  How are updates made
available, and for how long?  Can they be downloaded or mailed or
faxed to you?  Are they free or do you have to pay for them?  Do you
get a certain amount of free updates?  If so, how is this handled?  If
there is a cost for updates, how much is it?

Is the software purchased (or licensed) for life or for a certain
amount of time?  If for a limited time, then how long?  What happens
when the license period runs out?

And how much does it all cost?  And referrals.  Does the manufacturer
have satisfied customers whom you can ask about product?

Well, sorry for making such a long post, but I did want to address as
many issues as I could think of off the top of my head.  I hope this
gives you some factors to consider.
