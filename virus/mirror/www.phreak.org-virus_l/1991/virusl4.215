You alarm me. Your roomie killed your hard disk copy and all of your
backups, too? :-) I believe that the documentation for VirusDetective
specifically states that using its "delete viral resources" feature
can damage your files; I always take "can" in documentation to mean
"will". Install the Disinfectant INIT. Free and small.

No. It *will* spread. Running an infected program will infect your
machine. Scenario: Run an nVIR-infected program with no protection.
It starts up and noiselessly infects the System file. You shut down.
You reboot. You run another uninfected program. The copy of the virus
in the System file gets the new application. You have gained nothing.
If most of your Commodore disks are bootable, essentially you have
multiple different computers which all run a single program and
which never contact each other. That's what keeps viruses down on
your Commodore.

I'm not so sure about "can't". Certainly interpreter-level viruses
could be spread on a Commodore; how about a viral BASIC program?

Subject: IBM Anti-Virus Product 2.1.5 (PC)

A new level of the IBM Anti-Virus Product now exists.  It should be
available now or shortly from IBM Marketing Reps, Branch Offices, the
Electronic Software Delivery section of IBMLINK, and on Promenade (the
PS/1 support BBSy-thing).  I'll attach the contents of the WHATIS.NEW
file.  As I said a bit ago, I'm not an Official Anything, so don't
send me your money!  *8)

This has actually been out for a little while now, but I just
noticed.   Sorry as usual...

As before, the U.S. terms are $35 for an original license, $10
for an upgrade (for terms outside the U.S., contact your country
IBM).  Note that these prices are for an *enterprise* license, so
if you are a company with a thousand employees, it's $35 for all
thousand copies.

The last released version was 2.1.2, this is 2.1.5.   Versions
2.1.3 and 2.1.4 were internal IBM versions, and not released.

               The IBM Anti-Virus Product, Version 2.1.5
             Copyright (C) IBM Corporation 1989, 1990, 1991

The following are the highlights of the changes and enhancements made
to The IBM Anti-Virus Product since the release of Version 2.1.2:

   - Added new virus signatures, modified signatures to identify virus
     variants, and updated virus information (refer to VIRSCAN.DOC,
     section 5.1, for more details)

   - Added a new "test mode" (-X) switch.

   - Improved VIRSCAN's identification of network drives in protect
     mode sessions under OS/2 1.2 and later.

   - Provided the ability to scan master boot records in OS/2 protect
     mode sessions.

   - Locked drive no longer identified as a network drive.

   - When "APPEND /X"  or "APPEND /X:ON" is used, VIRSCAN no longer
     scans every directory in the APPEND path multiple times.

   - Made changes to handle an error reading HPFS boot sectors when
     VIRSCAN is run in the OS/2 DOS Box.

   - Added support for "family signatures" to some virscan signatures.

   - Added a "-U" option that allows users to add filetypes to the
     default filetypes that are scanned (e.g., to scan for all files
     of type EXE, COM, OV?, INI, SYS, BIN, and GUM on the C: drive
     enter the command  VIRSCAN C: -U*.GUM)

   - Added support for an "options" file.  Virscan will look for the
     file "VIRSCAN.OPT", in the same directory as "VIRSCAN.EXE", and
     if found VIRSCAN will read command line options from that file
     and add them to whatever command line options are on the actual
     command line.  The -NOPT switch is available to turn off the
     option file support.

True enough, I know of no way to bypass, via software, the write
protect feature.  Such diskettes are not absolutely secure
however.  I once made a simple modification to a floppy drive so
I could write to protected diskettes.  These diskettes were used
in a student lab where the students could not accidentally infect
them with a virus.

If I had malicious intent, I could have "borrowed" someone's
original protected application diskette, and infect them. If that
person assumed that no virus could possibly be on that disk, and
failed to scan them, they would find themselves infected.

Granted, this is not simple virus infection, but a combination of
sabotage and virus attack.  The point is that too much confidence
that you have a "perfect" defense can leave you vulnerable to other
forms of attack.  Now if you keep your diskettes in a safe.......

We have a high Infection rate of public access disks.  They are
infected with the virus AirCop according to McAfee's Scan program.  So
far there have been no problems with the disks, except that they have
the virus in the boot sector and infect any other disks they come in
contact with.

1.  Can a data disk (not bootable) which is infected with AirCop
infect another disk (bootable or not) with AirCop.  (I am about to run
some tests and see if this is true, but I would like some other
opinions.)

2.  Is this virus as benign as it appears.  What does it do except
infect other disks.

No one skilled enough to post to VIRUS-L counts as a "real user" the
way I was using the term!  *8)

OK, I think we're converging as we come to understand better what
we're really saying.  This generally seems to happen in
net-disagreements!  Once all the differences in tone and accidental
offenses are cleared up, people have only slight bits of
easy-to-live-with disagreement, if that.  I would disagree that
promotion, availability, and distribution are the *only* reason that
people are using software rather than hardware, but it's certainly
part of it.  I think it'd be neat if good hardware solutions would be
designed and made available.  Maybe we can usefully brainstorm about
them here.  I just (still!) think that software will always be useful,
too, and until I see what people put together as hardware solutions it
won't be -obvious- to me that hardware is inherently better.

> Write-protect tabs are not `near'-perfect - they ARE perfect.

This is the sort of statement that causes folks to flame at you!  *8)
It's true, of course.  Or, more to the point, this is true:

  - If you want to make a diskette unwriteable by normal
    non-broken diskette drives, putting on a write-protect
    tab (a nice thick opaque one) works perfectly (modulo
    quantum mechanics).  ((TRUE))

No one disagrees with that.  HOWEVER, it's clear that the following is
*not* true, and your sentence might be interpreted as claiming that it
is (similarly, some of your other statements about hardware have had
similar potential "mis"readings):

  * If you want to keep the machines under your control from
    becoming infected by viruses, you can do it perfectly
    by using write-protect tabs.  ((NON-TRUE))

Now that's of course not true for lots of obvious reasons.  So when
you say that something is "perfect", you have to state very clearly
what it's perfect *at*!  Otherwise you're open to misinterpretation.
Of course, the claims won't sound nearly as exciting if fully
spelled-out that way!  (Sorry, couldn't resist...)  I realize that
your earlier strong statements were also given in a context that
qualified the strong terms.  But in general if you're going to weaken
a claim later, it's best not to make the strong form at all, because
it gets folks' hackles up (at least in part because we've seen
less-technical folks wander by and claim blithely that a *really*
perfect solution would be "easy" if we just had X (or Y or Z); people
probably mistook you for one of those...).

like to see STONED getting as rare as the smallpox virus has become
thanks to vaccination, so that even non-"vaccinated" computer-users
run no serious risk of getting "infected" even if the STONED (like
smallpox) isn't totally eradicated.

Subject: Interesting use for SafeMBR (PC)

Just found an interesting use for the SafeMBR program: If installed
following a clean boot of a machine infected by a virus containing the
Partition Table code in its body (e.g. Stoned, Azusa/Hong Kong,
Aircop, & other non-stealth infections), it will replace the virus
with itself. One caveat however: since the present version was
designed to be used on a clean machine and to preserve the original
MBR, the virus code will be moved to sector 2 and use of the
restoration program (2to1.com) will restore the virus, not the
"original" MBR.

Subject: First SPARC Virus? (Character Replacement Within Files) (UNIX)

 I've been experiencing some very unusual problems and posted the
following article to alt.sys.sun regarding the phenomenon.  I've
included it here for your consideration and/or suggestions/comments.
- -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
 Recently, it was necessary for me to restore an entire filesystem from
backups.  The system in question is a SPARCstation 1+ with 40M, CG3, two
1.6G Wren drives, one 1.2G Wren drive, no internal drive, EXB-8200 8mm,
and Wangtek 6200HS 4mm tape.

 After successful filesystem restoration from tape, I noticed that there
were quite a few errors going from single user to multiuser due to
syntax errors in the /etc/rc* files.  Specifically, character: "[" was
turned into "{" and "]" was turned into "}".  This, however, was not the
only anomaly or set of files experiencing problems.  The format.dat had
several instances of the "\" being replaced by "|".  In both situations
not every instance of the affected character experienced this
replacement phenomenon.  It seemed to randomly affect the target
characters in different places.

 Thinking back, I recall several instances when compiling source that
/usr/include/*.h or /usr/include/sys/*.h files would have syntax errors.
Usually in the form of spurious "^?" characters appearing at
strategically annoying spots in the subject .h file.  I didn't think
anything of it at the time, but now it occurs to me that the strange
system failures that I've experienced lately may be due to this kind of
corruption taking place within binary files (or the kernel [vmunix] file
itself).

 Has anyone else out there seen this kind of phenomenon before?  The OS
version I'm using now is 4.1.1 from the CDROM distribution.  Only source
from reasonably secure locations have been compiled and utilized (if you
consider UUNET and gatekeeper.dec.com to be "secure").

 Suggestions or comments would be appreciated as this is my personal/home
machine and I can ill afford any more loss of data integrity.

(Is this a matter CERT should be made aware of?)

 Well, yes. I didn't have THAT much permanence in mind <g>. When

 What I meant is that, unlike software antivirus devices, which

Wrong.  Either you have a very unusual understanding of what a virus
family means, or you simply misunderstood my article.  My list of
families is by no means perfect - there are a few cases where questions
remain, such as whether the W13 group should be considered a separate
family, or just a subgroup of the Vienna viruses.  In general, however,
I believe most researchers accept most of the entries in my list as
legitimate families.

It is useful to a few people who have a good understanding of viruses,
who recognize most of the names, and who have already developed a similar
list of families on their own.  I admit it is of little use to most
readers of this newsgroup, except maybe to give an idea of the complexity
of the classification problem.

Yes, this is exactly what I am doing.  Of course, around half of the
families have only a single member, with the rest containing from 2 to 50+
members.

The rationale is quie simple - If two viruses are developed independently
and share practically no code they are classified as belonging to two
different families. Period.

> without even listing what individuals fall in each "family"

I don't think any researcher with a sizable collection of viruses has
a problem with that part - there is no real disagreement on how to group
viruses together - and it is generally easy to determine how closely related
two viruses are. The only reason I posted the article - and you obviously
missed that point, is to list a proposal of which groups of viruses are
sufficiently distinct to be considered a single family.

> of 270 taxa!      :-((

Well, you may not like that fact, but that's just the way it is.  We have
nearly 300 independent groups of viruses, with 1000+ variants.  Just
classifying them into 270 (actually more like 290) families is a necessary
first step.  If you have any ideas on how to create fewer familes then
please publish them.  If not, please don't waste my time - I'm trying to
get some useful work done in classifying viruses.

I have a similar program, and from Vesselin's description it sounds as
they work in a very similar way.  It is able to remove almost all
Jerusalem variants from .EXE files, and is equally good at handling
"new" variants.  What my program does is simple:

    It first determines that the "victim" is really infected
    with a Jerusalem-related virus.  This step is so obviously
    necessary that it does not make sense to proceed if it fails.
    However, this classification is partially performed by the
    program looking for a specific section of code, which contains
    information on the length of the virus, and the location of
    the information which was extracted from the header of the
    original program - initial CS:PC and SS:SP

    This information is read, written back to the beginning and
    the file is shortened - cutting the virus off the end.

I have not distributed this program - simply because I feel it is a
matter of principle that a program should not attempt to disinfect
"unknown" viruses.

> Second, the "family" he was talking about remains un undefined
> entity.

Not undefined, just a bit fuzzy. The questions that have not been
answered, regarding the Jerusalem family are:

    1) Should Suriv-1 and Suriv-2 be considered to members of an
       "Israeli"-family, that also includes the Jerusalem viruses ?

    2) Should the two encrypted variants (Slow and Scott's Valley)
       be considered a separate family ?

    3) Should the Plastique/AntiCAD viruses be considered to belong
       to a separate family ?

My opinion is:  1) Maybe  2) No  3) No, but of course I don't have the
final say in this matter.

> Third, from a technical standpoint, the use of a curing
> program to make a taxonomical classification is abominable.

If the program is not able to disinfect a virus it is somehow different
from other Jerusalem-related viruses - it may be a heavily modified Jerusalem
variant, or a totally new virus - something which can only been determined
by careful analysis, but at the very least this method would produce
some useful information.

Nobody has said that all virus-classification should be done on the
basis of the abilities of one disinfection tool, but a generic
family-specific disinfection program, such as this one can provide
information on whether a virus is a more-or-less ordinary member of
a particular family or not.

My program, and I presume alse othe one Vesselin described, will for
example not disinfect Slow-infected programs, because of the extra
encryption code added - but I don't hesitate to classify them as
Jerusalem-variants nevertheless.

> Note that I'm NOT SAYING that the Fu Manchu virus DOESN'T belong to

There is absolutely no disagreement among virus researchers that it does.

You keep making this unsubstantiated claim.  I have a software
solution.  It works.  Hardware is theoretically better against new
viruses, as software can only be guaranteed to be 100% effective
against known viruses, but I have not yet seen you prove that hardware
can be 100% effective against all viruses, while at the same time
allowing normal operation.

Well, of course I expected to say that - otherwise nobody would even
consider your hardware "solutions".

However - I have said it before, and I will say it again, if necessary:

You can protect computers from viruses if you do something like the
following:

    ... Carefully analyse all new programs brought in, to be sure
        nothing infected gets installed to begin with.

    ... Put all executable programs in ROM, or on a write-disbled hard
        disk (of course you have to be sure no virus is active when
        you temporarily write-enable the disk).

    ... Prevent the users from ever copying or compiling a program.

The problem is just that "solutions" of this type are not acceptable to
most users.  As soon as you allow people to compile a program or to
run something "from the outside", you open up a loophole, regardless
of any anti-virus hardware installed.

I am not saying all hardware is useless - Dr. Alan Solomon has one nice
little patent, -  on a hardware modification that will prevent any writes
to track 0, head 0, sector 1 of a hard disk - totally protecting your
hard disk from any partition boot sector viruses.  (of course this will
not protect your floppies, or protect you from DOS boot sector viruses,
or protect you from file viruses.....etc, but it is a hardware solution
which has only a limited effect on normal operations, and it does its
job).

I'm not totally anti-hardware, as you seem to think - I just want to
make the claim that if hardware is to give 100% virus protection it
will restrict normal operations so much that it will never be adopted
by the majority of users.

Describe "sensible but simple hardware protection" that works and is
practical.  Or maybe better still - just produce it, get rich, and
drive me and the other companies that offer a software solution today
out of business.  Then I'll admit that you were right....

Well, it depends.  It is possible that a virus scanner might be written
to bypass the file system entirely when searching for viruses.  It would
interpret the FAT directly, and access the disk, preferably by INT 13H
calls to the ROM.  This would not work for network drives, disks
installed with a device drivers...etc, but in the cases where it works
it provides one benefit - immunity to "stealth" viruses - at least the
current generation.  Acessing the disk on this level does not work
with compressors of this type......

 Mostly, yes - but not ill-intentioned.  By the time I start
 composing a reply, some part of its theme is already clear in
 my mind, and I tend to use that as the subject.

 I confess guilt here.  One reason is that I don't use an automated
 mail reader/editor, which tends to keep "Subject:" lines intact.
 Another is that I may sometimes prefer a different heading for
 the thread.  Another is that sometimes I start a new thread, or
 change the emphasis of the old one.

 The suggestion is good, but I have also seen where this habit is
 abused: the thread drifts to other subjects, but the original
 "Subject:" line is kept forever, well past its applicability.
 I mostly don't like that.

 I'll try to do better, though.        :-)
