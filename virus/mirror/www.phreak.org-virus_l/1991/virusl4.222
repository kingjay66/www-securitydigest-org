Hello Joseph,

VIRUSCAN will by default check files with certain extensions for
computer viruses in case there are some renamed .COM or .EXE or
overlay files.

I think VSUM is on garbo.uwasa.fi.  If you can't find it there, your
best best would be to contact the author directly.

The Disinfectant INIT does not "scan" disks when they are inserted.

It contains custom patches which intercept a list of known viruses *at
the time they try to infect*.  In the case of Desktop file viruses
like WDEF, this may indeed be when the disk is inserted. In the case
of other viruses, this may not happen until an infected application
(or other code) is run. Thus it can still be wise to scan with the
Disfinfectant application.

The relatively specific nature of the Disinfectant's INIT's patches,
the small number of Mac viruses and the fact it does not try to prevent
unknown viruses are what make it small and unobtrusive.

Somehow I also ended up with the stoned virus (or a similar strain as
Norton anti virus say) on my pc. I first noticed it when I had an
error on the dos 5 shell menu stating that I had a wordperfect
savestate error.  From this point on the machine started acting real
spooky..losing screen defalut files, unable to acces dos commands etc.
After rebooting I saw a message saying my pc was stoned! I used norton
utilites to look at the boot track and found a message saying
"leagalise marijuana" (must have been stoned, they legalize wrong!)
anyways I finally got rid of the virus BUT the cmos values of my hard
drive were corrupted. My 40 mg hard drive was now only 33 and showed
100% usage. After finally figuring out that this is what happened I
was able to change the values and restore data. I learned many hard
lessons during this disaster. I have no understanding as to why
someone can get off on doing this. It is pure vandalism and shows not
the persons intelligence, but the their overall ignorance. I hope that
they can put their programming skills to some good use someday.

Mr. Killalea must be using DOS 5.0 (possibly 4.x also) which uses extended
boot parameter blocks. One of the entries in this area is the "FAT12" or
"FAT16" ASCII identifier and  the Aircop sample I have overwrites this area
with hex "33 c0" (would display as a numeral three followed by a super-
scripted "L"). Since SYS sees the extended BPB yet cannot resolve the FAT,
the error occurs. (untested assumption but matches symptoms).

Incidently, with all due respect to Ms. Hoffman, (VSum) I have seen 3 1/2"
disks as well as 5 1/4" infected with the AirCop. In fact the first time I
encountered the Aircop, it was on a 3 1/2 MS-DOS distribution disk (not
from Mircrosoft) that accomanied a new laptop.

Debug may be used to replace the Boot Record with a new, clean version by
loading a valid BR from a known clean floppy of the same size and density
and using this to replace the infected sector. It is possible that these
disks have incurred a double infection with resultant loss of the original
boot record. This could account for the inability for a "generic" disinfection
to properly restore the virus since without a valid BPB the only way to tell
what kind of disk it is would be to look at the letters on the disk cover
(difficult for software to do). (yes, I know it could be derived from the
FAT and CMOS information but it takes an intuitive jump to find it).

It does seem that way - except that mine clearly (and unequivocally)
had 640K earlier in its life.  However, the likely cause is close to
identification, and many thanks to all those who have either mailed me
direct, or made polite suggestions on the Net.  Once I have run a
couple of suggested checks (soon, if I can persuade someone to make
days 48 hours long...) I will post the details for those interested.

This is what set off the alarm bells - it was set up with 640K, and I
even have screen dumps somewhere which show this.  Also, running
NEWDET previously had not reported 'suspicious...memory size is 639K'
- - it was NEWDET which alerted me to the anomaly.

No, this is _false_!  Disinfectant INIT does _not_ scan the file when
it is run; it stops the virus if and only if it attacks.  With file
infectors such as nVIR, this is immediately when the infected file is
run, but with Desktop infectors such as WDEF and CDEF, Disinfectant
INIT will not notify you of the virus until its resource is called,
usually by opening a window (in the case of CDEF) or legitimately
modifying the desktop file by copying a file or creating a folder (in
the case of WDEF).  You can verify this by using a CDEF/WDEF infected
disk under System 7 -- the new OS never passes control to a CDEF
(Control DEFinition) or WDEF (Window DEFinition) in the Desktop file,
so the virus never gets a chance to spread, so Disinfectant INIT will
never alert you that the disk is infected, since it is non-contagious.
For this reason, many people like Gatekeeper Aid, since it _does_ scan
the Desktop file on disk insert and automatically removes specific
viruses, including CDEF, WDEF, MDEF, and possibly (but don't quote me
on this one) INIT-29.

Subject: Cascade & IRQ2 (PC)

Ken West was asking about the CASCADE that showes up for IRQ 2 when
using the Norton Utilities SYSINFO program.

This is an operating system kludge, and I'll try to explain it the
best I can (from the explanation I was given by Microsoft Tech Support
when I was trouble shooting a MS bus mouse).  I may not have this
right.

When the PC was origionally designed, it was not expected that any
computer could need more than 8 hardware addresses, with an address
taken up by the hard disk, LPT1, LPT2, COM1, COM2, the floppy disk,
etc... When the AT came out, cascading was used to allow for more
hardware interupts, where IRQ2 cascaded.  Addressing IRQ's higher than
7 were done through IRQ2 (for compatability reasons).

Although this was first used on the AT (a 80286 based computer), It
has even been used on 8088 computers, I think especially anything
using ISA (Industry Standard Archetecture).  This includes my computer
(an 8088 with a bios dated 1989 by Central Point Software), as well as
the Zeneth 8088 computers we have in the computer lab where I work.
So far, of the computers I have tested using my Norton Uitlities
SYSINFO, I have only found one (a REALLY incompatable 8088 based
computer with a Sperry name on it) that does NOT use cascading.

While not related to the subject at hand, after I found this out, the
next guy I talked with at Tech support for Microsoft told me I had a
'286 when I read off my interrupts to him, because of the cascading.
Mark it up to another case of poorly trained tech reps.

I hope this helps.

The reference to "Cascade" in SI is to the fact that on AT class
machines, IRQ 2 is used to "cascade" the intrrrupts from the first
interrupt controller to the second. Thus it is likely used by the
System ROM as well, and both programs are correct.

You are the victim of terminology overlap. Not of a virus attack.

Subject: Serial port virus detection (PC)

   I have a puzzling problem that I'm not sure anyone can solve,
however a few replies to this may shed some light on the problem.

   An 80286 processor is running in a "machine" that only has a serial
port for programming, and a virus infects the data in memory via the
port.

   This machine hasn't got a conventional qwerty keyboard or VDU or
disk drive.  Access to the programme is via simple user terminals and
breaking out of the programme to key in a virus checker / cleaner
isn't possible.

   The data - not the programme - can be downloaded and uploaded via
the serial port to disk via a laptop or similar. A limited amount of
data space would be available above the data in memory

  Now my question is, If the data in the machine is infected and the
data on disk is also, can either of these be cleaned and the good data
transfered via the port to clean the virus completely. The only way to
clean it now is to delete the data and manually reload it; a very time
intensive procedure.

   The only other information I can offer is that I believe the virus
on the disk wouldn't be active because it would be stored as part of a
data file, and could even be undetected by its normal virus checker.
Also there would be a limited amount of spare memory in the machine
above the data in memory.

   For those that are interested the Virus could possibly be "Asuzu"
(not sure though) and the machine is a PABX.

Thanks in advance, Paul.

>From:    Norman Paterson <norman@cs.st-andrews.ac.uk>
Subject: Re: Taxonomy

I note that most of the schemes for virus taxonomy use a Linnean (?)
approach.  I wonder if this approach can work in principle, since
computer viruses do not evolve in quite the same way as biological
ones.  Life usually evolves by gradual diversification.  It is not
common for genetic material from one species to be grafted into
another.  And each creature must be viable at every stage in the game.
Computer viruses don't have these restrictions.  Their authors can
copy material from one to another, and test their viruses in special
conditions where viability is not necessary.  So should we expect a
tree-structured approach to work?

Another approach might be based on a string comparison, treating the
viruses as strings of characters, and comparing them.  Some years ago
I was interested in this and came up with a method that suited my
purposes then, which was to find mis-spelled names in a register.  The
algorithm defines a function "sim" which measures the "similarity"
betwen two strings, as follows:

1	Let A and B be two strings.
2	Let sim (A, B) = sim (A', B') + sqr (length (S)) + sim (A'', B'')
		where	S = longest nonempty common substring of A and B, and
			A = A'SA'', and
			B = B'SB''

For example, suppose A = "Paterson" and B = "Patterson".  The longest nonempty
common substring to these is "terson", so that:
	S = "terson"
	A' = "Pa"
	B' = "Pat"
	A'' = B'' = ""
So sim (A, B) = sim ("Pa", "Pat") + 36
We now recursively call sim with A = "Pa" and B = "Pat".
The longest nonempty common substring to "Pa" and "Pat" is "Pa", giving:
	S = "Pa"
	A' = B' = ""
	A'' = ""
	B'' = "t"

Therefore, sim ("Pa", "Pat") = 0 + 4 + sim ("", "t")
To calculate sim ("", "t"), we see that there is no non-empty common
substring, ie the strings have nothing in common at all.  So their
similarity is zero.

Adding up gives sim ("Paterson", "Patterson") = 40.

Some of sim's properties are noteworthy.  It ranges over the positive
integers, with no upper bound.  If two strings are identical, their
similarity is the square of their length, so long identical strings
are more similar than short ones.  Another property is that in general
sim (A, B) <> sim (B, A).  I expect you could explain these properties
in terms of information theory, and the chance of mistaking A for B
(which is not necessarily the same as the chance of mistaking B for
A).

In implementing sim, there is scope for clever programming to keep it
efficient.

I suggest we could use sim as the basis for a metric to define a virus
space in which we could pinpoint our viruses by their distance from
one another.  For example, we could define the distance between two
viruses A and B as the reciprocal of the mean of sim (A, B) and sim
(B, A).  Then variants would all be close together, presumably in
little clusters.  Perhaps we could even project the space onto 2
dimensions and look at it.

How about it, Frisk?

The virus is not a bootblock-virus, but it isn't a link-virus in the

Subject: File checking - 2

FUNGEN8.CVP   911115

                    File checking - part 2

Historically, it is interesting to note that, initially,
operation monitoring and restricting software was the preferred
means of antiviral protection.  Subsequently signature scanning
software became more prevalent, and currently holds dominance in
terms of number of programs in use.  Change detection software,
however, has recently become very popular and, from my reviews
of software, at least, now leads in terms of number of different
programs implementing the technique.

The most basic type of change detection program could simply
automate the process of manual file checking outlined in the
previous column.  However, this would not catch "overwriting"
viri, as long as they did not change the file date.  Therefore,
most change detection software performs some type of "image
checking" as well.

"Image", "numerical" or "statistical" file checking is based on
calculations performed on the data making up the file.  At its
most rudimentary, this is based on the "checksum".  As the name
suggests, this is nothing more than a check of the "summing" of
all data in the file, or sometimes the modulus of that sum.
More complex is the CRC or "cyclic redundancy check", which
performs more complex calculations on matrices of the data.
(This is done in a fashion similar to the Hamming encoding used
for error detection and correction.)

It would be fairly simple for an overwriting virus to calculate
the checksum for a given file, and then to modify the code of
the infected file in such a way that the checksum would still
match.  This is the reason for some of the more complex
calculations which are implemented.

While the initial checking of files is fairly standard, there
are a wide variety of implementations for the subsequent
checking of files.  The original information must, of course, be
stored somewhere.  Some programs create a single file for this,
others attach the information to the program to be protected.
Each means has advantages and disadvantages.  A single file
means a single entity which virus authors may find out about and
"target".  Attaching of data to programs which may be altered
means that the calculated codes may be altered or erased as
well.  Sometimes small modules of code are attached to the
programs in order to allow the programs to check themselves.
Unfortunately, adding such modules to programs which already
check themselves for changes may prevent the programs from
running.  (Norton AntiVirus stores the information in a number
of hidden, 77 byte files, with names similar to that of the
protected file.  This caused a number of users to suspect that
the results of Norton's protection were actually the results of
a virus.  One fairly unique ploy is used by "Victor Charlie",
which, in its earliest incarnation, simply offered itself as
"bait" to viral programs -- and then checked itself.)
