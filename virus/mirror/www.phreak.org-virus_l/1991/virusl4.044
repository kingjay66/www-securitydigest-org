Subject: Unknown virus help! (PC)

Hello all.

	I have a little problem with my 386 PC. A few days ago I had
the Jeruselem B virus on my machine (it's going ripe round here). I
got rid of it but somehow it kept coming back....  (I know about the
memory resident thingies etc etc) In the end I got rid of it.

Yesterday, I ran my virus checker from hard disk. It came up with the
warning "Virus checker Infected. Do not use" So I ran the
write-protected version I had on floppy, No virus's found.  Next I
copied the virus checker from floppy to HD and ran it.  It, again,
said it had been infected. On further investigation I found that
whatever I had was appending itself onto the end of the file, around
10-15K worth. However, the virus only appends to a file once.

Has anyone out there got a good virus killer (shareware of course!)
that they could arc and mail me?? Or any suggestions as to what to do
(I don't particulaly want to HDWIPE the hard disk as I have only just
recovered from doing the last one! I do not think the boot sector is
infected which was my first thought.

Cheers for any help,

I'm not familiar with DOS / x86 systems, and this was a surprise.  Why
can't the disks be formatted?  Is the problem related to software or
hardware, or both?

Personally, I blame Lotus 123. Well, what I mean is: back in the early
days when MSDOS could have gone the many and varied ways of CPM (and
there was little need for "exact" clones of the IBM), really high
performance software like Lotus 123 bypassed DOS to get at the
hardware. All of a sudden, micros had to be able to run Lotus 123 (and
Flight Simulator). This required such a high degree of compatibility
that viruses can be written to circumvent DOS and have a high chance
of working.  If DOS became the sort of standard that CPM or (better)
Unix is, where all manner of incompatible hardware run the same o/s,
then viruses would have a tough time spreading.

This is basically a good idea, but for it to work you have to restrict
some things that "good" software has come to expect. This is the
problem. While you can make some areas (like the partition table)
fairly well protected from change, what is there to stop a virus
modifying another executable, for example? Having some combination of
low-down hardware protection PLUS ties with DOS so that it understands
the context in which a write is generated, is better. Now comes the
tricky bit: some installation programs, and compilers, legitamately
change executable files.  It is difficult to automatically tell the
difference between what they do and what a virus does. So a third
level is required... the person using the computer. This might come in
the form of an annoying pop-up window everytime you reconfigure (or
recompile), or some sort of list of known-to-be-okay exceptions (which
has to be *very* well protected).

So a good anti-virus approach is going to consider the whole system:
hardware, BIOS, DOS, applications and end-user education. That, I
think, is a good idea, but you soon end up with something that looks
nothing like the present PC (or Mac or whatever).

> protection scenario.

I suggest:

(1) DOS includes Read/Write/Delete protection on all files at a level
that cannot be circumvented without relatively LARGE areas of virus
code. I like DRDOS's password protection system - good enough to stop
most viruses around today (I guess - someone may like to come up with
a thorough survey). Better still would be internal work areas (like
the "list of lists") that are not only undocuments, but vary
enormously in their location and format randomly from version to
version (or even have each copy of the operating system different!)

(2) An "executable" flag, that can only be set by compilers, and only
be reset by operator intervention. Files with this flag cannot be
openned and accessed in the normal way, and (optionally) only files
with this flag can be executed.

(3) All directory clusters, boot sectors, FAT, and the first cluster
of each executable (what a list!) can only be written to by DOS. This
is easy to do if the BIOS knows the version of DOS being used, and
checks the stack to see the return address.

(4) BIOS should check the partition table, boot sector and o/s files
before starting up, e.g. by calculating a checksum (with each BIOS
chip using a different algorithm) and comparing it with a location in
CMOS that can only be changed at start-up time.

(5) Compilers should produce programs with several different checksums
embedded in the program, at known locations (preferrably within the
first 512 bytes), and external programs should be able to check they
all match. A virus might be clever enough to install itself and fudge
bytes so one checksum comes out okay, but not all of them. Of course,
the program itself should check one or all as it starts up, to make
sure it is the same checksum that was there when it was compiled (this
code, and the second copy of the checksum, would be scattered in a
different place in each program, and impossible for a virus to locate
in all programs it may try to infect).  The aim here is to avoid you
getting already-infected programs, since the above suggestions only
protect files once they are on your system.

The first two simply bring DOS up to the level of mini-computer
operating systems, and implement a relatively hassel-free method of
protection, good enough for most cases, and the cheapest solution for
existing users.

The next two (plus, perhaps, hardware lock-out of certain IO
instructions and interrupt vector tamperring), are much more powerful,
and would probably need either an add-on board, or changes to the
design of new computers. Notice that now BIOS and DOS have to be
designed together, to some extent. Moreover, if the changes go as far
as they should, LOTS of existing sofware simply won't run (e.g.
Norton's DS & NU, all disk "optimisers", many fast backup schemes,
some networking software, compilers, compressors of executables, and
so on). Not something people will want to see introduced over night,
but if the beginnings are introduced soon, in particular into the DOS,
new software can start using these features now.  Notice I say that
this has to go *into* DOS, not another layer above or below DOS
(although these are useful as well), since it is the operating system
that has the best chance of "knowing" the context of the disk write of
whatever, and thus avoiding unpleasant false alarms. It also is the
software that should be setting the compatibility standards, not the
hardware or add-on software.

What do you think?

John,

Most boot sector viruses (like Stoned, for example) will "infect" any
diskette that is put into your diskette drive that is not write
protected!!

As I understand your story, your friend Paul bought a machine with
only 3.5 inch disk drives, but the MSDOS disks were 5.25 inch, so the
salesman copied the 5.25 inch MSDOS originals onto some brand new 3.5
inch disks for Paul.  If the 5.25 inch MSDOS original disks were NOT
write protected when the salesman stuck them into his (evidently)
infected machine, then the MSDOS masters got infected at that point,
and probably so did the 3.5 inch disks onto which MSDOS was copied.

IMHO, master software disks should come out of the box write
protected.  They shouldn't even have the write enable notches cut into
them.  I NEVER put a write-enabled master diskette for ANY program
into my machines.  I ALWAYS put a write protect tab on a master before
inserting it.

I know that there is an increasing trend in the install programs for
commerically purchased software to write on the master disk as part of
the installation program.  Programs that do this include MultiMate,
Windows 3.0, and the newer Sierra games (e.g. King's Quest V).  I have
installed legal copies of all those programs, and I have never written
on my master disks.  This is accomplished by making a backup copy
(using diskcopy) of the master and installing using that copy.  For
software with copy-protected masters, I have found that I can initiate
the installation using the write-protected master, and then substitute
a write-enabled copy just before the writing occurs.

I'd suggest that your friend Paul take the people at that computer store to
task for selling him infected software.

My understanding is that, until March 8th, the correct "public" version
of IBM's VIRSCAN product was 1.3, 1.51 being a corresponding "internal"
product.  However, I believe version 2.00.01 is now available for both
internal and public use.

I'm sure David will correct any errors i've made :-)

Subject: Replies to questions about INNOC (PC)

 I have received numerous questions and comments about my program
 INNOC.COM. Rather than answering the same questions several times, I
 will answer them here:

 HOW DOES IT WORK? All boot viruses look for hex strings in the boot
 sectors to determine if the disk is already infected. INNOC simply
 puts several of these strings in the boot sector so that the virus
 thinks the boot sector is already infected. The current version of
 INNOC inoculates against the Stoned, Brain, Ashar and the Ping_Pong
 viruses.

 WHY DID YOU SPELL IT WRONG? I added the extra "n" to distinguish it
 from several other products with similar names (unfortunately I also
 misspelled it in the docs as INNOCULATE.)

 I RAN INNOC ON AN INFECTED DISKETTE AND SCAN SAYS IT IS STILL INFECT-
 ED? INNOC disables the virus but doesn't remove it. The virus will
 still trigger SCAN and F-PROT, although the virus will no longer
 infect. If this is a problem, run CLEAN or F-DISINF (F-PROT) on the
 diskette then run INNOC on the diskette again.

 WHAT IS NEXT? The Joshi or Disk Killer can be added to INNOC without
 changing it's effectiveness against the other viruses. I will proba-
 bly make these separate programs, though. Any suggestions for viruses
 to write inoculation programs for? I have several boot infectors
 (Ashar, Brain, Disk Killer, EDV, Joshi, Mardi Brothers, Microbes,
 Music Bug, Stoned, Stoned II and Yale.) If anybody wants another
 virus inoculator, I will have to get a working copy of the virus.

 ANY OTHER QUESTIONS? Leave me a note on Virus-L or at MMCCUNE@SCTNVE
 on BITNET.  Mike McCune...<MM>.

Subject: Infecting scanners and "archived" files (PC and general)

A query from a local BBS:

Message #1690 - Anti-virus forum
   Date : 12-Mar-91 10:42
   From : Stan Pickthall

SP> He said that there are viruses that attach themselves to the
SP> scan program itself and will not be discovered by a
SP> self-scan.  So he said it is not really safe to scan from
SP> your hard drive, but that you must scan from a
SP> write-protected floppy to be ABSOLUTELY SURE you are safe.

Yes, the prof was quite correct.  File infecting viri are not choosy
about which files they infect, and will do it to "scanners" as easily
as normal programs.  SCAN does have an "internal" self check, but if a
"stealth" virus is active in memory, it will defeat any kind of
integrity check.

Indeed, some viri actively "target" certain antiviral programs,
although I do not know of any current ones that target SCAN.

SP> PS  If it is necessary to scan from a floppy, the next
SP> question is: Am I safe to unzip the files??  Or can a virus
SP> attach itself while I am unzipping??

Good question, and the answer is, yes, you can infect a file while you
are unZIPping it.

If you have a file infecting virus in memory (active), it can infect
any file it likes, including one that you have just downloaded,
unzipped or copied from floppy.  Some infect in that way, others do
not.

The standard procedure in cases like this, is to boot from a known
"clean", write protected floppy.  That assures that you have nothing
resident in memory.  Then perform your unZIPping with a "known clean"
copy of PKUNZIP.  If you do not "know" the copy is clean, it is best
to "cold boot" after the unzipping.  Note that this does *not*
garantee that the unzipped file is safe, but it removes any infection
from memory before you start.  SCAN does a self check and memory check
before it starts, so you should catch any "known" virus that way, and
the "new" ones are very uncommon to begin with.  The odds are that you
will be safe using this procedure.

Subject: Virus naming

I like the idea of a "virus hash ID" if one could be computed.  For
the popular name, suppose we named viruses like they name comets, with
computer type, discoverer's name, year, and a letter?  e.g. "PC
Skulason 1990c" If you discover a new virus, you name it and report it
to a central place.  Earliest accepted report is the one that's
recognized.

Doing so would glorify the virus fighters instead of the jerks.  The
name wouldn't depend on sizes (vary, different viruses same size), or
strings in the virus (sometimes offensive).

Old viruses: leave the names alone; they're cute.  Arguments about
priority, renaming when more info comes in: bio science puts up with
this.  Who's the central authority?  Some "virus researcher" who can
tell when 2 viruses are the same, and has safe storage for samples.
Volunteers?

Subject: Info on virus products wanted - PD and commercial

What products are out there to deal with viruses?  I'm especially
interested in products to clean up virused disks, as well as
detection.  I've tried looking at the archives on beach.gal.*, but
unfortunately they seem to be in PKARC or ZIP forms which I'm not able
to decode on my UNIX system (I've got regular ARC, and the unzip stuff
I've found in the archives doesn't seem to work on System V.)  Are
there other archive sites?

Aside from a problem at work, which we've mostly cleaned out now, the
person whose machine was infected says his kid says all the PCs at
school have the same problem (Jerusalem-B black spots), so we're
trying to find a public-domain cleanup solution.

( The commercial products I've seen require licensing, which I doubt
the school would spring for, and I'd rather not see them ripping off
code which is presumably what got them in this trouble.  Do any of the
commercial products allow schools to use them free?)
