Nope, that main cause is the unfounded claim that it tests scanners'
reliability to detect viruses. It doesn't. It just fools them to
report a virus when there is none. It cannot fool them NOT to report a
virus when there is one, and this is what most users are concerned
about. That's why the anti-virus writers try to produce scanners that
cause very few false positives on REAL files and just don't care about
the virus simulator. The fact that it fools them does not prove that
they will cause false positives with real files and cannot show
whether or not they'll fail to detect a real virus. It does not test
anything, countrary to the author's claim. That's what cause the
anti-virus researcher's reaction. (Together with the author's claim
that "most anti-virus researchers find it extremely useful".)

I thought that you already agreed that it DOES NOT TEST ANYTHING. A
scanner is reliable if it is able to recognize a virus. It is also
desirable for it not to catch non-viruses, but this is not that easy
for a simple pattern matching engine. What the users really want is a
scanner that gives no false NEGATIVES, not no false positives.
Unfortunately, this is also unachievable, but Rosenthal's program does
not show it, anyway.

That's it! Maybe the cause of the whole misunderstanding is that
Rosenthal's original claim was ill-formulated? How about him
re-stating again publically what his program is meant for? That it
does not, I repeat DOES NOT test scanners' ability to detect viruses,
it just shows that it is possible to fool some of them to report
false positives. And that it is an unvaluable tool for those users
that don't already know that simple fact. If he does this, I thing
that the misunderstanding will be considered closed; the usefullness
of the program will be considered as a matter of taste/experience and
we all can stop this stupid discussion. Mr. Rosenthal?

Wait, it just comes to me that maybe you just don't know a simple fact
that I consider assumed by default. Virus detection programs can
produce two kinds of errors. The first one (often called a false
negative or error of type 1) is not reporting a virus when it is
present in the file. It -is- possible to make a scanner that never
makes this mistake for any of the known viruses. Unfortunately, not
all of the popular scanners are totally free of such mistakes. If you
find that a scanner causes a false negative, you should report it
ASAP, since this could cause a large virus infection and false sense
of security.

The second possible mistake to called false positive (or error of type
2), and consists of reporting a virus when there is none. This is an
annoying, but not a dangerous mistake. Most users can live with it.
That's why, the producers of virus scanners try to avoid this kind of
mistake, but don't apply too much effort to make it totally
impossible. A lot of scanners give false positive, and is usually very
easy to trick them to do so - what the virus simulator proves.

Yes, this is the most dangerous flaw of VSUMxx. Pat never bothered to
correct the bugs and at the current state her document is a wonderful
piece of -disinformation-. I'm really sorry about that, since the main
idea is extremely good and the possibility to use a hypertext
interface is really a nice touch. I would only require a "string
search" possibility - to locate pieces of information in the whole
database... And of course - correct information.

these things either...

Yeah, but it is just unfeasable. It would be also desirable to have
programs without bugs, but this is not achievable either. The users
have just to learn to live with it. And a virus simulator certainly
won't help.

Once again, you missed the whole thing. The main task of a virus
scanner is to find all known viruses. The popular scanner usually do
not fail at this task, or at least no such behaviour is demonstrated
by the Virus Simulator. Not to find any non-virus files is a SECONDARY
task for a scanner, and indeed, some virus scanners fail to achieve it
IN ALL TIMES. They can also be intentionaly fooled, which is proved by
the Virus Simulator.

OK, now try to DISINFECT those 10 %. (You have to supply a special
option at the command line with version 1.16) Does F-Fchk REALLY
disinfect them, or does it say that "this is a new version of the
virus; cannot be disinfected"?

Of FALSE POSITIVE alarms. These are in no way dangerous and I really
don't see what the discussion is all about.

Yes, I have. Here what's going on in Switzerland (Europe) in regard
of that:

A new penal code is in preparation (in Switzerland our law consist
mainly out of predefined rules [code law], not case law). Today,
someone who destroys your computer (hardware) physically can be
prosecuted. In other words: Physical property is protected against
damage by others. With the new piece of law, data shall become
protected too:

"Any unauthorized person who is deleting, modifying oder making useless
electronically or similarily [e.g. optically] stored data, can be be
prosecuted on request." (Art. 144 Abs. 2 Swiss StGB)

    This covers authors of viruses too, even if they do not have
    direct access to your computer (if the virus is not authorized,
    of course). If they are catched (usually they are not ...) they
    face up to three years of prison. If there is big damage, the will
    be officially prosecuted (= even if not requested by the victim).
    Then they face up to five years. Another remark: Everything stored
    in the computer in a "coded" way is considered as "data", even a
    program or boot block is. That's why even harmless viruses are
    covered by the law, because they usually have to modify their host
    in at least some way (to get control).

There are some more articles concerning computers and data, for example
covering unauthorized use of computers, fraud, hacking, theft of data,
manipulation of official computer data. Still, no such words as
"virus" or "hacker" appear in the code directly.

However, it will take some time for releasing this new criminal code;
it first has to pass the parliament and has to be approved in a
plebiscite (Switzerland has a direct democracy). This will take *at
least* two years. Meanwhile, somebody would have to accuse somebody by
citing the general article of "damage of property", which probably
would be enough anyway.

To my knowledge, there are similar penal codes in other european
countries (Germany, Austria ...). However, they are older: Viruses and
hacking probably has been an unknown subject (outside the computer
world) the time their code was created, resulting in those two matters
not beeing covered by law.

I've written some code which does none of these things, yet it still
triggers a false alarm.  This is code which I sell, so I'm not going
to be happy if customers start complaining that a heuristic scanner
claims that it may be virus infected.  Worse, I have no clue as to
what the scanner is finding, so there's no way I can change the code
to quiet the scanner.  If the algorithm used by the scanner is
released, or if the scanner is more specific about what code it found
which indicates possible infection, then virus writers can use this
information to write viruses which the scanner can't see.  I raise
this as a practical problem with this sort of scanner, distinct from
the theoretical problem that a perfect scanner is impossible.

It would be easy for a person in possession of their virus, and a copy
of the scanner, to determine which bytes are in the scan string, and
re-releasing the virus with a subtle change to bypass the scan.

To avoid this, either: your scanner is not free AND you use
unpublished search strings -- it's more expensive for Mr./Ms. Virus
Writer to purchase all sorts of scanners to protect against.  Any
published search pattern OR free program allows the author to bypass
your scan.  Actually, your scan can still be bypassed -- assumes
Mr./Ms. Virus Writer is willing to shell out money to do it.

Last note of interest: I don't notice too many new viruses derived
from old viruses (example, the 'strains' of a particular virus.)
Thus, I must deduce that the authors either have stopped writing
viruses or don't bother watching the scanners and re-writing their
viruses.

You can employ programs like UNLZEXE and PKLITE's ability to decompress
the file, then use your favorite virus scanner on them.  You do *NOT*
have to actually execute the programs in question.

A subsidiary question is that the decompression process may have
distorted the signature of the virus.  But if so, the virus is unlike to
work in any case.

At this point there is much potential for confusion.  Some BSI/PTI
viruses _affect_ (NOT infect) the FAT.  This happens with Stoned and
most of its derivatives, due to the "assumption" by its creator, that
sector 0,0,7 is never used.  This is true on HD's FDISK'ed with
pre-3.0 versions of DOS, some OEM's DOS 3.X'es, and some third party
partitioning progs that do not leave an unused track at the beginning
of the disk.  Stoned (and similar beasties) infections on such HD's
will often be very quickly detected, due to the terrible FAT munging
that their infection causes - cross-linked files, lost chains, etc.
The possibility for confusion arises because many lay/naive/other
users are heard bleating about getting Stoned in their FAT's, which is
either a complete misunderstanding on their part, or confusion, due to
the fact that what they saw (cross liking, etc) was due to FAT
corruption.

For what Vesellin is hinting at to work, I think what would be needed
as part of the infection process would be a little "byte twiddling" in
the partition table entry for the affected partition and the addition/
modification of some code in the MBR loader.

Yes - but note my warning above.  If this was prompted due to
corruption of the FAT by some (Stoned-like or other?) virus, you may
not be able to "repair" the FAT by copying the second copy back on top
of the first.  Whether this succeeds or not depends upon many factors
associated with file creation/modification following the infection,
and where those files are physically located on the disk - in
maintaining two copies of the FAT for you, DOS may have merrily
corrupted your second copy following the virus's munging of the first.

Huh - what I'm thinking of would be easily reversible by copying FAT2
back to FAT1 and fixing the PT entries.

Aha - light bulb flashes in the minds eye ...

Yes of course, because it would have to use some good (as in "well-
implemented") stealth techniques (but wouldn't it then be slightly
simpler to implement using FAT2 as the hiding place instaed of FAT1?).

Subject: BIOS Viruses (PC)

Time and time again the issue of viruses using a PC BIOS as an
infection vector has been discussed.  Opinion here is that this is not
possible.

Last night I was reading my most recent PC Magazine.  In an article
titled "50-MHZ 486 Debuts in Dell Powerline File Server" discuses end
users upgrading system BIOSes by floppy disks.  Quoting from the
article: "The Powerline 450SE also features a proprietary firmware
system that uses Intel Flash memory to store the system BIOS.  In the
future users will be able to upgrade system BIOS by installing a new
file from a floppy disk."

The one thing you could always trust to be safe from viruses was the
system BIOS.  Can this be exploited by virus writers?  If so, how long
before they do?

Hey, I thought it was only University of A****** administrators who
were so short-sited!  (Some people I know won't be pleased by this

have improved, in the last months.  I've never been able to understand
that attitude, though.  Especially at Academic Institutions.  Colleges
and Universities are THE place where computers are publicly accessed
by large numbers of people, often with little monitoring.  Surely it's
no secret that they make for ideal virus breeding grounds?  And it's
not as if we are pushing software products whose reputation we must
protect.

Are there any Administrators reading this group, who can explain to me
the logic behind such administrative head-in-the-sandedness?

Yes, you're wrong, such files CAN be scanned. Consider this: each
self-compressed file contains a small decompressor program, which
decompresses it at run-time. Then, it should be possible to write a
separate program that either (1) performs the same task off-line and
extracts the original file to the disk, instead of in memory (and the
file could be then scanned for viruses on the disk), or it just
decompresses the file in memory, but DOES NOT PASS CONTROL to it
(therefore if there is a virus in the file, it never gets executed)
and then scans the memory buffer that contains the decompresses file
for viruses.

Currently there are several anti-virus programs that are able to scan
also "inside" compressed files. Such programs are McAfee's SCAN,
Fridrik Skulason's F-Prot, Ross Greenberg's VirX... There are,
however, two problems. The first is that the decompression slows down
the whole scanning process. Of the programs, listed above, only VirX
is reasonably fast.

The second problem is, that there are currently a lot of file
compressors. To name a few, there are LZEXE, PKLite, Diet, TinyProg,
Slim, PgmPak, ICE, EXEPack.... To my knowledge, currently only VirX is
able to scan both LZEXEd and PKLited files, although the same should
be expected with the new versions of the other two programs. Currently
NO virus scanner is able to scan ALL kinds of compressed executables.

My own oppinion is that all this is just not nessecary. What we really
need is a shell program that is able to decompress any kind of
compressed file and then run a user-selectable scanner on it. It is
stupid to add the possibility to check inside compressed files to
every virus scanner. Just as it is stupid to make scanners that are
able to scan inside archives. We just need something like SHEZ for
compressed executable files...

Subject: New anti-virus product reviews available

I've recently received several new (and revised) anti-virus product
reviews from Rob Slade and from Chris McDonald.  Due to the size and
number of the reviews, I've decided to simply put them in the
VIRUS-L/comp.virus archives.  Thanks to Rob and Chris for their
continued efforts!

The new files (in pub/virus-l/docs/reviews) are:

mcdonald.index			- Index of Mr. McDonald's reviews
mcdonald.ibm.antivirus		- IBM Anti-Virus Product 2.1.2
mcdonald.seer			- SEER version 3.32
mcdonald.viruscan		- VIRUSCAN version 7.6V80
slade.advanced.security		- Advanced Security
slade.central.point		- Central Point Anti-Virus
