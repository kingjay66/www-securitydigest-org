Subject: vaccine for STONED on boot disks? (PC)

I am happily in possession of INNOC which says it will innoculate against
STONED, but with one tiny unhappy exception: it won't protect DOS bootable
disks.

We are constantly being infected with Stoned from a pool of student disks
and would very much like to find a way to vaccinate against STONED for
bootable disks, ideally to include hard drives, but at LEAST floppies.
Can this be done?  Is it theoretically impossible?

Have a look at Dr. Dobb's Journal, Sept 1991, Vol 16, issue 9; there's
an article called, "One-Way Hash Functions" by Bruce Schneier.  It
lists code for the MD5 ("message digest") algorithm from the RSA
folks.  Think of this algorithm as being similar to a 128-bit CRC,
except that it is pragmatically impossible to modify the message and
get the same key.

Licensing for the algorithm is particularly paletable, and basically
just requires giving credit where credit is certainly due.  You can get
the listing from SIMTEL, it is in PD:<MSDOS.DDJMAG>DDJ9109.ZIP.

Maybe I wasn't clear enough on what I meant by CREATE & WRITE...

1)  When I say 'CREATE',  I mean (in DOS terms) to  create the file (e.g.
function 3Ch) followed by writing the data (e.g. function 40H).

2) When I  only say 'WRITE', I mean (in  DOS terms) to open  an exisiting
file for write access  (e.g. function 3Dh)  followed by writing  the data
(e.g. function 40H).

Because the OS knows how the file was opened,  it can distinguish between
writing while creating a new executable (as in a compiler) and writing to
an existing executable (as in a virus). So there is no problem.

On the subject of source code infectors...

OK, I  agree it may be difficult to spot  a source virus if  it is really
clever about how it patches itself in. But it will be much easier to spot
than a good (or do I mean bad?) DOS executable virus. Also, remember that
there can  be no stealth  viruses to  conceal changes. So  "Easy to spot"
could include "Easy to spot by a simple source code checksummer".

On what I meant by 'Virus Proof'...

Another point that has come from our  discussion is that the name  'Virus
Proof Machine' may have mislead some people. What I meant was a...

'practical PC  type machine implementable  with existing '386 technology,
proofed against  all the usual  and most effective DOS attack  paths like
boot sector  infectors, resident viruses and code  attaching to exisiting
executables, but admittedly leaving a few minor holes such as source code
infectors and interpreted code infectors'.

...but that's too long for a 'Subject:' header, so I shortened it. But as
I  expliained in my last posting, I can be up  to half a month behind you
lot 'cos of  where I get the  digests from in the UK;  It seems that as I
started this  thread, some other  people started theoretically discussing
TOTALLY VIRUS PROOFED machines, so in that context, my title was a little
too shortened.

As they used to say, "use a new word three times today and it will

Let's can this part of the argument and get on with the main issue:
Should we do business with someone who has inflicted a virus on the
community?

I say no (and will limit myself to two examples:)

(1) "Shunning" as practiced by various Pennsylvania Dutch sects.

(2) The Israeli Government's policy of not dealing with kidnapers.

In each case, it may be hard on the innocents involved, but the
results are deemed positive, i.e., the persons making and keeping
to the policy are perceived as "winning" by their community.
(Otherwise there would soon be new policies in both communities.)

Subject: Re: Washburn

One historical note seems to be missing, so far, in the Frisk - Radai -
Murray - Radai dialogue (flame-throwing contest?) on the Washburn virus
(whatever that is) and appropriate punishment for a virus writer.

I don't know Washburn, or anything about when he released a virus.  My
comments here are more general.

We should not forget how rapidly values, mores, and laws have evolved,
relative to malicious computer code.  The first self-replicating programs
were only written a decade ago.  In the mid-eighties the notion that
computer viruses might be harmful was rather new, and was not commonly
held.  Today we all agree that all viruses are harmful, and our countries
are beginning to institute laws to that effect.  But an individual's values
will necessarily have evolved as well.  An individual may have made a mistake
in the past, based on earlier, less developed value sets, yet today
have fully embraced the currently acceptible code of behavior.  That
individual is in a different category than one who is writing viruses
today, in the face of the norms, values and laws in place today.

This principle is fundamental to the development of societies.  Only
a little over a hundred years ago, slavery was accepted in the USA.
Today Americans will occasionally refuse to elect a politician who is
blatently racist, even in a State like Louisiana.  The difference is that
the people of the United States have had generations to work on that
value issue, whereas the problem of malicious code has come upon us
very quickly.

I think we should keep in mind the time frame of the evolution of our
collective values, from "viruses as research entities" to the current
understanding of "all viruses as harmful", when we judge one another's
activities.  Today it would be unpardonalble to release a virus.  Two years
ago it would have been unpardonable.  Six years ago, might it have been
a grave error in judgement, based on undeveloped values, or was it
unpardonable then, too?

Of course the analogy with slavery breaks down: I think slavery was always
unpardonable.  But then I think it is unpardonable that a racist would
be allowed to run for government today.  (Even if he does pretend to have
converted!)

Subject: Re: Radai re: Frisk, re: Washburn

I must agree with Bill Murray.  Releasing *any* compuer virus is an
unethical act that should be deplored by any responsible professional.
Releasing a virus known to be (or suspected to be) harmful is a worse
offense, but it does not excuse the release of so-called "harmless"
viruses.

Viruses use resources and spread to machines without the consent of
the owner.  This can be viewed as a form of trespass.  Although the
analogy is not perfect, it can be compared to trespass on my property
- -- the fact that no damage is done does not make the trespass
acceptable.

Viruses last a very long time in the population, and cannot possibly
take into account all the available software and hardware
configurations that may exist now or in the future.  We have already
seen cases of viruses that appear "harmless" until a new disk
architecture appears, or a new software package is released.  We can
*never* assume that a virus is harmless.

Also, with the mutation of viruses, and viruses being altered by
others into new strains, the introduction of a new virus can still
lead to direct damage.  By making the base virus available, a new
potential for damage has been created.

The indirect damage described by Bill is also a major concern -- each
new virus destroys trust and makes the environment of computing that
much more questionable.  As the count of viruses continues to spiral
upwards, it makes people more afraid of computing, and more likely to
distrust computers.  It also tends to push our lawmakers towards new
(and usually ill-designed) laws and regulations that have a harmful
effect on our profession and society.

Intent to cause damage adds additional dishonor to the author,
certainly.  But lack of intent to cause damage does not absolve an
individual of his act.  Consider that the law distinguishes intent
between manslaughter and murder (in many countries) -- the intent
determines the punishment, but the basic act is still condemned as
illegal and wrong.  Too many evil things have been done by people who
claim after the fact that "I didn't intend for that to happen."  By
now, we should be able to see through the fallacy of that defense when
offered by virus authors.

I argue that morality should be judged by act, not by result.  This is
a position taken by most modern philosophers, and is the basis for
much of Western law and ethics.  The ends do not justify the means.
The presence or lack of damage does not determine the evil of the act
- -- the release of the virus itself is the wrong involved. If you are
interested, I expound further on this theme in "Are Computer Hacker
Break-Ins Ever Ethical?"  to appear in the January 1992 "Journal of
Systems Software"; this is also available for anonymous ftp from
cs.purdue.edu in ~ftp/pub/reports (see the README file there).

If someone genetically-engineered a new biological bacterium that was
highly contagious to humans, and he then dumped it into the municipal
water supply, would you excuse the act if it appeared that the
bacterium caused no immediate damage?  The logic and ethics are the
same -- it is merely a change of degree and venue.  It is an invasive
act without controls and without the permission of the affected
individuals.  It is unethical, and we should not tolerate nor condone
it.

A-Tel only affects the bootblock of floppies and the partition table
of hard disks.  I think the latest version of Clean-up should do it,
or try FPROT2.01

To get rid of the virus from the HD boot from a clean floppy and
assumming you've get DOS 5, type FDISK /MBR which will rebuild the
partition table.

I got the above hint from the nice chappies at McAfess Assoc. Cheers!

Subject: Removing Den Zuk (PC)

Trying to solve a boot sector virus problem.  Some one brought in a disk
which appears to be infected with a boot sector virus.  The following message
appears when trying to disinfect with F-Prot 2.01:

        Boot Sector:  possibly a new variant of Den Zuk

and Analyze reports:  This boot sector contains code which seems to
                      indicate a virus infection.

Unfortunately, F-Prot 2.01 will not disinfect, at least when
"disinfect/query" is set.  I have not tried "delete" yet.

McCaffee 84, reports similar but will not clean.

I'm sending the disk to Fridrik Skulason to look at.

In the mean time, does anyone have any ideas?

I'm able to infect another disk by booting with the bad disk (shows 0
bytes on disk, no files listed with directory) which displays
"non-system disk" and prompts for new disk.  If you put in a new
system disk and hit return, the PC boots fine, but after a scan with
F-Prot 2.01, the disk is reported to be infected.  Again, could not
disinfect with either McCafee 84 or F-Prot 2.01.

Thanks in advance!

Huh. The Katt's Column in the November 25th issue of PC Week has _two_

	...Zinc Software's C++ class library was recently sent out on
	disks containing the Forms virus, which randomly destroys files.
	The company admits it knows about the virus but has no clue about

and

	(called Michelangelo) with a trigger date of March 6, 1992.
	It will be activated only if booted up from the floppy disk;
	Virtual Reality is providing free virus-elimination programs
	for their users...

Is this news to anyone else?

I'm not accustomed to getting virus reports in PC Week :) Gee, if all
it takes to get the free thingie they offer for submitting tips is to

Subject: System checking

FUNGEN9.CVP   911127

                        System checking

The measures described in the previous two columns will detect
file infecting viral programs (within limits.)  However, a very
large class, or perhaps a number of sub-classes, of viral
programs do not make any changes to program files on the disk.

Boot sector infectors replace or move the "boot program"
resident on almost every disk.  Although these viri are
extremely common, surprisingly few "change detectors" bother to
make any check of this area at all.  One reason may be that a
number of computers make regular changes to the boot sector for
various purposes.

"Companion" viri, while they are associated with certain
programs, do not make any changes to existing program files at
all.  Similar claims can be made for "system" viri, such as the
DIR-II virus, which leaves the file intact, but changes the
directory entry in order that the virus, which "officially" does
not exist on the disk, gets called first.

It is, therefore, necessary to check much more than the size and
image of the individual program files on the disk in order to
detect viral infections.  The boot sector (and master/partition
boot record) should be checked, although it is possible that a
certain area should be excluded from checking in the case of
certain computers.  A check on the total number of programs, and
names, should also be kept separate from the system directory.
A copy of the directory and file allocation table should also be
kept, especially in regard to program files.

System memory, and the allocation of system interrupts, should
also be checked.  This is problematic during normal operations,
as programs tend to use, and sometimes not fully release, areas
of memory and interrupts as they work.  Therefore, the best time
to do such checking is at boot time, even before drivers and
programs have loaded from the startup files.  (DISKSECURE does
this to great effect.  So did F-PROT's F-DRIVER.SYS -- which led
to unfortunate conflicts with MS-DOS 5.0.  The security
programmer's lot is not an easy one, with virus writers,
legitimate programs and even operating systems continually
finding new and "interesting" ways to do things.)  It is also
possible, however, and quite desirable, to take a "snapshot" of
memory immediately after the startup sequence.  This should be
able to detect any changes made to programs involved in the boot
sequence, as well as other changes.  (It may also "catch"
program traps which "redirect" a "warm" boot in order to avoid
disk security devices.)
