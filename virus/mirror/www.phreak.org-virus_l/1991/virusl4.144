VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,

Software-only solutions are less secure of course, but they are

which asks for a password when you boot from the hard disk, and cannot
be bypassed simply by booting from a diskette.

There's one called PC-Lock which is shareware (sort of).  A "demo"
version is available from many FTP sites but it only allows one
character "passwords".  The replacement MBR that this program writes
makes the HD "invisible" if the PC is booted from floppy.  From a brief
play with the "demo" version it seemed to work much as claimed.  I think
it also gives you the option of write-protecting on a partition-by-
partition basis.

Padgett's DiskSecure has the option of password protecting your HD, but
I don't think there has been a "public" release of this yet.  (Certain
extremely abberant HD controllers, like one I own, cause grief to the
operation of DiskSecure and some similar programs.)

The way PC-Lock and DiskSecure work is they allow you to create a
"maintenance" disk, so you can boot from a floppy for various legitimate
reasons (e.g. booting without your disk cache to de-frag).  They also
provide "de-install" programs.  Obviously, neither maintenance disks nor
de-installers should be left near the PC, although the former still
require the user to supply a password.

On the issue of being able to remove the protection, FDISK will do the
trick if the PC's are booted from floppy, as the system still reports
the hardware is present, it's just that DOS doesn't see it.  A
determined hacker will still be able to break in by using something as
sophisticated as Norton's Utility and a bit of low level snooping around
the disk and then repartitioning to his/her best guess at the original
partitioning scheme (FDISK again).

     First of all... I would like to express my sincere *THANKS* to
all those people who mailed me their advice and experience on the
above.

     Just then when I was pondering on how to removed the "LIBERTY"
virus, a friend of mine suggested to me on using the SCAN (Version 77)
from McAfee on our LAN Network to try and removed it. I try using SCAN
77 and it detected it.  When I used CLEAN 77, it reported to have
removed it.

     Later on, I tried using SCAN 80 to make sure that the disk was
"clean" and SCAN 80 reported that "No virus was found" !!! Thus I
think that the "LIBERTY" virus that I have was a variant of the
original LIBERTY virus which SCAN 80 fails to removed it safely. As
such, I would recommand to others to try it out with SCAN 77 and CLEAN
77 if CLEAN 80 fails....

     Now that the virus is "removed" successfully, I regret that I
didn't make a copy of it for those interested in diagnosting it.

Thanks you once again...

Is this the MUTATE.ASM file, which comments you asked me to translate?
If so, this file is quite old (it has been available since long time)
and all viruses that can be created with it will belong to the PHOENIX
family. All of them could be detected with a wildcard scan string.  If
this is indeed the same file (please, confirm it), I can post here
scan strings that are compatible with SCAN and HTScan/TbScan(X).

Yes, as far as I know, the ThunderByte card offers password protection
among other anti-virus stuff.

It depends on what do you mean exactly by "cannot". A really skilled
penetrator won't be stopped by a software solution, no matter how
sophisticated. True, you may even encypt the whole disk with a
cryptographically strong algorithm (and of course not store the
password on the disk <g>). This will prevent him only from -reading-
the disk, not from writing on it.

I have heard of a program, called PC-LOCK. It is shareware. I -can-
bypass it, therefore for me it's just garbage.

There is another thing, but it is commercial and is manifactured by a
Bulgarian firm. When you install it (as a device driver), you won't be
even able to boot from a diskette - the machine just hangs. Yeah, this
is achieved entirely in software... Nevertheless, it can be bypassed too.

My oppinion is that such programs are not a very good idea. As I already
said, all of them can be bypassed, if enough effort is applied. Also,
they sometins are in conflict with programs like Disk Manager, that
use the unused space of the first disk track...

Hello,
      We have recently discovered a virus on some of our PC's here and
would appreciate it if anybody out there can recognise it and describe
it for us.  It manifests itself rather blatantly by displaying a
colour graphic on the screen of what looks like the pictorial
representation of the Mandelbrot set of Fractal geometry fame. (if
that rings a bell with anyone). There is also some text on the top
left hand corner "Execute: mov ax feb0, interrupt 21 any key to
continue!". The hex address there may not be 100% accurate. Anyway, we
would appreciate any help. Thanks.

Does SCAN identify the virus? (Does it print a name?)

After you have started SCAN? And do you use VSHIELD?

Is there something more that this message in the files? For such a primitive
virus 144 bytes seem sufficient... Are all these 144-byte files equal?

Was the boot sector destroyed too? If not, does it seem infected? Are there
any clusters, marked as bad on the disk?

CLEAN is not able to disinfect most of the viruses that SCAN detects.
It just destroys the infected files. It is written in the documentation,
please read it. There is also a list of the viruses that CLEAN -is- able
to disinfect successfully. They are not very much - in fact only the most
often encountered viruses can be removed. McAfee's oppinion is that it is
safer to replace the infected files from non-infected backups or from the
original diskettes. I agree with him - very often it is impossible to
restore an infected file -exactly- in its previous state.

BTW, note that there are at least two variants of the Liberty virus.
You can also try F-Prot and Dr. Solomon's Anti-Virus Toolkit as
disinfection programs - they are quite good.

Well, this is probably a misunderstanding, but didn't my mail reach you?
I translated them on the same day I received your message. If you still

Oh, the first thing is easy... :-) I have a small TSR program, that is
both a screen (EGA/VGA only) and a keyboard driver for Cyrillics... If
a lot of anti-virus researchers need it, I can send it to Ken.

About the second thing, well I guess that our language is not easier then
the Icelandic one... :-)

It does exist, it's called PC-Lock, can't remember who distributes it
right now.  I never used it, a friend of mine used it in his office.
I think it is ShareWare.  If you need more info, drop me a note, I'll try
to find it and will tell you where to buy/ftp it.

PC-Lock replaces your harddisk partition table, i.e. without typing
in your password, you can not access any harddrives by using DOS; not
even when booting by floppy.  As far as I can remember they do not supply
a lockbreaker program (no doubt someone wrote something like that), however
any direct disk editor like NDD or DE can probably be used to remove the
lock.  But in order to do this, some expertise is still needed.

You should clean yor disk, because the Jerusalem sort is a really
dumb one. It infects files on and on so it's no wonder they need a
longer time to load. you should be able to use CLEAN from McAfee
(I hope I spelled it correctly) to clean most files.
We had a lot of infections here at the university all over the last
year and we could "heal" most of the files using CLEAN.
Try to get it at some BBS (probably TRICKLE is the easiest to use).
