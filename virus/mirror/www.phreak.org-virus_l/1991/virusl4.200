Subject: Can you help me with this? (Apple ][)

Okay, a friend of mine sent me a copy of an article which claims to
have been posted to usenet (I assume it was to here).  It dealt with
one of the earilest documentable computer viruses, written for the
Apple ][ in 1981-2, at Texas A&M.  This friend of mine would very much
like to talk to the author of this article, but doesn't have Usenet
access.

If anyone remembers this article, or can provide me with an email address
of the author, I'd appreciate it.

First part of the article to follow...  (I don't want to waste bandwidth
by posting the whole thing again).

$_Article

  Sorry this article is rather long, but  if you still have any old  DOS
3.3 Apple ][ disks  lying around please read  it! (Feel free to  read it
for general entertainment  value  too,  of  course,  even  if you  don't
possess any such historical disks.)

  I have  been asked  by Gene  Spafford to  write an  article  detailing
the  life  story  of  a  Virus  I  wrote  for Dos 3.3 on the Apple ][ in
December,  1981 for one of his journals. Spafford wants me to write  the
story  up  because  it's  the  earliest _documentable_ personal computer
virus he's heard of. I'm trying  to get more information that I  plan to
use to make that article more complete.

1) Why did I write a virus? Am I an evil scum?

  At the  time (remember,  this was   1981) I  was an  undergraduate  at
Texas A+M. There was  an active community of  Apple ][ users in  my dorm
(Shuhmacher), with  an _incredible_  amount of  copying of  pirated game
programs going on.   I noted that  most games were  damaged  in  various
sorts of ways, but  they  were almost always still playable despite  the
damage. (For  example, there  was one  popular Star  Trek game  in BASIC
that had occasional garbage  control characters in non-critical  REM and
PRINT statements; space war games  often had random junk replacing  some
pictures  of  ships,  etc.)  I  decided  that  I  could  explain this by
invoking a sort of "evolution".

The situation described by me refers only to hard disk partitions
larger than 32Mb. I've also observed two strange situations with
floppies. In first case on a 5.25" 720Kb (formatted using software
similar to 800.COM) floppy all executable files were cross-linked to
the proper clusters (two-clusters chain, the last being marked as
0FFEH) but those did *NOT* contain the virus. In second case a normal
360Kb floppy was infected properly but it wasn't possible to restore
affected files since their real start clusters (being decrypted) were
also cross-linked to the cluster appropriate for 720Kb floppy.

MY disinfectant does the same... But did you ever try to disinfect
files after deactivating the virus in RAM without rebooting? The DOS
will report an error when infected files on a hard disk will be
accessed.  The reason is that DOS continues to use an in-memory copy
of BPB (or DPB following your terminology) modified by the virus. This
BPB reports several blocks less than the actual size of a disk is.
Hence, the last cluster (to where all infected files are cross-linked)
will seem to be (partially) beyond the disk space. Since a hard disk
is non-changable media, DOS normally asks driver to build the BPB only
once and then uses this BPB parameters. To force DOS to rebuild BPB
you are to use the same trick the virus does - find an appropriate DOS
Device Control Block and mark it as never been accessed.

Definitely *YES*! Such a file is just the virus itself - safe and
sound!  Being executed the virus will go resident and start its dirty
work. When the file will be reexecuted by the virus the virus again
will be loaded since the disk is not (or rather WAS not) actually
infected. This will cause the second copy of the virus to terminate
(do you remember INT 20H in the virus?). So a user will see that the
program just terminated.  But the virus will already be active and
working and replicating...

Well, I'll give more details. DOS 4.0+ disk driver uses the following
request layout:

Offset   Size     Contents
- --------------------------
 +0       1          length of the request packet
 +1       1          unit number
 +2       1          command code
 +3       2          Device Status Word
 +5       8          reserved
 +0DH     1          media descriptor byte
 +0EH     4          DWORD address of a data transfer buffer
 +12H     2          sector count
 +14H     2          starting sector number
 +16H     4          DWORD address of ASCIIZ string of Volume ID
 +1AH     4          DWORD starting sector number (if starting sector
                       number at offs. +14H equals to 0FFFFH)

DOS 3.31 driver's request layout:

Offset   Size     Contents
- --------------------------
 <The previous fields are the same>
     ...
 +14H     2        starting sector number
 +16H     2        starting sector number highword (if length of the
                    reguest packet - offs. +0 - equals to 18H)

So, DOS 4.0+ driver distinguishes between short and long sector number
by using the special value 0FFFFH for the sector number at offset +14H
while DOS 3.31 driver distinguishes them by the length of a request.
They also use different locations for the DWORD sector number. The
DIR-II virus uses request header layout for DOS 4.0+. If long sector
numbers are used DOS 3.31 driver will interpret such a request as
being regarded to sector 0FFFFH (offs. +14H).

>information in this case, but it will report that a mutation of the
>virus has been found. It is not very clear how this situation could be

I don't know the method your disinfectant uses to detect the DIR II
virus but I doubt it'll report an infection in the case. The affected
(not really *INFECTED*) files are cross-linked to the cluster which
DOES NOT contain the virus body. Or does you disinfectant rely just
on (F)FFEH mark?

>handled - since when the disinfector is run, it is not safe to assume
>that the DOS version active in memory is the same that was used to
>access the infected disk...

Rather simple - read sectors 0FFFFH-10000H and check whether they
contain the virus body or not. If yes - compare the cluster number
from the virus body with this from the directory entry, etc.

Hello Mr. Guerra,

By any chance are you running the VDEFEND.SYS device driver from
Central Point Software that comes with PC Tools 7.1 or Central Point
Anti Virus?  If so, the report of the Brain/Ashar in memory could be a
result of having this program in memory, which contains a search
string for the virus which overlaps/matches ours so that VIRUSCAN
reports the viruses' presence in memory.  This will occur with
anti-viral programs that do not encrypt (cipher) their search strings
in memory and match up against another anti-viral program's search
strings.

Not quite. What happened was that when you tried to copy, ResEdit
tried to make a scrap file in which it would stash the resources you
were fiddling with. Guess where ResEdit wanted to put the scrap? On
your locked System floppy...

nVIR and all its variants are only activated on program launch.

Some programs can survive a warm reboot (<ctrl><amiga><amiga>) by
linking to the vectors that you meantion.  The cool/warm/cold captures
get processed when you do a cold reboot and so virus programs like to
live there. i.e. When you reboot the virus is already in memory
waiting to chomp your disks.

KickTagPtr is something to do with making programs resident( Im not to sure
about this) which virus's like to do as well.

Most virus checkers check these vectors out (warm/cold/cool) and they should
be zero.
Although nowadays theres quite a few utilities that link to these vectors,
eg RAD drives etc..

Hope thats useful...

Subject: Possible new virus (PC)

We suspect that we have a virus that destroys the hard drive on our
PCs.  We have had four occurrances of a very similar problem.  Three
times while doing an XCOPY /s from a network drive to the C: drive,
the xcopy has failed, followed by completely losing the contents of
the drive.  On trying to reboot the system, we get the message "No
fixed disk".  The disk is unusable afterwards.  This happened on three
different Panasonic FX-1925S machines after installing an ATI Graphics
Ultra card.  We believe that the card is not the problem, because we
have installed it successfully on five other identical machines.  We
have experienced exactly the same problem while installing Windows 3.0
on a IBM PS/2 model 50.  There was no ATI graphics card in this
machine.

Any help with this problem would be appreciated.

Subject: DOS 5.0 ANSI (PC)

Does anyone know why the key-redirection (<esc>[xx;xxp) portion of
older ANSI drivers written for 3.3 and before do not work under DOS
5.0 ? (might also not work with 4.x - haven't tested this) - when
upgrading, was forced into using the limited ANSI.SYS that came with
the DOS distribution.

Note: the DOS 5.0 ANSI.SYS currently in use is 9029 bytes long & dated
3-22-91. In this version, protection from ANSI trojans can be had by
simply changing the byte containing 70h (p) at offset 61h from the
start to some other ASCII letter that is not already assigned to an
ANSI command. In this manner, you will still be able to use
key-redirection (I use alt-letter to switch drives), just anything
trying to do this using <esc>[xx;xxp (e.g. something you did not ask
for) will not work.

However, I really would like to go back to using my extended
redirection set so if anyone knows why older versions do not work, the
information would be appreciated.

O.K: have to make two points here. First, the quoted statement had
nothing to do with virus spread. What I was taking exception to was
the statement that any software defense can be breached by software.

This is a case of "true in theory but impractical in practise":
the effort required to breach a software defense is greater than that
required to erect it. This comes about because the defender has the
advantage of being on home ground & has a "world view" of the system.

The attacker on the other hand is faced with a two-dimentional
viewpoint and must peel away a layered defense like an onion: each
layer may reveal a new defense structure - a very hard task to
automate since the attack being via software means that the attacker
must anticipate ALL possible strategies while the defender needs only
one (hopefully unknown).

Consider that mainframes all use software defenses yet direct attacks
that do not exploit "holes" rarely suceed. Consider also that the
B2 (orange book) certification necessary for compartmented information
is possible with software.

This is the second point: ("...has nothing to do..."). The statement
that "virus defenses result from virus attacks" is true however the
reverse is not.  Only a small portion of the viruses seen are directed
attacks on defenses, most are simple adaptaions of things that appear
to work. Just to toss out a bit of controversy, IMHO the first
"steath" virus, the Pakistani BRAIN was not designed with "stealth" in
mind, rather the virus would not have worked otherwise.

I said that all that hardware (actually the BIOS had to do was to be
able to select the boot drive. This was not the only kind envisioned,
just the minimum that would be "enough" and be non-intrusive.

True: the BIOS has never been breached but at *some* point you must
begin using software and THIS is where attacks will start. Further, if
things become too difficult for the user or if favored applications
cease to work, the solution will be abandoned.

First - while I read the article, my feeling was that most of the
packages tested would in fact have stopped the so-called "totally
hidden virus" *once an infected file was executed*. e.g. SCAN /av if
VSHIELD's switch to test was used or Enigma-Logic's Virus-Safe. In
fact they must have disabled some things for that kind of virus (a
DATACRIME clone) to work at all.

> Anyway, that comes to an average price of $90 per package

Full list quantity 1 ! How many people pay that ? There are many good
shareware and freeware products out there and still people do not
bother to use them even though the effective cost is $0 if the user
does not care to register it.

True, the key is "may". For the single user, the essential cost is
that of a phone call. For a LAN, once loaded on the server and set for
automatic validation/update on login, we are back to (effectively)
zero cost again.  (why I have been pushing so hard for LAN
checking/updating).

However, at this point I am not considering cost - we are still in a
very dynamic period. What we aree looking for now are different
options that work.  Only when you have equal options does cost enter
the equation. We are not there yet (but getting closer).

However, I propose that BIOS boot selection/validation (and password
if desired) @ zero cost if the proper manufacturer is selected is all
that is needed from HARDWARE, SOFTWARE can provide provide everything
else necessary including protection of integrity from malicious
software as well as mistakes and, in the long run, will be a lower
cost option than anything involving more hardware.

What do you propose ?

Subject: michelangelo virus at Z-Soft (Paintbrush) (PC)

Last week, a local newspaper reporter came in to the office to ask me
a few questions about the Michelangelo virus, which had apparently
been detected by a local computer store (17 cases!).  I started doing
some digging on my own, and found out that the virus was apparently on
a commercial "8-in-1" type program (I don't know the name yet, but
when I do...).  A few minutes ago, another user came into the office
with the same virus on his disk, but he told me that he got the virus
"straigt from Z-Soft".  He reported some problems with PC Paintbrush,
and they sent him (an obviously used) a disk with a few update files
on it (and the virus ;-) Just lettin' y'all know.
	On another note, I now have firsthand experience and knowledge
of why computer virus articles in newspapers get so screwed up :) I
even told this reporter how upset I (and the anti-virus "community")
get with articles written by non-literates and she offered (and did!)
let me review the article before it went to press.  But what ended up
in the paper was the original (uncorrected) version.  Most of the
mistakes were "picky" to the non-literate, but to the literate are
essential.  For example:
	"Shareware is software in the public domain...which can be used
for a certain period of time without paying for it".
	"NEVER boot a hard drive computer from a floppy disk".

and my favorite :)
	"BBS' often spread viruses".

I wrote a letter to the editor correcting these mistakes, but to date
it has not been published.  So there's probably some poor kid out
there with a game which requires him to boot from floppy, but some
unknown "local virus expert" says "Don't".  I have yet to login to any
of the BBS' for fear of the flames :) (what I said was "Viruses are
often spread via a BBS', but very few BBS' spread viruses and it's
just as possible to get a virus from a commercial program".)

	I seem to remember that V80 had [Mich] listed on VIRLIST.TXT. I know
	that V84 does.

Subject: McAfee VIRUSCAN at bootup (PC)

I would like to have my PC run McAfee's SCAN whenever I turn on my
computer.  Is there any problem with doing this???  For example,
suppose a virus entered my system and immediately altered SCAN so that
it would not detect the virus.  Is this possible?  Does scan check
itself before SCANning the rest of the disk?

Any comments would be appreciated.  Thanks in advance.

Can someone please tell me what the latest NAV 1.5 virus definitions are.

The latest ones SYMANTEC AUSTRALIA has on their BBS is 15all04.def
dated the 27th September 1991.  I have found that they are always 3-4
weeks behind SYMANTEC in the USA.

This information will be appreciated.  Also if there is a new file
definition can somone please mail it do me.
