Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing

Subject: Found Tester Virus [TV] in LOG.COM (PC)

Interesting: We just obtained the new version of SCAN, NETSCAN, VSHIELD, &
CLEAN. Thru FTP.    Version numbers:
CLEAN.EXE 6.9V75,   SCAN.EXE 7.2C76,   NETSCAN.EXE V76,   VSHIELD.EXE 3.3C76,
VSHIELD1.EXE VSCRC 0.2
When I try:   SCAN c:\utils\log.com f:\utils\log.com       no virus...
However!! When I try:   NETSCAN C:\utils\log.com f:\utils\log.com
Virus is found!!:        C:\UTILS\LOG.COM
                           Found Tester Virus [TV]
                         F:\UTILS\LOG.COM
                           Found Tester Virus [TV]
BUT! I try to clean:    CLEAN C:\UTILS\LOG.COM [TV]
We get:                  Sorry, I don't know any thing about the [TV] Virus.

Question#1: Why does NETSCAN find the virus & SCAN not find the virus?
                             ----                  --------
Question#2: Why doesn't CLEAN get rid of the virus? Should I UUENCODE the
            file LOG.COM and send it to someone for testing?
Question#3: What harmful stuff will the Tester Virus [TV] do to us?
Question#4: Why is it only the LOG.COM file from PC-Magazine that I've had
            for several years that shows up and infected? Is it really not
            infected and just a bug in NETSCAN?

More news on Tester Virus [TV]
I downloaded CLEAN76.ZIP from   128.237.253.5 /pub/virus_scan & ran it:
CLEAN C:\UTILS\LOG.COM              (I ran norton wipefile f:\utils\log.com
 Cleaning [TV]                       earlier to fix the file server...)
 Scanning C:\utils\log.com
   Found Tester Virus [TV]
   Virus cannot be safely removed from this file.
   Do you want to overwrite and delete "LOG.COM" [Y/n]

I had a backup of the file incase there is a fix for this in the future. I
labeled the disk 'DANGER Found Tester Virus [TV]'

I'll redownload scanv76.zip and see if that solves the problem of scan.exe
not finding the virus. Vshield didn't find it either. hmmm...

Subject: Virus lists for misc machines

If you know of/have a list of viruses affecting various machines (Mac,
IBM, AMIGA, UNIX, etc). I would be interested in getting it. I am not
looking for the code persay, merely a list of names and the machine(s)
they can infect. A description of their effects would be appreciated,
but by no means necessary for this compilation.
(I will of course post a summary)
Thank you,

Well, for now you can just ignore them - they don't exist.  :-)

Seriously though - a virus can only INFECT executable code, not data
items in a database.  The data items can be CORRUPTED by a virus, but
not in a way that will spread the infection.

For example, there exist two viruses targeted against dBASE, known as
'dBASE-virus' and 'DBF-blank virus'.  Both are extremely rare, and it
is doubtful if they exist "in the wild".  They both corrupt database
information, but they do not infect the database itself.

F-FCHK will check compressed LZEXE format files.  In order to do so, it
has to decompress it.

Subject: Trident Microsystems/Packard Bell (PC)

If the reports I am getting can be believed, Packard-Bell computers are
STILL being sent out and sold with virus(es) on the distribution disks.

When first reported last December, it was bad enough and I have had the
opportunity to receive some sealed distribution disks that, when opened,
did contain the MusicBug virus. For the condition to continue nearly six
months later would seem to me to be actionable.

Since the MusicBug now seems to have been replaced (or possible augmented,
they should be able to co-exist) by the Azusa on the SVGA disks is
bordering on the ridiculous but is not unique: Recently I received a set
of Video driver disks that a user brought in with his laptop labeled
CAF. These were infected by the Aircop in such a way as to indicate to
me that the disks were infected before the files were copied onto the
disk.

I am not sure what the remendy is for manufacturers who distribute viruses,
but have felt for some time that our legal system needs to get involved.

                                Warmly,

Subject: F-PROT and FluShot problems

   Hello,
I was testing the new release of F-PROT 1.15a the other day, and came
across an interesting problem.  It happened when a variant of 4096 was
active.  Since F-PROT did not know this strain, it could not detect
it.  This is expected as the documentation hints.  However, when I ran
F-OSCHK, the virus infected the system files (IBMBIO....), the result
was a non-bootable hard disk.  This indicates that F-PROT can actually
contribute to the spread of this kind of viruses.  This is not a bug
type of thing, it is a design flaw!
   I repeated the same test using FluShot+ (1.81), the same thing
happened in a slightly different manner.  But the system again became
impossible to boot from the hard disk.  I had to run SYS C: to restore
the sanity of the system.  Any comments?

Regards,
Tarkan

I don't know about the pulsed or steady light, but I do know that if I
leave the cover off my machine, the flourescent lights totally confuse
the drive as to whether there is or isn't a write protect tab on the
floppy.  I have had no trouble with silvered tabs, but then, the brand
I buy usually comes with black ones.

Subject: help with mac "virus"? (Mac)

recently, we've come across a problem with one of the macs in our lab.
we really don't know if it's a virus or not, but it does act something
like one.  anyway, here are the symptoms:

- - the mac has a 40 meg hard disk
- - there is only about 16 meg of software installed
- - both the finder and mactools report 38 meg used, 2 meg free
- - disinfectant can't find anything, and neither can virus detective
- - there are no hidden files anywhere on the disk (if there are, neither
  mactools nor resedit can find them)
- - the "virus" hasn't spread to any of our other macs

what we really want to know is: is this some sort of new virus, or is
our mac just confused?

thanks in advance,

snugglupagus
