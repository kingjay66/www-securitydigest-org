I thought so too, but lately got into trouble with some Olivetti M24
pc's ... a [Stoned] infection immediately resulted in some subdirs
full of illegal file entries, lost clusters, and crosslinks.

The same thing happened again within a day after low-level formatting
the system, when another user didn't think it necessary to check his
disk or even removing it while rebooting. So I'm pretty sure it's the
Stoned infection that's causing the FAT and/or DIR problems, it may be
because of a non-standard FDISK that comes with Olivetti's MS-DOS 3.2.

Anyhow, it helps to have a backup :-)

In reply to the PKLITE question.  I do not know of any program that
scans an executable that has been compressed using PKLITE.  As a
matter of fact I have just been infected by the 1260 virus that was
hidden in a file that was compressed using PKLITE.  Scan75 does not
detect the virus until the file has been uncompressed.

Hi;

This is my second posting to this group; I'd like to thank everybody
for responding so promptly to my first message.  Now let me ask you
another question. We have encountered a new version of STONED on our
pc's. We ran SCAN V75 but did not recognize there is a virus.
However, when we ran F-DISINF V114 this message was displayed: "This
boot sector is infected with a new version of the stoned virus" but
did not remove it!! Does anybody know the cure to this problem?? Are
Mr. McAfee and Mr. Skulason aware of this virus ??.

Thanks again.

Many times virus removal programs will pad the end of a program to an
even boundary following disinfection since the original program size
has been lost. This is usually noticed on .EXE files. If this happens
to a quality anti-virus program, the internal validation routine will
detect the change and flag the user such as Mr. Curtis noticed. I suspect
that he will find that the file on his hard disk is now a few bytes longer
than the original and if DEBUG (yes you can, rename) is used to remove the
"extra" bytes, the program will execute normally.

I was told this by people at both Brier and Insite. At the time I did not
ask why but suspect that a consumer drive may not be able to properly detect
"weak" sectors or that tracking correction information may be hard-coded at
the factory. In the case of fixed disks, I have heard it both ways & suspect
that it may depend on the drive/manufacturer (rumor has it that Packard-Bell
is shipping a "special" version of Ontrack's DISK MANAGER {ver 4.01 ?} to
customers reporting the MusicBug).

The point I was trying to make was that a physically sound disk
NEVER has to be "low-level formatted" just because a virus attacked it,
but is often used as a substitute for proper training.

HOORAH ! An intelligent discussion (not that I agree with all of the concepts
but at least Mr. Aitchison has done his homework).

>If DOS became the sort of standard that CPM or (better)

Unix is a very good platform but the O/S diversity requires that most
imported files (from Ultrix to Sun say) must be recompiled from the
source code to run properly. Few of the 80+ million DOS users have
this kind of expertise available. The stability and ease of use that has
made the IBM-PC so popular is also favorable for malicious software.
(I live in Florida because I like the climate. Insects also like the climate.
I do not support changing the climate to eliminate the bugs but do have
very fine mesh window screens.)

Not necessarily, at least not from the user or software level. I do
not think that users would have a problem with a screen that popped up
during installation or modification, and informed the user that something
was going to happen and did he/she/it mind so long as it was not constant.

For some time I have been using such a package and when installing a new
program from 'leventy floppies received (and scanned) from a trusted vendor,
just turn off the directory the installation is to be into from checking
for the duration.

Similarly, following a modification to WordStar, the next invocation pops a
screen before loading informing me that it has changed and do I want the
signature updated ? A single keystroke returns everything to normalcy & I
would be more disturbed if the screen did not appear.

Admittedly, this is not a "normal" DOS function, but can be added
without affecting performance or functionality. {am running everything
including Prodigy from Windows on the 386KS (kitchen sink) with 120k of
TSRs loaded high (QEMM/DOS 5.00) and 636k "free" (trade and service marks
mentioned). Testing done by wife, son, and assorted cats}.

Point is that it can be layered on to DOS effectively and transparently,
without "expert" help, but needs more than just a simple program, (some
assembly reuired).

Would love to continue this discussion at your place, I hear New Zealand
is beautiful.

NO ! It will not defeat "any kind of integrity check" though "stealth"
will defeat SCAN's if the /nomem switch is in use (wish we had italics) While
the "stealth" seen so far will defeat a program integrity check, it will NOT
defeat a system integrity check (the six bytes). The fact that few anti-virus
programs bother to check system integrity first does not mean that it can't
be done or even that it is difficult. Even CHKDSK will reveal most "sucessful"
anomalies when resident and "stealth" MUST be resident to work.

Hello,
My father needs to take care of the computers at his work place.

The computers are aranged in a Lab (12 computers) and other computers
in offices.

The main need is to protect the lab as this can be the main place for
viruses to spread from.  My father need some guidelines on how to
protect the lab from viruses...  If you have some knowledge experience
or any idea that might work (including suggestions for anti-viruses
programs) please send them to me.  If there will be interest I'll
summarize to the list...

Thanks in advance,

P.S. I know the discussion was some time ago but neither me nor my
father had interest in the topic...  (digests to look for are welcomed

Subject: programmatic autoexec tampering? (PC)

A mighty strange thing happened on one our departmental PCs today.  I
had just finished using the machine, in the process noting that the
new screen saver I had installed a few days ago was working well.  I
moved to another machine in the room, and someone else sat down to
work at the PC in question.  Within minutes, she was complaining about
a misbehaving screen saver that would not go away.  But it was *not*
the same screen saver I had seen working -- it was an old one we had
removed from autoexec.bat a week before.  All this woman had done was
to reboot the machine and then start a comms program -- nothing she
had done should have altered autoexec.bat in any way, but when I
inspected autoexec.bat, its contents were those of a week ago!

I had booted the machine a short time earlier, and the current
autoexec had run, as evidenced by the presence of the new screen
saver.  So something replaced autoexec.bat with an old copy of it in
the interim between my booting the machine and her booting the
machine.

I am at a loss to explain this.  Is there a known virus or trojan
which tampers with autoexec.bat like this?

>From:    rmason@netcom.COM (Bob Mason)
Subject: Alternatives to Floppy booting

Bob Eager outlines a revision of a method given in the first reference
for getting boot sectors onto a floppy diskette.

jai@lab.ultra.nyu.edu (Benchiao Jai) states that the NYU Ultra Lab is
running MINIX as a process under DOS.

Our MINIX-OS class is presently using floppies to boot the system
(v1.2) on AT-clones. We would like to eliminate all booting from
floppies by recabling the drives. This is needed to prevent the spread
of the stoned virus on the C: partition (Minix is on the D:
partition).

I see at least two solution strategies: either start up MINIX as a
process under DOS (as NYU Ultra does), or have MINIX booting directly
off the D: partition. The second method requires us to put MINIX boot
sectors on the D: partition and provide some "user transparent"
switch-active-partition software that is accessible from either
partition. Perhaps a .logoff file on the MINIX side could access the
switch program directly, since we run DOS most of the time.

If anyone has experience using these methods, or any others, to
eliminate booting from floppy, please post a message to this
newsgroup. We need your help. You can also send mail directly to me
(rmason@netcom.com) or to Ken Majithia (majithia@calstate.bitnet).
Thanks very much.

Greetings,
    I've spent a long amount of time attempting to provide PKLITE
protection, but the method used for compression makes it difficult.
I've attempted to talk to Phil Katz about the problem, but I've met a
stonewall.

    I don't have enough knowledge of compression techniques to be able
to decompress the code at any reasonable rate of speed.

    For right now, the only thing I can suggest is to PKLITE -X the
files, scan them, and re-PKLITE them.  This is, IMHO, a serious
security problem.

    I will point out that the author of LZEXE was quite willing to
work with us when the problem was pointed out.  I'm sure Mr. Katz
would also be, if he considered it a problem.

    As a general policy, do you think that it would be better to warn
users that a file is PKLITE'ed and unscanable or to simply ignore it?
Another problem is that PKWare is planning on coming out with a
'professional' version of the program which includes an encryption
portion that can not be -X'ed.

Subject: CD ROM as virus protection

I do not know the current state-of-the-art, but it seems to me that by
acquiring software via CD-ROM will eliminate virus occurances.  At
least, there is someone to hold responsible, namely, the distributer.
Is it practical to expect this to come about?  Would distributers take
the responsibility of guaranteeing their distributions of being
virus-free?

In this way, even if the disk changed hands, there is not much chance
of it being infected with a virus.  If you start with a clean system,
and use clean disks for all trabsfers to the computer, this would
eliminate alot of problems.

This is just a thought.  Any feedback?

A New Strategy for Computer Viruses

PREFACE

This  presentation  was prepared  for and  delivered to  the
"DPMA 4th Annual Virus and Security Conference" on March 14,
1991.

ABSTRACT

This presentation argues that it is time for a new  strategy
for dealing with computer viruses.  It  reviews  the present
strategy  and  suggests that it  was adopted before  we knew
whether or not viruses would be successful.  It  points  out
that this strategy is essentially "clinical."  That  is,  it
treats the  symptoms of the virus  without  directly dealing
with its growth and spread.

It presents evidence  that  at least  two  computer viruses,
Jerusalem  B and Stoned, are epidemic, that more  copies are
being created than are being killed.  It  argues that simply
the growth of the viruses, without regard to their symptoms,
is a problem.

It  argues  that  it  is now  time  for  an  epidemiological
approach to viruses.  A keystone of such an approach will be
the  massive  and pervasive use of  vaccine programs.  These
programs are  characterized  by  being  resident, automatic,
getting  control  early,  and  acting  to  resist  the  very
execution of the virus program.

The presentation notes that there is significant  resistance
to  such a  strategy and, specifically, to  the  use of such
programs.  It  addresses  many  of  the  arguments  used  to
justify   this  resistance.  It   concludes   that  we  will
ultimately be forced to such a strategy, but that, given the
growth of  the  viruses and the resistance to  stragtegy, we
will not likely act on a timely basis.
