Subject: Worm / Virus on BITnet??? (IBM VM/CMS)

Hello,

I just found an item called GAME2 MODULE in my readerlist. My
readerlist display says that it comes from LISTSERV AT DEARN but when
peeking into the file the status line says it is from ERDAL AT TRMETU.
I sent a mail to that address but haven't got any response yet. I
haven't had contact to that userid before and so I am a bit suspicious
it could be some kind of virus or net worm.

Could anybody give me a hint, what to do now? Please mail to my userid
as I am not a subscriber of valert-l.

Any help is appreciated.

There just came a message from erdal at trmetu, it says that game2 module
is a trojan!!!!

Early on, a signature for the "Stoned 2" (or "Stoned II") was
circulated that in fact occurred in the normal Stoned virus.  Because
of this, at least one scanner would report both Stoned and Stoned II
when scanning a disk with the usual Stoned on it.  I suspect that's

Hm, interesting.  The Stoned infects the master boot record
(synonymous with "partition table") on the first physical hard drive
(BIOS drive id "80" hex).  In your case, that's the master boot record
on the 80Mb hard disk.  The master boot record (and therefore the
partition table) are stored at the very bottom of the disk, lower than
any of the partitions (E F G and H).

Did you test whether or not, after booting from a clean floppy and
then switching to E: and back to A:, the virus was actually *active*
(infecting new diskettes), as well as being in memory?  My guess would
be that, although the virus code was in memory (in the buffer used by
DOS to hold the partition table of the hard drive), the virus was not
active (that is, not hooked into INT 13, and never actually getting
control passed to it).  That is, after step <4> I would suggest that,
although the virus was in memory, it wasn't actually -doing- anything.
(Memory scanning in general has the problem that it can't tell an
active virus from a "ghost" of the virus that just happens to be
sitting in a buffer somewhere, never running).  The only way the usual
Stoned virus can get control is if it's present on the boot record or
the disk or diskette that the system is booted from.

That's not really very likely (unless what was downloaded was a
disk-image that the person then booted from); the Stoned and Joshi
viruses are both boot-sector infectors only.  You can only become
infected by either of them by booting from an infected diskette (or,
in theory, by running a program that "injects" them onto your disk; no
such program has ever been reported, though).  You might (f you
haven't already) scan all diskettes in the neighborhood that the
machine might have accidentally been booted from (even "non-system"
diskettes can be infected); you might find the source more accurately
that way (or you might not; source-tracing succeeds depressingly
rarely).  DC

This is not very likely.  Most modern defen(s|c)e contracts provide
reliability targets which the contractor must warrant, or include

This is entirely concievable, but fairly unlikely.  The coordination
required to pull this off would be immense.  The more people that
handle a secret, the less likely it is to remain one...

Not entirely correct.  Weapons software is often incredibly complex.
It also often loadable.  I assume that you are assuming that it is
ROM'd which is not neccessarily correct in newer, more complex sys-
tems.  The code is usually handled by fairly physically secure means,
but anything is possible.  NEVER say never....

The self-destruct systems are usually seperate, independent systems,
developed to be reliable, and, hence, simple.  They are not present in
production weapons.  Maintenance modes/codes might fall into this
category, but almost always require a hardware action to enable them
(switch closure, special connector, etc.) for this very reason.

All within the realm of possibility, but logistically unlikely.  More
likely is that the French know well the weaknesses of the sensor sys-
tems on their weapons, and can effectively exploit them. Ditto the
British, US, and others.

Generally true, but the Ira(q|k)is are not fools.  While their overall
technological base is not great, they do have some extremely competent
people.  Given the potential for treachery of this sort, I would ex-
pect that they would have considered the possibility and taken the
steps that their resources and needs would support.

I we assume (dangerous) that the premise is correct, the French could
not predict the USS Stark incident (which incidentally was fired byIra(q|k) NOT
 Iran, but did happen during the war period, and whose ac-
cident status is questioned almost as often as the USS America inci-
dent is).   Further there is a risk/return issue.  To save British
ships, the (postulated) secret would have have to spread further, AND
would eliminate the weapon as an option should Britain and France go
head to head.  While this is unlikely, anything is possible.  Conser-
vative military thinkers always strive to preserve options. Paraphras-

Subject: STONED and NON-bootable floppies (PC)

I got this message from one of our LAN administrators today.  I suspect

===========================================================================

I learned something new about the STONED virus today.  One of our users' PCs
was infected by the STONED virus by attempting to boot from a NON-bootable
diskette that was infected!

All MS/DOS diskettes (bootable and non-bootable) have a sector reserved
for the boot code (the boot sector).  I was under the impression that the
DOS boot code had to be present (bootable) in order for the STONED virus
to move itself to the hard disk.  This was an incorrect assumption.

This is what happened this morning:

1)	Non-Bootable disk left in A: by mistake
2)	System was rebooted
3)	"Your PC has been Stoned"
4)	"Non-System disk ... Remove and strike any key"
5)	SCAN shows virus in boot sector of non-bootable floppy disk
6)	SCAN shows virus in boot sector of C:

*** It might be a good idea to start SCANing non-bootable floppy disks !!!
===========================================================================
===========================================================================

After I got this message I dropped him a note asking whether he knew
scan worked on non-bootable floppies.  He indicated that it does.

My 8088 based PC became infected with the [Stoned] virus on Christmas Day.  At

I used the DOS FDISK and FORMAT programs and unfortunately that didn't solve
the problem either.  When I ran a McAfee's SCAN program, it detected the virus
still on the system.  However, the only problem that was manifesting itself was
the inability to load RAMDRIVE on bootup.  The error message -

	RAMDRIVE:Insufficient memory

kept appearing.

In the end I never did find out where the infection came from.  Several
floppies were also infected, but that could have been as a result of
interaction with the hard drive when copying files, etc.

Finally, I took the following steps and that seemed to get rid of it:

1. I opened the boot sector/partition table of the hard disk with NORTON
   UTILITIES and overwrote the entire disk area with a value of "0" manually.

2. I used the NORTON INTEGRATOR WIPEDISK program to wipe the hard disk three
   times with a value of "0".

3. I then re-partitioned the hard disk and reformatted with DOS FORMAT /v/s.

4. I have created a SAFE BOOT disk by copying my original system files (DOS
   3.3) onto a floppy and write protected it.  I placed an AUTOEXEC.BAT file on
   it that restricts the path to SET PATH=A:\  I use it when I am running a
   floppy for the first time or of questionable origin by rebooting the
   computer with SAFE BOOT and running the McAfee SCAN program from drive "B:"
   (I have two floppy drives).

   If I find a floppy with a virus (particularly [Stoned]) on it, I open it's
   boot sector with write protected NORTON UTILITIES disks, overwrite it with a
   value of "0", copy each individual file over to a scanned and clean floppy,
   and format the infected floppy.  Then I scan the second floppy to ensure
   that the virus didn't transfer in the file copying and perform DISKCOPY to
   restore the original floppy.

   So far this method seems to have kept my hard drive virus free.

5. This is a poor man's way of virus protection.  Very cumbersome, but I do not
   want to have to go through an emergency backup of the hard disk again!

Hope this helps.  Good luck to your friend.

That's true, but the "additional hardware" can be as simple as a very
small spst switch wired across wire No. 6 of the HD controller ribbon
cable.  It will effectively stop ANY and ALL disk writes without
interfering with any other computer processes. Not even a DOS error

But yes they do have it: it's called the changeline. I have a little
continuous formatting program which senses when a diskette has been
inserted and automatically starts the format operation without any

No! It does not "definitely have to be a virus".  Just as with all
hardware the floppy drive mechanism can be mal-aligned.  So, if the
part of the drive that checks to see if the disk is locked is not in
the correct position is may 'sense' the disk is locked, uncorrectly.

it on an ID with no user files)"

I hope this information can help anyone trying to trace the worm.

Yes, but to do this, it has to keep the drive in question selected all
the time, drive motor running. Would you really want to have drive A:
going all the time your computer was up? And how could the program
check if a disk was inserted in another drive (only one drive can be
active at a time)?

Not that I'm trying to give anyone ideas, but: Does there exist a
virus or whatever that attacks TSRs?  For example, If I have device
drivers or memory managers resident, the virus either interferes with
them or attaches itself to them or <insert scenario>.  Just curious,
haven't a report of one or suspecting one.
