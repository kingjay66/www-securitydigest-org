diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,

	I read that Infoworld article. Like many readers, I'm sure,
I got a chuckle out of it. A lot of us are aware that media
articles dated 1 April should be regarded with a grain of salt
[like the story one year about Big Ben going digital]. Personally, I
regard such articles as a refreshing and harmless sign of creativity.
	As a non-American, I find your comment to be a classic
glimpse into the litigious nature of US society.
	Go ahead with your lawsuit. I suspect it will be thrown out
of court.

Given the usual definition of a virus (i.e. Cohen's formal definition
of a virus as roughly stated by spaf@cs.purdue.edu (Gene Spafford))
as: "code that makes a (possibly modified) copy of itself in another
program" and assuming that Ethan was serious about "cp $0 ." being a
virus.

How is "cp $0 ." a virus?  On my systems all that will do is copy your
Current Shell Interpreter (CSI) to your current directory. In my case
that was the same as doing "cp /bin/sh .". I see no way that could be
considered a virus. This is not even a security risk in and of itself.
It WOULD be a security risk if:
	1) your local superuser had "." before "/DIR" in their PATH/path
		(where "/DIR" is the path of the directory where the CSI is)
because if:
	1) you do the "cp $0 ."
	2) you change your copy of the CSI to add malicious code
	3) you get your local superuser to go into your home directory as root
		and run your copy of the CSI
you could get full root privileges (assuming your malicious code did this) and
this IS a security breach.

I had a method which used to work pretty well - it even stopped the
'TRYOUT' program in Dr. Solomon's package, which made a direct JMP to
F000:xxxx, but some of the most recent viruses are able to bypass it.
I guess they would be able to defeat your friend's method as

A few viruses do - very few, but they exist - yes.

I know of no virus which bothers with the checksum - but I would
rather suggest you put an invalid checksum there - perhaps compute the
"correct" checksum and XOR it with your initials (or something) - even
if the virus computes a new checksum, it will be incorrect.  If the
virus ignores the checksum it will also be incorrect.  However - this
will not be of any use against "stealth" viruses.

Subject: Troubles... (PC)

Hi,
  This may be a little out of this list, but I'm having troubles on my
PC.  I believe it must be a virus. When I swap a MS-DOS disk in drive
A: (or in drive B:), and ask for a dir or for a file, it verifies the
disk, but keeps giving me the dir and treats the disk as if it was the
first one I had in the drive. This limits me to only two disks each
time I turn the machine on, and if I swap a disk and write to it, DOS
writes to it as if it was using the first disk, and crashing the info
of the second disk.
  Has anybody had a similar experience? I'm not using any kind of
Diskcaching or something like that, and by using the vaccines I have
(pro-scan, scan100, devirus and m-jrslem), they say there's nothing
wrong with any of my disks.
  Does anybody have a vaccine against this? Since I'm not subscribed
to the list, I'd appreciate a lot if you could mail me directly.
Thanks.

Subject: Version 76C of McAfee anti-virals for MS-DOS (PC)

Now available from SIMTEL20:

pd1:<msdos.trojan-pro>
NETSCN76.ZIP    Network compatible - scan for 240 viruses, v76
SCANV76C.ZIP    VirusScan, scans disk files for 239 viruses
VSHLD76C.ZIP    Resident virus infection prevention program

VIRUSCAN
     Version 76C of VIRUSCAN adds 18 new viruses, bringing the total
number of known computer viruses to 239, for a total of 501 viruses
including strains.  The enclosed VIRLIST.TXT file outlines the
characteristics of the new viruses.  For a comprehensive discussion of
each of the viruses, we recommend that you access the VSUM document
copyrighted by Patricia Hoffman.  It is available on most bulletin
board systems.
     In addition, two new command line options have been added to
improve batch mode operation of SCAN: The /NOPAUSE option turns off
the screen pause that occurs when SCAN fills up a screen with
messages.  The /NOBREAK option will prevent SCAN from stopping when a
Control-C or Control-Break is issued.

VSHIELD
     Version 76C has been completely re-structured to provide a
major increase in the execution speed.  Version 76C will run twice
as fast as previous versions.  The amount of time added to program
loads will now be cut in half.
     Version 76C of VSHIELD adds 18 new viruses, bring the number
of discrete computer viruses detected to 239 and the number of
variants to 501 viruses.
     Version 76C of VSHIELD adds two new options, /WINDOWS
option and /CHKHI.  When run with the /WINDOWS option, VSHIELD
will intercept viruses in DOS processes under Microsoft Windows.
The /CHKHI command allows the scanning of the high memory area
present on 286 and 386 machines.

NETSCAN
     NETSCAN Version 76 (note no "C" version) adds nineteen new
viruses.  For a listing of complete listing of viruses, refer to the
VIRLIST.TXT file.
     Version 76 of NETSCAN adds a critical error handler that allows
NETSCAN to continue scanning if a file-open error occurs.  For more
information about the /UNATTEND option, see the COMMANDS section.

NOTE:  For Version 76 of the documents, the synopsis of new
       viruses that usually appears was removed for space
       reasons.  I'd like to know if people would prefer to
       have a brief listing (1/2 page) of the viruses in the
       documentation or not.  Please respond by email.

CLEAN-UP
     The CLEAN-UP program V76 has a bug in it.  Please continue to use
V75.  A fix for V76 will be out next week.  If you have CLEAN76.ZIP
please delete it.

Subject: "Empire" virus (PC)

Tim Martin at the University of Alberta was kind enough to forward to
me this new virus. First reported as a STONED variant examination has
produced a considerable number of variants from the traditional
STONED.

This alert is a result of a disassembly performed on the boot sector
of an infected floppy. Since the sector containingthe disply message
was not included this text is not available, however examination
indicates that this second sector (trk 0 hd 1 sector 3 on floppy)
contains only text.

Listing follows:

Virus Name:  EMPIRE
Aliases:
V Status:    New
Discovery:   April, 1991
Symptoms:    Memory reduction, possible floppy failures, Messages
Origin:      Alberta Canada (?)
Eff. Length: N/A
Type Code:   BPRtS (Boot and Partition table infector - Resident TOM - Stealth)
Detection:   CHKDSK, F-DISKINF, DISKSECURE (SCAN v76C does not pick this up)
Removal:     Cold boot from clean, write-protected floppy, replace MBR (FD) or
             Boot Record (Floppy) see text.
General Comments: On first look, the virus appears similar to the STONED but
       There are notable differences: a "cute" at the start will throw a
       researcher off if a standard STONED opening is expected. The virus
       consists of two sectors - the first which replaces the MBR on a fixed
       disk and the BR on a floppy, contains the executable code. The
       second sector contains the display message- I have not seen this as
       yet but it is said to refer to the USA as the "evil empire" and
       makes reference to the war with Iraq. This sector has a trivial
       encryption scheme to defeat text examination.

       When active in a PC, total memory will be reduced by 2048 bytes
       (CHKDSK will return 653312 "total bytes memory" on a 640k machine)

       A "stealth" mechanism is employed by the virus so that an examination
       of the MBR will fail when the virus is active in memory since
       any request for the MBR will be intercepted by the virus and the
       real MBR will be returned. Similarly, any attempt to write to the
       MBR will be changed to a reset by the virus.

       No message is displayed at boot-up, rather display is a function of
       a trigger based on the real time clock during operation.

       On a floppy disk the original boot record is stored on track 0 head 1
       sector 2 and the message is stored on the next sector. High density
       floppies may exhibit failures as a result of this. Low density floppies
       with over 80 directory entries may also have problems. These can
       occur even long after the floppy is disinfected if the directory is
       not restored.

       The original MBR on a fixed disk is stored on cyl 0 head 0 sector 6
       with the message on the next sector. Normally, this should be in
       the "hidden sector" area but a disk without "hidden sectors" will
       probably experience FAT failures.

       Signature scanning should reveal the virus when booted from a clean
       floppy disk using the string "A3 08 7C A1 13 04 48".

John Gantz's Infoworld article on the bogus AF/91 virus resulted in
overburdened but concerned Navy computer users calling our office for
assistance.  To some the article's closing statement, "The meaning of
the AF/91 designation: 91 is the Julian Date for April Fool's Day.",

supposed virus.

Mr.  Gantz was unavailable for comment when we contacted his office.
However, the editorial staff at Infoworld indicated they had received
a number of calls regarding this article and were reevaluating
publishing similar articles in the future.

Subject: AF/91 - John Gantz "joke" in Infoworld

In the April 1, 1991 issue of Infoworld, John Gantz  in  his  column  "Tech
Street" warned of a virus called "AF/91" which he said was developed by the
NSA  to be used against Iraqi defense computers. After describing the virus
and telling that it started spreading uncontrolled, he told that  windowing
technology  was  "doomed."  In  the  same  issue, columnist Robert Cringely
discussed Windows 3.0 vulnerability to viruses saying it "has lots of holes
for custom viruses to slip through."

In the April 8 issue, Mr. Gantz's  column  begins  with  a  note  from  the
Editors  saying  AF/91  was  all an April Fools joke. I'm not laughing. I'm
searching for the adjectives to describe  this  irresponsible  act.  Anyone

........................................
In reply to these, I say this. Jokes can only be allowed to go so far.  Too
often  people  try  to cap each other's jokes and go too far and cause much
unfunny nuisance. Ref what someone in my scubadiving club said after a bout
of trouble: "Practical jokes: they occur in the Army, and sooner  or  later
[they  lead  to]  violence.". April Foolism, in the computer virus field as
elsewhere,  like  other  hoaxes,  waste  time  and  attention;  they  cause
annoyance;  much time can be wasted; people miss things and drive miles and
raise alerts. OK, if carefully read the hoax  is  clear.  But  busy  people
haven't  always  got the time and attention to spare to study everything in
depth. Ref e.g. the amount of hoaxes that are  believed  despite  including
the  giveaway  supposed name "Lirpa Loof". And serious matter does arise on
April 1st as on other days. On April 1st computer users have  enough  extra
to  cope  with  having to beware of the various viruses and logic bombs etc
that silly other people set to 'go off' on April 1st. And serious  messages
published on April 1st are sometimes taken as hoaxes. Enough nuisance. (One
common  example  is  joke  April  1st messages such as "Ring Mr.C.Lion" and
"Ring Mr.L.E.Fant" and "Ring Mr.G.Raff" etc, and the phone number given  is
a  zoo's. Not very funny for switchboard girls at zoos getting thousands of
junk phone calls every April 1st on top of  their  usual  work,  and  zoos'
switchboards  are blocked, unfunny nuisance unlimited.) Responsible editors
should exclude hoaxes on April 1st as on other days,  and  take  the  usual
action  against the authors of any that get part them into reputable print.

I'm almost amazed that you were so taken in by Gantz' article.  I will
admit to reading the article with some interest initially, but it
became clear that it was a farce towards the end.  I have a lot of
respect for the folks at NSA, but they play by the same laws of
physics and math that the rest of us do, and I seem to remember some
claims toward the end of the article that grossly violated both.  The
final "nail in the coffin" was the date of the issue (April 1,1991).
I wish I had the issue in front of me so I could quote chapter and
verse, but I don't.

I'm sorry that you were so effectively taken in, but please don't
yield to the litigous impulses you are feeling.  There's too much of
that in this country, and the lawyers are the only ones who win
anyway.

Hello,

Does anyone out there have information on the Yankee Doodle virus?  F-PROT
1.14 reports some files infected with "Yankee (TP-44)".  I would like to
know:

   1.  What does the TP-44 mean?

   2.  How does it spread?  I know it is memory resident, but once
in memory, does it attack .EXE and .COM files when they are executed, or
search the disk and randomly attach itself to executable files?

   3.  What are the symptoms?  (Note: this particular strain does NOT play
Yankee Doodle on the speaker when I set the system clock to 5:00, nor when
I reboot, as some Y.D. strains are reported to do.)

F-PROT has been quite effective in getting rid of the virus, but I would
like to know more about it.

That's what WDEF viruses do on the Macintosh - they transfer from the
"desktop" file of the infected floppy to the host.  However, they are
also extremely easy to kill, and don't do any real damage, so they are
not (yet) seen as a big threat.

Unfortunately, Bruce, if the script is going to spread, it has to get
past the scripts in the HOME card of HC.  Passing the message directly
to HC does not bypass the HOME scripts.
