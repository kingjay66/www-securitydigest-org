"Bloomingtom" is another name for the "NOINT", a "stealthy" MBR and
boot sector infector. Not a very nice virus, if you ask for the
partition table you are likely to get garbage. If DOS gets garbage,
bye,bye disk.

CHKDSK will report 2k less "total bytes memory" (640k usu reports
655360 - 653 or less is a danger sign).

This is actually a very bad idea for IDE hard disk drives. Since these
drives have an on-drive controller specialized for controlling that
particular drive, it usually also has the ability to fumble with odd
drive geometry. For example, manufacturers may place more sectors in the
outer region of the surface than in the inner region while the drive
geometry seen externally (i.e. for software) appears straightforward
with a fixed number of sectors per track. As a result:

One should never, repeat: NEVER, low-level format an IDE drive!

By incident, a friend of mine just has a virus on one of the "dead"
sectors and no virus scanner available to delete this virus. :-(
Does anybody in Netland know a virus scanner that handles these odd
viruses and repairs IDE drives?

Writing virus scanners which have to cope with the problem of
already-resident viri is an unnecessary complication. It could be
done, of course, but it just means more work for the programmers,
*and* it would not be fail-safe. Remember just how many viri there
actually _are_ out there [no comments about names and classification,
please ;-)]. Writing the code to disable each one of them, restore all
the interrupts they hook, reclaim memory, etc. is superfluous when all
you have to do is stick in a clean floppy, and press the reset
button....

If you boot off a clean floppy, you avoid all these problems.

All PC's with hard drives have floppy drives, and if they don't, they should.

Subject: DIR-2 vs CLEANv84 (PC)

Hi|

My computer catch an DIR-2 virus, and I try to clean it with McAffe's
CLEAN v 84. And what I saw ?
1) SCAN and CLEAN ignore last sectors on disk, so virus live
   normally there.
2) CLEAN can not clean DIR-2, it can only DESTROY (erase) all
   infected files.
So, when I scan an empty disk with DIR-2 virus, SCAN tell me
that all is right. When I have virus in system CLEAN erase all
my .exe and .com files and DO NOT CLEAN MY DISK.
It is rather abnormally situation, is't it ?
Virus was cleaned with DIR2CURE.COM by Marek Sell.

The same person (alias: Ahmed Dogan) at the same time posted source
code of the following viruses:

DIR-2, The Diamond Virus, Darth Vader, MG 3 and Anti-Pascal version AP-400.

The source of the last one is a really good disassembly prepared by
Vesselin Bontchev in July 1990. It contains copyright note and remark:

"This listing is only to be made available to virus researchers
 or software writers on a need-to-know basis."

I do not claim that Vesselin has made his disassembly available to
persons like "Ahmed Dogan" or Todor Todorov. It is just an example
that the distribution of virus source among even the most "trusted
researchers" is never safe. Maybe some day I will see in some public
forum my own disassembly.

The problem is more general: how to organize safe and effective
cooperation between different anti-virus centers? How to decide which
anti-virus center is a real responsible anti-virus laboratory,
especially in countries which authorities do not care about the
problem, where victims of Anti-Telephonica or Disk Killer are talking
about practical jokes instead of crimes? Poland is not bad example of
such a country.

  If you have an IBM PS/2 line, then some user might have set the
hardware password.  If this is the case, all you need to do is open
the case, and look for a small jumper (I believe in the back).  Just
move this to the "reset password" position, and the machine should
boot up like normal.  I think that if you leave this jumper in this
position, the machine will automatically reset the password each time
it is powered up, so no password will be able to be set.

  If this is a clone motherboard, I believe you can reset the CMOS
back to the factory defaults by holding down the [INSERT] key while
turning the system on.  (I think it's the insert key, may be the
[DELETE] key...)

  Hope this helps!!

Good question. I have two programs, BOOTID and CHECKOUT, both free
(BOOTID source is also free), designed specifically for such cases,
i.e. someone has a suspicious boot sector and wants identification of
it without the risk of broadcasting the entire boot sector in any way
that could result in "the wrong people" reconstituting a live virus.

Both programs are available via anonymous ftp from:
cantva.canterbury.ac.nz [IP address: 132.181.30.3] in the pc
directory, or newton.phys.canterbury.ac.nz [132.181.40.1] in the
pub/local directory.  The BOOTID program generates a relatively short
"ID number" for the boot sector, which people with a collection of
viruses, plus the program, can use to identify the virus, or to at
least get an idea of what general type of boot sector it is (in the
case of new viruses or valid-but-strange boot sectors). I'm still
interested in comments on the program, by the way, and almost have
enough to make it worth writing a new version. (At that stage I'd be
happy to see the program on many ftp sites).

CHECKOUT can do everything that BOOTID can, plus has the ability to
give quite a bit of information about the boot sector, including a
description (giving reasons why it thinks the boot sector is good or
bad). But, like any heuristic, be careful not to assign too much
significance to its conclusions. The part that does a reverse-assemble
and tries to work out register contents at the time of interrupt calls
is downright buggy - I include it in CHECKOUT at the moment only
because it is of some help as it stands, so long as people understand
enough to ignore some of what this part of the program says! Checkout
also can look up a database of "known" hashcodes, and give the
conventional name for a virus, or at least the closest virus in the
database... but (again) that bit in the version that's publicly
released needs improving.

In case you missed my earlier postings on the subject, the "boot id's"
created are of a form where the first part tries to assign a unique
number to the basic contents of the diskette's boot sector, ignoring
changes in size & serial number but otherwise sensitive to the
slightest version/generation change; the last part of the code tries
to identify what the boot sector is doing - indicating family
relationships, etc. It is possible to get an idea of what the boot
sector is up to simply by looking carefully at the code (or applying
CHECKOUT to the code produced by BOOTID on somebody else's machine).

It is possible to create a boot sector which isn't a virus but still
gets reported by CHECKOUT as "probably a virus", although it would
definately be strange and contrived. Some valid, non-bootable,
diskettes do get a "seems strange" warning, especially those that
deliberately try to look like infected diskettes to avoid viruses
infecting them.  It is possible, but difficult, to make a virus that
CHECKOUT thinks is normal.  It is also possible, but very, very
difficult, to make such a virus get the same identification code as
some known, genuine DOS diskette. And even if someone does waste their
time doing that, such viruses can still be caught by true virus
detectors (in fact, something required to get around one test would
make the virus even easier to spot by at least one type of virus
detector, so I don't mind making the source of BOOTID free to everyone
- - but I don't want to say any more on why any virus specially written
to fool the program would be easy to spot by some methods!)

The aim of H(ash)codes is to assign names to boot sectors (viruses and
good ones) for which no other knowledge is required. Many present
names are based on somebody's idea of a good name, e.g. where it was
discovered, or a word from a message that one version produces. With
my program, you get a name for a BSI virus given only the diskette and
the program, and people on the other side of the world can arrive at
the same name for the same virus. The only problem is that some
mutating viruses can get lots of different names, which is a nuisance,
but then the "family" part of the identification is helpful. That's
one of the areas I'd like comments on - whether to increase the
"family" part of the code.

If anyone wants to chat about the technique, or the extension of the
code to non-BSI viruses (which is possible, but a lot of work), feel
free to e-mail me.  Certainly I am happy for others to include the
naming scheme in their software, so long as they ask first (in case
there's a better version to include).

Vesselin has noted the publishing, on the unmoderated "VIRUS" echo on
Fionet (not to be comfused with the moderated "VIRUS_INFO" and
"*WARNINGS*" echoes) source code for five previously known viri.

Although this is a blow, thanks to Tim Martin I have been able to test
all five against SCAN 85, VIRx 1.8 (by the way, Ross, where/when is
1.9?), FPROT 2.01 and TBSCAN 2.8 with the VS911009 signatures.  All
programs will identify the viral code produced, with the exception of
TBSCAN, which does not identify the DIR-II/Creeping Death code.

                        Hardware damage

The myth of viral programs damaging hardware seems to be one of
the more enduring.  *No viral program yet found has been
designed to damage hardware, and THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANY
CONFIRMED CASE OF A VIRAL PROGRAM DIRECTLY CAUSING PHYSICAL
DAMAGE TO COMPUTER HARDWARE.*  Is that plain enough?

It *is* possible for certain pieces of hardware to be damaged by
software or programming.  To the best knowledge of the
international virus research community, no such programming
(with the exception of low level formatting, see below) has ever
been found on an existing virus "in the wild."

Monitors - certain older types of monitors (notably early IBM
mono graphics adapters) could be made to "freeze" the sweep of
the electron beam, and thus "burn in" a section of the screen
phosphors.  No one has ever burned a hole in a monitor, nor have
they ever caused one to overheat and "blow up" with software.

Power supplies - cannot be addressed by software.  No one has
ever "melted down" a power supply with software.

Printers - as with any physical device can be damaged by getting
them to do any one thing for too long.  This, of course, depends
upon the machine running unattended for a long time.

Drives - some drives can be damaged by "pushing" the heads
beyond normal limits.  On others, this is a good way to find
more disk space.  Certain drives can be damaged by having the
heads "seek" back and forth at a resonant frequency.  (Usually
older drives, for mainframes, are more susceptible to this.
There is also a story, likely apocryphal, that one computer
company set up a "portable" computer, including banks of disk
drives, in a semi-trailer for demos.  The first time the truck
took a turn with all the drives running, it flipped over due to
the enormous stored angular momentum of the spinning platters.)

IDE controllers and drives do not allow for the normal calls to
low level format the drive.  If such a call is made, the results
are uncertain.  The drive will not be formatted, but it will not
be left in a usable state.  IDE drive manufacturers have not, in
the past, shipped programs for low level formatting, and so a
call for a low level format on an IDE drive has been, to the
normal user, no different than hardware damage.  As this has
become known in the user community, more IDE manufacturers have
been shipping the formatting programs.

Hardware damage by software is possible, but extremely rare.
