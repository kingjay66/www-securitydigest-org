Subject: Vshield not loading into high memory? (PC)

Has anyone tried to load vshield (version 3.9B80) into high memory?
I've tried MS-DOS 5.0 and Dr. DOS 5.0 and 6.0 BETA and nothing seems
to work.  MS-DOS doesn't load it at all and DR. DOS just loads it into
conventional memory.

   I have tried it with many configurations on different machines.
Any help would be appreciated.  Could someone please forward this to
Mcaffee..<<

I use DOS 5.0 & QEMM 5.13 - no luck here either...  What I have done is
created a small (default 64K) ramdisk with the /e (use extended
memory) that I copy it to & load from there with the /swap option.
According to Manifest, this shrinks it down to 3.2K resident in the DOS
640...

FYI, I can't get it to load high even if it's the only thing I'm
loading...  Maybe with the new QEMM 6.0..!?

Did you, purchance, run SCAN with the /AV (if I remember correctly)
switch?  The one that adds self-checking code to the target file, and
would therefore confuse NAV's *own* self check?

>>What disassembler do you use?

I have a disassembler specifically for scrutinising boot sectors,
which is part of the CHECKOUT program I wrote. It is free, and a bit
buggy, I'm afraid. I made CHECKOUT available a while ago - I'm working
on a new version & will announce when it's available; in the mean
time, the way to use the old version is:
   CHECKOUT/A A:
and you might want the /D switch as well. What it does is work out
what parts of the code get executed, what are the contents of
registers at the time of interrupt calls (okay, this bit is pretty
buggy), and puts in labels and BPB structure if appropriate, etc.

Well sometime this year or last I called the VB, to ask how to use the
strings.  What I thought the person who I spoke to said was that you
just have to start scanning from the entry point forward.  Either I
misunderstood or he misspoke.

Sure you can find the string by scanning the whole file.  I thought
that significant time could be saved by scanning starting from entry
point.  I was wrong.  Are "turbo modes" in virus scanners a mis-feature?

Viruses are more widespread, and common, in the PC world.  If you

Subject: False Positives in General

     There have been many notes to this forum, many of them
recently, on false positives of various sorts.  I think that a
taxonomy of viral false positives is indicated.  I would suggest
that the following major classes of false positive reports from
anti-viral programs be defined:

1.  Signature scan hits from anti-viral programs on anti-viral
programs.

     Signature scan hits occur when one anti-viral program detects
a viral signature that was used by another anti-viral program.
These can only occur if two or more anti-viral programs are being
used.  The species would appear to be:

1.1  Signature found on disk.  Reports that VIRUCIDE.EXE contains
the 12 Tricks Trojan fall into this species.

1.2  Signature found in active memory, in use by a TSR virus
checker.

1.3  Signature found in released memory, typically by a scanner.

     Class 1 false positives indicate that the anti-viral program
generating the false positive is working correctly.  They may
indicate a vulnerability in the program being reported against,
such as that it fails to clear memory or fails to encrypt its
strings.  They would be much more common except that anti-viral
scanners usually encrypt their signature strings, partly to protect
against Class 1 false positives.

2.   Ghost hits from incompletely deleted virus fragments.

     Class 2 false positives occur when a viral infection has
previously occurred and has been corrected in a particular way.
The jump to the viral code has been corrected without overwriting
the viral fragment.  The viral fragment is physically present on
the disk but has been deactivated.  A Class 2 false positive
similarly indicates that the anti-viral program is working
correctly.

3.   True false alarms.

     A Class 3 false positive occurs when a viral infection is
detected but there is no viral infection and no deliberate presence
of a viral signature.  (The viral signatures used by a virus
scanner are deliberate.)  A Class 3 false positive indicates that
the anti-viral program is "erring on the side of safety" but is an
error.

     The frequency of false positives is a reason why (as Padgett
Peterson says repeatedly) anti-viral software should not be used
ignorantly.  If a positive alarm occurs, expert analysis is
required.

     Further comments on classification of false positives are
welcomed.

Subject: Re: Virus Simulator available (PC)

There is a conflict between the need to contain the spread of computer
viruses and the need for end users to be able to test the efficacity
of the anti-viral policies and procedures that they have established.

Clearly the "bait files" produced by the recently released "Virus
Simulator" are not reliable indicators since any actual alarms caused
by them are, by definition false alarms.

Let me propose that some agreed upon file name such as "VIRTEST.TXT"
be defined by all anti-viral products as a test file and be identified
as being such using the same mechanisms that are used to report a true
viral infection, but using text that indicates that this is indeed a
test, not a real virus.

Disinfection of "VIRTEST.TXT" would consist in appending a line
containing as a minimum a time stamp and the name and version number
of the program performing the "disinfection".

This approach would provide a standard method for users to cause
the products to return ERRLEVELs indicating viruses, and to practice
disinfection. It would also remove the temptation to use something
other than live viruses to evaluate competing products.

Comments?

Ha-ha.. It cannot be more false... Those that use Macs only live in a
paradise - only about 30 viruses are known for these computers.
Compare this to the about 800 known ones for PCs... :-(

Hmm, this also won't tell the users how good their anti-virus product
really it... because the manifacturer will make sure that the product
detects the test files. :-)

A slightly different idea. How about a set of programs that simulate
not virus behaviour (i.e., they do not spread), or virus signatures
(what a rubish!), but the ways that viruses use to (1) install
themselves in memory, (2) the ways they get control, and (3) the ways
they write on the disk. This will provide a good tool to test "memory
displaying tools" (e.g. MAPMEM), or monitoring programs and hardware
(e.g., FluShot+, ThunderByte). Currently I have identified about a
dozen ways to install a program in memory and about the same number of
ways to get control. The number of ways to write on the disk are at
least twice as many. Now I just have to implement all these... :-)

The best disassembler is your own brain, aided by DEBUG. I don't

It would be a good idea to quote some names and how much professional
experience do these people have in the anti-virus field indeed.
Currently I've not seen even one positive oppinion from the most
well-known anti-virus researchers...

I can't believe that F-Fchk has reported your simulation file to be
INFECTED by any virus. Please, check again. Doesn't it report
"possibly infected", "new variant of..", etc.? Does it try to
disinfect you file? And does it succeed? No, I definitvely can't
believe that.

First of all, they do not need any virus simulator (or live viruses),
in order to test the speed and easy of use of any anti-virus product.
Second, the speed cannot be tested on ONE file only; you need huge
amount of files to obtain a reliable average number. Third, any user
(not only the administrators) is able to test the speed and easy of
use of ANY product (including the anti-virus ones), WITHOUT having any
kind of viruses - live or simulated. Reference: Prof. Harold
Highland's article "How to test a computer virus without a virus" in
Computers & Security. Don't have the exact reference right now, but I
think that Prof. Hoghland is reading Virus-L, so he could supply more
info.

That's good, but as Frisk pointed out, the performence of an
anti-virus product in a real-life situation has nothing to do with its
ability to detect your simulator.

This is a serious and yet unsolved problem, indeed. My oppinion is
that such collection should be a vailable at some central organization
(VTC?, CERT?, NIST?, NCSC?), and this organization should perform an
objective test of different anti-virus products.

Again, I'm waiting for some names. The feedback that you received in
this forum (which I consider as highly professional) seems
overwhelmingly negative...

I think you'll find epidemiological data hard to come by on any
ony platform; a *lot* of places hush up viral infections. I got some
calls from places which asked not to be named in reference to major
infection problems during the early days of Mac viruses.

>Where did the idea that Macs are riddled with viruses come from?  It's

It may stem from the fact that the Mac community immediately began
spreading the word as soon as the first viruses began circulating and
that Mac dealers, users, and support groups emphasize the value of
detecting viruses and preventing infections. The conclusion that
concern = amount of infection is seductive, but if one thinks about
it, the more care a population takes to avoid infection, the less
likely they are to have one...

One might also tend to think that this is another factoid on the order
of "the Mac is not a serious business machine", "the Mac is just a
game machine", etc., promulgated by thise who cannot conceive of any
machine other than an IBM PC as being an adequate tool in any way,
shape, or form.   :-)

But the original question was about whether viruses are more
*widespread* on Macs than on PCs, not whether there were more
different strains of virus.  It's certainly true that there are more
different viruses for PCs than for Macs.  But that doesn't tell us
whether or not there are more infected PCs than infected Macs, or a
higher percentage.  I'd be very interested in any data that anyone has
on that question.

(Remember: the vast majority of 'known' PC viruses have never been
known to infect a real user.  Is that also true for the Mac?)

Subject: Boot sectors

FUNBOT1.CVP   910902

                      Boot sector infectors

Every disk has a boot sector.  Most disks are not "bootable"
because they do not contain the necessary system files, but all
disks have a boot sector.  The boot sector is simply that place in
which the computer, by default, looks for the starting point of
the boot sequence.

In saying that every disk has a boot sector, I am using the term
"boot sector" in its most generic sense as being this initial
starting point.  In the MS-DOS environment, "boot sector" has a
more limited technical definition, and hard disks actually start
with a Master Boot Record rather than a boot sector.  In either
case, however, there is one spot which gives the computer some
definition of the disk, and information about the next step in the
boot sequence.

In most cases the boot sector does not point to a boot sequence,
because system files are not available on the disk.  In the case
of a bootable disk, the "bootable" sector points to the location
of files containing the programming necessary for input and output
activity and a program for the interpretation of operating system
commands.  A "data", or non-bootable, disk, however, may simply
contain information on the disk specification, and a small program
informing the system, or operator, that the disk is "non-system".

The important point, however, is that a program is there in the
boot sector, in every case.

The existence of a boot sector on every disk is the major strength
of boot sector infecting viral programs, and it is a psycological,
rather than technical, advantage.  Because a "data disk" does not
contain any recognizable "programming", it is often seen as
"safe".  If there is no program, then there is no program to
infect, right?  However, since there is, in fact, a "hidden"
program on the disk, it *can* be infected.

By and large, boot sector infectors "displace" the existing boot
sector, and move it to another location on the disk.  This means
that the viral program gets "first crack", and is able to install
itself in memory, and then passes control to the original boot
sector.  Thus the disk appears to behave normally, unless the
virus carries some visible payload.

In addition to the psychological advantage, "BSI"s have some
technical values as well.  For one thing, they get the first
chance at the system, before most "protection" has started.  For
another, a BSI, to be effective at all, must be memory resient.
For a third, because hy make changes to system areas which are
not normally seen, te changes are often undetected in normal
operation.
