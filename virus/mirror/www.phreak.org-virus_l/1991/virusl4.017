along with the action of randomly picking a location to kill with the

Subject: Problems installing F-PROT 1.14 (PC)

I encountered a small problem while I was installing f-prot 1.14.

When I tried f-flock *.* in my wordperfect directory, it couldn't lock
a number of files, one of them was wp.exe. Since this is the most used
file of wordperfect, it is important that it is kept locked. The error
message from f-flock looks something like 'unable to lock wp.exe,
invalid header'.

I'm using Wordperfect 5.1 dutch version. Anybody has an idea to solve
this problem

Thanks in advance
Christian

Subject: Anti-Viral Utilities (PC)

        For some time I have been debating whether or not to mention a
possibility concerning the spread of Partition Table/Boot Sector
infections lest anyone get ideas. Watching the postings lately leads
me to think that possibly it has already happened.

        In short, it would be trivial to write a trojan or virus that
would place a P-Table or BSI on a machine. At the moment, I suspect that
in the interest of speed, signature scanning routines only look for these
infections in memory and in the partition table and boot sector and not
inside executables.

        For this reason, I would suggest that people experiencing multiple
unexplainable infections utilize Mr. McAfee's new extension to SCAN and
check all executables for a random code sequence taken from such an
infection.

        As some of you know, I have been experimenting with anti-viral
routines implanted in the partition table of the fixed disk and have
become convinced that effective protection against malicious software
MUST include such programs. So far the technique has proven equally
effective against both "stealth" and non-"stealth" software.

        Used in conjunction with any number of authentication programs
specific to the operating system (is effective with MS-DOS, and should
be equally effective on an OS/2 or unix platform with an IBM-type
BIOS) it can detect (only hardware can block) infections carried on
the boot sector of a floppy immediately (before DOS loads), can block
any later attempt at infection of the partition table or boot sector,
and can provide an authenticatable path to the disk for other routines
loaded later.

        Interestingly, the technique started out as a password
protection scheme to protect fixed disks from intrusion. The full
capability just fell out in testing.

Subject: Virus Guidelines

Below are some draft virus guidelines we're chewing over at our site
(the University of Wyoming).  So far we've been real lucky and not had
a real problem with viruses; lately tho things have picking up. As
this list is very specific to our site, I'll stick explanatory notes
after some items.  I'm posting this for the benefit of those in
similar circumstances or to elicit comment from those who've already
been around the track a few times, as it were.  (I use "should be" and
"will be" below to distinguish between things that WILL be done no
matter what and things that should be done [but might not, matter is
still open to debate here].)

 1. Viral Software
    a. Viral scanning/cleaning software will not be used unless the
       accompanying documentation has been read by the support person
       doing the scan/cleanup.
    b. Viral scanning/cleaning software should be kept reasonably up to
date.
[As stated,  we've had fairly low virus activity,  so being up to date with
the latest is not real important - yet.]
    c. More than software product should be used for cross checking
purposes.
    d. After removal of a virus,  the machine/disk should be re-scanned to
       verify removal.

 2. Maintenance
[We maintenance machines owned by the University as well as those in the
student labs.]
    a. All incoming machines should be checked for infection.
    b. All returning spares will be checked for infection.
[We supply spares when possible so that the user is able to continue
working.]
    c. All diagnostic disks will have write protect tabs.
    d. If software is being restored to someone's machine (like a backup,
       format,  and then a restore) the disks should be checked for
infection.

 3. Installs
[We install software - like PC SAS - on users' machines.
    a. When possible,  install disks will have write protect tabs.
    b. When write protect tabs can not be used,  the install disks will be
       checked for infection upon return.
[Some software,  like dBase 4 we found,  writes to the install floppy during
installation.]
    c. User's machine should be checked for infection.
[This would take care of b .]

 4. Rentals,  Loaners
[We provide rentals and loaners upon occaision.]
    All rentals and loaned machines/software (for example, Lap Link) will be
    checked for infection upon return.

 5. Public access IT machines (Labs, OWA) with hard disks
    Machines such as these should be checked periodically for infection.
    Ideally,  some resident software (preferably a TSR) should be in place
    to help detect and prevent infection.  The question of requiring users
    to check their disks before insertion should be left open for the time
    being.

 6. User Support
    a. User Support staff should periodically check their machines for
       infection.
    b. Users bringing in disks for aid should have said disks checked;
 barring
       that the machine used to help them should be checked when done.
[People often bring in disks that are hammered or the software is not
working
right for some reason (bad Word Perfect printer files,  for example.)]

Subject: SimWare 3.1 (Mac)

I just ran SAM on my Mac, because someone was using it over the
weekend, and I don't know what they did.  I was told that my desktop
was infected with WDEF.  This bothered me, so I contacted the person
who had been using it.

They said that they had only used my hard drive to type a memo in MS
WORD and print it, and they had then deleted the file.

So I started checking all the disks that I have received from
"unknown" sources this month (a SAM scan on Jan 5 had been clean).

I of course suspected disks first where someone had said "Hey, here's
some cool game/sound/graphic".  All of them were clean.  I then began
to check "legitimate" software.  White Knight's new ScreenShare, and
MacKeymeleon II, both of which I received un-solicited, were clean,

BUT . . . SIMWARE's "SimMac 3.1 Application Disk" (Master Program),
which I received on or about Jan 11 was infected!  SAM reports that it
was last altered on 12/21/90 at 12:55 PM.  This INFURIATES me, as I
had up until today always trusted the programs that come straight from
the manufacturer sealed in the "Read Carefully BEFORE Opening" license
envelope!

Just thought someone out there might want to know.

Subject: Re: Review of SCAN (PC)

Pardon my input into something I know very little about, but I
have a question/comment:
I have observed that, according to a lot of the posts in this
newsgroup, many of these viri infect the boot sector of a disk.

To help combat this, what would be the possibility of 'delibrately'
infecting ones boot-sector with a piece of code that would display
some kind of 'ok' message if it hadn't been tampered with?

For example, as the computer goes to boot, it loads the boot sector
and prints something like 'All is ok as of ...<maybe insert a date
here.> as instructed by the program that lies there (the one I *put*
there.)  Ok.  Now, if the user doesn't see that message when he boots,
he can suspect that all is not ok.  Maybe this piece of code would run
some kind of check on itself to be sure it hadn't been relocated or
something...

This is just a brief flash of insight I had, I'm *not* a programmer
or anything.  Would this be a helpful tool in the war against viruses?

I would like to add that even within the very short amount of time I have
spent reading this newsgroup I have been impressed with the amount
that you guys seem to know about these animals.  It makes me feel
good that there are a number of obviously very capable dudes/dude-etts
working on the side of those who need protection from these creatures.

Hi there!

A friend of mine is responsible for a network of RM Nimbus machines.
So far they have not had any problems with viruses (at least, not that
they know about!) These machines behave largely as PCs (so I'm told)
but for some applications need to use an IBM-emulator.  So, a couple
of questions:

  1)  Are Nimbus machines susceptible to 'normal' PC viruses?
  2)  Are there any viruses specific to Nimbuses?

If anyone has any experience of viruses and Nimbuses (or should that
be virii and Nimbii :-) ), I would be most interested to hear from
you.

Thanks,

Aidan

the bug was introduced, you may have to go back several operating
system revisions to get back to "normal".

And, hey, I'm not even going to start talking about packet scanners on
a network that has NFS traffic.  At some point, the distinction
between virus, worm and trojan horse break down.  Has anybody seen a

Ever wonder why?

I saw a Unix virus long before I ever saw a PC virus.

All versions of Word Perfect (at least since 4.2) have had a self
testing module on them.  Neither F-XLOCK nor SCAN /AV nor any other
slef checker that adds code to the program can be used on it, since
the added code invalidates the internal self test.

This problem is a side-effect of the correction of another problem.
Here is what happened:

The "length" of EXE files can be defined in two ways - the actual (physical)
length of the file, and the length according to the header.  Case in point:

Turbo C++ is an 800K file, but according to the header it is only 165K long.
When it is executed, only 165K are loaded into memory, but the program may
later load parts of itself as necessary.

Using F-XLOCK (to add automatic detection of infection of unknown viruses)
involves adding a small module to the end of the file.  If Turbo C++ was
F-XLOCKed in this way, it would not run, as the resulting length of the file
was 800K (according to the header), and the file just could not be loaded
into memory.

For this reason, I decided to prevent F-XLOCK from adding the module to EXE
files, if the actual length was different from the length, according to
the header.

But, in many cases the difference between the two "lengths" is small, and
adding the module has no undesirable effect - I plan to change F-XLOCK a
bit in the next version, and will try to improve this.

Subject: Possible bug in FPROT 1.14? (PC)

I recently obtained a copy of F-PROT 1.14.  As timing would have it,
we also had a staff member from another department come in with a
virus on his disk.  By checking the file with Norton Utilities and the
VIRUSSUM.DOC file, I knew that it was the Sunday virus.  So I ran
F-FCHK against that disk, and sure enough it found the Sunday virus.
I answered YES when it asked if I wanted to disinfect the file, but it
said that it could not disinfect the virus because it looked like a
new strain.

Not liking that answer, I ran McAfee's CLEAN 72 just to see if it
would work.  Indeed it did work and the virus was removed.

Has anyone else discovered any problems like this one?

Thank you!
