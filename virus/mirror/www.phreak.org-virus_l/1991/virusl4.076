VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: Found Tester Virus [TV] still... (PC)

Thanks for the many helpful messages. I downloaded the new McAfee programs
from 130.160.20.80  in /pub/ibm-antivirus:
VSHIELD 3.6V77, VSHEILD1 VSCRC 0.2, NETSCAN V77, SCAN 7.2V77, CLEAN 7.2V77
To my knowledge, these are the latest versions on these programs. The only
program that finds the alledged virus is still NETSCAN. SCAN and CLEAN both
tell me there is no virus. My only reason for running NETSCAN is because it
wont goof up on my server's protected files. Does this mean it doesn't scan
those files for viruses or does it by-pass the file security?

As for 'LOG.COM', its from PC-Magazine and its been sitting on my hard disk
and on the server in the utils directory for years and I haven't run mine
in a long time and I doubt LOG.COM on the server was infected with the Read
Only Sharable flag. No other file has been flagged as having the virus.
Oddly, CLEAN V76 cleaned the virus by erasing the file and CLEAN V77 finds
no virus. (Note: I kept a copy of LOG.COM on a floppy..)

Enough of beating on this, I'd like to UUENCODE the file and send it direct
thru E-MAIL to McAfee.  What Bitnet address do I send it to?

This problem is not necessarilt indicative of a virus, but an
otherwise corrupted Directory (or possibly Desktop).  You could try
rebuilding your Desktop, but probably should defrag/optimize the
drive.  This would rebuild your directory.  For this I reccomend Disk
Express II, it has always worked wonders for me.

      This is not a generic case. I mostly use Phil Katz' excellent
      PKZIP (plug) and while it can create self-extracting files using
      an included utility, there is nothing that requires you to use
      the self-extracting feature. The file can still be viewed and
      selectively extracted using PKUNZIP just like a regular .ZIP
      file. The only difference is that you must completely specify the
      file as PKZIP defaults to the .ZIP extension.

      (e.g. PKUNZIP [-v|-n|etc] SELFEXTR.EXE)

      The biggest difference is that the .EXE is about 10k longer than
      the bare .ZIP but is handy when the DE doesn't have PKUNZIP.

Subject: Disk Killer Virus (PC)

We have had one of our hard disks encrypted with the Disk Killer
virus.  Supposedly there is a decryption package known as RestOgre and
a detection package known as AntiOgre. Would anyone have any
information about this virus, and known where I can find these
programs? Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks,
John

I reassembled LOG.COM from the original source (I use a modified
version of it) on a known clean machine and ran both SCAN (v76C) and
NETSCAN (v76) on it.  My results were comparable with Brian's.
Apparently, SCAN and NETSCAN are using two different search strings
for the Tester Virus.  Also apparently, a portion of the code in
LOG.COM coincidentally matches the string NETSCAN uses to identify the
Tester Virus.  I guess it was only a matter of time before this type
of thing occurred (or has it occurred before???).  Aryeh Goretsky may
wish to verify these findings (many apologies if I spelled your name
wrong).

BTW, NETSCAN also found the Tester Virus in my modified version of
LOG.COM, and the v77 versions of SCAN and NETSCAN give the same
results as the v76 versions.  I don't have the Tester Virus search
strings to try Norton Antivirus on those files.

Subject: Viruses in the USSR (PC)

By the information of the moscow AV researcher and developer of the
AIDSTST (one of the soviet analogs of SCAN) Dmitry N.Lozinsky there
are approx.  130 viruses in the USSR, including rare, very rare and
exotic.  Again, only 20-30 of them are really active.

Newly published book of Kiev AV researcher Nikolai N.Bezrukov contains
references to approx. 10-15 soviet viruses (Voronezh group, Hymn
group), though Lozinsky state that there are much more ones now and
the wave of the soviet viruses is coming after the wave of the
Bulgarian ones.  I could not confirm or deny these data - I've seen
only three ones, and it seems to be so that there are no more in
Leningrad this time.

Obviously I have a comment! :-)

Please let me know more about this varient on 4096 and I'll fix it up
in the next release of FLU_SHOT+ (Current release, by the way, is
version 1.82, released 4/7/91...next release is due out shortly).

The Brunnstein Computer virus Catalog would be the best place to start.
The INDEX.291 (available on cert) would give you at least the names of
viri for most micro systems, and the catalogues themselves (less widely
available) have the descriptions.

billj@uop.uop.edu (Snugglupagus) (vol 4 issue 74): we have noticed a
similar effect but only on the 800 kb floppies.  It seems that the
disc is fragmented and the missing space is recovered by drag copying
the old floppy to a newly initialised floppy.

I don't know if the hard disc software is more intelligent - I'd hope
so!  But you might try connecting up a spare hard disc, initialising
it, and drag copying the old one onto it, to see if your space
reappears.  Effectively you are compacting your disc by this method.

                                                 Monday, May 6, 1991

Open letter to:
Editor, The Sun
Vancouver, BC
V6H 3G2

Dear Sir:

It is with considerable dismay that I read your reprint of the
Canadian Press article on computer viral programs ("A Plague on the
Government", High Tech, Wednesday, May 1st, 1991.)  Although it is
somewhat encouraging to see that the growing problem is receiving some
coverage, I find it disheartening that the media is still mixing up
information from various data security problems and failing to
accurately inform the public.

The first problem is that of suggesting the problem is limited to the
government.  While government computers are being hit (and my own
experience in government offices indicates that the figures published
are at least an order fo magnitude too low), private companies and
individuals are suffering as well.  Certus International, a company
specialising in antiviral and disk recovery programs, recently
published a study in which 26% of responding corporations admitted to
having been hit with a computer viral "infection" in January of 1991
alone.  The study also indicates that the problem is growing at a rate
of 160% per quarter.  This suggests that by the end of this year,
almost all large companies can expect to be hit with at least one
infection every month.

The second problem is the sandwiching of paragraphs describing
attempts by outsiders to access government mainframe computers between
descriptions of the actions of microcomputer viral attacks.  The
structure of the article implies a relation between the "crackers" who
are trying to break into computers through "public access" ports and
links through "wide area networks" and the action of computer viral
programs, most of which are only intended to spread as widely as
possible through the microcomputer community.  While the former are of
concern only to large corporations, government and military, the
latter can affect anyone who uses a microcomputer.

The third problem is the poor description of the viral programs
themselves.  What is the meaning of the statement that the "Eddie"
("Dark Avenger" is somewhat of a misnomer, being the name of the
author, who has written a number of other viral programs) virus
"attacks a system's main storage area"?  It is true that the virus
will, on occasion, overwrite random sectors on the hard disk of an
infected microcomputer, and possibly corrupt files.  Or the statement
about the "so-called Stoned virus which destroys data."  Why
"so-called"?  The Stoned virus, which is currently far and away the
most common virus in North America, causes the least debate about its
name, and any destruction of data it causes is unintentional and
strictly limited to individual and special types of disks.

Comuter viral programs are certainly not the end of computers, as some
have reported, but they definitely do exist.  Viral programs present
some risk to microcomputer users of all backgrounds, particularly when
so few among the general population are well enough informed to take
appropriate precautions.  The problem of "viral illiteracy" is a
matter of computer "public health".  In the same way that healthy
people are at greater risk when the general population is full of
diseased "carriers", the average or even well-informed computer user
stands a greater chance of being infected if most computer users
around the individual may be infected and not know it.

Unfortunately, even the computer trade media is poorly informed on
this issue.  Lat year Computing Canada reported a story about a
sophisticated extortion attempt that made use of a "trojan horse"
program which pretended to be an AIDS information program while
actually setting your system up to be "encrypted" in such a way that
you would have to call upon the author's services.  While there was
never any indication that the program would reporduce itself in any
way, it was reported as a virus, thus supporting the general myth that
any type of computer problem is a virus.

Because correct information is so rare, myths about viral programs
abound.  One is that viral programs only come from "pirate" software,
another that those who use only "commercial" software are safe.
(Unfortunately, we have all to many examples of retailers, and even
commercial software authors, distributing infected software.)
Electronic bulletin board systems are often seen as a source
(unlikely) and, astonishingly, many believe that the use of a modem
itself is a means of infection (technically impossible.)

I wish to commend you on extending coverage of this important topic,
but fervently hope that in future the information provided is more
accurate.
