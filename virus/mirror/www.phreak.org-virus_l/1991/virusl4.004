Subject: Need help with (c) Brain

Hello All...

I seem to have been infected by the (c) Brain virus recently, and I
have some questions...

I do not quite understand how this boot sector virus was able to
contaminate my disks without actually booting from them.  Does DOS
routinely load in and execute some portion of a floppy if referenced??
Or is there a program that is typically the carrier?  From what I have
read, (c) Brain resides in memory and infects floppies - but how is
the virus initially loaded in?

Does anybody know what the typical virus scanner looks for in
reference to this virus?  I hope it doesn't just look for the label -
as none of my other disks seem to have it and I have never used anyone
else's disks...  I would like to know that for instance, McAfee's SCAN
will tell me a disk is infected regardless of the presence of the (c)
Brain label...

Now, I had the impresion that if (c) Brain was in memory that chkdsk
/a would return about 7K less total system memory than the computer
actually has.  When I tried it however, the total memory was ok, but
available memory was down by some 50K...  Did I miss something here?

Please respond via e-mail and I will post a summary at a later date.

Thank you in advance,

Tim Coldenhoff

Subject: Virus Prosecutions

	I read in a recent issue of VIRUS-L that the author of the
Scores virus is being prosecuted under a Texas statute.  I have a
question.  Have there been any previous prosecutions of the authors
of viruses, strictly defined?  The Morris Internet worm was similar
to a virus in terms of being a computer crime not enriching the
perpetator, but was a worm rather than a virus.  If there have been
any previous virus prosecutions (or civil actions), what was the
outcome?
	Thank you.

Subject: Latest version of McAfee's vcopy program? (PC)

I am looking for the latest version of McAfee's "vcopy" program. There had
been releases of "scan", "vshield", "clean" and "netscan" up to V72, but
the latest version of "vcopy" that I've got is V67. Is there any site that
I may get a later version?

Please reply via email since /usr/spool on our machine is running out of
space and the system administrator chose to dispose ALL news arrived.

Thanks in advance

Subject: Virus Vaccine (PC)

A friend of mine has an IBM-compatible computer and wants to dial into
the VM system here, but he needs a program that will prevent viruses
from infecting his system at home.  He would like a program such as
Virex.  He called Virex's 1-800 number, but it was disconnected.

If you know of any program, please contact me.

If you haven't found it already it is available from nic.funet.fi
(128.214.6.100). It is in pub/mac/doc dir.

Subject: CMOS devuce settings

I had what I thought was a viral infection on my PC Clone system
although VIRASCAN did not detect any problems. What I was seeing was
recently updated files had problems. Finally the system started
reporting BAD SECTORs in these files. This was only on my 3.5" 1.4 MB
floppy disk.

What had happened is... My system had been hit with a power surge that
wiped out the CMOS table entries. When I reconfigured the system, I
set up drive B: as a 5.25" 1.2 MB system instead of a 3.5" 1.4 MB
system. This allowed me to be able to read the contents of the disk!
However, anytime I wrote to the disk it screwed it up. Even using
NORTON utilities worked half way. Norton's disk check would report bad
blocks and mark them as such....

I am/was surprised that things actually worked as well as they did, as
I would have expected the improperly configured disk not to work at
all.

Subject: "Stoned" Virus (PC)

I have had a problem with the "Stoned" virus on my 8088 based XT.
After the virus appeared on Christmas Day, I reformatted (high level)
the hard drive and reconfigured the partition table using FDISK.
Although the message appeared on Christmas Day, the only problem that
my PC seemed to develop was the inability to load RAMDRIVE.SYS at
bootup.  Reconfiguring the partition table and reformatting the hard
drive do not seem to have helped RAMDRIVE.SYS to load.

I'm not even sure if the problems are related.

When I bootup, the error message appears:

	RAMDRIVE.SYS:Insufficient memory

Remember that the RAMDRIVE.SYS load worked prior to the appearance of the
"Stoned" virus.  I didn't change any parameters prior to that time.

I use MS-DOS 3.31.  Reloading a fresh copy of RAMDRIVE.SYS from the
original system disks does not have seemed to help either.

Any suggestions would be welcome.

I would appreciate either email replies or postings if the information
is of more general interest.
