I believe this is a garbled and partial quote from Ron Kovick who
claimed to speak for All Vietnam Vets.  I won't bore the net with my
opinion of this individual, Suffice it to say I don't agree with his
attitude.

I doubt Mr Kovick would use a virus to spread his drek, but I'm sure
the freaks and fops that follow people like this think they are "nobel
warriors" "striking a blow."

Yes, I have heard of this group and I did actually deal with them in
the past.  They seem to be very well organized and capable.  I believe
that for a small fee, last time I checked ($45) one could purchase a
full clean up utility and get their monthly report on any new viruses
and whats out there.  They also have I think if memory serves me right
on line help via the phone and the modem as you mentioned above.  If
you need anything more specific then send me E-mail and I'll try to
dig up my old information about them.  I remember I had to do a report
on viruses for one of my CS classes and they came in very handy.

This is not uncommon with Stoned.  I have seen exactly the same string
Raul mentions.  Stoned sometimes doesn't seem to replicate this last
part of itself correctly - I have seen several other variations on the
last part of the "Legalise" message getting munged.  As was mentioned
a week or two ago, on HD systems this can be due to the HD controller
writing up to 17 bytes to the MBR, immediately before the partition
table's reserved area, thus partially overwriting the "Legalise"
message on Stoned HD's.

This has no real significance for the virus as it never attempts to do
anything with this "message" except replicate it.

Subject: New variant of Dark Avenger (PC)

     We've received a new variant of the Dark Avenger or "Eddie" virus
that is not picked up by the current version of SCAN.  It has been
modified slightly to avoid detection, and all the text strings that
appear in the original Dark Avenger have been changed:

"Eat us !"
"<- Thanks to the Dark Avenger ->"
"(C) 1991 RABID International Development Corp! Scan String Killer Test"

(Quotes do not appear in the virus and are inserted for clarification)

     The virus itself is a trivial variation, and will be incorporated
into the next release of SCAN and CLEAN.  The virus can be detected
with the following scan string:

     #Dark Avenger Virus Variant
     "43 75 EF 74 19 2E A1 51" Rabid Avenger [DAV]

The virus can be removed by CLEAN, using the /EXT external virus data
file option as long as the [DAV] identification code is left intact to
tell it to remove it as the Dark Avenger virus.  For example:

      CLEAN C: /A /EXT davv.txt [DAV]

NOTE:  We have had several reports that this virus is circulating in the
       Toronto, Ontario (CANADA) area in a file named SHOWGIF or SHWGIF
       which is a hacked copy of an older version of CSHOW

It jumped around, infected and reinfected files; and it beeped at you
as if it was saying , "Here's Johnny!"

Another system I cleaned up had the Jerusalem-B virus; about 75 exe,
com and ovl were infected on the network. They had to be deleted
(cleaned and written over with a binary pattern); and then
reinstalled. The Platinum package this banking system was running had
a large number of files that had to be removed, and then platinum had
to be reinstalled; files replaced and one module replaced. All floppy
disks were inspected, and the virus was found on the 2 suspected
disks.

One more incident of an "Unknown virus" -- a trojan horse that
activated on 4/1; it played music and that was appropriate when
symphony was executed.  It sounded benign -- but in the procedures to
trap and erradicate it, it went into the panic mode and wiped out
total access to the hard drive.  Fortunately, the company had pulled
this machine off line as soon as it was acting abnormally.

When de-virusing a network, all workstations have to be devirused as
well as all floppy disks -- something brought it in...  This is a good
recommendationffor diskless workstations that keep anyone from taking
your valuable data off site,to the malicious or unintentional
introduction of a virus on the network.

There are viruses that infect data files as well as the executables
and overlays. I have a favorite virus fighter than remains resident in
the workstations attached to the server (or they are not allowed to
attach); and the net is secure.

Please be aware that the above viruses paid no heed to NetWare's SRO;
they might have been secure had they been flagged EXE ONLY -- but I'm
not willing to test this on a production unit.

Subject: PC Emulator on an ST (PC)

In reply to Andrew Mclean's query about the Atari ST.  First, when
running PC-DITTO, PC-DITTO II, or other PC emulator, the Atari ST is a
PC CLONE. However, a PC VIRUS cannot place itself onto a
write-protected diskette. The Atari file system is identical to the PC
file system, and a PC virus could install itself onto an ST or PC
partition on the hard disk. Since the Atari's OS (GEM and GEMDOS) is
in ROM, viruses are not as prevatent on the ST.

I'm experiencing a very slow PC for normal operations, and am thinking
it might be infected.  McAfee's Scan 7.1 reports no viruses, but ver
7.1 is a bit old.

Does another virus checker program exist that searches for more
viruses?  Is it FTPable?

Thanks.

Subject: Mainframe (VM) viruses

In reply to the comments concerning mainframe viruses, in particular,
viruses infecting IBM VM systems:

It would be very difficult for a virus to infect any shared system
progam because of the write protection enforced on shared disks.  This
protection is maintained at the "hypervisor" level and cannot be
circumvented by any "ordinary" user.  Of course a system type could
open the problem up by virtue of having write access to the common
disks.

With the advent of the new shared file system on VM this protection is
more vulnerable but with proper system controls should be manageable.

Of course user programs could easily become infected by virtue of the
user having write access to his own disks.

Viruses for mainframe (again I'm referring to VM/CMS) software are
very easy to do.  We even employ a program which is a form of virus
for our program accounting system.  We knowingly infect the
accountable programs with this "virus" which then reports (silently)
to a central server, the begin and end of execution of each program.
This accounting virus even loads and executes other programs without
the user having any knowledge of its doing so.

We attach this "virus" to other vendor's software completely without
any provision being made for its attachment.  It simply does what many
other PC-style viruses does and inserts itself as the entry point of
the program.

The reason that I think this hasn't caught on as a malicious virus is
because of the above restriction on common programs.  Most users don't
write their own programs and therefore don't provide a fertile
environment for the spread of that sort of virus.  And I sure hope it
stays that way.

General Description:

The best functioning parts of the package appear to be the scanning, and
"resident scanning" operations.  Not highly recommended; most suitable
for novice users with operations primarily limited to a single hard disk
and strictly limited disk swapping.

           Comparison of features and specifications



User Friendliness

Installation

Note that there is no indication on the packaging as to version number.
The first version tested had files dated November 2, 1990 and was stated
to be version 2.95 in the README.DOC file on disk.  The second package
received (from a different source) was identical except for two added
stickers identifying the item as "Made in Taiwan R O C", but had file
dates of November 8, 1990 to January 23, 1991 and was stated to be
version 2.95L in the README.DOC file.  Further reading of the README.DOC
indicates that this version is now "LAN aware", more viral programs are
recognized, scanning is faster and that minor cosmetic changes are made
to the display.  (Previous problems with documentation have also been
rectified, and the package now contains both disk sizes.)

The disk is shipped write protected, although only by a write protect
tab.  (The disk is not a "notchless" read-only disk.)  The installation
procedure is written with a "pre-infected" system in mind, and, if
followed carefully, should provide against infection by any virus known
to the program.  (The procedure to be followed in case of partition
table infection, although quite clear in its explanation of the problem,
is deficient in not recommending making a backup before beginning the
procedure.)

PC-cillin can install from, or to, any drive, but will not install to
the drive from which the installation files are being run.  Installation
is simple and reasonably quick.  Modification to AUTOEXEC.BAT or
CONFIG.SYS is simple, but non-destructive and maintains a backup file.

When "verifying for known viruses" during installation, PC-cillin states
that it is checking high memory.  This is an intriguing report, as the
machine used for testing has only the standard 640K and a CGA card.
Based on relative times, the program appeared to be checking
aproximately 2 megabyte of memory that did not exist.

Upon installation to a boot virus infected system, PC-cillin identified
the virus, but allowed the installation to proceed.  Upon "rebooting",
PC-cillin alerted for the presence of a boot sector virus.
Interestingly, once the disk was disinfected, PC-cillin allowed the disk
to boot normally.  Without having access to the encoding system used, it
is difficult to say what check is used to detect a change in the boot
sector.  A deliberate change made in the boot sector text had no effect.

The package makes provision for software updates of the "signature"
programs without the need for reinstallation of the entire system.

Ease of use

A single program, PCC.EXE, gives access to all functions, installation,
scanning (called "Quarantine" by PC-cillin) and the production of a
"rescue diskette".  Installation and scanning are clear and self-
explanatory in operation.  The making of a rescue diskette is less so,
involving unnecessary disk swapping.

When scanning, PC-cillin does not disinfect infected files, but does
offer to delete them.  The decision is left to the user.  Boot sector
viri on floppies are not disinfected, even if they are the "boot floppy"
that PC-cillin was installed on.  Repair information is apparently only
stored for the hard disk PC-cillin is installed on.

Because of its "background" operation, PC-cillin presents an "inverse
face" (PC graphics character 02H) in the upper right hand corner of the
screen when in operation.  The documentation states that this display
can be toggled off or on with <Alt><Ctrl><Tab>, and that the operation
of PC-cillin in background can be toggled on and off with
<Alt><Ctrl><Backspace>.  The message displayed by the PCCILLIN program
at invocation now indicates the same key sequence, but the toggle still
does not work.

Help systems

None provided.

Compatibility

The scanning function of PC-cillin is now stated to recognize 176
different viri, and it does recognize the most common viri that make up
the bulk of current infections.  The "vaccine" functions of the product
are either very intelligent or very doubtful: the program will allow
programs to modify themselves, other programs and disk boot sectors, as
well as deleting program files.  (Disk writing by certain programs
appears to be restricted, but in testing no alarms were generated by
multiple attempts to write to program files through the use of different
programs and editors.)  Protection of boot sectors appears limited to
the "installed" hard disk: the program will not recover an infected boot
sector floppy.

Company Stability

Unknown.

Company Support

When the company first shipped the product for review, an incorrect
Customs declaration for shipping to Canada delayed shipping of the
review copy.

The program makes provision for software updates of the "signature"
programs, but does not indicate any definite way to keep customers
informed.  Although my copies are registered, I have received no notice
of the change in versions.

Documentation

The documentation is clear and well laid out, and contains an excellent
discussion of general viral operations.  The progression through the
book is logical, and novice users should be able to follow it clearly.
Advanced users will still find items of interest in the section on
general viral concepts.  The "stiff" binding and grammatical errors in
the README.DOC file have been corrected.


Hardware Requirements

At least one parallel (printer) port is required.  The "Immunizer Box"
attachment is said to be transparent to user data.

Performance

The product is "aware" of the currently most common viri.
Identification in various areas relies on known viral activity: although
memory is checked, it does not appear to "find" memory resident viri
which can also be found on disk.  Vaccine or recovery activities are
restricted at best.

Local Support

None provided

Support Requirements

The program is easy enough for a novice to use and install without
assistance.  If a virus is found, it is recommended that experienced
personnel deal with it.

                          General Notes

A great deal of thought and planning has gone into the concept and
packaging of this product.  Provision for the use of floppy diskettes,
and a general strengthening of the "vaccine" and change detection
portions of the program would benefit it immensely.
