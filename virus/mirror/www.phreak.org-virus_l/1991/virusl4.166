Certainly, just because a virus-scanner does not go off does not mean
that you should feel complete confidence.  It is true that LZEXE'd
files often do not decompress back to their original parents.  It is
also true that UNLZEXE often botches things up such that the UNLZEXE'd
file will not load and run even though the LZEXE'd file will.  Most of
this has to do with .EXE relocation information in the header (LZEXE
is good at munging a lot of this), and should not affect searching for
string signatures.  PKLITE is better in that unless you choose the
option which purposes strips the executable of extra data (such as
debugging information inserted by CodeView), it is capable of
decompressing files which it compresses back to the original, byte for
byte.  Testing this on many .EXE and .COM files seems to even
corroborate PKWare's claim.

If you PKLITE an arbitrary executable, *ANYONE* can decompress it with
their copy of PKLITE.  Developers who wish to make it less easy for
anyone who may wish to be able to examine their code may register for
a customized copy of PKLITE whose output cannot be decompressed by
end-user PKLITE.  This is bad in that even the largest commercial
developers have been known to be inadvertently infected and distribute
infected applications, and if they choose to get the special PKLITE,
we can no longer check the original code ourselves.  However, it isn't
easy for malicious virus-writers to insert their virii into such files
at the source -- so I don't think this is much of a concern.

Since folks are flaming sites that keep virus knowledge secret, I
thought it might be useful to mention a slightly more enlightened
approach...

At our College, we install the disinfectant init in EVERY system disk
given out to users.  Whenever an infection is detected, we place a Mac
next to the main door to the public user room and instruct the student
assts.  to check every disk that comes in.  If it's clean, they
install the latest edition of Disinfectant.  Simultaneously, we send
out e-mail notices to all of the academic departments whenever a new
outbreak is detected.

Over the past few years, there have been outbreaks of several Mac
viruses (NVIR, SCORES, WDEF, ...) but we've usually managed to beat
them back within a couple of weeks.  Virus infections are most common
after vacations or toward the end of the school year when most folks
are hurrying to complete projects and get careless about their disks.

Note that this sort of virus isn't found in programs, but in the
"hidden" first sector of disks, and it hasn't become "active" in your
computer (at the moment) but must have been in some other computer
your diskettes were used in.

If you can remember what computers they were used on (even to simply
transfer data files), you should warn their owners to check for
viruses (but, of course, it is hard to remember everywhere old
diskettes have been, hence the success of boot sector viruses like
stoned).

What does this mean? Well, when most computers start up, they look at
the first sector of the first track on the disk(s), and load whatever
program is there; this should be a bootstrap program, to load the full
operating system. If the operating system isn't there it should tell
you to try another disk. Just to compicate things, modern MSDOS
systems have another level inserted - the "MBR" or partition table
contains a table of information about partitions on teh disk, plus a
bit of code to load the bootstrap program (which pretty much carries
on as if it were the first sector to be executed). Boot sector viruses
act just like that - they inhabit the boot sector of a diskette (or
one of the boot sectors - if you call the MBR a boot sector - of hard
disks); they install the virus in RAM somewhere, and then call the
original boot sector, which executes as if nothing was changed. A
diskette can get a boot sector virus even if you put it in an infected
PC to transfer data (or even do a directory listing!), but it won't
transfer the virus onto another computer unless you try to boot from
it (which includes leaving it in the drive accidentally when you
switch on or do a Ctrl-Alt-Del). Notice, you only need to *try* to
boot from it - if the diskette doesn't have an operating system (and
you get the "non-system disk" message) your computer can still be
infected.

Hope this helps,
Mark Aitchison.

The gremlins got me 8-).  Despite several re-readings, I missed an
obvious blunder, which probably rendered this paragraph

Subject: F-prot, Clean, Joshi and DOS 2.0. (PC)

Last week I was asked to disinfect a 5 1/4 in. - 360K bootable floppy
with Print Shop installed and infected with Joshi. I was told that the
user had tried to remove the virus but was unable to do so. I started
with Fridrik's F2 (Part of FPROT 2.00) as in the past I've had the
most sucess with F-prot in removing Joshi. The program identified the
infection and reported removal, yet a repeated scan again reported the
presence of the virus. The disk would not boot, though I don't know if
it would have booted before I ran F2 on it as I didn't try to. Passing
on to McAfee's SCAN and CLEAN I had the same experience, the CLEAN
programm reporting removal, and a subsequent scan reporting continued
presence. Examining the boot sector I noticed that it was formated
with DOS 2.0, and the system files were DOS 2.0 also. Luckily enough I
had a copy of DOS 2.11 stashed away and a simple SYS command (well,
not *so* simple, I had to manually free the necessary space - later
DOS version could not have fitted on the disk along with all the other
files) seems to have resolved the problem and I was able to return a
functioning floppy to the owner (Print Shop uses a rather silly copy
protection scheme so I couldn't just copy all the files to a clean
disk; one more reason to say no to copy protection.). What intrigues
me though is the thought that the problem could have been due to the
old DOS version.  Could F2 and CLEAN have some problem with DOS 2.0?.
As there are probably still a lot of bootable floppies with old DOS
versions in action, such a situation would be at best an
inconvenience.

Subject: Possible virus on Cypress Semiconductor 5.25 inch disks (PC)

We have received notification of a possible virus on Cypress
Semiconductor 5.25" floppy disks identified as MAXPROG version 2.72C
dated May 1991.

It is said that these disks contain the STONED virus in the boot
sector.  3.5" disks and programs downloaded from the Cypress BBS are
said to be clean.

Since this is specialized software used in the programming of memory,
it is doubtful that many copies have been sent out. Cypress is
reported to be in the process of contacting known recipients of the
disk.

Of course, remember his program gave plenty of warnings that this was
only experimental, and it isn't called in by default when scanning for
viruses, so there should be little worry on the part of uneducated
users.

Hmm, this sort of thing is likely to happen a lot now, as we seem to
be at the start of a new generation of virus scanners (at last!, some
would say). In some ways it parallels the days when very simple string
scanners were made, with libraries of virus strings not produced as
carefully as today. I feel the answer is not to avoid heuristic
scanners, but to improve their hit rate before being released by some
organisation establishing a huge library of good and infected files,
and providing a certification of anti-virus products for free, inthe
interests of everybody.  I must say that I ran this particular program
on what I think is a large number of files, and (apart from compressed
files, and ones obviously odd to me, at least) the number of false
alarms was small. But I doubt it could ever be zero.

Well using a regular CRC integrity check does help, but it is not a general
solution. A virus can easily fool the checksumming program by simply adding
a pattern which makes the checksum correct. This approach would therefore
only work if the checksumming algorithm is kept secret, but that is of course
not a good solution.

A better and general solution is to use cryptographic checksums. It is then
free to distribute the algorithm used since the secret relies upon a small
key which can be changed very often and individually for the users. A virus
can not add a pattern which makess the checksum correct since it not knows
which key that has been used. The only way would be to break the crypto, and
that is much more involved than just adding a pattern.

If you would like to get some info on a commercial packet for unix machines,
calculating cryptographic checksums, send me an email to "tommyp@isy.liu.se".

Running a checksumming program (cryptographic or not) on a unix host obviously
has the advantage of beeing immune against stealth viruses, since it is not
the same machine that does the checksumming that may be infected. A check-
summing program on the PC must be started after booting from a "clean" discette.

I suggest that you send an example of your program that triggers the
alarm to Frisk. This may help him to modify and improve his algorithm,
and also he will probably suggest you what modifications to make in
order to avoid the alarm.

Hi,

I just came accross the AZUSA virus the other day.  It appeared at
boot up along with a STONED related virus.  I was not able to clean it

Does anybody know what this virus does?  What programs will clean it?

It won't, if the virus modifies the DPB to indicate that there is only

To my knowledge, more than 30 % of the known viruses are Vienna,
Jerusalem, Cascade, or Amstrad strains. The question, however, is how
many strains have been created just to fool a particular scanner. Does
anybody have any information on this?
