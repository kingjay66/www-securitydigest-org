     I think all the hype over System 7 has caused a lot of people to
have incorrect ideas about what System 7 is like.  It does not
magically change all the rules of Mac programming; in fact, based on
my experience, it's more compatible with older software than System 6
was.  It does add new features, but in almost all cases it adds them
in a way that makes them very comparable to existing ones (just a
heckuva lot easier to use).
     FileShare, for instance, is almost exactly equivalent to
AppleShare, but without the dedicated server.  A program in a
FileShare folder (virus-infected or not) appears the same way as a
program in an AppleShare server folder, and viruses and
virus-detection utilities should react to it in roughly the same way.
Any virus detector worth its weight in RAM will check every resource
file that's opened, no matter where it comes from.  So FileShare
shouldn't create any new problems there (except for the problem of
uneducated users networking for the first time who don't realize the
potential for infection, and without any AppleShare administrator to
troubleshoot).
     There's no "protection" code in AppleEvents, as far as I know,
and the reason is simple; what good would it do?  Sure, a virus could
trigger spurious AppleEvents, but a virus under either System 6 or 7
can do things that are a heckuva lot worse; delete files, format
disks, crashing the system, etc.  Until code is added to make it
impossible for a virus to do these things (which brings up the age-old
problem: how to distinguish a virus from a legitimate request to
delete a file, etc.?), it seems silly to try to throw in code to keep
a virus from choosing Quit or whatever.
     Finally, virtual memory is exactly the same as physical memory,
only slower.  About the only VM-specific nasty a virus could pull off
would be to mess up or delete the virtual-memory storage file on the
hard disk; this would crash the system, but again, as crashing the
system is trivial under either System (the tricky thing to do is
*avoid* crashing it... :) ), no new security holes are added here.
     IMHO, System 7 will, if anything, make it a bit harder for
viruses and Trojan horses to propagate, if only by cleaning up the
System Folder a bit.  How many of us would even notice if somebody
slipped one more file into the morass of junk (whoops, vital System
extensions) that all of us keep in there?  By sorting things out into
at least a few subgroups, the new System will make it easier to keep
some sort of grasp of what's going on in there.

Disinfectant does not attempt to deal with application-specific
viruses which spread via application scripting languages. These are
very different kinds of viruses from the "normal" kinds of viruses
Disinfectant was designed to handle. Modifying Disinfectant to detect
and repair these kinds of viruses would be a major project, and I do
not have the time or energy to undertake such a new project right now.

This recent "Three Tunes" virus is not the first HyperCard virus -
there was a very similar HyperCard virus named "Dukakis" which
appeared several years ago. Disinfectant doesn't recognize that virus
either.

Symantec's SAM 3.0 does detect HyperCard viruses.

Subject: First sighting of Dark Avenger (PC)

This posting is just to let the virus trackers know.... We have had
our first reported sighting of Dark Avenger here at IUPUI (Indiana
University - Purdue University at Indianapolis)

It showed up on a LAN server in one of our open computer clusters. It
was eradicated but the software it damaged had to be reinstalled on
the server.

I have been, for some time, suggesting that our computer clusters have
a dedicated viurs checking DOS computer and a dedicated Mac.  And that
our users be requested to submit their disks for checking before they
enter the cluster to use the LAN.  Of course, that would not
absolutely insure a virus free LAN but it would help us help innocent
and uninformed users.  My suggestion is getting more attention now
that we were hit on the server.

Thanks again to all those people out there that made it possible for
us to catch and destroy this virus -- both documentation and virus
checking software were a big help to us.

I used to trust write-protect tabs until very recently. My main advice
is: DON'T!

Possibly, the reason why it sometimes fails, other than obvious loose
wires, is because of light bouncing around the diskette drive.
Remember, a tab over the notch should stop the light getting to the
photo-detector on the other side; if it can bounce of a silvery tab,
onto metalwork, and onto the detector, it is like having no tab on at
all. I haven't tested my theory, but I suspect black tabs are better,
and there should be little distance between the diskette and the
photo-transistor or whatever. Someone may be able to answer the
question as to whether the circuitry uses synchronised pulsed light,
or plain light (the latter would mean daylight from outside the
computer could nullify the protection system).

The biologists amongst us would be much happier if you reversed these
two names, since a virus is a much more dependent organism than is a
bacterium.  A virus uses the host biochemical mechanisms to replicate,
while a bacterium has its own.  So the dependent replicators should be
called virii and the independent ones bacteria, assuming we want to be
consistent with the analogy.

Copied it, eh?  Well, we'll let that pass for the moment ...

You will have noticed that VIRUCIDE is, in fact, a McAfee Associates
product, for all that it is marketted by Parsons Tech.  Therefore, the
signature strings used in VIRUCIDE will be very close to those used in
SCAN, and that is likely to cause the program to give some false
positives.  There is nothing ~wrong with either program, at least not
as indicated by waht you saw.

Why it said VIRUCIDE was compressed is a new one on me.

     Version 77 of these programs adds four new viruses: The Empire
virus is a floppy disk boot sector and hard disk partition table
infecting virus.  It is based on the Stoned virus and was first
reported in Alberta, Canada.  The Star Dot virus was received from
Europe.  The New Sunday virus is a variant of the Sunday virus.  The
Casino virus has also been added.  For a listing of complete listing
of viruses, refer to the VIRLIST.TXT file.
     Additionally, detection of three virus variants have been added:
The Collor variant of the Stoned virus, which contains the messages
"Collor, um tiro basta!" and "Call John McAFee?" was reported in Sao
Leopoldo, Brazil by Mr. Raul F. Weber.  Another variant of the Stoned,
containing a message about Saddam Hussein has been added.  The Rabid
variant of the Dark Avenger virus has also been added.
     The scanning routine for Version 77 has also been sped up.  It is
now 5% faster than Version 76.

CLEAN-UP
     Version 77 replaces Version 76 of CLEAN which had a bug in it
that prevented it from removing the viruses added in that release.
The viruses added in Version 76 were: the 555, 651, 3066, Air Cop,
Beeper, Black Monday, Den Zuk, Fellowship, Filler, Ghost (Boot Sector
Portion) Korea, Lazy, Lisbon, Mardi Brothers, Murphy, Print Screen-2,
RPKS, Striker, and Typo Boot viruses.

Subject: Re: HyperCard virus --should I wait to script? (Mac)

O.K., Paul, much to my chagrin, the script has the _potential_ of not
working since scriptors can simply change their code to get around it.
I am currently working on a separate script that searches for possible
viruses and trojans.  So, if anyone has the code to the new German HC
virus, would you please send it to me?

This new script is essentially designed to work in HC 1.2.x because it
appears from all the EMAIL that I'm getting that my script works
(through some fluke, mind you) in 2.0v2.  I am studying for finals
right now and have been unable to confirm that it will still work with
a virus implementing "Start using" in its script, or if I can simply
intercept the message even though it may be sent directly to HC.

The problem with my new script is that if there is a handler in the
inheritence path that the user has set up, I won't ever see the
necessary messages to do the job.  This new script will search a stack
when the stack opens.  Options still to be worked out.  Suggestions
welcome.  If anyone wants to run with this idea and beat me to the
punch, feel free, 'cause the main thing is to get to the point where
vandals get the picture that we can protect HC as well as VD,
Disinfectant, and Virex can protect the rest of the Mac.

[from Daily Telegraph (UK newspaper), Fri 28 April 1991]
<<BT's antidote to computer viruses, by Roland Gribben, Business Editor.>>

British Telecom [= BT] has set up an investigation to tackle an outbreak of
computer viruses. In one case, users found a  ball  bouncing  across  their
screens instead of data after part-time students unwittingly introduced the
"Italian  bouncing  ball"  virus  by  bringing  in  disks  from their local
college. Reports of viruses in the extensive computer networks operated  by
BT are averaging one a fortnight[,] and half of them have been confirmed as
infected  disks. The company [= BT] has set up a "help desk" as well as the
investigation team to try to control the problem. BT  has  50,000  personal
computers  and  admits  the  problem has become serious. So far the viruses
have not disrupted sensitive systems or the  telephone  billing  operation,
but  the company has tightened controls on the use of software in an effort
to limit damage. An 18-point guide has been issued to  staff  to  curb  the
spread  of  contaminated  disks.  Employees are told not to borrow or lkend
software or programs between their own and BT computers and limit  the  use
of software to reputable manufacturers". The special investigation team at-
tempts  to pinpoint the source of each virus and gather evidence in case of
legal action. Mr.Charles Brookson, operations manager of  BT's  electronics
systems  security  unit,  says: "The objectives are to sanitise and restore
the system as soon as possible, gather evidence to use  in  claims  against
third parties or as part of our own defence in litigation."

Results of years of research into the common cold have been threatened by a
computer virus, writes Michael Fleet. Computer screens at the  Common  Cold
Unit  at  the  University  of Wales, Cardiff, went blank this week when the
virus spread after being introduced innocently  by  a  student.  "We  first
noticed  it when we could not call up information on the latest literatrure
about  colds,"  said  Dr.Ronald  Eccles,  the  centre's  director.  Experts
identified  the  virus as one which was first discovered in Belgium in 1989
and used a "disinfectant program" to cure it.
