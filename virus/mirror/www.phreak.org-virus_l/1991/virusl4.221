Interesting little tidbit in the Nov. 11th PC Week in Spencer Katt's
column:

	Word Perfect, ..., was also hit by some network malevolance
	late last month. What started out as a bug in printer format

This certainly sounds goofy. Anyone have any idea what the Katt's

Subject: Re: DIR-2 found in USA (PC)

As a follow-up to Mike Martin's message, this may also be of interest:

1.  Dir-2 (a.k.a. FAT) is a fast moving virus.  In addition to the lab
    Mike reported, we had infections at two other labs at nearly 100%.
    All this happened in a matter of days from the time we suspect the
    first infection occurred.

2.  Though we will probably never learn how the virus arrived, it was
    transported from PC to PC via key disks required for a copy-
    protected computer-based instruction program.  Yet another good
    reason to avoid copy protection.

3.  McAfee's SCAN and VSHIELD version 84 correctly identify the virus.
    Unfortunately, due to a large staff relocation, we did not update
    immediately when the new release was issued.

4.  Microcom's VIRx version 1.8 and Fridrik Skulason's F-PROT version
    2.01 also correctly identify the virus.  I have not checked with
    Central Point or Symantec about updates.

5.  McAfee's CLEAN version 84 successfully removes the virus with no
    after effects.  I am not aware of any other programs that
    currently do the same, though a back-up and restore of the infect-
    ed disk may also be a means of recovery (read on).

6.  The virus cannot infect NetWare volumes, as there is no DOS FAT
    available for them to modify.  I don't know if this holds true for
    other networks, but would expect that they, too, would prohibit
    anything from attempting to modify the FAT on shared volumes.

7.  Once a program infected with DIR-2 is run, the virus immediately
    installs itself on the hard disk and modifies the hard disk's FAT.
    It is not necessary to run a program on the hard disk for the
    virus to be transferred.

8.  With the exception of some copy protection schemes failing (our
    first clue to the virus) and un-explained (though infrequent)
    system crashes, (especially in MS-Windows), the virus is invisible
    while active.

9.  If the system is booted from a clean DOS diskette, a DOS CHKDSK
    will report cross-linked files.  This is because the virus changes
    the FAT so that all entries for executables point to the virus,
    which then redirects to the actual file while after the virus
    itself executes.  CHKDSK will report no problems if the virus is
    active.

10. Attempts to copy executables when the virus is not active will
    only copy the virus itself.  If you later run the copied file,
    the virus will load into memory and you will return to the DOS
    prompt without the desired program every running.  Attempts to
    copy executables while the virus is active will yield both the
    executables and the virus.

11. Though not fully tested, it seems that using a DOS BACKUP of the
    infected disk will yield the original, uninfected executables.
    At least this is what I found, and it makes sense when you under-
    stand how the Dir-2 virus works.  This allows another method of
    recovery from the virus:  Back-up the entire system while the
    virus is active, reboot from a clean DOS disk, reformat the
    infected disk, and restore the backup.  This did work for me the
    3 times I tried it.

This is all I know about the virus at this time.  Once detected,
recovery is simple with McAfee's CLEAN v84.  If you elect to use the
backup/restore method of recovery, make certain to either low-level
format your disk or use a utility that will overwrite all data in all
clusters before the restore (e.g., Norton's WipeDisk or WipeInfo, or
PC Tools Compress with the "Clear Unused Clusters" option turned on),
and do another complete scan to make sure the virus hasn't somehow
been restored as well.

I would rather suggest that they should be called "Plovdiv 1.1" and
"Plovdiv 1.3", rather than "Bulgarian Damage".  "Damage" is already in
use - for a couple of Italian Diamond (V1024) derived viruses, and as
"Diamond" is of Bulgarian origin, it might be somewhat misleading.

Neither of which seems to work properly....

Which appears related to a sample named "Warrier" (not "Warrior").  I have
not been able to get "Warrier" to infect anything, but "Brainy works without
problems.

A quite interesting little virus, by the way - It may insert itself into
the middle of a .COM program, without changing the beginning of the file -
a trick which is only used by one other virus so far.

While the combination proposed by you is a good idea and will stop
most of the current viruses, it presents some difficulties to
implement and could create a false sense of security, since it does
not stop -all- viruses - not even all of the currently known ones,
lest those that could be written by using only the currenty known ways
of attack.

First about the difficulties. Currently no compression system or
readonly driver could be installed -beneath- DOS. However, you
probably mean that they should be installed as a device driver, that
is, -beneath- the DOS file managing level, but -above- the DOS sector
managing level. Even such a solution presents problems, since (as I
mentioned in a pervious posting), I currently don't know a way to
install both compression, disk locking and a separate INT 13h handling
program on the same volume.

As to the security problems, note that a virus does not have to
circumvent a protection in order to spread. The fact that most
Messy-DOS viruses do is because there is virtually no protection on
Messy-DOS and any tries to achive one are just doomed patches which
can be circumvented easily - which tempts the virus writers to do so.

Suppose that a virus does not try to circumvent the multi-layer
protection scheme that you proposed above. Say, it just writes to
files when the user does so, that is, when they are copied, compiled,
deleted or whatever. Since the user really intends to modify the file,
the protection scheme will either allow the operation without notice
(if it is intelligent enough to guess what the user wants), or will
ask for confirmation. Do you know a user (however experienced) who
will say "No" if the protection asks him whether he really wants to
write in the copy of the file which he is just creating? (In fact, do
you know a user who will continue to use a protection scheme which
asks such silly questions?) Agreed, if a virus adopts such an
infection scheme, its spread will be much slowlier. However, it'll
bypass the protection completely, which may pay off, causing it to
spread much wider than if it only tried to bypass standard monitoring
software. In general, implementation of disk/file protection (even if
it is implemented correctly, which is quite difficult under Messy-DOS)
has the effect of only slowing down the virus spread, not of stopping
it completely.

Next, consider a virus of the Dir II type (-not- the Dir II itself,
since it won't infect volumes driven by device drivers), which infects
the directory entries information. Since DOS often updates this
information (when you copy, delete, rename, etc. a file), the
modification of this information must be permitted, if you need
something more useful than a write-protected disk. And since the virus
does its I/O via calling the DOS device drivers directly, for any
monitoring/compressing/etc. software, the write requests will seem to
come from DOS itself...

> Now, my worry is with viruses that do, in fact, try to manipulate the
> disk behind a compression scheme. That's probably getting too far

Indeed. The result of the work of such viruses is usually that the
disk becomes highly corrupted... For instance, the random sector
destruction that the Dark Avenger viruses perform could easily make
a Stacked volume heavily crippled.

Currently none of the known viruses uses INT 26h for -spreading- (that
is, for writing its body in the infected objects). However, quite a
few of them use INT 26h for their payload, to cause damage.

It all depends on how his system determines what it does like... It
must either stop dead any disk writing (i.e., write-protecting the
hard disk), or try to make clever guesses whether the write is legal
or not. If it does the latter, it's relatively easy to design a virus
which will bypass it - its write requests will seem to come from DOS.

Even the FAT and the directory entries? This means that you cannot
rename or delete a file on the protected volume or even add a new file
to it while the protection is on. Therefore, it practically
write-protects the disk. But, if this is the main goal, it doesn't
need to remember all that stuff and use clever assumptions... Just
denying the write functions of INT 13h will be enough and will have
the same effect.

That is, nothing can be done with the protected disk except than
reading from it. Then why not just forbid writing without messing with
FATs and direntries?

All of this just to perform the same task, which could be achieved by
a switch on the write-enable wire of the hard disk cable... :-)

Oh, it does. If it protects the FAT and the dir entries, no virus can
create a new COM file for an existing EXE one. In fact, no one can
create a file (any file) at all...

If an infected file can be added to the disk and the system only
protects the system disk areas from tampering (although these two
things are pretty incompatible with each other), I don't see how it
will prevent the infected file from being executed. Whether the virus
in it will be able to infect other objects is another story.

I have already seen something similar (although better, simpler and
cheaper) realized - the ThunderByte card. It's pretty good, but does
not stop all possible viruses, of course.

Hmm none of the mailer programs for BBSes that I have used was able to
interpret the keyboard redefinition codes in the ANSI bombs. This is
not a danger. The danger is if somebody puts an ANSI bomb in an
archive's comment or in a README file, so that if you view it later
(in DOS mode, not using your communication software). Anyway, I always
disable the keyboard reprogramming feature of my ANSI driver, there is
no real need for it - at least for me.

 Disabling the write-protect detection mechanism in floppy drives
 is a trivial task. It is, however, a task that software cannot
 perform!  The OPERATOR did that.  A hammer, or other similarly-
 persuasive device, will also defeat hardware protection.
 There's no question about it...

 Yes, but failing to scan is not the reason why he got infected.
 Scanning is not foolproof either; the person could have scanned and
 still gotten infected. Or, if the scanner was not too well designed
 (as some are not), then the act of scanning itself might have spread
 the virus further to other parts of the system.

 In fact, of all the antiviral software methods, scanning is
 the least foolproof. Useful, though, as a stopgap measure.

 This is true in every case. Overconfidence makes bad security.
 The same effect could have been achieved by subverting the scanner,
 or whatever other defense system was in use.

 It says nothing about the desirability or undesirability of
 hardware protection.

Hi everyone.

I was wondering if anyone else has found a bug with Vshield v.84.  It
seems that when installed, a regular Ctrl-Alt-Del which usually causes
a warm reboot, doesn't work the same.  Instead, it does a cold boot,
causing my drives to spin atrociously, and a memory check at the
startup.  When I removed Vshield from my UMB's, everything worked
fine.

Anyone else had this happen?

It's interesting to hear that someone is (almost) satisfied with DD,

It's possible that the (1988) version of DD which I was using differs
from the version you use, but please answer the following question:
Are you able to put Cylinder 0 in the protected zone?  If the answer
is Yes, doesn't your version use a device driver (ADDPART.SYS) to
modify the MBR at boot time?  If the answer to the first question is
No, then how can DD protect the MBR against the Stoned and other MBR
infectors?

Subject: NIST Naming Proposal

The NIST virus naming proposal has been mentioned in passing a couple
of times recently; this message is intended to provide a brief overview
of that proposal.  This is an ongoing project, with documents in *draft*
status.  The project was inspired by the difficulties we have experienced
when attempting to cross-reference and verify virus information.

The goals of the proposal are: 1) to reduce the confusion caused by
multiple names for a single virus; and 2) to ensure "good" virus names.
We believe that "good" names are ones are that are easy to remember,
are not offensive, and describe the behaviour or contents of the virus.

The proposal consists of two parts: naming guidelines and naming
procedures.  To make a long story short, the naming guidelines
call for names of the form
	"FAMILY-STRAIN;Variant#"
where STRAIN and Variant# are optional.  Viruses which have minor
differences with existing viruses use the name of the existing virus
with a new variant number.  Viruses which are derived from existing
viruses, but have substantial modifications in technique or side
effects, would use the existing family name but would recieve a new
STRAIN.  Entirely new viruses are assigned a new FAMILY name.

The naming procedures assigns the laboratory which isolates and analyzes
the virus responsibilty for assigning the virus' name.  A central site
would maintain the central naming database, arbitrate disputes between
laboratories, and generally enforce the naming guidelines.

This proposal has been presented to members of both EICAR (at the Sept.
conference) and the AVPD.  We will be discussing this project again at the
AVPD conference later this month.  We are hopeful that the proposal will
be widely accepted, but a number of unanswered questions remain.

For those who are interested, we have posted the latest drafts for
anonymous ftp from csrc.ncsl.nist.gov (129.6.54.11).  The files are in
the directory /pub/viruslab.  The documents are available in both ascii
text and PostScript formats.  The ascii text versions are nameconv.txt and
nameproc.txt; the PostScript versions have the .ps extension.

VSHIELD will prevent you from performing a soft-boot (Ctrl Alt Del)
with an infected floppy in the A: drive, however, if you actually boot
up from an infected floppy, then VSHIELD (which I assume is on the
hard disk) is not run and a virus will have a chance of transferring
to the hard disk.  VSHIELD will, however, detect the virus the next
time it is run.

>Or should I use different program?

If you want to prevent your PC's from being booted from a floppy disk,
you may want to consider a new BIOS that will allow you to "lock out"
boots from the floppy drives, or a card that will do something similar.
