Those of you that have been complaining about the size of Patricia
Hoffman's virus catalog will be glad to hear that it now comes complete
with it's own hypertext display program called VSUM.EXE, about 36K.
Handsome, swift and easy to use.  Just pick or enter VSUM.EXE and follow
your nose.  Of course, it supports your mouse.  Very slick!!  I hope to
see more information packaged like this in the future.

It is still large, about 360K zipped and more than 700K when unzipped,
so it will take up a lot of room.  I do not know a solution to that
problem  (I will keep it zipped on my machine and unzip it only for use
on the road, while it is unzipped on our LAN, ready for use.)

Subject: What are the chances?

  I have wondered this for a while:  If a compressed file is scaned by
some virus scanner, what are the chances that the compressed data will
look like a virus?  Example:
  Say I have a program that I wrote on a "certified" clean system.
(Granted, no system is 100% certain to be clean, but lets say ours is!
;) ) Now, say I compress it with a compression program, and in the
course of running my virus-scanning program (Signature checking), it
sees the compressed code of my program looks just like it's signature
of the "XXY" virus...
         *** What are the chances?  Or is this possible? ***

  (...makes you say, "Hmmmm...")

Why is it so bloody hard to get a friggin' price out of you guys, eh?

Do you have a price list?  If so, publish it?

I am interested in getting the price for a single machine to use your
scan program.  Type of usage? I would use it for scanning disks to
look for viruses and to make sure that there are no conflicts between
our two programs.  Updates?  Well, since I believe it becomes the
responsibility of the registered user of your product to arrange for
thier own updates, I guess that kind of update.

How much?

Well, I think Microcom had an income of something like $75,000,000
last year: I'm sure that they could afford the call.  Heck, I just got
a royalty check, I bet I could afford the call (if I call during
evening rates, at least).  But I'll make sure to keep that number
handy for tech support problems...<grin>...

I would like to register one copy of your scan program for usage on
one machine.  How much do you charge?  I'm sure that there are lots of
other people watching this exchange trying to figure out how much a
similar license might cost them.  How much?

Is it normally this difficult to register one of your products?

  Granted, that to me sounds like the Hi-Tech version of selling
Anthrax...  On the other hand, there are some people in the world who
are interested in how a virus works. (Myself included.)  Yes, this is
not such a good idea to sell a virus, but I would rather have one
arrive in the mail when I'm waiting for it, rather than let it sneak
up on me some night when I'm downloading...  As a matter of fact, I
have asked my friends to save any infected programs they might get,
just so I can try to see if I can un-assemble them and look at how
they "live".  I have a feeling McAffe and others in the same business
have a private "storehouse" of virus code to test their programs on.

Sidenote:  As I was writing this, I thought of a really cruel hoax this could
           be: What if, after getting your $29, they send you a "Demo" disk
           of some program, and just "happen" to forget to state in the letter
           that this disk has a virus.  You run the FREE demo, only to have
           it say in the end that it has infected your hard-disk, and for
           $29 more, you can purchase their disenfectant program...  (Sorry
           if this seems sick--it does to me!--but it's been a long day..)

  Signing off (and Virus free...)

Another method is to work out where the interrupt vector points during
the installation process, when there shouldn't be any virus
revectoring the interrupt, and builds it into the check code during
each boot.

As far as I know, PanSoft's immunise does both. It does a disk reset
(AH=0) and traces until the segment is is ROM. There are a couple of
ways around this, and one method is used already, but not for boot
sector viruses, I think. It involves the virus detecting trace mode
and doing a red-herring jump. This method is best used by viruses
loaded after a few other utilities have, in their turn, taken over int
13 - i.e. not appropriate for a boot sector virus, thankfully. In any
case, the trace-detection method is moderately easy to detect by a few
extra instructions in the anti-virus program, and probably is only
useful in avoiding the virus being seen, rather than the original int
13 location being determined.

By the way, the original poster suggested that the original int 13
vector should be restored, if the bootup checking program found a
problem. It is better to rewrite the correct boot sector (using the
known, clean, int 13 address), and then force a cold boot. There is
toom much chance of some other interrupt (e.g. the timer) being
intercepted, in which case the virus might be able to re-install
itself after being "cleaned" from int 13.

     The Washington Post, describing the investigation of the causes
of recent telephone failures, said on 3 July (I apologize for the
lateness but was on vacation):

     As is common, the press has provided just enough correct facts
and garbled just enough facts to confuse the public and potentially
spread hysteria as to the actual virus threat.  Any real "phone system
expert" presumably is computer-literate and knows the difference
between a virus, a worm, and a time bomb.  A virus may but does not
always contain a time bomb.  It was possible as of the date of this
article (but unlikely) that the phone system failures were caused by a
time bomb, but if so, it was planted as a Trojan

Subject: Unknown Virus? (PC)

Dear Netters :

  One of the computers (PC 386) in my lab was attacked by virus yesterday.
The data in hard disk is damaged. For every two bytes one of them is over-
written with the byte '00'.

  For example,
      origin --->  12 34 56 78 90 12 34 56 78 90
      damaged -->  00 34 00 78 00 12 00 56 00 90
                   ^^    ^^    ^^    ^^    ^^

  Is there anyone known that what this virus is? Since the hard disk is
overwritten, I can't get information from that computer. Is there anyone
seen this before?

  Thanks in advance.

I would like to say that multiple compressions are possible for
someone who desires to do so.  It took me approximatly 30 seconds to
succesfully accomplish a compression with both pklite and lzexe on a
program I had just written.  The method is a trivial method, which
involves no modification of any of the programs and, as I said can be
accomplished in less than 30 seconds.

You beat me to the punch, Dave!  Your mail to Big Blue, Inc. must be
faster than my mail here! <grin>

Here's my coupla bits:

Dear Edward:

Your mother and I are quite disappointed in you: the discussion that
Dave Chess and I (and some others) were having on Virus-L is taken a bit
out of context in the most recent VB.  First, it was not my impression
that Dave was calling for the start of any movement, but was calling
instead for the careful observation of what happens in real life in the
world of the virus sufferer as a means to help us (the anti-virus vendor)
offer a more effective product that is more representative of what really
matters out there.

Note that the first part implies that observation and information is more
important than simply action: marking a virus as extinct may not be an
appropriate action to take if the virus merely pops into "replicant" mode
only once every few months.

A great deal of time is spent (or misspent) by playing with research
viruses, but who am *I* to say that a virus is a "research" virus; I'm
not in every computer-equipped site throughout the world so I can't
judge if a virus is a research virus nor if a virus is "extinct". A
vendor who makes that choice is making it on their own.

It behooves us, as members of the anti-virus community and as journalists
to be careful in our evaluation of the threat of each of the umpteen viruses
collected.  Should a meaningless virus, one that spreads barely if at all,
be included in the evaluation "kit" of VB or other respected journals?

I don't think so, or at least it should be made as meaningless as
possible.

It might be far better to "weigh" the results of such a test against
the results of a survey that lets us know what is really an important
virus in the real world: give a common virus a high weight, a rare
virus a lower weight, etc.  It would make tests far more effective.

Now, this is not to imply that the silly marketing game has no merit
at all, just that the emphasis is wrong and in the wrong place, in my
opinion. Those marketing types, however, know what sells and the "my
scanner can beat up your scanner" type of marketing is still going to
be the most effective as long as journals such as VB continue to
propagate the idea that the more viruses one scans for, the better.
As long as something continues to bring in the bucks, then marketing
is doing their job.

It is a circular problem: the vendors need good test results in VB, VB
needs to determine what sells in the marketplace to know what is
effective and, to the market, meaningful testing criteria.

As an aside, you note in VB that "`selectivity' has partly been
enforced by deterioration in scanner `run times'".  This is not
strictly true: the last version of our own scanner that you reviewed,
VPCSCAN V1.1a had only about 150 virus strings in it; the newest cut
of the code has well over 500 strings and the scan time has
deteriorated only by about 2-5%.

You also comment that the anti-virus field is "not market driven, but
that it is a product of the exhaustive and continuing research...".
This is *not* true at all.  The reason for the continued research is
because the market demands it!  The selectivity issue you bring up is
not going to make our research any less; it would just make the
research into areas that are more meaningful.

In conclusion, although I can appreciate what you said in VB, I
believe that you took Mr. Chess' and my online chatter out of context.
Speaking for myself, and perhaps for Dave a tad, I would not want our
conversation to be used as the reason for selectivity to be the
governing goal as the criteria of anti-virus products.

Do not take this as a fatal flaw in VB, please: please keep up the
good work.  Just be a little more careful in your extractions from
Virus-L in the future -- and your mother and I will be very proud of
you again!

Sincerely,

Ross M. Greenberg
