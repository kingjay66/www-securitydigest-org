	then you also believe that giving everyone a gun and a course
	in ethics (together with the practical training) would have
	kept the nut in Killeen, Texas (just up the road from here)

	I think you are making the old mistake of looking at the
	empty part of a half-full glass ...

	there is a difference between (ultimate) denial of information
	from some who are making an effort to obtain it (because in
	your judgement you "hold doubts" about the intentions) and
	no-holds-barred pushing "problematic knowledge" on the general
	public....

	if you don't see "the fat line", you are more a part of the problem,
	and not so much part of the solution ....

	IMO...

	what is important to spread is "defensive information", not
	"knowledge of offensive techniques"

Let's not hear any more about cencoring information about viri and
concentrate more on ensuring that the people who compose our community
are more responsible with the knowledge that is given to them

	can we ensure (and test) for the ethics, before we give
	the guns away?  And when in doubt, let's do without the
	talents of those that fail the tests - I'm pretty confident
	that is as healthy an attitude as not giving guns to all
	would-be bounty-hunters (and before they even apply for a
	weapon's permit)...

	and let's not forget that computer virus knowledge is more
	like having a bottle full of new Cholera-viri than a six-shooter

In times past, knowledge of a computing technique was always
considered beneficial, now such knowledge has the potential for harm.
The circumstances in which the computer professional finds h**self
have changed. It is time we changed too, and stopped trying to deny
the apparent reality which surrounds us.

	exactly.  so why do you appear (to me) to deny it then?!?

 I hope the disagreement is not with the *facts* as stated in my
 message: "There are more defense variations than ever. There are
 also more viruses than ever. They infect more machines than ever."
 Those facts are a little difficult to disagree with.

 On the other hand, if the disagreement is with the perceived
 *reasons* for the proliferation of viruses:

  > The only reason that viruses have been so successful is that
  > the bulk of the 50 (or is it 70) million PCs have NO defenses.
  > Protected PCS are still in the minority (but increasing).

 then I'd have to say that I don't think that's the only reason.
 It doesn't take into account the enormous increase in _new virus
 species_,  which has nothing at all to do with machines being
 protected or not...

 The incidence of infection may be dependent on protection (if the
 protection is effective, a big "IF"), but it has nothing to do with
 the creation of hundreds and hundreds of new viruses whose main
 effect seems to be the eager encouragement of frequent updates of
 the virus scanners.

 Yes, this is an interesting combination hardware-software antivirus
 scheme. Thunderbyte attempts to give users some reasonable features
 that should (and could) have been part of the IBM PC at nearly no
 extra cost in the first place, but aren't.  From this viewpoint,
 it gets my *enthusiastic* support!

 The small card which is part of the package includes some firmware
 (a ROM BIOS extension), including automatic (i.e., software
 controlled!) file-rights based disk-write management ability.
 You have to use certain programs that come with the card.  It's
 really not a true hardware protection device, and some systems
 seem to become unhappy with whatever it is that Thunderbyte tries
 to do to them.  You may have to change DIP switch settings to
 change the place in RAM where the Thunderbyte BIOS code loads on
 booting, and you might even find some programs that overwrite it
 there, causing the card to halt the machine... but in general it's
 an original and worthwhile idea.

 Because it's really a software device (although it looks like
 hardware!), there are ways to bypass it. But it is an innovative
 approach and the two scanners (one resident, one transient) that
 come with it are also fairly effective and extremely fast.

 Personally, I like Thunderbyte, although it's not quite the way I
 would have done things...  :-)  Also, the installation instructions
 leave much to be desired, and the translated English .DOC files are
 sometimes cryptic.

 > Such a thing costs appr. the same as a software package, and
 > it does not depend on updates for new viruses.

 You noticed... yes, that's one of the more interesting aspects of
 hardware and even pseudo-hardware protection... (but the fast
 scanner that comes with it DOES need periodic updates because
 it is, essentially, a signature scanner, though it seems to
 operate in an unorthodox fashion. To be precise, its signatures
 file gets periodically updated.  And in practice, the scanner
 program itself has suffered many frequent updates also.

 > So I want to ask: Is there any experience with such devices,
 > thunderbyte or others ?   Is it worth the money ?

 It's an interesting system but not a 100%-true hardware protector.
 Whether it's worth buying or not must be your own decision. I would
 try to use it `on approval', or at least see it demonstrated in
 detail; if you like it, and it works on your machine, buy it.

 You might also look at PC-cillin, a similar hardware-software
 combination that got a truly bum "report" from the Virus Bulletin.
 (Any faith I might have had in Virus Bulletin's reporting fairness
 died after I saw their vicious "report" on PC-cillin).  It's also a
 useful system, and about similarly priced to Thunderbyte. PC-cillin
 is even easier to install, since the hardware part simply plugs into
 the parallel port, but it's also a not-100% hardware protector, also
 with some problems and also with some endearing features. It, too,
 includes a string scanner and has a device driver that relies on
 information stored on an EEPROM chip in the hardware part to check
 the system at every boot.  It even automatically restores the hard
 disk to clean condition if it finds it was infected by a boot
 sector/partition table virus.  This part is rather neat.

 All these operations, however, both on the Thunderbyte device and
 the PC-cillin device, are purely software-driven. In both cases,
 the hardware is almost incidental.  All of them use software
 methods trying to ensure integrity, and these may be subverted.
 The Thunderbyte author went to some pains trying to encrypt a
 certain version of his scanner to prevent hacking, but it was
 decrypted in the lab almost as soon as it appeared... and the
 "security" and self-test methods used by PC-cillin are quite
 naive.

 Both these systems are interesting, but both need improvement.
 But then, the available software methods aren't any better.

Subject: Stealth and Mutation Techniques (PC)

Some phrases that seem to get bounced around regularly in this
newsgroup, which I have been following for some time, are PC "stealth"
and "mutating" viruses.  I understand that virus detectors like to
find viruses by a signature series of bytes in each version of a
virus.  How does a virus mutate, and how can you detect a mutating
virus?

Although I am a programmer, I know a limited amount about PC internals.
What is PC "stealth" and where can I find out more about it?

 I believe it could happen, and that it could spread, and that it
 could be destructive.  However, I also believe that it would be
 much more difficult to make such virus as deceiving as our current
 furtive ("stealth") viruses, or as difficult to detect.  Also, it
 might not spread as quickly, nor as widely, since only machines
 using a specific program (e.g., dBase) would be vulnerable to it,
 not all DOS machines as is the case now. (But in a related
 exchange between Padgett Peterson and myself, I hold the opposite
 view... <grin> which only goes to prove that one can always develop
 at least two opposing viewpoints for every subject).  Specific
 measures, tailored to the dBase environment, would be a lot easier
 to devise than DOS-universal defenses.

 Finally, I believe that such a virus would be much easier to
 detect and combat from the safety of a write-protected program
 drive, to which the virus doesn't have access, and using low-level
 resources which, unlike the case now, will no longer be readily
 available to the virus.

 So: I believe that such interpreted viruses would be *much* easier
 to combat than the current crop. Those, Fred's machine can defend
 against {ather neatly...

 (However, Fred has never seen an "interpreted" virus and would be
 interested in trying one on his machines, if one exists somewhere.
 Has Mark Pilgrim ever seen one?)

 It would have been so interesting to learn *why* Padgett thinks so.
 Someone (especially myself!) might disagree with such conclusion,
 but not knowing the reasoning that led to it, one remains cheated
 of the opportunity to see things from his perspective...

 ( If that's the only kind of hardware solution one can envision,
 then it must indeed seem so ).  It may be `possible', or it may be
 `impossible', but the software methods we've seen so far haven't
 been good enough. Being a mildly astute individual, I conclude
 that if the software antiviruses haven't suceeded in defeating or
 even stalling viruses by now, then it might be time to try something
 different. Stronger medicine?  Stronger medicine.

 Searching for stronger medicine, the idea occurred that hardware
 means of protection had never been breached by any virus - and
 never could be. So, candidly, the idea was presented publicly here.
 Result?  Never seen so many nervous software persons trying to
 convince me to abandon discussion of such "outrageous" and even
 "stupid" ideas...

 Yes, if your aim is to install a new BIOS, then you might reasonably
 expect to have to install a new BIOS <g>. I wonder why one would want
 to do such a thing, though...  But darn it, let's put things in
 proper perspective: how much does it cost to buy a software
 antivirus package?   This much:

       AntivirusPlus      $99
       CP Antivirus       $129
       Certus             $189
       Data Physician     $49
       Dr. S' Toolkit     $150
       FluShot Plus       $19
       Mace Vaccine       $99
       Vaccine            $100
       Virex PC           $130
       Virus Cure+        $100
       Virus Guard        $24
       Virucide           $49
       Virus Pro          $50
       Virus-Safe         $63
       ViruSafe           $99
       Viruscan           $25
       Virus Secure       $95
       Vi-Spy             $150

  (From the listings in PC Mag latest issue - I wonder why they
   didn't include Frisk's F-PROT though, at $1 per copy and some
   very good performance.  Maybe Iceland is not yet a recognized
   country for PC Magazine's editors... or maybe they were uneasy
   disclosing the performance of the $1 package vs. $100+ ones.
   Also not included was Washburn's SECURE, another very effective
   package which would have stopped their childish `Totally Hidden
   Virus', nor IBM's VIRASCAN, nor Thunderbyte/TBScan, nor the
   very interesting (albeit scanning) VSTOP, nor VBLOCK nor...
   many others.)

 Anyway, that comes to an average price of $90 per package. Software
 usually needs to be upgraded, and the true cost over time can become
 very high!  Compare that with the quoted one-time price of $70
 per machine and it will become apparent that hardware protection
 (defined by Padgett as "changing the BIOS") may indeed seem rather
 inexpensive.

 Actually, if I buy the higher-priced software packages over a period
 of three years, I would have spent enough money to buy hardware
 protection, a new hard disk and some extra programs!

 However, let me just point out that some (true) hardware protection
 may cost much less than the $70 mentioned for the BIOS.

 Yes, but how can I run tests against viruses that haven't been
 designed yet?  Objections to my incipient proposal have been
 so... vibrant.  I've been told that such a system couldn't possibly
 work, then when I said that it HAD worked, it was said that it
 couldn't be useful against some still-unknown viruses, and now I'm
 taken to task for not testing the system against such still
 nonexistent viruses. ... :-)

 I'm reminded of an old Brazilian tale, "O amigo da Onca" (The
 Leopard's Friend).  Goes like this:

 Two jungle buddies talk; one asks the other what would he do
 if suddenly faced with a leopard. Fellow shrugs his shoulders
 and replies:
   "Oh, I'd just shoot it."
   "But say you haven't got a gun", says the first.
   "OK, I'd kill it with my knife, then", replies the other.
   "Say you lost your knife."
   "Well, then I'd throw some stones at him".
   "Suppose there are no stones around."
   "Then I'd climb to safety on the nearest tree".
   "Sorry, no trees, either...", insists the first.
   "Ahh.. then, I guess I'd run like hell!".
   "Can't - your leg is broken".
 The man looks strangely at the other and asks:
   "Say, that leopard, he must be a real good friend of yours, eh?"

 If somebody wishes to send me some of those famous "interpreted"
 viruses one is hearing about, then I'll be delighted to try
 additional tests. I've never seen one myself, apart from some
 silly batch-file viruses...  Or they can do the testing themselves.
 Still, these wouldn't be "real world viruses" - and objections on
 such grounds would also be valid.  So what am I expected to do?  I
 haven't even fully explained "my system" yet, and I already stand
 accused of not having completed tests against yet-to-be-written
 viruses... sheeeeesshhhh!!   Leopards, leopards everywhere, and
 not even a stone in sight!  But at least my leg ain't broken yet.

 It WAS proof, and it was indicative.  Small-scale proof may
 rightfully be extrapolated. But which other approaches are meant?
 I don't know of any existing software method that is as effective
 as hardware protection. If one exists, it should be implemented
 immediately everywhere! Certainly, the use of scanners hasn't
 stopped the advance of viruses.

 If, however, by "solution" it is meant a "method", then of course
 a method can be designed to prevent infection. As many have
 cynically pointed out, never allowing any input of data or
 executables would prevent infection. I hope we are not playing
 with concepts in this manner.

 Yes, I know you are. I just felt that theoretical objections to
 the basic idea of hardware protection were excessively strenuous.
 From a group of people dedicated to eradicating viruses, I would
 have expected a much more inquiring response...  But I concede
 that my presentation is often confrontational, and may itself
 cause rejection...  :-)  and that the habitue's here are just
 being strict in their analyses.

 That's what *I* thought... requires some retraining of habits.
 Comparable, say, to what happens when changing from having a
 single Drive C: to having both a C: and a D:... or working from
 C: and using A: to save to - a lot less work than changing word
 processors.  But certain kinds of programs (self-modifying)
 present difficulties, just as they do with software protection...

 Absolutely right!  Unfortunately, people may have objected because
 they have a mind set that doesn't allow them to face the issue
 without bias.  To them, `protection against viruses' usually means
 `detection', because that's what they have been doing until now:
 detecting.   Since they also proposed the idea that `detection'
 (or worse, `perfect detection'), was THE right method, it's hard
 for them to switch mental gears and examine the issue from a
 different viewpoint.  Even though `detection' has failed, they
 still cling to it and continue searching for the Holy Grail.

 > Right?

 You most certainly are! When I mentioned "virus-resistant" systems
 here, not one person understood the term except in the context
 of "detection" - a wrong context, still being employed by most. Of
 course, it's not really necessary to "detect" a virus to stop its
 action - just making the machine unsuitable (or even unfriendly)
 is quite enough.

 Precisely.  I never proposed any "virus-proof" method or machine
 - it's not really necessary.  The idea that we must seek absolute
 victory over viruses is questionable.  It's born from a conflict
 between programmers that pits wit against wit, skill against
 skill, ego against ego.   Such conflict aims at unconditional
 destruction of the other side.   But an absolute victory is not
 necessary.  As long as we can prevail from a statistical viewpoint,
 we'll win, both statistically and individually.

 There will be less glory for both sides, but viruses are becoming
 a headache, so let's stop fooling around with them and put an end
 to the darn things.  Using hardware, we can make the world a much
 harder place for viruses to live in.  And that is one way to
 achieve our aim, is it not?

 Yes.

 In reality, hardware protection ENABLES the creation of optimum
 software protection because it breaks the balance of force between
 viruses and antiviruses.  At this time, both have the same tools and
 the same weapons.  Neither can ever win.  But establishing hardware
 protection tilts the balance in favor of software measures and
 against viruses. Once hardware protection is established, it should
 become possible to write fully effective protection code that cannot
 be defeated by new viruses - and without having to first redesign the
 Universe! (or Cohen's theories, which seem only a little less
 imposing... but somewhat less unshakeable.   :-)

 There is no serious implementation of hardware defenses against
 viruses. Most of what the public is offered is either pure software
 or is software-based.  Pure hardware antivirus protection has not
 yet been used.

 Picky, picky, picky.   So it's just a majority, but not the GREAT
 majority.  Adjectives are cheap, especially in this business...

Subject: Thunderbyte (PC) - review available?

Fridrik Skulason mentioned 16 Oct 91 that Thunderbyte was reviewed in
the Sept '91 issue of Virus Bulletin. Is this review available
publicly in E-mail transferable format? If so, could somebody on this
list please indicate to me where and how to get a copy? If only
available in printed form, please would it be possible to send me a
copy or FAX a copy to me == ()31 104362719 ==

Up to digest 4/194 I saw 3 messages about Thunderbyte, mixed negative
and positive. I still have no clear idea about the value of a product
like Thunderbyte compared to software-only strategy. How can we
estimate its effectiveness against 'all' future viruses? One example:
the new Dir II virus does not alter files and uses no interrupts as I
have understood. Thunderbyte is mainly based on detection of file
changes and use of interrupts. So...?!

Thank you for your coopreation,

I do know nothing about SVC 6.0, but SVC 5.0 was isolated in Poland no
later than June 1991. The virus has been written in USSR in 1990.
Also in wild (in USSR) exists simpler variants 3.1 and 4.0.

> techniques!

Again, I can say nothing about 6.0, but 5.0 is not so advanced as
Christoph sugest. The folowing is extracted from Virus Information Card
which will be published in PCvirus this month (sorry for poor english):

Virus infect COM and EXE files and install itself resident in RAM. It is
3103 bytes long. SVC 5.0 can propagate under MS DOS 2.x or higher. If
you try to trace virus with debugger it will reboot system. Sometimes
virus sets Read Only flag (error in code). Infected files are marked by
setting seconds in the file time stamp to 60 and increased in size by
3103 bytes (COM) or 3103-3108 (EXE). Virus always put its own code at
the end of file.

Before infection virus check seconds and (if they are set to 60) read
three bytes at offset 138 (from the end of file). In infected files at
this place always there is version number, i.e. '5.0'. File type virus
recognize by extension. In EXE file virus additionally check first two
bytes against 'MZ' marker. Files are infected during one of the
operation: Load and Execute (4B00), Close File (3E), Open File (3D but
only files on hard disk) and Create File (3C only on hard drive). I do
not know for what reason virus do not infect files if the file name
contains characters 'MM' or 'MB' (maybe protection of author software).
Minimum infected file length is 3103 bytes and maximum is (only for COM)
EDE1 (60897) bytes. Virus intercepts INT 08 and INT 21h and do not use
any tricks to fight any AV software. Virus signature:
E800005E83EE032E8984110C065633D2B484CD215E5681FA901975262E3ABC1E0C (code
taken from the beginning of virus body).

[I skip the algorithm of removing virus from RAM and files, because you
are not familiar with our unique virus identification method.]

Virus keep in its body first 24 bytes of victim program in encrypted
form (simple xor with byte taken from 0C1A relative to begin of virus
code).
You can easily check is SVC 5.0 active in memory. You can call INT 21h
with AH = 84h. If SVC is active you get DX = 1990h and in AX segment of
wirus code in RAM (encrypted by XOR AX,FFFF   XCHG AH,AL).
Virus install itself in RAM by manipulating MCB blocks. It occupies 3376
bytes at the top of RAM.
Virus uses some stealth technic to hide increasing the file size and its
contents. If an file is checked by program called CHKDSK virus does not
make any tricks! Programs of that name are not fooled by SVC in any way
[good hint for AV software writers]. If file is loaded but not executed,
or something is written to the file  then virus cure it and infect again
when file is closed.

I hope this help.
By the way, does any body know how time wasteful viruses are? It would
be interesting to know how many people all over the world waste their
time to study the same particular virus.

Subject: What is CoolCapture? (Amiga)

I have been doing a lot of work recently on all of my floppies using
VScan 5.10 to see whether or not I have an infection hiding in all of
my TurboImploded executables.

I've noticed that a lot of programs read and write to CoolCapture,
etc., even though VScan reports them as clean.  What are the major
points of infection in an Amiga system?  And what do those areas do in
a normal situation?

For example, I have heard of CoolCapture, WarmCapture, ColdCapture,
and one or two other common entry points for viri (RomTagPtr?
KickTagPtr?  I can't remember...).  What do all of these places do
that make them so attractive to virus-writers?
