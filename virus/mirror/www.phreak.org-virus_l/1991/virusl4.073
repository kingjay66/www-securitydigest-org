VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

I would greatly appreciate any information readers may have on how
Stoned is spread, especially in a Novell environment.  Since this is
probably a repeated request please mail replies.  (red@iti.org) Thanks
in advance.

   Well, yes, I suppose you could, but it involves an extra step which
is unnecessary. The other objection I have with self-extracting
archives is that you're stuck with extracting the whole lot, even if
you only want to find out what the !@#$%^&*() thing does. If it's not
a self-extracting archive, you can use a shell like SHEZ (or, even,
just extract the .doc files) and do it much faster and easier.

Subject: Virus help sought (PC)

 I wonder whether anybody can help me please ?

 I have managed to pick up a virus, on a PC, which adds between about
1580 and 1595 bytes to the end of .COM, .EXE, .OVL, and several other
files. Apart from this, there seems to be no other effect to the
system.

 A friend ran a virus checker program on one of the files, which
identified the virus as 'A mutation of the Green Catapiller virus',
but was unable to remove the virus.

 Does anybody have any information on this virus please, or know what
event will trigger it off ?

	Thanks in anticipation,

Subject: New Viruses ? (PC)

Recently, I have received questions from two different people
concenting activities that sound suspicious yet do not match any of
the charactoristics that I am aware of. If anyone has further
information, elucidation would be appreciated.

Oddity #1: Several XT class machines exhibit the following: all Master
           Boot Records (partition table) have 17 bytes written into
           offset ACh-BDh (immediately before P-table). These bytes are
           an executable fragment containing the following assembly code:

           1E     PUSH DS
           07     POP  ES
           BB007C MOV  BX,7C00
           B90100 MOV  CX,0001
           BA8000 MOV  DX,0080
           000000

           I am told that any attempt to replace the MBR results in an
           unbootable machine and if the locations are zero'd using Norton,
           the code immediately reappears.

Oddity #2: Single 386/SX20 found the an unusual MBR which appears to be
           the second half of "something". The MBR will operate normally
           if called with DX=0. If called with a non-zero DX and if a data area
           from offset 03-15 is filled, amoung other activities, an interrupt
           between 42h and 59h will be trapped (which one is found in the
           data region, unfilled in the fragment I received). The code
           has all of the normal error messages and appears otherwise normal
           e.g. no attempt to modify 413 is made.

If any reader has seen anything like this, a reply would be appreciated.

Subject: FRODO (4096) found at NIH (PC)

Just wanted to report that we were recently infected by virus FRODO
(4096) in PC and network server.  This virus apparently was imported
from Israel.  It appears that Norton Anti-virus works well in
destroying this virus.

We would appreciate any more information/comments about this virus
from readers.

AST Research implements all of this.  They included every detail
needed to make a workable system: 1) you can set a boot path in the
CMOS, 2) the setup program is in firmware, so you can change the boot
path if you can't boot, 3) a password can be required to get into the
firmware setup.

Then they added a "feature": if the hard drive won't boot, it will
automatically override your boot path and boot the diskette.  Grr.
Furthermore, if your hard drives are on a SCSI, it NEVER believes you
have a hard drive, so it ALWAYS overrides your boot path.  GRR.  This
is because it only checks the CMOS to see if you have a hard disk,
rather than following the drive parameter table vector to see if
there's a table.  This is /* flame ON */ inexcusable, because there
are tons of disk subsystems, not just SCSI, that have their own
firmware and build their own parameter tables.  This is common
knowledge.

*Sigh*.  They were close...  I think IBM got it all right in the PS/2
firmware.  But you have to buy a PS/2 to get it....

I am looking for information on the Print Screen P-2 virus.  Seems
like there is no cure except to reformat the disk.  If anyone knows of
a vaccine to cure this virus, I would be very thankful for the name of
the vaccine and where I could find it.

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.

>From:    hemmo@machina.hut.fi (Juha Hemminki)
Subject: F-prot v1.13 (PC)

I would like to know why the version of F-chk I have (1.13) wants to
write a temporary file called LZ__TEMP.TMP to DOS current directory.
That happens only when f-fchk scans INST_DSK.EXE from hyperdisk
speedkit. The tmp file is always deleted after scan. Size of the TMP
file si 22888 bytes and it seems to have code from the scanned file in
it.

I would like to know what causes this. None of the virus scanners I
have available has reported any virusinfection. Any suggestions or
information is appreciated
