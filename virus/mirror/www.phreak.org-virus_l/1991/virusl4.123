Subject: FPROT version 1.16 and MS-DOS 5.0 (PC)

Pursuant to the various messages regarding FPROT and DOS 5:

I have run into the same problem.  I have sent a couple of messages to 
frisk with boot sectors and CONFIG.SYS files to look at, but here is a 
summary of my own experiences so far:

The system so far tested is a Dell/PC's Limited System 300 with two hard 
disks.  This machine is connected to a Lantastic network, and 
occasionally is used as a server.

Upon booting from the hard disk, the machine hangs with the "Virus 
Alert!! Int 13 changed" message if F-DRIVER.SYS is the first entry in the 
CONFIG.SYS file, or if it is listed after system commands, but before any 
device drivers are installed.  This happens regardless of whether DEVICE= 
or DEVICEHIGH= are used.

If F-DRIVER.SYS is placed last in the file, it loads and runs normally.  
(SMARTDRV.SYS is one of the device drivers present and invoked before 
F-DRIVER.SYS)

If the system is booted from a floppy disk, F-DRIVER.SYS can be the first 
item in the CONFIG.SYS file.

Subject: Re: Stoned and DIR command (PC)

Several weeks ago I had a discussion of the same problem. One of
my friends told me that he issued DIR command  when  a  diskette
with  Stoned  was in disk drive, and found "RAM-resident Stoned"
message after it....

In fact, the following happens:

As  you  know,  boot sector of any MS-DOS diskette contains some
important information about the diskette  (  number  of  tracks,
sectors/track,  FAT length, number of FATs etc.) There are a lot
of  possible diskette formats and, in order to handle a diskette
properly, DOS should read this info. It ( or HE  ?  )  makes  it
using BIOS disk-read function ( function 02 of  13th interrupt ).

During  this operation WHOLE boot sector of the diskette is read
into some buffer in memory. ( A sector is the smallest part of a
disk you can handle ). Virus code  gets  into  RAM also, for  it
resides  in  the  same  sector.  Surely, it will be found by any
antivirus program during RAM-scanning and you'll  get  a  report
about resident Stoned.

But, which is very important, this code is not being executed  -
it's  dead!  Virus  (  like  any  other  program ) MUST BE GIVEN
processor's control. Virus in executable  program  gets  control
when  DOS  runs  this program. Virus in boot sector gets control
when BIOS startup procedure ( after reset or  turning  PC  on  )
reads boot sector and runs boot program ( as BIOS thinks ).

When DOS reads boot sector in order to find important info about
the diskette it DOESN'T RUN boot code ( it's  naturally  ).  All
the  contents of boot sector are treated as data. So the code of
Stoned which antivirus finds in memory is not  really  resident.
It  just  resides there until a buffer in which it was read will
be overwritten. I'm sure that if, after  making  DIR  on  floppy
disk drive, you perform some actions which require a lot of disk
operations  ( compile some program, for example ) and try to run
antivirus once more, it will not find "resident Stoned".

The fact that Stoned doesn't  get  control  during  DIR  is  100
percents  valid  because if it was given a control, it would run
original boot program after  installing  itself,  so  DIR  would
cause the same effect as Ctrl-Alt-Del....

By the way, I had Stoned crawled to my disks once, and  it  made
havoc  then (because it cannot spread itself to the diskettes of
some formats correctly and spoils directory  record  when  doing
so). Beware Stoned if you use diskettes formatted to 720 K !

In the previous article I've wrote about the actions which DOS
performs when making DIR. Boot sector *IS* loaded into memory.
Although, it can be overwritten during some future work. God only
knows, where DOS have loaded boot sector when you make first test and
was or was not it overwritten when running SCAN...

Virus scanners often recognize infection by checking a signature: some
characteristic piece of code or text string. Say, it checks 5 bytes
beginning from file (or boot sector) offset 25h to be equal to
...smth...  If you fill those bytes with appropriate values and others
with the words of your favorite song, a scanner will show infection
too.  You have accidentally created a signature of Azusa virus...

Hello Mr. Al-Ghazal,

If the Yankee Doodle virus reappears on your system, then you could be
reinfecting yourself by leaving the virus in memory or by overlays
which are not scanned/cleaned because they are not in the default list
of extensions.

The correct method for removing the Yankee Doodle virus is:

1.	Power down the infected PC and boot it off of a clean, write-protected
	DOS Boot disk.

2.	Insert the disk with CLEAN-UP on it and type in:

		CLEAN C: D: E: [DOODLE] /A

	If you do not have D: or E: drives then skip them.  If you have other
	drives, include them as well.  The /A option tells CLEAN-UP to go 
	through all files on the hard disk.

3.	After CLEAN-UP finishes, install the VSHIELD program in the AUTOEXEC
	to prevent reinfection.

With all the news about possible virus infections affecting the
telephone systems I thought it was interesting to find a small article
tucked in the back of the Oregonian Newspaper (Associated Press
story):

Quoted in part:

"an official of the company that made the software, DSC Communications
of Plano, Texas, told a congressional sub-committee that the outages
were caused by a software modification it made in April...the company
modified the software at the request of Pacific Bell."

"the changes were made without subjecting them to the normally
exacting tests, which he (Frank Perpiglia, DSC senior vice president)
called 'an absolute mistake.'"

With all the loud voices that were screaming computer virus, this
seams like a very soft voice that said, 'oops, we were wrong'.  It's
another case of check your hardware and software BEFORE looking for
viruses.

There are good reviews of anti-virus products available for anonymous
ftp, with information posted regularly about them. But it would be
even nicer if there were tubulated summaries, arranged by type, to
make finding a product easier (or helping decide what reviews are
worth downloading). Anyone want to volunteer to maintain an index of
the latest versions (and perhaps a simple weighted score of detection
capability)??

By the way, has anyone ever tried to make anti-virus software aimed at
lab PC's, etc, where the user of the computer might be *trying* to
infect the machine? Obviously scanning utilities are poor choices in
any case, if the user isn't likely to be motivated to run them, but
even automatic, resident scanners are useless with some users unless
they make a lot of noise, or send secret messages to a supervisor,
etc.

It seems to me the security hole is only partially blocked by GUARD.
The hard disk does get infected, and the virus gets one turn at
controlling the computer.  Until the computer is rebooted again, any
disk used is in danger of infection.  And Guard does not warn that
this has happened.  In a student lab environment a virus could do a
lot of spreading in that case.

Could you add a re-boot feature to guard, when a virus is found in the
MBR, so that the virus is then removed from the system as well as from
the MBR?

A second problem: I don't understand how Guard hoped to get around
Stealth viruses.  An MBR virus, when infecting a guard-protected hard
drive, will move the MBR (in this case Guard) to another sector.  When
the computer is rebooted from the hard drive, the virus runs first,
taking control of the INT 13.  Then guard is run, and tries to
re-install itself in the first sector, but the virus won't let it do
so.  This is where I thought you might be doing something new, based
on your previous postings.  Unfortunately I can't test it: the only
stealth virus I have (Empire) locks Guard up.

>Actually, I haven't yet had the opportunity to try DiskSecure 

I'm pleased to see more and more anti-virus tools become available.  I
think Guard is a fine effort, as a "gamma test" release.  But I think
it is important, as virus fighters, that we try to take the current
technology as our starting point, and go beyond it, rather than
redoing what our colleagues have already done. For instance, if anyone
can come up with a good way to remove a stealth virus automatically,
while it is "in control", let me know.  Our labs could use it!

Subject: "Empire" variant C found (PC)

Another variant of the Empire virus has been found.  This one differs
significantly from Empire A and Empire B in two ways:

1. It is not detected by CHKDSK, because it does not tell the system
it is present.

2. On floppy disks, it first checks the floppy format, and hides the
clean boot sector at the bottom of the root directory, rather than 
simply hiding at side 1, sector 3.

I have included my best attempt at a proper posting: maybe others 
can fix any errors it may have.  Padgett or Frisk may have suggestions
for signature scan strings.

- -------------------------------------
Virus Name: EMPIRE variant C
Aliases:
V Status:  New
Discovery: June, 1991
Symptoms:  System crash, possible floppy failures, message.
Origin:    Alberta, Canada
Type:      BPRS (Boot and Partition table infector - resident - Stealth)
           Encrypted. 
Detection: F-SYSCHK, F-DISINF v1.16, DiskSecure, Scan v80  
Removal:   F-DISINF, (for hard drives, and 360k floppies.)
           (I haven't tested other virus removal packages.)
           Cold boot from clean, write-protected floppy, replace MBR
           or boot sector.  

Comments:  Empire C appears to have been designed as an attempt to get
around CHKDSK and other "top-of-memory" testers.  It does this by hiding
where it hopes it will not get overwritten, (64K or 128K below the top of
memory; 9000:0000 or 8000:0000 on a 640k computer) without telling 
the operating system that it is present.  Of course this leads 
to a system crash on the first disk read or write after this memory 
location is used by any program running on the computer.  This
behavior will probably greatly limit the spread of this virus.

On a hard disk, Empire C hides the clean main boot record at cyl 0, head 0,
sector 3. On a floppy disk, the hiding place for the clean boot record
is the bottom of the main directory, which depends on format type:
    --Format--     --location--
    360kb 5.25"   side 1, sector  3 
    720kb  3.5"   side 1, sector  5 
    1.2Mb 5.25"   side 1, sector 14 
    1.44Mb 3.5"   side 1, sector 15
 
As with the previous Empire viruses, Empire C avoids cross-infection by
checking that the first four bytes of the MBR or boot record are EA 9F 01 C0. 

The FPROTv1.16 package correctly identifies the Empire family of viruses.
We use the FPROT package at U of Alberta.  I have not properly tested 
other, virus protection and removal software against the Empire 
family.  I have observed that Scan v80 may identify some of the 
Empire viruses as "Azusa".

Just for the record, the term "virus" (as we use it) was *not* coined
by Fred Cohen.  Cohen's use of it came from his advisor, Len Adleman
(the "A" of the well-known "RSA" cryptosystem).

  Btw, Adleman has published a very formal treatment of viruses, full
of esoteric Goedelian concepts like "partial recursive" functions (not
to be confused with recursive calls in programming) and Goedel number-
ing.  Although I studied these things in Logic courses in my undergrad
days, I've never had the time or patience to wade through Adleman's
article, but if anyone's interested, the reference is:
      L. M. Adleman, "An Abstract Theory of Computer Viruses",
      Crypto 88, pp. 354-374.

  Speaking of the "A" of "RSA", the "R" (Rivest) has just announced a
new one-way hash function, MD5.  Although MD4 has never been broken,
so many people were implementing it, he decided to strengthen it just
to be on the safe side (at the cost of increased execution time), and
the result is MD5.

  Now what's all this got to do with Slade's remark?  Oh, well ....

Subject: Link-viruses in packed, self-extracting programs (general)

Hello folks,

I've not been able to read all of the discussion during the preceding
couple of months, so forgive me if I'm re-hashing an old topic.
Though, Mc Affee's recent announcement of his newest Virus Scanner in
this forum makes me conjecture that I'm indeed bringing up a new
point.

Packing files to save disk storage or to gather them into archives has
long been done on MS-DOS (and probably other systems, as well). Later,
several utilities (e.g. LZEXE) have relieved the user from the burden of
explicitely unpacking his or her programs before running them: those
utilities incorporate the unpacking routine within the packed program
such that the invocation of the packed program will result in unpacking
it into the main storage and running it immediately.

Such utilities have caused some headache to people concerned about
viruses, as a program may be infected before packing--thus obscuring
the virus to classical virus scanners or other anti-virus tools but not
precluding replication nor any other effect of the virus. Meanwhile,
several virus scanners scan both the disk image (for infection after
packing) and an unpacked image (for infection before packing). Now every-
body is happy and feeling safe again.

However, it is not enough to scan in this dual way! Recently, it has
occurred to me that a program may be packed several times with various
utilities, resulting in several layers of packing and possible virus
infection. E.g., imagine the following steps, which typically may occur
with PD software
   1. Program P.EXE is built from it's source-code.
   2. A copy of P.EXE is infected with Virus V1 (perhaps at another site)
   3. P+V1 is packed with self-extracting packing utility U1
   4. U1-packed (P+V1) program is transmitted to another site
   5. U1-packed (P+V1) program is infected with virus V2
   6. U1-packed (P+V1)+V2 is packed with utility U2
   7. U2-packed ((U1-packed P+V1)+V2) is again infected with virus V2.
Now we have three infections with two different viruses in three layers
of packing (one "external" and two "internal" layers), viz.
U2-packed ((U1-packed P+V1)+V2)+V2.

Naive scanners will only spot and possibly disinfect the unpacked
("external") instance of V2; running the program--even the disinfected
variant U2-packed (U1-packed (P+V1)+V2)--will result in propagating
both V1 and V2.

More advanced scanners will also spot and possibly disinfect the packed
("internal") instance of V2; but (I guess) any state-of-the-art scanner
will miss the doubly-packed instance of V1! With these scanners,
any attempt to disinfect will yield the (still virulent!) program
U2-packed (U1-packed (P+V1)).

What can and should we do about this?

To the user, this is one more reason for my general advice:
  Never exert the "disinfect" option of any virus scanner,
  rather replace all infected programs with clean copies.
However, if the user is presented with a multiply-packed virus (as our
final beast "U2-packed (U1-packed (P+V1))") to begin with, then probably
no contemporary virus-scanner will alert him or her of that virus: the
user will every now and then experience "unexplicable" virus re-
infections.

To the software developer, this observation presents a new challenge.
The principal algorithm for a thorough scanner is easy; it implies
repetitive or recursive unpacking and scanning along the following
outline:
   PROC scan thoroughly
   = (IMAGE given) VOID: ( scan (given)
                         ; IF   packed(given)
                           THEN scan thoroughly (unpack(given))
                           FI
                         )
or, repetitively:
   PROC scan thoroughly
   = (IMAGE given) VOID: ( scan (given)
                         ; LOC IMAGE current := given
                         ; WHILE packed(current)
                           DO current := unpack(current)
                            ; scan (current)
                           OD
                         )
where
   IMAGE   is a datatype to represent program images,
   scan    is a procedure to scan for known viruses,
   packed  is a BOOL-typed function to check for known packing schemes,
   unpack  is a IMAGE-typed function to unpack a program image;
   LOC     declares a local variable,
   :=      assigns a value to a variable,
   PROC    starts a procedure (or function) declaration, and
   VOID    indicates a procedure proper (as opposed to a function).

I hope that this suggestion will be adopted shortly by the major
anti-virus programs.

And I hope, I've got all those brackets right :-)
Best regards
             Otto

I just wanted to express my gratitude to John Norstad of Northwestern
University for his continuing efforts to stamp out viruses and educate
the user community.  I am looking forward to Disinfectant 3.0 (although
I haven't upgraded to system 7 yet). Thanks, John!

By the information of the moscow AV researcher and developer of the
AIDSTST (one of the soviet analogs of SCAN) Dmitry N.Lozinsky there
are 142 viruses in the USSR, and half of them are soviet ones. Most of
them are "student" viruses.

But (!) another moscow AV researcher Dr.Kaspersky speak about a couple
of dozens of soviet viruses, not more. That is much nearer to
my information.

An excellant idea!   I'd be glad to use those names; we should certainly
avoid feeding this person's ego.

(This is also a good reason to continue to call the Dark Avenger
virus "the Dark Avenger virus", rather than doing as the author would
prefer and calling *him* "the Dark Avenger", and his virus "Eddie".)
