Good grief - this question reminds ne of John Carpwenter's "The
Thing", it just will not die.

>>   Is it possible to write a PC virus which installs itself whenever
>> you place an infected disk in the drive and do a DIR command ?

NO, NEIN, NON, NEGATORY - you cannot write a virus to infect when an
uninfected PC does a DIR of an infected floppy disk (unlike the
Macintosh)

I don't care about batch files (which also execute, just
interpretedly), ANSI control sequences (which also execute), or 1-2-3
macros. In order to subvert the DIR command (not that difficult)
something MUST execute and a PC will mot execute ANYTHING without
being commanded to (boots result from a microcoded command designed
into the CPU - part of the reason for the 640k "barrier".

Of course, once resident, code can tell the processor to do anything
it is capable of doing via software, the operating system doesn't
care, and at any time. You want the PC to play "Yankee Doodle" at 5
pm? easy. You want all the letters to fall down in a pile on the
bottom of the screen every half hour ? trivial. But they all must
execute first and that takes human help either by leaving a floppy in
A when booting, or by executing an infected file (.COM, .EXE, .BAT,
.WK1, .SYS, .APP, or whatever).

If DIR could infect, it would be easy for an infected user to say
both/he/it she just put the disk in the drive to see what it was, but
no, they HAD to have tried to run "ASTROT*T" or "Kermit vs the Naked
Nazi Nymphs" or "1ON2" or that un-tested program with the
hand-lettered label in Arabic/Swahili/Kanjii.

While software commands could be hidden in a batch file with sequences
that would prevent reading by TYPE (but not from LIST or even
WordStar) and be passed as an unscannable uuencoded, packed,
compressed file, at some point some person had to tell it to execute
whether or not they knew thay were doing so. Only then can a virus (or
any other malicious software) infect a PC.

Bonnie, please call 919-490-1277 and holler and scream at the folks at
Microcom?  I *know* that there have been many updates to the code in
last year, especially in the last quarter.  If you're a registered
user and you didn't receive a free update to Version 1.2, there is
something *very* wrong.

Version 2.0 has *finally* entered into final beta, and should be
available very shortly: for those who have purchased VIREX-PC
recently, send in your registration card and you'll get a free update
to Version 2.0.

We've disinfected Joshi for quite a while and Egghead selling outdated
code *really* burns my butt: please report the store number to
Microcom as soon as you can? Thanks!

Subject: Ross-bashing

Allright, enough already. So there was a conflict between two SCAN
programs that caused a "false positive" when one was run immediately
following another.  This is nothing new to the anti-virus industry, a
few months ago two products much closer related than Vir-X and
whatever the other one was consistantly reported the "12-Tricks" when
run one after the other. Until recently when memory scanning became
de-rigeur, and thank goodness it did, no-one bothered to clean memory
following a scan.

Remember the Prodigy STAGE.DAT controversy a few months ago ? It all
started when someone scanned the disks before installing the *P*
upgrade and discovered a host of virus names and strings inside the
.DAT file. Why ? My thought is that *P* needed to create a contiguous
fixed-size file on disk and did it the simplest way possible: by just
creating a giant memory buffer (without putting anything in it) and
copying it to disk to create the STAGE.DAT file. Whatever happened to
be in memory at the time was just swept along. Since a scanner had
just been run that left all of the strings in memory, this became
STAGE.DAT.

Now clearing free memory is trivial, one easy way would be for a
scanner to clear memory before loading, but then if a virus was
present a) the system would probably crash and b) you would not get a
virus report.

I fully expect the next generation of anti-virus tools to be able to
disconnect a virus from memory when found (if it can identify it, it
should be able to remove it and at least determine if it is active or
not).

On the subject of encryption, I agree with Ross, a trivial one is
sufficient to avoid false positives at least until signatures reach a
significant portion of the number of ten-byte signatures - on the
close order of 10^24 - which should take a while. To keep them
encrypted at all times except when individually used would cause an
extreme preformance loss for something that is already slow.

Meanwhile, the real key piece of information seems to have been missed
- - why the signatures were still in memory. When the second scanner
loaded, it should have overwritten the RAM Ross was using therefore,
for this to happen, Ross's code, when expanded in memory, had to be
longer than the subsequent program.  (why there probably have not been
more "false positives" rather than any deliberate avoidance). I
suspect that the "virus" string found was near the end of the expanded
search string list and the list followed the executable code.

Consequently, there may be an easier way than wiping memory - in a
program you have a choice as to where buffers are placed. If the
decrypted strings were kept in a buffer area at the front of the
program and followed by the executable code that (hopefully) does not
match anyone else's viral signatures, any other scanner that follows
should overwrite all the strings before starting.

Since when loading "high" a quick way to lock up a machine is to use
expanding buffers beyond the file size, these concepts should also be
considered by any memory resident routine.
				Just some thoughts,

Sigh.  Look, I simply didn;t remove the strings from memory.  What's your
point?
=-=-=
Exactly this:False trips cause problems for both you and the person
whose machine if falsely diagnosed as being infected.  Such false
trips cost both of you income. A point which, given the release info
I've just gotten on v1.5 you tend to agree with. You say:

Actually, it just showed that our beta testers did not run into that
problem (recall that the reports I mentioned above were limited in number).
This implies that they don't use one of our competitor's products. So what?
There are many people who opt not to use our competitor's products.

The ` so what' is that many others /do/....

Allow me to explain that one of the things I do for a living is such
testing.  IMHO, interfacing with other, similar products , where
possible, (even if only for direct a/b comparison) is part of a
complete test.
 You say:

And, sometimes, a minor mistake is make and is blown way out of proportion.

Sorry, Ross, if you thought my posting was blowing your error out of
proportion, but I honestly don't see how. Recall, please, that this
thread started with a general post was directed at all of us for input
on a specific problem.

My intent was not to attack a particular program. (Indeed, the names
of the packages the author mentioned were one point I didn't even
consider.... ) but rather, my intent was a general answer.

Good hearing from you.

Padgett is right.  To infect a PC, viral code must be executed from
the medium on which it is stored.  The DIR command does not execute
any code from the disk or diskette it is viewing, but just displays
the information contained in the sectors of the requested directory or
subdirectory.  Therefore, if you do a DIR of an infected diskette on a
clean PC, there is no way to infect the PC.  Someone else has
mentioned the possibility of renaming a file to contain ANSI.SYS codes
for remapping the keyboard, but this would not be transparent to the
user, as the remaining information (date, time, and size) would be
shifted to the left.

While this arguement has some validity, I would suggest that it only
serves to reinforce a point made before in this forum, and which I
very strongly emphasize in my seminars and consulting.

The "my scanner is better than your scanner, nyaah" school of
evaluation misses a vital point: any two scanners are better than
either alone.  Even though I feel that Ross's product is one of the
best on the market, and I use it myself for my own testing and
protection, I would hate to see the day when it became the only one
available.  As Ross has pointed out, no matter how well strings are
encrypted, eventually someone will break the code, and then it is a
trivial matter to write a virus that circumvents that package.
However, with a number of scanner packages on the market (and even I
don't have them all), the author of a virus can never know which
package his code will have to go up against.

NO!  Stoned does NOT act that way.

At least if I am understanding the question properly.  If I am, then
the virus is impossible.

Let me make sure I understand.  We have booted from some drive, C, and
are now, after the COMMAND.COM from C has been loaded, doing a DIR on
some infected disk, A.  The question is, can the infected disk A,
infect C.

NO.  The code that is being executed is in RAM, not on drive A.  Without
executing any code from A, we cannot invoke a virus.

STONED works by executing the boot sector on the infected drive A, but
this can only happen at boot time, not by executing a DIR command.

Macintosh's CAN infect C from A in the above case, because inserting a
disk executes the DESKTOP program on that disk.  If the DESKTOP on A
is infected, getting a listing will give you the virus  (WDEF usually!)

Subject: MacAfee Products (PC)

We investigated the issue of a license agreement with MacAfee, and it
turns out that they will issue a "group" license limited to ten users
who would have the right to do a virus check of the various LANs and
all their stations.  In other words, ten lab managers would have
unlimited right to use the product once we pay a $1500 fee
(approximately). At the same time, we are allowed to distribute the
product as shareware for individual users.  My interpretation: I
cannot use the product, except on a single station like any other
individual user, since we did not pay for the license, but I can make
it available to others for their personal use, leaving the question of
payment to their conscience.  It also means that I do not "distribute"
the copy to individual users who happen to be the office secretaries
in the various departments.  On the other hand, I do not feel overly
pressured to use this product since F-Prot (we payed the suggested
fee) seems to work just fine.

Subject: Trojan horses in data files

Mac and PC applications that read structured data files might be
tricked into executing a trojan horse by an ill-formed input file.
Given garbage input, word processors, picture displayers, and
spreadsheets sometimes crash by executing an illegal instruction.  If
the bytes making up this instruction come from the data file, the data
file can act as a virus installer.

I don't know if a DIR A: command can be tricked in this way; proving
that it can't be, no matter what's on the floppy in drive A, would be
a hard job unless the code is thoroughly defensive.

I do not believe such a trojan horse data file exists today.
We should
- - change scanners to scan all files, not just code
- - identify applications that are vulnerable to this attack and
  suggest they be repaired or avoided
