The scanners have an unpleasant feature. If someone changes the
signature of the virus, it (virus) becames unfamiliar to scanner. So
the publication of signatures leads to the new versions with new
signatures etc.  Though it is a good question what is better, this
emergency or the self-restrictions in communications ...

Subject: Hardware failures & viruses (PC)

Approx. a week ago I was invited to a computer to find a virus.
Accidental symbols were appearing on the screen every minute or two
ones. The original reason was NOT connected with any virus and lay in
the incompatability between time characteristics of video RAM and
processor plus(?) magnetic anomalies in the athmosphere.  I am very
often disturbed by users who takes hardware failures for a virus. And
some time a hardware problems managed someone to note the presense of
a virus. I think the similar situation was in the case noted by Adam
M. Gaffin last month.  What could we do to help users to distinct
viruses and failures ?  Except scanners, of course.

Virus: "VCS-1.0" (Virus Construction Set Virus 1.0)

As we resently found out, the virus uses a self encryption-method.
The string at 50h and the two filenames are encrypted.

The ***updated search pattern*** is:

Quite right.  David's vendor's IBM rep apparently downloaded the
internal version (at that time numbered 1.51) instead of the product
version (at that time numbered, on a different track, 1.3).  The
now-converged numbering should have (finally!)  fixed this sort of
thing!  So we should soon be able to stop taking up space on VIRUS-L
with it...  *8)

Subject: Virus naming

The trouble with hash codes, or dates, or anything else semi-automatic
is that, when there get to be enough of them, the names start to
become useless.  At IBM, we tried to use number-names whenever
possible early on, but the disadvantages became apparent after not too
long.  If there's a 453 and a 435 virus, for instance, it's Real Hard
to remember which is which!  The same would apply to a #AR657XXL and
#AR567LXL, or a PC Smith 910004 and PC Smith 910014.

Our current rather tentative approach is to use a
generally-non-numeric stem for each virus family, and then tack on a
number or similar object to pin down exactly which object we're
discussing.  So we talk about the "Flip-2343" and the "Flip-2153" (if
I've remembered the numbers right).  The first part helps the human
remember which virus in general this is, and the second part pins it
down.  If it is desirable to have a distinct number of some kind for
each virus (and it might well be at some point), I'd suggest having a
technically- redundant-but-in-fact-very-very-helpful-to-us-
finite-humans human name for each one (or at least each strain) as
well.

Now I'm taking an unusual (for me) risk here, as I'm at home with the
tail end of a nasty cold, and can't verify it, but I'm Pretty Sure
that the standard normal everyday Stoned virus spells the word with an
"S" ("LEGALISE").  There are also many cases in which the word
"MARIJUANA" has been overwritten (probably, I am told, by hard disk
controllers that keep some data in an "unused" part of the master boot
record, and overwrite that word in the process).  So my guess would be
that you have the normal vanilla Stoned virus, and 74B just isn't
seeing it on the hard disk for some reason (have you tried 75 yet?).

A few nits on Jonathan E. Oberg (ph461a04@vax1.umkc.edu)'s basically
sound posting:

I'm not sure what this "primarily" means.  There are in fact more
file-infectors than there are boot-infectors for PC-DOS.

No.  The typical file-infecting virus traps INT 21 calls, which are
DOS, not BIOS, calls.  Boot-infectors do typically trap BIOS calls.
But of course a virus doesn't *have* to trap any calls at all; the
Vienna-648 virus, which was reasonably widespread at one time, was a
non-resident virus that didn't trap anything.

>4. A PC virus is typically only a few dozen bytes long.

The typical file infector is 1000 or so bytes long; a typical short
one is a few hundred bytes, a typical long one is a few thousand.
Boot infector lengths are similar.  I know of only one virus that's
really "a few dozen bytes" (45, I think it is), but it's very unusual.

Subject: STONED Problems (PC)

   Recently a number of people have mentioned STONED infections
trashing hard disks & think that the following is why.

  Today, nearly every partitioning software aligns the partitions on
even track boundarys for simplicity. Since the Partition Table resides
on track (cyl) 0 head 0 sector 1, the balance of this track is usually
left alone and the first partion starts on the next track. However,
this is just convension and not a requirement. In fact FDISK 1.00
which came with DOS 2.x began the first partition on track 0 head 0
sector 2 and has no "hidden" sectors.

   Since DOS version 3.0 came out in 1984, the later convension has
been followed and Norton's DI usually reports 17 "hidden" sectors (all
of track 0 head 0).

   STONED does not bother to check and just copies the original
partition table code to track 0 head 0 sector 7. No problem if this is
a "hidden" sector but disastrous (to DOS) if not. THIS IS REPAIRABLE.

   DOS keep two copies of the FAT (which STONED just overwrote) and
several utilities exist (Norton Disk Doctor is one) that will copy #2
onto #1 if some utility (like CHKDSK/F) hasn't corrupted the second
copy. It can also be fixed manually by someone with a bit of
experience.

   Consequently, I suspect that those experiencing FAT-type problems
had the misfortune to have a drive that was partitioned using "old"
software and then became infected with STONED.

You could get the <MSDOS.SYSUTIL>ANYBOOT.ZIP file from SIMTEL20.  It
modyfies the master-boot record on your PC so that it can boot from
multiple paritions. I did not yet try the program, but from the
sources and the documentation, it seems it would work OK.

On boot, it allows you to choose (by means of functions keys) to
choose which parition will boot.

Another way would be to remove the cabling from the floppies or tell
the CMOS RAM (if you have an AT or higher, but I suppose thats
required for minix) that no floppie drives exist.

<MSDOS.DSKUTL>FDFRM16A.ZIP contains a program that allows un-bootable
diskettes to boot directly from the hard-disk. Maybe that also works
for you.

Hope this helps,

The "Bloody" virus has just hit Germany. (The virus was described
before.)  It was reported to us at our information stand at the CeBit
1991 by a firm from Darmstadt.
	It is fairly stupid, or so it seems, as it doesn't even
maintain a minimal boot record. It therefore creates all sorts of
wierd mistakes and causes floppy disks to become unusable.

I've just started using FPROT in order to determine what I want to
use as virus-protection:  Scan/McAfee products or FPROT.

I've not used FPROT enough to give you an "experienced" comparison,
but there is one major plus in FPROT's favor: F-DRIVER.SYS

I like the "security" that both VSHIELD and F-DRIVER provide against
know viruses.  However, VSHIELD slows the system down (at least mine --
an XT clone) a considerable amount.  I'm tempted to CTRL-BREAK out of
it before gets loaded.  Since F-DRIVER is loaded in CONFIG.SYS, I can't
do that now. :)   Furthermore, programs seem to load faster using
F-DRIVER.  (The problem with VSHIELD's speed probably was related to
me using the /SWAP switch.)

Still, both are quality products.....

None of the products I have received so far will "scan" into files
compressed with other than LZEXE.  I have seen some "front end" utilities
which will "use" SCAN and PKUNZIP (if you have them in your "path") to
scan .ZIP files.

F-DISINF is part of the FPROT package.  The author, Fridrik Skulason, is
available at "frisk@rhi.hi.is".  The file FPROT114.ZIP is available on
SIMTEL, cert and other servers, and should be getting better distribution
now on local BBSes.

In INtegrity, I have been asked many times to make all files
"self-extracting".  I have consistently refused on the grounds that
self-extracting files are an undesirable and unnecessary security risk.

I have received one "freeware" (copyright, but no charge for use) package
from Holland, Thunderbyte Scan.  It has three components, a scanner
(TBSCAN), a TSR scanner (TBSCANX) and a disk boot recovery utility
(TBRESC).  Thus, although it does not have a "disinfect" function, it
will indentify files infected with viri so that they can be replaced with
originals, and it will allow floppy boot sectors to be replaced.

I have also seen a program distributed as VC3-2.ZIP, which contains
version 3.2 of a program called "Victor Charlie", of which version 4.0
will apparently be commercial.  This appears to be "change detection"
software.

Aside from that, I recommend FPROT as the cheapest and best "value for
cost" of all the antiviral products yet reviewed.  frisks "licenses" for
educational use are $1 per computer per year as of version 1.14.

"Antivirus" is an understandably common name for antiviral products.
(Another is "Vaccine".)  Neither of the reviews that you have mentioned
is of the Central Point product, nor is the review of Norton Antivirus
which is somewhere in the pipeline.

The Central Point program is very new, and I have not yet received a
copy, although I have written to the company.

Ken should have eight reviews (of mine, anyway) on file at cert by now.
