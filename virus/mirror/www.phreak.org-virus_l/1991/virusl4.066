  I just received FPROT115.ZIP and installed it.  I found a very minor
glitch: I ran the f-test program, and it reports "F-DRIVER is not
installed or not working!".  I tested it against Cascade, and it is in
fact working.
  I am using DR DOS 5.0 on a Rycom "3060" 80386 with 4 meg RAM;
F-driver is installed with:

device=c:\qemm\loadhi.sys /h/s c:\f-prot\f-driver.sys

The Hitchiker's Guide to Computer Virii entry for the WDEF virus is
"Benign".  Ford Prefect and I would like to change the entry to
"Mostly Benign".  :-)

We have a lot of Mac IIci's at work, and there is a bug in WDEF (yea,
a bug in a virus :-) ) that causes it to crash the IIci when a disk
with WDEF on it is inserted in the floppy drive.  Fortunately, this
flaw means it never gets installed on the IIci, but it can be
frustrating if you don't have some INIT installed that catches WDEF
and removes it before it crashes the machine.

Subject: Trying find a good anti-viral software (PC)

Can someone please help with the following problem?  I would like to
know which of the following virus protection programs are the most
reliable:
	McAfee's SCAN/VSHIELD/CLEAN
	Norton's Anti-Viral program
	Virex-PC
Since I do download quite a bit from ftp sites, I need to protect my
system from viruses.  Currently, I have been using McAfee's VSHIELD &
SCAN programs.  Before I register the programs, I want to know if
Norton's programs are just as good or better?  Registering for the
three McAfee's programs would be more expensive than buying Norton's
program.  I recently missed a sale pricing Norton at $50.  If Norton
is not as good, then I'd rather pay more for the better protection.
So, can someone tell me what is the most reliable software to get?  I
should state that I do use Window over half the time.

Is there something similar to MAC's SAM?  I like how the program
automatically checks any removable disks which has been inserted into
the drive.  Is there a PC version of this software which does the same
thing?

Subject: 3Com Attack? (PC)

The current issue of Network World (April 15th) has a front page item
on 3Com's campus net being hit by a virus (a 5,000 node network).
Interesting article, but nowhere can I find what virus was involved.
Any one have any 'inside' information?

Subject: F-PROT 1.15 - Can't find Stoned (PC)

Hello,

I just downloaded the latest version of F-PROT, version 1.15, from
beach.gal.utexas.edu.  Before upgrading my old 1.14, I decided to test
the new version.  It was able to detect and disinfect
Israeli/Jerusalem, as well as Yankee (TP-44); however, when I ran
F-DISINF on a known "Stoned" -infected floppy, I got the message:
"This boot sector is infected with a new virus."

I then ran F-DISINF from version 1.14, which gave me the expected
"This boot sector is infected with the Stoned virus.  Disinfect?"
message.  Scratching my head, I took a peek at the sign.txt files for
both versions.  F-PROT 1.14's sign.txt had an entry:

Stoned      yMAoWM85aMkPEkvm8p8WVs7NW5H5hk70JqdKUh4YVYCslmfA

While version 1.15's sign.txt had the entries:

Stoned-379  PmAcC5wma5utNjB5R7QqEV2ew8ErtdMmF3wRDKb5o3umMKyY7jVz0mKUakrP
Stoned-fam  PM8oCju535LdT555sd5Km5I40NVsjajLns0Np58WedJu

I added the 1.14 signature into 1.15's sign.txt file, ran F-DISINF
again, and sure enough, it was able to find and disinfect Stoned.

Has anyone had any similar experiences with 1.15?

By the way, I've been using F-PROT on campus here since version 1.10,
and it is by far the best anti-virus program I've tested.

Subject: Manual CASCADE-removal? (PC)

I had for some time a few programmes that were not backup-ed. During
this period, my PC was infected by the CASCADE-1701 *COM-virus. I have
planned just destroying the files; they are not worth as much as the
price of a disinfector; but hope that someone here can assist me in
manually removing this virus.

If this implies a lot of work, I'd rather destroy the files, but if
anybody can help me, I'd be grateful. If you find out that the
workload will be to heavy, please mail me anyway so I can start
deleting...

About 1.5 years ago, our NOVELL network was infected with Jerusalem-B.
What happened was MicroSoft-Word needs to be writable because it can
reconfigure itself for some user options.  What we think happened is
the supervisor ran MSW from a workstation that was infected.  From MSW
the whole company was soon infected.  Since MSW remained writable to
itself, it infected itself 70 someodd times.  The infection was not
detected until a TSR that was being developed in the R&D department
started showing eratic behavior.  It worked fine the first time it was
compiled and run, but never again.

Because of this, and the three weeks it took to clean house, our MIS
department purchased a battery of protection programs and scanning
programs.  We have had no network infections since.

We have been infected by Stoned, Jerusalem-B, Disk-Killer at various
times since then, but only on a limited number of workstations before
it was detected and cleaned.  We have a problem trying to keep suspect
floppies out of our system, since the Taiwan office is always sending
floppies to us and not everyone knows about viral protection.

Its an uphill battle, but so far we are winning.

You know, I've been doubting my own infallibility for the past few
days since Bruce posted the "sorry, but it won't work", so I tried to
send set and the params directly to HC, only it isn't happening, guys.
Now I really would like to put this whole thing to rest, so try it:
Try to send the set command directly to HC and change the script of a
stack.  I have yet to be able to do it.  In other words, the theory
is, of course correct, but it ain't working in practice, and I'm out
of ideas, so please, all ye doubters, try it and then send me your
scripts because all I'm getting are error messages with no results.
Don't send me your ideas, I want working, syntactically correct
scripts.  If they work for me I'll withdraw my previous comments.
Until then, please prove me wrong.

A local Community College I work at was just dropped dead by the FORM
virus (as detected by Norton Anti-virus).  Any help you can throw at
me as soon as possible would be appreciated.  We are entering the
Finals week next week, and students need the units in order to finish
projects.  Either here or e-mail would be greatly appreciated.  We
have identified about 150 machines that are infected, and hope to find
a fix.  We are fairly much novices when it comes to dealing with
viruses, so any info from the simple to the technical will be
appreicated.

[ someone writes lots of babbling about lawsuits and such for an april

If people lack knowledge about the things they're reading and in
general take everything they read from newspapers as the Truth without
checking it first with someone competent enough to know what's it all
about, in my opinion they deserve all what they get.

You're in much more trouble than some lost time if you blindly believe
anything you happen to read in a publication.

It seems to me that especially in the computer virus field the lack of
knowledge about computer security in general is often exploited by
various venturers.  Sure, there's nothing inherently wrong with
wasting your money spending it on various virus detection programs,
populist books and such.

Computer viruses in themselves are not a big problem.  The big problem
is persons with no knowledge of the risks involved and no proper
training and/or usage policies using computer systems with nil (or
worse, security-by-obscurity ones) operating system and application
program access controls, with the programs often written by persons
with equal lack of knowlegde.  Add to that the lack of source code and
then even if the users were competent enough they couldn't find or fix
the holes and lacks of controls.

Consider yourself lucky not to be dealing with virus.  We now *have*
to scan publically used machines daily at this university.
Personally, I find "ping" or "stoned" (now being reported as
"stoned/swedish") being brought in on students' floppies.

An error was discovered in version 1.15 of F-PROT.

Symptoms: F-TEST would report that F-DRIVER was not installed or not
	  working, when in fact it was.

Reason:   F-TEST was locked by F-XLOCK, but it should not have been.

Fix:      Either just give the command

		F-UNLOCK F-TEST.COM

	  or replace the F-TEST.COM with the following program.

Subject: LANs vs. viruses

There has been some renewed talk recently about viruses infecting
LANs.  I would just like to toss in the following observation.

LANs (specifically LAN file servers) are, in essence, multi-user
systems.  As with other multi-user systems (e.g., UNIX), there are
many administrative issues involved with virus protection in addition
to the basic integrity of the LAN operating system.  Most importantly,
file and directory protections become critical.  A single
world-writable and publicly available file can quickly become a vector
for a virus without the virus having ANY knowledge that it is indeed
infecting a LAN; most LAN interfaces are, after all, designed to look
just like DOS to the average application program and to the user.

Also, privileged users can bypass file protections.  If a privileged
user executes an infected file, the LAN may become infected - again
without the virus having any knowledge that it is infecting a LAN.

These issues are CRITICAL!  Before we jump to conclusions about any
LAN being susceptible to a virus, we must very carefully examine all
of the possibilities.

Cheers,

Ken van Wyk
