Subject: Disinfectant 2.5 Confusion (Mac)

I apologize for all the confusion regarding Disinfectant 2.5. Some
time ago, when problems appeared with Apple's Compatibility Checker, I
made the mistake of saying that "there will be no version 2.5." Then
the new ZUC C virus appeared, and I released version 2.5! I had
forgotten about the possibility of a new virus appearing before I
finished my new verison 3.0 when I made the earlier statement.

We debated naming this new 2.5 version 2.4.1 or 2.6 or something else
for just this reason. I decided that there was going to be confusion
no matter what I did, so I just named it 2.5.

Subject: Self scanning executables (pc)

    Just in case this may be of interest to someone, I am sending out
this little code segment. I have added a call to vscan() right at the
beginning of main() in a couple of programs. vscan() should (in
theory) be able to tell if the program has been attacked by a virus
and report it to the user.
    Let's face it, most users don't want to have to check their
systems for viruses. I think one alternative might be to have our
programs start checking themselves. This should make it quite a bit
more difficult for virus writers to cause much trouble. Also, the cost
isn't very high. This thing seems to run pretty fast, and it only adds
282 bytes to the size of the executable.
    If anyone out there has access to some viruses, I would appreciate
it if you would give me some feedback on how well this thing works.

     I'd really like to see a review of this product.  Perhaps, Mr Slade or
Mr. McDonald could provide another of the excellent reviews they have written.
With something this new that plays with a crucial part of my OS, I'd like some
more opinions before trying.  (Translation:  I'm not going to try it, you try
it.  Hey!  Let's get Mikey...)  I'd test it, but I don't have a spare hard
drive lying around...

Frodo/4096 is a "stealth" virus, and so this behaviour is perfectly
understandable.  While the virus is in memory, it will "mask" any
infections on the disk, making it impossible for a scanner to find the
infected file.  (I don't mean to imply that DMDrvr.bin may be the
infection, but if you look at its size while the system is infected, it
will not show any change in size either.

It appears that something in your boot sequence is infected, since you
don't get the warning of an infection in memory when you boot from the
floppy.  Boot from the floppy, therefore, and *then* run FPROT.  (Of
course, if you have been running FPROT from the infected system, it may
be infected as well.  Perhaps it would be a good idea to get a clean copy
if you can.)

I received that following message from one of the members of INtegrity on
SUZY:

== E-Mail > > Karges, Stephen ==

  Subject: Virus Reseller

  Robert, I was on a Board (CRS) in a friends mail box and I found
  a person had uploaded a message similar to the following.

  Anyone wishing to buy Virus and source code please mail $7.00 for
  a 360k disk full or $10.00 for a 1.22mb disk full. The address to
  mail payment to was:
      West Coast Virus Centre
      101 Shady Hollow Drive
      Scarborough, Ontario
      M1V 2L9

  This type of thing frosts me. Is there anything that we can to do
  put this type of person out of business. There is in fact listed
  in the postal code book an actual residental address.

  Please forward your thoughts.

  Steve Karges
  Neutron Computers

My first thought is "A WITCH!  BURN 'ER (or him)!".

My second thought is, first make sure it's for real.  It is, of course,
quite possible that someone has posted this message as a hoax, in order
to make trouble for the residents at said address.  This can be
ascertained by anyone who lives in Scarborough, or likely by the
operators of CRS (Canada Remote Systems, a local commercial BBS in
Toronto.)

Once that is determined, the first step should be to demand that CRS
remove this account.  I would think they would be amenable, since this
message is definitely counter to their best interests, but in case they
hedge, a suggestion that the (paying) users of the system do not
appreciate this might be all that is necessary.

The name of the individual concerned should be publicized, in order to
ensure that he or she is persona non grata on all possible BBS and email
systems.

The post office and telephone company should be alerted to the use that
this person is making of their facilities, and of the fact that the
computing community objects in the strongest manner to such activities.
While the legality of such actions are open to question, "community
standards" of behaviour may apply here.

Some will question the fact that I have publicized the address here:
after all, we are quite sure that some virus authors read this list.  I
would replay, as has been suggested in the past, that they will likely
obtain this information anyway, and we have little to gain, and much to
lose, by suppressing it.

- ------

On a different subject, my recent posting regarding the two versions of
the SCANV80.ZIP file that were available from different sources was not
sufficiently clear.  It was never my intention to suggest that either
McAfee Associates or Keith Peterson were in any way at fault.  I failed
to stress the fact that I found absolutely no evidence of any problem
with either file.  Both McAfee Associates, in maintaining SCAN over the
years, and Keith, in maintaining the largest and most valuable source of
shareware that I am aware of, deserve only our thanks, and I apologize
for generating this misunderstanding.

Two (or rather 3) possibilities.

1) The original infected program is not scanned, because it has been packed
   by LZEXE, DIET, AXE, TINYPROG, PKLITE or EXEPACK.  It is becoming ever more
   popular to distribute viruses this way - a very effective way to hide the
   first generation sample - It will not be detected by most scanners although
   later generation samples are detected normally.  Try running version 1.16
   and check if it reports any packed files.

2) The virus is active while you are running the scanner, so the infection
   is not found - this does not seem to be the case, as you described
   the circumstances.

3) The virus is present is some other file which is read and may be found in
   memory.  It is not well known, but Frodo will "infect" any file where
   the sum of the ASCII values of the file extension is 223 or 226.  In
   addition to .COM and .EXE files, this includes .OLD .MEM .PIF .QLB
   .DWG .LOG and .TBL

   This can be checked by using the /ALL switch - or /A for SCAN.

Might be - but without more information (such as a dump of the boot sector
and the PBR) it is hard to tell.

Anyhow, viruses can easily do something like this.  I was running one recently
(on one of my test machines) and it managed to corrupt things so thoroughly
that I was not only unable to boot from the hard disk - I was unable to boot
from a diskette unless I unplugged the hard disk first!  When the computer
had booted from a diskette I was able to plug the hard disk back in and
reformat it.

As this behaviour was rather unexpected I tried this particular virus again,
with the same result.

Don't forget the Pop-up alert messages - they are included in version 2.0
of my program, along with the shadow boxes.  :-)

But of course you can use the command-line interface if you want to - I guess
that applies to you program as well...right ?

But, what about:

	Overwriting viruses, which destroy the programs they infect

	"Companion" viruses, such as AIDS II and TPWORM, which do not
	change the programs they "infect".

	viruses which replace the victim, and include its functionality

Subject: Re: sideshow on doom2:reply (PC)

My opinions on signature encryption:

I use two types of encryption in my program.  Signatures on the disk are
encrypted using a fairly simple algorithm, which would be easy to break
in a day or two by a determined hacker.  Nevertheless, I still find it
worthwhile to use this simple method.

    - Anybody trying to modify a virus so it is not detected by a scanner
      can very easily do so if the signatures are not encrypted.  By
      encrypting them (and by using two signatures per virus) I make this
      a bit more difficult.

    - It would be pointless to use a more sophisticated encryption - I could
      encrypt the signatures using DES, for example, but my scanner would
      have to include the decryption routine as well as the key, so it would
      only mean slightly longer time needed to attack the signatures - no
      real improvement in security.

    - This makes it more difficult for anybody to take my set of signatures
      and use them in a different product.  I spend considerable time selecting
      two good signatures for each virus, and I do not like anyone using
      my set of signatures in a competing product.

Signatures in memory are encrypted in a trivial way - just so I don't have to
worry about any other scanner finding them in memory after my program has run.

I believe I more-or-less agree with what Ross had to say on the subject.

The answer is the same for the Amiga.

While a virus could infect the DIR command, and then infect write
enabled disks if you did a DIR (using the infected command), there is
no risk of BECOMING infected by using a clean DIR on an infected disk.

In order to become infected, you must execute the virus code, either
by booting off an infected disk for bootblock viruses, or by running
an already infected program.

Given a clean system, reading from an infected disk (by DIR or other
means) is safe. booting from, or executing something from, an infected
disk is where the danger lies.

    At the time, the System 7 compatibility checker was wrong.
However, since then Disinfectant 2.5 HAS been released, despite John
Norstad's earlier claim that it wouldn't be.  He updated Disinfectant
so that it would be System 7 complete and so that it would deal with

In Virus-L V4 I060, Eldar A. Musaev started to clarify the terminology
by classifying malicious software by differences in function.  I
expanded on that in Virus-L V4 I071.  Tim Martin corrected some of my
terminology in Virus-L V4 I072.  Finally, postings from several people
caused me to correct my spelling of the plural of "virus."  The
correct spelling is "viri," according to the rules of spelling in the
Lincoln Library of Essential Information (my dictionary doesn't have a
plural listed for "virus").  The digested and corrected definitions
follow.  Comments, additions, and further corrections are invited.

- - --------------------
Malicious Program Definitions

The functional criteria for classifying malicious programs are:
I.   Replication
     1.  Non-replicator
         A program which does not copy itself.
     2.  Dependent Replicator
         A program which copies itself only when the host program is
         executed.
     3.  Independent Replicator
         A program that, once started (e.g. TSR), could copy itself
         continuously without outside assistance.

II.  Host Basis
     1.  Standalone (non-host-based)
         A program which does not require another program to help it
         run and/or spread.
     2.  Host-based
         a.  Spawning
             A program which leaves the host program intact, but runs
             before the host program and calls or "spawns to" it.
         b.  Overwriting
             A program which overwrites a portion of the host program
             or deletes and replaces it entirely, so that it is run
             instead of the original program.
         c.  Parasitic
             A program which attaches itself to the host program,
             leaving it functionally intact.

If the term "virus" ("viri") is used for host-based dependent
replicators, and "bacterium" (plural "bacteria") is used for host-
based independent replicators (for lack of better terms to separate
the two), the resulting classifications and associated names are:

I.   Standalone Non-replicators
       Trojan Horses            Example:  ARC 5.13
II.  Spawning Non-replicators
       Spawning Trojans
III. Overwriting Non-replicators
       Overwriting Trojans      Example:  Twelve Tricks
IV.  Parasitic Non-Replicators
       Parasitic Trojans

V.   Standalone Dependent Replicators
       Replicating Trojans      Example:  CHRISTMAS EXEC (BitNet)
VI.  Standalone Independent Replicators
       Worms                    Example:  Morris Worm (Internet)

VII. Spawning Dependent Replicators
       Spawning Viri            Example:  Aids II
VIII.Overwriting Dependent Replicators
       Overwriting Viri         Example:  382 Recovery
IX.  Parasitic Dependent Replicators
       Viri                     Example:  Vienna

X.   Spawning Independent Replicators
       Spawning Bacteria
XI.  Overwriting Independent Replicators
       Overwriting Bacteria
XII. Parasitic Independent Replicators
       Bacteria                 Example:  Jerusalem

Some of the resulting combinations don't have examples of which I'm
aware at this time, and some of those (such as a parasitic non-
replicator) are not likely.  Also, some people may say that the Lehigh
virus is an overwriting virus.  I would call it parasitic, since it is
not a complete program by itself, but attaches itself to COMMAND.COM,
even though it overwrites the stack space.

Subject: Stoned virus and DIR command. (PC)

Discovered several grad students had diskettes infected with Stoned.
Experiments confirmed that a DIR command on these diskettes caused
Stoned to become resident in RAM.  I do not know how or when Stoned
moves to the fixed-disk partition sector/boot record.
Does this pose special problems for virus hunting & removal?

This is not just Ross's opinion. His program must be able to be
publicly disseminated and be able to decrypt itself without the user
providing any sort of key. What he is doing is hiding it from casual
observation, not trying to deliver an unbreakable code (literally for
semantics buffs, encrypting not encoding), unbreakable code cannot be
produced given these ground rules so why should he try ?

Not a valid point. With encrypted strings, the "bad guys" still have
to either de-crypt the code to find the trigger string(s), assuming
there is one, or just keep trying variations to find one that will not
trip the scanner either as itself or as any other virus. Given
algorithmic signatures (not completely string related), this can be
much more difficult than with a simple string scanner.

This at least requires significantly more work for the "bad guys" than
if the string were available "in clear".

Besides, in the future I expect more scanners able to say "I cannot
identify this file but it sure looks/acts suspicious". The early stuff
that tried to provide such warning was just too granular and tripped
too often, this does not have to be true today.

Disinfectant 2.5.1
==================

July 7, 1991

Disinfectant 2.5.1 is a new release of our free Macintosh anti-viral
utility.

Version 2.5.1 corrects an error in the version 2.5 INIT which caused
some programs (e.g., CompuServe Navigator) to crash on Macs using the
Motorola 68000 processor (the 512KE, Plus, SE, Classic, and Portable.)

Version 2.5.1 also corrects an error in the 2.5 program which could, at
least in theory, cause crashes or hangs during program startup or when
you try to do a scan.

We apologize to everybody for the inconvenience caused by these errors in
the 2.5 release. The errors are serious, and we strongly urge all
Disinfectant users to obtain the new version 2.5.1.

Disinfectant 2.5.1 is available now via anonymous FTP from site
ftp.acns.nwu.edu [129.105.113.52].  It will also be available soon on
sumex-aim.stanford.edu, rascal.ics.utexas.edu, comp.binaries.mac,
America Online, CompuServe, GEnie, Delphi, BIX, MacNet, Calvacom,
AppleLink, and other popular sources of free and shareware software.

Macintosh users who do not have access to electronic sources of free and
shareware software may obtain a copy of Disinfectant by sending a self-
addressed stamped envelope and an 800K floppy disk to the author at the
address given below. People outside the US may send an international
postal reply coupon instead of US stamps (available from any post
office.) Please use sturdy envelopes, preferably cardboard disk mailers.

People in Western Europe may obtain a copy of the latest version of
Disinfectant by sending a self-addressed disk mailer and an 800K floppy
disk to macclub benelux. Stamps are not required. The address is:
