Subject: Yet another virus! (PC)

 I recieved a call on Jan 29, 91 from a local pc retailer.
 They seemed to have a virus.

 This is what I was told:

 1) it ``appeared'' about a week ago.
 2) any access of an uninfected disk infects it.
 3) infects any version of dos, he said that ``4.01 was worse''
 4) infects a 386
 5) warm boot infects.
 6) infects all disks 1.2M, 5 1/4, 3.5, and hard disks.
 7) formating a 1.2M disk on an infected machine will format the
    full disk 100% complete, and then returns a Invalid Media or Track
    0 bad.  Formating the exact same disk with an uninfected system
    the format completes successfully with no errors.
 8) McAfee's(sp) scan V72 does not detect it
 9) f-disinf version 1.12 July 90 says:
   ``This boot sector is infected with a new version of the  virus.''
   (no name).
 What I have done and ``know to be true''

 1) A fresh copy of Scan V72 and AVSearch 2.21 from the wuarchive
   does not detect it.
 2) I watched them do 7, 8 and 9 and I duplicated 8  on my own equipment.
 3) If I try to boot an IBM PC Portable (lugable) (8086) 2 floppy) no
   hard disk. The drive light comes on to do the boot and it never goes
   off. A ctrl-alt-del does not do anything.
 4) If I try to boot an IBM PC (original) (8086 ) 2 floppy) no
   hard disk. The drive light comes on to do the boot and it goes
   off, no boot, no error message. If I then stick in an clean
   bootable floppy and ctrl-alt-del it will boot and not infect the
   clean floppy.
 5) The person said that the disk I had could boot a clone, but it would
   not boot a true blue IBM 8086, it might boot a 386 didn't try.
 6) f-disinf version 1.13 says:
   ``This boot sector is infected with a new version of the Stoned virus.''
 7) f-disinf version 1.14 says: (not a quote)
   This is not a typical boot sector and could be a virus.


  I contacted Kenneth van Wyk and after exchanging a few notes etc
  I recieved a confirmation that it was a new virus.

  Fortunately the mdisk suite of utilities appears to clean up this
  virus.


   Anyway to make a long story short. We appear to have a brand new
 boot sector virus. As far as a name, I suggest 910129 as the
 date of first appearence.  There is no ascii text in the boot
 sector. An ugly name and if anyone has a better suggestion thats
 ok.  I do not have a machine that I can get an active virus to run on
 such that I can test it.

 I just recieved the following note from Ken

   I would like to express my thanks to Kenneth van Wyk
   for his assistance in tracking this down and also for VIRUS-L

   Thanks all .

 P.S. if you want to contact me about this please feel free but NOTE
   1) I will not send a copy of the virus to people who ask unless first
      oked by ken.
   2) I will be on vacation for the next two weeks.

If anybody's interested, there is such a program avaliable, i.e. stops
hard disk boot viruses early in the start-up sequence. If anyone is
interested, I can e-mail further details. It's a companion product to
an automatic diskette boot sector scanner.

Subject: Re: Hardware damage?

While the existance of the HCF assembly command (Halt and Catch Fire)
has been debated, :-) I seem to remember a discussion similar to this.
I believe the basic conclusion was that it is impossible to damage the
CPU itself through programming.

However, peripherals remain very vulnerable- if you take a standard
hard drive, and drag the R/W head across the media 4 or 5 thousand
times, it can't be good.  While it is unlikely that any user would
allow the machine to sit there grinding for several hours, it is
possible to write to virus to add 2 or 3 full head sweeps to each disk
access.  This would slightly slow up the response time of the drive,
and might make it wear out much faster.

I saw a computer anecdote about some guys who had access to a printer
where imprints of the letters were layed out sequentially along a
linked chain.  The chain spun laterally in front of 80 hammers, which
would strike, when the right character was in the right position.
These fellows found out the sequence of the letters, and attempted to
send that string to this printer to see what would happen.  They said
that there were finding parts of the printer in the corners for many
months.

If one were to come up with a well sequenced access drive request,
timed with the drive speed, and in sync with the sector interleave, a
similar effect might be possible.  However, as in the story, much
advance knowledge about the hardware is necessary.  Unless the
hardware configuration is VERY public, it would almost have to be an
inside job.  Writing enough code to screw with every HD, and every
printer around would make the virus big enough to be easily detected.

I think there may be ways to screw with the refresh rate of certain
brand monitors, but again- that requires inside knowledge- then there
is no reason to use viral propagation- a trojan horse will do fine.

>From:    THE GAR <GLWARNER@SAMFORD.BITNET>
Subject: Apologies to Sim (Mac)

I would like to make a public apology to Simware, and especially to
Greg Bisaillon at Simware, regarding the note that I posted previously
on this list.

I fear that I have caused his company some damage by the posting, an
excerpt of which follows:

**************************************************************************
Date:         Mon, 28 Jan 91 16:52:31 CST
>From:         THE GAR <GLWARNER@SAMFORD>
Organization: Samford University Computer Services
Subject:      SimWare 3.1

BUT . . . SIMWARE's "SimMac 3.1 Application Disk" (Master Program), which
I received on or about Jan 11 was infected!  SAM reports that it was last
altered on 12/21/90 at 12:55 PM.   This INFURIATES me, as I had up until
today always trusted the programs that come straight from the manufacturer
sealed in the "Read Carefully BEFORE Opening" license envelope!

************************************************************************

Greg Bisaillon contacted me from Simware, and together we checked our
respective shipping logs.  It seems that the package WAS at Samford on
Dec 21!  The first time that I used the disk on my machine was not
until early January, however it was used in ANOTHER Mac before it came
to mine.

This Mac must have been the infector, NOT Simware.

I was unaware that this had occurred, as the disk was in its envelope
when I received the disk.  All my packages are opened by the person in
charge of our purchase orders, so it did not bother me, I had assumed
it was open so the shipping invoice could be removed.

Having spoken with Greg, I have come to understand what a thorough and
outstanding job of quality assurance they provide at Simware, with
each disk being checked with SAM and Disinfectant some four times
before leaving the premises.

I again would like to apologize, and hope that Chris Radziminski, and
the MacWeek people are still reading this list, as both had expressed
concerns to Simware.  I have always despised the rumors that went
along with the software business, and now I have unwittingly started
one!

[Ed. Thanks for setting the record straight, Gary!]

Not strictly a virus, but as to software damaging hardware it was true
under Windows 2.1 and WordPerfect 5.0 that running grab.com to capture
an Paint image from the screen caused VGA monitors to snap, arc,
oscillate, and (if you didn't shut it off immediately) burn out.

    Write protecting 3.5 inchers. (disks) Very simple.  All you need
is a pocket knife or a push pin.  Pry up on the corner of the disk
with the write protect tab till you hear a snap.  Then, with the knife
or whatever, push out the write protect tab.  Finally if the edge of
the disk is still seperated, squeeze it untill it snaps togeather
again. Viola!  Write protected disk.  However, if you want to be able
to write to it again, place a small strip of tape (even scotch tape)
across the back of the write protect hole and write to your heart's
content.  I know this works for the mac.

Subject: Virus Protection and Universities

I would like to know what other universities are doing about buying
virus protection packages. We have a copy of Virex for our use but
would like to implement something in the labs. We have look at SCAN
but McAfee shareware site licences prices are exceptionally high.  The
minimum purchase is for use on 100 machines for $3250. We would
probably be better off buying just a few copies and putting them on
machines set aside for virus checking only.

Any thoughts from other university labs?

Not 100% correct - some scanners will scan some types of compressed
files simply by uncompressing them first - for example my F-PROT, and
(I think) McAfee's SCAN will scan a LZEXE-packed file.

Of course I want to make my scanner be able to scan all the different
types of compressed files - the problem is just that I don't have a
copy of all the compressors - in fact, I only have LZEXE and EXEPACK.
I know some of the compressors are available on SIMTEL20 and
elsewhere, but not all.  So, could somebody mail me information on the
status of the programs below - are they shareware/freeware/commercial,
and where are they available ?

No need to increase the traffic on Virus-L too much...I will post a

I know of one program from Bulgaria - perhaps Vesselin Bontchev could
provide some information on it - the problem is just that he does not
have a computer any more, as he was just promoted.

I know of no method to compress device drivers, which allows them to
be uncompressed dynamically on loading - it could be written, of
course, but I don't think it is worth the effort - device drivers are
usually so small (less than 50 Kbytes) one does not gain much in space
or loading time.

Subject: Using UUENCODE to send samples.

I often receive samples containing new viruses by E-mail, or programs
suspected of being viruses or Trojans.   To get the samples across, the
files are encoded into printable form, often by the UUENCODE program.

However, if the person sending the file is at a BITNET site, the UUencoded
file will arrive corrupted.  So, if you are sending binary files between
Internet and Bitnet machines and want to make sure they arrive OK - please
don't use UUencode - it is useless - use XXencode instead.

If anyone does not have xxencode.c or xxdecode.c, I will be happy to send out
copies of the programs.

	This method will detect the Stoned however "stealth" type
viruses (Brain, Joshi) will return the original boot sector
(floppy-Brain) or partition table (hard disk-Joshi) when an Int 13
request is processed since these viruses (as well as others) trap the
Int 13 call. A proven technigue is to first perform an Int 12 call
(returns # of k in hex to AX) and check for either 280h (640k) or 200h
(512k). Successful BSI/PTI viruses (Brain, Stoned, Joshi) go resident
at the TOM and change this value to some lower number.
