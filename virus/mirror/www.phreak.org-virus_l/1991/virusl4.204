CALL FOR PAPERS - Third USENIX UNIX Security Symposium

VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: question about viruses (UNIX) (PC)

Does anyone have a list over Unix virus?

I have the impression that most virus are infecting pc's and not Unix
machines. (To difficult?)

Does anyone know a product that are able to check UNIX and
look for virus and remove them if possible?

All comments are welcome

By "stealthy" I mean the usual things. That is, if the virus is active
in memory, reading an infected file results in a clean file being
read. Also, no changes in the file sizes can be observed.

I already explained in one of my previous messages, why this method is
not reliable in Bulgaria (no the Pravetz computers, more exactly).

Also not reliable, since as pointed out, sometimes both FAT copies are
markes as infected. Besides, the average user seldom is able to use NU
at all, otherwise I would propose to check for the 0(F)FFEh mark.

That's what my disinfector does. It kills the virus in the last
cluster only when all directory entries (including the ones that
belong to -deleted- EXE and COM files) are disinfected.

It's safer to check the directories, instead of the files, because of
the fact that the virus infects directory entries that belong to
deleted executables as well. The only advantage to the file search is
that it allows you to find files that really contain the virus,
without their directory entries being infected. IMHO, the best
solution is to combine both approaches in a disinfector, which looks
for several viruses. Then you can include three loops in it. The first
one scans the master boot sector for all master boot sector infectors,
the second scans the DOS boot sector for boot sector infectors, then
for each directory (1) scan the directory itself for infected entries
and (2) scan all files that are contained in the directory for
infection(s).

Correct, any self-respecting disinfecto should provide an option not
to disinfect, but only to report. This should be even the default mode
(it is -not- in my disinfector).

That's what I do. I kill it then.

Subject: Questions about VIRLIST.TXT (PC)

I am trying to plot some curves about viruses grown and, among other
sources, I use the file VIRLIST.TXT that cames with McAffe's package.
However, adding each virus individually (and their variants) doesn't
match the total supplied in the file. Here are the numbers I got:

Virlist version   Virlist total   Evaluated total

      66B             213           217
      67C             223           231
      71B             223           247
      72              241           251
      74B             475           469
      75              481           473
      76C             501           496
      77              505           500
      80              714           675
      82              893           898
      84              897           902

I assumed that each line of VIRLIST.TXT corresponds to an
unique virus and, if there is a number between parenthesis,
this number means the total number of known variants
(main strain plus mutations). Adding the viruses this way,
however, gives the discrepancies listed above. Can anybody
from McAffe Associates explain what I'm doing wrong?
Or how the list is to be interpreted?

Particularly interesting is the difference that occurs
with version 80 of VIRLIST.TXT. In the file the total is
714, but I got 675. The difference (39) is too big when
compared with those from the other versions (about 5).
Examining the list carefully I discover a great growing of
Whale variants (from 3 to 34). I wonder if this grown really
exists or was a typo when replacing the 3 with a 4 :-).
The number 34 for Whale remains the same in the next versions
of VIRLIST.TXT (82 and 84). There are really so many variants
for the Whale virus?

Other question is related with the scan I.D. Viruses with
the same I.D are the same virus or not? As an example, in
version 84 both Datacrime II and Datacrime II-B have the
same I.D. ([Crime-2]). Should they be added to the "unique
known viruses" or to the "known viruses variants"?

Another related question is about viruses that appear in two forms:
a "boot" and a "file" version. They are different viruses (with
no other relations than the name) or are the to be interpreted
as the same virus that is able to propagate using boot sectors
and files? If this last hypothesis is true, why the Horse Boot,
Invader and Virus-101 (all listed as able to infect boot sectors and
files) aren't listed in the same way?

Well, I wrote the .DOC file, does that count?

The Super PC Kwik disk caching program by Multisoft, Inc. should work
just fine with VSHIELD.  In earlier versions of the VSHIELD program, a
warning was given about using disk caching software in general.  Some
disk caching programs buffer writes to the disk as well as reads.  From
our POV, buffering disk writes is a Bad Idea(tm).  Here's why:  If a
computer was reset or turned off while there was something in the write
buffer, it's contents would be irrevocably lost. This could havee all sorts
of dangerous side effects, such as a file being left open, damage to the
root directory or FAT, or other unpredictable nasty results.  If you do
use disk caching software that has the option of buffering disk writes, I
would recommend that you turn that feature off or set it to 0.  Incidentally,
I did speak to someone over at Multisoft about this, and they said it
wasn't a problem with their program, then at V4.03.  I would assume that
they either don't buffer disk writes and/or trap reboots and flush the
cache to disk before allowing the reboot sequence to proceed.  Of course,
the latter still wont protect you against a hardware reset or power off,
but it's better then nothing :-)

VSHIELD V84 with the /LH switch requires a (approximately) 31Kb UMB.  So
about a third of the original size.  The actual ~110Kb requirement was
for VSHIELD to initialize its code prior to going resident, it would
then "shrink back" to it's 30-whatever Kb size.

[SHRUG] I would think that a device driver would provide very little
additional security, if any, compared to a TSR.  I have not come across
any virus that "ran circles" around our TSR-based program, I do think
that VSHIELD did intercept all the viruses in their test suite, though.

Subject: "Precidence" (PC)

The "precidence" of execution is a function of the Command Line
Interpreter (CLI) or Shell, not of MS-DOS. In DOS 5.0 COMMAND.COM
(47845 bytes dated 03-22-91) this is found at offset A956h and
consists of the string ".COM .EXE.BAT". Alteration of the string &
spawning a new CLI can have "interesting" results though the form of
the new file must match that of the old. e.g.  If the string is
changed to ".CCC.EXE.BAT" files with extension .COM will no longer
execute however those with .CCC will *so long as they follow .COM file
standards*.

A more complex modification would be required to redirect the mode of
the file so that it is possible to change the precidence to anything
you might while maintaining the current file extension(s) or changing
them. The question is whether it is worth the effort.

Incidently, while on the subject of "companion viruses" (more
accurately "spoofs"), a good integrity checker that maintains a list
of all files on a drive such as McAfee's VSHIELD /CERTIFY,
Enigma-Logic's Virus-Safe, or Certus's Novi (I forget the switches but
nothing at the Brickyard ever sounded like that supercharged 8) would
notify the user that a program not in the database had been requested
for execution and ask the user if they *really* wanted to execute it.

Everybody is using this kind of protection aren't you ? I have for
over a year now (one layer).
