VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: Administrivia - getting ready for Volume 5

As I indicated previously, I'm soliciting for suggestions for
improving VIRUS-L/comp.virus so that we can get 1992 (and Volume 5 of
the digests) off to a good start.  So far, I've gotten two real good
selections, which I'll be implementing.  The first is effective
immediately, and the second will get started with Volume 5.

- - Re-organize the product reviews into separate "pc" and "mac"
  directories.  Effective immediately, all PC product reviews are
  archived on cert.sei.cmu.edu (192.88.209.5) in:

    pub/virus-l/docs/reviews/pc

  ...and all Macintosh reviews are in:

    pub/virus-l/docs/reviews/mac

  (Reviewers - I have a bit of a backlog of reviews that I'll be
  posting over the next week or two.  I haven't forgotten about it.)

- - Change the numbering scheme of the archived issues.  Up until, and
  including all of Volume 4 (the current volume), the filenames for
  the digests themselves have been "v#i#" (e.g., v4i1, v4i11, v4i222).
  Starting with Volume 5, I'll be numbering them as "v#i###" (e.g.,
  v5i001).  This will make it easier to read alphabetized directory
  listings.  (Pray - and not just for this reason - that we never
  reach v#i1000... :-)

Thanks to everyone who has taken the time to jot me a note.  Keep 'em
coming.

Subject: Re: possible virus? (PC)

It sounds like your problem with the Epsons is a hardware one rather
than a virus.  Those machines are rather old and I know the wear and
tear the computing lab enviroment causes.  (I'm labs manager here at
the UC-GSB)

You didn't mention it, but does the machine boot and ask you to hit
<F1>?  Often times when the battery that backs up the CMOS memory
starts to go that is the first symptom.  The solution is to get a new
battery pack.

What kind of drives are in the Epsons?  The 3-1/5-inch in 5-1/2-inch
frame 20M drives that were in a lot of them (Tandons I seem to recall)
tended to fail.  As the machines all tend to get the same number of
hours use in a lab, failures tend to cluster in time.  (We have HP EGA
monitors that all started dying the same time) If its the drive,
consider replacing the HD, HD controller and Floppy controller with an
IDE drive and controller.  We did that will all of our HP Vectras and
breathed new life into obsolete hardware (also get DOS 5 at the same
time, makes the machines noticably faster to the users.)  You chould
be able to get a 40M drive and controller for about 250.00 (if you
can't get it locally I can give you the name and phone number of the
Chinese Bookstore that we buy our computer parts from.)

This is very short question: What is MDISK, which is mentioned in
McAfee documentation in some Virus infected cases?

Is it like FDISK, which will 'clear' boot-sectors, FAT etc. and
build them without new installation of operating system?

Just wondering.

Subject: Dir II in Norway (PC)

 Vesselin Bontchev writes in his VALERT message of DEC 05 that the "Dir
 II" virus has 6% "of the Norwegian infections".  Happy I am to say that
 this is not so.  He has misunderstood the graphs he got from me in
 Washington DC last week at the Anti Virus Prod. Developers Conference.

 Vesselin has encuraged me to explain the facts of the matter:

 A Norwegian compagny with offices in Sofia "imported" the virus to
 Norway.  12 machines at one site was infected.  The incident was
 reported to us on 14NOV91 at wich time we confirmed the virus to be "Dir
 II".  It seems that we have been successful in stopping the virus this
 time, no other incidents have been reported so far (I guess it is just
 a matter of time...).

Subject: PC problem - possible virus? (PC)

     As a 'sometimes' DOS support person within my organization, I was
asked to take a look at one of the user's PCs Monday morning.  This
particular machine was one of a series of 31 that were recently
acquired by the Laboratory.  A description of the machine, and the
problems I encountered, along with a listing of what I attempted to do
follows.  I do not know the cause of the problems, but the user stated
that the machine was functioning properly on Saturday, was shut down
and not turned on again until Monday morning.  Is it possible that a
virus, not detected by vscan82, caused this condition, or are you
aware of anything else that could cause such a complete scrambling of
a hard drive?

          device=c:\windows\smartdrv.sys 2048 512
          FILES=20

Description of Problem:

The system was used on Saturday, 30 November 1991, and no problems
were noticed.  System refused to boot on Monday morning, 2 December
1991.  The error message was a non-system disk message.  A check of
the CMOS setup showed that the hardware configuration information
pertaining to the drives, both floppy and hard, was missing.  The CMOS
showed no floppy or hard drives installed.  The clock and the RAM
sizes were correct, however.
     The setup information was replaced, and an attempt was made to
re-boot the system.  The same error message appeared.  A check of the
setup showed the proper information, but the machine would not boot
from the hard drive.
     The computer was booted from a floppy disk, and vscan82 was run
on drive c:, with the result of 'No viruses found'.  I attempted to
use the DOS sys command, and the error message 'Not enough room to
install system' was returned.  I next tried the DOS 'chkdsk c:'
command, and the error messages scrolled off the screen continuously,
until I grew weary and did a Ctrl break to stop it.  While the drive
test was running, the list of files being tested filled the screen to
overflowing, then continued to scroll off the screen.  The screen was
filled with lines similar to the following:

C:\DOS\DOS\DOS\DOS\DOS\DOS\DOS\DOS\DOS\DOS\DOS\DOS\DOS\DOS\DOS\Windows\****
****.*** (*******.*** represents various files), error message.
C:\DOS\DOS\DOS\DOS\DOS\DOS\DOS\DOS\DOS\DOS\DOS\DOS\DOS\DOS\DOS\Windows\****
****.***, error message.

     My next step was an attempt to use Norton Utilities' Norton Disk
Doctor (NDD) in an attempt to resolve the problem.  Version 4.5 was
the version of Norton's which was used.  NDD found the following
errors, which I indicated it should 'fix':
     1. Media descriptor byte error
     2. Error in partition table
     3. Error in FAT tables
     4. File size allocation error
     5. Cross-linked files
After supposedly fixing these problems, NDD asked if I wished to test
all of the drive surface for defects, and I answered yes.  After
completion of the NDD program, an attempt was made to boot the machine
from the hard drive.  The original error message was again displayed.
     A second attempt was made to run NDD, but the following message
was displayed:
     'Drive identifier type error.  Return to setup and correct the
drive identifier for the hard drive then attempt to execute NDD.'  A
check was made of the CMOS, and the correct drive type identifier was
displayed:

                     Cyln   Head   WPcom     LZone    Sect     Size
     47 = USER TYPE   874    16     875       875      17      116MB

  Another attempt was made to run NDD, but the invalid drive type
identifier message was again displayed.
     Vscan was again run, with no viruses found.
     I tried to execute the dos 'tree' command and pipe the results to
a file, but the PC simply 'locked up' and had to be rebooted from the
floppy drive.  I tried this twice before giving up on it.
     I acquired a copy of XTree Gold and used it to log onto drive C:.
Xtree Gold told me that there was 220Mb of files on drive C: with 112
Mb of free space available, and the tree structure looked exactly as
expected after seeing the multiple \DOS subdirectories.  The \DOS
branches of the tree extended all the way across the screen, and at
the bottom of each branch were the MCAFEE, KERMIT, UTILS, and WINDOWS
subdirectories, each with copies of the files from the original
directories.
     I attempted to 'PRUNE' the erroneous \DOS subdirectory branches,
but received an error message that the directories were not empty.  A
further check revealed that each copy of the branch had a directory
with files with read-only and hidden attributes set.  I went to the
second from the left branch and manually, using Xtree Gold, changed
the file attributes, erased the files, and deleted the directories
under the \DOS directory.  When I tried to move to another branch, the
message 'Drive has been changed' was received.  I quit Xtree Gold,
then immediately restarted it.  All of the \DOS sub-directories were
still there, but no other sub-directories, or files, showed up.
However, the drive window still showed 220 Mb of files and 112 Mb of
space available.  I exited Xtree Gold and attempted to do a 'dir c:',
and the system locked up.  I rebooted from a floppy, then executed the
dos command fdisk.  I deleted the drive partition table, then
re-partitioned the drive (one large, bootable, dos partition), then
re-formatted the drive as a system drive.  After re-installing the
dos, windows, mcafee, and some utility files and re-creating the
autoexec.bat and config.sys files, the system booted from the hard
drive with no problems.  Vscan82 was again run, with no virus found.

be greatly appreciated.  You may reach me at the following address:

SCAN.EXE	02B9		0486
VSHIELD		57AA		0E66


Can this be officially confirmed by McAfee Associates?

It was mentioned that a frequently-asked-questions list be maintained
in this news group.  This list should include a standard check summing
method of validating the latest anti-virus programs.  Whether McAfee's
validate methods or a RSA method, there should be a way to confirm the
integrity of these critical programs.

One of the generally available computers in the Chemistry Department
here at the University of Washington was recently infected with the
Voronezh virus.

To date I have not encountered any information on this virus.  In
order to best handle the infection here in the department, as well as
helping to stem the spread on this capmus, I need some more
information about this virus.

I would appreciate it if someone could provide me with information on
this virus, similar to that in a recent post on the Michalangelo
virus, Message-ID: <0015.9112041458.AA14139@ubu.cert.sie.cmu.edu>,
(which I also had the pleasure of having to disinfect this week :-(

DEFMTH1.CVP   911206

                     Viral Myths - Malice

The old saw "it ain't that folks is so ignorant, it's that they
know so much that ain't so" is true in the computer virus field
as in no other I have ever been involved with.  For a variety of
reasons, hard facts about computer viral programs are extremely
hard to come by, while rumours, innuendo and outright lies
abound.

The terms "virus" and "damage" are so closely connected in the
minds of most computer users that "virus" is now being used to
describe any situation in which a computer is damaged,
unavailable or simply not doing what the user wants.  (This
leads to the "Hurricane Hugo Virus", the "I-hit-Exit-and-the-
word-processor-stopped Virus" and, the favourite of all
technical support people, the "Not-Plugged-In Virus".)  By the
same token, many users fear *any* viral program, regarding all
of them as if they carried the Black Death.

The truth is, relatively few viri perform any overt "damage" to
a system.  Of the hundreds of viral strains, only a small number
carry a "payload" intended to corrupt data or erase random
files, and these tend to be correspondingly rare in terms of
number of infections.  Those few viral variants which "destroy"
their target files or disks are, by definition, self revealing
and self limiting.

(Of course, I now have to back pedal by defining "overt" damage.
All viral programs make some kind of change to the system.  Even
those which are designed to be "benign" may cause unforseen
problems in new situations.  It is quite certain that the author
of the "Stoned" virus did not intend any kind of damage to
result from its spread; he just never knew anything about RLL
disk controllers or high density disks.  Most "header" or
"integrity" checks in programs were intended only to trap bad
copies or disk sectors; they still stop programs from operating
if a viral infection occurs.  In these days of increasingly
multi-layered operating systems and "background" utility
programs, the addition of a resident virus is increasingly
likely to result in unforseen interactions.

It is also important to note that all viri, trojans and
hacking/breaking erode, and may ultimately destroy, the trust
and community which currently supports so much international
research and cooperation on the nets.)

If viral programs are not intended to cause damage, why are they
written?  My personal opinion is that this is a kind of
self-reproducing electronic graffiti.  Basically, it is an
unsightly nuisance, perpetrated by tiny minds in search of some
place in life.  Most of them don't think they are harming
anyone.  Most of them don't think.

NEW RELEASE OF McAFEE ASSOCIATES SOFTWARE

Version 85 of the VIRUSCAN, VSHIELD, CLEAN-UP and NETSCAN programs has
been released.
     Seventy-six viruses have been added.  Viruses that have
been reported at multiple sites include the Barcelona virus in Spain,
the Haifa virus in Israel, the Hary and Irish viruses in the U.K., the
New 1701 virus in Finland and Norway, the SBC, Stoned III, and SVC 5.0
viruses in North America.  Other viruses added in this release are the
123, 233, 370-B, 408, 487, 621, 640, 658, 709, 712, 737, 7th Son, 802,
812, 1193, 1241, 1463, 1530, Ada, Argentina, ASC, Brothers, Cara, Caz,

Grape, H-2, Hero-b, Invol, Joke, Karin, Kiev-1, KU-448, LC, Mono, MPS-11,
MSTU, Parasite, PathHunt, Pirate, Plov, Poem, Pregnant, QML, Reset, SCT,
Sentex, Socha, Suriv 4.02, Squeeker, Stink, Sys, SX, Tony, Travel, V82,
V-5, VTS, and Word-1 viruses.
     Version 85 of VIRUSCAN adds several new options as well as
enhancing existing ones:  The ability to NOT add validation codes to
files with the /AV option by creating an exception list of files to
ignore, the option of beeping whenever a virus is found with the /BELL
switch, the option of displaying messages in Spanish with the /SP switch,
the ability to search a system for files that do not have validation codes
with the /CERTIFY switch, the option to speed up VIRUSCAN's output with the
/FAST switch, the option to skip scanning inside of PKLITE-compressed files
with the /NPKL switch, the abilty to display a help screen by typing /?, /H,
or /HELP, and the ability of storing the options to run VIRUSCAN in a
configuration file.
     CLEAN-UP version 85 adds the ability to display messages in
Spanish when run with the /SP switch
     Disinfectors have been added for the 903, 1008, 1024, 1253, 1554,
V2000, 2560, 3445, Boys, Cara, Devil's Dance, Enigma, Flash, Greemlin,
Irish, M128, Possessed, SBC, SVC 5.0, SVC 6.0, and V730 viruses.
     Clean-Up also now removes generic boot sector viruses and generic
partition table viruses.
     Version 85 of VSHIELD adds one new option as well as a new
supplemental program.  When VSHIELD is run with the /NOBREAK option,
it can not be broken out of during installation with a Ctrl-C or
Ctrl-Break key combination.  The CHKSHLD program can check to see
if VSHIELD is loaded in memory.  This is primarly for for network
administrators who want to prevent network access to uses who are not
running VSHIELD.   Compatibility with Quarterdeck's QEMM memory
management software has been improved as well.
     V85 also now checks the B: drive for boot viruses if the /COPY
option is used.
