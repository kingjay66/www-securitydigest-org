VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,

For those of you with IDE hard drives, contact Seagate.  They are
selling Disk Manager (version 4.1 or later is needed) for $6.00.  This
version of Disk Manager will format the boot sector, partition table,
and the data sections of the disk, but not the error table.  You might
want to ask Seagate and your vendors for details.

I am not endorsing Disk Manager, but merely reporting what Mr. Ebdon has
reported as what worked for him.

Thanks, Derek, for the reminder.  I hope your machine is working much
better now.  ;-)

This is certainly a vialble alternative. However, if running DOS 4.0
or later, CHKDSK will "normally" detect this and return "655360"
anyway.

A few years ago, when we received or first Compaq 386-20e in we
discovered the same thing: 1k missing from the TOM & DEBUG revealed it
to be essentially zero-filled (obviously not executable). After much
prodding, Compaq told us that it was a buffer area for the mouse
driver and that there is a jumper on the motherboard that can be moved
to restore the missing 1k.

Whenever a new machine comes in, it is a good idea to take some
baseline data for later reference.

For me, any time Int 12 is lowered, I check the memory area in
question.  If executable code is found, unless known, a look is taken
at other system integrity areas for a reason. If nulled or obviously
data, the manufacturer is called for an explination (often a
frustating & time consuming experience).

Subject: DOS 5 Fdisk (PC)

Readers might want to play with an undocumented /MBR switch in DOS 5
FDISK.  It appears to force FDISK to overwrite the code in a PC/PS2
master boot record, without touching the partition table, and in
limited testing on a half dozen machines it succeeded in cleaning up
machines infected with the Stoned, the Stoned 2, and the Joshi
viruses.  This was with the DOS 5 shipped by IBM, not Microsoft's DOS
5; can somebody please test MS-DOS 5?

The Joshi can't be removed this way unless it isn't active in memory.
(e.g. cold boot from a write protected, uninfected bootable DOS 5 disk
with a copy of FDISK on it.)

The command line syntax tested was
   FDISK /MBR

According to the release notes, you can catch the parameters of a Set in HC 2.1

Unfortunately if the virus stack traps for the OpenStack Message it becomes

in a system through BBS procedures (e.g., new user information,
uploading zip files).  We *ARE NOT* looking for viruses that are

Subject: Possible PC Virus (PC)

I have a Packard Bell with an 80386X-16 Mhz CPU. It runs on MS-DOS
4.01 and a Dosshell 4.0. Everytime I do work on the computer (word
processing, networking, games, etc.) DOS seems to create (on its own)
a file, named numerically or alpha-numerically but in a random
fashion, of about 15K in size (with a range of from 7K to 17K). When
you try to view the file (which incidentally sits among the DOS
files), you can make out that it is bits and pieces of what is on the
hard drive. Initially, it has not affected any other program on the
hard drive. However, two days ago, the DOS files appeared to have
replicated themselves with such names as EDLIN._OM and AUTOEXEC._AT,
all of which were 77 bytes in size with the same dates and times. This
necessitated reformatting the hard drive. Also, the Dosshell was
removed from the AUTOEXEC.BAT. Right now, the problem seems to have
been corrected, whatever it was. Is anybody familiar with this
problem? Most other resource people I I have consulted about this have
indicated that they have only heard about this on Packard Bell
computers. Any tips?

Since no real virus was present all of these "hits" could be regarded
as false alarms, theoretically. We must be careful to distinguish what
is being tested here. Just because a particular anti-viral product
does not declare a particular test string to be a virus, we cannot say
that the scanner has failed. A good case can be made for saying that
the simulator failed.

The only "test target" that can be used is the entirety of a virus,
and at that point you no longer have a "simulator", you have the real
thing.

Norton Antivirus 1.0.0 gets both Yankee Doodle (various forms) and
Frodo (4096). You can install as RAM-resident program to check
incoming files. It works.

I have been reviewing a product from Bangkok called Victor Charlie
that takes a similar approach.  An intriguing concept.

I hope to be able to release the review shortly.

It is small because it is written in assembly, with no configuration
options.  It tries to prevent virus infection from being successful,
and issue an informative message via the notification manager.  The
means used to block infection vary according to the virus.  Like
Disinfectant it is effective against a list of known viruses, and
tries to be specific enough to avoid false alarms.

It does not scan files on every inserted disk for say, nVIR.

We are currently advocating that general users at Northwestern use
only the Disinfectant INIT and not Vaccine or Gatekeeper Aid, and that
they get periodic updates.

The risk from unknown viruses seems balanced by the reduced grief to
general users.  The rate of virus spread is slow enough that this is
workable.

Vaccine presents unclear messages, bombs on application startup under
many real infections and is bypassed by other newer viruses and has a
few minor bugs unrelated to viruses.

Gatekeeper Aid has occasionally removed the CODE resources from my
running applications.  Like the other Gatekeeper tools, I think it is
useful for advanced users, but too paranoid and subject to false
alarms for average Mac users.  There is a tradeoff between detecting
suspicious activity and being quiet and specific. (See discussion in
the Disinfectant online help.)

I would not recommend "KillVirus" - it seems to be one of many early
nVIR tools, that are not as generally effective as the Disinfectant
INIT. I know nothing about "Kill WDEF - virus INIT", but it is not
needed if you use the Disinfectant INIT.

I think that these can co-exist, but I don't remember which takes priority.

Subject: Getting register contents, etc. "on the fly." (PC)

If you want to find out what's in memory at a particular location, and
you're lucky enough to be using a Zenith computer (at least, on every
Zenith I've seen except the Eazy-PC -- it had a non-Zenith BIOS), you
can press ctrl-alt-return (enter, whatever), at pretty much any time,
and be thrown into what Zenith calls a "monitor program" -- the same
one you get when you press ctrl-alt-ins.  Only in this state, it shows
you the memory contents at the current location.  You can change,
examine, etc. from this point.  If you type "g" and press return,
you'll go back to executing the program where you left off, assuming
you didn't mess with anything important.  It's essentially a built-in
debugger.

Apologies to anyone who doesn't have a Zenith, but look on the bright
side, this feature can cause incompatability problems on rare
occasions.

Well, this is of course not correct - a format is never necessary to
get rid of a virus - boot sector or otherwise.  However, Azusa is
rather problematic, as it does not store the original PBR anywhere -
it simply replaces it.  (It is easy to remove Azusa from diskettes)

Suggested solutions:  1) Use NU to zero out the PBR, then use
			 NDD to rebuild it.

		      2) Use a disinfection program which can replace
			 the PBR with a "standard" PBR - such programs
			 exist.

Well, not always - I have a HP/Vectra, where the BIOS reserves a 4K
area just below the 640K mark.  However, INT 15H, AH=C1H is not
implemented in the BIOS (I know - I traced through it), and INT 15H,
AH=C0H will return the information that no Extended BIOS area is used.

A friend of my got viruses.  I use scan v77 to check it found the

C:\DOS\KILL\VIRUS.EXE was infected by jerusalem.  I also use Virx 1.14
to check the C drive, the only hard drive she has, and find stoned-b.
But I could not find the file VIRUS.EXE exist. The kill subdir only
has four files and neither is VIRUS.EXE. Does any one know what

But the Clean did doing very well when cleaned those viruses.  I
cleaned the hard disk before I thinking about this question!
