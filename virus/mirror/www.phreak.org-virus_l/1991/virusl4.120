Subject: Input sought on security course
     
  I am preparing to write a paper for a graduate computer secrity
course, and would appreciate input on the following:
  I will be comparing the effects (not structure or design) of compter
virses and biological viruses.  I have seen in the literature
references to how computer viruses spread at a (typically) exponential
rate.  This is without any numbers to back it up.  Viruses affecting
people have various distributions, eg. exponential, uniform, etc...
If anyone has information on this, or can describe an accurate
accounting of where, when, and how many machines were hit and how an
attack ran over time of a computer virus, I would find it most
helpful.  Part of my paper will regard factors which affect the rate
of spread of viral programs.
  If you know of any journal with a well-documented case, or similiar
articles, I would find that helpful.  Also, a while back, I believe
Computers & Security ran an issue which included information on the
mathematical modeling of viruses or at least certain aspects.  Did
anybody (or any of you) read it?
     
Thank you

Subject: Problem with GUARD (PC)
     
   I received GUARD from Y. Radai today.  I think I found a
significant problem with it.  On rebooting from the hard drive, after
an infection by "stoned", Guard removes stoned from the PBR but not
from memory.  The Int 13 vector is still routed through stoned.
FPROT's "f-mmap" shows a 2k block of memory taken from the top of
memory.  Debug shows this to be the stoned virus.  If this area is
overwritten, the system will crash on the next disk read or write.  If
instead a floppy disk is formatted, chances are it will be infected
with the stoned virus.  On the next bootup from the C drive, the virus
is gone from memory.  I haven't tried this behavior yet with other
viruses.
     
The experiment:
1. Install "guard", as described in the documentation.
2. Reboot the computer from a "stoned" floppy.  (Cold or warm reboot:
doesn't matter.)
3. Reboot the computer from the Hard Drive.  (Cold or warm boot, doesn't
matter.)
4. CHKDSK will show 2k missing from total memory.
5. On a 640K computer, the DEBUG command "d9f80:0000 1ff" will show the
virus at TOM.
6. At this point I formatted a 360k floppy.  It became infected.
7. Using debug to overwrite the virus area at 9f80:0000-1ff caused a
system crash on the next disk read or write.
8. Reboot from C:.  The virus is no longer in memory.  (This is because
it is no longer in the PBR.
     
Comments:
In my opinion, "Guard" doesn't give us anything that is not already in
Padgett's DiskSecure package.
     
When it is infected by a stealth virus (at least by the Empire family
of viruses) guard does not permit the computer to be rebooted from the
hard drive, and automatically remove the virus from the hard disk. (I
had expected, from the promises Mr. Radai has been making.)  One must
boot from a clean floppy and run guard from the floppy to clean the
hard drive.  I think Padgett has been right all along: you cannot keep
an MBR from being infected by a cold boot from a floppy, using
software alone.  The best you can do is immediately recognize the
infection, on rebooting from the hard drive, and then manually clean
the system after re-booting from a floppy.
     
Even without the error described above, Guard gives less protection
than DiskSecure. Guard does not itself use stealth to protect the MBR
from reads or writes.

Well - keep in mind that this program has now been repackaged as the
'Central Point Anti-Virus'.  I don't know the terms of the contract,
of course, but I would not be too surprised if Turbo Anti-Virus would
be discontinued soon.
     
Of course, this is pure speculation form a not-entirely-unbiased
source, so don't take me too seriously ..... :-)

It works - 95% of the time.
     
It is unable to catch two groups of viruses - overwriting/destuctive
viruses such as Burger, and sophisticated "stealth" viruses such as
Frodo.
     
Overwriting viruses are not a problem - but detecting infection by
stealth viruses when they are active is more difficult - although not
impossible.

NO - NO - NO
     
This is not correct.  Even if a 'Stoned' signature is found in memory
after you do a 'DIR' on an infected diskette, it does not mean that
the virus is installed or active.
     
The reason is very simple - when you do a DIR, DOS may read the boot
sector, as it contains information on the structure of the diskette.
The boot sector is simply found in one of the disk buffers - it is not
executed or active in any way.
     
Therefore - no problem.

Hi folks,
     
Does anyone know where I can get software reviews, published or not,
of f-prot, McAfee's viruscan or IBM's virscan? The July issue of PC
WORLD doesn't mention any of these and I'm required to provide some
sort of "official" comparison documentation before purchasing
anything.
     
Thanks for any help you can provide.
     
[Ed. There are two sets of independent reviews (one by Rob Slade and
the other by Chris McDonald) available by anonymous FTP on

NO NO NO!! Doing a DIR on an infected floppy cannot and will not cause
the Stoned virus to either infect the hard disk NOR go memory
resident.  The only way for the Stoned virus to go memory resident is
to boot off an infected floppy - even if it is a 'non-bootable'
floppy(All formatted floppies have a valid boot sector - a bootable
floppy also has the two hidden system files and command.com).
     
Once this has happened then the Stoned virus has gone resident and has
also infected the partition table on the hard disk. Any subsequent
boots off the hard disk will send Stoned memory resident - after all
the hard disk is now infected.
     
Note that the stoned virus can be classed as a stealth virus as it
hides itself - it was released before the 'stealth' definition was
invented.
     
Once Stoned is memory resident accesses of subsequent uninfected
floppies will cause the Stoned virus to infect the subject floppies -
I believe a DIR command will do this. NB!!!! The virus must already be
memory resident and the infection goes to the floppy - not the other
way!!.
     
Your situation sound as if your hard disk is already infected.  The
ONLY safe way to confirm this and to remove the Stoned virus is to
boot off a CLEAN and write protected floppy and THEN run the
anti-viral software to detect and remove the virus.
     
To be specific the Stoned virus infects your hard disk the moment the
boot sequence access the boot sector of an infected floppy. This
happens very early and before the systems files are loaded.  Suffice
to say that if you boot with an infected floppy in Drive A: then as
soon as the boot sequence accesses the floppy, the drive light comes
on, then its too late - you've been zapped.  Once on an hard disk it
resides in the partition table. The partition table, along with
storing the hard disk partition info, also has executable code that
hands control of the boot to the hard disk boot sector. It is the
partition table executable code that the Stoned virus invades.

Subject: Re: Stoned virus and DIR command (PC)
     
OOPS.  In my reply to Mike Ramey concerning putting Stoned into memory
merely by doing DIR, I listed several simple tests.  One of them was:
>      SCAN C: /M
>           "No viruses found."
>      DISKCOPY A: B:
>      SCAN C: /M
>           "Found Stoned Related Virus [Stoned] active in memory."
     
Well, here's my mistake.  Some time before writing the reply I had
actually done this sequence, getting the above results.  HOWEVER, I
had run DISKCOPY from within another program, then ran SCAN after
exiting the program.  As a result, SCAN did not overwrite the copy of
Stoned in memory.  If DISKCOPY and SCAN are run back-to-back, SCAN
will overwrite part of DISKCOPY's data space, producing these results:
     
     SCAN C: /M
          "No viruses found."
     DISKCOPY A: B:
     SCAN C: /M
          "No viruses found."
     
Just for consistency's sake, I retried the DIR and NU tests both from
the DOS prompt and from within a program.  All results were as written
before.
     
No doubt there are several comments about this mistake already on
their way as I write this.  I'm just letting those who caught it know
that I'm aware of it, and those who did not catch it understand it.

I want to thank everyone who sent me advice and ideas.  Padgett
Patersen and Fridrik Skulson gave the best advice. It turned out that
I had two problems, both of which were identified correctly by
Fridrik.  A few data files were infected by the virus, and the virus
was hidden in a LZE compressed file /files.  The compressed files were
part of a commercial anti virus package popular in Israel.
     
The first is supposed to immunize the computer and is a TSR, the
second scans a nd cleans.  When the program detects a TSR virus it can
de-activate it and proceed to clean the disk.  Would would happen, I
think, is the program would load, run the virus, and immediately
deactivate it. The signature probably remained in memory, and was
subsequently detected by other scanners.
     
When the TSR protecting program was run, it simply activated the virus.
     
Thanks again every one.

DEFGEN2.CVP   910707
                       What and What Not
Having established that viral programs copy themselves, and
before going on to related types of programs, let me list a few
things that viri are *not*.
     
Let me first say that computer viral programs are not a
"natural" occurence.  These are programs which are written by
programmers.  They did not just appear through some kind of
electronic evolution.  Viral programs are written, deliberately,
by people.  (Having studied the beasts almost from their
inception, I was rather startled when a young, intelligent, well
educated executive proposed to me that viri had somehow "just
grown" like their biological counterparts.)
     
The popular press has recently started to publicize the term
computer virus, but without giving any details other than the
fact that viri are to be feared.  (Often the reports talk about
"main storage destroyed" and other such phrases which have very
little meaning.)  This has given most people the impression that
anything that goes wrong with a computer is a virus.  From
hardware failures to errors in use, everything is blamed on a
virus.  *A VIRUS IS NOT JUST ANY DAMAGING CONDITION.*
     
Likewise, it is now considered that any program that may do
damage to your data or your access to computing resources is a
virus.  We will speak further about trojan horse programs, logic
bombs and worms, but it is important to note that viral programs
have common characteristics that other damaging or security
breaking programs may lack.  Viri are not just any damaging
program.
     
Indeed, viral programs are not always damaging, at least not in
the sense of being deliberately designed to erase data or
disrupt operations.  Most viral programs seem to have designed
to be a kind of electronic graffiti: intended to make the
writer's mark in the world, if not his or her name.  In some
cases a name is displayed, on occasion an address, phone number,
company name or political party (and in one case, a ham radio
license number.)
     
On the other hand, viral programs cannot be considered a joke.
Often they may have been written as a prank, but even those
which have been written so as not to do any damage have had
bugs, in common with any poorly written program.  The author of
Stoned abviously knew nothing of high density floppies or RLL
drive specifications.  In fact, it appears that the trashing of
data by the Ogre/Disk Killer virus, one of the most damaging,
was originally intended to be reversible, were it not for an
error on the part of the programmer.  Any program which makes
changes to the computer system that are unknown to the operator
can cause trouble, the more so when they are designed to keep
spreading those changes to more and more systems.
     
However, it is going to far to say, as some have, that the very
existence of viral programs, and the fact that both viral
strains and numbers of individual infections are growing, means
that computers are finished.  At the present time, the general
public is not well informed about the virus threat, and so more
copies of viri are being produced than are being destroyed.  As
people become aware of the danger, this will change.
