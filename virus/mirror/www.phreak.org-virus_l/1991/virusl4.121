VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

I recently installed DOS 5.0 on a 25 mhz 486. When I attempted to
install FPROT116 on the system, I got the exact same result you
describe above.

Subject: Stoned virus (PC)
     
Hello all you Virus Gurus.
     
The ever friendly Stoned Virus just hit our office and luckily (???)
there was only one casualty.  It seemed to wipe out the partition
table and both copies of the fat.  I used Norton to get back the
partition table but it seems to be choking a little getting the FAT's
back.
     
Any Ideas?  I really hate to let it wipe out files that it doesn't think
are repairable.
     
Oh yeah, did I forget to mention that this was my Boss's Computer?
     
Thanks for ANY help.  A post or e-mail are fine either way.

Subject: Re: Self scanning executables (PC)
     
A friend of mine solved the self-scanning problem, and his solution
(with TC and TP code) is in the public domain. A *true* CRC is
calculated.
     
Such a routine must solve a set of equations which predict what the
CRC will be after that same CRC is stored within the program itself.
Since the CRC is stored somewhere within, it is theoretically possible
for the self-check to be cracked. However, the current estimate of
time required for this is 3-4 hours on a 33-386 ... too long for such
action to escape your notice.
     
If there is interest in this item, let me know. I'll contact the
author and ask if he can make it available for FTP somewhere.

Does anyone on this list know of a public BBS that usually has the
most recent F-PROT? I will be closing my university Internet account
in a few weeks and would like to be able to access new versions as
they are released. Does Frisk offer a mail update service to

Does anyone have any feelings on what T.S.R. virus checker for the PC
gives the best protection whilst not using a vast amount of memory.
     
I work at the Universtiy of Manchester and on site there are about
4000 + computers and all will need some form of protection from the
students ( sorrey I ment viruses ) at this moment the little cherubs
are off on holiday ( peace, quiet, joy and bliss ).
     
My task is to place some form of protection on the computers before
the hoards get back and start to infect ( sorrey again I ment to say
use ) the computers and in doing so make my life a liveing hell.
     
The products that I have looked at so far are :-
Dr Solomons                Virus  Guard
Norton Anti-Virus          Virus  Intercept

HELLO EVERYBODY .....
     
I AM A NEW MEMBER IN YOUR GROUP.
     
        I want to discuss a new virus in my LAN ,i'm the lan adminstrator,
which is KEYPRESS. My LAN type is 10NET , the server is TANDY 4000,IBM compatib
e
   This virus symptoms is :
     1. Damaging the SCAN.EXE
     1. Damaging the SCAN.EXE & tthe CLEAN.EXE files
     2. Hanging some of the commands of LAN loading,specially those managing
        the connection with modem on an RS232 serial port.
     3. Hanging the commands of management of the Ram extensions, i use the
        386MAX commands.
     4. Finally , when scanning and cleaning from a write protect floppy
        it make horrible sounds trying to cut the protecion shields.
     
        Even when i succeed to remove them, they just come back again showing
     at the top right corner of the screen the word SAMSOFT.
     
        I have tried scan & clean with McAfee scan ver. 6.9V75.
     
I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW OF ANY NEW ANTI VIRUS PACKAGE AND ANY SUGGESTION FOR
PROTECTING THE LANS FROM VIRUSES.

As is stated in the GUARD.DOC file, "GUARD ... does not prevent infec-
tion of RAM or of diskettes."  It is designed to protect only the hard
disk.  For protection of diskettes and memory you have write-protect
tabs, generic monitoring programs, known-virus scanners, etc.
     
  Several people seem to be under the impression that GUARD is sup-
posed to be a panacea for virus problems, and are disappointed when
they find that it is not.  GUARD is intended to block a *specific
security hole*: that which occurs because ordinary anti-viral pro-
grams, such as those mentioned above, don't get a chance to activate
when booting is performed from a diskette.  GUARD is not designed as a
*substitute* for other programs, but as a *supplement* to them.
Please judge it in that light.
     
>In my opinion, "Guard" doesn't give us anything that is not already in
>Padgett's DiskSecure package.
     
Who ever said it does?  Actually, I haven't yet had the opportunity
to try DiskSecure (though I'm willing to bet that GUARD contains quite
a few features that DiskSecure doesn't).  I guess the most authorita-
tive answer on such a comparison will come from Padgett.

This is a serious claim, and will have to be investigated.  (That,
after all, is what testing is for.)  Thanks, Tim.

NO, NO, NO.  (That's getting to be a popular retort.  Two people used
the very same expression when correcting a statement by Mike Ramey!)
Take into account the following facts:
     
  1.  Webster's Third New International Dictionary gives the plural
form of the word explicitly; it's "viruses", not "viri" (and certainly
not "virii"!!).
  2.  Since our use of the word "virus" is by analogy with the micro-
biological use, try looking at a book in that area.  Again, you'll
find that the only plural used is "viruses".
  3.  As for the book you mention, take a closer look.  You might
find (as I found in another grammar book) that not all words ending
in "-us", even if they are of Latin origin, form their English plural
by replacing the "us" by "i" (as in Latin itself); many simply suffix
"es".  If you don't believe me, try using "boni", "circi", "chori",
"campi", or "cauci" in a sentence.
     
  Summary: "Viri" is fine if you're speaking Latin, but in English
it's "viruses".

From:    frisk@rhi.hi.is (Fridrik Skulason)
Subject: Self testing; New viruses; Beta testing; Translations (PC)
     
Several subjects...
     
Self-testing:
I wrote about a self-testing program yesterday - saying it was useless against
stealth-viruses and overwriting viruses, but as others have pointed out it is
even worse than that - a routine which only checks the program in memory is of
no use whatsoever.  There exist programs for adding self-test to most
programs, but they cannot detect infection by Frodo and a few other
sophisticated stealth viruses.  It is possible for a self-test program to
detect those viruses, but I know of no such program available now - they are
all on the drawing board.
     
New companion virus:
Until now the only known companion viruses were AIDS II and TPWORM.  Now
the third one has been discovered, and it is by far the most sophisticated
one.  It is a 351 byte COM virus, called Twin-351.  Unlike the other two
companion viruses it stays resident in memory, intercepting the
Findfirst/FindNext calls.  As the files containing the virus are also marked
as "hidden", the virus is able to hide quite efficiently, unless a program
reads the directory directly.  Has anyone heard of this virus outside Norway ?
     
Mule:
One of the more interesting variants of Jerusalem is the 'Slow' virus.  It was
first reported in Australia, but sources there say it may have arrived from
Thailand.  A related variant was discovered later in California, and named
Scott's Valley, after the place of discovery.  What makes these variants
interesting is the addition of encryption - apart from it they are
more-or-less standard variants of Jerusalem.  Recently a new encrypted variant
of Jerusalem was discovered in Australia.  My personal opinion is that the
viruses have a common auther, but this new one uses a different encryption
algorithm, and is not detected by the same pattern as the other two variants.
To detect it, the following pattern can be used
     
Mule        2E8A 262F 0E3E 3027 43E2 FA59 585B 1FC3
(or, for users of F-FCHK)
Mule        3+5m6kpjdmgjUlsuQbMSM-gEm7ZR7Wlgs+AFojmN5jwum94OmLjLjoAt5a5aMofWgN
     
The virus is 4112/4117 bytes long, and contains the text "My name is Mule"
     
Beta-testing?
I am sending out copies of version 2.0 of my program to anyone willing to do a
bit of testing - let me know if you are interested.
     
Cracker Jack:
There is a crackpot in Milan, Italy who is producing an incredible number of
viruses.  Most of the viruses are variants of Murphy, or some other viruses,
which are available in source code form.
     
He gives them names like "Exterminator", "Demon" and so on - expecting us to
distribute the viruses in the reasearch community, and make him "famous".
One of the viruses was not named according to his wishes - he called one of
them "Patricia", but in accordance with the rule that viruses should not be
named after virus researchers, (therefore the "Solomon" virus should be
known as Jerusalem-1600/1605), it was named "Smack", because of the following
text it contains:
     
        Special message to Patricia Hoffman: I love you!!!!!!!! SmackSmack!!
        Can you give me your telephone number??? Ciao bellissima!
     
He did not like this name change, as is evident from a text message in one of
the viruses in the next batch we got from him:
     
    Patricia does not function correctly, because I haven't run it before send.
    Now I'm debugging it
    ehehehehehahahahahahah
     
    Smack Virus....what a horrible name!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
     
    Compliments to the Dark Avenger for the nice viruses
    excuse me if I create some variants of your beautiful viruses
    Viruses are a nice thing!!
     
His viruses are available on one of the Italian virus BBSes, and probably
elsewhere as well, but they are (as far as I know) not known in the wild.
My question - he is probably going to continue creating viruses, but should
we play the game the way he wants - what I would like to propose is a name
change - just group all his viruses together and give them a name like
"Stupid Jack" or "Crackpot", followed by a number. We would then have
     
	Crackpot-272    (not "Demon")
	Crackpot-1951	(not "Goblin")
     
and so on for his 20 (or whatever) viruses.  Opinions ?
     
     
Translations:
I am having my anti-virus package translated into several different languages,
including Norwegian, Finnish, French, German, Italian and Spanish - in
addition to English and Icelandic.  Portugese and Turkish versions have
also been discussed.  If anybody is interested in the production of a version
for any other language, please contact me.
