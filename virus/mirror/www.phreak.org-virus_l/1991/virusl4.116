VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

                Towards a Definition of computer Viral Programs

The "man on the street" is now often aware of the term "computer
virus" even if he (or she) does not use a computer.  However, it is
often the case that those who are otherwise technically literate do
not understand some of the implications of the phrase.  This is not
surprising in that the term is slang, is often misused, and that
"hard" information is difficult to come by.

It is important to know what a computer virus is if you are going to
defend yourself against the many that are "out there."  It is also
important to know what a computer virus is not.  There are other types
of programs and situations which can do damage to your computer or
data, and many of these will not be caught by the same methods which
must trap viral programs.

A biological analogy, which we find in the dictionary, is helpful.
The Oxford English Dictionary, which speaks of:
    "... a moral or intelletual poison, or poisonous influence..."
while satisfying to the wounded ego of those who have been hit is not
terribly helpful in a technical sense.  Webster, however, steers us in
a more helpful route in stating that a virus is:
    "... dependent on the host's living cells for their growth and
reproduction..."

By elimating the biological references, we can come to the definition
that a virus is an entity which uses the resources of the host to
spread and reproduce itself without informed operator action.  Let me
stress here, the word "informed."  A virus cannot run completely on
its own.  The computer user must always take some action, even if it
is only to turn the computer on.  This is the major strength of a
virus: it uses *normal* computer operations to do its dirty work, and
therefore there is no single identifying code that can be used to find
a viral program.

I must make mention, before I continue, of the work of Fred Cohen.
Dr. Cohen is generally held to have coined the term "computer virus"
in his thesis, published in 1984.  However, his definition covers only
those sections of code which, when active, attach themselves to other
programs.  This, however, neglects many of the programs which have
been most successful "in the wild".  Many researchers still insist on
this definition, and therefore use other terms such as "worm" and
"bacterium" for those viri which do not attack programs.

<Blush> and thanks, but I think we could do better, frankly.  All
that, however, requires that users *actively* take part in the process
of product development.  If you're using a company's product and
there's stuff about it that you don't like, think is needed, want in
the next version --- call them up and tell them.  Microcom actually
pays people to listen to your suggestions (and the odd complaint, I
guess) and writes them up.  When we start talking about what to
include in the next version of the code, the end user (the people with
the money to buy the product) dictate what we stick into that next
release.  Be vocal!

This isn't just for anti-virus products, of course: I've been involved
in the commercial programming end of a number of products.  We always
work in an ideal world of what we think the world wants and
neds...until them pesky end-users start telling us where we're
wrong....

Heck, *I* was under the impression that everybody *loved* command line
interfaces (maybe my UNIX background showing through?) --- but it
seems people are in love with those hgorrid little drop and shadow
boxes.

Guess what Version 2.0 has in it....

Subject: New Release of VIRx: Version 1.6 now available (PC)

There were some problems with Version 1.5.  Version 1.6 is now
available on CIS, my BBS (212-889-6438) and, shortly, on SIMTEL-20.

Hightlights:
                   What's New In VIRx Version 1.6
                   ==============================

Date: 7/01/91

   1.   VIRx Version 1.6 now detects six newly discovered viruses,
   bringing the total count to just over 500.

   2.   VIRx now indicates whether an infected compressed program
   was infected before or after the compression (PKLITE and LZEXE).
   This was trivial to implement, but a useful addition.

   3.   Another few cycles were shaved off our decompression routines:
   experience pays.  For those wondering, all decompression routines
   are completely internal and done in memory --- and always have been.


Problems Corrected from v1.5:

   1.    False positives for the "Sathanyc/Goblin/Necrop" viruses.
   VIRx Version 1.5 was incorrectly identifying "ICE'ed" programs
   as infected.  An example of this was the well known TIMESET program:
   our apologies and gratitude to Peter Petrakis for being a good sport
   about our mistake.

   2.    Occasional false positives for "Scrnched" files: fixed.

   3.    The P1 Virus string was occasionally left in DOS buffers: another
   scanner program which apparently used the same string would make
   erroneous reports of an active P1 Virus in memory.  This has been fixed.

   4.     Due to similar templating of the V2P6 Virus, VIRx would find
   a possible infection in the VDEFEND program.  This was rectified.

This being the second time I have seen this type of posting with
regard to Frodo/4096 & have two comments to make: the 4096 is a
"stealth" virus & goes resident in memory. At least two of the scan
programs mentioned will detect the 4096 in memory unless they are
explicitly told not to (/nomem) in which case use will infect every
file on the disk (yes I did, publicly, once, nevermore)

However, this is one of the viruses that can be detected very easily
in memory using CHKDSK. Most clean 640k PCs will report "655360 bytes
total memory".  If the 4096 is resident, this value will be somewhere
below 652xxx bytes (CMA- do not have my notes here). If you have
655360 (everyone got it memorized now ?)  you do not have the 4096
"classic" version.

All,

I have seen many questions regarding the compatibility of Disinfectant
2.4 with Macintosh System 7 and the availability of Disinfectant 2.5.

I have experienced no problems using Disinfectant 2.4 with System 7,
though I understand the Disinfectant init should be left in the System
Folder proper - not placed in the Extensions folder.

The same is true of Disinfectant 2.5 and its init which is available
off Sumex-aim.stanford.edu via anonymous ftp now.

     This is definatly possible on Amiga's running Kickstart/Workbench
1.3 or lower.  All AmigaDos commands are executable files so a file
infector could easily use the dir or list commands.  I've heard that
Kickstart 2.0 has most AmigaDos commands in ROM (the ROMs are shipping
now) but I'm not sure.  That would be great from the virus
perspective...

     This is very much a terminological issue at two levels.  However,
I would agree with Vail that the definitions are sound and do not
require a modification of the statements that he made.  The real issue
is: "What is a program?"  I submit that the Master Boot Record of a PC
is a special-purpose program.  Therefore a Boot Sector Infector such
as Stoned is a virus using Vail's definition.  Any code executed in
the Desktop is a program, even if it is a Trojan horse program because
it is taking advantage of a weakness in System less than 7.0.
Therefore WDEF is a program infecting virus.  A program is any
stand-alone sequence of executable instructions, not just those
executed by a valid call to the operating system.  Slade has a good
question.  He is basically demanding clarification of terminology.  We
need that.  Stoned is a virus.  WDEF is a virus.  The Morris worm was
not a virus.  It was a worm.

Please, I have enough nightmares after my hard disk made that funny

non-standard and insufficiently well-tested format, thank you.

This has little to do with pascal, so I'm directing followups to
comp.virus.

p1@arkham.wimsey.bc.ca quotes from John Norstad:

>>There is no Disinfectant 2.5, and there won't be one! Disinfectant 2.4
>>works fine with System 7, provided you leave the Disinfectant INIT in

He then quotes "John's friend Chris" as saying:

>>I already have 2.5, and it is already posted on DDCBBS, in case you do
>>not believe that there is a version 2.5.  I would suggest looking into

He then asks:

>=========
>
>What gives?
>
>=========

I think the answer lies in the dates of the messages.  I downloaded
Disinfectant 2.5 yesterday (July 2), and noted in the help file that
John is working on a 3.0 version that will be a lot more at home in
System 7.  Presumably, he was already working on this on 20 May 91,
when his original message was posted, and was therefore expecting to
go from 2.4 straight to 3.0.  The recent discovery of a new strain of
the ZUC virus, however, prompted him to release an interim update to
2.5.

Unless someone has any proof to the contrary, I see no reason to
suspect that 2.5 is not a bona fide release of Disinfectant.

Yes Padgett, life is strange

Your society and mine both seem to think that anything needed should
be free for the asking. Any company who stands up and asks to be paid
for their efforts is going to get lots of complaints.

Actually, your postings and those from Aryeh Goretsky are clear and
useful reading. My thanks to both of you.

I would hardly call a license policy based on human nature a refusal
to sell a product. Everything I read from the McAfee group about their
license policies make a good deal of semse. They have a flexable
policy that covers everybody from the single PC owner user, right up
to a multinational company like the one I work for. You get what you
pay for people, and frankly, I think the product is worth the price.

Those who don't think the product is worth the price should quit
wasting bandwith and buy something else. It is abundantly clear that
McAfee has a product for sale, and very easy to find out what their
sales policies are for any given situation.

The only free lunch comes from friends, and even then it often isn't.

The above line(s) are mine, but may be the result of too much exposure
to a fictional character called L. Long.  TANSTAAFL makes sense to me!

NO!  If a diskette is write-protected (cover the notch, slide the
slide, whatever), the IBM floppy controller will not allow any writes
to that diskette.  Now, there have been weird failures of the write-
protect mechanism which have allowed writes (light bouncing around
because of a silver tab, light passing through a translucent disk
cover, a short in the write-protect detector, etc.).  One which I've
seen myself is an "electrical tape-like" write-protect tab which, when
used in a drive with a mechanical detector (a switch), eventually got
an indentation deep enough to let the switch engage, allowing writes
to the diskette.  In all of these cases, HARDWARE was at fault.  With
the present floppy controller system, software CANNOT bypass the
write-protect mechanism

    While I agree with Mr. Slade on the benefits of encrypting search
strings to prevent false positives, his statement:

> As Ross [Greenburg] has pointed out, no matter how well strings are
> encrypted, eventually someone will break the code, and then it is a

should not go uncontested.  This paraphrase contains two (mathematical,
not grammatical) infinitives, "no matter how well ... encrypted" and
"eventually".  If I can play with one infinitive, let alone two, I can
probably prove the world is flat (well, it _is_, locally) or some such.
Actually, what Mr. Greenburg wrote was:

>>                                      The bad guys can certainly break
>> whatever coding scheme I use, thereby using the string list just as if
>> it were not encoded at all.

    Mr. Greenburg's statement describes his assessment of his
abilities to develop/implement a cryptographic system.  If he says
that he cannot do something he believes to be difficult, so be it --
he knows where his strengths lie.

    On one hand, if all one is trying to do is prevent false positives
from other scanners, trivial bit flipping when the program is loaded
(to avoid "finding" their images on disk) and again at EOJ (to clean
up memory) will do just fine.

    And on the other hand, does anyone _really_ believe that the "bad
guys" _don't_ run the latest crop of anti-viral software to check that
their "products" won't be caught immediately?
