Subject: WARNING: Compuserve Virus Forum (PC)

The following is a note found on the Compuserve Virus Forum.

IMPORTANT NOTE - PLEASE READ

On September 18, it was discovered that a file uploaded to the suspect
file area of the Compuserve Virus Forum had been accidently unlocked
and made available for downloading from the suspected file area.  The
file, MOUSE.COM, was uploaded by user 73750,2417 for analysis as a
suspected infected file.  It contained the Taiwan 4 virus and it
clearly identified itself as containing a suspected virus during a
download.  Our records indicate that nine people downloaded the
infected file before the oversight was noticed and corrected.

While the library area containing this file clearly indicated that the
enclosed files were suspect and that the library should be used for
uploads only, we must assume that one or more of the downloaders may
have downloaded in error and are unaware of the potential danger.
Accordingly, we are urging all 9 people who downloaded this file to
contact McAfee Associates for instructions or assistance.

As a result of this error, we have decided to close down Library #0,
the Suspect Virus upload library.  Forum users may continue to submit
suspected viruses for review through Compuserve Mail to Aryeh Goretsky
(76702,1714) or Spencer Clark (76702,1713).  This change will prevent
this error from recurring.

We regret any inconvenience caused by closing Library 0, and we
further regret that anyone may have downloaded the infected file in
error.  For assistance or further questions, please contact McAfee
Associates at (408) 988-3832 during office hours, or send email to the
SysOps.

I believe this virus is a fairly new virus, as only some virus
detectors currently can locate it, and identify it as "Anticad" or as
a Jerusalem variant.  I'm still in the research mode on this.  If
anyone has any information, post it or send me mail.

Well, I'm not an administrator but I have been helping to implement
anti-viral policy at Dartmouth and its related schools (Engines, Medicine,
Business) for 4 years.

Dartmouth has tried very hard to keep viruses in the public eye so that
preventative measures do not fall by the way side. Disks distributed by the
College always have Disinfectant INIT on them if they have a System Folder
and the latest versions of PD/Shareware anti-viral packages are placed on
all the fileservers on campus within hours of their release. Numerous
clusters have dedicated scanning stations for user's disks... etc etc.

But there is a difference between making an effort to educate users and
simply scaring the hell out of them. Much of the hesitation involved in
anti-viral efforts is intended to prevent misinformation and needless worry.
Yes, we want the community here to be aware of computer viruses and take
measures to eliminate them but it is too easy to cause major problems by
letting people's imaginations run wild. (This is especially easy with Mac
users who tend to be less computer-literate. Since we have about 8000 mac
users here we have to tread carefully)

I don't know what's up at your school but much of the hesitation I've seen
here could be misinterpreted as an attempt at denial but in the end it is an
attempt at responsible dissemination of information.

Your mileage may vary...

The "unexpandable" PKLite compression is actually quite easy to expand
on a '386.  Load the program into td386 (Turbo debugger), single step
one instruction, set a hardware instruction fetch breakpoint at the
entry address (cs:100), and run the program.  The built-in
decompressing code will expand the program, and you'll get a hardware
breakpoint when the decompressor jumps to the actual program.  (The
entry address may vary; I've only seen a couple of examples of
nonminally unexpandable files.) A scanner could use the same technique
without the memory overhead of the debugger; the td386 technique is for
examining a file which you have reason to suspect may be infected.  I
would think that a scanner could also extract the decompressing code
from the executable, remove the jump to the expanded program, and use
that to expand without executing.

This way of infecting sounds quite similar as infection mechanism in
Tequila virus - maybe it is a modified variant of it?

This one is known amongst the virus researchers. At least Scanv80+ and
F-Prot 2.00 detects it. If you have those scanners and they don't pick
this virus up, you probably have a new variant of it. If this is the
case, I suggest you send it to some well-known virus researchers. BTW,
the authors of Tequila are known to Swiss police and most likely
they've written the Flip virus too.

interpreters that look for changes in interpreted information before
interpreting it".

What commercial products, shareware, or public domain software
falls into this category?  I know of plenty of products which fall
into Dr. Cohen's other three categories (scanners, monitors, and
cryptographic checksums), but cannot locate an "integrity shell".

Glad for you!

There is a virus named JOKER-01 with a visual effect similar to what
you wrote about. The virus intercepts hardware keyboard interrupt (INT
09) and triggers each 500 keys pressed/depressed. A funny human-like
face appears, swings its tongue several times and then disappears,
restoring previous screen. This virus infects .COM and .EXE files but
it doesn't touch files larger than 6795 bytes since it converts .EXE
to .COM and his own length is 29233 (!!!). As far as I know, AUTOCAD
is a little bit longer...

There are also several anti-Autocad viruses (TAIWAN, INVADER,
PLASTIQUE) from so-called TAIWAN family - a futher development of
well-known JERUSALEM virus. The author of these viruses seems to hate
Autocad.  If one tries to run a file named ACAD.EXE a virus triggers
and tries to overwrite all the info on all floppy and hard disks. Some
versions also destroy the CMOS contents.

I didn't reply at once since I was confused you mentioned both Autocad
and "moving mouth". Maybe somebody placed a demo of the JOKER virus at
your PC.

No, it wouldn't. FAT2 is also a subject to be modified by DOS.  So, a
virus using any of FATs for its own purposes, MUST be stealth.

Such a virus shouldn't just save a copy of occupied FAT somewhere else
- - where? - this will cause the original problem of saving an original
BOOT. We decided virus would save it in FAT - and where to save the
FAT?  So a virus must show another, not occupied by it, copy of FAT
each time its FAT is required. (I hope our discussion will not serve
as a guide for virus-writers... Once again, let us consider founding a
special teleconference with a restricted access for discussing such
things.)

Not ALL universities are turning a blind eye to the virus problem.
Here at Penn State, we've been virus-checking every startup disk used
in the labs every time it is used.  We've been doing this for over a
year now.

We also run the Disinfectant INIT on all startup disks.  We haven't
had a real virus problem since WDEF first appeared, and none of the
virus tools of the day could deal with it.  Sure, it takes a few
seconds to run each startup floppy through Disinfectant, but what else
are the lab attendants going to do all day?  :-)

Subject: Omicron virus knowns the TOKEN? (PC)

A few days ago, an experimental network at our projects department was
infected by the Omicron virus, the attack was detected, controlled an
terminated using CPAV (Central Point Anti-Virus, an excellent
product), the network is a Token-R ing LAN based on OS/2 v1.3 and
stations running DOS v5.0. The CPAV claims that the virus uses stealth
techniques, self-encription, and self-modifiying code, I want to Known
if anybody out there has an answer for the following questions:

1)-Does the Omicron virus knowns the Token?, can he capture a token, put a dest
ination address, insert himself on the token, an travel trough the network?

2)-What it means "Self-modifiying code", a MUTANT virus?, a mutation engine?

3)-Can the Omicron PT virus affect a network drive created by LAN Manager?

During the attack, some applications were destroyed, it seems that the
virus ca n affect data an .OVL files, but some stations that were not
infected (we check it), and did not perform a "net logon" operation,
were infected after, those s tations were running DLR (DOS LAN
Requester), and de NET.COM program, was found infected in all the
stations.

If anybody has ideas, please reply ASAP. Thanks in advance

I just want to reassure people that this head-in-the-sand approach is

periodically print art- icles in our newsletter, we distribute
Disinfectant in various ways (in- cluding making it available
electronically on our mainframe and public file servers, delivering it
to departments, and handing it out in our student labs), we run a
Disinfecting station where students can simply insert disks to be
checked, we post Disinfectant update announcements on our electronic
bulletin board, we refer to Disinfectant in our Mac classes, etc... I

Subject: FORM virus found (PC)

Someone here has managed to get his 3 1/2 floppy infected with a virus
detected as being the FORM virus by McAfee's SCAN. It infects the boot
sector. The effect of the virus was particularly "exotic":

"when the virus is in memory, execution of a DIR command will turn the
screen letters to bright white, and flash the background grey/black at
a rate of 1/2 Hz."

The virus was killed by saving the files on another disk and
reformatting the infected floppy.  What I'd like to know is if there's
a tidier way of killing it.  McAfee's CLEAN reported that the virus
could not be removed safely.

Any suggestions appreciated.

Subject: Boot sequence (PC)

FUNBOT2.CVP   910918

                          Boot sequence

In order to point out the areas of possible viral program attack, it is
helpful to outline the sequence of operations in the boot process.

When the machine is first powered up, there is a certain amount of
programming contained in boot ROM.  The amount of this varies greatly
between different types of machines, but basically describes the most
central devices, such as the screen and keyboard, and "points" to the
disk drives.  A very basic location on the disk is addressed for further
information.  This is the generic "boot sector"; as mentioned in the last
column, on MS-DOS hard disks it is the partition boot record that is
accessed first.

The boot record or sector contains further information about the
structure of the disk.  It, or a subsequent linked sector, also describes
the location of further operating system files.  This description is in
the form of a program, rather than simply data.  Because this outline is
in the form of a program, and because this sector is "writable", in order
to allow for different structures, the boot record or sector is
vulnerable to attack or change.  Boot sector infecting programs may
overwrite either the boot record or the boot sector, and may or may not
move the original boot sector or record to another location on disk.  The
repositioning of the original sector's program allows the viral program
to "pretend" that everything is as it was.

This pretence is not absolute.  A computer with an active viral program
resident will, of necessity, be different in some way from the normal
environment.  The original sector position will, of course, have
different information in it.  The viral program will need to "hook"
certain vectors for its own use in order to monitor activity within the
computer and in order to function.  The viral program will have to occupy
a certain portion of memory, and may be identified by a memory map, or,
in the case of the Stoned virus, may try to hide by "telling" the
computer that it has less memory than is actually the case.

These tell-tale indicators are not absolute.  There may be various
reasons why the "top of memory" marker is set to less than 640K.  Each
different type of disk drive, and each drive of the same type which is
partitioned differently, will have a different boot record.  As operating
systems or versions change, so will the boot sector.  Therefore, the
environment of newly booted machines cannot, in isolation, be examined
and said to be infected or free from infection.

It is possible, however, to compare any machine with itself in a "known
clean" state.  By saving information on the environment after a minimal
clean boot, and comparing this with subsequent boots, changes can be
detected, and the user alerted to a potential problem.  Since a boot
sector infector can only infect a machine if the machine is booted from
an infected disk, it is also possible to replace the boot record with a
non-standard one, in order to prevent access to the hard disk unless
booted from the hard disk.
