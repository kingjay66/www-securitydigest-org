VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

We advise users of the IBM Virus Scanning Program to use the -a
option during cleanup; that says to scan all files.   (We also
advise the use of -g, which says to report all signatures
everywhere, boot signatures in files, EXE signatures in COM-format
files, and so on; during cleanup.)

In general, unless you have a very critical system, I think this
is the right balance.   If you have an active infection, it's
going to infect *some* *.EXE or *.COM file (or one of the other
extensions we scan for by default), and then you'll know that
you should scan everything else, too.

There was a meeting held very recently of a so-called "steering
committee".  I believe the members of the steering committee include
Central Point, Certus, McAfee, Microcom and Symantec.

I would be interested in finding out what viruses they have.  The best
I can consider is that they are counting COM's and EXE's as different
viruses and counting minor varients of viruses as new/different ones,
two.

Subject: SAM Exceptions crashes my Mac (Mac)

Hi,

  We have just received our update to SAM 3.0.1 and have found a problem.
If we try to look at the 'exceptions' in the SAM Intercept then the
Macintosh crashes. Also, we have another copy on a IIsi, and because of
this crash (IMO), it continues to ask por permission to allow the
Moire cdev on startup - i.e. it ignores the Learn button. This does not
happen on the other Macs.
  Someone mentioned that there is now a version upgrade of 3.0.3. Is
this true?
  Any help would be greatly appreciated.
  Please e-mail to me on either of the addresses below.

Subject: WANTED: Master Index of IBM-PC Viruses (PC)

  Greetings! Is there a "master index" of all the viruses ever made for
the IBM-PC's (and compatibles)? I'm preparing a report on different virus
strains created for IBM-compatible machines, and I'd like to use the info-
rmation to add to my report.

  If such a "master index" is not available, could someone lead me to an
FTP site w/ virus reports (and descriptions of what the viruses affect/
destroy/change)?

  Thanx!

        Sounds like media hype - there are lots better ways to deactivate
        a  system than with a virus. A few years ago I was involved in  a
        program  to allow high-tech (for the time) system to be  sold  to
        people  we had reason to believe would try to "reverse  engineer"
        the  software. Some special hardware was used to prevent this.  A
        virus is software and is only effective if executed, something  a
        professional can detect and avoid.

        What  the virus is looking for is an MSDOS "spawn" action, not  a
        particular  extension  so it can infect anything  that  executes.
        Just because COMMAND.COM will only execute .EXE & .COM files does
        not  mean  that the CPU will not. The good news is  that  I  have
        never seen an infection that had not infected at least some  .COM
        or  .EXE  files  so intitial scanning may be  confined  to  these
        (plus  .SYS and .OV*). Once detected though, the only way  to  be
        sure of eradication is to check everything.

        This  is  a  good reason not to rely on just  one  product  -  my
        preference is a layered approach with at least three levels,  one
        normal  and  two dis-similar backups. If a product  is  not  sure
        that a file can be cleaned, it is often better for it not to try.

        Haven't  heard  of it but the membership sounds more  related  to
        advertising budgets if more details are available, would like  to
        know. On the subject, I was told last week that the next  release
        of  NAV will just use a single checksum file (like  Engima-Logic)
        rather than the innumerable 77 byte _whatevers.

Subject: Bus Error, Teenager Abuse (Mac)

     A message was posted on a customer's bulletin board system (of
which I am the sysop) asking about a problem on a member's Macintosh.
The author's daughter had complained that the Macintosh reported a
"Bus Error".  She then switched off the Macintosh.  When the author
turned it on, he had problems with the various options of the Control
Panel.  He also noticed that the System file had increased in size by
2.6M from its previous size on a backup diskette.  Both I and another
knowledgable participant in the bulletin board suggested that the most
likely cause of this behavior (growth in System file, altered behavior
of displays) was a virus.  The author said that he had used Apple's
virus scanner and did not think he had a virus.  He then added that
his daughter had been copying some sound at the time of the "Bus
Error".  Since sound effects and sound recordings are installable into
the System file, this explains almost everything.  The growth in the
System file is not a virus-like anomaly but an adolescent anomaly,
caused by the daughter installing sound.

     What caused the "Bus Error"?  Is this a hardware error with the
SCSI bus (which could have messed up the Control Panel)?  Should he
have his machine checked out?

          Neither my employer nor anyone else paid me to say this.

Since, you would not likely know which instance of such a weapon was
aimed at you, and since you might have little time to react, they
would all have to be triggered the same.  Since you would not have
much time to react, the triggering value would have to be widely
disseminated.  Such a widely disseminated value would be disclosed and
could then be used by an enemy to disarm weapons still in your hands.

This could be compensated for in part by distributing the disabling
value in a secure smart card.  This could discourage its replication,
and possibly even prevent its unauthorized use.

Any country known to be employing such a mechanism, even thought to be
employing such a mechanism, would be considered an unreliable source
for arms.  The very idea must already have had a chilling effect on
the arms trade.

Would there be any reason (apart from Frodo/4096 and its ilk) for
there to be a difference between the amount of memory reported by BIOS
and the amount of memory calculated by walking the DOS MCB chain?  Are
there any utilities that would have a (legitimate) reason to take over
a portion of high memory and fiddle with the DOS MCB chain?

information about the boot record and if/how it is different from a
normal DOS boot record.  Also, if anyone has any information on
previously published papers dealing with virus protection on a LAN, I

1.  Product Description:  TbScan is a copyrighted program written to detect
computer viruses and malicious programs for MS-DOS environments.

2.  Product Acquisition:  The program documentation states that TbScan
"can be used for free in non-commercial organisations and by private users.
Government and commercial organisations have to register the usage of TbScan".
There is a registration form included which describes costs, to include
multiple copy acquisitions.  Frans Veldman is the program author.  The
documentation gives the following address for more information:  ESaSS B.V,
P.O. Box 1380, 6501 BJ Nijmegen, The Netherlands.  The author has registered
the copyright and made the program available on many bulletin boards and
software repositories, to include the MS-DOS repository on simtel20 [192.88.
110.20].  The current path on simtel20 is pd1:<msdos.trojan-pro>tbscan28.zip.
On simtel20 the number "28" in the zipped file denotes version 2.8.  One will
also require a virus signature data file supplied by Jan Terpstra.  The path on
simtel20 is pd1:<msdos.trojan-pro>vs910731.zip.  This denotes a signature file
of 31 July 1991.  Since the signature file is updated frequently, users should
recognize that the path can change.
