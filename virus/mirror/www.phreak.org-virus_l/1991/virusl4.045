VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: Re: Research viruses

Research ethics are fairly well defined in other fields, and can be
extended to computer viruses with a little thought.

For instance, a researcher working on flu virus strains would be
ethically (and legally) responsible for a mutated virus escaping into
the population at large.  Saying "I'm sorry -- I didn't mean for it to
happen" is not an excuse.  Good intentions do not substitute for
taking precautions.

Research on (computer) viruses that escape into the general population
are clearly unethical because they affect subjects who have not given
their informed consent to be part of the "experiment," and there is no
way to end the "experiment."  Also, there is no valid control for the
experiment (e.g., "What would be the results in a similar population
for the null hypothesis?").

Worse, most people "experimenting" doen't understand the basics of
good scientific method.  Research by writing viruses to see what
happens is akin to throwing chemicals in a test tube to see if it
explodes.  Proper experimental research procedure requires that you
establish a hypothesis that can be tested, establish a test with
controls, and then analyze your test results with respect to the
hypothesis.

Some of the people who claim they are doing "research" in viruses and
related areas are doing no such thing.  I have refereed papers for
professional forums that show a surprising lack of understanding of
the basic principles of science or ethics -- then these individuals
complain they are being "conspired against" because they can't get
their work published.  Sad.

   Hi, RED-users.

   I have a hard disk with 2048 bytes per sector, and when I run the
newest versions of SCAN (74b and 75) the program reports the following
message :

  "Sorry, the partition table of disk C is 2048 bytes long."
  "That's too big for me."

   Is that a bug in the program?  Am I doing anything wrong?

   Thanks in advance for your answers,

I just received word from McAfee Associates that they have agreed to
upload each new release of McAfee anti-viral programs for MS-DOS to
Detroit Download Central, the BBS I co-SysOp.  From there I will
transfer the files in their original form to SIMTEL20.

What this means to Internet users is that the programs will be
available for downloading from SIMTEL20, and the mirror sites, within
12 hours of their release by McAfee.

On the Hannover-fair "CeBit" a Virus-Construction-Set for MS-DOS was
found in a BBS. The BBS is a German system called "ZERBERUS". The
program was uploaded in Hamburg. The Box-Sysops are informed and will
(hopefully) delete the entries.

It is possible to build a virus that will display a massage at a
selectable generation-count. At the same time the files "CONFIG.SYS"
and "AUTOEXEC.BAT" will be deleted.

The virus will be given the name "VCS-1.0".
The virus extends programs by 1077 Bytes.
The following string can be found at offset 50h:"A5 A5 A4 68 00 C1 C3 8A"
At the end of the virus "C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT" and "C:\CONFIG.SYS"

Codeanalysis will begin soon after the fair.

One of my colleagues was sent the english version demo disk of the
program VCH BIBLIO. Disk 2 (of 2) was found to be infected by the
virus 1701/1704 by McAfee's VIRUSCAN. We have reported this to the
British distributors of this disk. They are A-MAIL of Oxford.  They
found their systems to be infected when we reported it to them.  The
VCH program originates in Germany though we do not know if the German
version was infected. I have reported this finding to Noel Bonczonzek
at the UK Computer Crime Unit.

Subject: New Virus ? Smiley Virus - Amiga

I was playing with my WB disk when the mouse pointer turned into a
PacMan like object, with a scrolling message under it saying something
like :

"This is a new virus from Centurions, and it's called Smiley Virus.
It seems that some of your disks have been infected !"

I tried to take it away with ZeroVirus III, but it did not recognize it.
I took a look into memory, using VMK tool, included in DW 1.2.
I saw that there was something like "startup-sequence", ares, etc.

Looking in my startup-sequence, I saw that the first command was
"Ares", so I thought the virus had copied itself in that command. I
reinstalled Arp on the infected disk (to prevent the virus had
infected some other command).  Then I turned down the machine and
bootstrapped from the infected disk.  Looking in memory with VMK gave
"No Virus Present" as result, so I felt immediately happy !

Anyway, I'd just love to know which is the latest Anti-Virus for The Amy.

Probably because stoned steals 2K for itself(why 2K I dunno, I think
he only needs to dec al once?, figured its a bug). It then updates the
BIOS data segment (413h) to indicate that the tip-top of memory is
right below it.  Scan utilities that rely on that table being accurate
might not bother to check any higher.

(An aside note: the 'stoned' program compares the jump at its first
location with that of the boot sector on the potential target in order
to decide if its already 'infected' said target.  If you haven't
already you might dis-assemble and modify your boot sector code to
reflect the identical jump so that it looks like its already
infected...)

General Description:

The NAV.EXE program has the ability to scan memory, boot sectors and
files for the presence of known viral programs, and to "inoculate"
programs against change.  It can also recover some damage to programs
and boot sectors.  The NAV_.SYS program provides TSR checking of files,
although it does not detect viral programs in memory, or deal
effectively with boot sector viri.

                  Comparison of features and specifications



User Friendliness

Installation

The program is shipped on "read only" disks, therefore cannot be
infected at the user's site without active intervention.

It is absolutely essential to read the on disk READ.ME file, as the
documentation is incorrect in many places including installation.  The
printed documentation fails to mention the NAV.DEF virus definition file
and the program will not function without it.

Installation can be done from any drive to any drive, including floppy
drives.  If old versions of Norton Antivirus are found they can be
overwritten or backed up at the user's discretion.  The installation
program is clear and simple to use, and gives clear instructions and
explanations of the various options.  (With some exceptions.  For
example, the program assumes that old copies of NAV are to be found in
C:\NAV, and states that there is no old version if nothing is found
there.  If this is not the path for the files, and the proper path is
specified, the request to choose between backing up and overwriting old
versions comes shortly after the announcement that there are no old
versions.)  A "completion bar" shows the progress of most lengthy
operations (throughout the program.)

The installation is quite intelligent and useful in dealing with the
necessary changes to system files.  An editing screen is presented for
the insertion of the command line in CONFIG.SYS.  The default placement
is explained clearly enough to give novices confidence, but will allow
more advanced users the ability to select optimum positioning.  Backup
files are created for the original AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS.

The installation program is not very intelligent in dealing with
configuration options.  Upon invocation of the installation program, it
asks about the type of monitor used.  Upon completion, however, the
configuration of the NAV program defaults to "CGA" monitor type, which
does not allow some options or "command keys" to be seen on monochrome
screens.  Also upon completion, if "Quit" is chosen instead of "Reboot",
the "target" drive and directory becomes default.

Ease of use

The program is "menu driven", but use without a mouse is not necessarily
intuitive, nor do all menus work consistently.  (For example, all
options on the main menu are accessed by initial letter except "Exit"
which is only accessible by pressing the "X" or "ESC" keys.)  Ten pages
of the manual are devoted to the use of the interface.  The menus are,
however, generally clear and readable.  (Unless, as mentioned above, the
monitor type is not consistent with "highlights" generated in CGA mode.)

The "Advanced scan" and "Auto-inoculate" features of the system are
simply variations on checksumming and change detection, but are set up
and explained in a manner which appears to be unnecessarily confusing.
The options available in the "Options/Configuration" menu allow for a
considerable degree of customization, but reasons for choosing certain
options are not clear in the initial installation section of the manual.
The monitor "box" in the menu is not accessible in any way, nor is it
explained in either the manual or the help text.  Some options do not
appear to work: I did not chose to "Disable scan Cancel *b*utton" (*b*
being the letter used to access this option), but the "cancel scan"
option was disabled on my program anyway.

If a virus is detected in memory at the beginning of a scan, the program
will refuse to scan further.  This is an advantage in that it prevents
infection by viri which infect each file as it is open, but there is no
"discretion" on this feature, and it activates even when boot sector
viri are found.  The program does not terminate, but will not perform
(in terms of scanning).  No help is given at this point: the user is
referred to a section of the manual.

Help systems

The program contains an extensive help file.  Personally, I did not find
the onscreen help to be very useful, generally having to go to the
reference section of the manual if I could not figure out the operation
from the menus.

Compatibility

Norton Antivirus is stated to be compatible with Windows.  However,
careful examination of the disk READ.ME file indicates that this
compatibility is true only in that the TSR scanner can continue to alert
users through the "siren" if the "alert boxes" are turned off while
Windows is in operation.  NAV is not compatible with Desqview, and has
difficulty with a number of other TSRs and related utilities.  Careful
reading of the READ.ME file is suggested on systems with extensive use
of TSR programs.

The program shipped as of December 7, 1990 identifies a significant
proportion of the viral programs identified by the Brunnstein, Hoffman,
McAfee and Skulason lists.  The company has also provided a means of
regular updates of "signature" information.

The "change detection" information is not added to the file to be
checked, so it does not interfere with "internal" self checks.  However,
the information is not stored in a single outside file, but in a
"hidden, system" file created for each program to be checked.  As the
READ.ME file indicates, this may take up considerable space on a hard
disk, and may be difficult to recover even after programs are removed.

Company Stability

Symantec and Peter Norton have both been solid companies in their
respective environments.

Company Support

The company provides both a technical support line and a "Virus
Newsline" for update information on new viral signatures.  There is
provision for access to information through "voice mail", fax and
commercial information services.  Suggestions from the company indicate
that this is seen as valuable primarily to corporate customers, who can
take advantage of economies of scale in distributing the information
internally and recovering the cost of obtaining the information.

It should be noted that although the program was promised to the
reviewer in November, that it required eleven return phone calls to five
different offices to finally have it delivered over three months later.

Documentation

The documentation is extensive, but the layout would not be simple for a
novice to follow.  While the information is all there, even after a
thorough reading it is hard to remember where a specific item is.  The
"Quick Start" section does provide an acceptable installation, if
default values are all valid in the user's system.

The "clean start" provisions of both the "Quick Start" and installation
sections should prevent installation on an infected system *if followed
rigorously*.  However, even here the directions may be confusing to a
novice.  The "About Viruses" section is of little use.

As mentioned before, many corrections and omissions from the manual are
pointed out in the READ.ME file on disk, and the documentation should
not be considered complete without it.

Hardware Requirements

No special hardware is required.

Performance

As mentioned, the NAV program identifies a larger number of viral
signatures than does any commercial product reviewed to date, with
provisions for constant updating of the signature files.  The scanning
is also very fast, approaching the speed of TBSCAN and VPCSCAN.

The TSR scanner, NAV_.SYS, is invoked from CONFIG.SYS (cf F-DRIVER.SYS
in the FPROT package.)  While it cannot prevent infection of the system
from a "boot sector" infected diskette, it does not detect the presence
of such a virus in memory, and it neither prevents infection of
diskettes, nor alerts the user to the use of an infected diskette or the
operation of infecting.

Repair of viral programs appeared to be affective.

Local Support

Although local sales offices of Symantec/Peter Norton are widely
available, support is only provided through the central technical
support and "Virus Newsline" numbers.

Support Requirements

In its current form, the product is suitable for novice users, but
installation and actions when a virus is found may require more expert
support.

                                 General Notes

The provision of access to update information gives this product a
significant advantage.  There are, however, some weaknesses to be dealt
with, and a general improvement is needed in the documentation and ease
of use before it is suitable for all users.
