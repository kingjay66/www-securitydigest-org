"Morris Worms Through Courts
 There's a chance that the U.S. Supreme Court could hear
 the renowned Internet network "worm" case during its ses-
 sion that begins next month.  An attorney for Robert T.
 Morris, the former graduate student convicted of unleash-
 ing on the Internet a rogue computer program called a
 worm, in June asked the Supreme Court to review a U.S.
 Appeals Court decision upholding charges that Morris
 broke a federal computer security law when he sent out his
 worm program.  Morris maintains that he didn't mean to
 cause harm with his program--only to show the security
 holes in the Unix operating system."

I have not had direct experience with PathWorks, but I can offer this
opinion.

The 1701, 1704 (Cascade) virus and related variants are resident file
infecting viruses.  Because systems like PathWorks emulate a DOS
environment, the actual format of a disk is invisible to applications
and viruses.  (atleast for the most part)  Therefore, file infecting
viruses, such as Cascade, can infect files stored on your DOS partition.
If you can access this partition like you would any other physical or
logical drive, it is possible that this and other viruses can infect
files stored on a virtual disk.  Even if a virus is unable to
propagate across your network, you can still store an infected file
on a virtual disk.  Therefore, it is my opinion that your virtual
disk (or rather files stored on that disk) is not immune to virus
attack, either directly or indirectly.

The clean-up and protection of this type of networked environment
requires a slightly different approach than standalone computers.
Padgett Peterson has made a few brief postings on what is required
for such an effort.  I have been working on a system that I call
a network virus monitor which uses concepts similar to Padget's.
I hate to think about cleaning up a large, widely-infected network.
It is for this reason that I am placing a high priority on network
protection.

When you load MONITOR (in Novell 386 v3.xx, not Novell 286 v2.1x), you get
the monitor screen with several options.  However, after 5 minutes or so,
MONITOR will place the "worm" on the screen as a screen-blanking device.
On a monochrome monitor, different worm segments will appear as different
shades of gray.  On a color screen, you will see different worm segments
as different colors.  As soon as you hit a key (ESC or anything else), the
blanking stops and you return to the MONITOR screen.  (FYI, the SMTP
program Charon uses the same screen blanking "worm" figure).

One interesting note:  The length and speed of the "screen worm" is based
on the server utilization.  The higher the server utilization, the faster
and longer the worm gets.

Not a trojan, not a virus, just a screen blanker.  Nothing to worry about.

They came across with no problems.  I have begun testing them and so
far I like them.  The only problem I have seen so far is that it is
not a good idea to run SAFEMBR twice on the same system.  It does not

  This is an appealing position, but as I pointed out to Fred (Cohen)
and Len (Adelman) in class some years ago, it is not workable, or even
useful.  Since Fred (Waller) gives no details about the proposed
hardware, I will propose my own hardware virus solution, and
demonstrate its problems.  If this is not what was discussed, if I
somehow missed the proposal, please forgive me, and point out how your
proposals avoid my criticisms.  Be sure to read all the way to the
end, and be sure you understand my criticisms though.

		      Jay's Virus Proof Machine

  Jay's Virus Proof Machine has two disk drives a "program" disk and a
"data" disk.  It also had a big red switch labeled "install/run".

   When the switch is in the "run" mode, the computer behaves normally,
with two exceptions, the "program" diskdrive is not writable, and
programs can only be run from the "program" disk.  Since the switch
directly switches the write current wire of the "program" disk, no
software is able to circumvent it and write to the "program" disk.
That programs can only be run from the "program" disk is again
incontravertable hardware fact (think about a "harvard" architecture
machine).  So, in "run" we seem to be safe from viruses -- no running
program can infect any other runable program.

  When the switch is turned to the "install" position, the computer
reboots and runs a very tiny (< 5k), very dumb program called
Installation Software (IS).  The IS is only capable of moving files
from the "data" disk to the "program" disk, of renaming files on the
"program" disk and of deleting them.  It can not run any programs.  Of
course, the IS is stored on the "program" disk, or better yet in ROM.
So it seems that in "install" mode we are also safe from viruses.

  (Since I am dreaming I will add that the tiny IS has been
mathematically proven correct by ten different University and
Commercial groups, and has been available for ten years for crackers
to crunch on with an offer of $1000000 to anyone to defeat it.  No one
has yet.)

  In summary, only in "run" mode can programs (other than the dumb IS)
be run, they must all come from the "program" disk, and in "run" mode
the "program" disk cannot be written to.  And in "install" mode only
one program, proven very safe, can be run.  Great!  No virus is
possible!

  Sounds good huh?  It wont work.  It WILL make the life of computer
users miserable, but it WONT prevent the spread of viruses.

  This scheme fails because it does not take into account the
observation (invention?) that some bright guy (Von Neuman?) made in
the 50's -- You can't tell program from data.  You just can't.

  Where should I store my spread sheets?  Either they are on the
"data" disk (and thus ripe for (with?) viruses) or they are on the
"program" disk.  If they are on the "program" disk then they are hard
to modify, and what use is a spread sheet if you can't modify it?

  This scheme will only stop viruses if users are willing to live
without interpreters.  How many interpreters do you use in a day?
Command interpreters, spread sheets, text editors, and even terminal
emulators all very often have (or are) interpreters.  Are you ready to
give up the ability to easly develop programs for those interpreters?
I am not.

  (You might think that people would not write viruses for those weak
interpreters.  But you'd be wrong.  I've heard of viruses infecting
hypercard stacks, spread sheets, and even command interpreter scripts
(In fact Fred Cohen wrote a few himself!).)

  Sadly, the proposed scheme doesn't even prevent viruses from
spreading.  Take me as an example, I work on a very advanced CASE tool
which my company sells.  Suppose we became infected with some very
tricky virus.  Our "safe" programs could be sent out, and our
infection could spread to other developers and users.  After all, at
some point our program must exist on some "data" disk, and at that
point the virus could infect the "data" before it is moved to a
"program" disk.  In fact, that is how we were infected, yeah thats it,
its all PicoSoft's fault!  Their compiler has bugs AND viruses!  (You
should be sure to ignore their claim that it was a previous version of
our CASE tool which infected them. :->)

  Fred (Cohen) proved it very well, go read his thesis.  The cost of
eliminating viruses is very high, I doubt anyone will want to pay it.
You are simply required to stop using stored program computers, or to
stop bringing any (possibly infected) stored programs to your system.
If you wish to use stored program computers (I do) you will have to
accept the truth that ...

  there is no unstopable virus, and no virus proof shield.

j'

P.S.  After an especially paranoid Philip K. Dick book, I dreamt of a
CPU infected with a virus designed into it by the CAD software running
on another infected CPU.  The chip virus insures that a engines made
to run in a certain brand of car, after a few tens of thousands of
miles, stop working.  But I woke up... didn't I?

P.P.S.  I got the idea of a computer virus from an old S.F. book.  In
the book they actually describe a worm (and called it that) in the
phone system, but it was easy to see from the description how to write
a virus, and why you might want to.  I discused the idea with a
friend.  He and I became very excited, and went to our bosses and
described it, as well as our intention to write one.  Our bosses said
that if we wrote one, we would be fired.  Later we mentioned the idea
to Fred and Len in class, and it took off.  This was in 1983 or 4.
Does any one know the name of that book, or of an earlyer reference to
computer viruses?

Many PCs already have enough hardware to allow construction of a
perfect protection against viruses. The only thing needed is a
processor with memory protection. Unfortunately, the popular operating
systems do not support memory protection. Maybe things will change if
OS/2 becomes popular.

 MY PC was stoned yesterday. After I run some game program from my

stay on drive A with light on and go no further. If I put a disk which
has a DOS system file on it in the drive A, it still doesn't work but
will show a message " your PC is now stoned". But if I use DOS 4.0 to
boot the PC on drive A, it works ,from there I can get into C drive.
Then I run Anti-virus program, but it didn't show any virus
information. What I should do ? please help. Thank you very much.

Subject: "Terminal Compromise" Inter.Pact Press (615)883-6741

     Have  just  finished the novel by Winn Schwartau and  it  is
amazing  how  many  influential  people I  am  hearing  echo  its
concepts.  This  is an important book for the  computer  security
industry and puts into both readable English and perspective many
of  the concerns that exist. This is the "Cuckoo's Egg"  of  1991
without the recipe for chocolate chip cookies. The scary part  is
that I have seen many of the penetration techniques used. Each is
very real and very possible.

     However,  when reading the book, it must be remembered  that
this is a "worst case" scenario and rests on the popular  premise
that  "Viruses  are just programs, computers  executed  programs,
therefore  computers  cannot differentiate  between  viruses  and
legitimate  programs".  While it sounds good,  like  the  Lorenz-
Fitzgerald equation often used to "prove" that you cannot  exceed
the  speed  of light, it breaks down upon examination  (e.g.  you
only achieve the effect of infinite mass if exactly lightspeed is
maintained  for  an  infinite time - an  integral  taken  to  the
limit).

     As  a matter of fact, some interesting energy  relationships
derive if an object is held at lightspeed for a finite time.

     Meanwhile, back at the ranch: while it is true that  viruses
are only collections of instructions, they are instructions  that
do  things  that normally should not be done and * this  *  is  *
detectable *.

     As  an  extreme case, the DATACRIME (actually  a  very  poor
virus  but  mentioned several times in the book)  when  triggered
attempts to format the disk using a special function of Interrupt
13. Since this function is ONLY used for this purpose, turning is
off/flagging  attempts is simple with software  (DiskSecure  does
this at the BIOS level).

     Of  course, the point could be made that other software  can
defeat  software. This is true, but it is difficult for  software
to defeat software unless it knows exactly what and where it  is.
Since  I  have other programs that  just  periodically  validates
DiskSecure, a virus would have to target these as well and  there
are  several variants (see my discussion of simple  but  multiple
encryption  techniques in last Spring's V-L).

     Now  if everyone used DiskSecure, virus writers  could  just
target  it,  however if MicroSoft, Norton, Mace,  Central  Point,
Digital  Research, and all the others came out with  similar  but
different software, and AMI, Phoenix, Award, and Tandon each  had
a  different  BIOS  implementation a  generic  virus  becomes  so
difficult  to write and would have to be so big to handle all  of
the cases the it would become uneconomical: this is the reason  I
give the concepts away.

     Thus  while "Terminal Compromise" is an important  book  and
should be widely read, it is equally important to remember that *
there  *  are * practical * solutions *, we just  have  not  been
willing to demand them. For example, much is made of reading  CRT
display  emissions from a distance. If you are truely  concerned,
there is a simple answer: LCD displays. In addition, I have  seen
TEMPEST CRT filters advertised as well. Everyone has one, Right ?

     The basic premise is true though: much of the nation's  (and
the  world's)  information processing capability is a  risk,  not
because it cannot be protected, but because we have not  bothered
to  do so. The important thing is that we do not need the NSA  to
help/approve, it is just a matter of doing.

  [NOTE: Fred (Waller)'s articles did not "give details about the

  a little more specific this time].   Jay Skeer continues:

  Jay Skeer's message brought to mind a rather similar machine
  that Fred (Waller) once devised:

                      Fred's Virus-Resistant Machine
                      ------------------------------
 Fred's Virus-Resistant Machine also had two disk drives, a "program"
 disk and a "data" disk.   It, too, had a _small_ switch (not red),
 labeled: "Install/Run".

   (Notice that unlike Jay's Machine, Fred's machine was not Virus-
   Proof but only Virus-Resistant. Is Fred more modest in his goals
   than Jay...?    He also added some few extra touches that Jay
   didn't think of, and his switch was rather smallish, and not red).
                               ---

 The rest of Jay's description approaches Fred's own design fairly.
 In fact, the similarity is so close that Fred thinks that Jay
 managed to slip into a time warp and snatch Fred's ideas before they
 had even been conceived!   (Snatching ideas before they are even
 conceived is a disconcerting habit which should be discouraged).

 There was, however, a very important difference between Jay's Virus-
 Proof Machine and Fred's Virus-Resistant one.  This difference was
 that while Jay simply *imagined* such a design, and then went about
 demolishing his own idea (in theory), Fred went and actually *built*
 a machine, and didn't demolish it (even in practice).  Then, while
 Jay was lucubrating on Fred (Cohen)'s theory, Fred (Waller) got hold
 of his pet viruses and tried to infect his virus-resistant machine.

 Quoting Jay Skeer further:

 Well, I don't know about Jay Skeer, but Fred (Waller), not being a
 a bright Hungarian like v.Neumann., didn't know that.  He only knew
 that v.Neumann had proposed to store instructions and data together,
 intermixed in the storage medium, and that this created an ambiguity
 of interpretation, and allowed instructions to be self-modifying,
 (the so-called "bad programming" of some), and that the ambiguity
 could be resolved (though temporarily) when the stored element was
 fetched from storage and either executed or operated on.

 Unlike Jay, Fred (Waller) also had this silly idea that it isn't
 necessary to make viruses impossible in order to provide adequate
 defenses against them.  He didn't care if they existed, as long as
 it was somewhere else.

 But, regardless of abstruse theory, Fred (W) read in his MS DOS
 manual that program files went under DOS extensions like .COM, .EXE,
 .OVR...   Knowing this, he had no trouble telling them apart from
 .TXT, .DAT, .DOC and .WK1 files.   So, unaware that his machine
 couldn't work, he went ahead and started testing it.  (He did,
 however, believe that the design details of hardware protection
 couldn't be derived from solely symbolic considerations).

         As Jay Wakes Up, Fred (W) Continues Sleeping
         --------------------------------------------
 While sleeping thus, he tried Boot infectors and he tried executable
 infectors. He tried stealth viruses and candid ones, viruses that
 self-encrypt and mutate and he tried others that do none of those
 things.  He even intentionally allowed viruses on the `program'
 disk, but kept the little switch in its safe position.  He had TSR
 viruses, and transient viruses, big ones, little ones, American,
 Israeli and Bulgarian, "wild" and "research" viruses, smart and
 dumb ones... he tried them all.

 In this way, while Jay decided that his machine couldn't possibly
 work, Fred discovered that his machine (which wasn't virus-proof,
 but only virus-resistant)  *did* work, and extremely well. None of
 his favorite viruses (hundreds of them, my goodness!) succeeded in
 infecting it.  Since he always booted from a clean disk (the safe
 "program" disk or a trusted diskette), he had no Boot infectors
 in RAM. Some of his viruses did freeze the machine but he was
 able to reboot without infection and kept smiling.

 Fred (Waller) used his word processor, and an electronic spreadsheet,
 which he stole from his wife. He installed a DOS shell and used a
 database manager. He tried his telecomm program, which has terminal-
 emulation facilities, and he emulated terminals.  Fred created
 spreadsheets, letters to his friends (and to one enemy), and
 developed a database to organize some long-forgotten and mysterious
 writings of his. All this time, his test viruses were furiously
 banging their symbolic little heads and pushing their symbolic little
 bodies against the invincible hardware of his little (not red) write-
 protect switch.

 Fred compressed files and used TSRs and run DOS 5.0 and used
 spelling checkers; he copied data files and he erased them. In short,
 Fred (Waller) did all those "interpreter" things that Jay wrote
 about, and they had no problem interpreting whatever it is they
 needed to interpret.  The viruses, however, seemed to have all kinds
 of problems getting "interpreted"...  :-)  Also, DOS 5.0's SETVER
 command was, ahh... confused at times <sigh>.  A minor price to pay
 for all the protection.  So Fred decided to call SETVER a `bad
 program' and let Frisk's heuristic analyzer bury it.

 Thus, while Jay's Virus-proof Machine appeared to him not to be
 very virus-resistant, Fred's Virus-resistant Machine turned out
 to be rather virus-proof!  Fred (Waller) attributes this amazing
 effect to a little-known characteristic of time warps, called the
 Retro-revengful anti-theoretical somersault.

 Now, Fred (Waller) is searching Fred (Cohen)'s thesis, von Neumann's
 works and and other writings trying to discover what he did wrong.
 Obviously, his machine should have failed... but didn't.  Fred
 (Waller) is very ashamed of this.  He'll try to rectify this
 unseemly situation, and will try to come up with a theoretically-
 correct, totally ineffective machine just as soon as he can.

 Oh, Fred (W) would be very interested in seeing a sample of any
 virus that could infect his machine.  Perhaps Jay Skeer could
 provide him one?   A high-voltage virus, maybe?

This worm in MONITOR is a screen saver and not to be worried about!

BTW, I've heard a few reports of MONITOR crashing a server when it's
left loaded on a for a number of hours. Best to unload it each time
you've finished at the console

1) DIR2CLR:	the file xxdecoded fine, now in [.msdos.antivirus]
2) VIRX 1.8:	I fetched the file yesterday from SIMTEL20, and have it now
		available form the same directory.

Please note that when you do a FTP from our site you'll be in the [anonymous]
directory, and will have to change to [msdos.antivirus].
