VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,

I have to agree that software changeable BIOS is a scarey thought, but
an alternative to the 'catridge' idea would be the imposition of a
hardware switch which permits BIOS writing.  The update program could
request the user to 'Press the button marked BIOS and hold it down
until the update is finished.'

Probably not as reliable as the 'BIOS cartridge', but still, it is a
thought.

There is absolutely nothing new in this ad.  There are zillions of
checksum programs for the PC which claim to do the very same thing.
However, there are three things to note: (1) They cannot distinguish
between an actual viral infection and (say) replacement of an old
version of a program by a new one; this is left to the user to decide.
(2) The vast majority of such programs cannot really catch *all*
infec- tions because DOS has loopholes which the authors of these
programs are unaware of.  (3) This method only *detects* infections
after they have occurred; it does not prevent or remove them, so
there's still a wee bit left for the "experts" to do.

  Actually, there is one such program, V-Analyst, which goes a long
way toward solving all three problems: (1) It can distinguish between
the above two situations in *most* cases.  (2) It checks for three
loopholes and takes the necessary measures.  (3) It contains a
*generic disinfector* which, when a modification is detected, will
attempt to restore the file to its original condition.  If the
modification is due to a virus, it can do this in the great majority
of cases (regard- less of whether the virus is known or unknown).
Moreover, there is never any danger of its performing an incorrect
restoration.  (Features (1) and (3) are available only in the new
version 3.0, not yet offi- cially released.)
  I'm willing to bet that Vaccine doesn't come anywhere near this.

Answer: Who says a checksum program has to go resident at all??  Most
checksum programs I know of (incl. Vaccine and V-Analyst) can (or
must) be run without going resident.

For what its worth, the individual virus files in PCVI305 are in
ASCII, it is the selector/viewer that is a program.

Since I automatically filter VIRUSSUM and reformat with form feeds
after each listing so that it goes into a loose leaf easily, I have
felt for some time that this would be nicer and allow "updates"
monthly rather than having to download/print the whole thing each
month. Telco fees can add up.

The only problem with such a flat file arrangement (access can be very
fast) is that it takes up a lot of disk space (200 viruses @ 2k per
cluster = 400k - smaller on floppy of course).

The big thing to remember is that VIRUSSUM is copyrighted material and
Patricia has put a lot of effort into it. Her decision on whether it
exists at all is final.

While I follow the premise better now, what you are talking about is
what I referred to in the third option - somehow swapping ROM
addresses for RAM addresses or possibly a "page frame" approach such
as used for expanded memory. It will take a special BIOS driver to
accomodate just like a RAM-disk requires a special driver and the data
areas will have to stay resident somewhere. The point is that there
are a finite number of addresses available and if some are used for
ROM then there are that many less for RAM unless some extra memory
management scheme is used such as that used for "shadow RAM" on 386s -
not difficult but requires a few extras.

The point I was trying to make was that even with this type of
mechanism, the same holes exist in MS-DOS as did before. Some have
been moved (e.g.  the first attackable point) so that specific
malicious software will be thwarted, but the hole still exists and
will just be exploited in the next crop. There is still NO integrity
management in MS-DOS.

Subject: F-Driver.SYS and QEMM (PC)

Yesterday I re-optimized my memory allocation on a Zenith 386-SX
because it had lost 2K of memory.  As it ran through the process, the
Stoned virus was detected, and the system froze, as it should have.
However, the station had been used on and off several times since its
infection, with no detection by f-driver.sys (ver 1.15A), and I
suspect that the reason for this is that it had been loaded into high
RAM by QEMM when running OPTIMIZE.  I do not recall reading anything
about this in the F-PROT documentation.

Subject: Network World Article (PC)

The May 27th Network World has a nice article on viruses and
networks/lans.  It talks about how viruses have progressed from an
annoyance to a major problem (surely news to everyone here), quoting a
study by Certus International where 50% of 2500 selected sites (with
400 or more micros) had reported problems with viruses.

Lans are stated to be a major conributor to the spread of viruses.

The section of the article of some interest to me was a test of 21
virus scanning packages conducted by the NCSA.  An accompanying chart
shows the percentage of detection by the packages against 921 viruses.
Here's how the rankings went (only 15 of the 21 were reported for some
reason):

Hmmm.  Interesting definition.  I use "variable encoding" to indicate
that something in the virus is designed to thwart scanners: variable
"NOP" type instructions, that kinda stuff.  I use "encryption" to
indicate that the code has been mangled in some form, regardless of
how many methods a given program uses.  That would make Tequila a
"variable encoding encrypted" virus, I guess.  Pain in the butt, in
any case.

That is too obviously backwards to require stats and is not what I was
implying.  Of course having 16 bytes with no wild cards *should* be
more specific that 16 bytes with wildcards.

If the seed is entered by the user, then there might well be problems
of getting "pre-installed" copies within an organization that al share
the same seed.  Just as an example: one site license on FLU_SHOT+
pre-installed it on about 300 machines.  Just by chance the installer
was running DOS 4.01 on his machine, everybody else was running DOS
3.3.  Obviously, the checksums on the system files and COMMAND.COM
were different and I got umpteen tech support calls on the "problem".
Now, this was a major problem because of installation done beforehand.
Imagine my problem if each checksum was altered slightly with a
different seed?  Unless they tell me the seed (or I play games to
derive the seed), I have a major tech support problem.

And if they have the seed stored on the system anywhere -- sorta
required in order for it to work! -- then the bad guy can find it just
as easily as my own code can.  It buys the end user nothing, in my
opinion, but causes a major support headache.

If you want RACF on a PC, you'll have to change operating system, I
think.  It looks like you're speaking of authenticity and access
control -- these must be considered important *parts* of an anti-viral
package.  But not the whole thing.

Pre-installed products will have a problem as mentioned above. Many sites
don't want to install each package individually on individual machines.

Once advised, sure.  Until then...how does one know?  This will always
be a one-version-off problem.

See the compatability problem you mention above.  A bug has to be fixed
and not all compatability problems can be determined at release time. As for
virus scanners:  my first product in the arena used a brute force method
of scanning, back when I had about 50 strings.  I have about 500 now. The
same technique would have you waiting ten times longer.  One method was quite
appropriate a year ago, a different one now.  Once DOS 2.x ruled the earth,
but lots of dinosaurs get extinct.  Upgrades are required in many cases, says
this mammal.

Difficult to maintain system integrity there while doing "dangerous" things,
though.  But agreed.

Actually, to be more specific, it will merely be removed from the .ZIP
file.  It will still be available for download from my BBS and from
other sites -- including SIMTEL-20, since I'll be loading it to Keith
directly henceforth.  And, please, take the quote from the word

It will still be distributed on the disks of registered FLU_SHOT+
