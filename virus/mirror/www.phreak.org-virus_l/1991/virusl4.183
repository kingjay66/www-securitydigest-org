To elaborate this: The virus occupies two clusters when the cluster
size is less than 1024 bytes (2 sectors). This happens on 1.2 and 1.44
Mb diskettes.

Thanks for reminding about that; I forgot to mention it. The virus
indeed performs some checks on the file length. The smallest
infectable files are 2048 bytes. There is also an upper limit, but
it's quite large - somthing about 4 Mb.

You probably mean that if you know the exact full size of your disk,
you'll notice when it changes. However, I don't think that many users
will notice even when the size of 360 Kb diskette gets changed from
354 to 353 Kb, let alone the larger media... :-)

Yes, indeed, that's because the virus "swallows" the error... :-)
Thans for pointing out this.

Sometimes DOS updates the second copy of the FAT itself, so this
method is unreliable. I have observed several cases in which the EOF
mark was present in both copies of the FAT. Better check whether the
hex representation of the EOF mark in the FAT is 0(F)FFEh (means
virus), or 0(F)FFFh (means normal EOF). Anyway, the virus does not use
this strange mark for self-recognition, so IMHO the strange value is
a bug un the virus code.

That's because the Dir virus is not spread in the SU... :-) Anyway,
how does Bezrukov call this virus? It's a bit difficult to apply his
notation to it...

Have you really observed such situation?! It shouldn't be possible,
according to the virus code... The virus installs itself on the last
cluster of the disk, which is not marked as bad.

Subject: DEC PathWorks and Virus propagation.

Does anyone have any experience of viruses in an environment that uses
the DEC PathWorks (PCSA) software to provide virtual disks to a number
of PCs?  The environment is:-
                    DEC VAX/VMS 5.4 on a VAX 6410
                    DECNET over thinwire Ethernet.
                    PC-DOS3.3 and 4.01 on approx 45 PCs.

In particular, my interest is in whether a virus such as 1701 or 1704
can 'take up residence' on a virtual-disk on the VAX/VMS system. If it
does take up residence, how would i go about removing it?  One of the
networked PCs has been caught with 1701 and i need to know if the rest
of the PCs are going to get it too.  Somehow, i suspect that the
subtle differences in filestore structure between DOS and VMS will
prevent such a problem; can someone confirm or deny my assumption?

DEC have, so far, been somewhat reluctant to give me a definitive answer.

I'd also like to know how and why do all these viruses get exported so
easily.  Is Bulgaria such an important source of software ? Do the
virus writers have accomplices who export infected programs ?

Subject: STONED Virus - information please! (PC)

Hello!

Well, here at work we've finally got our first virus, the STONED virus.

We are using McAfee v82 to scan and clean the infected disks.  But I
have some questions:

1) How does the STONED virus propagate itself?  If it is just on the
boot sector of a data disk and I access that disk via a program from a
"clean" system, will it propagate?  Seems to me that the STONED virus
must be running in memory to be able to propagate

2) It seems that if I copy files from a STONED disk to a non-infected
disk, the virus is not transmitted to the clean disk (assuming the
system I run the COPY from is clean in the 1st place).  Is this always
true?

3) On some occassions when using McAfee's CLEAN 82 on a floppy that
SCAN 82 discovered STONED on, CLEAN says it cleaned the disk but
another SCAN still says STONED is there.  Note that the PC has been
cleaned of the virus.  Is this perhaps just an image or signature left
behind and that the virus really has been removed?

4) Can McAfee SCAN 82 make mistakes?  One office seems to have had all
of their floppies infected, even those that haven't been used in
awhile.  The PC we checked the disks from registers clean (we always
power down and boot from a known good disk to run SCAN from).  Is
McAfee providing false information or are the disks really infected
(and the virus has been lying "dormant")?

That's enough for now - I'll be checking the FTP sites for
virus-related info.

Thanks in advance for any info that can be provided.

Dave

I had a VERY similar problem.  Are you by chance using QEMM?  If so,
remove "ROM" from the command line in your config.sys and see if the
problem goes away -- did for me!

The next step would be to try a known good controller - either put it
in the suspect box, or put the suspect floppies in a known good box...

Subject: "Better DOS than DOS" and viri (OS/2) (PC)

Does anyone have a reading on how MS-DOS viri will behave for DOS
programs run under OS/2 2.0?  I would guess that the better OS/2 is at
emulating DOS, the better such viri will do.  I'd hope it might stop
some of them, however.

In conjunction, how will anti-viral programs now commonly used under
DOS fare at protecting OS/2 machines?  For example, the "device
driver" monitoring programs that many of us run - will it be possible
to get OS/2 to use those "drivers" to check the DOS programs we run
under OS/2?  (I'm guessing it will.)

Subject: Re: DIR II (Cluster) Virus (PC)

Greetings,
    Add Greece to the sightings of this virus...

    Anyhow, a few minor additions...  This virus actually *DOES* use
a particular mostly-undocumented interrupt.  It does not call the
interrupt directly, but rather uses the location to determine the location
of the 'real' INT 21h.  (As far as I can tell, that is.  I'm sure Joe Wells
knows more than I about that subject.)

    The next version of CLEAN will remove the DIR II virus.  (Tentatively V84)
It was interesting...  I was told at first that some people felt it couldn't
be done within the methods that our program uses.  Well, it may not be as
blazingly fast as some of my other removers, but it will remove the virus
successfully.  (I haven't had a problem yet, but it's still in Beta...)
It's not slow, either.

    The hope around the block these days is that we can stop this puppy
before it spreads too far.  (I'll admit, I'm just hoping it doesn't make
it into the USA.  As soon as it does, all hell is going to break loose if
only a few anti-virus products are working against it.)

Yes, but the question to ask is, "Would more viruses had appeared on
the scene *even if* scanners had not?"  My inclination is to believe
they would.  Look at the Mac world.  Scanners/Disinfectors have appeared
on this platform, but the number (read: strains, variants, and new kinds)
of viruses (not infection count) has not increased with the voracity
that the PC world has experienced.

I disagree.  Even hardware solutions can be overcome by the ignorant
or impatient.  The most effective of solutions comes with a combination
of hardware and software.  Software alone cannot stop viruses altogether.
Nor can hardware alone (See Star Trek, the Next Generation, there was
an interesting episode a while back about the Enterprise becoming
"infected"...if I recall correctly, it was because of "mites"...little
hardware creatures that had gotten into the ship's systems.  Granted,
a little far feteched by today's standards, but who's to say that there
won't come a day when we can create (or encounter) infectious "beings"?)

There is no ultimate solution to the problem, but there are reasonable
approaches, both hardware and software.  (See Padgett Peterson's
paper on the six-byte integrity checking, and some of the programs he
and others have written, as well as his recent "Interesting Laptop
Configuration" posting).

I agree with Dave, here.  What's the use of having a computer if you
can't share data?  Answer:  There is none.  100% security = 100%
non productivity.  You might as well power it down, lock it in a
lead safe, cast it in cement, and drop it to the bottom of a shark-
infested sea (cf. Gene Spafford), and we're back in the forties.

Yes, but the Apple OS is still *software*, isn't it.  For that matter,
so is MVS and VM, and we see very few mainframe viruses, too.

points over and over again.  I for one, am growing tired of paging
through mounds of postings with nothing new to say.  The simple fact is
viruses are here, they're not going to stop until the writers decide to
stop writing them, and I think that *anything* that can be done to
slow them down, even a little bit, is useful.

General Description:

Virus Buster offers a very wide variety of antiviral protection,
and is suitable for both novice and experienced users.  BUSTER and
WATCHDOG/PROTECT are non-resident and resident change detection
software, respectively.  In addition, WATCHDOG provides activity
monitoring and operation restriction.  FIDO/Phideaux allows
WATCHDOG to run under Windows.  DOCTOR and VBSHIELD provide non-
resident and resident signature scanning.  DISKLOK provides access
restriction to the hard disk and detection/disinfection of boot
sector viri: KEYLOK restricts access to the computer if left
unattended.  VBCOPY checks files for viral signatures during copy
operations.  VBSAVER provides other Virus Buster programs with the
ability to detect stealth viri.  A file browser, LIST, and a task
scheduler, ONCEADAY, are also included.

                  Comparison of features and specifications



User Friendliness

Installation

The package is shipped on dual media.  The 360K disks are non-
writable, the 720K disk is writable, but protected.

The manual is dauntingly thick, but the first page provides
information on installation, and clearly outlines the "Standard"
and "Default" methods for installation.

Installation is quite intelligent.  Time to install will vary
greatly depending upon the options chosen.  As is indicated in the
manual, default installation can be quite lengthy.

Ease of use

Most of the programs run with a mouse sensitive menuing interface,
but there is also an option to use command line switches for those,
more familiar with the system, who wish faster and more direct
control.

Menu and mouse use is well explained in the manual, and should
present no difficulty to anyone.  It is, however, not quite
standard for those used to a CUA interface.

Help systems

A number of help systems are available, and help for menu items is
context sensitive.  It is, however, fairly brief in most cases.

A very nice feature is the fact that some characteristic
information is given about any virus detected, rather than merely
a name.

Compatibility

The programs appear to be well behaved.  Provision has been made
for the WATCHDOG TSR to work under Windows.

The PROTECT program is one which adds information to program files
in order to detect any changes made to the files.  As has been
noted with other, similar, programs in the past, this practice may
conflict with programs which already have internal self checks.
However, a number of such programs, modified by PROTECT, showed no
problem in subsequent runs.

Company Stability

The company has apparently enjoyed sufficient success as to open an
office in the United States this year.

Company Support

The documentation lists numbers for voice, fax and BBS in
Australia, and the manual stresses the use of the BBS for support.
A small window in the lower right hand corner of the screen
continually scrolls through the phone and fax numbers for the North
American office (which I received my copy from), as well as the
serial number: a nice feature when calling for support.

Documentation

Although the printed documentation is the size of a significant
novel, the arrangement of the material is thoughtful and well
presented.  Chapter 1 is a single page, which explains how to
install the program.  Subsequent chapters explain: how the manual
works, how the program works, how the interface works, how
installation works and so forth.  (If I may be permitted a small
"peeve", the typeface is awful.)  Much information is duplicated in
many chapters as many of the programs have common options.

Chapter 18 is a good description of the virus situation - with the
one proviso that it overemphasizes the value of "buy only
commercial" as a defence against viri.  The statement that "no
professional software house releases virii ..." may be
syntactically correct, but is misleading in terms of the actual
safety of commercial software.

(Although I had received version 3.75 of the software by the time
this review was complete, I had not yet received the latest version
of the documentation.)

Hardware Requirements

None stated.

Performance

The DOCTOR scanning program is fairly slow in terms of the current
generation of scanners.  It also "triggered" falsely on a number of
other antiviral programs, although it did not give any false
postitives on 80 meg worth of other software.  Although it was able
to find the BRAIN and Stoned viri on disk, it was unable to find
them in memory.  Stoned was removed from the hard disk with no
problems, but remained active and infectious.

The description of VBSAVER's operation is very short, although
perhaps understandably so in view of the battle for security
technology between virus writers and antiviral developers.  The
documentation seems to imply that VBSAVER is ineffective until
invoked, and in tests it was unable to assist in identification of
stealth boot viri, although the DOCTOR program did state that a
stealth virus might be operating, and recommended rebooting.

DISKLOK is unusual among hard disk access restriction programs in
that it stores copies of the original system areas and restores
them if any change is detected, thus defeating most boot sector
viri including Stoned.  DISKLOK can be bypassed, but the manual is
quite clear about possible dangers and what to do about them.

WATCHDOG was effective in preventing writing to disks during
testing.  Any attempt to write to a protected area generates an
alert window.  The menu allows the user to allow or disallow the
operation, and, optionally, provides information on the action
detected.

Local Support

None provided.

Support Requirements

Virus Buster can be almost fully utilized by a novice user.  Expert
help in installation should provide a very high level of
protection.

                                 General Notes

Virus Buster provides one of the most complete defences against
viral attack yet reviewed, ranking with pre version 2.00 FPROT in
the range of protection provided.  The help systems, interface and
manual should allow it to provide a high level of protection to
even naive users.  A weakness in the area of detection of memory
resident viral programs should be addressed, but the combination of
defences does not seriously weaken the overall protection delivered
by the package.
