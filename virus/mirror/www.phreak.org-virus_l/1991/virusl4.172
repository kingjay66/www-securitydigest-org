COLUMBUS, OHIO, U.S.A., 1991 SEP 20 (NB) -- Noel Bonczoszek
of Scotland Yard, acting on a tip from a London-based virus
expert, has notified CompuServe that one of the infected files in
a library of the VIRUSFORUM was downloaded by someone in London.
The file, MOUSE.COM, was on the forum from September 9 through 18
and during that time was downloaded nine times, but, according to
John McAfee, whose company operates the forum, it was only copied
by people who were virus specialists.

According to Mr. McAfee, who, on behalf of his company, accepts
complete responsibility, the library was created as a place that
users could upload suspected files to be checked for possible
virus infection by the forum's sysop, Aryeh Goretsky 76702,1714,
manager of the technical support department for McAfee
Associates. Because of a misunderstanding of how CompuServe
libraries are managed by the system software, Mcafee Associates
was, according to Mr. McAfee, unaware that it was possible to
also download an infected file stored in the forum.

Mr. McAfee told Newsbytes that his company's own BBS did not
permit downloading of such files and they just weren't aware that
it could be done on CompuServe, but he emphasized that the error
was entirely on their part and not due to any problem or mistake
on the part of CompuServe itself.

Mr. McAfee said that, despite the offer to aid any of the nine
people who downloaded the file, only one woman contacted the
sysop and she actually apologized for downloading what she knew
was an infected file. He reported that she had done it to
experiment with the virus and had taken precautions not to infect
her system; thus, she had suffered no damage.

Two virus experts known to this bureau also downloaded the file
to check it and their systems were likewise not in any way
infected.

One of those experts contacted Scotland Yard, which immediately
contacted CompuServe to block further spread of the virus.

The following is the statement now being carried on the
CompuServe VIRUSFORUM:

"IMPORTANT NOTE - PLEASE READ

"On September 18, it was discovered that a file uploaded to the
suspect file area of the Compuserve Virus Forum had been
accidentally unlocked and made available for downloading from the
suspected file area. The file, MOUSE.COM, was uploaded by user
73750,2417 for analysis as a suspected infected file. It
contained the Taiwan 4 virus and it clearly identified itself as
containing a suspected virus during a download. Our records
indicate that nine people downloaded the infected file before the
oversight was noticed and corrected.

"While the library area containing this file clearly indicated
that the enclosed files were suspect and that the library should
be used for uploads only, we must assume that one or more of the
downloaders may have downloaded in error and are unaware of the
potential danger. Accordingly, we are urging all 9 people who
downloaded this file to contact McAfee Associates for
instructions or assistance.

As a result of this error, we have decided to close down Library
#0, the Suspect Virus upload library. Forum users may continue to
submit suspected viruses for review through Compuserve Mail to
Aryeh Goretsky (76702,1714) or Spencer Clark (76702,1713). This
change will prevent this error from recurring. We regret any
inconvenience caused by closing Library 0, and we further regret
that anyone may have downloaded the infected file in error. For
assistance or further questions, please contact McAfee Associates
at (408) 988-3832 during office hours, or send email to the
SysOps."

End quote from Aryeh Goretsky 76702,1714 (his e-mail CompuServe
address).

Asked if his anti-virus software would have caught the infected
program when it was eventually scanned, Mr. McAfee told
Newsbytes, "Our scan program would have detected it and our clean
program would have removed it. It is a very common virus." Mr.
McAfee also said that the virus only attacks the AUTOCAD.EXE
file.

Another virus expert said that, while he hadn't completely
analyzed the file yet, it appeared to be full of obscenities and
that in its original form it was probably portrayed to
unsuspecting potential users as an enhanced Logitech mouse
driver.

There is absolutely no indication that this virus-infected
program could have infected any other CompuServe files, and a
computer security specialist not connected with CompuServe or
McAfee Associates has pointed out that by the nature of the file
it could only infect an MS-DOS system anyway and that there is no
logical way CompuServe's operating environment could have
activated the virus.

Although Mr. McAfee doesn't report, and may not know, just how
the infected file was originally discovered to be downloadable,
Newsbytes has learned that it was discovered by one of Mr. McAfee's
competitors who passed along the word, and Mr. McAfee and
CompuServe were first made aware of the problem by Scotland Yard.

Mr. McAfee does credit Scotland Yard's Noel Bonczoszek with being
the one who brought the problem to his attention.

Look for things that are Control Panel devices (like Soundmaster) but
are renamed.

Look for folder(s) with sounds in them (you probably did this already).

Get info on everything in the System Folder (with ResEdit 1.3 cuz it's
handier) and note everything that is an init.  Something with an
innocent name might be making naughty noises.

Check the Sound cdev in the control panel and see what is listed as
it's sound.

Lastly, using ResEdit 2.1 or 2.1.1 if System 7, open the System folder
and actually play all the sounds in there.  It'll be obvious what are
sound resources.

Virus?  Doubtful tho possible.  If you have a question about what I said
(or don't know how to get the latest ResEdit) send mail.

Anyone else getting "Error reading drive C" when using this combo. We
are using the new version of FPROT 2.00. Works with 286 just fine,
works with other systems fine...but not with any of the 386 guys.

Oh, I see that this is a problem:

Subject: Boot variations

                             Boot variations

There are some interesting variations in the boot process which can have
implications for security.

On pre-System 7 Macintosh computers, each floppy disk that was inserted
in the computer was "booted", in a sense.  The "Desktop" information, and
the description of how it would appear on the screen was in program
format, and so any program identified as WDEF would run automatically.
This was used quite successfully by one Mac virus.

The Atari computer may reserve up to six sectors for the "boot sector":
only one is ever used in the normal course of events.  This, of course,
provides an excellent "hiding place" for a virus.  The additional five
sectors can contain a reasonably capable virus, and there is no danger of
overwriting, or any need to try to avoid detection in changing file
sizes.

In terms of hiding places, the variations in the size of system areas and
tables has caused some viral programs to be unintentionally destructive.
Stoned, for example, places the original boot sector "out of harms way"
in a sector which, on a normal 360K disk, was generally redundant.  That
area would only be used if more than 95 files were placed on the disk; a
highly unlikely occurrence.  With high density disks, however, that
section of the disk is more important to the file allocation table,
leading to the loss of access to dat on some diskettes.  A similar
situation occurred with hard disks.

On MS-DOS computers with extended partitioning of the hard disk, the
master boot record may be read while accessing a different drive.  It is
therefore possible to become infected with a virus which takes over the
MBR even if the computer is booted from a floppy disk.

Zenith computes have always had a fairly distinctive boot sequence.
Latterly, Zenith BIOS will allow you to specify whether the computer is
to be booted from the floppy or the hard disk, and which disk.  This is
a handy safety feature (and equally handy for virus research.)  Formerly,
however, Zenith computers, among others, would change the boot sector on
every startup.  This was sometimes used as a pseudo "clock backup".  The
fact that the boot sector was changing at all times, however, conflicted
with change detection software which checked the boot sector.

General Description:

Control Room provides extensive management of a wide variety of
system parameters, with thorough explanation of all aspects so as
to be suitable for even the most naive users.  Although such
systems are available to provide system informaton for
experienced users, Control Room is unique in the amount of
assistance given to the average user.

Virus checking is intended to be automated at run time, and is
restricted to file image checking.

                   Comparison of features and specifications



User Friendliness

Installation

The product is shipped on unprotected diskettes.  The
distribution files appear to be self-extracting archives.  The
security risks involved in this practice have been discussed
extensively on VIRUS-L.

The installation process is quick, clear and well thought out.
The program is well prompted, and will install "from" anywhere
"to" anywhere.  The only change made to system files is the
addition of one line to the AUTOEXEC.BAT.  This change is
optional, and can be made automatically at a later date.  The
implications of not allowing the program to make th change are
clearly stated.

Changes made to the system often wait for the next "reboot" to
become effective.

Additions of files to be added to the virus checking list
requires that the user know the names of program or susceptible
files on the system.  Addition of files after installation is
easy enough with a text editor, but must be done manually.

Ease of use

The program is extremely easy to use, with menus, mouse support
and context sensitive help.

Virus protection is a bit hard to find, being "buried" under the
"general" menu.  For those used to more "active" antiviral
systems, it will appear quite passive.

Help systems

Help is available for all menus, screens and fields, as well as a
"searchable" index.

Compatibility

As is appropriate for a "system information" package, the program
does not appear to conflict with any ardware tested.

In terms of virus protection, the program appears only to check
for file infecting viri at boot time.  Boot sectors and memory
are not checked.

Company Stability

Ashton-Tate is well established.

Company Support

Support is provided for a number of products, and a standard
"Support and Services Guide" is included with all Ashton-Tate
products.  Unfortunately, support for Control Room itself seems
quite limited.

Documentation

The documentation is very brief, and not particularly clear in
regard to the operation of the program.

Hardware Requirements

384K minimum, DOS 3.x or higher and at least two drives.

Performance

Virus detection is limited to file "image" checking at boot time.
This would appear to limit detection to file infectors.  Since
the check is run at boot time, it may catch "stealth" infectors
which have not yet been invoked.  However, the check is run at
the beginning (by default) of the AUTOEXEC.BAT, and so may be
affected by programs run in the CONFIG.SYS, or by an infection of
COMMAND.COM.  Boot sector infectors are not detected.

The fact that the check is run at boot time makes its operation
automatic, but the lack of opportunity to run at other times
limits the possibility of checking "suspect" programs, or of
catching an infection before it has spread too far.

Since the detection is limited to file image changes, it will
"trigger" on programs which make changes to themselves, such as
WordPerfect, Muse or SETVER.

The alert that is given, when a change is found, is quite mild,
and offers to option to "recertify" the file.  It is very similar
to the notice that a new file has been added to the list.

Local Support

Ashton-Tate maintains offices in most major centres.

Support Requirements

Since the virus protection is only detection, removal of the
virus will require expert intervention.  (It should be noted that
the program does have a "Wipe Out" file overwrite deletion
capability.)

                                 General Notes

Control Room is not intended primarily as an antiviral package,
and is reviewed for completeness sake because of its virus
protection claims.  Personally, as one involved in technical
support, I wish all my clients had it, so as to be able to answer
my questions about the state of their machinery!
