Subject: Problem with virus checker (PC)

A friend of mine is using the McAfee virus scan program on his computer.
 When
he attempts to run the program, however, the program does not run.  As soon
as
the line with the phone number comes up, some funny characters come onto the
screen and then the c: prompt reappears.  Whenever he puts a clean disk into
 the computer, the disk, when scanned on another machine, the stoned virus
is
on the disk.  Does anyone have an answer to this problem?

Thanks,
Brian J. Peretti

PLASTIQUE-2900 VIRUS


The Plastique Virus is Parasitic on COM & EXE files but excludes
COMMAND.COM.  The infection method is slightly unusual in that
COM files have the virus code prepended to the file, while EXE
files have it appended.  In either case, the infective length is
2900 bytes and no stealth capabilities exist to mask this
increase in file length.  After infection, file attributes and
date/time settings are partially encrypted but allows the
extraction of a recognition string.

This virus becomes resident in high memory by using the DOS
Terminate and Stay Resident function 31H.  During installation a
timing routine determines the processing speed and this is used
for sound effects later.

As it becomes resident, INT 21H is intercepted by a special
handler which will cause file infection on function requests
4B00H & 3D00H, these correspond to Load & Execute, and Open File
for Read Only.  The DOS Critical Error handler (INT 24H) is
bypassed during the infective cycle to avoid error messages.

On a random basis, virus installation after 20th Sept. 1990 may
cause other handlers to be installed which will produce certain
sound effects and may result in execution of the trigger
routine.
These handlers are as follows:-
One of two INT 08 - Timer Interrupt handlers are installed
(chances are even of either one being installed).

Handler 1 increments the timer counter and slows processing
progressively up to a limit decided during installation timing.

Handler 2 also increments the timer counter and makes "explosion"
noise about every 4.5 minutes.

An INT 09 - Keyboard Interrupt handler is installed which will
intercept a Ctrl-Alt-Del key sequence and then act according to
which INT 08 handler is installed.  If Handler 1 is present then
the trigger routine is activated.  If Handler 2 is present then
Non-volatile RAM is overwritten with OFFH bytes.  The INT 09
handler also counts keypresses, and after 4000 keypresses, an
error will be forced on the next disk write request to INT 13H.

An INT 13H - Disk Access handler is installed which intercepts
write requests and forces an error according to the condition of
a flag.  The error consists of putting -1 into DX (Head & Drive)
and completing the call.  The routine then returns without
setting the relevant flags so that the caller is not aware that
his data has NOT been written.

The Trigger routine occurs immediately on execution of ACAD.EXE,
otherwise during a Ctrl-Alt-Del sequence from within INT 09
handler if INT 08 Handler 1 is installed and the timer counter
has reached a predetermined limit.  The actual routine checks if
there is a floppy disk in drive A:, if so it overwrites head 0 of
all tracks with the contents of memory from address 0000:0000.
Processing continues similarly for floppy in drive B:, zapping it
if possible.  Then the "explosion" routine is set to occur as
both the first and second fixed disk drives are overwritten on
all heads and tracks.  Finally a loop overwrites the contents of
CMOS by direct port access.

The virus recognises itself in memory by issuing an INT 21H with
4B40H in the AX register.  If the virus is resident, the call
returns with 5678H in AX.  Recognition on disk is by examining
the word at offset 12H in the target file.  If this word is 1989H
then the file is assumed to be infected.

The recognition string for the Plastique virus is as follows :-

        B840 4BCD 213D 7856 7512 B841 4BBF 0001

and this will be found at offset 82CH into the virus code.

I currently run Disinfectant 2.4 and Virex 2.84.  I have run both
products for about a year and a half.  I can't tell you what the first
release was of each which I ran.  Both John Norstadt (Disinfectant)
and Microcom (Virex) do an excellent job of providing updates soon
after we seen reports of new viruses.  Virex meets my needs, and I run
Disinfectant because I can do so for no additional cost, and a few
times Disinfectant has been first with protections against a new
virus.  In the past, John Norstadt has written well of Virex.

Hi, all...

I was "volunteered" to handle Mac "security" (read: virus protection)
here at Goddard roughly a year ago, and after some research and
consultation with a number of local gurus decided to throw in my lot
with Disinfectant.  Admittedly the primary reason was that it was FREE
(and it worked!), so there were no problems with licensing X copies.
I just wanted to add my 2 cents' worth to RD Francis' message...

>As far as I know, from the standpoint of reliability, both products
>are completely reliable.

Ditto here -- if I put a disk into a Mac with either one of these programs
(assuming Virex has been updated!), I feel confident that it's safe.

>                          The only differences visible to the user are

One other factor: in general, I find Disinfectant less "obtrusive", in
that the scan is fast and silent, and you don't have to worry about
interruptions unless you *need* one, i.e., to tell you a file's been
infected.


>                                        By commercial vs. PD, I mean

I will heartily second that!  Again, I'm not out to "plug" any product, and
I
feel equally confident about the safety of my files with either Virex OR
Disin-
fectant, but the upgrades to the latter 1) come faster, 2) are more readily
available, 3) are trustworthy, 4) THEY WORK, and 5) don't cost diddly squat
beyond your network connection (or a blank floppy if you get it from
someone).

Here at Goddard, I now distribute what's called "MacSecure" (now at vers.
3.0).
It's a single (800K) floppy containing Disinfectant (the most recent version
available, as soon as we're able to lay hands on it), a reallllly good
Hyper-
Card stack put together by Joe McMahon (one of my colleagues here) that
tells
you all kinds of good stuff about viruses, how they work, how to "kill"
them,
and reviews virus fighters, and a smaller "MacHelper" stack that I threw
together to give hints & tips and explain what some of those ugly Sad Macs
and
Mac Bombs mean...  I know that an unfortunate number of users ignore and/or
discard the HyperCard stacks, but Disinfectant continually gathers raves
from
MacSecure users -- and that now includes several NASA centers, a number of
NASA-affiliated contractors, several local computer sites... and after a
series
of VERY unexpected phone calls, the (then-known-as) Operation Desert Shield!

Again, Virex *is* good stuff -- but thank you thank you thank you John
Norstad!

Subject: Stoned virus in partition table (PC)

I work in the CS Student Lab at UT Austin.  Doing a routine check on
the IBM compatibles, I found the Stoned virus on the partition table.
This sounds harmless enough, but this virus is VERY much stuck there.
I've done a low- level format, high-level format, and repartitioned
the disk, and Stoned is still there.  Someone at the lab suggested
using a Norton utility called ZeroDisk; unfortunately we don't have a
copy of Norton Utilities available in the lab.  Anybody have any
ideas?  E-Mail or postings would be appreciated.

Subject: Mac virii & System 7.0 (Mac)

     I hope this hasn't been discussed already, but I'm curious about
the net world's thoughts about what will happen to all the viruses (Virii)
we know and hate when system 7.0 comes out (in the first quarter of 1991?)

     I had a couple of thoughts (based on no evidence whatsoever) of what
might happen, ranging from the hopeful to the nightmarish.  If anyone
(like anti-virus authors?) has been playing with 7.0 beta versions and
viruses,
I think the net world would be interested in your wisdom.

(Wishful thinking) System 7 will be so different that existing viruses
will not be able to spread, but neither will they cause any problems at all.

The current crop of viruses (excepting WDEF) will not spread, because they
will immediately cause infected applications to crash.

Viruses will spread, but will frequently cause System 7 to crash.

     Obviously, I've simplified things a bit (mainly because I am not a mac
guru by any means), but I still think that the subject is one we should
worry
about after we finish worrying about _when_ system 7 comes along.

Subject: New virus 1586? (PC)

Hello,

        I'm new to this group and I'm not familiar with the protocols in
anouncing the discovery(sic.) of a new virus...but here goes anyway.

Virus attributes:
        1. IBM pc/xt/at/ps2
        2. Changes files date/time.
        3. Changes files size.
                filename        noVir           Vir     Difference
                command.com     37637           39223   1586
                simcity.exe    191845          193431   1586
                share.exe       10301           11879   1578
        4. Hooks to following interupts:
                22H     Terminate     xxxx:0147
                24H     Critical err  xxxx:05Bf
                2EH     Execute cmd   xxxx:02B8
                FFH     User def.     0002:F000
        5. Due to the interupts it attaches to during any program
                termination, disk error, or DOS command the virus
                finds the first *.com or *.exe file in the directory
                not attacked and ataches itself and also checks to see
                if it's active in memory if not it installs itself.
        6. Attaches to .com and .exe (.bin not tested)
        7. Can be identified in executables with following hex codes.
                0E B0 00 E6 20 B8 24 35 CD 21  (taken from virus)
If someone (reputable [ie. has written vir.pro. programs before]) would like
to tackle this hobbie of killing and detection of this virus I'll send you a
copy.

Better yet if someone has alread done so TELL ME WHERE TO FIND IT.  I'm
desperate for a solution; deletion is (to me) not a good solution.

The Stoned virus is definitely common in the States; but
the "Stoned 2" (a variant, not identical to the Stoned)
has only been seen in Australia/New Zealand.  The
various U.S. "Stoned 2" reports that we heard awhile back
all, as far as I know, turned out to be due to the
signature confusion that I mentioned earlier: some
scanners would report the "Stoned 2" when scanning
a disk with the usual Stoned virus on it.           DC

I hope it doesn't use checksumming. I find that checksumming adds time to

Well, I can't help you with the RED DIAVOLYATA, aside from the rather
obvious point that it seems to be the "name" of the author.

This, however, is rather interesting.  "Eddie" is the name of the "mascott"
of the heavy metal group, Iron Maiden.  Eddie sort of looks like a decayed,
mutilated corpse.  This becomes less of a stretch of meaning because
"Somewhere in Time" is the name of an Iron Maiden album from the early
eighties.  I guess Western heavy metal music really IS popular in Eastern
Europe.  Not to imply that people who like heavy metal are virus writers,
of course :-).  I just thought I'd point out the interesting cultural link
there.
