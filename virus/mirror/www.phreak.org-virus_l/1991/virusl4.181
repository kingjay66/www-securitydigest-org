As far as *I* know, VIRx (and the commercial VPCSCAN, part of the Virex
package) is still the only scanner to look inside of PKLITE files that
have been compressed with the "-e" (non-extractable) switch turned on.

Subject: IDE Drive Problems (PC)

I`ve discovered a very nasty problem with various IDE drives and
I'm wondering if anyone else out there has seen the same problem.

We had problems with the filesystem on an iRMX partition disk and
originally thought it was our software that was writing sectors of
0xF8's to the filesystem on the disk.  We eventually discovered the
problem was with the IDE drives during a reset.

If the controller is writing the disk and the disk receives a hardware
reset, the sector that the controller was writing is filled with 0xF8's.
The data (0xF8) was specific to the TEAC IDE drive(SD-340) and was 0xE7 for
the Connors IDE drives(CP3044, CP3084).

We duplicated the problem at work and on my machine at home using a simple
DOS program that continually writes to a specific cylinder on the drive
and pressing the system reset button.

I realize there is a small window at which time the sector being written
is not finished and may contain bad data (and a bad CRC), but I can cause
this problem 80% of the time.  I cannot get this problem to occur on MFM,
RLL, or ESDI drives.

I was wondering if anyone out there has seem this problem at all and maybe
thought that a virus infected their system and caused 0xF8 (or 0xE7) to
be written on the disk.

I would be most appreciative of any feedback.

Thanks !

Hello Everyone!

	First off, I owe everyone an apology. The anti-viral archives
on BEACH.GAL.UTEXAS.EDU have been less than spectacular for the past
several months. Without going into a lot of detail, the problem was
due to technical difficulties. But the situation has finnaly been
corrected! BEACH now has all of the latest popular anti-viral software
for the MSDOS and MACINTSH arenas.  The file have been updated by
yours truly to all the latest versions of everything I could find. I
invite everyone to use BEACH for all of your anti-viral needs. We're
back on the air!

 Naturally, this virus handles disk(s) device(s) driver(s) and then
 handle 4 functions of device drivers ---- Build BPB,Ouput,Write,Write+Ver
 In SU we have 2 anti-vir programms that cure this virus.

 It's size is 1024 (1536 in memory) in this case he allocate 1-2 last clusters
 due to disk structure

 It infects files only when somebody want to access files/directory
 Also it didn't infect files that has the small size, I checked 512,1024 and
 2048 bytes, 512 and 1024 were free

 also if you boot from the clean disk you can't copy any EXE or COM files
 to diskette because when you try you'll copy only virus body due to
 EOF in FAT (1 copy) in the last cluster


>The virus is also a stealth virus.  While it is active in memory

       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ actual size of the disk :-) but
 you can detect virus very simple via:

 1 insert protected flopyy disk to drive and try to delete files from
   it. If virus is active then you don't get any error messages
   N.B. on 3.5" disks some strange errors may be get such as
   Devide Overflow

 2 check last cluster in the 1 and 2nd copies of FAT if in first you found
   EOF but in second not than it may be thesignal that those virus is hear.

 The virus has been named in SU ( as far as it appeared here in early summer)
 as DRIVER-1024 (due to scheme of infection) or DIR but not DIR-2


 Few Tips for anti-virus developer.

 1 magic number (via files encoded) is the word at offset 33fh in virus body
   eg in last (or pre-last) cluster. Then all you have to do is
   scan via directory and on _EVERY ENTRY_ do
        ROL magic,1
   if you find COM or EXE file with some data at offset
          DIRECTORY_ENTRY_STRUCT[14h] and DIRECTORY_ENTRY_STRUCT[15h]
          (the last word in reserved area )
        then you must xor this word with the magic word before rol magic eg

              while(NotEndOfTheDirectory)
		{
		GetNextEntry
                  IF(COM || EXE)&&(LASTWORD NOT NULL)
                    {
                      /* Virus I think, but it will be better to check
			 LASTWORD means las word in the reserved area in DIR
 			 first cluster of the file for virus before correct */
		     IF(CheckCluster)
                       {
 			/* virus in cluster */
                          xor LASTWORD,MAGIC
			 PutEntry
			}
		    }
                 rol magic,1
		}

  that is simple block-scheme :-) to check and correct directory
  in every directory you have to start decoding with original magic number

  2 There were the situation when disk was infected and virus occypies not
    the last cluster and not even near. That is why I think that there may
    be situation when 2 or more copies of virus may be present on one disk

  3 There were the situation when disk was infected but the last cluster
    was empty in this situation it is possible to recover disk with analyzing
    of file size and trying to restore magic. The percent of normal
    recovering growth with the number of infected files in this directory

  4 it is better to check all files on disk with the size 1024,2048 bytes
    to check their for virus. As far as you can copy virus neither file

  5 Also it is better to correct FAT to do 1 and 2nd copy equal for a proper
    programms operation such as DiskEdit etc.

All questions are appreciated here.
Regards.

There is normally ABSOLUTELY no problem in running the program on a
'386 machine. There is a problem on one specific version of DOS -
Zenith DOS 3.30-PLUS.  If you are using that version I know of the
problem, if not I would like to hear more about your setup.

This version of DOS is able to use >32M partitions, but my program
assumed this was only true for DOS 3.31 and above.  I think I have the
problem fixed, and version 2.01 whould work without problems,

I have not been able to test it yet, however - as I have been unable to
locate a copy of Zenith DOS 3.30PLUS in Iceland.

My experience is pretty similar - I have several cases of pairs of nearly
identical viruses, where some minor changes have been made.

In some cases the changes seem to be the result of a random bit error,
as the resulting code does not "make sense".  In other cases I find an
attempt to bypass some scanner, for example if the change involves
just swapping two instructions.

The frequency of these cases is low - only around 1% of the viruses I have.
In most cases where a virus is patched to produce a new variant, the changes
are more extensive - sometimes changing the activation dates, text messages
and even the function of the virus.  These patched viruses may be 10-15% of
all viruses, but one usually just cannot determine whether some of the
changes were made to disable some specific scanners or not.

True, but you forget that many virus variants are not created by the original
author, but by someone else, who does not necessarily have access to the
source code.

Huh ?  What do you mean ? The availability of the search strings is not at
all necessary to test a scanner - you only need a large collection of
viruses, to see if the scanner generates any false negatives, and a huge
collection of "clean" software to see if you get any false positives.

I see absolutely no need for anyone but the developer of the scanner to
know which search strings are used, and I certainly don't see how they
help in "testing" the scanner.

Dear Virus-L

We have a Novell network running Netware 386 3.11 with about 160 people
currently online.  We are also using Palindrome Tape Backup System, as I was
looking through the tape backup log TNA_LOG I noticed several errors in the
format of:

WARNING: 724 Possible VIRUS! Size change in: SYS:LOGIN/LOGIN.EXE.

I have run NETSCAN and SCAN #77 on my machine and the server but nothing is
detected.  I have also run PcTools Virus Scan with the same results.

The file size has changed 956 bytes but the date and time are still the same.

Any ideas on what the problem is?  Also these other files had the same error.

CONSOLE.COM, SLIST.EXE, LOGOUT.EXE, COLDBOOT.COM, SETERROR.EXE, PSERVER.EXE.

Thanks,

I agree (very much) that we need a lot of people using (relatively)
simple protection techniques, rather than a few people using very
complicated ones, at the moment. But I must point out there are
problems in relying too heavily on write-protect tabs:

(a) Some software from suppliers (already write-protected, shrink-wrapped) has
    been found to contain viruses, that got into the system "too early",
(b) You might need to take the tab off to bring some data or a program into
    your system; as soon as you do, your system can become infected. Or the
    programs might come in via a modem or network. If you want to obtain any
    new program, you run the risk of infection; if you let someone write data
    onto one of your diskettes, it could become infected.
(c) Even if the only communication with the outside world your system has is
    to take data on diskettes, that are write-protected, to another system, if
    the write-protect hardware is faulty on that machine (a few are) then your
    diskette could become infected.

But the main problem is this: what you need more than anything else is
a write-protect tab for your hard disks. Even if there was one big
enough (:-), you would still want to take it off every so often to
upgrade software, etc.

I feel the ABSOLUTE MINIMUM protection that everyone should be using is:
(a) write-protect some system diskettes and NEVER take the tab off (glue it on!)
    after you've copied a backup system and anti-virus software onto them from
    a clean system. You may like to only ever boot from such floppies, instead
    of your hard disk, for safety, but simply having these "safe" diskettes to
    check the system every week is probably enough to curb the main viruses.
(b) if you ever let others use any of your diskettes (or you obtain one from
    someone else) run a good scanner over it as soon as possible,
(c) have a TSR program looking for viruses in boot sectors automatically
    whenever you access a diskette.
(d) Have some software or hardware protect important, unchanging areas on your
    disk. Hardware could mean having two drives, with the write-line snipped
    (and supplied via a resistor). Software includes DrDOS 5/6's password
    protection system (built-in, but not 100% water-tight) and/or DISKGARD
    (also available via anonymous ftp), and quite a number of other programs.
(e) Software or firmware to check the MBR and DOS boot sector when starting up.

All of these steps are either free or can cost as little as $1
(depending on quantity, educational/corporate pricing policies, cost
of labour, etc). All the software you need is available as shareware,
so it can be at least tried for free. (If you don't know where to
obtain any of the software, ask me)

So why don't more people make use of such anti-virus measures?? You
might like to debate whether certain things should or should not go
into the "essentials" list above, but I feel the thing to debate is
why most BIOS manufacturers didn't put tests into their ROM's years
ago, and why MicroSoft and Digital Research don't put more virus
protection into the operating systems. At least that way, the majority
of PC's might hinder rather than promote the spread of viruses. In
fact, don't just debate it, write/phone/e-mail them! Tell them they'll
be co-respondents the first time a computer operating vital medical
equipment fails through a virus and kills a patient, because their
system isn't safe enough.

Unfortunately, viruses do well because of (on the whole) apathy on the
part of computer users, and MicroSoft (sorry to single them out, well
perhaps they deserve it), have responded to that apathy with even
greater complacency. This discussion shouldn't really be a choice
simply between hardware and software; a third, much more important
component should be there: public attitudes.

Subject: DIR II Removal Information (PC)

After disassembling and analyzing the DIR II, and some excited
interchange of information with Igor at McAfee and Glen at Microcom,
here is the info needed to remove the DIR II (which Igor, Glen, and I
would like to see renamed the Cluster virus). More specifically, here
is the info needed to write a disinfector.

A disinfector should be written only by a qualified (preferable asm)
programmer and tested extensively. A test prototype using the system
below cleaned the C: and D: drives on a 40 meg quickly. The drive was
massively infected, including many sub-directories. The prototype used
logical disk reads and writes.

The virus code will be found in the last cluster on the drive. It will
occupy 2 sectors. The code is 1024 bytes.

Each directory sector is infected as a unit. The virus uses an
encryption key (stored internally and variable from infection to
infection) to xor the dir entry cluster element of files with COM or
EXE extentions. The key is rotated left 1 bit for each entry WHETHER
THE EXTENTION IS EXE, COM, OR WHATEVER.

Even though a directory may span several sectors, the internal key is
used to start each one.

To disinfect, read the virus code from the last cluster. Get the
encryption key and save it.

The key is the word at offset 33F in the virus code.

The prototype simply checked all sectors and did simple testing to
determine if it was a directory listing or not. Any other method of
finding the sectors would work as well. Once a sector is found, set a
pointer to the first entry.  Check the word at [ptr + 1Ah] for the
last cluster number. The word at location [ptr + 14] is normally 0 in
directories (unused by DOS), but here will be the original file start
cluster in encrypted form. If infection is found, get the original,
xor it with the key and put it at [ptr + 1Ah].

Rotate the key (rol  key,1) for every entry, infected or not.

Add 20h to pointer for the next listing and repeat. There will be 16
entries per sector to check. If infection was found and fixed, write
the sector back to disk. When done, overwrite the virus code.

Testing will be hard, unless you have the virus. If you don't have it,
don't bother. If you do have it and write a disinfector, let me know.

Sincerely hoping you don't have it,
