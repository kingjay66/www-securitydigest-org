Well, yeah: you're right, there.  I've been busy with Virex-PC, but it
probably *is* time for that feature to be added.

Well, it is a single user system, after all....:-)

No, I know what you mean and that you feel it should give different
"seeds" for each system.  I recall that discussion and that I felt
(and still feel!)  it's a good idea, but a tech support nightmare.

Actually, I think that very high sales figures causes inertia in a
product: I really can't simply change the functionality of FLU_SHOT+
(or of Virex-PC) without pissing off a lot of people or adding in
extra layers of backwards compatability.  There are a buynch of things
I'd love to change in each of the programs to make them far better
programs, but that would break > 75K current users of the products.

Not quite.  However, a real dog of a product that simply doesn't work
is, eventually, gonna be found out and will have zero sales volume.
So, it would be safe to say that -- after enough time has passed --
sales volume would indicate that a bunch of people are happy with the
program, and that this *may* be an indication that the product is of
high quality (Hmmm, maybe this is turning into a submission for
RISKS...)

It's tough to decide on what determines the relative quality of a
product, though: if a scanner does 500 viruses and scans your disk in
two minutes and another scanner does 600 viruses and scans your disk
in three minutes, which one is a "better" product? Does making it
pretty, with a cool/spiffy GUI make it a "better" product?

I would think that using the sales volume of a product along with
*other* factors could help to decide what products to take a look at.
But the quality *comparative* reviews are what makes a product's
quality easy to see -- and relative to boot.  It is this relativeity
that changes, making quality a moving target.

High sales figures indicates that what somebody is offering, somebody
is buying.  This must be taken into account in the equation, no?

Greetings,

Some time ago microsoft!c-rossgr@uunet.uu.net happily mumbled:

>
>Interesting phrase, "psuedo-encryption". What, exactly, does it mean?

    There aren't any viruses which use anything that could be
considered 'real' encryption (yeah, yeah, I know, 'define real'...
We'll take it to sci.philosophy.meta, okay?)  However, what I meant by
'psuedo-encryption' is a situation in which the METHOD is different
each time.  For example, the Tequila uses XOR *OR* ADDitive
encryption.  This is more than one form of encryption, so in referring
to the entire group I call it psuedo-encryption.  The same with the
Whale, etc.  It could also be called variable encryption if you wish.

    Odd that you would claim that...  I could have sworn...  Oh, never
mind.  Actually, if you are using five bytes to search for the virus,
and someone else is using 15 (interspersed with a few wildcards), is
it automatically to be assumed that the wildcarded one is going to be
less specific?  Do you have any statistics behind it?
    The most important thing is the person putting together a string.
One has to realize that if one is going to use wildcards, one has to
use more bytes to detect than one normally would.  (For verification
purposes.)
    There is also a second trick, used by some.  When the file is
detected as almost certainly being a virus, the decryption method is
used on a portion of the file.  That portion is compared against a
standard, known block of code.  If a match ISN'T made, the file is
ignored.

    Nope.  The major reason the Stoned spreads is two-fold.  1) It's
been around for a LONG LONG time.  However, the Brain has been around
just as long, so that can't be all of it.  2) It infects HD's.  When
it *HAS* infected an HD, it infects every single disk that passes
through it.  THAT is what makes it such a successful virus.  The Brain
didn't infect HD's, and is now reduced greatly in population.
(Interestingly, though, I feel sure that there are more people
infected with the Brain than are reported, since it *IS* the first
stealth virus, and does a good job of hiding.)

>> Without a continual influx of successful viruses, that is new
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    I'd put 'successful' viruses at about one every month or so, recently.
    Those are viruses which were spread by someone with a knowledge of
    the dynamics of spreading these things.  The kind of virus that hits
    a few thousand people in the first few weeks of it's life.  A large
    percentage of those people aren't going to realize it's there.  They'll
    be the 'typhoid PC' in that area, spreading it more and more.  It also
    includes new viruses being spread by companies shipping software or
    hardware.  ('getting lucky' in some folks terms.)  These are viruses
    that the marketplace can expect to live with, because they weren't
    caught early enough to nip their spread.

    A very important point.  I hope one day to put myself out of this
crazy business, and write a book about the insanity all over the
field.
    Goodness, the personality conflicts alone would make for an
wonderful novel, then we add in the hysterics of the commercial side
of the business...  Of course, a fictional bar scene with all the
principal players would be...frightening.  I picture these ten people
suddenly realizing who else is at the bar, and the temperature
dropping twenty to thirty degrees suddenly.  *grin* Other patrons
diving for cover, and huddling behind tables suddenly.  Yupyup...  For
an industry this size, there's been a lot of backstabbing and
slandering, etc.
    If people could RELAX it would be good.  'Course there's money in
them thar PC's, and that changes some folks.

    Anyone care to make guesses on how long the Virus problem will be
around?  I'm still looking forward to writing that book.  *grin*

    (A side and sad note...  It is not us, the anti-viral researchers,
who will kill the viruses once and for all.  It's the OS writers who
will finally produce an OS which supports the protections a machine
needs.  It's the users who will finally leave this damned MS/DOS
troublemaker behind.  THAT is when viruses will vanish, slowly but
surely, and then we can all have a beer together and laugh about the
nonsense of having to clean up behind Microsoft.)

Subject: Re: A question regarding commercial dial-up services

In a recent VIRUS-L posting, lev@suned1.Nswses.Navy.Mil (Lloyd E
Vancil) refers to a recent tempest in a teapot about the cache file
used by Prodigy and asks:

  Would it be possible;
        1. for a memory resident virus to be scooped up by this service..
           and return to reinfect the machine at a later date?  Presumably
           by the service's reusing of the file fragment that contains the
           "screen primitive" and the "scooped" virus code.
        2. for a virus to be written to take advantage of this transmission
           method?

My understanding of this situation is that in order to cache TeleTex
screens, the Prodigy service allocates about a meg of disk space and
writes screens to it for later recall. Since the space is never erased
(for performance reasons), it still contains remnants of old files
that previously occupied the space. As far as I know, these remnants
are never read from disk, much less transmitted back to the host.
Somebody with a file viewer peered into this cache area one day and
imagined that the software had gone to other files and "scooped up"
their contents for some nefarious purpose.

It is possible that the area allocated to STAGE.DAT might have
previously contained an infected file, but since it should never be
read before it has been written over there can be no question of it
providing any sort of reservoir of infection.

The answer, then, must be NO to both questions.

Subject: NVM's.

Hello people;

I noticed some concern and confusion about E/EEPROMS on the Virus-l
list lately, and, since I work at Intel's NVM development fab, I
figured the least I could do was to clear things up a bit.  Some of
this is pretty pedestrian stuff, so you can skip to the end if you
want...

Definitions/explanations:
NVMs    - Non-Volatile Memories.  ROMS, PROMS,EPROMS,EEPROMS, ferromagnetic
          DRAM's, etc.  Memory storage devices that don't lose data when the
          power goes out.

fab     - Short for Fabrication.  Place where silicon wafers are turned into
          semiconductor devices.  Very clean, very very expensive factory.

ROMs    - Also called mask ROMs.  Read Only Memories.  Programming is done
          during manufacture.  "Cheapest" memory for high volume use on static
          designs.  Minimum order might be several-to-tens of thousand parts.
          Real peanut parts, these may only cost pennies apiece.

PROM    - Programmable Read Only Memory.  These babies you program once.
          Heard the term "burn in a PROM"?  Very literal saying.  To program
          them, you actually fuse the innards into the configuration you want.
          Inexpensive unless you make lots of mistakes, 'cause they are either
          right or they are scrap.

EPROM   - Also called UV EPROM's.  Invented by Intel 'way back inna '70's.  An
          Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory.  They are programmed
          electronically, and erased with ultraviolet light.  They've got a
          little transparent window in the package just for that purpose (it's
          usually covered up with a sticker or something, though; even
          ambient light WILL eventually wipe them out...note also that if the
          package doesn't have a window then your EPROM is effectively a PROM.
          Lots of these are used in automobile engine controllers, bios chips,
          etc.  Also pretty cheap, available commercially in densities up to
          4mbit or so.

EEPROM  - Also called E2PROMS.  These are Electronically Erasable Programmable
          Read Only Memories.  You don't need UV to erase them.  However, you
          do generally need at least 11 volts on one of the pins to erase/
          program them.  More on this later.  More expensive than EPROMS, but
          still cheap in all but the largest sizes.  Should replace EPROMs in
          most applications in the next few years, and may even take a big
          chunk out of the disk drive and DRAM markets.

Flash   - The hot rods of EEPROMs, also invented by Intel (of course. ~8^) )
          They program and erase quickly and have fast access times. These are
          available in either bulk (entire bank or chip) or sector (single byte)
          erase versions.  Their lifetime is measured in program/erase cycles.
          Some parts have lifetimes as low as 1000 erase/program cycles; these
          are useful for some applications that don't require many changes, but
          aren't any good for solid state disks or memory cards, for example.
          Other types have program/erase lifetimes of 100K+ cycles. (guess who
          makes those... ~8^) )  Right now there are many different
          manufacturers who make or plan to make Flash E2PROMS, including the
          market leader Intel, AMD, Seeq Technologies, Atmel, NEC, Hitachi,
          Toshiba, Oki, Mitsubishi, and maybe a couple others I missed.

Here's a shameless plug for the company that signs my paychecks, and
what seems to have caused the concern in the virus community.

Intel has just recently introduced the 1mbit 28F001BX Flash.  It's
designed for use in PC operating system software and embedded control
applications.  Features include a security-protected 8kb block on the
chip to boot applications, 2 4kb parameter blocks for configuration
info, a 112kb main memory block, 150 ns access time and single byte
erase.  It's available in PDIP or PLCC (plastic dual inline package or
plastic leaded chip carrier, I think...I just do wafers, not
packaging) and costs $17.20 in quantities of 1000. What does
security-protected mean?  Good question.  I'll see if I can find out.

Here's my own $.02: unless a really clever virus finds a way to shove
a sun lamp into your PC, you have nothing to worry about with EPROMs.
As for EEPROMs and Flash chips, they look just like PROMs or EPROMs to
your system.  Unless your system is specially configured to reprogram
them (remember that pin I mentioned earlier?) there is nothing ANY
program could do to change an EEPROM.  If some board maker actually
wanted to enable software modification to the BIOS EEPROM, there is no
reason that he couldn't do it; but that is a problem with the board
and manufacturer, not the chips.

Sorry so long winded.
M2.
 `-_-'
  'U`  Have a day.

DisClaimEr: I think most of the stuff above is pretty near correct,
and of course I don't speak for Intel in any official or unofficial
way.  I also didn't have anything to do with the 28F001BX, but it does
sound like a neat chip.

(wow)?  Not really *that* awesome...

This is only 1 terabyte (1000 gigabytes).  Something the PC world has
to remember is that the mainframe world is *designed* to deal with
*very* large databases.  For instance, we run a medium-large IBM
mainframe shop (1 3090 and 1 3084, maybe 90MIPS between them), and we
have 300 gigabytes of disk here - that's already 30% of that terabyte.
And we're NOWHERE near capacity - rough back-of-envelope calculations
show that a 3090 with 128 I/O channels (say 96 of them for disk, the
rest for TP and tapes and the like) and 256 mod 3390 disks per channel
(at 1.5 gigabytes a disk) can address 36 terabytes of disk storage.
Unless I dropped a decimal point someplace, you'd only need a room
about 250 by 200 feet to store this. (Yes, I know I'm over-simplifying
channel loading and similar constraints - most *real* shops with this
much disk run multiple CPU's, etc etc)

Bottom line - out in the commercial world of major banks, stock
brokerages, insurance houses, airline reservation systems, and other
large corporations, a mere terabyte of disk isn't considered all that
much.

Subject: Quality vs. sales

High sales volume = high quality (Totally bogus formula).  Just
because a product gets the blessing of the buying masses, not
necessarily a majority concensus, doesn't mean a product is of high
quality.  Look at the pet rock.  Alot of people bought them.  Take any
word processor.  Whatever is the best seller today, wasn't always.
When "the other word processor (fill in a name of one you like) was
the most popular, was it of better quality?  What about the Next
computer, good quality but not a high volume seller.  Once a product
becomes popular, no matter how good the competition, it becomes the
standard.  Marketing is a good portion of how well a product sells.

a) price seems to have nothing to do with software quality unless you count
   documentation - its prettier with the high-priced ones.
b) no complete package starts at the BIOS level yet therefore I don't give
   any a passing grade. (quantum economics).

See above, a vital element in a good integrity management system, but not the
only element.

Subject: Question About Stealth Viruses

>From:    "Robert McClenon" <76476.337@CompuServe.COM>

"STEALTH" is a buzzword used to denote any virus that attempts to hide itself
from observation by intecepting calls that might be used to detect the virus
and instead provides returns indicative of a clean system.

The first "stealth" virus was also the first PC virus, the Pakistani BRAIN.
On activation, it would go resident in memory, intecepting calls to the floppy
disk. If the boot sector of an infected floppy was requested, it would return
instead the real boot sector code that had been stored elsewhere on the disk.

As far as I know, the firt time the word "stealth" was applied to a virus was
to the 4096, a file infector that, when resident would intercept all calls
for infected files, strip the viral code off, and return the original
uninfected file to DOS so that signature scanners could be thwarted. Very
quickly scanner authors added memory checking mechanisms to reveal these
activities.

The vulnerability is that for a "stealth" virus to be active, it must become
resident and intercept calls that would reveal its presence. This residence
is detectable, usually with nothing more complex than CHKDSK, if the user
knows the meaning of the returns.

Memorize: "655360 total bytes memory".

Since I have not seen Patti on the net, will venture a guess: negative free
time, a condition many of us suffer from. For me, enough PC software comes my
way that I am ALWAYS at least five packages behind (received the
3.1 revision of _Coherant_ over a month ago & still haven't loaded the 3.0).
Add to a "real" (i.e. family supporting) 60 hr/week job that does not put
a PC on my desk & normal family life (Boy Scouts, maintenance on 7 toys [three
adults, two teenagers, two adolecents], cruise night, etc.) & new software is
normally accessed in my "free" time between midnight & 2 a.m. <sigh>.

Most of the "anti-virus reseachers" also have "real" jobs that have
little to do with PCs (Ross and John excepted), this is probably why Europe
and Canada lead the US in real research, testing, and laboratories. While a
Novell network in my den closet (where my PCs are) is a possibility, it is
not one that I have spent any time on, even if I had some ethernet cards
(besides my Columbia has only one expansion slot & it is occupied).

Up until recently, boot sector infectors such as Stoned, Ping-Pong, & MusicBug
have required physical contact with a floppy to spread. Only with TELEDISK or
SENDDISK could an entire floppy (including boot sector) be sent electronically
(e.g. FTP). The only other way for these viruses to spread via FTP would be if
embedded in a trojan.

Subject: Addendum to FLU_SHOT+ Product Test (PC)

ADDENDUM for Product Test PT-27, May 1991, subject:  FLU_SHOT+

	Several days after transmitting PT-27 for FLU_SHOT+ the author
sent me an electronic message, also posted to Virus-L, informing me
that version 1.82 was now available.  The author also advised me that
the "free" demonstration copy of Virex-PC would no longer be included
with FLU_SHOT+.

	While I was aware that a version 1.82 was available, I chose
to limit my comments to version 1.81 because I had access to it
through simtel20.  As mentioned in the product test analysis, I have
never received any official notification of FLU_SHOT+ upgrades even
though I am a registered user.  While INTERNET is usually faster than
U.S. postal channels, it was not fast enough in this instance.

        The "free" Virex-PC demonstration is now available at many
locations to include simtel20 in the path:

			pd1:<msdos.trojan-pro>virx14.zip

	I apologize for any inconvenience.
