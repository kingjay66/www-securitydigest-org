JDR Microdevices now has a password security card which they call
"Gatekeeper."  This plugs into an 8-bit slot, prevents the machine from
booting without a valid password (even from floppy), and can have up to
15 passwords per card (could be useful for shared machines).  It does
not modify the partition table or any other part of the disk, and it
does not encrypt data.  I have no affiliation with JDR, and I have not
tested the card -- I'm merely mentioning its availability and advertised
functions.

Vesselin and several others are right in that software alone cannot
provide adequate security for a PC.  In fact, the National Computer
Security Center states that "... users should be wary of claims for
products (particularly software) which claim to provide 'absolute'
security"  (NCSC-WA-002-85, "Personal Computer Security
Considerations").  Because of how PCs are implemented, any software-only
security system cannot possibly guarantee a secure system.  I have
successfully bypassed software security schemes, including two
commercial packages which supposedly prevent access to the hard disk
when booted from a floppy.  I'm sure Vesselin, Padgett, and others have
done so as well.  Anyway, to make a long story short ("too late" :-) ),
it is NOT possible to write a program which cannot be bypassed by
booting from a diskette.

I have long decried that fact that hard drive manufacturers still have
not thought to include a cheap and simple write protect switch on hard
drives.  (Yes, I do know that most removable media drives have write
protect tabs, I'd just like to find a drive under $1000 that'll do it.)

It was pointed out to me at a recent seminar, by one of the attendees who
had access to a bunch of old equipment, that very old hard drives for
PC's, based on mainframe models, did, indeed, have such a switch.

Anybody wanna sell a really old drive?  :-)

Yes, boot sector infectors, such as the Stoned, BRAIN, Joshi, Azusa etc.,
do exactly this.  All disks have a boot sector, and therefore all disks
can be infected, even if they have no programs on them, and even if they
are not "bootable".

In the Macintosh world this has already happened.  Hypercard contains a
"language" which can be extended to perform system level activities, and
Hypercard "stacks", which are basically data, have been made to contain
viral functions.  In the PC world this has not, to my knowledge, been
done, but it is quite possible with the right systems.  Any program which
has a scripting or macro language is a possibility.

As you stated, the version of VIRUCIDE that you first tested is an
older one.  And, both SCAN and VIRUCIDE are written by McAfee
Associates.  As I believe they stated, when the issue was raised
before, both programs contain the same "signature strings".  Because
the signature strings are contained within the program code, SCAN sees
VIRUCIDE as being infected.

They fixed this in the later version of VIRUCIDE.

It's completely possible that there's no virus at all.  Does the
machine lock up when this happens?  My thoughts would be that if the
SCAN package doesn't detect the virus, you should have someone look at
your video hardware (the video card, in particular).  I've seen cards
go bad in such a way that they print spurious characters over the
screen (usually bad video memory/decode).

Hope this helps,
Regards,

Since I'm quite interested in the subject, I wanted to ask if a virus
can be lagal. I now every country has it's own rules, but I haven't
heard of a law agains viruses, have you?  One more point: Viruses may
be thought as a way of corrupting other user's data. But what about
software piracy? If one copies hacked software, then why shouldn't
viruses hit him?

 I'd like to hear you comments.

There have been previous reports to Virus-L of false positives where
one anti-viral package identified another as being infected.  In
particular, reports of SCAN saying that VIRUCIDE might be the 12
Tricks Trojan have been common.  These reports are indeed false
positive.  There is a simple reason for these false positives.  An
anti-viral scan package looks for virus signature strings.  Another
anti-viral package may legitimately contain the same virus signature
strings.  These false positives would be even more common except that
some anti-viral packages conceal the signature strings by encryption.

False positives where one anti-viral package says another is infected
are common, and are caused by finding a signature in the signature
search code.

This problem is due to an old version of VIRUCIDE containing the same
strings as VIRUSCAN and has been corrected for quite a while.  I don't
remember the version of VIRUCIDE it was fixed in, but I believe it was
2.1x or 2.2x.  The current version of VIRUCIDE that Parsons' Technology
is shipping is 2.30.  They've got new packaging with a picture of what
looks like a beetle on the cover.

Well, one out of two isn't bad.  It is compressed with LZEXE.

A really old version of VIRUCIDE.  Last time I looked at it, it was around
60 or 80Kb long...

Hmm... VIRUCIDE shouldn't write to the disk, are you sure you aren't running
any other TSR anti-viral programs?

This is one of the subjects that continually comes up in comp.virus, so
let me reiterate it, at the possible expense of wasting bandwidth and
boring one or two of you:  It's always a good idea to have the latest
version of anti-viral software available, and not rely on old, outdated
versions which may have compatibility problems of some sort or another.
Keep a copy of the last release on a floppy or somewhere safe as a backup
in case problems are reported and you need to migrate back to an older
version, but still, try to keep up to date and watch the network or the
manufacturer's BBS, fax, etcetera for notices of bugs in the software or
announcements of new releases...

Well, almost all of the currect memory resident viruses contain their
signatures at a fixed offset of a paragraph boundary. You have only to
scan memory in 16-byte paragraphs and to check whether the signature
is at the known offset. This speeds up the things. Unfortunately,
there are still viruses like Whale that use run-time sliding window
encryption, but they are rare enough.

Anyway, the problem with "ghosting" has occured with files long time
ago. Some scanners still cause false positives because they find the
signature that another anti-virus program also uses. Fortunately, now
most self-respecting scanners use some kind of encoding (not
encryption!) and solve such problems. How much have we to wait, until
these scanners also clean up the memory they have used before exiting?

IMHO, ghosting will decrease in the near future, because those that
make scanners sill become aware of it and will take measures against
it.

Yeah, the same problem occures when someone browes such a disinfected
program with PCTools or Norton Utilities. I kept getting quiestions
like "why after disinfecting Dark Avenger with your program I still
can see the 'Eddie lives' message in files?", until I began to
overwrite the virus body with zeroes before disconnecting it from the
file. Now I think that every disinfector should perform this way,
regardless which virus is disinfected...

Well, I still cannot understand why a scanner should look for, say,
the Dark Avenger virus in DOS' buffers! McAfee's SCAN causes a ghost
false positive immediately after you copy an infected file...

   security  measures  without  harm or contamination of  the  system.  The
   infected  programs  can  be  renamed  and  copied  to  other  disks  and
   directories as bait for virus detecting programs.

   Viruses  are  a  form  of  terrorism  and  require  many  of  the   same
   precautionary  measures.  Airports  test  the  effectiveness  of   their
   security  measures  in  much the same way. An official  disguised  as  a
   passenger will attempt to bring a disarmed bomb through, trying to evade
   security   measures  and  avoid  detection.  Real  viruses,  like   real
   terrorists,  are  much  more difficult to test with.  The  test  viruses
   generated by Virus Simulator are safe and sterile, but form a validation
   test suite that trigger vigilant virus detectors.

   Virus  Simulator  creates simulated test suites for  every  known  virus
   available  at the time of release.  These test suites are only safe  and
   sterile  simulations  to  evaluate  your  security  measures.  A   virus
   detecting  program is validated when it reports the  simulations.  Virus
   detecting  programs  that  fail to find  these  simulations  may  indeed
   discover  their  real counterparts and variations, but  should  only  be
   trusted after that ability is demonstrated.

   No  virus  protection  program  will  ever  be  effective  without   the
   cooperation of its users, and Virus Simulator provides a means to verify
   compliance with established security procedures.

   System  Administrators should design their own tests to see which  users
   are practicing safe computing and complying with established safeguards.
   The  amount of user cooperation required by anti-virus programs  varies.
   Some  users require more automatic and regimented procedures, and  Virus
   Simulator  provides  system  administrators  with  a  practical  way  to
   evaluate  the  overall effectiveness of their security  measures.  These
   simulated  test viruses are sterile; they won't reproduce and spread  by
   themselves, so they have to be planted (copied). Such an exercise can go
   a long way to raising the vigilance of complacent users, so when a  real
   virus attacks, destructive damage is held to a minimum.

   Comments  and  suggestions  are  would  be  appreciated  and  should  be
   addressed directly to:
