VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: Hepnet or Wank worm (VAX VMS)

Having not had access to a DEC mainframe and ACSnet for a year or so,
I've lost track of what was happening with the Hepnet/Wank worm that had
been reported to be screaming around mainframe nets.
Can anyone update me on what has happened to that worm??

[Ed. Two versions of WANK were seen on SPAN and other DECNET networks
in October 1989.  Both versions seemed to run their course within a
couple of days.  CERT put out an advisory (filename
CA-89:04.decnet.wank.worm) on October 17, 1989 - available by
anonymous FTP on cert.sei.cmu.edu in pub/cert_advisories.  The
advisory provides an analysis of the WANK worms.]

Far cry from the Justice, eh?

Observation number 1: Interferon is outdated.  Many of the
applications that are around now did not exist when Bob Woodhead first
wrote Interferon.  Furthermore, some of the applications that were
around then (notably TOPS) caused Interferon to issue erroneous
messages.  The aide in question should be using the much more recent
Disinfectant (freeware), SAM 2.0 (from Symantec), Virex (from HJC), or
Rival (Microseeds I think).

Observation 2: Mac viruses are not easier to write than PC viruses for
the same reason Mac application are not easier to write than PC
applications.  Apple has a varied & well defined set out routines
(together they comprise something called the Macintosh Toolbox) for
things like opening and closing files, drawing windows on the screen,
creating buttons and menu items and so on.  There's a five volume,
several hundred page tome devoted to documenting these routines!  It
is much easier to write viruses for DOS based systems (and I suspect
Windows is included here) because DOS has a much simpler set routines
available from the operating system.  If I've confused you there, take
a good look at the number of different viruses and strains of viruses
that infect each platform.  When I last checked (and this was awhile
ago), there were some 5 different Mac viruses, with no more than five
variations on a particular strain: total of about a dozen Mac viruses.
At the time, the number of PC viruses numbered 23 distinct strains and
over a 100 total viruses.  Alot of has to do with the number of
vandals writing viruses for the Mac vs. DOS, but it also has to do the
relative ease with which viruses can be written for DOS vs.  the Mac.

Observation 3: The only way a virus can infect a clean system is (as
you correctly surmised) someone has to bring an infected application
on to the clean system.  The infected application does not have to
come from home though.  There have been cases (mentioned here) where
applications are bought off-the-shelf, shrink wrap intact, that are
infected.  This is a fundamental characteristic of all viruses,
although some viruses are smart enough to use the facilities of the
target machine's operating system to infect the machine without a
specific application being run.  They use facilities that are always
"running" on the computer.

Trivia: Former Gov. Dukakis is the only political figure to have a
virus named for him.  In the early days of the '88 Presidential
campaign, a teenager in Florida wrote a virus that infected Hypercard
stacks.  The virus in question would flash a message "Dukakis in '88"
or some-such.  There is no connection between the young man and
Dukakis or Dukakis' Presidential campaign.

It would seem to be a waste for any virus to affect EMS, as not all pc
users have exp/ext memory, while ALL users (I hope!) have 1 MB.
Furthermore, I would assume that any hi memory managers would be able
to detect a change in high memory, as they usually intercept the
vectors.

Artifical intelligence?  For what purpose.  99% of scanning for
viruses just requires looking for a "search string".  The only way AI
might help is to see if there is more disk activity than normal, but
how do you define "more disk activity"?

Any thing is possible... whether it's likely or not is another
story...

True.  Viruses cannot infect text files, as they are never executed.
Viruses CAN look to see if a certain filetype is being accesses (i.e.
.DBF), but since there is no executable code in a text file, there is
no way a virus can "latch" onto the file.

Subject: STONED virus/ McAfee Associates (PC)

  We had a bit of trouble with PC's here around the university with
the stoned virus.  Luckily we had a write-protected and clean copy of
McAfee Accociates Scan and Clean programs.  It is very easy to use and
if you are a registered user, there is a help line in case you have
any problems or questions.  My computer was infected but I cleaned the
virus out before anything could happen.  This product is highly
recommended by myself and a couple other PC users around campus.

Subject: Detecting modified bootsectors (was:Re: Boot sector self-check (PC))

  The last few days I have read the discussion about detecting
bootsector and partitiontable viruses. What struck me was, that the
solution I use for over one year now, is still unknown to the net. The
solution, which can be found in BOOTCOMP.ZIP, is based on methods used
by these viruses (to catch a thief ....)

  Just like William A. Gatliff (gt154@prism.gatech.edu), I have
created a program to read and save the bootsector and partition table
to a file.  But what is new, or at least what I have not seen from
others, is that the program - BOOTCOMP.exe - that compares the
"current" bootsector and partition table with the saved one, uses the
ORIGINAL BIOS interrupts.

  "How does the program know where the original BIOS interrupts are?",
you may ask, "since they are different for each machine, depending on
the Bios and Harddisk controller".

  Well, the answer it is surprisingly simple. Eventhough I am not a
assembler whiz, I managed to write a piece of code in assembler. This
piece of code replaces the bootsector of a floppy disk, and should be
written to the bootsector of this disk. This can be done by a program in
the BOOTCOMP package (BOOTPUT.exe). Of course, before doing this, the
computer should have been booted from an uninfected system disk. The
file BOOTCOMP.exe should also be copied to the disk with the new
bootsector.

  After this has been done, the computer should be booted from this
floppy. The code in the bootsector then catches the original BIOS
interrupts and patches them to the file BOOTCOMP.exe. Since no software,
except in ROM, will be executed before executing the bootsector-code, it
is 100% sure that the interrupts saved are the original BIOS interrupts
(assuming installation of the new bootsector in an uninfected system).

  When the program BOOTCOMP.exe is called, it uses the original
interrupts to get the "current" bootsector and partition table. So even
if a virus has taken the interrupts, we will indeed get the true
information, and comparison is correct.

   I am sure that this method can detect ALL bootsector and partition
table viruses, also the ones that have yet to be developed by malicious
persons. However, since I only have access to one bootsector-virus,
maybe other netters will test if this statement holds true.

  I will upload the BOOTCOMP package to SIMTEL. As should be done more
often, the complete source code is included.

...but it's _highly_ unlikely that two PCs with the same type of disk
have both the same number of bad sectors and IN THE SAME PLACE.  In
fact, it's so unlikely that it's very suspicious.  That's not to say
that it's unlikely that there's a similar disk somewhere with exactly
the same bad sectors, but just two side-by-side PCs... no way!

Subject: Book review - "Consumer Report: Virus Scanners" (PC)

I finished reading "Consumer Report: Virus Scanners" by Dr. David
Stang of the National Computer Security Association.  This is an
*extensive* report of tests done on various virus scanning software.
Included in the test were:  Cterus LAN 2.0, EliaShim ViruSafe 3.06 and
3.08, Fink AntiVirus 9.0, HTScan 1.11, IBM's VirScan 1.3, McAfee Scan
V73, Skulason's F-Prot 112, and Trend's PC-cillin 2.95B.

The test gives comprehensive results of scanning against 95 different
viruses, boot sector infectors, and stealth viruses.  The report also
discusses issues of speed, accuracy, configurability, virus removal
and integrity protection as features, batch mode operation, and price.

My own personal conclusions are that the combination of F-PROT and
IBM's VirScan is by far the most effective (and most cost-effective)
combination you could possibly have.  The combined cost of the two for
a site license would be $26.  Compare that with a site license fee
that may run into several tens of thousands of $$ for McAfee's
products, which (in my opinion) don't work as well.  (It's a mystery
to me why people continue to use McAfee's products.)

The cited report, along with an excellent guide to virus
characteristics and statistics entitled "Computer Viruses," is
available from NCSA at:
	NCSA
	Suite 309

	Washington, DC 20008
	phone: 202-364-1304
	fax: 202-244-7875

Note that these reports apply ONLY to IBM-PC-type viruses and
software, not to Macs, Amigas, etc.

I have no direct or financial association with NCSA, and I've never
even met Dr. Stang, but I am very impressed by his efforts.  If you
have some budget for well-researched virus information, I'd say to
check these out.
