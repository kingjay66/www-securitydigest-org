VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Not altogether true, I fear. I'm hearing reports that some programs
don't work any more afer tering de-compressed as such, particularly in
the case of LZEXE.  I have to assume then, that just because a scanner
gives a clean bill of health to a such a file in it's
recently-uncompressed-state, doesn't mean that it's compresed parent
isn't dangerous.

Subject: IDE drive infection. (PC)

I was wondering how the following would be handled:

   1. The Disk Killer virus infects and encrypts an IDE hard drive.

   2. Apparently this type drive cannot be effectively/correctly low level
   formatted.

   3. If a user cannot find the key to decrypt the drive after
   being infected by Disk Killer, what to do? Would a high level
   format be effective in this case?

Inquiring minds wish to know?

We have a virus floating around called YAUNCH.  I don't know what it
does or how to get rid of it.  It has attached itself to a DOS 4.01
file called IFSFUNC.EXE.  I don't know what that file is, either.

If anybody has any ideas, please reply directly.

Subject: autocad non-virus (PC)

I made a posting a little while ago about a suspected virus infecting
autocad.

We have since discovered that we did not have a virus.  There was a
program in the root directory that was called by the autoexec.bat.
The program is a TSR that pops up the alien every 5 minutes or so.
This was clearly an act of vandalism, but was not a virus.  I
apologize for the scare and appreciate your help and interest.  Thank
you

Why do you need to execute them first.  Some virus scanners can scan
compressed executables, and besides you can first expand the
executable with the proper expander, and then scan it.  The dilemma
really is that, for example, all PKLITE'd executables cannot be
expanded.  Perhaps it wasn't such a hot idea to sell the
unexpandable compression version by PkWare.

If you get /pc/ts/tsbat27.arc batch collection from our archives, it
contains among other things a batch to do this for you.  Take a
look, and judge for yourself.

Moreover - there is too liitle space in BOOT sector to place all the
neccessary code and data there. Modified BOOT could load a special
program from the root directory instead of IO.SYS/IBMBIO.COM.
I didn't describe details since the main idea is just the
same and is RATHER simple.

tracing.

This is the main idea - drive control away from virus!

Yes. This person was A.Sessa from Dniepropetrovsk, Ukraine. He
suggested this idea last November at All-Union Anti-Virus Conference
in Kiev.  You were there. Me too.

Yes, it is. I didn't know this virus came from Bulgaria. Don't you
know the author?
This August a lot of PCs were infected at WDNH in Moscow (main Soviet
exhibition) with this virus. So it is spread all over the USSR now.
There are already several Soviet disinfectors available.
Once again: is it meaningfull to PUBLISH a DETAILED description of
a virus? Will it not encourage new virus-writers? Maybe it is worth
to organize a special E-mail anti-virus conference not so opened
as VIRUS-L/comp.virus for exchanging such an info and viruses among
anti-virus specialists.

I have Bezrukov's E-mail address: bnn@softp.kiev.ua . I sent a
message or two to him but got no response. Maybe something is
wrong with this address.

Can you name these researches?

One mutant virus is STARSHIP - it contains encrypted string
">STARSHIP_1<". It is both MBR and file infector. Uses 4th text video
page - so it doesn't work on PCs with monochrome.  When an infected
program is being executed the virus just infects BOOT and doesn't
remain resident. It stays resident when an infected disk is booted.
Infects .EXE and .COM files being copied to floppy.

Another one is TEQUILA. Also MBR/file infector. Contains encrypted
strings "Welcome to T.TEQUILA's latest production", "Contact
T.TEQUILA/P.o.Box 543/6312 St'hausen/Switzerland", "Loving thoughts to
L.I.N.D.A.", "BEER and TEQUILA forever!", "Execute: mov ax, FE03 / int
21.  Key to go on!". Infects .COM and .EXE when executed.

Both use some stealth technique. Both mutate only in files, leaving
MBR code the same.

I meant POWERFUL ENOUGH regular expressions. For example, including

Thanks to everyone who responded to my tale of viruses on campus, especially
to the ones who responded politely.
Thanks for the suggestion of Disinfectant; we do already have it, it's
available on our AppleTalk server, and the main problem is educating people
to use it wisely and often.
I was not trying to claim that Mac viruses are more prevalent in general; I
was relating our experiences here.  We have had PCs since '85 and college-
owned Macs since '88.

There was an interesting post to comp.risks discussing the statistics
associated with false positives and false negatives of a medical test
(MSFAP, which tests for some type of birth defects, but that part isn't
relevant here).  An analogy can be drawn between it and computer virus
detection routines (I'll avoid the term "virus scanner").

In the anti-virus field, T would refer to the output from a virus
detection program, and D would refer to the diagnosis of a person
experienced in virus detection and removal.

The first generation of virus detection programs were yes/no tests;
that is, they looked for a particular sequence of bytes and indicated
whether or not they found them.  Because of the likelihood of a "clean"
program having the same sequence, the false positive rate was high.

Later generations of virus detection programs perform two or more tests
(sequence-matching, algorithmic, or whatever) and generate (internally)
a quantitative result, and if this result is high enough (above some
threshold), it reports an infection.  This reduces the false positive
rate, but can, coupled with the increasing number and complexity of
viri, increase the false negative rate.  If the approriate tests are
selected and an appropriate threshold is used, an acceptable balance
between the false positive and false negative rates can be achieved
(what is "appropriate" and what is "acceptable" is relative and not to
be defined here).  The very latest ones now give a somewhat
quantitative result, such as "Possibly infected...," "Infected with new
strain...," and so forth.  This helps to decrease the false negative
rate, while helping to control, or at least identify, false positives.
(don't get me started on heuristics :-) )

As stated above, the false positive rate is the number of T+ given D-,
divided by the number of D-.  In other words, if you tested only people
without the disease, the false positive rate is the rate of positive
test results you would get.  For this rate to be accurate, the people
tested would have to be a suitable sample from the entire population.
However, if you took a sample from a population which tested positive
but diagnosed negative, the rate would be abnormally high.  Also, for
argument's sake, if you took whatever factor makes a person test
positive and distributed it among the sample population, the rate would
again be abnormally high.  However, if you tested this same biased
population with a second test, which was equally accurate but tested a
different factor, the rate would remain accurate.  Since none of the
people are really positive, the false negative rates cannot be measured.

Similarly, the false positive rate of a virus detection program is the
number of T+ given D-, divided by the number of D-.  If you tested only
programs without a virus, the false positive rate is the rate of
positive test results you would get.  For this rate to be accurate, the
programs tested would have to be a suitable sample from the entire set
of programs (you can see it coming, can't you).  Virus Simulator
creates a population of programs including factors which make programs
test positive to some tests.  Using this biased population, the false
positive rates for detection programs which use those factors will be
abnormally high.  The rates for detection programs which don't use
those factors will be unchanged.  Since none of the files contain
genuine infections, the false negative rates cannot be measured.
Therefore, Virus Simulator cannot possibly be used to test virus
detection programs.  I hope that this can help quantify some people's
reservations about Virus Simulator.

It has been pointed out in some other postings that the files created
by Virus Simulator can be used to help train people in the use of anti-
viral software.  The rationale is that it is safer to use fake viri
than real ones.  I agree with this completely --  that's why I created
a "defanged" version of "Stoned."  However, this is only valid if the
detection program selected gives false positives on the simulations
(and yes, this applies to my creation too).  It's pretty worthless if
the selected detection program passes off the simulations as not real.
Also, you cannot train users to remove viri with simulations (except by
ERASE or FORMAT or the like, which is sometimes not desirable).

That's the last I'm going to say about Virus Simulator (and there was
much rejoicing :-) ).  It would probably be best if we all put Virus
Simulator with the other Bad Ideas with Good Intentions and forget it.
As a certain unnamed person once said, "It is best to let sleepy dragons
and Virus Simulators lie,"  and as Gene Roddenberry once said, "Let's
move on to the next thing."

Hello, everybody!

A lot of people requested more exact bibliographic references of
Cohen's papers and about scientific papers treating the computer virus

only the scientiffic papers (I omitted even the excellent technical
but not scientiffic papers published by Virus Bulletin), and only
