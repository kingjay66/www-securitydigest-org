VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

This is true and I often use almost the same arguments, when I'm
trying to explain the people the the producers of anti-virus software
do not need to write and release viruses in order to promote their
programs. It is fully sufficient that they use the media hype. What
they often do, unfortunately... :-(

More exactly, he used the infective length of the viruses (as one of
their signifficant properties) to name them. He released this naming
scheme long time ago, when it turned out to be inappropriate. His
current version of the Toolkit uses a completely different naming
convention.

Because it seems so "natural". :-) At that time almost all known
viruses had different infective lengths, and it was easy to see that a
file has increased in size.

The question what exactly caused the increasing number of new viruses
can be argued ad infinitum without much use, so let's drop this
discussion.

Expert systems are just computer programs, but nevertheless, they are
considered as part of the Artificial Intelligence science and not of
the computer science. And not so longtimes ago, compiler writing was
considered a science too... I suggest that you read Aho & Uhlman's
book "Principles of Compiler Design".

The human genome consists of finite number of relatively well-known
atoms. Does this mean that trying to decrypt it leads to "no
discoveries" and involves "no research"?

No, we're conducting research into a (relatively) well-known
artificial phenomenon.

This indeed conforms with Cohen's definition of computer virus in the
broad sense, since he includes the user in the computer system. I
slightly disagree with him at this point, however, and I also have the
feeling that I am not alone... :-)

If this is true, it proves that such science is really useful, since
it already beared some useful fruits. Can you tell however which
commercial programs use viral techniques? (By viral techniques I mean
self-replication, not the different hacker's tricks like interrupt
tracing that help the viruses to fool the anti-virus programs but have
nothing to do with the replication process.)

The purpose of the scientific research is to define the goals and the
effective ways to achieve them. Only when they are defined, come the
"practical" commercial implementations...

I may sound surprising, but even such practical things as writing a
good word processor or a fast and efficient file system involve a lot
of science. Think about the Boyer-Moore algorithm for fast string
search; the "dining philosophers" problem; and see my remark about the
compiler design above.

There is probably something in that, but remember that the main virus
problems are coming from a quite small number of old viruses (written
when virus scanners weren't quite so much in the news), that have
simply had enough time to spread. There is a difference between
talking about "most known viruses" and "the viruses that are found
most often".  In the future, perhaps, these many varied viruses may be
the big problem, but not at the moment.

I suspect that:

(a) The people with virus scanners are tending to stop viruses
spreading past them (the extent to which a scanner-only approach stops
further infection could be debated, of course). You might like to
think of a little boy with his finger in a hole of the dyke, but I
prefer to think of two or three people with closed doors on the
Titanic, hoping to stop the water come into their room.

(b) The viruses' real breeding ground is the many *MANY* more
computers without anti-virus measures. It spreads when it is quiet,
when the computer user not only doesn't know it is there, but when
there seems to reason to worry about anti-viral precautions. The most
successful viruses work mainly by ignorance on the part of the user,
rather than smart tricks to beat the greatest virus detectors. Think
of stoned - sure it is easy to spot, yet there are enough people with
no protection at all for it to spread in a big way.

(c) Reports of vast increases in viruses are only coming through after
the virus is noticed (when it delivers its payload, or spreads to a
scanned computer).  That is the real problem: that viruses are allowed
to grow unrestrained, because a small percentage of users bother to
watch for them; the real size of the problem could be (and probably
is) much bigger than reported. To this extent, I would say that
reliance on scanners is failing: the present use of scanners is too
rare. Something (scanner or other protection) should be either built
into DOS or distributed for free. [Thinks: there are already free
virus detectors, yet only a small percentage of users have them or use
them properly, I wonder why?]

(d) All of this boils down to a great time for virus writers. There
might be some powerful psychology at work here, trying to beat
successive versions of virus scanner; that might account for a large
number of slightly different viruses, but probably not explain the
success of the old ones. I don't care if continual advances in
anti-virus techniques are seen as a challange by some people, I want
it to be *harder* for a virus to survive. It is simply that, at the
present, what we need most of all is NOT a fancier anti-virus tool
(unless it is so nice to use people use it more often), rather a
concerted attack on the relatively old viruses, even with old
software, but on almost all computers rather than only a handful of
them.

Now, all you need to do is to work out how to make that happen.

    Hmmm...  Understand that that 'premise' can be reversed, and

'bad' software cannot overcome 'good'.  Therein lies paradox.)

    Yeah, I'd like to.  You're wrong.  The most common viruses
(Stoned and Jerusalem) have been around well before all of the
currently existing scanners.  Even the Disk Killer, Ping Pong,
and even the Dark Avenger were out well before the majority of
the present scanners came out.  I think you might consider looking
into the history of the psuedo-industry before making general
comments like that.

    Moreover, anti-virus programs are most certainly diminishing
the virus numbers.  You can't state that they are *NOT* without
having an adequate comparison

Greetings,
    Actually, it was more of an observation of your level of experience
with viruses.  He's correct too, as I'll discuss later.

    This is such a bad idea, that I don't think you really mean it.
Frankly, exactly how would you go about doing this with a variable
encryption virus?  How do you know if it *IS* the virus, so you can
call the decryption routine?  What if its a virus which pretends
to be the said virus, and actually has code that does something
dangerous if executed out of its 'normal' location?

    Sir, this statement shows that you *DO* have very very little
experience with encrypted viruses.  I suggest that you do a bit of
research first, (and I have made that comment to you in the past)
before jumping in with both feet stuck firmly in your mouth.

how would we *KNOW* that a file was infected to check the size

    The original concept, from 'The Horse's Mouth' was that it could
not be detected by *A* string.  There is no such thing as a virus
which cannot be detected given any number of strings.  Think about
it.

    There is no difficulty with 'variable-size' viruses, it is the
variable ENCRYPTION which is difficult.  This is where you clearly
show that you have not worked with these viruses, and is why I
support Vesselin's comments regarding your experience.  You are
among professional anti-virus workers here.  We have worked with
these viruses.  I'm sure you have a realm of knowledge, in which
you are excellent.  Please confine yourself to statements about
which you have knowledge.

     Perhaps you might consider studying the facts, before making
untoward comments about the skills and personalities of the other
professionals on this forum.

My understanding is that IBM does exactly that.  It arbitrarily changes
the file type on all executables, thus protecting the user from
inadvertantly executing a Trojan Horse program.  Of course CHRISTMA was
able to spread wildly simply by inviting users to execute it, so
changing the file type will not protect the net from users, but it may
protect some users from the net.

I understand that IBM also arbitrarily throws away, without notice, any
file in the net that has a name that looks remotely like Christmas.

It is interesting that while propagation via the net is faster and more
disruptive than via diskette, it is less persistent.  This is in part
because you have a place to stand to both filter and purge.

Spread in PC LANs involves the server, the workstation, and diskettes.
In addition, while it does offer a place to stand to filter, it does not
offer any place to stand to purge.  Therefore, it tends to offer the
worst of both worlds.  The virus spreads rapidly from diskette to
workstation to server to workstations to diskettes where it is difficult
to find and is otherwise persistent.

The discussion here re: NetWare is not NetWare specific.  Everything
said here is equally applicable to the other popular servers and
workstation shells.

I had a report from a system administrator that both his NetWare
server software and his Vines software were broken.  He had configured
both to resist any user writing and yet files on both had become
infected.  I suggested that while I might believe that one or the
other was broken, believing (before breakfast) that both were broken
was a little much.  I suggested that it was far more likely that both
were misconfigured or that a supervisor had logged on to both from an
infected workstation.  He assured me that one of the two swore that he
had not done so.  The other admitted to having logged on but "he had
not executed any programs."

We deployed a thousand LANs today and created a thousand new
administrators.  How many do you suppose understand how to configure a
server to resist the spread of viurses?  How many even understand that
they cannot logon to a server without executing programs in the
workstation?  How many understand that they should never logon to a
server from a workstation that they did not initialize from their own
known source?

This is a forwarded message from John McAfee...

- -------------------------
                        V I R U S   W A R N I N G

        A new, fast moving, and very destructive virus has been
reported from multiple countries in Eastern Europe.  The virus uses
a completely new technique for infecting and replicating and it
cannot be easily identified or removed with existing anti-virus
removers.

The virus infects by first placing itself in the last cluster of
host disks.  It then modifies the directory entries for all
executable files in the system so that the directory chains point
to the virus.  Then it encrypts the original pointers for the
executable files and places the encrypted pointers in unused space
within the directory area.  The result of this is that
whenever a program is executed, the virus is loaded into memory.
The virus, in turn, loads the program for execution.  Programs
themselves are not modified.

A disruptive characteristic of this virus is that if an infected
system is booted from a clean floppy, none of the executable files
can be copied from the system.  Neither can they be backed up.  If
the system is not booted from a clean floppy, then the files can
be copied and backed up, but the virus will copied along with the
programs.  It's a catch 22 situation.  Additionally, if an infected
system is booted from a clean floppy, and then a CHKDSK /F
is run, then all executable files in the system will be destroyed.


The virus is also a stealth virus.  While it is active in memory
it is difficult to detect.

The Virus has been named DIR-2.  It has been reported at numerous
sites in Bulgaria, Poland, Yugoslavia and Hungary.  We received our
copy for analysis from Tamas Szalay in Budapest.

The virus spreads more rapidly than any virus yet discovered.
Vesselin Bontchev in Bulgaria reports that it has become the most
reported virus in his country within the past few weeks.

We are currently re-writing our SCAN and CLEAN programs to deal
with this virus, as are most other anti-virus suppliers.  A beta
version of both programs will be available September 26th.  Anyone
reporting symptoms similar to the above described, please
contact us.

Yes, indeed, I forgot to mention these... And some viruses (e.g., the
Flip-like ones) use to shorten a bit and existing partition, in order
to create space for their body.

My definition is: Dir II modifies the directory entries in such a way
that the executable files described in them -appear- to contain the
virus body.

I did. I know this very well and still think that it is a bad
approach. There are too many execfile compressors - should everybody's
scanner be able to cope with all of them? IMNSHO, we need a shell
program (a la Shez), that is able to unpack the compressed files and
to run a user supplied scanner on them.

Yes, indeed, I forgot to mention these... And some viruses (e.g., the
Flip-like ones) use to shorten a bit and existing partition, in order
to create space for their body.

My definition is: Dir II modifies the directory entries in such a way
that the executable files described in them -appear- to contain the
virus body.

I did. I know this very well and still think that it is a bad
approach. There are too many execfile compressors - should everybody's
scanner be able to cope with all of them? IMNSHO, we need a shell
program (a la Shez), that is able to unpack the compressed files and
to run a user supplied scanner on them.

How do you achieve this by using only the PATH variable? That is, how
do you prevent the files in the current directory on the data disk
from being executed (if the data disk is also the current drive)?

Unless the protection is achieved by a strong cryptographic scheme,
there is no way to prevent the information from being read, using
software only... And no way of protecting the disk from being
destroyed, regardless of the software protection used... Or do I miss
something? How do you achieve your protection exactly?

the time you all took to help me. It is good to know that there is a large
group of knowledgable people I can turn to when I have a problem or questions.

Thanks again.

It derives from abstract computation theory - somewhat related to the
"Halting Problem" for Turning Machines - It is in general hard to
determine the purpose and untimate effect of a computer program and
thus decide if it is, say, a virus.

This picture is confounded by the fact that reporting is not uniform.
Sites that use scanners will report more occurances of virues.  Much
of the increased count of new viruses come from having an
international reporting system developing, and from counting
variations

I do not think there is a causal relationship "Use of virus scanners
- -> new viruses."  I get pissed off by stuff that suggests anti-virus
developers are somehow the cause of the problem.  Without these tools
most people would be up a creek.

The one mechanism I can think of would be that scanners may make it a bit
easier for yahoos to "capture" a copy of an existing virus.

I would like to see more use of OS/hardware protection, but I'm not
holding my breath.

Subject: F-Prot 2.0 (PC)

I just downloaded a copy of F-Prot 2.0 and have a few questions:

1.  I remember reading that it is incompatible with Zenith DOS 3.3+,
which is true, at least to the degree that F2 stops at the end of the
list of viruses (Attacker) and gives the following message: error
reading drive C:. Is VIRSTOP.EXE also incompatible, or can it be still
used as a first line of defense?

2. The documentation speaks of a single copy of VIRSTOP.EXE installed
on a server, so that every single machine would be protected.
Obviously not machines with hard drives, or am I wrong?  But also, I
fail to see how a machine using start chips would be protected.  To
explain our circumstances: not in all instances do people who boot off
the start chip log into the network, so that the config.sys on the
Start volume is used, but no autoexec.bat file.  This allows
non-network users without boot disks to use the stations without
asking for a boot disk, and leaves them more room in memory.  With
F-Prot 1.6, I simply installed F- DRIVER.SYS on each start volume of
the network (I use about 5 different start volumes, depending on
classes, accounts, etc.).  So far it worked, although I understand
that the lack of infections may have been pure luck.  Anyway, do I
understand the new directions correctly: Load VIRSTOP.EXE in the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file of the server(s) to protect the entire system?  Or
should I again load VIRSTOP.EXE on each start volume (3Com 3+Share
system)?

Thanks,
