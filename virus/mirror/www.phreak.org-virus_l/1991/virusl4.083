Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,

Remember that we can't even get the user community (the folks who
spend their hard earned money to buy my products!) to make backups to
protect themselves.  They seem to prefer that somebody do that
protection for them.  Obviously if an ad indicates that Product A
protects against 400 viruses -- and it might even be true -- that's
going to offer 25% (or 33%) more protection than one that scans for
"only" 300 viruses.

Do you think the public is going to respond favorably to a condom that
protects against the AIDS virus 99% of the time as compared to one
that protects against it 99.9% of the time -- even when your odds of
getting "hit" with the AIDS virus are pretty slim to begin with.

Maximal Protection! That's what the market seems to clamour for.

And the marketing dudes I work with closely at Microcom tell me what
we can lose a site license because of and where our strong points are:
I recall one site license potential that was lost on our not catching
the Whale Virus in an early cut of our code.  You know how difficult
it is to get the Whale Virus to infect something without crashing your
system, right?  Well, the site license didn't and that cost a
bunch-o-bucks.

Now, of course, we catch the Whale Virus.  The next time a site
license asks we can put on our best Grey Poupon voice and say "Of
course. Of course."

>Is there any hope that the anti-virus community might band together
>(for a moment, at least!) and decide that the numbers game shall be
>played ONLY with viruses that have appeared in reliably-confirmed
>real-world incidents?

Speaking on my own behalf, I hope so.  Speaking on behalf of Microcom
(which I can't do in any case), marketing has to stay competitive.
So, when one of our competitors says "Yes, but do you want to risk
even the slightest chance of getting infected with this virus if it
escapes into the wild.", my marketing can respond "Ha! We already
protect you against that nasty virus!".

>Virus Bulletin (and others less respectable) to stop using 300+
>viruses, including losers like the Anti-Pascals, in their evaluations,
>and so on.

As long as the advertising works (and is used by the competition) it
would be suicide to drop out of the numbers game -- see my new release
blurb below for an example of why we must continually play the damned
game.  Yes, I picked up a bunch-o new strings for this cut of the
code.  More important to me, though, are the minor enhancements that
make the code easier to use.

Hear, hear!  I would love to be able to impress that upon people
rather than the numbers game.  The first people to convince would be
in MIS, though: now how do you convince them that your second point is
more important than the numbers games?

Until then, I have to provide the marketing dudes at Microcom with
ammunition for winning on both points you make.

Subject: New VIRx Release (PC)

I'm pleased to announce a new release of the *FREE* scanner we put
out as a demo of Virex-PC.  This scanner is completly useable for
scanning against viruses: it is not crippled in any way.  The only
difference between it and Virex-PC's scanner (one part of the Virex-PC
package) is in the disinfectors included in the commercially available
product.

Here's the "WHATS.NEW" file.

                   What's New In VIRx Version 1.4
                   ==============================
Date: 5/11/91

   1. VIRx now scans memory above 640K through 1 Meg if the -X command line
   option is selected.  This feature is added for detection of viruses like
   E.D.V. that search high memory for writable RAM, and for protection
   against possible infected device drivers that have been loaded high.
   Note:  Many programs use that area of memory for special disk caching
   and this has been noted to have caused some problems with incorrect
   results for some machines.

   2. If a batch mode is selected, the resulting screens will now time out
   if you do not hit a key and the scan will continue.  This makes the batch
   mode fully useable for unattended operation.

   3. When this software becomes outdated, it will warn the user that scanning
   with outdated software can result in new viruses being missed. Then the
   user can elect to continue the scan anyway. Previous versions of VIRx
   would cease to function on the cut-off date; this is no longer the case,
   although you are advised to update your software before that date arrives.
   We consider VIRx 1.4 to be outdated by October, 1991, although we recommend
   obtaining each monthly update of VIRx in any case.

   4. VIRx 1.4 detects over 50 newly discovered viruses, bringing the total to
   over 400. This was accomplished without slowing down the scanner.

   5. VIRx 1.4 can now take multiple targets on the command line, allowing
   an entire set of file systems to be scanned:
      VIRx C:\ D: E:\thisdir F:\thatdir\thisfile
   scans the entire C: disk, the current directory on the D: drive and its
   children, the specified directory on the E: drive and its children and
   the specified file on the F: drive.  Any options you select on the command
   line are valid for each target you specify.

   6.  Both decompression routines, LZEXE and PKLITE, were optimized for
   speed of decompression and memory model independence.  String selection
   of compressed file hits take about 50% as long as did VIRx 1.2.


Problems Corrected from v1.2 :

   1. Problem with scanning certain Novell Network server volumes has been
   corrected.

   2. Execute-only files on Novell Networks are handled properly now on
   screen as well as in the log.

   3. There was a bug when write-protected files were scanned and discovered
   to contain a virus. Fixed.

   4. False positive on Marc Perkel's MARXMENU menu compiler Marxcomp.exe,
   version 2.27, for the KAMAKAZI virus has been corrected. Our apologies
   to Marc.

   3. PKLite from PKWare uses a special compression method on unusually highly
   compressible files that version 1.2 of VIRx did not decompress properly
   every time. This has been corrected, and VIRx 1.4 fully supports all
   compression methods used by PKLite as of version 1.05, still including
   the -e switch available in PKLite Professional.

Subject: Tequila virus (PC)

Has this been around for awhile?  Just in the last week or so, I've
heard of it from a couple of different, widely separated, places in
Europe, and I hadn't heard of it before.  Does anyone have a good
description written up?  I'm well into analyzing it, but it's always
nice to have someone else's notes to check myself against.  Just how
widespread does it seem?  Does anyone know of it "getting lucky"
(shipping with a commercial package, or anything on that order)?  DC

But I'm running SCAN while I boot up.  My system is a 8meg 386-33 w/CACHE and
DOS 3.3, so I don't use SHARE.

    CLEAN77 works well for networks.  I use it for our Netware 2.15
here at the University of Kansas.  There is a complementary program
called NETSCAN77 that will scan the server for viruses.  Once a virus
has been detected, you use CLEAN77 to cure it.

    McAffee and Associates is a very helpful company.  I recently
discovered a virus that NETSCAN will not detect on EXE files and
called them and told them about it.  They were very helpful and will
be putting out a solution to this problem in a couple of weeks.

Subject: SCAN version 77 compressed? (PC)

I have received copies of SCAN version 77, some with the authentic
verification still intact.  All show the same file size and validation
codes, and match that in the documentation.  I have checked it out
with other virus scanners.  (All right, I'm paranoid.  In this
business, what else is new?)

SCAN 75 was about 80K, but 77 is 59K.  Aryeh has said that Virucide is
compressed.  Is SCAN now compressed as well?

(I would have asked Aryeh, but her return-path doesn't work for me.)

It sounds like you are exiting to DOS from Windows to run SCAN, and
have a file running under Windows.  You can either exit Windows and
then run SCAN, or shut down the Solitaire program and then run SCAN.
Alternatively, you can run SCAN with the /UNATTEND option which will
install a critical error handler that will allow SCAN to automatically
select "Fail" when it comes across a file in use.  I would recommend
that if you use the /UNATTEND option, you also use the /REPORT option
so that you will have a record of any files that were skipped.

This worries me. Could somebody explain what good the PKUNZIP
authentication system should be, as it obviously isn't providing
enough warning here. (Who would know, and think of looking at, the
serial number? Probably few people).

Subject: PC Virus Index(PC)

In response to the many queries which now appear on Virus-L asking for
specific information about particular viruses, I have uploaded the PC
Virus Index to the MIBSRV "official" anti-viral archives.

The PC Virus Index (PCVI) is developed and maintained by Bryan Clough
(of Clough and Partners) with whose permission it is being made
available. PCVI is a text-linked database about PC viruses which is
delivered through an 'intelligent' front-end.  It provides an ever
developing knowledge base about viruses as they emerge. Updated
versions are issued about monthly.

Search keys (including virus name or alias, family attribution, code
size, type and other characteristics) can be used to construct a
profile about any specified virus. The reports generated selectively
include:

 -  a summary description of the effects of infection
 -  disinfection methods
 -  the efficacy of some popular anti-viral software
 -  a detailed report on the characteristics of the virus(es)

The user interface is presently being re-designed to give greater
flexibility for the introduction of new features. Constructive comment
about the utility of PCVI or the direction of its future development
are always welcome.

     I'm not entirely sure, but with some (.ZIP) sfx archives, can't
   you specify "-v" to get the list w/o extracting and "xxx.xxx" to
   extract only one file?  I think that I have used this technique
   with PKZ110.EXE - I only wanted the ZIP and UNZIP executables.

     Not entirely sure though - I haven't checked this yet.

  For now, if it's really bothering you, I've got what seems a
reasonable solution: use Frisk's F-Prot (or any other package you like
that has an external list of nasties) and edit the SIGN.TXT file to
remove those signatures that you deem ridiculous.
  Simple, no?  Granted, it's no solution to the authors of antiviral
software, but from the user perspective it works.
