Subject: AF/91 - John Gantz "joke" in Infoworld

In the April 1, 1991 issue of Infoworld, John Gantz in his column
"Tech Street" warned of a virus called "AF/91" which he said was
developed by the NSA to be used against Iraqui defense computers.
After describing the virus and telling that it started spreading
uncontrolled, he told that windowing technology was "doomed."

In the same issue, columnist Robert Cringely discussed Windows 3.0
vulnerability to viruses saying it "has lots of holes for custom
viruses to slip through."

In the April 8 issue, Mr. Gantz's column begins with a note from the
Editors saying AF/91 was all an April Fools joke.

I'm not laughing.

I'm searching for the adjectives to describe this irresponsible
act.

Anyone else spend time investigating this virus from the 4/1 columns?

I'm *seriously* considering a class action suit for compensatory
(small $) and punitive (BIG $$$) damages.

Interested in hearing from others.

Subject: New virus (PC) ? ("evil empire")

Has anyone else found a DOS boot sector virus that gives an eight line
message about the USA being the real "evil empire" in the "impending
war with Iraq"?  It is on several of our more public computers at U of
Alberta, and we are wondering whether it was locally written.

The virus is a "new stoned" variant, according to the F-DISINF and
F-SYSCHK programs.

Please notify myself, and also Peter Johnston.  Peter is at

Subject: Re: virus infection by inserting a floppy (Mac)

I can only provide an answer for Macs.
It is possible, and in fact there is a virus called "WDEF" which uses this
method. This virus infects the invisible Desktop file which resides on every
floppy and hard disk. This file is examined by the Finder when the floppy is
mounted and the virus resource gets loaded into memory.
On the other hand there are a lot of anti virus tools (commercial and free)
which address this problem an wipe out all known viruses that use this
method. One of them (called SAM Intercept) can be configureds to scan every
floppy that is inserted into the Mac, and will give you an alert and the
option to kill the virus.
Since the invisible Desktop file will not be used in System 7.0, i can+t
say, if viruses will be able to infect Macs running with System 7.0.

I hope this helps

	HOLD IT!  IF he uses his computer only as a terminal then he
is safe.  However, it is not clear that is what he does.

	He mentions USENET and UUCP.  He says that he initiates the
call to exchange email and netnews.  He says that the port is not
enabled for login.  That implies to me that he is running his own Unix
machine and uses UUCP to send and receive email and netnews.  That
means that he is transferring files.  Even worse it means that he
allows "rmail" and "rnews" to be remotely executed on his machine.  I
don't know what software and version he is running, but it is possible
that there may be deliberate or accidental trapdoors in that software.
Just after the Internet worm incident, there was some discussion on
whether or not something similiar to the sendmail or fingerd attack
could take place via UUCP.  I don't remember the conclusion, but I
wouldn't want to guarantee that he is safe.  If he is concerned,
taking a few minutes to look at the source code for "rmail" and
"rnews" would not be unreasonable.

Well, with the same limitations on "details," and without commenting
on SNEFRU, the following may be helpful.

The DEA is an iterative system.  There is a demonstration (Adelman?)
that its strength goes up rapidly with the number of iterations, such
that at sixteen (the number required by the standard) its strength
reaches the point where an analytic attack is as expensive as an
exhaustive attack against the key.  (My recollection is that Adelman
was attempting to demonstrate the power of his analytic attack rather
than the strength of the algorithm.)

Hellman set out to demonstrate the general inadequacy of the length of
the 56 bit DES key; in the process he demonstrated its adequacy for
many applications.  I have always been grateful to him for his
explication of the work required to break it, which is, conversely, a
measure of its strength.  (It should be noted that while the length of
the key in the DES is specified to be 56 bits, the effective key
length in DEA implementations is arbitrarily long.  For example, IBM
uses a 112 bit key in some applications.)

While recovering a great deal of ENIGMA encoded traffic, ULTRA
demonstrated that, with reasonable key management, ENIGMA is a
formidable mechanism.

Anything hit with a sufficiently large hammer will fall to pieces.
The cost of the hammer is a measure of the strength of the thing.  If
the cost of the attack exceeds the value of its success, then the
thing is economically unbreakable.  For most purposes, that is good
enough.

Subject: Unix and viruses (UNIX)

>a.  That MS-Dos viruses (is this an all-encompassing term for things
>that tamper with and destroy the OS and programs?)

Perhaps, yes, but inappropriately so.  True viruses are a special case.

>have conceptual
>parallels in the Unix o/s.  i.e. the kernel is equivalent to

Not true.  There are no successful live viruses in the Unix environment.

There are four necessary conditions for the success of a virus: 1)
(very) large population of similar machines; 2) sharing among members
of that population; 3) the ability of the user to execute an arbitrary
program of his own choice; 4) storage into which write a modified
executable.  Unix does not appear to meet conditions 1 and/or 2.

Other Trojan Horse attacks might be aimed at a specific Unix machine;
these would be several orders of magnitude less serious than a
successful virus.

>b. That all "security" to read and write as a superuser has already
>been breached and that this breach has gone undetected.

Viruses and all other Trojan Horse attacks rely upon user privileges
for their success.  There is no requirement to bypass security.

In fact, a virus that depended for its success on such a condition,
clearly would not meet condition 1 above.

On the other hand, if your b. is the case, then viruses and other
Trojan Horse attacks are the least of your concerns.  Viruses are
Trojan Horses that wish to spread their influence.  Trojan Horses are
attacks against good security.  In the absence of good security,
neither is indicated or necessary.

>c. That one workstation with a bootable hard disk is accessible to the
>individual planning to damage the system.

This condition is easily met in the MS-DOS environment; much less so
in in the Unix environment.  (You should note that viruses depend upon
the fact that the same program will run in all systems in the target
environment.  While one can conceive of a virus that might spread from
an MS-DOS workstation to a Unix workstation or multi-user system (if
that is what you have in mind), it is highly unlikely that such a
program would meet the conditions for success.)

While some kinds of Trojan Horse attacks might target such a device,
viruses are aimed at the population as a whole rather than to any
specific machine.

>d. That the individual is sufficiently sophisticated to avoid leaving
>obvious clues (file sizes, dates, etc.).

Well, that excludes all viruses.  It is possible to conceive of a
virus that was so subtle that it left no evidence; on the other hand,
if you never notice that you have been damaged, then you have not been
damaged.

No such virus has ever been detected, for obvious reasons.  All the
reported viruses have done something noticeable.  Since the intent of
a virus is to spread, and since if it has no symptoms, the author
cannot know if it is successful, few people would write such a virus.

>e. We should consider that the individual may have access to the o/s
>source code.

I assume that you mean that an attacker would have special knowledge
of the operating system, since if he has WRITE access to such code, no
other attack is necessary.

While it is likely that some virus authors have such special
knowledge, few exploit it and, since viruses need only exploit user
privileges, it is neither necessary nor even particularly useful.

>I am particularly interested in comments about:
>
>a.  Known attacks on Unix o/s involving tampering with the o/s kernel
>and commands.

Indeed, you may well be.  (Of course, attacks against the kernel are
substantively different from those involving commands.)  Given the
mode of operation of many Unix systems, sophisticated attacks are
rarely needed.  I suggest that you read Ken Thompson's Turing Award
lecture and Cliff Stoll's "The Cuckoo's Egg."  They have already
recorded far more than I am likely to tell you.

Your statement indicates that what you have is FPROT.  If you have
been given only the F-FCHK program, you do not have the full package,
as SIGN.TXT is included in it.  The file FPROT114.ZIP should contain
the entire suite, and is available on many servers and local bulletin

Actually, your question, even as specific as you have made it (and
thank you for all the details you *have* given) is not completely
straightforward.

First point: what is your local machine?  If it is a PC, and you are
using it just as a terminal, you should be almost completely safe.  I
say "almost", because there are instances of codes imbedded in text
that can gain "access" to the low levels of your machine, but they
would be very much subject to the specific terminal program you are
using, and the configuration both of it and of your PC.  As these
codes have so far been seen only in "trojan" situations, and given the
configuration specific nature, this is highly unlikely to be of
concern to you.

If you are using a workstation, and connecting in a network or
pseudonetwork configuration (I am extrapolating from your comment
about the port not being enabled for a login) you may possibly be at
greater risk

If you are simply using a terminal, you may still be subject to a
"denial of access" viral situation, although you would be safe from
local data loss.  Some terminals (and I won't go into details because
they are available in back issues of VIRUS-L) will accept text as
commands to "remap" the keybaord, and then to "send" the remapped
commands.  These "new" commands can, of course, be of the nature of
"forward this message to everyone I know", and thus create a mail
virus.

The last few issues of Information Week have published scattered
excerpts of a study by Certus International.  Although no details of
methodology are given, beyond the statement that 150 corporations were
surveyed, they state that 26% of companies were hit by an infection
(on one or more PC's) in January of 1991.  Over half of the companies
had been affected at one time.

Certus is also stating that the problem (in terms of number of
infections) is growing at the rate of 160% per quarter.

The figures may be inflated by "self selection" factors, or they may
be lowered because of privacy concerns.

A Suggestion for your "possible HyperCard virus."  Running 6.0.5 on
those Macs suggests to me that you may be running into a heap-stack
collision.  If you are running a moderate number of INITs, you may
wish to get Heap Tool (available at Sumex).  This adjusts the size of
your heap upwards, avoiding such collisions.  Write back with any

Subject: Virus in disk-validator (Amiga)

A disk which contained a virus-killer I needed because of the
'Noname'-virus, also contained a very nasty virus (!). It was located
in the 'disk-validator' program in the L directory. This one is a real
problem, because you don't even have to boot from an infected disk or
run a program! Just insert it in any drive and it will put itself in
memory. A friend of mine said that this was because of a bug in
Kickstart, because when a disk is damaged somehow (by this virus for
example), the disk-validator on this disk is used, and not the one in
L:.

I don't know for sure what this virus does, except writing itself to
any disk inserted. I DO know how to identify it: VirusX4.0 says that
"The Australian Parasite virus" was found in memory and the
ColdCapture pointer was altered. After that, VirusX says it has
removed it from memory, but actually it's still there. You can easily
check if your disk-validator has been infected: just 'type opt h
df1:l/disk-validator' (for example) will do. The normal disk-validator
contains a lot of text (several errors), whereas the virus only has
the text 'Checksum error' at the end.  You can't see the difference
from the size of the disk-validator.

So, is it a new virus? Which virus-killer can recognize this one and
future versions? And where can I find it?

Yes,

On the macintosh, WDEF spreads quite nicely on insertion of a floppy.  Any
virus which infects the desktop file will likely infect on disk insertion.

Boot sector infectors that grab Int 13 do this backwards: The virus takes
13 from the BIOS but when DOS loads, the vector is repointed to DOS and
after its check, a far call is made to the previous vector (virus).
Joshi & Stoned look like this after DOS loads.

I am not sure about this. A good integrity management system will be able to
block anything that tries to take power after DOS but an BSI has the
opportunity to go resident on any accidental boot. Unless a BIOS level checker
is in place (like my experiment), this can be very difficult to detect given
some techniques we (thankfully) have not seen, yet.

I think you are talking about the Master Boot Record (aka Partition Table),

I use DEBUG to do this all the time - the necessary code fragment is:

     MOV AX,201
     MOV BX,200
     MOV CX,1
     MOV DX,80
     INT 13
     INT 20

After execution, the MBR will reside in locations 200h-3ffh for you to
store in a .DAT file. Restoration just requires changing one byte.

If you want the DOS Boot Record, "L 200 2 0 1" will put that in the same
location.

If you have a number of similar machines, all partitioned the same way,
you should find that the MBR and BR are the same between machines (no
guarentees though). A good tech should be able to rebuild a lost MBR in
about 15 minutes if the drive is known & familiar.

Entirely true, though it is more difficult to get one to spread in a
properly implimented (managerial problem NOT technical) unix
environment than in DOS.

Given access, unix will take care of the structure of a file header,
etc.  provided the unix virus uses properly implimented high level
calls. The low level stuff (under the OS) found in many DOS viruses is
rather difficult to impliment. The unix access controls are adequate
against this type of attack are adequate (viruses are possible but
worms or spoofs are easier).

This is a possibility but the infection process would have to be a bit
convoluted - a spoof would be simpler. You would have to invoke a "cut
and paste" operation to infect other scripts and write or root access
would be required. The main difficulty would be that script files are
readable, kind of like patching AUTOEXEC.BAT in DOS & easy to detect
(if anyone looks).  Would also be limited to legal commands (annoying
but not likely to be permanently destructive).

In the VAX world, use of version numbers in file calls (does anyone
else ?)  would make such script spoofs more difficult.

Key here is that "good" multi-user systems (e.g. unix) already have
good defense mechanisms built in but rarely used.

THis sounds more like a corrupted stack than a virus. Your user may
want to (okay, *need* to) copy the old cards into a new stack. There's
a stack called "Cheesy Recovery" on sumex (I think) that should do the
job.

Yes. There are several Mac viruses which take advantage of a feature
in the operating systenm which allows you to substitute your own code
for system code. The substitute code spreads via a resource file which
the Finder always opens when a disk is inserted.

____________________________________________________________________________
                               Call for Papers

             Third Workshop on Computer Security Incident Handling
____________________________________________________________________________


Location and Dates:

Hyatt Dulles                                     August 6-8, 1991
At Dulles International Airport
Herndon, Virginia


Description:

The Third Workshop on Computer Security Incident Handling will consist
of tutorials, invited addresses, paper sessions, and workshop/
discussion sessions on topics relevant to responding to computer
security incidents. The presentations will provide a forum to discuss
advances in theory and practice that improve the state of this field.
Theoretical, applied, tutorial, or descriptive papers selected for
presentation will appear in the conference proceedings to be published
after the Workshop.  The Third Workshop on Computer Security Incident
Handling is sponsored by Carnegie Mellon University's Software
Engineering Institute.  Submissions are solicited for the following
sessions:

Tutorials (half-day):

Tutorials should cover topics such as network security and
methodologies/strategies for incident handling.  The purpose of each
tutorial should be to allow someone who has little or no knowledge
about incident handling to learn the basic issues/concepts in this
arena.

Paper Sessions:

Proposals for paper sessions (approximately 30 minutes in length)
should address one of the following areas:

   o Network intrusions (including case studies, etiologies, and
       intrusion detection efforts)
   o Vendor activities
   o Procedures and policies for responding to incidents
   o Threats (including threat and attack models, descriptions of
       coordinated efforts to intrude into networks, and cracking tools)
   o Legal issues
   o Tools
   o Vulnerabilities and malicious code
   o Ethical issues

Workshops (half-day):

Proposals to lead workshop sessions covering topics such as network
security, relationships between incident response teams, and lessons
learned from responding to incidents are also solicited.

Submissions:

Proposals should be 300 - 500 words in length. Please do not send
submissions that are significantly shorter or longer.  Papers must not
have been previously presented or published, nor currently submitted
for journal publication. Each manuscript will be submitted to a
rigorous refereeing process.  Proposals should have a title page that
includes the title of the paper, full name of its author(s),
affiliation(s), complete physical and electronic address(es), telephone
number(s), and a 300-500 word description of the purpose and major
ideas to be presented.

Deadlines:

May 17, 1991
Deadline for receipt of proposal

June 7, 1991
