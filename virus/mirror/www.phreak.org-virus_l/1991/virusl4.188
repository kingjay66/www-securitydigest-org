VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: Virus-writing course for teenagers

  I was looking through the syllabus of a science-for-youth program
which is due to start next month.  The courses on computers include:
  Grades
    5-6    Intro. to computers, Logo, Pascal
    7-8    Pascal, Assembler, AI, Graphics
   9-12    Above four courses plus Data Structures, C, Supercomputers,
           Defenses against Viruses.

Looks pretty good, until you read the description of the course on
Assembler.  This is a literal translation:

    You already know Basic?  You already know Pascal?  What do you
    still lack in order to analyze the brain of the computer? - Assem-
    bler.  In this language you'll be able to acquire tools for things
    which cannot be done in any other language, like: how to 'create
    viruses', how to write protection programs and how to crack them.

  Needless to say, the matter has been brought to the attention of the
program director, and it is expected that the above applications will
not actually get mentioned when the course is presented.  It has also
been suggested that part of each course be devoted to a discussion of
computer offenses and rules of ethics.  (I would also hope that the
instructor who suggested the above applications be replaced, though
that's perhaps too much to expect.)

I'm a college student who has been studying viruses for several years
now.  I've now reached the point where I'd like to do some more
theoretical work at a high level...does anyone know of a good source
of some of the classic papers done in the field (works for Cohen and
the like)?  I'm looking for a basis for an independant study and
perhaps an honors thesis for the future.  Thanks!

Subject: Dr. Fred's Contest

I have just had the opportunity to read Dr. Cohen's article from "The
Sciences" and have had a glimmer of how such a "benign" virus might
operate. The key would be "human permission" and such a methodology
might even simplify the "LAN Nightmare" many administrators stay
wakeful over:

Consider the problem of a LAN with a large number of clients that are
not under the control of the administrator. Add in a resident set of
antiviral utilities that protect the LAN such as my DiskSecure, which
uses stealth and integrity management but loads only on request and
which replaces hard and floppy disk boot sectors with itself, but
again only on user request. At this point it is a program not a virus
since it does not propagate (some like replicate, but propagate is
more definative).

Now consider that all of the software is site licensed for use on any
node on the LAN (no pirates here !).

Next, consider that the administrator requires that this software be
in use on all PCs connected to the LAN, and goes one step further:
uses the LOGIN script file to validate that all clients are running
the required software. Still within the realm of common defense
measures we have discussed on virus-l.

The major diversion occurs if the LOGIN script determines that the
required management safeguards are NOT in place on the client
requesting connection and the script then gives the client the choice
of having the software (which includes a mix of TSRs and replacement
MBR and boot records) installed on his/her machine or being denied
access. If the INSTALL option is selected, does the subsequent action
fulfill the requirements of a "virus" ? e.g. propagation to a platform
that was not known at the time the program "set" (executables and
script files) was installed.

Since the new client then has the ability to make my special
"maintenance" disks, unique to his PC, there is at least one following
propagation stage.

(anyone know where I can get an entry form, the prize would cover a
new Bernoulli Transportable & script files are easy to write).

The Azusa virus was also found in Long Beach State University Lab,
SCAN and CLEAN found it, HOWEVER, VSHIELD doesn't seem to be able to

Subject: Books on viruses?

Surely there must have been a good book published recently about
viruses - the basics.  I really don't know much about them, but would
like to learn.  I'm rather new to the world of networks, but I know
that I'm hooked for life.  I have gathered that the risks of
networking can be significant when working on these networks.

Anyway, to protect my system, I'd like to know a bit about viruses:
how they work, how to protect/defeat them, etc.

Any suggestions?

Many sincere thanks...

 Yes, a single virus would be unwieldy.  But should we expect that?
 Shouldn't we rather expect the prompt appearance of many viruses,
 each one capable of attacking one of those systems?  The net result
 would be similar to having one virus capable of attacking all of them.
 Worse actually, since it would require many times the effort to guard
 against.

 All our experience shows us that devising virus-specific defenses,
 or `distributing' defenses in the hope of diluting the effort of
 virus authors, is ineffective. It only causes proliferation of new
 `species'. We can't outwrite them.  This is one reason why scanners
 are bad, and this is also why every other taxon-specific approach
 is bad.

 Any thinking that aims at resisting viruses by combating them as
 individual entities, or any measure that aims at creating specific
 defenses against only one group of viruses, is likely to continue
 being ineffective. For this reason, the idea that creating many
 firmware variations will help stop viruses is, in my opinion, also
 unlikely to work. There will simply be more viruses.

 If any proof is needed, just look at the field. We have more
 antivirus utilities than ever. There are more defense variations
 than ever. There are also more viruses than ever. They infect more
 machines than ever.

 Taxon-specific antivirus measures have proven generally ineffective.
 Such measures are quickly overcome by new, ever more ingenious
 viruses.  What's needed is a general defense.  Such a defense can
 more likely be obtained by pure hardware means than by software
 means.

Well, not quite.  The Supreme Court has the right to pick and choose
the cases that it thinks important enough to spend it's limited time
on.  There are a lot of cases that ask the Court for consideration and
only a very limited number actually get looked at.  What you said
above only means the Court didn't want to deal with it right now.
IMHO this is only because they don't see some computer case as near as
important as many of the others.  They can decide to hear another
computer case in the future and probably will when it appears
important.  Until then, the only thing that can be said is that the
Court hasn't said anything about it.  There has been no interpretation
because the Court hasn't even looked at it.

I've seen a number of TSR's (one I think from PC Magazine?) that allow
you to "turn off" Ctrl/break, ctrl/c & ctrl/alt/del.

I've also written a shell for McAfee's viruscan that executes it with
the "/NOBREAK" parameter the first time it is run on a given day.  It's
freeware & available on my BBS [(516) 483-5841, N,8,1, 300-2400 + 9600
HST].  I could try to send it UUencoded, but I think it exceeds
CompuServe's message size limit.

Now that I got QEMM 6, I can finally load vshield in UMB (initially
needs about 110K, but then goes down to 35K). How do I know that it is
working up there without actually getting my system infected??? I wish
vshield had some sort of on-line command so I can see if it responds.
Does vshield (v82) work right in UMBs? Will a new one come out (to

Hi Tom!

I'm a Computer Operator at the University of South Australia.  I think
the virus you are looking for is called Azusa.  We have just had a
huge infection accross the whole of our Underdale campus.  The source
was traced to a number of high school students illegally playing
pirated games in one of the student pools.  McAfees latest V82
utilities (available on comp.binaries.ibm.pc) will cope with it.

Hope it helps.

Cheers,

It won't take long before somebody makes this extension. With it I
think we will be able to get rid of the virus problem on PCs. Not
because the system will be completely fool-proof, but the entrance
level should be high enough to stop the majority of todays virus
writers.

In early 1980 I remember reading about 'worm' research at Xerox PARC.
After reading that I went and hacked a couple of (what we now would
call boot sector) viruses for an Apple ][.  This was in 1980 so
certainly the concepts were known and experimented with in the 70's.

If anyone has information or references about the PARC work I would be
curious to read about it again.

PS in an ironic misnomer I called my virus a 'worm' after the PARC
   ones I was trying to emulate on a personal computer.

Subject: Re: DIR II (Cluster) Virus (PC)

A question of terminology follows:

In private discussion with turtle (Fred Waller) he raises this point
about the DIR 2 virus:

    It's not a worm, it's not a virus, but it's a virus that is a worm.
    I think we have to revise definitions, rather than insist that virus
    writers conform to the definitions that we have accepted <g>.

In my collection of terms I define virus and worm thus:

    virus - a piece of code that is executed as part of another program
	and can replicate itself in other programs.  The analogy to real
	viruses is pertinent ("a core of nucleic acid, having the ability to
	reproduce only inside a living cell").  Most viruses on PCs really are
	viruses.

    worm - A self-replicating, autonomous program (or set of programs)
	that can replicate itself, usually over a network.  A worm is a
	complete program by itself unlike a virus which is part of another
	program.  Robert Morris's program, the Internet Worm, is an example of
	a worm although it has been mistakenly identified in the popular media
	as a virus.

My claim is that DIR 2 can legitimately be called a virus since it is
logically still part of another program and relies on a host program
being run in order to get an execution thread.

Comments and discussion are welcome.

Subject: Response re DIET (PC)

I apologize for any `off-topicness'(?) of this post - won't pursue
 it further. However, some replies were received here regarding a
 comment I made on DIET, the excutable compressor that uses viral
 techniques for good purpose, and I'd like to respond briefly:

 Writes pshuang@athena.mit.edu (Ping Huang):

 > I find it interesting that DIET has branched out in function as

 > purpose on-the-fly disk compressor such as Stacker or DoubleDisk,

 Well, STACKER and other commercial systems, including the ExpanZ
 card, etc., encrypt the entire disk volume. They are not equivalent
 to Matsumoto's DIET v1.10a, which compresses individual files,
 chosen on the fly by the user, and which can coexist with non-
 compressed files.  DIET files remain DOS files and may be copied,
 renamed, transferred to another system and decompressed there, etc.
 Also, DIET has some inherent intelligence and will not try to
 compress again files that are already compressed, such as archives,
 or smaller than one disk allocation unit.

 I wasn't familiar with the DCOMPRESS program, so I went and
 downloaded its source code before posting this reply. I found that
 DCOMPRESS is a rather different animal from DIET: it requires that
 the user prepare ahead of time special ASCII files for each
 subdirectoruy, listing files to be excluded, requires that a
 separate utility (PCMANAGE) be used to compress the files also
 ahead of time, and has other requirements, including the need to
 change the system date by one week, then run PCMANAGE, then reset
 the system date back again, etc., which render it much less elegant
 and more difficult to use than DIET.  I intend no offense against
 DCOMPRESS' author, but DCOMPRESS is not equivalent to DIET v1.10a.

 Thus, I repeat that the functionality offered by DIET v1.10a is
 not found in any other program that I know.  Its usefulness and
 functionality are achieved, to an important extent, by the use
 of what might be termed `virus programming techniques'.

 Just now, I'm taking a quick first look at v1.20 of DIET, which
 has even more interesting features.

In VIRUS-L Volume 4 Issue 186, I announced the availability of
Vesselin Bontchev's paper, "The Bulgarian and Soviet Virus Factories"
in both TeX and ASCII formats on our anonymous FTP archive,
cert.sei.cmu.edu.  As it turns out, the ASCII version was garbled
(due, I'm sure, to my lack of TeXpertise).  I've replaced the ASCII
file with a PostScript file which appears to be (at least) better, and
I removed the ASCII file from the archive.

If any avid TeX user out there cares to take the time to properly
format the paper into an ASCII document, I would be happy to replace
the .doc file.  It would be most appreciated!

Sorry for any inconvenience.
