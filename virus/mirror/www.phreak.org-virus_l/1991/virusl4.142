  Recently, I was also given a disk from a friend that was infected
with the LIBERTY virus. I am also having the same problem trying to
remove it....  If anyone has any idea of cleaning or removing it
without replacing the infected files please kindly let me know.

  I appreciate any help that is available.

Subject: When can a virus infect (AMIGA)

With ZEROVIRUS running, after booting from a TC500 hard drive, I ran
across a newly acquired disk which, upon being inserted, resulted in:

ZeroVirus gave a warning "ColdCapture has been changed!"

options: retry  clear

choosing clear resulted in the warning coming back up in about 1/10 second.

I did a cold start, then switched to VIRUSX...

Upon inserting the suspect disk, VirusX warned: Australian Parasite
detected!

Choosing clear seemed to work, since VirusX went back to sleep. I was
under the impression that a boot-block virus could only start-up if
you booted from an infected disk, not by simple insertion?

When will Australian Parasite be documented in the brunnstein files?

This signature was defined before I started as the Technical editor,
so I am only indirectly responsible for it, but I don't quite
understand what you mean by "..you would not find it."  The signature
string is present in all infected .EXE files too - and just look for
the virus in one fixed location does not look very sensibfle to me.

Subject: Mutation engine available (PC)

The person who calls himself Dark Avenger - the author of the "Eddie"
virus (and others), has just released a "mutation engine" - a skeleton
for constructing encrypted self-modifying viruses.  This program has
been posted in source code form on several virus BBSes, and although
it is not as sohisticated as expected, I would not be surprised if
several viruses build around it would apper in the next few months.

Subject: Hard disk locking ? (PC)

One person here at the University of Iceland had the misfortune of
having his hard disk trashed by the Spanish Telecom virus recently.
It was possible to trace the source of the infection, but now he wants
some method to prevent anyone from working on his machine while he is
away - for example by asking for a password on boot-up.

This is easily solvable with additional hardware - some machines
include this feature in the BIOS, but it is also possible to get an
add-in card for this purpose.

Software-only solutions are less secure of course, but they are
sufficient in his case.  It is possible to create a small program
which asks for a password when you boot from the hard disk, and cannot
be bypassed simply by booting from a diskette.

My questions:

     #1 I guess that such a program already exists - but I have not yet
        been able to find it.  Does anyone know of something like this ?

     #2 If the answer to #1 is "no", I'll probably write this, and might
        make it available if anybody is interested.  The question is - are
        programs like this a good idea ?  I can imagine some potential
        problems, for example if the hard disk is "protected" in this way,
        without the owner's permission, and if a utility to remove the
        protection is included, it really makes the program rather useless.

Well - it would be interesting to run it against a larger set -
containing 400-800 viruses or so.  In particular, I would be
interested in seeing how it performs against a similar program of my
own, as I have not been able to obtain anything better than a 95%
detection.  Programs like this are not new - I saw one (Russian or
Bulgarian) in Hamburg last December.  This type of anti-virus programs
has a problem with viruses written in a high-level language, but they
are very efficient in finding most instances of suspicious code.
However - the number of false positives may be unacceptable in many
cases.

Subject: NEW VIRUS? (PC)

I want to now if anybody out there has notices or sighths about the HV32 FAKKIR
 virus (PC).

This virus, attacks faster and, unfortunatedly, effective, it can destroy in me
mory the SCAN anti-virus program, an then attacks, as i saw, it seems that the
SCANning process is the activator for the virus actions, i'm not sure about
that.

The way in that he does is as follows:

1.- SCAN detects the virus in memory, then it sends and alert, saying that some
thing strange is happening in the computer's memory, and migth want to turn it
off.

2.- A bozo message appears on the screen saying: "I'm killing the &%$,@... poli
ce program ..."

3.- The speaker beeps uncontrolled

4.- You turn off and on again your machine

5.- You discover that all your files, including those on the sub-directories, h
as been converted to a 144 byte file that contains the message "Fakkir has %$,&
@ this Go-Go file... Ha, Ha, Ha"

It seems that the virus works while the speaker is beeping, so, the faster you
reboot your machine, the more files you prevent from attack.

I was searching for signatures, boot sectors, or any other clue for try to figu
re-out how the virus works, but the attack was very faster, and lethal.

If anybody out there has notices about this abomination, please answer.

Thanks in advance.

Subject: Re: 8 Tunes

Hello,
  the 8 tunes virus is most probably a german product. It plays 8 tunes
after going resident, provided the infection is 90 or more days old.
The virus will wait for 30 min and then start playing randomly selected
tunes of it's repertoire. Four are german folk, songs two are english songs,
one is garbage, and the last is part of the virus TSR interpreted as
music (garbage too).
  Sincerely
     Christoph Fischer

P.S.: I presume you have the other technical details, if not let me
      know.

Nope, not a thing. I suspect that there just are not enough installations
of OS/2 yet, in those areas where virus writers tend to be. When we
looked into the possibility of writing viruses for OS/2 we found
many facinating possibilities, I wont go into here. But, like the
MAC operating system, OS/2 has better self-protection and is far
more complicated to program. I doubt not that we will see an OS/2
virus some day.

Or you could just destroy the checksum as the Tequila virus did to the

The file below looks strange - but it contains the PKZIPed, xxencoded
comments by Dark Avenger which were included in his new "mutation
engine".

Normally I would ask Vesselin Bontchev for a translation, as the text
is probably in Bulgarian, but I have not been able to reach him.  So,
if there is anybody reading this who...

       ... can display the Cyrillic character set on his/her PC.
and
       ... understands Bulgarian

I would really appreciate a quick translation, as I am planning to write
a bit about this engine for the September edition of the Virus Bulletin.

Subject: Re: Bus Error, Teenager Abuse (Mac)

Bus errors are not always bus errors.  What I mean by that is that to
me a bus error suggests a hardware problem, which in my experience has
been rarely the case.  Typically the error is caused by an INIT/CDEV
conflict that the user is not aware of.  I have had similar problems
with a specific Mac in my balliwick (I'll kill Stoll if I ever meet
him - can't stop using that word...)  with CDEV transfers back and
forth.  They should try disabling/removing various INITs and CDEVs one
by one and performing the operation.  Then they will probably find out
what was the cause.

The second most common cause of bus errors (in the low numbers) is a
memory problem.  Typically this will arise if the SIMM wasn't inserted
right, or if it has (once in an eclipse that YOU experience) gone bad.

Subject: HELP - possible virus (IBM 5150?)

   I think I may have a virus, but I'm not sure.  I have an old IBM
model 5150.  Recently, it has been acting weird.  Its running a lot
slower and some files won't run at all.  It has been getting
progressively worse.  A file I ran yesterday won't run anymore today.
Also, the longer its on, the slower it gets.  After ten minutes, its
so slow that I can see lines between screen flashes.  I have been
using my modem to call BBS's and check out files, so its possible that
I picked up a virus somewhere.  I got a copy of Mc so and so's virus
scan program.  When I ran it, it said that I had a Jerusalem virus on
about 25 files.

   Can anyone help me?  I don't want to start cleaning my hard drive
unless I'm sure that I need to.  I'm rather a novice when it comes to
computers, and I would appreciate any help or advice that anyone has.
Please e-mail me with any suggestions.
