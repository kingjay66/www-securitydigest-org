> What is special about stealth viruses?  Why are they called "stealth"?

Every virus makes changes to executable code; hence all viruses can be
detected by checking all executable code in a system for discrepancies
between presumed and actual contents. A stealth virus camouflages the
changes it has made from detection by other programs, usually by
monitoring the system functions used by programs to read files or
physical blocks from storage media, and forging the results of such
system functions suitably.

Example: One of the oldest MS-DOS Viruses, Brain, a boot sector infector,
monitors physical disk-I/O and re-directs any attempt to read a Brain-
infected boot sector to the disk area where the original boot sector is
stored.

Countermeasures: To gain unadulterated access to storage media, a "clean"
system is needed so that no virus is present to interfere with its oper-
ation. Hence the system should be built from a trusted, clean master copy
before any virus-checking is attempted; this is "The Golden Rule of the
Trade". With MS-DOS, (1) boot from original DOS diskettes (i.e. DOS
Startup/Program diskettes from a major vendor that have been write-
protected since their creation), (2) use only tools from original
diskettes until virus-checking has completed.

Subject: re: Password Program

	First off, a PC cannot execute from CMOS memory, it can only
store data there (and requires special commands to do it). Thus while
a password may be STORED there, it cnnot be EXECUTED from there. Hence
the code invoking the password must be "somewhere else". The most
likely bet is that you have a COMPAQ, NEC, TANDON, ZENITH or some
other BIOS that incorporates a password protection and it has somehow
gotten turned on (oh yes, PS/2's also). When off, you never see it.

	The most generic means to recover is to record the disk and
memory information from CMOS, then with the system turned off,
interrupt the power to the CMOS (e.g. pull the battery) and bring the
system back up from an installation floppy that will allow you to
reset the CMOS values.

ps, a dying battery could also conceivably cause these symptoms.

Subject: Bad Sectors (was Possible Virus) (PC)

	The symptoms match those of a few viruses (notably MusicBug) but
there is a fairly simple check that will help.

	Simply put, bad sectors are allocated in tracks not sectors while
DOS allocates information on a hard disk in clusters consequently, "bad"
sectors are reported in fairly sizable quanta.

	Different drive architectures allocate different numbers of sectors
per track from 17 (11h) for most MFM and IDE drives), to 26 (1Ah) for non-
translated RLL drives, all the way up to 63 (3Fh) for some large drives usu.
EDSI.

	The key here is that the quanta is fixed: a single bad track on most
MFM drives will result in 10240 "bad" bytes on a drive using 2k clusters, two
bad tracks will give 20480 "bad" bytes, and this will increase as an even
multiple of 10240 bytes.

	The equation is simple: divide the number of sectors per track (17)
by the number of sectors per cluster (4) = (4.25) round up to the next
integer (Dos can't break up clusters) (=5) and multiply by bytes per
cluster (2048). The same technique can be used for different sizes (e.q.
RLL drive with 26 sectors & cluster size of 4096 bytes-8 sectors/cluster &
512 bytes per sector - a few are 1024 but most fixed disks use 512 bytes per
sector - 26/8=3.25 round to 4 * 4096 = 16384 bytes per "bad" track.

	Consequently, if an ST 251-1 (42 mb MFM) reports 40960 bytes in
"bad" sectors (10240 x 4), it does not bother me, but if I see 7168 bytes
reported bad, alarum bells go off.

						Padgett

     BTW we went through this last year some time - Anthony ?

ps CHKDSK will usually return the number of bytes/cluster (allocation units)
   and if you AND the CX return from Int 13 Fn 8 with 3Fh, the CX value will
   be the "apparent" number of sectors per track. Have phun.

I don't believe this to be a problem, especially if the user is able
to program the checksum functions that is being used. But if you
really want something strong and reasonably fast, why not using MD5
authentification codes?

That would be great! I'll try to write something about our program as
well.

A "stealth" virus is one which..

   ...intercepts open/read operations if it is active in memory, and
      makes infected programs (or boot sectors) look "normal.

and

   ...shows no increase in file size if it is active.

The first ability is the reason it is recommended to boot from a "clean"
floppy before you run a virus scanner.

No, the 1963 virus just happens by chance to contain one of my "Eddie"
signature strings, but the virus still does not look like Eddie, so I
only identified it as a "possible new variant".

I have now updated the program to detect the virus, and 2.02 (to be
released later this month) detects it without problems.

>(2) Why was nothing detected in memory? (- or does the generic scanner only

Nothing was detected, because version 2.01 simply does not identify
1963 - I did not add it because I had not been able to get it to work.
The "Possibly new Eddie" varing is actually a false alarm - caused by
the fact that the author of 1963 borrowed a bit of code from Eddie,
but the viruses are totally unrelated.

The answers are NO, and MAYBE.

The program F-LOCK would detect various types of suspicious activity, such
as attempts to write to executable files and the boot sector.  However, I
decided to drop the programn in version 2.0, for the following reasons:

   Too many viruses were able to bypass it, simply by jumping straight
   into ROM or DOS, bypassing any interrupt-monitoring program like
   F-LOCK, FLUSHOT+ or similar.

   The program was not Windows compatible.

When/if I solve those problems I will release an updated version.  Until
then, you can use F-LOCK/F-POPUP from version 1.16 - just be aware of the
problems.

Subject: Washburn and Ethics

  I had vowed to myself that I wasn't going to submit any more post-
ings on the ethical aspects of Washburn's actions (discussions of
ethics usually generate more heat than light), but after seeing Gene
Spafford's posting, I changed my mind.  I quote from the beginning of
his posting:

>I must agree with Bill Murray.  Releasing *any* compuer virus is an
>unethical act that should be deplored by any responsible professional.

  Tell me, Gene, do you see any place where I have claimed that re-
leasing a virus is *ethical*?  I merely gave counter-considerations
in a particular case in order to show that the situation is not as
black-and-white as some people make it out to be.  Since I never said
that virus releasing is ethical, what you have written above is not an
argument against me.  And I do not disagree with most of your other
statements either.  The main problem with your position is not that
it's incorrect, but that it ignores the counter-considerations which I
presented.
  In the case of Washburn, I was faced with the following dilemma:  A
long time ago I compared the program SECURE against other generic pre-
vention programs and found it to be the best.  (No, that does not mean
that it's *perfect* or that I recommend relying on it *alone*.  I wan-
ted the best generic prevention program as a first line of defense, to
be followed by the best generic detection program as a second line of
defense.)  So I started using it and recommending it to others.  Then
I noticed that the author of SECURE was the same person as the one who
had released the 1260 virus. True, release of even a non-deliberately-
destructive virus is dangerous and unethical (ordinarily; but see re-
mark below).  Still, does that necessarily imply that I should stop
using and recommending SECURE?
  The problem is similar to one which arose from a panel discussion on
Jung which I heard on the radio a couple of days ago.  Most of the
discussion was on relatively "objective" issues, but at the end it was
mentioned that he had cooperated with the Nazis.  Surely that was
unethical.  But does it follow that Jung's psychology should be boy-
cotted because of this?  Some will say Yes, while others will say No.
  In the case of SECURE, I was faced with a similar dilemma.  Ok, what
Washburn did was unethical.  But boycotting Washburn would hardly act
as a deterrent in any similar case since it's highly unlikely that
other authors of anti-viral software would be naive enough to admit to
having written a virus.  Therefore the deterrent power of boycotting
software of known virus writers seems to be nil.  I suspect that the
main motive for the demand to boycott Washburn is simply to get re-
venge on him, and such considerations do not particularly interest me.
I came to the conclusion that the advantage of a good program out-
weighed any benefit gained by punishing Washburn.  I therefore decided
to continue using SECURE and recommending it to the users at my uni-
versity and to anyone else who's interested in my opinion.  Anyone
who thinks otherwise is certainly entitled to his opinion, but please
spare me the ethics lectures for daring to take the position I have
taken.

  Above, I was speaking of specific dilemmas.  If it is hard to make a
decision in these cases, how much harder is it to make *general* ethi-
cal pronouncements, such as you have made in the passage quoted above.
There is hardly a single rule of ethics that most people would not
find it justifiable to violate under certain conditions.  For exam-
ple, it is considered unethical to interfere in the internal affairs
of other countries.  But what if the rulers of the country in question
are committing genocide?  Many would say that interference *is* justi-
fied and ethical in that case.
  I can even think of a case where virus releasing might be consi-
dered ethical by most people.  Suppose we are at war and our intelli-
gence service uses viruses to cause damage to the enemy (who is always
unethical, of course).  Would *such* a use of viruses be unethical?  I
think most people would conclude that in *this* case the answer is No.
So what happens to your above-quoted ethical principle that "releasing
*any* compuer virus is an unethical act that should be deplored by any
responsible professional"?  You might say "Well, I didn't mean it in
*that* sort of case."  So you rephrase your principle so that it
excludes such a case.  But then someone finds another exception, and
so on.  I, on the other hand, am not trying to propose any general
ethical rule.  I judge each case on its own merits.

  As I said a couple of times, this subject has little to do with the
facts, and therefore no one is likely to convince the other side of
his opinion.  This time I'm going to keep my vow not to react to any
further correspondence on this subject.

Good reply, Tim.  However I think that the lack of growth is in no
small part economic, vice societal.  At that, I'm not certain that
any non-proselytizing religion counts grown as "winning".  Likewise
I'd be very suspicious of anyone claiming that Israel's population
growth is a result of their policy of not dealing with kidnapers.

Relative to the computer security community, I wouldn't want to
equate "growth" with "winning".  Like many defensive (some would
say reactionary) groups (DoD, doctors, police, etc.), we'll "win"
the day we're obsolete.  Our goal should be to work ourselves out
of a job.  At that, computer users don't want security; they want
to be left alone!  (What they REALLY want is magic, but that's
another topic).  So none of us need worry too much about finding
jobs in other fields. ;{)

However, the question is not "crime & punishment" or even "philos-
ophy & political science", but "deterrence".  This may sound heret-
ical, but I honestly don't care if a single virus writer is ever
"punished"; I do care very much about effective ways of deterring
them.  The more I've looked into the "punishment" angle, the less
I believe it to be effective.

My thesis is that "shunning", "excommunicating", "putting beyond
the Pale", "banishment", "sending to Coventry", etc. is such a
deterrent.  The "kicker" is that it has to be practiced universally
by the group in question to be an effective deterrent.  ^^^^^^^^^^^

forth - it does not contain detailed information on incident response.
It is written at a fairly high-level, but contains a number of references
