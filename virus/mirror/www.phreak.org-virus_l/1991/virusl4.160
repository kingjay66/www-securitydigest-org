     That doesn't matter at boot time.  At boot time the INT 13h
handlers are in BIOS, and the server software hasn't been loaded yet.
The virus will operate fine, until the server loads.  At the time that
the server attempts to load, it will probably have a problem with
loading up some data.  The reason for this is that the virused often
overwrite needed data areas.  This is all assuming that your server is
loaded from a floppy, of course, and has no DOS area.  If there is a
DOS partition from which the network boots, then the virus will
probably work fine.

    It's clearly possible to INFECT the server, however it's not going
to WORK well.  Since the server rarely (if ever) needs to access a
floppy, it's certainly not going to spread.

    The problem we run across is that the virus *DOES* do some damage
to important data areas on the hard drive, and thus when we restore the
partition table the system is still not working correctly.  Our
recommendation for handling BSI's on networks is to backup (as best you
can) and reformat the drive.  (Low Level *NOT* necessary, but you *MUST*
overwrite the partition sector.)

    Unfortunately, I don't think that's correct technically.  I am not
a complete Netware expert, but it is my belief that right NOW Netware
keeps DOS in memory somewhere and passes interrupts through to it.

    Now, a virus like the Jerusalem would be SOL, because the Int 21h/4Bh
call isn't used, but it's possible that the viruses which infect even on
Open would work.  I haven't tried this as yet, but will be doing so soon.
*grin*  (This is the reason I have a server available for use/abuse...)

    This isn't necessary.  There is no *REAL* difference between a Novell
partition table and a DOS partition table.  In fact, a Partition Table
is a Partition table and can't usually be attributed to one OS or another.
The problem faced is the overwriting of important data, and the swap into
protected mode.  Moreover, the spread of BSI's across the network is
*VERY* difficult, and would probably require that the destination machine
already be infected.

   On the subject of file infectors, good security is your first and best
defense.  A properly secured Novell server is immune to viral attacks.
(Note:  This means that the FILES on the server are immune.  The server
iself CANNOT be infected from a station without either a NLM/VAP specific
virus (of which there are, thankfully, none) or a BSI, which will likely
crash the server.)

    Please note that I am *NOT* a Novell Certified Genius, and these are my
experiences and Best Guesses involving Netware.  If someone would like to
slap me in the face with the facts, I'll shaddup&siddown.  *grin*

Subject: McAfee scan+clean 72v76, 'error in EXE file' (PC)

I am using a slightly outdated version of the McAfee anti-virals and we
recently had an outbreak of slow virus attack around these parts.

While the tools cleaned up the viruses OK, I found to my dismay that several
exe files (e.g 123, window dos, word perfect) were corrupted afterwards--see
header.

I was able to recover from backups, but I'm after explanations/comments as to
what happened. I can think of at least a few:

1. Broken clean.exe, or bad interaction with some feature of these exe's.

2. False positive followed by removal of sequences which were actually part
of the program.

3. A very clever virus passing itself off as the slow virus.

4. Something else :-)

All of the infected programs ran OK until I cleaned them.
Please mail and I will summarise if the responses are interesting.

Subject: Erasing disks with magnets

Hi,

     While a permanent magnet can be great for wiping 5 1/4"
diskettes, you run the risk of magnetizing any ferrous shutter cover
on a 3.5" diskette.  A bulk AC eraser leaves no residual magnetic
charge (when used properly), but costs more.

     We erase 5-1/4"s with a 25lb head positioning magnet from a DEC
Rk-06.  It never fails...

Subject: Multiple Boot Sector Infections (PC)

I recently had occaision to clean up a group of pcs, each having 3
boot sector infections (ping pong, typo, and stoned).  I wanted
a sample of ping pong,  but all I got was stoned (no puns intended ;)

This brings up a wuestion or two in my mind.  Stoned was the result
when I tried to get a sample of pong (by feeding it a disk and accessing
it), but disinfecting with FPROT ver 1.16, Stoned was found first.

What is the relationship (if any) between what's found in memory versus
what's in the boot sectors when dealing with multiple boot sector
infectors?  Is it the order the machine is in infected in?  Something
in the virus' code (well, obviously something in the code) making one
predominate over another?  Something in the PC's configuration?
(These were Epson Equitys I and II.)

P.S. These Epsons gave us a scare.  We booted from floppies, but
couldn't access the hard disks.  The Epson manual said play with the
setup command, but the machines told us it was an unsupported command
(or words to that effect).  Decision time.  We started the machines
back up, disinfected a virus from the boot sector, and then turned off
the power, hoping that this would prevent re-infection from memory.
Well, seems to have worked ok, as FPROT said the virus was gone.  Had
to do this procedure twice, once for each virus.  I don't know if I'd
recommend this way of doing things, but it was the only option open to
us.  Comments anyone?

The Epson Equity Is also scared us when we turned off the power, the
machine said "wait while hard disk is parked"; we were worried the
virus could slip back in somehow.  Luckily, apparently not.

The strain of the Keypress virus that I have had to deal with does

Hello There,
	    I was after a virus information file called I believe
VSUMX108.ZIP or what ever is the Latest Virus Information Summary for
the IBM PC.  I asked in the comp.virus news area and was told
cert.sei.cmu.edu would be the place to get this file from.  I had a
quite extensive look but was unable to find it...
   This is either because :-
	 a) I'm Blind  (Probably true   :-)  )
	 b) It isn't really there at all..
In either case would you be able to direct me to where I could find
this file?

[Ed. The virus summary listing is indeed not available on
cert.sei.cmu.edu, due to Ms. Hoffman's licensing restrictions.  Other
VIRUS-L/comp.virus archive sites, however, do carry it - notably
risc.ua.edu.]

I notice that the file prot200.zip released from Simtel on August 30
contains two files VIRSTOP.EXE and VIRSTOP.BIN, both 8191 bytes long.
VIRSTOP.EXE runs and installs itself even if VIRSTOP.BIN has been
deleted.  Is VIRSTOP.BIN therefore an unnecessary file released with
the others by mistake?

We have been using a simple solution. The solution is using Disk

This should work for all types of drive. This should be ok in an

 Of course! Having the hardware (a computer with a hard disk) is
 certainly not the problem I had in mind. I clearly explained that
 most prospective buyers of antivirus softeware could not obtain
 the large collection of viruses that is necessary to determine
 whether a given virus scanner does or does not work as intended.
 It's not getting a hard disk that's the problem. It's the jealously-
 guarded "samples".  Without them, testing is impossible.

 That is the perceived "hole" that programs such as Rosenthal
 Engineering's Virus Simulator try to fill. It is a very real market
 need. For all practical purposes, prospective buyers of antivirus
 software are being asked to buy a product with no measure of
 performance other than the word of the manufacturer. Any self-
 respecting Purchasing Agent should have trouble swallowing such
 a proposition without question.

 The situation is akin to a software publisher asking you to buy
 his program because "it would prevent your computer from having
 problems", but offered no hard evidence of its effectiveness.
 Snake oil.  Then comes Rosenthal Engineering and offers a product
 that seems to show that the Emperor really wears no clothes, so
 the publishers all protest that the idea is useless. It's not
 useless; it shows that the Emperor wears no clothes, and _that's_
 its usefulness.

 Virus Simulator 2.0 (PC)

 Thanks  to all those who tried my Virus Simulator 2.0 and responded  by  E-
 MAIL or through this forum.

 There  seems to be considerable misunderstanding and controversy  about  my
 Virus  Simulator 2.0 shareware. Many of the questions and  comments  people
 raised  could  be addressed simply by reading the DOC file and  trying  the
 software for themselves. It can be downloaded from a number of sources   in
 just  a few minutes, the whole thing including documentation is  less  than
 58k  (VIRSIM20.COM SLO-Bytes BBS (805) 528-3753 or ask your local board  to
 post it).

 All  my  Virus  Simulator  does is create files,  boot  sector  and  memory
 simulations that set off virus detectors. These are not real viruses.  They
 are  safe,  sterile and won't reproduce by themselves etc. All they  do  is
 pretend  to  be  viruses  so  users can  test  drive  virus  detectors  for
 themselves.  If  an  anti-virus  program reports any  of  the  hundreds  of
 simulations, it will most likely find their real counterparts. If not,  all
 that  is demonstrated is that my validation test suite doesn't  fool  their
 software or their software doesn't report my pretend viruses.

 Virus Simulator is not intended to replace the comprehensive collection  of
 real viruses developers of anti-virus products use in house for testing. It
 is  designed  to be helpful to end users who wish to  try  different  virus
 detecting  programs themselves and rarely have access to the many  hundreds
 of  real  viruses  that are simulated. You'll also be  seeing  it  used  to
 demonstrate anti-virus software at several upcoming computer shows.

 Using  my Virus Simulator, educators can now reinforce lessons on  computer
 security  with a homework assignment that includes detecting a (all  be  it
 simulated) virus. This is far more dramatic than just reading about it in a
 book.

 Those  people concerned about Virus Simulator being used to cause  mischief
 will  notice  that  all the simulations are clearly labeled  as  such.  You
 needn't  run (or boot from) the simulations, but if you do they  will  only
 display that they are a simulation from Rosenthal Engineering. You can view
 them with an editor and read that message in plain ASCII as well. The  boot
 sector simulations and hundreds of files are only written to a floppy  disk
 along  with  documentation files describing them as simulations.  Even  the
 floppy disk's subdirectory is labeled \VIRUS.

 When Virus Simulator is run, it will verify and announce itself in my voice
 to  anyone  nearby. Anytime it generates a simulated test  virus,  it  will
 again announce, in my voice, what's happening. Additionally, when the virus
 in  memory  option is selected, a warning message flashing "TEST  VIRUS  IN
 MEMORY"   is  displayed  continuously.  System  administrators   who   have
 difficulty  dealing  with  these simulations, are  going  to  have  serious
 problems when confronted with a real stealth virus.

 To remove any of my simulations you can use the DOS ERASE, DEL, FORMAT etc.
 All  these  functions  are  much more dangerous  in  malicious  hands  than
 anything  my Virus Simulator can do. A person bent on causing problems  has
 far  more damaging software available as public information. I won't  dwell
 on this but Ralf Burger describes this in some detail in his book "Computer
 Viruses  -  A  High Tech Disease" you can get through  any  public  library
 (ABACUS 1988, ISBN 1-55755-043-3).

 I  make Virus Simulator available generally to all as shareware. It's  been
 suggested  that it would be better to suppress Virus Simulator  2.0,  limit
 access   to  such  a  program  and  release  it  only  through   recognized
 organizations,  on  a need to know basis. These organizations are  free  to
 develop  whatever  validation schemes they'd care to. Presently  users  can
 take advantage of my independent impartial simulator without having to  get
 it from any self serving anti-virus product vendor or organization.

 I  just  don't believe there's any way to substitute  for  actually  trying
 software  for yourself. Anyone is welcome to try my Virus Simulator 2.0  as
 shareware  for  themselves. Any producers of anti-virus  products  who  are
 disappointed in the results demonstrated when using my Virus Simulator with
 their  products, are welcome to contact me directly in confidence. I'll  do
 my  best  to  see that future revisions of  my  simulator  validates  their
 products the best it can.

 Comments and constructive criticism is always appreciated....

 Thank you
