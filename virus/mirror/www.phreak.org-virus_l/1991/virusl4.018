VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: Re: Text in MLTI virus (PC)

  Fridrik Skulason asked about the meaning of the following text in
the MLTI virus:
>        This programm was written in the city of Prostokwashino
>        (C) 1990   RED DIAVOLYATA

The following info was supplied to me by a co-worker who recently
emigrated from the USSR:
  "RED DIAVOLYATA" is a partial translation of "Krasnie Dyavolyata".
It and "Prostokvashino" are the names of well-known Soviet films.
"Dyavolyata" was apparently too hard for the virus-writer to
translate.  It means something like "little devils", and "Krasnie
Dyavolyata" refers to the youth who fought against the White Army
during the Russian Revolution.  The village "Prostokvashino" is a
fictitious one, which explains why Brian McMahon didn't find it in the
books he consulted.

Exactly what I was talking about in issue 17 except the "partition
table" sector (absolute sector one) should be used, not the boot
sector. More, such code can be used to prevent any tampering with
itself, the real partition table, or the active boot sector. At one
extreme I have tried on a system with C: & D: drives was to put all
executables on the C: drive and prohibit ANY writes or formats to that
drive (except with a special maintenance program). The D: drive just
has its low area protected and contains mutable programs and data.

A university or corporate environment might allow writing only to
floppies or bernoullis, protecting the hard disk. While such software
techniques alone cannot prevent an infected boot from occurring from a
floppy - only hardware can do this - they do allow such intrusion to
be detected prior to the load of the OS and can block any such
infection thereafter.

I hope that this will stimulate some activity on the part of the
vendors to provide such protection - it is not difficult to write, but
for me, I would no longer consider any product complete unless some
such form of low level protection was included.

Subject: Hardware damage?

Please forgive my ignorance on this subject...

Is it possible for a virus, etc to cripple physical hardware
components?  I ask as I have recently experienced an abrupt halt of my
system, frying my power supply.  This occurred after aquiring a piece
of software from a supposedly very reliable source.  Just wondering if
this is related, or a coincidence.

Thanks for any help!

Subject: Virex 3.0 init problems? (Mac)

I just received Virex 3.0 a few days ago, and as soon as I installed
it, Gatekeeper (1.1) started going crazy, complaining about things I
had specified to allow in its configuration menu. As an example, I got
NUMEROUS complaints that DA Handler was violating 'Res(other)'
privileges against various applications. As soon as I turned off the
Virex init, the complaints stopped.

Subject: Table of Contents for Virus-L Digest

Being a dedicated listener, and occasional contributor, to VIRUS-L
Digest, I sometimes want to find out what was said, when, and by whom.
There is no index to the Digest topics I am aware of, and therefore I
decided to start the process, at least for myself, by creating a Table
of Contents on a month by month basis.

I routinely download and ZIP the Digest and store the results on
floppies (720K), in 1 month groups.  The big problem is where to find
what I am looking for, a month or so later.  My partial solution is to
use the following WordPerfect 5.1 macros to strip out all but the
topic list and individual submission Date, From and Subject entries.
So far in the month of January 1990, issues 1 to 16 are reduced to a
Table of Contents file of 35,161 bytes, while the ZIPped digests are
148,044 bytes long, and the originals take 335377 bytes.

Following the macros in this submission I am including a sample of the
output from Vol.4 Issue 1.  If there is sufficient interest, I can
submit the Table of Contents on a regular basis to the Digest or some
other appropriate repository.

[Ed. You might want to also take a look at Anthony Appleyard's index
system.]

Perhaps our virus author is a heavy-metal fan.  "Eddie" is the mascot
of the group Iron Maiden.  Eddie happens to be a {corpse, undead, zom-
bie}. (I'm not sure which word to use.  That group's discography in-

Subject: STONED in files (PC)

	For those wanting to check for STONED in executables as
mentioned earlier using the McAfee /ext switch, I would suggest trying
the string "a1 4c 00 *(2) a3 ? ? a1 4e 00 a3" <name>

	While this may generate some "false positives", I would like to
know about ANY files that try to do this since it may indicate a low level
(not through DOS) access of the INT 13 vectors.

	Note: use your own <name> since duplication of one of Mr. McAfee's
names may result in SCAN not checking for the virus otherwise.

I would disagree on point b. - you should keep as up to date as there is.
Whilst the virii you are most likely to experience are "old" and widely
distributed, the newest scanner might one day save you from a very recent
hard disk trasher.  Unfortunately, it is difficult to convince most users
(and "the powers that be") to go to the little extra trouble of updating
their external virus file (or the software itself) as often as possible
(unless they have been caught already).

NO!!  All such disks should be UNNOTCHED.  Get one of your tech's to
bypass the write-protect switch on drive B: on ONE machine that is in
a very secure place.  Make copies of diagnostics disks, installation
disks (more below) etc onto disks that have not been notched.  It may
take a bit of effort on your part to find a supply, but do so and use
them.  (We found a ready supply in our safe - multiple copies of
obsolete software packages like PC (IBM) DOS, PC-SAS.)  For 3.5" disks
pry the slide thingy out.  (That's what I don't like about 3.5" disks
compared to notchless 5.25" disks - a user with malicious intent can
easily disable write-protection and then enable it without leaving any
obvious signs of it).

Similar comments as above re write-protect tabs.  Installation
procedures that write to the installation disks are the pits.  The
sooner that vendors take the virus threat seriously, and start
distributing their software on *unnotched* disks the better - McAfee
Associates, are you listening?  Some software licences we have allow
us to install on many machines - we copy the original disks to
notchless ones and distribute these to the users who want to install
the programs.  (We only do installation ourselves if specially asked -
we would spend all our time doing them otherwise.)  This may seem
paranoid, but (before I started here) there was a case of the notched
but write-protected disks our working copy was on coming back
infected.  The user had taken the tabs off the disks - because of past
experience with install programs that required write access to the
distribution disks - and dutifully stuck them back on when the
installation was complete.  This was not an intentionally malicious
act.

>[further good practices deleted]

My recommendations above may seem a little strong for some, but I
would say you're kidding yourself if you think you don't have to go to
these lengths.  Possible exception - *everyone* at your site who will
*ever* have access to your disks and/or machines *always* does
*everything* that *perfect* users *should* do.  Get the point?

Can't remember where, but I read the following somewhere:
"Once is happenstance, twice is coincidence, three times is enemy action".

With virii, "Once is enemy action", and you have to be very careful if you
want to prevent that one event.

If I am understanding you correctly, WP 4.2 and later versions should
be virus proof?  If this is your assumption then why did we have an
epidemic of the Jeru II virus that infected almost every wp 4.2, 5.0,
and 5.1 at work?  Again, if I am misunderstanding what you are saying
about WP product, then please clarify.  If not, then could you please
shed some light on my question. Thanx

Well, folks - we now have around 400 PC viruses - currently we get on
the average one new virus per day, and the rate is increasing...maybe
we will have 1000 before the end of the year.

Anyhow - for users of F-PROT 1.14 - please add the following encrypted

I know, Ken's system will trash genuine Umlauts and sharp-s, so I had to
resort to this device ...  :-(

The toolkit is regularly updated & comes with a detailed documentation.
It comprises tools for preventing, finding and removing viruses.
The virus-scanner provided with this toolkit is the fastest I've ever
seen; it's search-patterns are derived from the vendor's own research.

Please do not regard the above as advertising: I'm not affiliated or
otherwise economically connected to S&S, nor to perComp; I'm just a
satisfied user.

Btw, as it has been asked in VIRUS-L befor for information of this kind:
We also use F-PROT, and I'm pleased with it. I try to convince as many
users as possible to install F-DRIVER and F-OSCHK on their own computers
(so far I've not been successful enough), and I use Dr. Solomon's
FINDVIRU to cope with heavy virus incidents. I also use ancillary tools
from both packages.

A general remark:

For virus-specific tools, particularly virus-scanners, your final product
list should state
1. how often the tools will be updated;
2. where the virus-specific information is derived from.

ad 1: These days, we are experiencing an ever increasing flood of new
      virus strains and variants. To cope with these new viruses, a
      virus-specific tool has to be updated regurlarly -- actually more
      often than any other product in the EDP market. I'd guess that we
      will have to arrive at monthly updating in the near future.

ad 2: Many vendors take their search string from public sources. Now, two
      virus-specific tools from two different vendors are essentialy the
      very same thing when they exploit search patterns from the same
      external source. Only a vendor who does his own research into
      viruses and derives his own search patterns can offer a genuinely
      particular product. And the more different scanners a user
      applies, the more unknown variants of known viruses he is likely
      to spot.

We have, many times, emphasized that manufacturers are human, too.
Always scan *everything* you get, no matter what the source!

Subject: Weird Thing With F-Prot (PC)

This Wednesday I visited our Law school to check on problem with the
pong virus in their computer lab (three machines, not a big lab).
Each machine had a 5.25" drive and a 20 meg hard disk.  I scanned the
machines, booting off a tabbed write-protected floppy in the A: drive.
I ran McAfee's Scan (version 4.5V6-B), said everything was ok.  Out of
curiousity, I also ran F-FCHK and F-BOOT from the F-PROT package
(version 1.13).  A funny thing happened: when F-FCHK came across the
file INSTALL.EXE from the PCPANEL package (something to do with
redirecting printer output) I got an error message saying it couldn't
write to the A: drive (the familiar "abort, retry, fail"). I ran it
again, same result.  I ran it on another machine, same result when it
came across that file.

This is a bit weird.  Didn't happen using Scan.  Why should scanning a
file provoke a write attempt?  I realize these are not the latest
versions of the packages, but I feel that to be irrelevant.  Anyone
have any ideas?

Sounds to me like two things have happened.

(1) his machined has the STONED virus in its partition table

(2) the copy of SCAN that he has is damaged.  He should call the
McAfee BBS and down load the current version as soon as
possible.

Since the STONED virus is there, he could go ahead and run the
CLEAN program to remove it.  Then see if SCAN could detect any
more.

The STONED (and other partition table) virus is tricky to get
rid of.  I recommend getting the CLEAN program from McAfee
Associates.

		McAfee Associates
		4423 Cheeney Street
		Santa Clara, CA 95054
		408 988 3832 (voice)
		408 988 4004 (BBS)

The current versions of SCAN and CLEAN may be downloaded.  With
these the STONED virus can be removed without the hassle of
removing/losing data on the hard disk.
