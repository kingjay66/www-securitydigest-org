VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: EXE file compression with LZEXE and PKLITE (PC)

There has been recent discussion about the use of the EXE compression
program LZEXE and the possibility that viruses could hide within EXE
files that are subsequently LZEXEed.  Now some virus scanners can look
within these compressed files to see if something nasty is hiding.

I have recently discovered the shareware program PKLITE by PKWARE that
appears to do much the same thing functionally as LZEXE.  Does this
mean now that virus scanners should include a feature to look inside
PKLITEed files?

Does anyone know where I could down load  the macvirus index.
I have heard it is in the form of a self extracting archive and
that it might be in an ftp site with ".fi" somewhere in its name.

Thank you.

        Can anybody recommend a PD/Shareware Disk Utility package
(read "not too expensive 'cuase I gotta buy it myself") that will
allow me to read/modify the boot sectors, FATs, et all on floppies and
hard disks? I will need it to work on all types of disks. Please reply
direct to me at the address below (note: Please try to use the Bitnet
address, our mailer doesn't always let me get Internet mail :) ) and
I'll sumerize to the list if I get any answers.
        Thank you all for your time and effort.

  One other negative comment about F-Prot is:

F-driver.sys does not check drive A for any possible boot sector virus
when we warm boot the machine.  The V-Shield does check drive A for
any possible boot sector virus and will denied the warm boot if there
is any boot sector virus in the floppy drive A.  Hopefully frisk will
implement this for his next version of F-PROT.  It is a great program.

After recently downloading McAfee's VIRUSCAN files, I noticed a
reference to the ZeroHunt virus.  Accoring to the DOC file, this virus
was reported by someone in the Washington, D.C. area.

Can anyone tell me exactly where it was reported, and by whom?  Also,
are there other ZeroHunt infections around the country?

Thanks for any information you can provide me.

hello all:
     when i sent that message to you guys asking for help i happened
to mention that i collect strains of different virii for research.  i
was not making an advertisement.
     please stop sending me requests to give out samples.  i have no
intention of doing this because (no offense) i do not want to be a
part of someone spreading any more mischief!  i have no way of knowing
who any of you are - not that i am pointing fingers - and its unfair
to be asking me for such sensitive things as virus code.
     thank you and i hope i haven't offended you...

Kenneth R. van Wyk <krvw@cert.sei.cmu.edu> recently informed me that the GAO

interested in an electronic copy may get it from there by anonymous ftp.

The part about confirmation of receipt of the report is explained in the
following excerpt from above file:

   **************************************************************
   *   This is the first GAO report to be made available over   *
   *   the Internet.  GAO wants to know how many people         *

Would those of you who received the report from me via email (or who
got a copy from someone who did) please email to swolff@nsf.gov.  I
want to encourage the government to do more of this kind of thing.

CHRISTMAS VIOLATOR VIRUS

There has been a hacked version of Omen Technology's DSZ ZMODEM External
File Protocol Module called DSZ1203.ZIP.  The DSZ file inside is infected
with a new variant of the Violator virus known as the Christmas Violator
or Violator-B4 virus.  The virus contains a an ASCII message from a group
called RABID and contains a Christmas Greeting.  It is not known what else
the virus does.

The following search string can be used by VIRUSCAN with the /EXT switch
to check for the virus:

     "51 ba ? ? fc 8b f2 81 c6 9b 11 bf 00 01 b9 03 00" Christmas Violator

If you find this virus on your system, run VIRUSCAN with the /D option to
delete the infected files.

NEW BBS LINE

A new bbs line has been added to Homebase BBS at (408) 988-5190.  This line
has a US Robotics Courier 9600 Dual Standard providing a 9600bps connection
using v.32 and MNP-5.  Hopefully, this will make getting the software easier
for International Long Distance callers.

MIBSRV (130.160.20.80) has had a hard disk crash.  Lucky for me, it was
just the disk with the operating system and user home directories. :-(

Oh, how true.

I remember a submission some time back that asked about files which,
regardless of document length, only stored a few bytes of garbage.  I
recently had that happen, and I'm sure it's just a bug.

The problem I encountered was that Word Perfect version 5.0, when
saving to 4.2 format (one of the options under <ctrl>F5) will save an
eight byte file *and erase the previous version, not just rename the
file* if the "backup" options are turned on.

Let me say that, while Word Perfect is *still* currently my editor
(and disk manager:) of choice, the discovery of this bug lost me four
daus work on the reviews of FPROT and Anti-Virus Plus. :(

Subject: Unix and Mainframe Viruses

        A point seems to be being overlooked in the recent discussion
of the vulnerability of Unix to viruses.  It was overlooked in the
past discussions of the vulnerability of mainframes to viruses.

        It isn't necessary for a virus to infect or subvert the
operating system to cause damage.  A Unix virus only needs to
infect applications to which the user has the Write privilege.  A
VM virus only needs to infect applications on the user's read-write
minidisks.

        It is true that most MS-DOS and Macintosh viruses subvert the
operating system or operating system software somehow: the System
file, the boot sector, the Desktop, COMMAND.COM.  But that is not an
essential characteristic of viruses or the virus threat.  The general
threat is still present even if the threat to the operating system is
absent.  And if there are vulnerabilities in various versions of Unix
to a gradual escalation of the privileges of the virus code, as one
correspondent said, the threat is greater.

Subject: New virus (PC)

I've found a new virus on PC at the beginning of December, but it has
been around here at least from the end of June. I've named that virus
as 2480 virus, because its size is that.
2480 Virus spreads only (I think) if the year is set to 1988 or earlier.
If it is later than 1988, infected files will occasionally display
the logo of European Crackin' Crew (Does anyone know anything about that
group??) when user executes an infected program.
2480 Virus adds 2480 bytes to the end of every .COM file it decides to
infect. It doesn't infect files very quickly and it seems that infection
happens only at the certain time. It will also change the last modification
time to the time when infection happened but the files' dates remain
unchanged. 2480 Virus is not memory resident and it can easily be noticed
because the European Crackin' Crew's logo is at the end of every
infected .COM file.
This virus is not detected by the ViruScan V72, but I've sent a copy
of it to Mr. John McAfee and Fridrik Skulason, so hopely the ViruScan V73
and F-Prot 1.14 will find this virus :-)
