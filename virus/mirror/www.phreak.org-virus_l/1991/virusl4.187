This particular virus is extremaly easy to remove. It may be done
very quickly by any non qualified person in the following way:

1. Rename all executable COM and EXE file to something else (CCO and
   EXX).
2. Reset computer from clean disk.
3. Run CHKDSK /F
4. Rename all CCO and EXX back to COM and EXE..
step 3 is necessary only if you want back two sectors occupied by
virus. DIR II will do the rest for you. But remember, above work only
with DIR II.

He forgets that some data-files are also program files (not for the

interpreted language can infect all the other "data" files of this
interpreter.

Fred said he uses his spreadsheed whitout worrying, but if I write a

after usgage all his spread-sheeds are infected. If it is a

No, it is *NOT* a bug. The virus *DOES* check whether a disk is
already infected. In this case it neither updates FAT nor writes
itself to a disk. It is true, nevertheless, that such a mark ((F)FFEH)
cannot be used to "vaccinate" a disk. Such a "vaccinating" will cause
additional problems - the virus won't infect a disk BUT IT STILL WILL
crosslink all executables to the cluster. And since there will be no
the virus body on a disk - there will be much more difficult to detect
an infection and to repair files. COMMAND.COM being cross-linked to a
"vaccine" cluster without the virus body will be just corrupt as well
as other executables.

One more tip to detect an infection. Suppose you have a disk similar
to described above. It mustn't be exactly BACKUP disk - it's enough to
have a file occupying the last cluster. Now suppose this disk is write
protected. Thanks to [cf. Fred Waller] "a simple hardware device
called a write-protect tab" (grin) the virus won't infect a disk.
Neither it will overwrite the file. But this file (using the last
cluster) becomes unaccessible - DOS will report "File allocation
error" while reading such a file. The reason is that the virus
decreases the actual disk size and, hence, DOS believes the last
cluster to be beyond the disk. It is not just an assumption - I've
tested this. Oh, yeah, as was already mentioned by others, DOS won't
report "Write protect error" due to the virus.

In the previous message on the same subject I wrote the virus tries to
open a file in the *ROOT* directory on C: not in the *CURRENT*. I
appologize. It really uses *CURRENT* directory. But the virus still
tries to *OPEN* not to *EXECUTE* this file.

I have been attacked by the Empire virus. Both fprot and scan detected
the virus in the boot sector of both my hard drives. fprot was unable
to remove the virus for the boot sector but clean82 reported successfully
removing it. The problems the Empire virus originally caused seems to have
dissappeared however fprot200 still reports the virus in the boot sector
of both drives. I backed up my D drive insuring that I the virus was not
infecting any backed up files and reformatted the drive and restored and
still fprot200 reports the Empire in the boot sector of the reformatted
drive. Is it really there or fprot200 lying to me. Scan82 detects no viruses
after clean82. Does anyone have any ideas?

Are you sure that "Sometimes Dos updates" all copies of the FAT up to
the end?  When it happens? How I can initiate Dos to do it? I observed
this virus on the few computers and the difference in FAT was on each
of them. Two computers worked with this virus in memory nearly 1-1.5
month and users didn't know about it.  To my mind the difference in
FAT is a stable symptom but not only _ONE_.

Yep. Two times I found virus on the hard disk in the cluster 714 and
2371 (I can't remember this numbers exactly but) which are the last
clusters on the 5" 1.2Mb and 3.5" 730Kb diskettes respectivly. I can't
explain why there were the last clusters but not the pre-last but it
was so. Also I know the other abnormal effects when virus infects disk
but didn't write itself to the last cluster. May be it is an error
too, but anti-virus developers _HAVE TO_ know this.

 Best Wishes.

For those epidemiologists who like to follow the spread of these
things, the DIR II virus has definitely reached MIT.  Our Lab and the
one at the Sloan School both have machines with all the symptoms.  I'd
say it first appeared in our lab on or about Oct 1, 1991.

At risk of seeming obtuse, I ask, just what is the method of
transmitting this virus from machine to machine?  Is it by physically
transferring an infected executable from one machine to another?

Subject: Viruses and OS/2 (OS/2)

Just to add a little to what Bill Arnold posted concerning the
question on whether DOS viruses and antiviral programs will work under
OS/2 2.0, most all scanning programs should work with no problem.  DOS
system monitor programs that require a device driver will most likely
work under 2.0 unless they do something very abnormal.  From what I
have seen and heard about OS/2 2.0, it should allow you to specify
device drivers that a DOS program needs, which are then started
whenever the DOS program is invoked.  Antivirus drivers will only be
able to monitor activity for the single DOS program or session though,
since it will be running in the virtual machine mode of the 386 or
486.  Thus, you will have to specify the device driver in the
configuration information for each of your DOS programs.  I think you
will also be able to specify DOS device drivers in the OS/2
CONFIG.SYS, and they will then be available to all DOS programs
without having to set them up individually.  I have done tests on the
effects of DOS viruses on OS/2 1.x systems, and the situation there is
bleak.  As soon as I get the next OS/2 2.0 beta, I will be doing some
more tests on the effects of DOS viruses, and will keep the digest
posted.

To mount the soapbox for a second, it is indeed unfortunate that some
basic virus protection measures are not built into OS/2, which IBM
bills as an "advanced" operating system, e.g., partition table and
boot sector integrity tests and backup utilities, system file and .DLL
self-checks, and even a full blown "integrity shell".  Hopefully, OS/2
developers will recognize the need to include such functions in the
operating system itself and include them in future OS/2 versions.
Until then, OS/2 systems are generally as vulnerable to virus
infections as is any DOS system.  (And we're supposed to use OS/2 for
our mission-critical applications???)

Our lab machines run a virus check at boot and are SUPPOSED to hang if

I recently received a few diskettes which were reported to be infested
with the "Happy New Year" virus.  I scanned the diskettes with
VIRUSCAN (McAfee), VIRUSAFE (Eliashim), Turbo Anti-Virus (Carmel),
Norton Anti-Virus, and Central Point Anti-Virus.  All reported the
diskettes to be free of any viruses.

The product that gave the false alarm is called V-BUSTER, published by
Looi Hoong Thoong in Penang, Malaysia.  It should not be confused with
VIRUS-BUSTER, distributed by Leprechaun Software in Georgia.

While a false alarm may seem to be a harmless event, it can have
serious consequences.  It can cause the user to delete files or
reformat disks unnecessarily.  Workstations may be taken offline from
networks or whole networks shut down.  At the very least, access to
computer resources are denied while the user attempts to find and deal
with the phantom virus.  Most importantly, from a vendor's
perspective, the reputation and reliability of the provider of the
suspect media are called into question until the true situation is
known.

All vendors of virus detection products should take as much care in
ensuring that false positives do not occur as they take in ensuring
that actual viruses are reported.

I have seen postings and their replies in the same issue of VIRUS-L
before.  How does it happen? (Ken?)

No, the same logic would state that "saddles fit horses, saddles also
fit tigers, therefore saddles cannot tell tigers from horses."

The statement that the argument is wrong is itself wrong.  If computers
CAN tell viri from [other] programs, then why are viri so widespread?
Now, computers CAN be made to recognize virus-like behavior, but since
viri are a subset of programs, it is possible for a non-viral program
to exhibit virus-like behavior.  Take SideKick, for example.  It goes
resident, it intercepts interrupts (and tinkers with them in real time),
and writes to disk (Notepad, which I think can be coerced into even
reading and writing an executable).  DIET, Padgett's DiskSecure, and
other programs also exhibit some virus-like behavior.

The problem is finding some way to allow the known non-viral programs
which exhibit virus-like behavior to operate, while preventing other
programs which exhibit virus-like behavior (viri) from operating.

About the only way is to have a system which includes a series of
permissions and has trusted paths for assigning and enforcing these
permissions.  About the only way to implement such a system is:

The hardware and software will have to be designed keeping the trusted
path in mind.  Perhaps unfortunately, they would have to be designed
together to work together, so retrofitting existing machines may be
difficult.  Also, the security features would have to work continuously
and independent of the user.  Jay's "Virus-Proof" machine and Fred's
"Virus-Resistant" machine may work okay, but they are user-vicious in
that the user plays a major active part in maintaining the security, and
the protection can be disabled via the "big red" or "small colorless"
switch.  Padgett's machine is better in that a lot of the security is
now transparent to the user, but there is still no trusted path, and a
virus (or a Trojan horse) can still subvert the system (how well does
your machine hold up against 12 Tricks?).

It is mandatory that a system's security be independent of and
transparent to the user to be successful.  From what I've seen, the vast
majority of viri have been spread by people who are either computer-
illiterate (don't know what they're doing), are as security-conscious
as a biscuit (are oblivious to what they're doing), or just lazy (don't
want to do anything more than they really have to).  These people cannot
or will not use any security features if these features require them to
have an active role.  Of course, this brings up two points which have
been brought up before by others on this list:  implementation and user
education.  For any security solution to be effective, it will have to
be implemented across a major portion of the installed base of machines.
Also, users would have to be trained in basic security measures as well
as use of the new features of their machine.

But that's a completely different matter.  On to the next thing...

This sounds similar to a problem I studied in Computability, which asked
if it was possible to write a program in some language to detect an
infinite loop in ANY program of the same language.  The proof showed that
it was impossible to do so.  While I admit that I'm not up to speed on my
formal proofs, it seems to me that it would also be impossible (or nearly
so) to write a program (NOT a signature scanner) to detect ANY virus,
known, unknown, or yet to be written, without error.

What is a virus (in Cohen's thesis).  Further comments depend on a good
answer to this, but....

I don't think I'm originating this, but the way _I_ would show that a
program to check whether a program infects a system is impossible,
(assuming the system is sufficiently complex that infection _is_ possible)
is by assuming such a program P exists.

Write a program P' which does the following:  apply P to P'.  Infect if and

I would have to see Cohen's thesis to see if it is only a more
sophisticated version of that.  Is it available by ftp?

A very good point.

On the contrary, I would suggest that the true virus "artists" would
be quite stimulated by the thought of working around a particularly
ingenious detection technique.  The slim chance of success would drive
them to succeed.  Consider the two clowns in Bulgaria who are foiling
detection methods that haven't even been implemented yet!

Of course, the relatively common phenomenon of virus "planting", by
which I mean the practice of placing someone else's virus on a target
machine to cause trouble, might very well go out of fashion.  After
all, if new virus detectors can keep pace with new viruses, then there
is only a slim "infection window" which would generally be available
only to the virus writer.
