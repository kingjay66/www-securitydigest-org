VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,

Was it actually trying to write to the System *file* or just to the
System *disk*? If the latter, it may just have been ResEdit trying to
write its scrap to disk when you did the copy. If the resources were
large enough, it would spool the copy onto disk rather than store it
in memory. You would probably find that with any large cut/copy in
just about any application. Just a thought.  Just ignore me if I'm way
off base :)

The stoned virus infects the boot sector of any disk.  Booting appears
normal before and after infection.  From time to time the computer
with the virus will display the message "Your computer is now
stoned!". I've heard rumors that it also increases the length of the
boot file or some other file by a byte each time it runs.

It infects disks by infecting any disks that are inserted into the
machine when they are made the default drive.  It is terminate and
stay resident . It grabs the soft boot vector so that ctrl-alt-del
doesn't remove it from memory. Therefore it will infect any "clean"
boot disks.  The garaunteed way to rid it from memory is to power down
the computer.

McAFEE and associates supply a share ware virus destroyer which will
recognize and distroy this virus. I highly recommend it.  You should
get it directly from their BBS for which I do not have the phone
number

When you install System 7.0, it will tell you that Disinfectant 2.4 is
not compatible, and to upgrade to 2.5.  (The interesting part is that
it told you this before there *was* a 2.5.)  However, 2.4 *will* work
with System 7.  You must, however, leave the Disinfectant INIT in the
System folder itself, rather than moving it to the Extensions folder
as suggested by System 7.  You may also find the Disinfectant
complains about running with Multifinder, which cannot be turned off
with System 7.

The latest release (to the best of my recollection and files) is 2.5.1.
This is available via ftp from ftp.acns.nwu.edu (129.105.113.52) and
numerous other sites as well as many commercial services.

 Not at all! Some effective hardware protection devices cost

 The Stoned spreads via infected diskettes. Your idea has already
 been implemented by several authors. There's a public program (by
 Mike McCune), available from the SIMTEL archives and probably at
 CMU, which immunizes diskettes against several boot viruses at the
 same time, including the Stoned, the Joshi, the Brain, the Ashar,
 the NoInt and several others.  It does this by exploiting the fact
 that those viruses will not reinfect disks that are already
 infected, and look for a few bytes of their own code to determine
 whether the disk is infected or not. Writing those bytes into
 the disk at the appropriate place fools the virus into thinking
 that the disk is already infected. The program isn't particularly
 fancy, but works. It includes full source code (.ASM).

 One problem is that such immunized disk(ettes) loose their ability
 to be booting disks.  Generally not important, because most diskettes
 don't need to be booting. They may be made into booting disks again,
 but then they loose the immunization.

 > For $5 a shot, do you think anybody would go for it?

 The above program is available free, but the author asks a voluntary
 contribution if it's found to be useful.

 Regarding immunization against the Jerusalem, this too has been
 available for some time, but since the Jerusalem is a file infector,
 all files, not just the Boot Sector, have to be protected. An early
 program that does that, "vaccinate" systems against the action of
 the Jerusalem virus, is called IMMUNE and was written by Y. Rakavy
 and Omri Mann.  It's a very small (800-byte) TSR which specifically
 monitors the system for the appearance of the Jerusalem virus.

 IMMUNE is also free.

 There are others. Some of the general-purpose utilities include
 variations of the above methods.

 "mechanical problems", not mechanical programs, probably. Certainly,
 defective hardware is that: defective. The noise may or may not be
 normal, but doesn't mean that software can overcome hardware.

 If a software command can cause a drive to park its head so that
 it damages it, then obviously it wasn't designed to avoid such a
 possibility.  From the design standpoint, the remedy is simple to
 conceive and implement.

 We can say that the software command was within allowed limits and
 that one of these limits included the possibility of damage.
 I never said that software cannot *damage* hardware - though it's
 generally not easy to do.  It can damage it IF the hardware is
 so designed that it ALLOWS the software to cause damage.

 This has nothing to do with reliability of hardware protection.
 An illustration offered many times before: the simplest hardware
 write-protection available is the piece of black paper called
 a write-protect tab; no software can overcome it.  Ever.  No
 matter how sophisticated.

 >... but repeated lengthy seeks could conceivably cause mechanical
 > damage.

 If the drive is made to withstand 100,000 seeks before failure,
 it should be expected to do that. But if it fails before, well
 then, it failed.  Nothing to do with software overcoming hardware
 protection: once the drive fails, it becomes a non-drive.  At no
 point, however, did the software succeed in making a disk write.
 And THAT was the object of protection. It was never defeated.

 > I agree with you in that hardware protection is a substantial
 > level better, but it is not impenetrable in practice.

 As a class, hardware can readily be made TOTALLY impenetrable to
 SOFTWARE attack of the kind considered when discussing viruses.
 Totally.  But it's easily defeatable by the operator, or by other
 hardware.   Just as the Pecking Order says.

 The main reason for this is that functioning software only exists
 as a FUNCTION OF hardware, but not the other way around.

 Note that hardware MAY BE intentionally (or carelessly) designed
 so that it is vulnerable to software attack; but there's nothing
 inherent in hardware that must allow such vulnerability.

 Software, however, is always vulnerable to the actions of hardware,
 and CANNOT avoid or bypass them UNLESS permitted by the hardware.

 Just as the Pecking Order says.

 I believe this is not a good reason.  As an analogy illustrating
 my opinion, let me say that Certus' Novi will cure infections by
 the new SVC 5.0 and will also remove it from memory - although it
 doesn't *identify* the virus because Novi was created before SVC 5
 was known.  Does this mean that SVC 5.0 is related to... the Devil's
 Dance, which NOVI also cures?  Of course not!

 The criterion proposed above (cure/removal by a utility) shouldn't
 be accepted as a basis for establishing taxonomical relationships.

 What we need is:

 1. A much better definition of what are the accepted *distinguishing
  classification characteristics* for each accepted "class, group,
  subgroup, family, subfamily, genus, species, variety, etc.",
  whatever TAXONOMICAL subdivisions are settled on.  These could be
  based on either functional or structural characteristics. Better
  structural rather than functional (not system-dependent).

  Once such guidelines are accepted, they should be enforced, even if
  proven inconsistent at times. (Formal revisions can be made, of
  course). It's the only way to have a practical taxonomy of viruses.
  Otherwise, it will continue being just about anybody's mess, as
  it is now.

 2. Paralell with the development of such taxonomy, a suitable
  NOMENCLATURE should also be developed. All the current ones simply
  stink.  Virus nomenclature should be strict, should be bound by
  rules, BUT it should simultanously allow considerable naming
  latitude to the describing author.  The strictest date priority
  would prevail.  The epithet(s) chosen by a species' author should
  be unassailable, and could be ammended only to the extent needed to
  produce compliance with agreed-upon naming rules, or if his
  description was so ambiguous as to leave doubt about the object
  being described. Hopefully, the nomenclature convention should
  also yield easy-to-remember names. I vote for a binomial
  nomenclature, analogous to the Linnean used in the natural
  sciences. (This is actually binomial+plus, since it supports
  "varieties", which add a third epithet to the binomial).

 3. Supporting both taxonomy and nomenclature, a system for the
  definition and storage of authentic virus TYPES should be
  established.  Holotypes should be defined and segregated by
  species authors at the time of first description.  The storage
  system might be centralized but preferably shouldn't be, to
  prevent hoarding and for other reasons.  Repositories and
  curators should be established at several points, well situated
  geographically.  Type material, wherever stored, should be
  specially protected and handled to insure continued and reliable
  identity.

  Unlike other taxonomical entities, virus holotypes can be copied
  perfectly and inexpensively, yielding perfect isotypes. This means
  that decentralized storage of virus types need not have any of the
  disadvantages often presented by decentralized storage of other
  taxonomical types.

  The existenced of such type-material collections would not preclude
  the establishment and development of non-type collections elsewhere,
  either commercial or other.

 Only after we do all the above, can we let Vesselin create Computer
 Virology.

Subject: Request for Standards

  Reading every article I can find on computer viruses, I find a
recurring error on the part of many writers. They try to compare
apples to oranges.

  I continue to see attempts to compare products of one category to
products which fall into a different type of operational category.

  I continue to see reviews where a new product is being compared
to a year old version of another product.
(ie... rating SCANV77, when the current ver. is 84)

 Is it a fair review, where the author writes a NEW, never released
virus to test, programmable scannng programs, which don't have the
Virus-ID string?

 Is it fair for an author to write a test virus program designed to
circumvent the abilities of one category program, but test it
againist a category program designed to find it, then compare the
two.

 The new user who is reading about viruses, can surely be mislead
as to the effectiveness of any given product with this type of
review.

 One of the biggest problems faced in fighting the threat of
computer viruses is misleading information. For this reason, I
suggest that standards be agreed upon for assessment of Anti-Virus
software, Product categories, Testing criteria and etc...

 Hopefully, some type of STANDARDS it will reduce much of the
misleading information and allow for better comparison of products
by less experienced users.

 If such a standard is written, we will all benefit from more
accurate reviews and ratings of Anti-virus products.

 I feel that it's really unnecessary to invent systems that could
 *never* be infected.  A virus-resistant system is quite enough.
 We don't really need a totally virusproof approach.  Some head-
 banging-against-the-wall seen here is (as always) self-inflicted
 and caused by the search for such absolutely foolproof protection
 - even though, as the reasonable persons we are, we have knowledge
 that it, like most other "absolutely" solutions, is not achievable.

 So what if we allow a small leak? If the leak is small enough, it
 will be easy to monitor. Much easier than monitoring an entire
 system!

 The matter of TIME is also overlooked. We don't need to make our
 machines both safe and functional at the same time. They can be safe
 most of the time, but only partially functional, and they can be
 fully functional (but less safe) at certain special, carefully
 monitored times. This, too, would not require a virus-proof machine,
 but rather a virus-resistant one.

 Finally, the best way to achieve very high security (and stil have a
 functioning machine) is with the help of hardware. While even this
 may not yield a totally virus-proof system, it doesn't really have
 to, since we don't really need virus-proof systems.

 Generally speaking, yes, but maybe not, sometimes.  And only
 on Wednesdays, but nobody REALLY knows. There are many viruses
 capable of "attacking" PC clones running MS-DOS.  Some, however,
 will stumble at some point of their execution, on finding a kind
 of hardware or software their author did not consider. I have an
 old Compaq 286 which unceremoniously freezes up some viruses
 considered to be successful infectors elsewhere. On such systems,
 the virus might not run, or if it runs it may fail to infect, or
 if it infects it may not infect properly, or if it does, it may
 not activate as intended, etc., etc.  Viruses often are rather
 delicate things.  Not "robust" at all, he he.

 So, an unintended form of "discrimination" exists already, in
 reality.  However, because of the number of "virus species"
 if a machine is not infectable by one, it will be infectable by
 another. And there's more than enough of them to go around.

 > In disease terms, if you vaccinate enough people so that an

 Apart from the fact that we don't know any diseases that have
 actually been "killed" that way (smallpox wasn't!), I don't like
 the parallel for other reasons. Computer viruses and biological
 diseases are unrelated in nature, action and mode of spreading.
 One of the worst misnomers ever concocted was calling these programs
 "viruses".  They aren't viruses nor anything near.  There are far
 more differences than similarities between computer "viruses" and
 the biological ones.  (Has anyone ever seen a non-TSR disease?)

 Unlike biological ones, computer "viruses" never need an active
 host to "survive". They can be kept safely tucked away in a desk
 drawer, and be brought out at the owner's whim two years later.
 Nothing whatsoever to do with the theoretical "dying" of animal
 diseases. Nor do they jump from computer to computer across the
 air.

 Computer viruses are programs with some special characteristics,
 that's all.

 Virus-writing is not a cost-conscious activity. Virus fighting, on
 the other hand, is!  If, instead of designing ONE virus to infect
 all MS DOS machines, they have to design seven viruses to infect
 SEVEN machine variations, then we can be sure that there will soon
 be SEVENTEEN new kinds floating around, instead of just one, or
 even seven.  What, exactly, does such response do to infection-
 likelihood statistics?

Hello.
Just received and made available in our FTP'able directory:
	ANSIKILL.ZIP

This shareware program removes the possibly embedded escape sequences
(ANSI "bombs") from any comment file included in a self-extracting
.ZIP archive.  It does not remove completely the comment file, like
STRIPZIP does.

SCANV84 found the file "clean".

Best to all, Claude.
