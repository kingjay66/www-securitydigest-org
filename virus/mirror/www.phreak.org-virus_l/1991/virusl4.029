VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: Virus or DOS clash ? (PC)

	A strange file has started appearing on some of the disks
of one student over here. Although I do not think that it is a virus,
I have remote fears that it could be. Having never come across this
phenomenon before, could someone please enlighten me about the
causes of the event:

The file appears in the directory listing of 5 1/4in floppies:

<delta>4<e-accent>MSDOS   3.3    0    15-00-80   12:00a

where:

<delta> is the delta sign
<e-accent> is a capital E with an accent over it


I unfortunately have not got a copy of any anti-viral programs in
my hand at the moment (it's friday evening [...]). So I do not know
it this happening is actually recognised as a virus or not.

My guess would be some clash between MSDos 3.3 format and 4.1 format.

Subject: Mouse working while PC goes crazy - explanation (PC)

Mikael Lindberg Mortensen recently described a problem where a PC
appeared to crash in a peculiar manner, leaving the keyboard locked
and the speaker making beeping noises. Since the mouse appeared to
remain operational, it was suspected that a virus had in some manner
*partially* disabled the PC.

Let me point out that most mouse device handlers (software to manage
the low level operations of i/o devices, such as movement or button
operation) are interrupt driven and so, if the interupt and its
associated software remain intact in memory, it is quite possible for
peripheral devices to exhibit normal behaviour despite a primary
system failure. I cannot speculate on the cause of Mikael's PC crash
(it might just have been an electrostatic discharge) but as I have
illustrated, the survival of the mouse does not mean that the PC
remains operational and certainly does not prove the presence of a
viral infection.

Subject: more on 'Virus Protection and Universities'

An interesting thing on this topic, protecting against viruses at
universities, is the policy in the quasi-public micro lab in the
basement of my building.  It has about 15 MACs and about 15 PCs.  Upon
entering, there is a MAC Plus with an external drive at the monitor's
desk.  The external drive has a big note taped to the top of it:
"Check All Mac Disks For Viruses".  If you come in and use a MAC, when
you sign in, you are supposed to check any disk you bring for MAC
viruses.  What is odd is that there is no such requirement for users
of the PCs.  Does this reflect the statistical proportions of viruses
in the real world?  More on MACs than on PCs?

Felow Networkers,

Recently we have had a student on campus here contract the Stoned
virus on her floppy disk.  Well, it sent a shock wave through most of
our students and staffs who use our computers, to say the least.

Not knowing very much about this particular virus, I was wondering if
anyone on this list could provide me with some info on it (prevention,
eradication, etc.).  Any info would be greatly appreciated.

Viruses are in general more common that people would like to think.  I
am in general responsible for security on machines other than Mac's,
unix mostly, but have enough years in this that I can perhaps give you
a different perspective from your other replies.

It's not a question of Bias, the mac system is very powerful, but part
of that power comes from openness.  Openness leaves one vulnerable.
(I am generally biased against macs, with the exception of their
usefullness for desktop publishing)

I have a similar problem and a question.  The McAfee Scan program has
detected the Stone virus on some commercial software I just bought to
run some lab equipment. I called them and they were surprised to hear
about it as none of the disks they sold me were system disks yet the
SCAN program says that the virus is in the boot sector. Are these
disks infected or not?  If they are infected, will the virus infect
other machines if I do not boot from these disks.

I am basically a Mac person but have to use an XT to run this
software. The software is hanging for no apparent reson, which is why
I decided to look for a vrius. Will the Stone virus cause exe files to
just hang?

Thanks for any help anyone can provide.  This is a bummer situation
and it looks like I'm stuck with it. By the way, I agree with the o
previous comment, the McAfee software seems very nice and I will be
sending in my shareware fee.

   This is marginally related, but the April issue of the Mighty Mouse
comic has our hero being abducted into a computer (by a femme of the
name Dot Matrix), in order to battle a computer virus. The virus looks
amazingly like a worm (segmented). MM does not want anything to do
with it until Dot tells him how it can escape onto the network. He
finally stops it before it interfaces to the external modem juncture.

   So, how soon do we start to get drawings in THIS digest?

It can preclude unauthorized access to a disk but cannot prevent data
destruction (only hardware can pprevent loss), Fischer's PC-Watchdog,
Certus' CERTUS, and Enigma-Logic's PC-SAFE are also all good products
for this function but all require administration. Weighing the
tradeoffs between CIA and system effectiveness/response is always a
difficult proposition.

Consider the model a "first pass" for the platform integrity
maintenance that we expect from a robust OS such as VMS or MVS that
does not currently exist in MS-DOS and a tool for evaluating proposed
solutions rather than an end-all.

Incidently, it should not cost more than $5.00 per PC as an add-on.

The original version is supposed to trigger on any Sunday, print a
little message (Today is Sunday, why do you work so hard ?), and
delete all executables run. The one I have seen has a bug in it that
prevents it from triggering. It is a Jerusalem variant with a 2xxx
byte un-named TSR and .COM & .EXE files grow (.EXE many times).

This attitude bothers me a bit considering what is being compared.
Certainly, the IBM product is a reasonably good detector and is rarely
more than six months out of date, but what do you do then ? Format the
infected disks ? On the other hand, the McAfee utilities provide
detection AND recovery capabilities as well as being able to check out
a network server that is not even running DOS. You might also look
into the "service license" which authorizes a limited number of
technicians to use the utilities on any machine. Also part of the
McAfee license includes two years of updates and on-line service help
with disinfecting - IBMSCAN does not include this.

What is really wanted is a protection mechanism for the users that is
like the idiot lights on a car - it tells them that SOMETHING is
wrong.  Then the technician is called in with the high-powered (and
tricky) tools for use in recovery. In most cases you do not want the
user to "clean" his own machine because then you loose all tracking
capability (and most I have seen do their own disinfecting just wind
up reinfected.) Putting all of the tools on every machine is a bit
like equipping every car with its own service station.

Many thanks to those who responded. As you recall, I had two machines
with identical numbers of bad bytes on their hard drives, which made
me suspect viral infection (vi).

Incidently, on my home PC there is a ST-251-1 and a ST-225. Both have four
sector clusters and four "bad" heads (but different ones) consequently
both report 40960 bytes in bad sectors.

The answer is **TCell**.

My company SECTRA manufactures a system-surveillance tool called TCell
which checks a unix system for different kinds of changes. The changes
may have been done by an intruder, a virus or by misstake of a authorized
person.

Depending on what security level the TCell administrator has put on a
specific item, the system will do specific tasks like mailing owners of
damaged/changed files or shutting the system down.

TCell currently is ported to sun and HP-UX, but will be ported to other
unix systems or other operative systems if so desired.

>From:    lan@bucsf.bu.edu (Larry Nathanson)
Subject: The virus-ability of a machine...

The basic reason why mac viruses are harder to write, is the
standardization philosophy behind the mac.  First, the standardization
requires learning how to use the toolbox - not an easy task for the
average hack.  As was mentioned- there's a series of 5 manuals that
comprise just the documentation.

Second, the standardization makes it a lot easier to spot a program
pulling a fast one.  If some code tries to write to the boot sectors of
a disk, by making direct low level os calls, a program like SAM will
pick this up, and let the user know that something is making system
calls, bypassing the file manager.  If a virus tries to use the file
manager, then SAM gives a message saying something to the effect of
"Pagemaker is trying to install an code resource".  If you are in the
middle of loading a letter to your brother, you would hopefully note
that this is not appropriate.  If you are installing a new version of
pagemaker into your system, then the system call is appropriate.

On PC, there is no standardization - every program runs differently..
It's very hard to figure out when someone is doing something they
shouldn't.

Three other major factors are the number of machines out there, the
stability of the DOS, and the number of boot sources available.  The
IBM is very widespread, and since most have hard drives, they get
booted off of the same drive.  Also, the dos tends to be stable, and
the boot sequence is long.  This discourages frequent rebooting.  The
same thing on the mac- many hard drives, a stable dos, and long boot
sequences.  It is not uncommon to run 5 or 6 mac programs without a
reboot.  My old apple //e does not follow this pattern.  Most //e's
have floppy disks, and most apple// floppies (DOS 3.3) are bootable,
and boot quickly.  Also, many apple programs destroy the memory
resident dos, after they have loaded.  To continue, you simply reboot
the machine.  If I reboot every time I insert a new program to run, a
virus is going to have a VERY hard time propagating.


An interesting sideline- I work in a service beureau, and we have LOADS
of people who come in with a mac disk, looking for the machine to make
magic happen.  They don't know anything about the mac, and DONT WANT to
learn.  They just want to wave the mouse, and see 300dpi typeset magic.
 So, they sign on to the machine, pop in the disk, and get a message
onscreen that they have a virus.  So, of course, they make the OBVIOUS
leap of logic, and decide that since they didn't get this message on
their machine at home, they MUST have gotten this virus from us!!!
ARRRRGGHH!!  I've had people get outright belligerent, insisting that
we are to blame!  Either that, or they decide this whole virus thing is
a scam, to get them to spend more time and money on our machines.

The danger isn't viruses- I can kill them quickly with any of half a
dozen programs.  The danger is ignorance!

Subject: Repair Shops

When your site experiences a viral infestation, or has ongoing
problems with viruses with no seeming lull between one outbreak and
the next, do you notify local vendors? Like repair shops?  Our site, a
university town, is currently being swamped with the Stoned virus.
It's all over the darn place.  Since I work for the computer center
here, I talked to our local vendors and warned them to check stuff
(there's only four businesses that really count so it was easy).  Only
one so far has said people came in thinking something was wrong with
their machine when in fact it was Stoned.

I think some sort of communication is necessary between local
businesses and oneself to help prevent the spread of viruses.  In case
it hasn't dawned on you yet, we really haven't had much of a problem
with viruses before recently, so many of the do's and don'ts aren't
necessarily obvious to us.  So, comments anyone?

Strictly speaking, I believe it's only a trojan, as these "ANSI bomb"s
don't spread.  However, they can be rather dangerous.  Someone can add
a command in one of the ubiquitous ANSI picture files to have your
ENTER key redefined to format your hard disk.  I find that the best
solution to this is to view them on-line from my terminal program, as
these usually have their own ANSI handlers and will thwart any
keyboard redefinition codes.

Be aware, though, that they can easily sneak these into README files,
and you will have no way of knowing that your keyboard has been
redefined unless you either don't have an ANSI driver, or it hits you.

	The ohio virus exists in several varieties, 5 or 6 at least. Our local
varient will spread to 5.25" floppies only, does not contain any deliberately
destructive code, and causes no major problems. This is reportedly true of all
varieties. So far.
	It is a boot sector virus, so files are not infected. In a university
computer lab environment it may be easiest jut to recopy infected disks from
masters and WRITE PROTECT THEM. This keeps out ALL viruses.
	Disks can be cleaned up with f-prot's f-disinf.exe, or the mdisk
program. You can also copy all the files to another disk, format the disk and
copy them back.

for INFINITE copies is only $500 or $1 per pc for less than 500 pcs.

It has a wide range of tools in the package but in labs we just
install f-driver.sys which will alert us to any infection - and refuse
to allow the infected program to run. we then use f-fchk & f-disinf to
clean up infections.

we get a lot of viruses here - Ohio,brain,ping-pong,korea,stoned,disk
killer, den zuk,jerusalem,alemeda - but f-prot tells us as soon as we
get one and we don't spread it. If only we could reach the great
masses of students here (50,000+) to clean up their disks!
