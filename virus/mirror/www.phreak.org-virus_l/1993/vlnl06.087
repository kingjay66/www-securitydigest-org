virus issues; comp.virus is a gatewayed and non-digested USENET
counterpart.  Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software
platform - diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant,
concise, polite, etc.  (The complete set of posting guidelines is
available by FTP on cert.org or upon request.)  Please sign submissions
with your real name; anonymous postings will not be accepted.
Information on accessing anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue
archives is distributed periodically on the list.  A FAQ (Frequently
Asked Questions) document and all of the back-issues are available by
anonymous FTP on CERT.org (192.88.209.5).

Administrative mail (e.g., comments, suggestions, beer recipes)
should be sent to me at: krvw@AGARNE.IMS.DISA.MIL.

VIRUS-L/comp.virus readers:

I'm currently (finally!) cleaning up the queue of product reviews and
documentation that I have here.  My apologies for taking so long to
get these out the door.  My move here to DC caused the logistics for
updating files on CERT.ORG to change quite a bit.  Now that the
procedure seems to be working well, I'll try to resume a steady flow
of product reviews and submitted papers.  Thanks for everyone's
patience.

Cheers,

Ken

Computers Under Attack: intruders, worms and viruses, Peter J. Denning, ed.,
0-201-53067-8

This book is a very readable, enjoyable and valuable resource for anyone
interested in "the computer world".

That said, I must admit that I am still not sure what the central theme of this
book is.  Denning has brought together a collection of very high quality essays
from experts in various fields, and at one point refers to it as a "forum".
That it is, and with a very distinguished panel of speakers, but it is
difficult to pin down the topic of the forum.  Not all of the fields are in
data security, nor even closely related to it.  (Some of the works, early in
the book, relating to what we now generally term "the Internet", do contain
background useful in understanding later works regarding "cracking" intrusions
and worm programs.)

Syslaw, 2nd ed., Lance Rose and Jonathan Wallace, 1992

The introduction to "Syslaw" states that although the title implies the
existence of a new kind of law relating to electronic bulletin board systems,
in reality it is simply and extension of existing laws, mores and practices.
In the same way, although the book states itself to be aimed at the BBS
community, and particularly sysops, there is much here of interest and moment
to anyone involved with sharing information through computer systems.

Rogue Programs: Viruses, Worms and Trojan Horses, Ed. Lance J. Hoffman, 1990,
0-442-00454-0

Reading the list of contributors to this work was rather like "old home week"
at VIRUS-L.  The introduction states that the book arose from Hoffman's
frustration over the lack of a suitable text for a virus seminar and that the
seminar participants compiled the material from available sources.  Even one of
the seminar participants, Chris Feudo, has recently released a computer virus
handbook (see BKFEUDO.RVW).

If you buy only one book to learn about computer viral programs -- this is
*not* the one to get.  As a part of a library of other materials it may raise
some interesting questions, but it is too full of errors to serve as a "single
source" reference.

                                   Summary

This paper discusses the subject of polymorphic engines and viruses. It looks
at general characteristics of polymorphism as currently implemented. It tries
to maintain a practical presentation of the subject matter rather than an
academic and abstract approach that would confuse many people. Basic
knowledge of the Intel 80x86 instruction set will be highly useful in
understanding the material presented. A very detailed discussion is avoided
not to have the side effect of "teaching" how to create polymorphic engines
or viruses. The purpose is to help computer professionals understand this
trend of virus development and the threats it poses. It should serve as a
starting point for individuals who would like to get an idea about the
polymorphic viruses and how they are implemented. Long gone are the days of
innocence, when any schoolboy could write a virus scanner using a few
signatures extracted from captured virus samples.

The subject of polymorphism can be extended to other areas such as
anti-reverse-engineering or anti-direct-attacks, and it can be argued to be
useful in that context. This paper only looks at the use of polymorphism in
PC viruses to avoid simple detection techniques.

Installation

Both automated and manual installation is provided.

Ease of use

BootX can be run from either the CLI or the Workbench.  Once invoked it can be
made the "foreground task" by a "hot key" call.  The program is menu driven,
with a comprehensive range of actions.

Help systems

Can use the AmigaGuide.library function if available.

Compatibility

Unknown but unlikely to cause problems.  Some problems are noted with Enforcer.

Will work with certain compression programs to check compressed executables.

Company Stability

Unknown, but this is currently one of the major recommended Amiga antivirals.
The program is distributed as freeware.

Company Support

The author's mail and email addresses are given, as well as contact info for
"Safe Hex International".

Documentation

Simple but straightforward directions on the installation and running of the
program.  There is little general discussion of viral programs and operation,
but some is mentioned in conjunction with certain features of the program.
Unusually for a shareware/freeware package there is an extensive glossary which
may provide some background.  (I learned, for instance, that a "linkvirus" is
the term for what is more generally known as a program or file infecting
virus.)

System Requirements

512K RAM or higher and at least one disk drive.  KickStart v2.04 and
ReqTools.library v38 or higher.  Workbench v2.1 or higher to use the language
independence utility and v3.0 or higher to use the AmigaGuide.library help
feature.  Various decompression programs may be needed to check compressed
executables.

Performance

Unknown at this time due to lack of a test suite.  Currently one of the most
highly recommended Amiga antivirals.

Local Support

The author is reachable via Fidonet and Internet mail.

Support Requirements

Users experienced with using shareware should have no problems.

Subject: Review of Chasseur II (Atari)

Of course no one will believe it, but this is *not* prompted by the recent
spate of calls for Atari and Amiga stuff.  I recently had an opportunity to
do some partial testing of some antivirals on other systems and took it.
Unfortunately, the tests are not complete, and cannot be finished at this
time due to the absence of a viable "test suite".  I have, however,
attempted to give some indication of the shareware utilities I was able to
round up, and have added the contact info to the CONTACTS.LST.

Herewith, then, is the first.

Installation

The files (at least BOOTBASE.DAT) *must* be installed in a directory called
\CHASSEUR.II or else the program will not function.

Ease of use

There are only three options on the main menu: check disk, vaccinate and check
memory.  These are represented by icons, with no words.

Help systems

None provided.

Compatibility

Unknown.  The vaccinate function, although stated to be irreversible (which,
oddly, appears to contradict the documentation), seems not to harm MS-DOS
disks, since it adds a jump at the beginning, and adds a short message at the
end.  (MS-DOS "system" disks, of course, will no longer be bootable.)

Company Stability

Unknown.

Company Support

None provided.

Documentation

A README.VIR file states that they believe the program is simple enough that
there is no need for documentation.  This is generally true, but it is a pity
that there is not more detail on some of the claims made for the program.

System Requirements

None stated.

Performance

Unknown.  This seems to be a tool for very technically literate users, aimed at
boot sector infectors only.

Local Support

None provided.

Support Requirements

It is unlikely that even intermediate users would understand, say, the memory
listings generated.  However, it should be effective against boot sector
infectors even in novice cases.  (One should note that *all* of the Atari boot
sector overwriting programs may damage certain self-booting disks.)

User Friendliness

Installation

FLIST must be run first in order to make a FILELIST.LIS comparison database.
Thereafter, FCHECK can be run in the same directory as the database in order to
note changes.  (FCHECK can be run from the AUTO folder as long as FILELIST.LIS
is present as well.)

(A sense of humour!  When invoked, the program presents a message box stating
"I am not a wealthy man  Please consider a donation", signed Roger Lindberg
1991.  The acknowledgement "button" does not state the normal "OK" but rather
"I WILL".  :-)

Ease of use

If FILELIST.LIS exists (which it does, in the distribution file), it must be
deleted first, or a new name must be chosen.  (The documentation states that
the name *must* be FILELIST.LIS.)  Creating the file is not exactly
straightforward: the file must be created, then loaded and then a new menu
selected to add those files to be checked.  Files must be selected
individually.  Then the file must be saved before exitting the FLIST program.

The FCHECK program has no options: it simply checks the file length and
checksum against the stored values.  It must be watched: if their is some
problem the fact is noted, but the program does not leave the information
onscreen before it terminates.

Help systems

None provided.

Compatibility

Unknown.  Generally should not be a problem, but will report changes in
programs which alter their own code.

Company Stability

Unknown.

Company Support

Unknown.

Documentation

Not extensive, but adequate if read carefully.

System Requirements

None stated.

Performance

Reasonably quick operation, once set up.  A bit difficult in doing the initial
installation.  No attempt to "diagnose" changes on the disk.

Local Support

None provided.

Support Requirements

Likely will require assistance of at least intermediate user and someone versed
in the potential of viral programs to alter other program files.

General Description:

The "Immunizer" concept involves a cooperative effort between BIOS makers,
board manufacturers and antiviral software producers.  The central component,
as far as Western Digital is concerned, is the 7855 system controller chip.
With proper implementation, the concept should allow protection of hard disk
and memory areas, while at the same time allowing the user the option to "lift"
the protection via software in order to allow for normal system maintenance
functions.

1.  Product Description:  Gobbler II, Advanced Anti-Virus Tooklit, is a viral
signature identification and removal program copyrighted by COMRAC, the
Netherlands.  This product test addresses version 3.0.

2.  Product Acquisition:  In June 1992 a Victor Smith contacted me over the
Internet and asked if I would test Gobbler II.  He identified himself as
"one"of the programers involved with the program which had started in February
1989.  The Dutch company COMRAC apparently acquired the program in early 1990.
Victor sent me the program UUENCODED in mid July 1992; however, checksum errors
accompanied the transmission.  He successfully retransmitted the program on
July 21, 1992.  He indicated that additional materials would follow via land
mail.  This never occurred.  Electronic mail communications with Victor Smith
ceased to be responsive in October 1992 so details on the program are
incomplete.  Vesselin Bontchev from the Virus Test Centre-Hamburg has issued a
report on Gobbler II's effectiveness against the MtE object module in which he
gives the status of the program as "Shareware?".
