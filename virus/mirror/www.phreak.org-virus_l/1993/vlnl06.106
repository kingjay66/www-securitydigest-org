I am also not convinced that switching a monitor from one video mode
to another for as little as 30 seconds would kill it. Donald's monitor
must have been in a poor condition to start with. The high pitched
squeal is a typical fault affecting old tubes.

It is however possible to destroy the monitor with faster switching
(say 3 mode changes a second) from VGA to 1024x768 if the monitor
requires hardware internal switching of curcuitry. This happens when
you hear a "click" in your monitor when changing modes. The high
voltage power supply, & the tube are briefly put at strain. Switching
quickly between the two modes may kill either in more or less time,
depending on how robust your monitor is.
TVs & monitors don't like having either `no signal' or a floating
input. It often happens that a PC in a lab here is switched off,
and the monitor left on. On one particular brand, we've had
100% failure rate when that happens. Each time, we've had to have
the Power supply replaced.
In another incident, we left one of our router's monitors on by mistake
overnight. The router crashed, the video card sent `god-knows-what'
to the monitor and next day when we came-in the monitor had blown its
fuse, and there was a distinctive burning smell emanating from
its vents. We had to trash it. Not a faulty monitor to start-with:
it was working perfectly fine every day before the incident.

"Trusty" and "effective" are not necessarily the same thing when it
comes to virus protection. :-) While Interferon was a wonderful tool
for its time, that was several years ago... and outdated antiviral
software is worse than none at all.

The only way to be certain of what's on your hard drive is to use a
current antiviral utility, such as Disinfectant 3.1.  This is
available free from most user groups and online services, and from
many dealers and other organizations.  You can also retrieve it from
several ftp sites on the Internet, including sumex-aim.stanford.edu
and rascal.ics.utexas.edu.

There are also a variety of other utilities, some free, some
shareware, and some commercial, but Disinfectant is a good
general-purpose utility, and it's certainly a good place to start.
Once you've determined for sure whether there's a virus on your
system, you should read up on current antiviral utilities and select
one that best fits your needs.  (One option is Virex, the commercial
utility from Datawatch, Inc., that evolved from Interferon.)

Please feel free to let me know if you have any other questions or
need further help in diagnosing the problem.

Well, not exactly.  Dual Boot and BootManager are two different
things, neither of which work quite that way.  There are some
boot-selection programs that actually live in the MBR, but I
don't know of any that are in wide use.  Here's how Dual
Boot and BootManager work:

  - On a dual boot system that's currently running OS/2, when
    you type "BOOT DOS", it saves the current system boot
    record of the bootable partition in a file "BOOT.OS2",
    and saves the current AUTOEXEC.BAT in "AUTOEXEC.OS2"
    (probably CONFIG.SYS as CONFIG.OS2 also; I forget).  Then
    it takes the file "BOOT.DOS" and writes that to the
    system boot record, and takes the file "AUTOEXEC.DOS"
    and copies it to AUTOEXEC.BAT (probably CONFIG, too).
    Then it reboots the machine, and you're in DOS.  When
    in DOS, "BOOT OS2" does the obvious opposites.  None of
    this does anything to the Master Boot Record as far as
    I know.

  - On a BootManager machine, the Master Boot Record is again
    normal; the partition that's marked Bootable in the partition
    table contains a system boot record and other code to run
    the BootManager program.  That program reads the MBR and
    its own internal tables, gives you a choice as to which
    system you want to boot, mungs the partition table  as
    necessary to reveal/hide any partitions that need it,
    and then loads the relevant system boot record and passes
    control to it normally.  (Ah; maybe that's what you
    meant by "the MBR code" giving you a choice of partitions!)

There are some viruses that will infect whatever partition
is currently marked bootable, regardless of whether or not
it's a DOS partition.  The FORM virus is particularly inept
in this regard: it will infect whatever's marked bootable,
and it will assume that the partition it's infecting is a
FAT-formatted partition for purposes of finding unused
space to hide itself.  This can wreak havoc when the
bootable partition is actually BootManager or HPFS, for
instance.

(Note: this posting is just my understanding of the situation;
it doesn't constitute official IBM documentation, and almost
certainly contains at least one error...)

If you are using a program that has the "Protect executable files" option in
it, don't be surprised by these alarms, it usually simply a false alarm made
by it, I'd reccomend using another TSR instead, (you'l be just as safe).
Do not however, exclude the posibility that your PERSONAL copy of ARJ might be

if you are using MS-DOS 6 with DoubleSpace, its a bit of a problem, however,
to my opinion heres what you should do:

a. Boot from a clean DOS floppy (original DOS setup floppy acceptable, use F3
and "Y" to get to DOS prompt).
b. Use your Anti Virus to check the disk. You'l see only a part of drive C: is
checked but this is OK.
c. If the program finds nothing (provided you use a good and updated program)
you can sleep well. The only way a damage could happened to your disk is by
the BootSector of the first partition (the one you boot from). The other
BootSector's DPBs are used only for DOS to determin the volume characteristics
(generally speaking).
For your information: most A-V products do not even check the other
BootSectors as it is not necessary.

It could be that the product you are using is checking a compressed sector so
that it sees garbage and by accident suspects it to be a virus, or that the
DOS SWAP module is pulling a trick on that test. The booting from a clean
floppy, should be reliable enough, try it.

BTW: It is common practice to recover a drives boot-sector by the most generic
action of all: Transfer system to it.
note that in this case the other boot sectors (if available) arn't touched
also!

More information is needed to really point the problem. But it seems there is
no real problem on your friend's PC (concerning the BootSector). If SCAN finds
nothing when booting from a CLEAN DOS floppy, it means that something (or
someone :-) ) is pooling a trick on the program... Could it be that you use
another TSR that hides the boot-sector? the warning SCAN gives (if I got you
correctly) is at the memory scan time, which means that there is a program
that is/was loaded to the memory and contains the series of bytes that
designates a Boot Sector virus, it could be a virus scanner, a benign program,
or a real virus, but one should expect the virus will be found when booting
from the floppy. Try to remove SMARTDRV for a test, and see if it still
happeneds..

BTW: a way to clean generally every boot sector virus is simply by
transferring SYSTEM to the infected drive.

Subject: Flash ROM BIOS and viruses. (PC)

Hello everyone,

I've reacently published an article about what viruses might do to computers
that has a FLASH ROM BIOS, (meaning that the BIOS can be changed by software).

It is obviouse that such a virus CANNOT be cleaned unless a
copy of the "CLEAN BIOS" is saved someware, as the BIOS routines
might be patched with the virus's calles, and the original information might
not be saved anywhare.

This sets a new front to us Anti-Virus developers, that may be easy to solve
at first look (simply backing up the BIOS) but what if our product is applied
to an already infected PC. In such a case those of us that rely on the BIOS's
integrity ;-) (not to mention those who doesn't) might never detect a virus
that infected the PC as the operating system will inherit the virus as a
foundamental feature.

The number of possibilities is huge, the only problem will be to the virus
writer to fing the place the way and the tings that the virus might be written
into and modify.

So far I know of few companies that use this technique, aming them is INTEL.

I'd be happy to read your opinions on the issue...

   Presumably the distributor of the game supplied the disks to the shop,

I informed the supermarket chain, and they informed the distributer

   Most versions of Stoned are relatively benign.  While the most common
   variants may display "Your PC is now Stoned" (about 1 in 8 times) when
   booting from an infected floppy disk, it does not 'crash' or harm your data.

Well, I never actually contracted the virus, so I could be wrong as to
it's action.  But what I said is what I remember hearing.

   > and two of the executable files (bug.exe and scottex.exe) are infected

   Curious, DIR-II on a floppy disk usually infects all executables, (because
   they are placed there by an infected computer).  I don't remember any other
   reports of it in Israel, so it may be a false alarm.

These were the only two executables on the disk, so we're not
contradicting each other.  I knew from SCAN that the viruses were in
thse two files, but I hadn't checked a directory listing, so I didn't
know if there were other executables.

Another complication that Padgett didn't mention, no doubt for the
sake of simplicity, is a diskette drive (generally an external one)
that's supported by a block device driver.  For instance, the external
720K drive on my old AT is supported via EXDSKBIO.DRV and DRIVER.SYS;
it has a BIOS id of 02, but DOS thinks of it as drive F:.  The 02
assignment is made by the INT13-handler component of the device
driver (I assume; I've never dug it out), and the F: assignment is
made by DOS while it's loading block device drivers (IBMBIO.COM
has assigned A: and B: to the internal floppy, and C: and D: to
the partitions of the hard disk; then in CONFIG.SYS E: is the
RAMdisk, F: is the external floppy, and G: is the Bernoulli).

Subject: WARNING: A false alarm..(PC)

Several scanners, including our F-PROT (version 2.09) and SCAN (104) will
generate a false alarm on all CRYPTCOM-encrypted files.

CRYPTCOM is a small program that will add simple xor-based encryption to
COM files.   Although easily broken by single-stepping through the code with
a debugger, this encryption will prevent the casual user from finding or
modifying text messages within the program.

CRYPTCOM has in the past been used to create virus droppers - that is,
a regular infected file is encrypted, but it can also be used to encrypt
legitimate programs.

The problem is that F-PROT will report them as containing "New or modified
variant of PS-MPC", and SCAN 104 (I haven't tested later versions) will
report the files as containing DROPPER [OW].

Both are wrong, however - the files should not automatically be considered
infected.  We will fix this in the next version of F-PROT, and I guess
our competitors :-) will do the same (if they have not done so already).

Subject: Shareware Novel-on-the-Net - Terminal Compromise

Some of you may recall a year or so ago when I posted a review of this
book in Virus-L. IMHO it is an excellent read and its extensive basis
on computer viruses make it particularly appropriate (though you will
have to forgive Winn his use of the DATACRIME, the terror of 1989).

Just as an aside, NONE of the technology or software techniques mentioned
are fanciful, *I have seen every one demonstrated*.

ARCHIE found it as TERMCOMP.ZIP (612k) on knot.queensu.ca in directory
/wuarchive/doc/misc.

(Archie only reported TERMCOMP.ZIP at knot.queens.ca but the opening
screen there recommends that outsiders use wuarchive.wustl.edu. I can
verify that right now it is there as /doc/misc/termcomp.zip)

      THE WORLD'S FIRST NOVEL-ON-THE-NET (tm) SHAREWARE!!!
                       By Inter.Pact Press

                      "TERMINAL COMPROMISE"
                        by Winn Schwartau

     A high tech thriller that comes from today's headlines!

"The Tom Clancy of computer security."
          Assoc. Prof. Dr. Karen Forcht, James Madison University

"Terminal  Compromise" is a highly praised novel about the  inva-
sion of the United States by computer terrorists.

Since  it was first published in conventional print form,  (ISBN:
0-962-87000-5)  it has sold extremely well world-wide,  but  then
again,  it never hit the New York Times Bestseller  List  either.
But that's OK, not many do.

Recently,  someone we know very well came up with a  real  bright
idea.   They suggested  that INTER.PACT Press take  the  unprece-
dented,  and maybe slightly crazy, step to put "Terminal  Compro-
mise" on the Global Network thus creating a new category for book
publishers.   The  idea is to offer  "Terminal  Compromise,"  and
perhaps  other titles at NOVEL-ON-THE-NET SHAREWARE(tm) rates  to
millions  of people who just don't spend a lot of time  in  book-
stores.   After  discussions with dozens of people -  maybe  even
more than a hundred - we decided to do just that.   We know  that
we're  taking a chance, but we've been convinced by  hackers  and
phreakers and corporate types and government representatives that
putting "Terminal Compromise" on the net would be a fabulous step
forward  into  the Electronic Age, (Cyberspace if you  will)  and
would encourage other publishers to take advantage of  electronic
distribution.   (It's still in the bookstores, though.)


NOVEL-ON-THE-NET SHAREWARE Fees For The People:

The suggested donation for individuals is $7.  If you hate Termi-
nal Compromise after reading it, then only send $6.50.  If you're
really, really broke, then tell a hundred other people how  great
it was, send us a rave review and post it where you think  others
will enjoy reading it, too.  If you're only a little broke,  send
a few dollars.  After all, this is how we stay in business.  With
each  registration, we will also send a FREE! issue of  "Security
Insider Report," a monthly security newsletter also published  by
Inter.Pact Press.


GETTING TERMINAL COMPROMISE:

     You  can get your copy of Terminal Compromise from a lot  of
sites; if you don't see it, just ask around.

It  consists of either 2 or 5 files, depending upon how  you  re-
ceive it. (Details at end of this file.)

Feel  free to post all five files of "Terminal  Compromise"  any-
where  on the net or on public or private BBS's as long  as  this
file accompanies it as well.

  I read in Virus-L once about a virus that was carried from Europe to USA in
a sailor's laptop computer. This seems like an increasingly likely sort of
virus carrier, with the multiplication of laptop and 'notebook' portable PC's
and Macs that are around.

                      Other "resting" places

Peripherals are not the only unusual vectors for viral programs.
Consider the common boot sector.  Although a knowledge of the
structure of the boot (and "master boot") sectors, and boot
sequence, is practically a pre-requisite for any serious viral
study, VIRUS-L no less than the Fidonet echoes is still inundated
with postings that state the user has contracted Stoned (or
Michelangelo, or Monkey, or ... ), but has deleted all the files on
the disk and it is still there!  To the vast majority of users the
fact that a program can be located at a *physical* position on the
disk, and is *not* referenced by the file directory list is a
foreign concept.  This confusion may contribute to the enormous
"success" of boot sector viri.

The sector, and even the partition boot record on a hard disk, are
accessible to dedicated amateurs armed with utility software.
However, there are other places to "hide" on a disk which are not as
easily examined.  It is quite possible to format an additional track
outside the normal range used.  The software does not "push" the
limits of the hardware in order to avoid problems between different
drives with variations in tolerance.  I recall special programs for
the Apple II computer which provided thirty eight tracks rather than
the normal thirty five.  There are various programs for MS-DOS, as
well, which provide greater storage on the same sized disks.

In addition to tracks outside of, and between, normal formats, there
is substantial space between the sectors on a disk.  There are
programs which can increase the number of sectors so as to increase
the space on disk.  However, it is also possible to use the
additional space without formatting additional sectors, simply by
writing information to the space between.  This fact has
occasionally been used for the purposes of copy protection with
commercial software.

Both of these "hiding places" are so well hidden that viral programs
infecting them would never have a chance to become active.
Therefore viri using them would have to "start" with normally
infected files or boot sectors.  The initial viral code would have
to provide the means to access the extra tracks or "extra-sector"
space, and then use the "hiding space" in order to store additional
code.  (This is, in fact, already happening to a limited extent.
The Joshi virus stores part of itself and the original boot sector
on an "additional" track.)

Some "hiding places", as mentioned above, are definitely a part of
the system, while not being, necessarily, obvious.  The Mac system,
for example, associates at least fourteen "resources" with each
program and data file.  Most of these resources can have code
associated with them, and therefore provide a number of additional
"hooks" for viral access.
