I know that. That's why a boot sector integrity checker should exclude
this area. But David mentioned the volume SERIAL NUMBER, not the
volume label... I didn't know that the serial number can be changed
with the LABEL command... Can't verify it now - I am running DR-DOS -
but I am pretty much convinced that it cannot...

Yes, of course, but as I said, anybody who is competent enough to do
that (especially if s/he knows the difference between using INT
25h/26h under DOS 4.x+ and the DOS versions below) is a power user and
shouldn't be surprised by a message the the boot sector has been
changed... Besides, it is trivial to make the integrity checker
exclude this area of the DOS boot sector from the integrity check...

Sounds like a very nice feature, unless it is not possible to turn it

No, they probably mean track 0, side 0, sector 1 of ANY drive... This
the boot sector on diskettes and the MBR on hard disks.

Obviously a canard! On hard-disks, Stoned is a MBR infector, hence it is
*never* in a partition. (There is only one MBR on any one HD, which is
outside of all partitions; rather, it defines the partitions.)

I do not know OSclean. But if it indeed tried to clean Stoned off
partitions (i.e. OS boot records), anything seems possible...

Yup, you are right. And there is one more possibility, which I figured
out myself after posting my message. A virus could infect a file with
a short filename and the user could rename it later to an extended
filename. If the scanner does not scan those files, then there is a
danger for reinfection.

I don't know what do you call logical and physical partitions on OS/2
using HPFS, but Stoned can infect only one thing - the Master Boot
Record of the hard disk. That is, the sector at track 0, side 0,
sector 1. It can be infected on any IBM PC compatible machine,
regardless whether it runs MS-DOS, OS/2, Unix, or whatever.

Some systems (Unix) may become non-bootable after the infection. On
other systems (OS/2) the virus will be unable to spread further, i.e.
to infect diskettes.

Yes there is a new 40-hex comming out, I am in-contact with a member

 Frisk,

 Thank  you for your comments on my Virus Simulator MtE Supplement. I'll  be
 mailing  the first copies january 1, so I hope your opinion  is  mistakenly
 based  on  my original Virus Simulator and not your technical review  of  a
 program you could not possibly have examined yet. Readers of this forum may
 recall  the  considerable  controversy and  strong  opinion  you  expressed
 beginning two weeks before my release of that program as well.

 Because of the security nature of the Virus Simulator MtE Supplement, it is
 only available directly from Rosenthal Engineering and you should not trust
 it  to  be harmless unless you can directly trace its source  to  Rosenthal
 Engineering without compromise. The Virus Simulator MtE Supplement is  only
 available  to  registered users of Virus Simulator, it  is  not  shareware.
 Registered users of Virus Simulator should be receiving the Virus Simulator
 MtE Supplement shortly, without additional charge.

 The  Virus  Simulator  MtE  Supplement compiles  a  test  suite  of  highly
 controlled,  safe test viruses and special dummy programs they will  infect
 (only).  The test viruses will only infect the special dummy test  programs
 generated by the Virus Simulator MtE Supplement. Provisions have been taken
 to  discourage modification and tampering. Both .EXE and .COM  viruses  and
 dummies  are  provided.  With the exception of  their  special  safety  and
 security provisions, the MtE test simulations are real polymorphic viruses.

 At  the hart of these MtE virus simulations is an actual Dark  Avenger  MtE
 mutation engine. The MtE engine provides virus writers with the ability  to
 turn  their relatively simple programs into very sophisticated  polymorphic
 viruses  which  are extremely difficult to detect by virus  scanners.  Each
 time  the  virus infects a host program it mutates, changes  its  signature
 pattern  to avoid recognition. A few examples of viruses that  employ  this
 same MtE engine are:

 Pogue,  Dame, MtE, Gotcha, 7S, Mut, Dedicated, Fear, Groove,  Coffee  Shop,
 MtE-Spawn, Questo, Crypto Lab, Encroach.

 Although  the  MtE  simulations  produced  by  my  program  are  safe   and
 controlled, they are real viruses, capable of infecting their special dummy
 host  programs. Vigilant anti-virus programs that are capable  of  reliably
 detecting the MtE mutation engine should report these simulations as  being
 infected.  Because these are real polymorphic viruses several  samples  are
 required  to validate a virus detector, as each time the virus  mutates  in
 attempt to avoid detection, its signature changes.

Hello Vesselin,

you wrote about TBCHECK:

 > It doesn't know about PATH companions.

Well, it won't let them through. If you have a validated file called
HELLO.EXE, and a path companion virus creates some HELLO.COM in a
directory listed in the DOS path, and you issue "HELLO" in a path
different from that one where HELLO.  EXE resides in, then TBCHECK
would give a warning like "HELLO.COM is not listed in the
ANTIVIR.DAT-File. Stop execution?". So it takes care of it. Of course
you're right with the other weaknesses (DOS file fragmentation, fixed
polynomial). The product is unfortunately not designed to stand a
directed attack, but it's a nice approach for a multilayer concept, I
think.

BTW: what do you think about the tunneling-stopping features of TBAV?
Do the utilities effectively stop tunneling? They e.g. prevented
TBSCAN from tracing to the BIOS entry point :-)) in version 5.01, and
when I executed the Tequila virus, TBAV said: TEQUILA.EXE tries to
trace to the BIOS entry point and advised me to reboot.

That's what I thought, too... Well, how does it manage to successfully
infect a file via 'standard methods' when TBAV is active, then? Any
other link virus I tested was stopped (I just have a few ones). For
example, the Cascade triggers the same warning ("This program tries to
remain resident in memory and is not confirmed to be allowed to do
this") as Armageddon, and when I allow it to go TSR, it tries to
infect COM files on execution - but is caught by TBAV. Armageddon is
not, it happily infects any COM file without any interception - why?

Thanks to all who wrote to tell me to use SYS.COM.  However, I don't
think that I would recommend SYS without the caveat that you may lose
some FAT information.  Areyah alludes to it in his response, and in
reality, there can be quite a bit of destruction.

CHKDSK can be pretty heavy-handed in doing FAT repair, so I would
suggest to anyone attempting to use SYS to remove a FORM infection:
Have your Disk Doctor (or whatever) handy 'cause you're going to need
it!

Again, thanks to all who responded...

This isn't really correct.  The /DISK option to VirStop causes it to
read the signatures from disk instead of loading them into memory, and
reduces the memory requirements from 12K to 2K.  It is true that there
is no way to swap out the 2K kernel, but that would almost be silly.

Otherwise a fine comparison.

There's nothing wrong with his operating environment; chalk this one up
to user error.  He's typing those lines at the command prompt -- DOS only
replaces environment variables when interpreting lines of batch files.
Put those lines in SCANIT.BAT and it would work.

(Try typing "echo %COMSPEC%" at the command prompt and see what you get.)

I'm cc'ing this solution to Craig.

If it isn't (i.e., if it is stored on a write-protected diskette),
then you don't need any cryptographic checksum, of course. But if it
is, you cannot just use plain MDx or any other known keyless
algorithm, because a virus could use the same algorithm to compute the
new checksum of the infected file and update the database of checksums,
so that everything will look OK... In these cases, you -must- have
some kind of key that is kept unknown to the virus.

Well, a CRC is usually computer like this:

        crc = INITIAL_VALUE;
        while ((c = getc (file)) != EOF)
                crc = crc_table [(crc & 0x00FF) ^ c] ^ (crc >> 8);

Usually INITIAL_VALUE is 0, but you could set it to anything you would
like...

You are right, I don't know whether it is secure enough. But you have
to do something with the keyless algorithms, if you want to achieve
different checksums for each user and not allow the virus to guess the
correct checksum of the modified object...

Gosh, how did you manage to get infected by this relatively not
widespread Russian virus?!

Right, SCAN 99 incorrectly reports two infections for this virus. If
there is enough interest, I could post a full list of viruses that
SCAN 99 detects as more than one.

The virus also infects SYS files. If F-Prot does not say this or if it
does not detect this, then it is a bug.

Sounds indeed like a bug in F-Prot to me... The virus is indeed
multipartite and infects boot sectors, COM, EXE, and SYS files. It
also does funny things to the source of the program AIDSTEST
(AIDSTEST.C), if it finds it... This is a Russian anti-virus program,
written by Lozinsky.

Well, I tend to agree with you, just maybe "not at all" is a too
strong expression. Depending on how exactly his dummy files are
generated, their detection might, or might not be connected with the
ability of a scanner to detect the MtE-based viruses. I suspect that
he's using the MtE itself to generate them. In this case, not
detection of one of them by a scanner does not necessarily mean that
the scanner will not detect the real virus, but in any case should
prompt further investigation...

Subject: Clearing out old signatures (PC)

Enclosed is a DEBUG script that will create a 68 byte .COM file
(CLEAR.COM) that will zero out memory between the current load
position and the TOM. To use, extract the portion of this message
between the (cut here) lines and name it CLEAR.DEB (the portion
beginning with "a100" and ending with the blank line after the
"q" - NOTE: that last blank line must be there as must the blank
line following "JMP 102".

Next run "DEBUG <CLEAR.DEB" When run there should be no errors.
This will create the program CLEAR.COM.

NOTE: It will not clear the disk buffers or any high/upper RAM
      nor will it remove any viruses that are properly resident
      in allocated space, it just clears free memory.

Weasel-words: this is FreeWare but carries no guarantee of fitness
              of any kind. Caveat etc.

Subject: "Beneficial" viruses

I believe that Fred Cohen, who is flogging his "beneficial" viruses
again, is being very mischievous, and doing the industry a great
deal of harm.  I gather that in fact these are not viruses at all,
in the sense that we use the term.  They may fit Fred's original
definition, but the modern definition makes much more sense, and it
is impossible for Fred to turn the clock back single handed, any
more than I can resurrect the original meaning of the word "gay".

Fred is well aware of this, but he persists in using the term
"virus" for his product, as he knows it will get him far more
publicity, but when you attack him he says 'Are you going to ban
FORMAT?', which, by his definition, is apparently a virus.

The trouble with this talk of 'good' viruses is that it provides all
the would be virus writers in our schools with the perfect
justification for their activities.  After all, if Dr. Fred Cohen is
selling 'good' viruses, why shouldn't they see if they can do the
same?

He makes the situation even worse when he announces that he has made
1500 viruses in an afternoon, and that this shows scanners are dead.
In the first place it shows nothing at all, as no one is interested
in viruses until they enter circulation, and in the second place it
provides evidence for the skeptics who believe that we amuse
ouselves in our spare time writing viruses to keep ourselves in
business.  Unfortunately there are already so many kids trying
to emulate Fred, that none of us have the time, let alone the need,
to write viruses.


Seasons Greetings to everyone.

Ok, I did not explain fully. This is a expansion of a discussion that
Ross Greenberg, Yisreal Radai, & I had in Virus-L about two years ago.

The complete concept did not use a single algorithm, rather it was
selected from a 3x3 matrix at the time of installation. Combine a 1 of
nine algorithm with a unique seed and you have a signature that is
difficult for software to forge - at least forging the signature would
be more difficult than breaking the mechanism.

First a sample matrix:

Row:         ROL  ROR  NOP
Column: XOR
        ADD
        SUB

In practise the code might select two to make things more difficult
& would look something like this for .COM files (stages would be needed
for .EXEs over 64k). CX contains the file size. DS points to the file in
memory.

Row:         ROL  ROR  NOP
Column: XOR  BX
        ADD       DX
        SUB


    XOR SI,SI
    MOV BX, sig1
    MOV DX, sig2
L1: LODSB
    XOR BL,AL
    ROL BX,1
    ADD DL,AL
    ROR DX,1
    LOOP L1

(please, no jibes at the algorithm - this is just an example)

Appending  BX to DX would produce a 32 bit signature. A final confusion
might be whether the order is BX-DX or DX-BX. Since we have three unknowns
(initial seed, algorithm, final order) that are selected at installation,
it becomes very difficult for malware to determine which is acually in use.

The easiest way is to compare a known program with its signature but even
there there are many crossing points & if the wrong branch is taken, the
forgery will fail. Further the process will have to start from scratch on
the next PC.

Now, it becomes easier for the malware to try to break the program than
to forge a signature so armoring is the next step.

The basic point is that the above code is very tight so performance
would not suffer (in tests I have been able to process nearly 64k/second
on a 4.77 Mhz 8088 PC). The selection process can take a little longer
since it is only done once.

The above is an example of quantum economics: the strenght of the algorithm
is matched to the speed of the process and the strength of the process
itself. IMHO there is no point in making the signature any stronger since,
unlike DES, it is never transmitted outside the PC it is used on (and,
in fact the user never needs to know what it is).

I trust this is sufficient explination.

Subject: Definition of computer virus (was FC on virus creation)

Hello everybody,

I was following for some time discussion about ethical correctness of
Fred Cohen's virus creation. It seems to me that most of dilemmas
arises from different understanding of term computer virus. I am
relatively new on this list, so don't know if the definition of
computer virus was properly discus- sed earlier and if some general
definition was accepted. If was I would like to know which one. I saw
different definitions in literature (I looked in the VIRUS-L FAQ too
:-))and would like to sublime what I've read till now in following
statement :

      Computer virus is set of instruction written with intention to
cause some unwanted function in system in which is currently situated.
Virus has ability of reproduction, it can propagate through different
media, may evolve over time and can mutate.

Is that correct definition ? I would really like to know one which
wouldn't lead to misunderstandings.
