Subject: TIME Magazine on "Cyperpunk": How Not to Define a "Worm"

In last week's TIME magazine (with the "Cyberpunk" lead article), RTM's
worm is is described as "not a virus, but a worm, since the damage was
unintentional".

This is the most singular lack of grasp of the subject I have seen in
a long time.

Subject: What is safe to discuss?

I have been reading (most of) the posts on this bulletin board <?> for
many months. One question that was recently raised was what kind of
information can be placed here. (The thing that inspired me to write this
was a comment responding to someone that posted a binary version of
a PKZIP authenticated file which had been tampered.)

We must have two kinds of people: those who think there should be no
restrictions (eg, posting virus code is okay) and those who believe
in some restrictions (to varying degrees) but NOBODY who posts here
believes that nothing about viruses should be posted here or THEY
wouldn't be posting here.

If an evil person (ie, virus writer and/or propagator) were to be
reading these messages, what would he (or she) want to read? I would
think that just about everything here would be useful to some extent.
For example, the constant discussion of polymorphic viruses would be
a great way to learn exactly how to write viruses that cannot (easily)
be detected. Many virus writers may not even THINK about polymorphism
until they read about it somewhere, like here.

Over the months I have learned a fair bit about viruses, and if I
were evil I could apply that new knowledge to writing viruses instead
of defending against them.

The point to my little soapbox is that secrecy is not the only or the
best way to defend against a threat. In some ways public discussion
can actually help, which is probably the reasoning behind the
existence of this forum. The more people know about viruses, the
more that people will be able to defend against them. And in some
cases the FAQ is simply not deep enough. As an evaluator of computer
security products (not focussed on anti-viral products) I find the
FAQ to be good but I could gain more from something more technical.
I ask myself, "Where do I go from here?"

I expect that an opposing viewpoint will focus on the question,
"How do we prevent the bad guys from getting educated?" I don't have
a good answer to that, since bad guys have a right to attend schools
like us good guys do. Personally, I believe strongly in censorship
of some things, but I'm not yet convinced that censorship of
virus-related information does much good.

Okay, if I'm wrong, sock it to me. :-)

Subject: Re: How to measure polymorphism

	I was thinking a little bit about polymorphism in both virus programs
and antivirus programs and got a few ideas about how one could go about
implementing it.

	If an antivirus program is not polymorphic,  it potentially can be
recognized and tampered with by a virus.  The code can be altered so it always
reads "clean",  or the files it keeps can be altered to delete signatures (for
scanners) or to change CRCs,  message digests,  whatever is used to protect
programs.  Therefore,  for safety,  an antivirus program should ideally be
different in every installation.  The filename should be different,  the code
should be different with ideally no scannable strings,  and any files that
it keeps should be in encrypted and/or variable format.  Encryption strings
especially must be stored in varying and hard to locate places.  (Of course
in real life,  we would hope that viruses never get smart enough to be
able to use nontrivial attacks on antivirus software...  Sure,  the present
generation of stealth viruses is pretty lame,  but when we get stuff like
Windows,  Windows NT,  and executables that keep growing and growing,  there
will be much more slack space for more complicated viruses.)

	Anyway,  it seems like the ideal way to make a program polymorphic
is to have a "polymorphic compiler".  One could,  say,  do all the parsing
at home and distribute (either in a virus or in an antivirus program) the
code tree and a code generator that always generates different code.  Maybe it
stores at least two ways to do every simple operation...  To make it worse,
it can randomize the order of subroutines and procedures,  and use all sorts
of transformations to really complicate the thing (Especially if the
"polymorphic language" is functional -- that would really be a blast of
course,  a functional language for systems programming).  One of course
could put the "source code" and the compiler on a floppy and have it install
the actual antivirus stuff in whatever incarnation on the disk,  using junk
off the disk,  the clock,  the CMOS ram and all that to start a RNG.  Viruses
would have both the polymorphic executable and the source code in encrypted
form,  maybe encoded with a one-time pad based on a randomly selected
segment in the program.  This kind of system would be really nasty to deal
with,  and worse yet,  might actually make non-lame stealth viruses practical.

	Let's face it -- the reason why stealth viruses are so easy to
defeat is that they pretty much need to have sections in memory that
are scannable.  The polymorphic compiler could conceivibly make the part of
a virus that plays hob with the operating system unscannable,  which would
be a pretty bad situation.

At the University of Cambridge (an early university), we permit a
certain amount of 'recreational use'.  However significant use of
resources or international networks requires approval from a
tutor/director of studies.  If an undergrad causes any trouble
(filling the job queue, sending abusive mail etc.) then to regain
access to any university-provided computer requires approval from the
tutor.

This has been roughly the policy since we built EDSAC (the first

This so-called article is in fact one chapter of the book "Approaching
Zero" by Bryan Clough and Paul Mungo. They are calling it "forthcoming
book" which sounds rather surprising to me - it was published in the
UK about one year ago and I have read it since a long time...

The book is not just about viruses, it is about computer crime in
general. It's a very entertaining reading and I recommend it.
Unfortunately, it is also full of technical and factual mistakes. In
fact, every story described there, for which I know how it actually
happened, there is something misrepresented in the book. In several
cases I know that the declination of the truth is deliberate, because
it was me who has told the authors some of the facts and they are
represented differently in the book...

The article is "Discover" does not make an exception - lots of
technical and factual details are wrong. Maybe the funniest of them is
the conjecture that "Diana P." in Dark Avenger's viruses has something
to do with Lady Diana, Princess of Wells. However, the general
analysis of the situation in Bulgaria that leaded to the creation of
so many viruses there is rather exact.

[Moderator's note: FYI, I think that's "Princess of Wales".]

Not necessarily. First, the child does not have to retain the full
functionatily of the parent. Consider a virus that carries a dozen of
video tricks as a payload and each 1,000 replications drops one of the
tricks (meaning that the next replicants do not contain the code for
that trick). For another example, see below. Second, you are assuming
that the virus is self-contained. I would argue that it is
theoretically possible to make it able to fetch code fragments from
the environment (e.g., the programs it infects) and use them to
upgrade itself in an unpredictable way. Sure, most of the upgraded
replicants won't work (i.e. will be sterile), but some of them might
be able to evolve further. After all, this is exactly how the
evolution works. Also, the percentage of the sterile progeny might
depend on some properties of the environment; e.g. in the Tierra
simulator almost any opcode is a valid instruction that can be
executed without crashing the program...

So, a virus can both reduce and increase its functionality.

OK, let's look at some real example like that. The Kampana virus. Most
people consider it multi-partite. I fact, this is a file infector,
which infects both files and boot sectors, but the part installed in
the boot sector can infect only other boot sectors. In some sense,
this is a file infector, which drops a boot sector virus. The
replicants of the boot sector virus are not able to infect files,
while the replicants of the file virus -are- able to infect boot
sectors... Therefore, what you claim above is not necessarily true -
any of the parts of a multi-partitie virus could have a reduced
functionality.

Exactly, but I fail to see how this fits in your arguments... Maybe
there is a typo something or I am missing something?

Well, some people argue that the Kampana virus is in fact two
viruses...

OK, let's try to find some other term, but not "duplicate"...

Yes, but they may not be predictable by examining the original...

Oh, I see, you mean that it somehow attaches itself to the process of
program execution... I misunderstood you because of the word
"intercept" - too much DOS-oriented thinking... :-) Yes, I agree with
the meaning you explain above.

Seems better. The only problem I have with it is the term "duplicate".

I don't think that this should be included in the definition and it is
not true, BTW... Or do you mean that they are -not- necessary? In this
case, why including them in the definition?

Subject: Help! Help, with FORM virus (PC)

Recently, a professor here armed his students with a custom program
written for him by a student programmer.  He had a secretary make
about twenty copies of the program for his students.  Unfortunately,
the secretary's machine was infected with FORM, a boot sector virus.
Now my student computer labs have been infected with it.

Our state legislature is slashing the university by 15 million
dollars, and up to 1000 staff positions may be lost.  The bottom line
is that I can't get approval to buy between $3500 - $4400 dollars
worth of software to protect my labs. Since the labs were being used
by people who respected copyrights, and generally weren't running
programs from their own diskettes, I had only seen one viral
infestation (on Macs) in my six years at the university.  The student
labs DOS machines up to this time had not been infected.

The low probabilty of infection kept my boss from approving a
comprehensive preventative solution.  I knew that eventually we would
be bitten.  During better times, I purchased a few copies of CPAV and
NAV to cover my office and to put one copy in each lab for the
exclusive use of my student lab consultants.  I sure as heck am not
going to violate the copyright of this software.

Although I would much rather buy enough licenses to cover my machines,
I am now trying to find public domain (and I mean FREE) software.
McAffee and Associates quoted me a whopping $17,000 dollars to site
license their products.  I might be able to wring out $5.00 to $10.00
per machine to license a product.  Is their anything out there, or am
I doomed to spend my life chained to a chair cleaning off FORM from
student diskettes?

There's one important characteristic of the Tremor virus which wasn't

Maybe so maybe not - you *probably* have an MBR virus but might not be
STONED.

First off, an active STONED (and most other infections) have two components:
a code segment that has replaced the MBR executable area stored on the
fixed disk, and an interrupt 13 intercept that has been loaded into memory
on boot. CLEAN removes the viral code from the fixed disk but does nothing
about the infection in memory, you must reboot from a clean disk to cure this.

Secondly, just because a scanner finds a virus in memory does not necessarily
meant that it is *active*. One thing that can happen is that when you do a
DIR of a floppy, the boot record is read into a buffer in low memory (fer
sure DOS 5.0 - am running tests on other versions). The scanners that I have
seen do not check to determine if the infection is *active* (being executed)
or is just present as data (could be done but non-trivial & they don't - yet),
rather, if a signature is found, a warning is triggered.

Thirdly, it is possible to have a double infection but this is unlikely.

>Questions: Why doesn't Untouchable work right?

Probably (a guess, do not have U-T) has to do with a "first-match" selection,
NO-INT and STONED share certain strings. Then again maybe you have "something
else".

>CAN the Stoned virus
>load into memory by a simple read from an infected floppy??

The binary code could be loaded this way but would not be active (but would
trip scanners).

Not that I am aware of.

If you choose Install.Install from the menu of F-PROT, you make a version

I have it in a copy of KERMIT I had been using on an old
IBM PC which doesn't have a hard drive.

Will it do any harm?  Can I get rid of the virus?

Just for your information:

Some of those words are from material by the Belgian techno/industrial
band  named 'Front  242'.  "Neurobasher"  is a  B-side  song from  the
"Tragedy For You" remix-maxisingle, and the sentence "Moment of terror
is  the beginning of life"  is  from the  inner  cover of  their album
"Front By Front" (I think).

The EpiCentre - and a virus named 'Tremor"...? ;-)

Subject: Michaelangelo's payload (PC)

Hello all,

It is known that the Michaelangelo virus makes use of INT 1Ah (AH=4)
to read the system date. It works on a 386, but fails on a XT (nothing
is returned).  The virus still works but the payload is never
achieved.  Is it due to an old BIOS ? Is there a *standard* way to
read the system date at *boot time* on a XT ?  If not, any virus that
uses the same function cannot work properly in such machines.

(Below the equator line the XT still lives...)

Thanks,
             Marcio Migueletto de Andrade
                                   Brazil.

Sounds like tbscanx !

on garbo.uwasa.fi there is a file in /pc/virus witch is called

tbav50?.zip this file contains a scanning pakage.  you also have to
download the signatures (vsig????.zip)

but this program is fully configurable (only shareware)

the tbav package has also a partition and bootsector imunizer ..
it might be an idea !

Subject: Help, which scanner? (PC)

Hi, I am relatively unknowledgable about virii.
My question is which scanner(s) should I use regularly
ie: new programs, boot up.

I am currently using Norton Anti Virus at boot up, and during windows
opperation with Norton Desktop for Windows 2.0.  I have installed the
latest Virus Definitions.

Thanks for any help.

Subject: Should scanners detect only common viruses? (PC)

Well, several people asked me by private e-mail to explain why I do
not think that scanners should be tested only against the viruses
known to be in the wild. Instead of replying to each of them
privately, I decided to post here.

There are several reasons:

1) A known-virus scanner is able to do only one thing - detect known
viruses. Nothing more. Because of that, it is a relatively weak
defense against viruses. Well, since it is able to do only that, then
it must do it -well- and detect -all- known viruses, or as many of
them as possible. 'Coz a known-virus scanner that does not detect even
the known viruses is an even weaker defense... :-)

2) Since the appearance of the virus exchange BBSes, there is no more
such thing as a "research-only" virus. Anybody with a PC and a modem
can call such a BBS and download heaps of "research" viruses and use
them to infect the computer of somebody he does not like... And if
this somebody depends on a known-virus scanner for virus protection,
and if this scanner detects only the 100 or so viruses that are
believed to be "in the wild", then the result could be rather
disastrous... Of course, the malicious person could write a completely
new virus from scratch and use it with the same disastrous effect,
even if the scanner on the attacked computer is able to detect all
known viruses. But, first, this proves nothing more than the scanners
ARE a weak defense against viruses and, second, it is still easier to
get a virus written by somebody else than to write your own.

3) "Viruses in the wild" is a rather fuzzy term. There are several
reliable sources of information about which viruses are in the wild -
for instance IBM, Virus Bulletin, Computer Crime Unit at Scotland
Yard, and some others. However, if you compare their data, you'll see
that they agree mainly on one thing - that only a small percentage of
the known viruses are in the wild. They don't agree on which viruses
exactly are in the wild. This is partly due to the fact that viruses
show some geographic prevalence. For instance, 95% of the infections
in Bulgaria are caused by the Dir_II virus. In most other countries
this virus has a status "sometimes found in the wild, but not very
common". According to IBM, Jerusalem is one of the most widespread
viruses in the USA. During my 3-year career of virus fighter in
Bulgaria, the number of Jerusalem infections that I witnessed there
can be counted on the fingers of one hand. In the same time, I have
observed at least one infection of Kamikaze and Anti-Pascal.605 in the
wild there - viruses that are so stupid that some anti-virus
researchers refuse to believe that they are able to survive at all...
So, when I am referring to "the known viruses", I have something
objective to stand on - a virus collection for each example of which
it can be objectively verified that it is indeed a virus and that it
is different from the other samples. I have no similar objective
criteria to decide what is a "virus found in the wild".

I tend to agree with those who claim that it is more important to
detect those viruses that are in the wild, than those that aren't. It
would be a good idea, when testing scanners, to assign some weights to
each virus, reflecting how widespread it is. A scanner that misses 200
(of 2000) viruses that nobody has ever seen in the wild is
definitively better than a scanner that detects all those 1,999
viruses, but misses Stoned.

However, while less important, the detection of non-spread viruses is
not -unimportant-. And since I have no objective criteria to decide
which viruses are widespread and which are not, I prefer to test the
scanners against all viruses that I have.
