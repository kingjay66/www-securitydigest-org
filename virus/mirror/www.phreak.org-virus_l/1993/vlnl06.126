	A hero? That sounds like quite an ego. I unassembled the Dark Avenger
virus some time ago, and admittedly, it is incredibly well-written, and
employs more methods to infect files than most other viruses, which is
why it has been one of the more successful and prolific viruses. In
fact, I can't help but admire this guy's programming ability. (BTW, for
those of you new to virus who are wanting to look at a good virus, I
think DAV is a good place to start!)

	But a hero? I think a more appropiate term to describe someone who
releases viruses into PD is "creep."

Subject: Still searching for Mr. Goodwin

I am looking for a person by the name of Jim Goodwin, who was active in
the virus area back in '89, as I am working on an article about the early
days of the anti-virus industry, and I would really like chat with him.

Jim Goodwin dropped from view around mid-year '89, I think, after publishing
some very interesting documents.  There is a rumour that he never existed at
all, (bu was just an alias of another well-known person), so even if anybody
could just confirm his existence, that would help.

Warning, wannabe evaluators! Please, have in mind the following:

1) If you intend to evaluate an anti-virus package and publish the
results, begin with publishing the details of your evaluation
procedure. Just saying "Product XYZ is OK" expresses only your
subjective view and doesn't help anybody. When people see how you are
evaluating the products they will be able to (a) decide whether the
points interesting to them are investigated carefully enough and (b)
spot mistakes in your evaluation procedure.

2) If you don't have a good knowledge about and experience with
computer viruses, it is better if you leave the evaluation to somebody
who is a specialist in the field. A professional evaluation of an
anti-virus product is a very tricky thing, and even professional
computer security experts happen to goof sometimes when it comes to
computer viruses.

For a general discussion of the subject, see Sara Gordon's paper
"Evaluating the Evaluators" in Virus News International.

Is it? I have not had any experience with this product, but according
to the review in Virus Bulletin, it is quite slow and has serious
problems in detecting polymorphic (e.g., MtE-based) viruses.

Another good side of F-Prot is its high disinfection rate. One of the
bad sides is that the resident scanner (VirStop) has problems with
DR-DOS 6.0.

> Dr. Solomons - information ok

What limitations? This scanner has one of the highest detection rates
I have ever seen. The integrity checker is extremely bad, however.

"Wary"? The detection rate is -miserable- and the program is
sloooowwww...

Anybody can evaluate that, even the users themselves. The tricky part
is to evaluate how well does the product protect from viruses...

Subject: Viruses on CD-ROMs?

I have the responsibilty for anti-virus policy here, and am faced with a
new challenge: CD-ROMs.

There are at least three types of ROMs that have emerged-

    Collections of free/shareware.
    Promotional disks
    "Shrink-wrap" products

The first is easy: treat each extraction from the disk as if it were from
an FTP server or BBS - i.e. check it on extraction/download.

Promotional disks are more of a problem - they include some free stuff,
some demo programs, some things that install themselves on your hard
disk, etc. etc. A mess, in other words.

Shrink-wrap is more of a problem. We currently do scan shrink-wrap
software coming in on floppies. We have our own shrink-wrap machine
here, so can't be too careful :-)

Have there been any reports of viruses on CD? Has anyone else been
through this and come to some sort of conclusion?

I'm mostly thinking of MS-DOS here, but I guess the Macintosh people may
have more experience, since CDs have been in that field longer.

The Stoned virus most certainly DOES infect the boot sectors of logical
drives.  As soon as you access the drive (in this case, probably drive
D:), it will be infected.  WARNING:  Do not use FDISK/MBR for this.
In some situations it will simply delete the partition.

Most virus cleaners will clean the virus out of there.  If yours does
not, use Thunderbyte.  It works.

Subject: [PC] FORM virus infection. (PC)

I'm new to this list so please excuse if this is a rather dumb
question.
We have just been hit by FORM on several computers but it seems to
behave in a 'different manner' to which we would expect.
According to the documentation we have it such make keys click on the
24th but it doesn't, it does however stop one computer from booting,
a cause random crashes on others. Two computers which have read
infected disks do not seem to be infected at all. THe SCAN/CLEAN
combo seems to work however.
So my query is - what is the effect of this virus, could any files be
damaged?

Andy.

Subject: Re: Bait files (PC)

uqitu01 (uqitu01@ucl.ac.uk) writes:

> I observe increasing reference to the use of "bait files" as a means
> to detect virus activity. What more specifically are bait files?

"Bait files" (or "goat files" or "victim files") are small (well,
usually) do-nothing programs, the only raison d'etre of which is to be
infected by viruses. And example of such file is

code	segment
	assume	cs:code
	org	100h
start:	jmp	quit
	db	(1000-8) dup (90h)
quit:	mov	ax,4C00h
	int	21h
code	ends
	end	start

When assembled, the above source will produce a 1000-byte file,
containing mostly NOPs (90h), which exits as soon as it is executed.

Bait files have two main applications. First, it is much easier to
disassemble a virus attached to a short bait file with a known
contents, than if it is attached to, say, a copy of the Borland C++
compiler... :-) Also, the virus samples occupy less space in a virus
collection, if they are attached to short host files. That's why, most
anti-virus researchers, when they get a new virus, try to replicate it
and to attach it to a bait file.

The second application has something to do with integrity checking
programs. These programs compute the checksums of the different
executable objects in the computer system and compare those checksums
with a known database of checksums of those objects when they are
uninfected. Since infecting them will change their contents, the
checksums of the infected objects will not be the same any more and
will lead to the detection of the virus, even if this is a new,
unknown virus, missed by the scanners.

Unfortunately, there is a kind of attack against the above scheme. It
is called "slow viruses". Those viruses install themselves in the
computer memory and infect only those files that are being modified
(or created). Since such files will have a different contents and
checksum, and since the user knows that fact, s/he will probably not
pay attention to the message that the file has been modified and the
infection will remain unnoticed.

The only solution is to create/modify a few files with a -known-
contents, to compute their checksum, and to verify whether it is what
it should be. For this purpose, some integrity checking programs
create, copy, modify and execute a few bait (do-nothing) files with a
known contents (e.g., 1000 NOPs), in a hope that the virus (if one is
present) will infect them. Then a checksum of those files is computed
and it is compared with a known one (the program knows what the
checksum of a file containing only 1000 NOPs will be).

(Note: the number 1000 in the above discussion is just an example;
usually a whole set of different file lengths is used.)

> What
> characteristics do bait files have that make them more succulent and

> frequently-used application programs or operating system executables?

Nothing. The viruses don't infect them more eagerly than the "normal"
files; most of them infect them in the same way as any other files.
Actually, some viruses try to avoid infecting bait files, by setting a
set of conditions to which the infectable files must conform. (E.g., if
the file seems to consist of one and the same byte repeated over and
over, or if the file begins with a JMP to the end, and so on.)

Yes. It's a rather unremarkable MBR infector of Polish origin. Infects
the boot sector of diskettes and the MBR of hard disks. The original
boot sector is moved to cylinder 0, side 0, sector 6 on hard disks and
to the last sector of the root directory on floppies. It is not
intentionally destructive and in fact has no payload at all. Can be
removed with FDISK/MBR (from DOS 5.0 or higher) from the hard disk.

In our tests, F-Prot has been able to disinfect Form quite reliably.
It could be that you have some new variant, or it is a false positive.
Do you happen to use some other anti-virus products, like
VSAFE/CPAV/MSAV?

This is version 2.1. The version number can be seen in plaintext in
the infected files (along with other text and greetings to Dr. Cohen
and the author of Diet), if you decompress them with Diet or UNP.

Exactly as well as Diet would have compressed them - the algorithm is
stollen directly from there. (Well, actually the compression will be
slightly worse, because the virus infects the file first.)

An excellent example, demonstrating why a "good virus" is usually a
bad idea. Modifying the user's files is generally a bad idea, unless
you know perfectly well what you are doing. And making a
self-replicating buggy program is much worse than just releasing a
buggy program.

The author too... :-) I mean, both viruses are written by the same
author.

That's in the FAQ (question F3). The Latin word "virus" (=poison) does
not have a plural form (like "air" in English). "Viruses" is an
English form. The people who use the form "virii" usually apply the
rule that says that Latin words ending in "-us" end in "-ii" in plural
(e.g., "radius" -> "radii").

As the FAQ says, "Please use 'viruses,' and if people use other forms,
please don't use VIRUS-L/comp.virus to correct them." :-)

Don't you mean "Keypress", by any chance? It is described in our

Hello:

   Two days ago, I downloaded vshield 108 from mcafee.com but this version
still has the /lh bug.  Im using qemm 7.01 and vshield says there is not
enough high ram to load (it says it needs 198 KB!!!).  I know I can loadhi
vshield by using DOS=UMB, but QEMM manual says dont use that option!

   I want to use vshield without using DOS=UMB, just like vshield 106 did it.
Is there any other suggestion to loadhi vshield with QEMM 7.01?

                                        Thanks in advance

Subject: Michaelangelo and 3 1/2 inch drive (PC)

I was having some wierd problems with a 3 1/2 inch floppy which were
apparently caused by the Michangelo virus!?

Briefly, the computer was originally set up with the 5 1/4 inch drive as
A: and the 3 1/2 as B:, and I wanted to reverse them. Whenever I
configured the 3 1/2 to be A:, all data on any non-write protected disk
was corrupted as soon as the disk was accessed, even by just entering
"DIR A:". On the first and every subsequent access, I would get "Abort,
Retry, Fail?". This happend whether or not the 5 1/4 inch was configured
as B:.

I had no problems with the 5 1/4 inch, whether it was configured
as A: or B:. I had no problems with the 3 1/2 inch configured as B:. I
gave up on switching the drives, and lived with the 3 1/2 as B: and the
5 1/4 as A:.

One slow day, I ran a virus scanner on the system, and it said it had
the Michaelangelo virus in the disk partition table (boot sector). I ran
a cleaning program and got rid of the virus.

Just for the heck of it, I switch the drives again, configuring the 3
1/2 as A: and the 5 1/4 as B:. Believe it or not, I've been running for
weeks with no problems. I have to conclude that the virus was the
problem.

Subject: MtE Virus (PC)

	Twice in the last month, I have received a warning from Norton
Anti- Virus's 2.1 Intercept, that my image file for Pctools was
infected with MtE.  Both times I stopped the file execution, and went
to scan.  however, Norton's Virus Clinic has never been able to find
the virus anywhere on my drive.  I intentionally did not reboot, so
the virus should have been there.  I scanned the original Pctools
disks, and they are clean, and I also scanned with my original Norton
disk, in case the program was infected.  Both turned up nothing.  Am I
getting a false positive?  And why can the Intercept find it, but the
clinic turn up nothing?  Don't they use the same virus information?
	I've always used Norton Antivirus, and now use v2.1. However,
I see no mention of it here.  Is this program still sufficient
protection, or should I try and find a different program?  I've always
liked Norton, but if it doesn't do the job, I can't afford to keep
using it.

Subject: VIRUS ? (PC)

Hello there,

I have a problem. Lately when I work with Word Perfect (don't start to laugh) I
notice that some characters in a file has been changed since the last time
I used that same file.

By example: the 'n' is changed into a 'j' and the 'o' is
changed into the 'k'.

Also some programs, like Civilization and Roger Rabbit, hang while I am
playing them. When I compared the files of Civ. on my harddisk and the
original files I noticed that the only difference appeared in the file
civ.exe. The difference was that the one file contained 5B and the other
5F.

Although I used almost "every" scanprogram (svanv108, TBAV, FPROT), no
program can detect a virus.

Do I have a virus? If so, what sort of virus and what van I do against
it? Are there any other scanners who might recognize "my virus"?

Or do I have a problem with my hardware?

Richard.

this may be the wrong place to post this, but please, please

my university doesn't do ibms.  the only anti-virus software that's
available here (VIRx) is old doesn't seem to catch the virus i seem to
have (does a virus that inserts obscenities into the end of a text file

virus, so i ftp over to oak.oakland.edu and pick up killmonk.zip, plus
the two unzipping programs oak recommends to unzip files, unz50p1.exe
and pkz204g.exe.

when i attempt to execute these files in dos, i get the following error
messages:

	unz50p1 tells me there's a HeaderC error
	pkz204g tells me there's been an attempt made to execute
an invalid instruction, and that i should probably reboot my system.

cluelessly, i download these files again, but get the same messages.  (well,
at least it's consistent... ).  i'm just learning about dos and such, so
these messages mean nothing to me.

can anyone please, please help?

This will be corrected readily.  In the meantime, if you have this

Recently I purchased the upgrade to Symantec's Norton Utilities v7.0
for use with my personal PCs and discovered a number of oddities that
make it seem as if it is not supposed to be a technician's tool any more.

The first is just an annoyance: few of the programs will run without the
NLIB100.RTL (run time library) a 200k file (I thought the use of RTLs went
out with BASIC interpreters).

The second is a real bother: most of the NU7 programs will not run on an
8088 or 8086 CPU. All you get after lots of disk gnashing is a message to
that effect. This makes it essentially unusable to a technician particularly
since software upgrading generally includes an implied agreement not to
use earlier versions. Thus keeping 5.0 or 6.0 (which work on 8088s) when
upgrading for $49.00 to 7.0 may be illegal. Forget It.

Subject: Infection of "New Stoned variant" (PC)

I have found several cases these past two weeks of a virus infection in on of
our departments of a "New variant of Stoned" as reported by Fprot 2.09d.
The first encounter was with three infected diskettes.  They were completely
unreadable (i.e., the directory was there, but copying the files resulted in
a list of one-byte files).  F-prot detected a virus present but could not
remove it.  Running Norton Disk Doctor, version 7.0 and 6.0, I could not repair
the FAT, boot record, nor directory structure.  I suggested that the use who
brought this to our help desk reformat those diskettes.

The second case occurred soon after that.  Since we have been virus-free for
quite a while, we were a bit lax on our procedures, so one of our hard drives
ended up being infected.  This proved to be a good thing.  Again, F-prot
detected this as a "new variant of Stoned" and could not remove it.  When I
booted from a clean floppy after powering off and on the machine, I could no
longer read drive C: (but a reboot from drive C: worked fine).  That told me
right there that it most likely IS a virus, and not some anomalous program.
I then rebooted from a clean floppy, and ran Norton Disk Doctor, version 6.0.
It detected that the partition table was corrupted, and offered to repair it.
I told it to go ahead, and it repaired it with no problems.  After that, the
drive scanned clean with F-prot.

The reason this was a good thing is that we got another call from the same
department that brought us the diskettes.  Two hard drives in their lab were
infected (more were not infected because they use VIRSTOP in their lab!) and
they had no idea how to fix it...using FDISK did not remove the virus.  So I
went with my kit, rebooted vrom a clean floppy, and tried Norton Disk Doctor
version 6.0 again.  Again, it cleaned off the two drives painlessly.

Since I've looked through all literature I have on viruses, and have followed
every procedure I know of to detect and remove this virus, and still cannot
identify it, can I get some feedback on what this could have been?  If I can
get an answer about this, I will be reasonably sure that a near-future version
of F-prot will remove this.

Notes:
   1.  FORMAT /MBR did not work because the machines I tried this on did not
       support the /MBR option.

   2.  Since FDISK did not remove the virus, I assumed that their version of
       DOS was infected as well.  But I am not sure of this as the people in
       that department's lab are very competant and know the correct procedures
       for removing viruses.

   3.  Since Norton disk Doctor removed it easily from a hard drive, I assume
       that the copy of the partition table was in an unused area of the
       directory table.

   4.  I do not have a "live" copy of this virus.  Since removing the virus
       had a higher priority, I worked on that problem first.  In retrospect
       I now wish I had been able to get a copy.

   5.  I assume the floppies were unrecoverable because the boot sector was
       copied to a used area of the FAT, which confused NDD too much.

Thanks for your ear, and I hope to hear from someone soon.

Subject: Tunnelling (CVP)

DEFGENC.CVP   930908

                            Tunnelling

Somewhat related to stealth technology is the concept of
"tunnelling".  Again, this is a technology, not a virus per se, and
one that is used in both viral and antiviral programs.

To examine the concept of tunnelling, let me go back a bit in
computer history.  Before there were viri, there were trojans.
Anti-trojan software was generally of the activity monitoring and
operation restricting variety, similar to a number of antiviral
programs today.  Activity monitors do not really monitor activity.
They place traps and interrupts at certain points in the operating
system.  Certain system calls are either potentially dangerous
themselves (such as the function that formats a disk) or are
precursors to dangerous activities.  Therefore, when a program calls
one of these functions, the activity monitor is triggered.  Again,
this relies upon the fact that operating system functions *must* be
made available in a known location so that valid programs can use
them.

Activity monitors, as we have said, place traps at the location of
potentially dangerous system calls.  These traps are generally
pieces of code which run the activity monitor program, rather than
the original operating system code.  The activity monitor can then
alert the user, and the user can choose to stop the action, or to
allow the action, in which case the original operating system code
is run.

This means that the activity monitor has performed a very virus-
like action.  It has made a change to the original state of the
system.  Since the state of the system is generally well known, a
virus can be written to examine these system entry points.  The
virus can "tunnel" or trace back along the programming associated
with the system call.  If an activity monitoring program is found
(and this generally means anything other than the original operating
system code) the trap can be reset to point to the original system
call.  The activity monitoring program is now bypassed, and will
*not* trigger--at least not for that particular function.

This same type of activity can be used against viral programs.  Viri
often trap certain system calls in order to trigger infection
activities and so forth.  Antiviral software can tunnel along the
various interrupts, looking for changes.  Viral programs can thus be
disarmed.

Tunnelling may seem like a lot of work to go to in order for a virus
to defend itself.  Indeed it is.  One particularly well known, and
widely marketed, antiviral has a resident component.  Only seven
bytes of code are required to disable it.  Not to tunnel around it,
but to disable it completely.  (Viral programs are also becoming
more aggressive.  One has been found which takes action to disable
or cripple no less than fourteen antiviral systems ... )
