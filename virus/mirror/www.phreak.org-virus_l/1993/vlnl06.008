Subject: Heuristic Scanners

 Would someone please post information on heuristic scanning theories.
I'm looking to develop my own scanner and as such want to develop some
software that attempts to thwart these scanners.

 I'm new to this, so any help would be greatly appreciated.

 Also, does any know if Mark Washburn has a mailing address?

 Thanx

Subject: Benign "viruses" (addendum)

As an addition to my earlier post about a protocol for adding benign
virus or wormlike programs to a system: the protocol could (probably
should) be modified to require transmittal of the program in source
form only - that way the target system would always have to compile
the program to install it, and a copy could be made of the source
before compilation so that if something did go awry, the source would
be there to examine. I mention making a copy because it would be
possible for the program, if malicious, to modify the copy that was
sent, but if sufficient care were taken, an automated process could
make a copy that would not be able to be found by the program once
compiled and running.

Fred Cohen can point with justified pride to the mathematical theory
of viruses.  At the same time, I think it is perfectly understandable
that people will use more relative, subjective critera based on a
perception of risk and intention. This is especially the case since
one of the consequences of the mathematical theory is a proof that a
general "unknown virus" detector is impossible!

Looking at Mac viruses (with which I am more familiar), the majority
do not appear to have been written to do deliberate harm.  However,
they all also contain bugs and undesirable side-effects which cause
them to be harmful.  It is the pragmatic difficulties of writing
self-replicating code which remains both functional and controlled in
unknown environments that makes me (and others) skeptical of the
usefulness of "benevolent" viruses. (And I am *not* speaking of backup
programs.)

The information necessary to write a virus is available to any
compentent programmer -- it does not take a genius.  At the same time
most anti-virus workers are concerned with broadcasting the details of
viruses. I would not attribute this to a desire for censorship but to
the pragmatic observation that "copy-cat" viruses are a serious
problem and that it may be a good idea not to lower the threshold of
effort needed to create a virus.

Until mathematical theory provides a means for apprehending the
writers of viruses, some folk will have to get their hands dirty...

Interesting question - which is more efficient? This is exactly the
reason we should prefer viruses in some applications and not in others.
By bringing up this issue, are you implying that if viruses do it better
we should use them?

That's right - any time we design an automated system, there are risks
that the automation may do something undesired.  This is true of all
automation - viral or otherwise - so it's not a valid reason for ruling
out viruses as a useful technology.  Rather, we must consider the risks
against the gains on a case by case basis.

	How should we react to your allergy? Should we remove your
immune system because it can kill you? That's the position you take if
you say we should not have a viral immune system if it has the potential
of killing the host.  Should we kill all bees to protect you? This would
kill certain flowers, which in turn could impact other elements of the
environment, and eventually, it might kill everyone! Should we allow you
to die some day to protect the rest of the world's population? Or
perhaps - we should do research to figure out how to make your immune
system better! That's what the people who advocate viral immune systems
in computers propose - and frankly, it sounds better to me than a lot of
(but not all) the alternatives I can think of for virus defense.

Y. Radai and V Bontichev discuss keys and checksums:

	I think that an alternative to off-line checksums is access
control. This has worked in IT for several years, and defeats all of the
other attacks against the crypto-checksum I am aware of.  Obviously, we
can bypass the access controls in a normal DOS environment, but that
doesn't invalidate the concept.

Yes - Tim - this works quite well.  A similar system has been operating
effectively for several years without a problem.  Perhaps you are a
better virus researcher than many of the others we hear from - you aren't
as context bound.

Arthur L. Rubin writes about my definition of viruses:

>Actually, that definition isn't useful.  If the "environment" includes
>a user typing "copy", then any file is a virus.

	I disagree strongly.  You are right that under my definition, if
the environment is such that all programs are always copied, then all
sequences of symbols are viruses.  I published this result in 1985 in
some detail, and showed a Turing machine example where all sequences are
viruses.  You are not right that just because one user copies one
program one time, it makes the copied program a virus.  The reason is
that the copied program won't necessarily copy itself when you run the
copy.  That is the reason we have the `ad infinitum' at the end of the
linguistic version of the definition.  To qualify as a virus, given a
proper environment, the program must ALWAYS reproduce.

	This brings up the issue of `partial viruses' which only
replicate under particular conditions.  In brief, the conditions may be
considered part of the environment, and thus in certain environments,
the program is a virus, and in others it is not.  But this is not
unusual at all, since all sequences are viruses in some environments,
and no sequence is a virus in some environments.  A virus under DOS is
not necessarily a virus under Unix, and a virus that requires a Windows
environment isn't a virus in systems that don't include the Windows
environment.  That's why we need different virus scanners for Unix than
for DOS.  It is also one reason that general purpose virus detection is
undecidable: we have to consider a potentially infinite number of
different languages that can interpret information, not just the binary
form used by the hardware.

	A side effect of the definition is that in order to discuss
viruses, we also must discuss environments.  For example, the
Christma.Exec virus spread largely because of a corporate culture where
people send their friends fancy Christmas cards via computer mail.  If
it weren't for the culture, the program might not have replicated.  The
same is true of the Internet virus.  The environment that allowed this
virus to spread included a debugging option that allowed unlimited
privileges without any authentication.  If the environment did not
include that circumstance, the Internet virus would not have replicated,
and it would therefore not have been a virus.  That's why we talk about
DOS viruses as opposed to MAC viruses, Windows viruses, etc.

Yes, but you can define some kind of initial value for any
implementation of the algorithm... For instance, you could prepend
N-bit key to the file before computing CRC-N. Not secure, I know. See
below.

It doesn't add any security - this is BTW exactly what I stated in my
initial message - that for CRC-type algorithms it is not enough to use
a different seed - you need to change the generator each time.

BTW, it would be interesting to see an analysis of the table-driven
checksum algorithm presented by Padgett Peterson and Ross Greenberg...

Yes, of course, I agree that one way to fix the keyless algorithms is
to use key-dependent algoritms... :-) I was just talking about what to
do, if you want to use a keyless algorithm... ANSI X9.9 is derived
from DES, right? I just thought that MD4 is fater than DES and still
cryptographically strong, so one could use it, if s/he wants to use a
cryptographically strong algorithm at all...

Now, now. There are many examples of definitions that would be
"senseless" to Fred Cohen, but probably work really well for most of
the rest of the world. In South Africa, for instance, there exists a
fundamental road law which may be paraphrased as "Drive on the left".
Er, although this depends on which window of the car you look out of
[and the law does *not* specify], it's very much a sensible, working
definition of how to orient your car when driving. OK, the definition
would be unviable in the USA, but you can't have everything...

...and hit the nail on the head. See Alan Solomon's article in a
recent Computers and Security in which he "overloads" Fred Cohen's

that the word "virus" will be used to denote "Real Virus". All is

No, no OS/2 call does an INT 21 at all; that's one of the main
reasons that no DOS virus runs in native OS/2.  Operating system
calls in OS/2 are done using Protect Mode constructs like call
gates (I forget the details again!), not using INTs.       DC

Subject: DOS Viruses under HPFS (OS/2)

 Being a virus researcher myself, I find it sometimes suicidal to test
out and disassemble new stealth and polymorphic class viruses on my
DOS based PC. I'm deathly paranoid that it's going to escape on one of
my floppies and infect the rest of my house... Even though I know my
ASM a bit better than the average Joe, who knows what might happen.

 As a result, I'm looking to find an environment suitable for testing
viruses. I was considering OS/2, however I do have one question.

 If you are testing a virus in a DOS window and it "goes off" so to
speak (If it has a destructive nature...), will it trash the entire
system, or just mess up the DOS window (Theory states that it should
only mess up the DOS window... But can someone vouch for this?)

 I've been using Flushot + to "monitor" the progress of viruses under
testing, however, I'm finding alot more viruses now that are hostile
to AV programs.

 Any input would be greatly appreciated...

This was due to a bug in UTScan.  I'm told it will be fixed in Version
27.

UTScan (like the rest of the Untouchable package) is, as you probably
know, developed in Israel.  Israeli subscribers automatically get
updates at the beginning of each even-numbered month, so we have had
Ver. 26 for over a month now.  I have no idea when updates reach the
U.S. market, but I presume there's a delay of a week or more.
  Btw, starting from Ver. 27 (or maybe 28), the version number will no
longer reflect the date of the scan patterns.  This will be reflected
in updates to a file called VIR-INFO (which replaces the file BRM.VRB)
[hope I got that right].

Yep!  When it sees a three-key reboot, it attempts to simulate a

sucsessful, and this is therefore yet another way that the Joshi can

the virus Naughty Hacker-1. The Nav program says to boot with a disk
which has the same system, which in this case is ms-dos 3.3. That i
have done...

however, doing so, the nav program is not able to recognize the virus...

What should i do?

Another funny thing is happening: if i take the ainsi.sys out of my
config.sys file, the nav isn't able to find the virus...

I would really appreciate if someone could help me concerning this
virus..  what can he do to my computer? how can i get rid of it?...

Thank you in advance...

Subject: Problems with PCs (PC)

I am having massive virus problems, and I hope someone here might be
able to help me out. After having some problems with my computer:
sharing violations on the hard drive, and overflow errors, I decided
to do a virus check. I got Scan v.99, but found that every time I
downloaded it and tried to run it, I got a "damaged file" error. I
tried my roommates computer, and was able to download scan and run it
with no problems. I assumed I had some sort of virus, so I read the
scan info and tried to run scan off of a write-protected disk. Sure
enough, a disk access was attempted and I hit fail to try and continue
running scan. This seemed to work, but scan did not find any viruses
in memory or on my hard drive. I was screwing around on my roomates
computer and was transferring some of his files to one of my disks. I
ran scan again, and THIS time it told me that I had the "filler" virus
in memory and to run Clean on my roommates HD. However, I did not have
Clean, so I re-booted off a clean floppy that he had and I ran Scan
again. However, this time no problems were found. Yet, I started
getting the same errors on his computer that I had on mine. I got
Clean, but I did not have any success trying to get rid of the virus:
Scan won't find anything anymore and Clean is damaged even when I boot
off a clean floppy that has no autoexec or config.sys. I think both
our computers are infected, but I can't find a trace of the virus. We
both run stacker--does this make a difference? If anyone could provide
me with any info regarding the "filler" virus or of any better virus
killers out there I would greatly appreciate it -- I spent 3 hours
tonight screwing around on 2 computers and have had NO success.
Thanks, and please reply by e-mail if possible....  --

I think the idea in OS/2 is to allow the *same partition* to be
bootable into OS/2 or DOS. Clearly, changing the MBR won't help. I
have some code which lets me do the same kind of
same-partition-various-OSes with MS-DOS 3.30 and DR-DOS 6.0, which I
like to swap between. Rewriting the DBR is required...

A further excellent reason for using the Big Red Switch is to be found
in a virus such as Anticad -- here, the virus has certain phases of
operation in which a warm boot will trigger the virus' destructive
code.

The thing to remember is that Crtl-Alt-Del is merely a trappable
trigger for a "warm boot" [ie: one in which no memory check is
performed]. Any program can take over C-A-D as a hotkey for itself
[eg: SmartDrive, I gather, which does so to ensure it flushes its
write cache before allowing the reboot..], so *any* keyboard-based
reboot trigger should be assumed dangerous when you suspect a virus in
memory. Hit the button instead..

Subject: New way of opeing files??? (PC)

 Apparently, there is a new way of opening files which some AV
Utilities don't catch. I've heard that the NuKE group is starting to
use function AX,6C00h/INT 21h to open files... Can anyone confirm the
use of this function and are there any AV programs that trap this
function?

         this product may detect viruses that this scanner
