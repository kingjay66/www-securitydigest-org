I was informed that the self-extract VESA.EXE in TM411-4.ZIP
contains two virus-infected VESA drivers:

    OAK\37VESA.COM
    OAK\67VESA.COM

They can be detected by F-PROT.

If you have them in your directories, please erase them
immediately. This is the only known method to remove the
virus. I shall post further details as soon as I received
more information from the author of F-PROT.

This is no virus inside Telemate and GIFLink. Only the two
VESA drivers are inflected.

As a result, I removed those drivers and upload TM411-4A.ZIP
to our support BBSs, distribution sites, EXEC-PC and
Channel-1, with the following description:

TELEMATE 4.11a, Powerful comm program, 4 of 4 This new part

OAK\67VESA.COM from the self-extract VESA.EXE. Please remove
TM411-4.ZIP from your BBS and use this clean TM411-4A.ZIP.

Please help to spread this message and STOP distributing
TM411-4.ZIP. Thank you very much.

Subject: More fun and games from Central Point....

  Central Point seems determined to cut off their nose to spite
their face. From an article in _Communications Week_, 6/21/93:

[Tori Case, a manager at Central Point Software, Inc.]
  "We need to send a very clear message to the perpetrators of
computer crimes: writing and intentionally distributing viruses
is illegal, and those who do so will go to jail."

  I wonder if Ms. Case realizes that this would make it illegal for
a person to send them a sample ("intentionally distributing") of
an infected program for analysis (not to mention sending one to
other companies as well). Not real good for business, IMHO.

  McAfee disparages part of the problem as being "these hackers [who]
collect and trade viruses like baseball cards". I guess he doesn't
want customers to be able to validate his software, since that's
the reason we keep a few around here (and don't bother asking for
copies, we don't even distribute them within the company). Wonder
what penalties he wants to assess for possession of a virus? 10 years
in the federal penitentary? A court order to use nothing but SCAN?
Forfeiture of the possessors' computer?

  It's amazing how some people in this industry lose touch with
reality so easily...

This is a rather old problem and it usually is the result of having
used a BSI infected floppy (even though the PC did not become infected)
immediately previously. This leaves the virus code in the boot record
buffer (in low memory) and this disconnected code is what SCAN detects.
That SCAN does not report the detected virus until the SCAN is complete
(so it looks as if it is in high memory) has also been documented.

Incidently v105 is the current version (haven't checked for this yet though).

Subject: LRICK Virus? Help! (PC)

Can anyone tell me about the LRICK virus? A colleague of mine just bought a
Compaq laptop and somehow managed to find this virus at startup. I am a
Macintosh consultant, but I claim no specific knowledge of the mysterious
DOS world. His machine is a 4/120 configuration and is running DOS 6.0 and
Windows. He DOES have MS Anti-Virus, but obviously, it needs to be updated.
Is there anywhere one of us can download information or an update for MS
Anti-Virus? Or is there a known fix he could try?

Thanks for any suggestions,

Subject: PC: Stoned (Standard) and F-Prot (PC)

I just encountered a disk which F-Prot 2.08a identified as having
Stoned (Standard), and promptly refused to disinfect it. Is this a
new strain of Stoned that hasn't been fully examined yet, or is
this a problem that I've not seen encountered here yet?

We were, of course, able to disinfect via other means, but if
we've got a new strain of Stoned out there, I need to let my
colleagues know about it quickly.

Thanks for an e-mail response.

Then I gather that by classifying ?safe as a 'daily pill', you almost
completely disqualify on-line protections... Note that I say almost, because
some DO serve their purposes.

When I got my 200Mb, it took me exactly 4 seconds to understand that backing
that up on disks is hopeless... So I got myself a Collorado 60/120 Backup Tape,
and as far as I am concerned now, my harddisks can fry for as long as they
like, PROVIDED I have the most recent backup with me.

One of my biggest fears ever, was not losing my computer. (as opposed to what
everyone thinks :-) ). My fear was losing all my sources and programs. What I
didn't write, someone else has. What I wrote, either one of the commercials or
not, no one else might have, and it would be exceptionally hard to restore it,
so now, when I've got that backed up, I worry less...

 > However I was not talking about Bootsafe but rather Tsafe or Vsafe!

Well, BootSafe is also a nuisance. I have long boots, even though mine is one
of them, but not because of SAFEs.

This is what I meant. Sorry. I know it doesn't hook the timer or something,
but it does take longer to execute stuff.

Charles Howes writes on the Subject: Reading the volume serial number
from a disk (PC)

> Does anybody know of a dos call that returns the volume serial number from

 I have used three ways:
        1 - For DOS 4 and up, INT 21 (hex), function 69 (hex)
        2 - Read the boot sector directly
        3 - SHELL a VOL command, with redirection to a file, then
            read and delete the file.

Int 21, function 69 is called with:
(all numbers are HEX)
        AH = 69         ; function
        AL = 00         ; subfunction (GET SERIAL NUMBER)
        BL = drive      ; 0 = default, 1 = A, etc.
        DS:DX = pointer to disk info structure

Disk info structure:
        Offset  Size            Content
        00      WORD            info level (zero)
        02      DWORD           disk serial number in binary
        06      11 bytes        volume label
        11      8 bytes         string "FAT12" or "FAT16"

Since you are using a flavor of BASIC, the third option may be the
only one that is usable.  Ugly, but workable.  I seem to remember that
there is something else to it, though.  "COMMAND /c VOL > foo.foo" ?
something like that.  Sorry I didn't have time to test, but a *PANIC*
has just been declared.

Subject: S.H.R.A.K. (PC)

Hello everybody,

Recently we are observing peculier things here in the Netherlands;

A company called S.H.A.R.K. (Sales department of A.S.S.a.S. ??) is sending
so-called 'viruses' to clients-to-be. The files in question are TPE-GEN.COM
and CRYPGEN.COM.

TPE-GEN.COM is supposed to produce 50 TPE viruses when run. CRYPGEN.COM
should produce 200 MTE viruses.

My analyses showed the files were non-replicating, thus not real live
viruses. They even do not look like TPE or MTE viruses.

None of the current Anti-Virus packages detect all the so-called infected
files 100%, except for TBAV.

With the disk goes a copy out P.C.M. (dutch computer magazine) of a test
of several anti-virus packages. It seems this test was taken to court by
Data Alert (dutch S&S representative) a few months ago.

The court's verdict left the test invalid, as the viruses were considered
not real, according to Alan Solomon who talked about this at one of his
dealer meetings I attended some time ago here in the Netherlands.

What I would like to know from you, the Anti-Virus Community, is whether
you appreciatethis way of promotings one's software.

The files in question will provided to 'certified' researchers at first
request. Please send an email to <Janssen@cpu.nl>.

With regards,

>Are there any viruses known that McAffee can't detect, and if there are
>any, what are the signs?

Even though the question was about McAfee's SCAN, the answer applies to all
other scanners as well.

There are always viruses any given scanner will not detect.  This can be
because the scanner is out of date, the programmers do not have a copy of
the virus, or because they have been unable to come up with a reliable
detection method.

I guess that no scanner ever detects more than 95% of the viruses that are
going around - and some well-known scanners get a lot less.

With well over 2000 viruses now in existence, getting 95% still means that you
will miss over 100 different viruses - usually only very new, rare or difficult
ones.

All scanners miss viruses, which may be detected by other scanners. For example
SCAN 105beta misses Alex.818, Itti.Toxic and Leprosy.Crawler. FindVirus 6.3
misses Cascade 1704.N, Dark_Avenger.1693 and Zherkov.2435.  My own F-PROT 2.08a
misses Abbas, Plagiarist and Sandra. In all cases the missing viruses are
detected by both of the other scanners.

However, the scanners will be updated to detect those now viruses, and all the
examples given above will probably be detected by all the scanners very soon -
but other new viruses will just appear instead.

I'd like to clarify that it's free on Compuserve.  Whatever costs are
the incidental Compuserve costs.  You can also get the updates by

Subject: McAfee VIRUSCAN V106 uploaded to SIMTEL20 and OAK (PC)

I have uploaded to WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL and OAK.Oakland.Edu:

pd1:<msdos.virus>
SCANV106.ZIP    Scans PC's and LAN's for computers viruses
CLEAN106.ZIP    Removes (disinfects) viruses from PC's and LAN's
VSHLD106.ZIP    Memory-resident virus-prevention program (TSR)
WSCAN106.ZIP    Windows 3.x version of SCAN (included)
LANGV106.ZIP    Foreign language modules for SCAN and CLEAN

WHAT'S NEW

     Version 106 of the VIRUSCAN (SCAN, CLEAN, VSHIELD, and WSCAN)
programs have been released.  These replace V105, which was NOT
released on the Internet, but was available from our BBS and other
venues.  This release (V106) adds of 319 viruses since V104, bringing
the total number of known viruses scanned for to 1,453, or counting
variants, 2,146.

VIRUSCAN

     SCAN now detects all known iterations of the Tremor virus.
The /MAINT (scan master boot record and boot sector of a non-DOS
or damaged disk) and /UNATTEND (scan multiuser or multitasking
system) disk have been made default options.  SCAN will check for
these cases and automatically run itself with these options.  The
actual switches have been left in the program so that users will
not have to update their .BAT file or shell programs.

CLEAN-UP

     CLEAN now has removers for the 2878, ExeBug1, ExeBug2, Green
Caterpillar, and Paradise viruses.  CLEAN also recognizes a variant
of the ExeBug1 virus that was sent to us from France.

VSHIELD

     The incompatibility between VSHIELD, SHARE, and Windows is
fixed.  Additionally, the documentation of the /SWAP option, the
/WINDOWS option, and the CHKSHLD option has been improved (which
should help me receive less support calls :-).
     Also, CHKSHLD now tells what options VSHIELD was run with.

FOREIGN LANGUAGE FILES

     Foreign language files are now available in the following
languages:  Bulgarian, Catalan, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French,
Gallego, German (2 files--I'm not sure what the difference is),
Hungarian, Italian, Portugese, Spanish (both European and South
American),  Swedish, and Swiss-German.
     Foreign language support for other languages can be demanded
from your local McAfee Associates agent (agents are, as you may
have guessed, responsible for translations).
     There are no plans for a Latin message file, as Latin is
not commonly used in everyday computing.

OS/2 PROGRAMS

     The OS/2 versions of VIRUSCAN and CLEAN-UP are available by
anonymous ftp from the mcafee.com site (IP# 192.187.128.1) in the
pub/antivirus directory.

Subject: I-M151.ZIP - Integrity Master data integrity/anti-virus sys

I have uploaded to WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL and OAK.Oakland.Edu:

pd1:<msdos.virus>
I-M151.ZIP      Integrity Master data integrity/anti-virus sys

This is version 1.51b of Wolfgang Stiller's Integrity Master program.
I received it on diskette from the author.

Quoting from the author's description:

Integrity Master(tm) is a high performance (100% assembler) program
offering virus protection, data integrity, security and change
management all in one package.  It detects hardware glitches, software
bugs, and even deliberate sabotage to your data.  If a virus strikes,
Integrity Master identifies it by name and also identifies any damage
caused by the virus.  It will also detect new and unknown viruses.

                   Padgett (padgett@tccslr.dnet.mmc.com)
                         standard disclaimers apply

        Once again I have seen the bleating of little minds clamoring for
        virus code. People rising up in the defense of Kim Clancy and the
        "underground" areas of her BBS. Children crying out "Show us your
        Viruses".

        Kim  claimed to be filling the need for "freedom of  information"
        but  wanted  no  responsibility  & was guilty  of  the  two  most
        heinous  sins  one  can commit in  Washington:  "Thou  shalt  not
        surprise  the administration." and "Thou shalt not embarrass  the
        administration."

        It  was inevitable from the time that the Europeans noticed  what
        was   on  the  "Department  of  Public  Debt"   bulletin   board.
        Unrestricted.  Without  any tracing. True, the  same  things  are
        found  on many private BBSes in this country as  elsewhere,  here
        there  are  no laws prohibiting dissemination of virus  code  but
        none the less, IMHO such code can be dangerous.

        Viruses  are an attractive nuisance. *ALL* create damage on  some
        platforms and this is inherently unavoidable. *ALL* take time and
        effort  to remove, usually much more effort than went into  their
        creation.

        Further  *ALL* are easily detected by anyone who looks but  items
        one and two are why I do not release viral code or discuss  virii
        with  anyone I do not personally know to be capable  of  handling
        them properly and "mature" enough to share my views on them.

        In  Florida it is not a crime to possess firearms. It is a  crime
        to  permit  one to fall into the hands of a  juvenile  if  injury
        ensues unless "due care" can be proven. It is my right to  decide
        to use what I consider "due care" with viral code.

        I  also  believe  that what makes a virus  a  virus  is  trivial.
        Replication  is easy and only takes a few bytes of code  (usually
        viral authors even skimp on this and damage ensues).

        In  the last year I have only seen two  "interesting"  techniques
        show  up  in viruses and they did not have to be  viruses  to  be
        interesting. One was the CMOS manipulation used by the EXEBUG and
        represents a technique that might well be able to be used on some
        AT class machines to avoid accidental cold-boots from floppy.

        Neither involves mutating engines nor is such an engine likely to
        be any more advanced than that shown  by Mark Washburn's V-series
        (also  easy to detect but can be very difficult to remove  -  see
        item number two again).

        In  each  case I have experienced, people asking for  virus  code
        have  shown not the least level of expertise that would  indicate
        that  they are capable of understanding what the code does. I  am
        often  reminded  of  Picasso's  requirement  that  a  prospective
        student  paint  a  perfectly realistic  flower  before  he  would
        consider  teaching  his  style. One must master  the  art  before
        creating it.

        The  difficult  part about writing code at the BIOS level  is  in
        knowing  what  cannot  be done: you  must  first  understand  the
        envelope before you can exist within it.

        For  instance,  several others and myself have for years  used  a
        CMOS  manipulation  to "hide" the hard disk  while  experimenting
        with viruses or to safeguard a setup during demonstration. I have
        "skeleton" code that does this for me that works on most machines
        but would be disastrous to use on a PS/2. Its what you don't  see
        that gets you (IWYDSTGY).

        As another example, the writer of the Michelangelo had  evidently
        never  heard of 3 1/2" floppy disks and "assumed" (you know  what
        that  means)  that  anything not a 360k must be  a  1.2  Mb  with
        predictable  results. Meanwhile students of the  literature  knew
        several years earlier how to handle these. At least the  original
        STONED  author  included validation code that  would  not  infect
        anything other than a 360k - he was not aware of the early  FDISK
        format however & did not consider the possibility of UNIX on a PC
        so the resulting "awsh*t" takes away the "attaboy".

        Or  consider the BRAIN, the first "stealth" virus. "Stealth"  not
        because  it was trying to hide, but "Stealth" because  the  disks
        would be unbootable otherwise.

        Repeatedly  people  have  asked me about viral  source  code  and
        turned away churlishly when I suggest that they read the works of
        Ray  Duncan,  Leo Scanlon, Ralf Brown, Terry Dettmann,  and  Neil
        Colvin first.

        I do not take students but should this change, I would say "First
        write  a perfect MBR with the minimum number of  bytes  necessary
        for  use  with MS/PC-DOS 2.0-6.0 and useful with  both  8088  and
        Pentium CPUs. Explain."

                                                Warmly,

                                                     Padgett

        ps  You  do not drive my Judge before *I* know you can  handle  a
            400+ HP four-speed either.

Subject: Scanners (CVP)

PRTAVSE.CVP   930625

                             Scanners

Scanning software is, paradoxically, the least protective and
historically most useful of anti-viral software.  These programs
examine files, boot sectors and/or memory for evidence of viral
infection.  They generally look for viral "signatures", sections of
program code that are known to be in specific viri but not in most
other programs.  Because of this, scanning software will generally
only detect "known" viri, and must be updated regularly.  Some
scanning software has "resident" versions that check each file as it
is run, but most require that you run the software "manually".  It
is also the classic case of "bolting the door after the horse is
gone" since "scanners" only find infections after they occur.

Why then, with all the disadvantages of scanning software, are they
the most successful of anti-viral packages?  Generally speaking, it
is because they force the user to pay attention to the system.
Again, when a user relies on one particular method of protection
they are most vulnerable.

I have stated that scanners can only find infections after they
occur, but that does not mean that scanners cannot play a
preventative role in protecting the system.  If scanning software is
used consistently to check each disk or file that "enters" a system
(and kept up to date), the chance of a viral infection being allowed
to enter is greatly reduced.  Unfortunately, the use of scanners
tends to be less than effective in many cases.  My own experience
tends to suggest that the most widely used scanning software,
generally updated every month or two, tends to be an average of
eleven months out of date on most user systems.  In one case I was
assured that a computer was protected because the vendor had
installed antiviral software.  On examination, this turned out to be
a "manually" invoked scanner, long out of date, in an archived (and
therefore non-executable) file, with no provision for either
automated invocation or instructions for the users.

A recent addition to scanners is intelligent analysis of unknown
code, currently referred to as "heuristic" scanning.  More closely
akin to activity monitoring functions than traditional signature
scanning (and previously examined in that section), this looks for
"suspicious" sections of code that are generally found in viral
programs.  While it is possible for normal programs to want to "go
resident", look for other program files, or modify their own code,
these are tell-tale signs that would help an informed user to come
to some decision about the advisability of running or installing a
given "new and unknown" program.  "Heuristics", however, may
generate a lot of false alarms, and may either scare novice users,
or give them a false sense of security after "wolf" has been cried
too often.
