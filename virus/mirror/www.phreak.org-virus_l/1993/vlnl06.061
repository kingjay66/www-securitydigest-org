I wish it was so. If it was, then they wouldn't need an Anti Virus in the 
first place, and the PC's/Networks etc' would work fine.

But take notice that *people* use these PCs, and wherevere people are
envolved anything could happened.  Someone can get a floppy from home
and run it on the network, or you can buy a *NEW* "clean" software
package to be used at work only (but the company that sold it to you
also has employees that jurk-around with thair PC at work), so
eventually, a virus can find its way in your PC by many ways, and you
cannot assume anything for a fact (unfortunately).

Just to remind you of the magazine in France that gave away
thousends of copies of infected floppies (FRODO virus), or several *major* 
companies in Israel that *SOLD* infected software....

That is true, if the scanner is designed properly the number of viruses will 
have small affect on the speed: Suppose your method of chacking a file for 
virus presence in based on an algorithm which generates the pointer to the 
data concerning the virus in your scanner, so there is always but *ONE* 
process per tested-file running and a second cpecific process for verification.
. whatever the number of viruses known at that time.

As for memory requirements, programs are converted more and
more into DPMI programs, so in Protected Mode the memory
problem is smaller...
Besides: most programs are becoming GENBERIC programs, thus minimizing the 
need of huge database for more and more viruses.

Both e-mail and regular mail. When regular mail is used, it is, of
course, not limited to the US Post Office only - you know, the US Post
Office is not that much popular here in Germany... :-)

You are right.

On FidoNet the situation is slightly different. If NetMail is used,
then you are calling directly the telephone of the recipient, so the
only way to intercept the virus code is by wiretaping. On the other
side, some idiots like to broadcast viruses to the echo conferences -
since it is not possible to moderate them, there is no way this can be
prevented...

Uh, that's a tough question... For instance, according to some people,
I am an automatic e-mail daemon; according to others (see the April
1st issue), I am a virus... :-) Indeed, several people have met me
personally, but it has probably been a spoof... :-))

[Moderator's note: I have met Vesselin and I can attest to the fact
that he is most definitely, beyond any doubt whatsoever, a virus.  ;-)]

Indeed, we are usually using encryption when sending viruses to other
researchers. In general, PKZIP with at least 8-character password
selected from the full ASCII set is secure enough against hackers. For
additional security, one may use DES or PGP. PGP uses public key
cryptography, which eliminates the key management problem, but there
seem to be some legal obstacles (patents) against its usage in the
USA.

I would like to use this opportunity to ask everybody to use some kind
of encryption when sending us viruses. If you cannot use PGP, use
PKZIP with a long password and send the password by a different
channel, for instance by fax. My phone and fax numbers can be found in
my .signature.

Subject: Ides of march Virus Conference

I have sent the following message to dklefkon@well.sf.ca.us 
(Richard W. Lefkon).  I would advise everyone who has spoken at 
previous conferences, and who does not wish to be associated with 
advertising for any future conference, to consider giving similar 
instructions as to the use of their names/photos.


Dear Dick,

I have attended three of your conferences.  The organisation at 
the first two was merely disastrous, but the chaos at this years 
conference was totally inexcusable.  I prepared a paper, which 
was submitted in good time, and I was assured that it had been 
accepted, and that I had been allocated a favorable time at which 
to present it.

However when we arrived in New York I found that there was no 
program, and that no one knew what was supposed to be happening.  
Furthermore there were no Proceedings, so that it was impossible 
even to decide who to talk to, let alone which talks we should 
try to attend (IF we could determine when, where  - or if - they 
were being presented).

I was extremely disappointed to discover that, despite your 
promises, you had apparently not scheduled me to give the 
paper which you had assured me had been accepted by the 
committee.  I regard this as a gross breach of faith on your 
part, and I suspect that you have deliberately taken advantage of 
me, so that you could use my name to publicise your conference.  

At the time you kept promising us that the Proceedings would 
arrive "tomorrow", and then that they would be posted to us 
"immediately".  I am exceedingly disgusted to discover that still 
no-one has received them.  I would point out that you have a 
legal obligation to deliver the Proceedings, which were 
advertised as an integral part of the Conference.  WHEN WILL WE 
GET THEM?

So it seems that we have gone to considerable trouble to prepare 
a paper which was not presented, or - apparently - even 
published.  It cost us over $US6500 to send two delegates to this 
conference, and in the circumstances we can only regard this as 
having been largely wasted.  

I believe that the disaster this year was of such epic proportions 
that no-one would attend any conference scheduled for this time 
and date, even if you had no part in the organisation.  However 
as you still seem to think that you can do better next time I 
wish to advise you that you may not, IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, make 
any use of my name or photograph in any advertising relating to 
any future conference.  If you should disregard this instruction 
I will instruct my legal advisers to take appropriate action.

This mailing network is *NOT* a comercial network. It should not supply such 
straight forward information, however you may learn your answer from talks 
about the product in VIRUS_L.
What I do not understand is: since you are close to the dish, whay can't you 
obtain the information form clos-by sources, your country is a multi Anti-
Viral nation?

Subject: Abe Lincoln Virus? (PC)

A week or so ago, one of the PC's in our office began
acting strangely in Windows 3.1 - the effects were that
any process that went out into DOS would die.

We scanned the PC with Norton AntiVirus (latest version)
which turned up nothing.  Soon after that, the PC (from
Windows) cleared the screen and drew a detailed picture
of Abe Lincoln.

Finally after much digging into the system, we noticed that
the COMMAND.COM file in the C:\DOS directory was larger
than the one in the root directory, and that the only place
where the one in the DOS directory was being referenced was
in some of the Windows .INI files, etc.  We replaced the
COMMAND.COM and now our system works fine.

Has anyone experienced such an occurrence?  I would like to
know more about this "virus".

Thanks,

We have had two calls yesterday from someone in England and someone in

From:    padgett@tccslr.dnet.mmc.com (A. Padgett Peterson)
Subject: ANSI viruses and things that go bump in the night (mostly PC)

a) If you have the stock ANSI.SYS loaded, have demonstrated that it
   is possible to construct a mechanism that will cause an infection
   to occur on execution of a DIR command on a "prepared" floppy.

b) There is no real need for anyone to have ANSI.SYS loaded.

IMHO while ANSI.SYS once had a real value for key redirection, this
is no longer true. Today the main reason is to set the screen colors
(a PROMPT string containing <esc>[37;44m will produce a blue background 
with white letters). You can do the same thing with a one byte change 
to COMMAND.COM (DOS 5.0 and 6.0 COMMAND.COM contain on byte pair "B7 07". 
The second byte defines the screen colors on a CLS (07 is low white on 
black). Using DEBUG you can change this byte (found at DEBUG offset 4A53
in DOS 6.0) to 17 for a blue background or 0F for bright white on black 
- - nice on older laptops - Note: you will need to reboot after the change
& COMSPEC must point to the new COMMAND.COM.

If you *must* have key redirection via ANSI.SYS then the fix is another
simple change using DEBUG - for 6.0 the byte at DEBUG offset 161 is a 
hex 70 (lower case "p"). Change this to a character unused by ANSI (no
hints here, diversity is strength 8*) and you ansi will not recognize
a "stock" ANSI redirection command (e.g. <esc>[<key>;<string>p). Unless
the malefactor can guess your new character, ANSI bombs will not work.

Greetings
	I was wondering if anybody could tell me if it is possible for a  
scanner to detect a virus in a compressed file or on a stacked hard drive  
or if the virus can be detected on a file that has been backed up using

If it can be detected could you tell me the name of the software that can  
do it

Subject: Windows 3.1 virus (PC)

I keep seeing people who report "general protection faults" and
similar things and attribute them to virus action.  I'm having similar
problems with the same error mesages; Microsoft insists this almost
certainly is a wonky SIMM, not any sort of virus.  They back it up
with technical manual pages by fax.

Today, someone reported actually cleaning up a 36 byte virus.  I,have
real trouble believing this; the smallest I know of is 44 bytes and
isn't viable, much a Windows specific infector.

Do you know of anyone with real data on this?  (Bontchev or Skulason,
perhaps?)

All diagnostivc tactics I have available indicate no virus.  This
includes checksums on some critical programs, scan 107, (oops, 102 I
think), fprot 207, limited file examination (I can't read 36 bytes of
hex somewhere in some Windows kernel of several hundred K!)  Yes, I
booted from a known-clean diskette that doesn't load anything from the
hard disk.
 
Once the school term ends and I can do without my rather crippled
computer for a few days, I'll know for sure if there's a hardware
problem.  I"ll let ya know -- bu this won't necessarily rule out a
Windows-specific virus in other systems.

Any pointers?

I have had similar problems with my system running drdos 6.0 with the
windows upgrade.  I have noticed mostly when I exit windows.
Rebooting seems to remedy the problem.  I have used F-prot and McAfee
and found no virus.  I have also run AVS and the files remain clean.

On a coupon in the back of the MS-DOS 6.0 Upgrade Manual where you are told
to send in your money for all of the optional extras (like EDLIN & EXE2BIN)
for MSAV updates it says "...the first will ship now..."

On page 277 of the same booklet you are advised to call a BBS (seems to 
be at Central Point) at (503)531-8100. Quoting from the book again "As
viruses are discovered, their signatures are posted on a bulletin board 
system (BBS), which is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week."

Called the number on Saturday. No answer. Called tonight (Tuesday) got
answer (@14,400 8*). Went through login procedure. No signatures. Not
even a *place* for signatures that I could find. No place to leave comments. 
(Did open with presumably voice telephone numbers). Since I did not want to 
read a text file on the Michelangelo, I signed off. Wake me if the 
signatures appear.

I think I was the first Westerner to get a sample of this virus.
It came from Thailand in May of 1991, and the person I got it
from said that the tune it sometimes plays is a Thai tune
called "Lao Doung Duen".  Hence the name (and the spelling).

Subject: Identifying a virus: help needed (PC)

Hello,
I have been contacted by a company whose computers are probably hit by a 
virus. The guy I spoke to is not a DOS expert, so I have only very little 
information. 

The "virus" is NOT detected or identified by "recent" versions of:
Norton AV (2.1), Dr. Solomon, Elia shim virusafe and Central Point AV.

Operating system: DrDOS 5 and MSDOS 5
Symptoms: 
- - the virus creates several new files until the hard disk is full. 
  the names of the new files are: 
    AIAMBEAN
    AMCBAODC,ALDHABEF,ALCHOCK,APPLOAD.DFS    size      0
    ALCHCOCK.SWR,ALDHABEF.SWR,AMCBAODC.SWR   size 100000
- - many lost clusters
- - after starting up from a floppy, the CMOS is overwritten and DOS is 
  not available 

Any help or comments is welcome. Please reply by email to 
bart.preneel@esat.kuleuven.ac.be

Another university here in Utah is reporting an outbreak of a virus called 
Brazil or Brazilian.

Is there such a beast?

I haven't seen it here nor have I heard of it on our campus.  The reports 
also say that F-PROT doesn't find it, but they do refer to something called 
antibras.

Any help is appreciated.  Thanks.

Interesting. If you didn't detect it with any virus scanner, how do you
know it was a virus?

|MkSVir (available at FUNET with on-line translator). This virus caused
|General Protection Fault in Windows 3.1 in krnl386.exe when running Write,
|Paintbrush, MS Word 2.0 and System Editor. It was probably very small. I
|think it took 32 bytes of base memory (difference between memory with and
|without virus). 

32 bytes isn't enough to write an interrupt service routine, much less
anything resembling a virus.

|                I throw it out by formatting HD and setting up system
|again.

This was probably unnecessary.

|       My question is: has anyone heard/seen anything about this virus?

It doesn't sound like a virus; it sounds like one of your Windows files
got corrupted. Most likely, all you had to do was reinstall Windows.

|                                                                        Is
|there any signature? 

It would take a captured copy to extract a signature from, and since you
formatted your drive, you destroyed any possibility of finding out what
happened. 

Don't assume that every problem that pops up on a computer is a virus.
There are many other possible causes, which is what you should have looked
for after not finding anything with the scanners.

|                     Which programs in Internet might be infected?

Probably a very small number. Certainly none with a 32-byte virus.

Ummm,

a friend of mine has had his HD infected by what appears to be Tequila.

He's tried every single anti-virus program he can lay hands on, but it
 keeps re-appearing, for no apparent reason. Its not from a floppy or
 anything as he has had it re-appear BEFORE even using the floppy drive
 after disinfection.

My only suggestion is that Stacker 2.0 (which he has installed on the
 infected drive) may be quirky.....can anyone suggest anything?

Thanx in advance....

I had the exact same thing happen to me, except that it was F-proot
that noticed the Flip virus signiture , and it was in Vwatch(.com oor
.sys? I can't remember). Since CPAV was about 18 months out of date
(and just taking up hard disk space) I deleted the whole program. But
yeah, I think it does have that sig. somewhere in it. I never had any
problems with viruses (knock on woood) other than finding flip, and
only in that one file.

bye.

Subject: Terminator 2 and Bert virus ?? (PC)

Hello there,

Can anyone help me with the following problem !!??

Yesterday morning I found my system infected with two virusses.  Scan
v100 found only one, and scan v102 detected a file with two.  I found
the origin of the viruses, namely a file called passrem.exe, which I
downloaded from a BBS.

The viruses were called the Terminator 2 virus (stealth), and the Bert
virus.  The latter was only found by vers. 102.  Alas there is no
description of those viruses in the virlist.txt, and vsum x303 doesn't
answer completely too (only some info on the terminator, terminator
2001 (or something like that) and the terminator 3002 (or something
like that)).

Does anyone know these viruses. (scan gives [Term2] and [Bert] )

Second of all, is there a way to check zip files before extracting
them on viruses ??.

Thank you very much  !!!!!!

Vincent Houkes

PS.

f-prot 207  cannot locate the viruses, not even in a heuristic scan. !!

Subject: Help wanted with Dir-II virus (PC)

Hi everyone,

I recently discoverd the Dir-II virus on my system (486/33 with a
212 Mb Hd). I've a bootable flop  which contains no virus and
includes a virusscanner, scan v102 from Mcafee. I scanned the HD but
scan didn't detect any virus. So I assumed that the HD was clean.
I have read in the virlist.txt that the dir-II virus uses stealth 
techniques and selfencryption . Maybe this is the reason that the
virus can't be detected. 

Actually I have the following problem. Because the virlist.txt
describes that the dir-II virus crosslink files and directories I used
chkdsk and norton diskdoktor to correct the problem. There are crosslinked
files and directories. Norton disktor (ndd) repairs the files.
After using NDD I use chkdsk and the unallocated chained are nicely
converted to files. I delete those files. But when I run NDD again
I get the same errors and even some more. So I think that my system 
is still infected. 

Can anyone help me with this problem. Because I have optimized the
programs to communicate with eachother I don`t like formating the 
disk again.  

So any comments about the dir-II virus are welcome.

Thanks in advance

Raymond

Subject: Censoship/40-Hex (PC)

Vesselin says:
> Burger's and Ludwig's books are crap

After wasting my time on a couple of bogus virus books ("dangerous",
because they contained <gasp> *actual viral source code*), I dusted off
my assembly books, and am looking for some good disassemblers so I
can get decent information on the two virii that I have encountered
here in the "wild".  It seems that in the current climate of viral
censorship, the only way to get decent info is to

a) Go to the "underground" (not always good information, but at least
   they aren't afraid to share it...)
   
b) DIY (Which I'm currently in the process of doing.  It costs me spare time,
   but I (slowly) gain knowldege and I know that the only person BS'ing
   me is me.
     
I've yet to read a decent virus book.  Can you recommend a solid,
relevant virus book?

Vesselin says:

And how does a "good guy" get 40-Hex?  Wouldn't receipt of 40-Hex from
*any* source be participation in the -distribution- of this magazine?
Not necessarily by dissemenating the info ("good guys" would NEVER do
that), but by creating demand.  Even if you get it from another "good guy",
passing the magazine from one place or person to another is distribution.
This is something that is ok for YOU to participate in, but not ME (if I am
to be a "good guy")???

Tell me, where do YOU get 40-Hex from?

Why should it be ok for you to receive it, but not me?

I do not wish to detract from the extremely valuable and "good" work that
you do as a virus researcher, just want to point out that "good"/"bad"
is not black/white, more like shades of gray.  Case in point - your
participation in 40-Hex distribution.  If you're going to fight the "bad"
guys, you've got to get your hands dirty.

BOTTOM LINE:  I really get peeved when access to information such as
	      40-Hex is limited "for my own good".  In the short term,
	      censorship may seem like a good idea, but in the long term,
	      it just limits information to the  (good/bad/ugly)
	      and leaves all of us neutral/gray people at the mercy of
	      self-appointed "experts" (good/bad).

	      I trust any expert as far as I can independantly verify what
	      they say.
