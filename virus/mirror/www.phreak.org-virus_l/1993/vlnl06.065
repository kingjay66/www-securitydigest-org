This is not strictly true.  Fidonet also has an email routing method called
"host routing" in which email is transferred through one (or more?) "host"
systems.  There is a "host" for each "net" and one of the obligations of
a host is to pass host-routed mail, although most of them will complain if
you do so, since there is generally no good reason other than forcing 
someone else to shoulder the long-distance phone bill for the message.

Additionally, email sent to other Fidonet-compatible networks or other
zones (Europe and North America are in different zones) may wait in a 
gateway.  Email in Fidonet is not always point-to-point, and encryption of 
sensitive data, such as new viruses, with a good encryption program is always
a good idea.

No, this is exactly what Frisk is trying to tell you - it is possible
to make the scanning time constant (and very short), regardless (well,
almost) of how many signatures you are scanning for. At the expense of
memory usage, of course. The technique is known as "hashing" and is
explained in Kunth's "bible". Roger Riordan has invented another such
technique, called Polysearch; it is described in the proceedings of
the 5th International Computer Virus and Security Conference.

Honest, have you recently run CPAV or NAV or SCAN or F-Prot on a XT with 
CGA, 256 Kb conventional RAM, no XMS or EMS RAM, and a 20 Mb MFM hard disk?
Did the scanner fit into that memory? Did you have the patience to
wait until it finishes the memory scan? Would you run it on that
machine every day? (Note: some of the scanners mentioned will probably
run under these conditions. Whether the user will be willing to use
them is another question.)

That's very true, but nevertheless there are hundreds of -silly-
viruses being written even nowadays, so a generic disinfector really
helps - just don't expect it to be able to handle everything.

A generic disinfector is significantly easier to write than a generic
scanner. With a generic scanner you have to worry about the false
positives. To make a generic disinfector you just need to keep some
information about the uninfected files and try to restore it after
infection. The more information you keep, the better the chances that
you'll succeed to recover the file. In order to achieve 100%
effectiveness, it is sufficient to keep ALL the information about the
files.

Such 100% effective generic disinfector exists. It is supplied with
every DOS version. It is called BACKUP (or something similar). Use it.
It can disinfect any virus, and not only viruses... :-)

A generic method for Necropolis? It's relatively difficult for generic
disinfectors... Not completely impossible, but... Oh, I see, you
probably mean the trick with archiving all executables, booting from a
clean system and restoring them? Works for almost any stealth fast
infector; I have described that years ago when I first saw Frodo...
And have actually used it to remove Number of the Beast, Necropolis,
Dir II (for the last one I used a simpler variation).

Bzzt... Won't work. Here comes CPAV/TNTVIRUS in its "immunize" mode,
adding "MsDos" to all files, or SCAN /AV, adding 10 bytes to all
files, or the file has been downloaded with Xmodem and is padded with
1Ah to the next multiple of 128. Now the 170h word from the end of the
file contains something entire different and you miss the virus, which
works perfectly and infects the user's system. Or am I missing
something? Relying on the supposition that the virus will be at a
particular offset from the beginning or from the end of the file could
be very dangerous. You should either follow the file entry point, or
scan the whole file...

Uh, -what- generic methods in McAfee's package? The generic boot

file virus detection - the Fam[1-3EJMNQ-S] viruses? That's horribly 
bad. Or the generic boot sector virus disinfector? That's useful, but 
trivial to bypass...

That sounds nice in theory, but there are a few practical problems to
implement it. You are probably referring to something like the method
used by TbClean - interpret the virus until it restores the original
file. Problem is, how do you know that the virus has transferred
control to the original file? What if the virus performs (randomly)
something destructive before transferring control to the original file?
What if the virus tries to detect that it has been
interpreted/traced/emulated and behaves differently in these cases?
What are you going to do - emulate the full hardware? Let the virus do
the damage?

I don't think that anybody complained about the lack of chairs in the
last conference. The major complain was about the lack of
organization... Because of that the chairs didn't know what to chair,
where, when, and who was speaking in their sessions and what about.

(BTW, I thought that "chair" means only the object you use to sit on;
you seem to be using it as a synonym for "chairperson"?)

I'm afraid that this alone might repulse the prospective attendees for

Huh? Dick is probably a nice chap (well those two who were thrown 
away by the security guards, reportedly on his order, might disagree), 
but one thing I have been unable to observe him during the last two 
years was organizing conferences...

Due to which in 1992 the speakers had about 10-20 minutes to speak.
I'm not sure about how much time they had this year, due to the fact
that nobody knew who is speaking, where, when, for how long, and about
what.

Speaking about proceedings, may I remind you that none of us has

Meeting many specialists and swapping anecdotes is nice, but many of us
go there to present a speech, listen to other speeches, and get the
proceedings. This year I learned when my speech is literally hours
before I had to present it, didn't know where to present it till the
end, and it was announced as something completely different. I
couldn't meet many of the attendees I wanted to meet, because I
couldn't find out where and when they are speaking, or even whether
they were present at all...

I won't discuss in details such things about the last conference like
the lack of enough food or even place at the gala dinner, the horrible
hotel (sheesh, we have better ones even in Bulgaria), etc... Actually
it was my intention not to comment it at all, because I feel indebted
to the organizer - he agreed to wave my conference fee and even payed
three days of my staying in the hotel. But after your message, I just
couldn't resist...

You must be joking.

If his "contributions" this year, the last, and the one before that are
"excellent", I must have a very different understanding of what that word
means than you do.

Oh, we do ?  Strange, I had not noticed that :-) This year the proceedings
were not distributed at all, and I have not yet - a month later - not received
my copy.

I would change "is" to "was" above.  I went to the conference not because
of the papers presented, but simply to meet other "experts".  However,
the conference has become an embarrassment to several of us.  As I have said
before, I apologize to anyone who attended this year's confererence...this is
not what a anti-virus/security conference is supposed to be like.  I will
not be supporting or attending this conference next year - this has already
been too much waste of time and money for too many people.  Instead I will
be doing my best to support two other conferences in USA in '94 - one in the
spring, which is organized by VSI, and the other (the VB conference) in the
fall.

I would also like to state, as others have done, that I do not want to have
my picture on any future brochures.

Ahem. This is SURELY not what I had in mind when I compiled that article.

That article is a result of the crackings I did in the past. I collected all 
the fairly useful tricks I've came across, and published them. I only crack to 
learn, and teach others. I have already advised at least one how to alter his 
protection scheme to make it tougher.

I consider myself on both sides. True, I do some cracking, occasionally. I am 
not ashamed of it, because most of my Assembly knowledge, which people tend to 
appreciate more than myself, has come from there. And, as you saw, I routed 
this experience/knowledge to useful routs.

Each delegate to the recent conference paid a registration fee 
ranging from $325 to $425.  If we add a conservative $200 for 
accomodation and travel, and $400 for two days pay, and we assume 
that there were 500 paying delegates (in the absense of any 
reliable information on the subject), and add the costs of the 
exhibitors, and overseas delegates, the total cost of this 
conference was almost certainly well in excess of $500,000.

If any individual had paid this amount for a service which failed 
as dismally as did this conference, they would certainly take 
legal action.  Unfortunately it would be difficult to establish 
just how much loss the delegates had suffered, and difficult for 
any individual to take action.  However the registration form 
clearly stated "Registration includes Proceedings, ... ".  As 
these are valued (by the organisers) at $100 per copy, the 
organisers are in clear breach of contract to the tune of 
something like $50,000.

I have been promised that I would receive the proceedings in a 
couple of weeks, but as we were promised we would receive 
them "Tomorrow", then "they will be posted first thing next 
week", I place no credence in this.

Despite all this Ms Brand appears to think that the organisers 
can make a few cosmetic changes and continue as before.  Is  
there anyone, or any organisation, who/which is in a position 
to ensure firstly that the organisers meet their legal obligations 
with respect to the Proceedings, and secondly that they are not 
permitted to attempt to repeat this fiasco?

My question is: why do you need a virus (or worm) to do this ? All
you need is a regular program that runs as part of the login script,
detects the version via strobe/date/size/checksum and performs a copy/
execute if an update is needed. McAfee's CHKSHLD in a .BAT will do this 
function plus verify that the TSR is functioning properly and is neither 
virus nor worm (neither the .BAT nor CHKSHLD needs to be copied to the 
client).

Well, there was a lengthy post on the latest virus for the Mac.  The  
reason I think there aren't any postings for the Mac is because Mac users  
have more respect for their environment, and less viruses are written.  If  
there aren't any new viruses to talk about, and the old ones are taken  
care of by the detection programs out there, then there is nothing to  
discuss.  I think, though, if a Mac posting is made, the subject should be  
easily identifiable as a Mac posting and it should stand out, because  
there are so few of them.

Virus writers will write viruses, Ant-Virus writers will write
anti-virus programs, I think it should be publicised, only
to inform the (uninformed) public about how easy it actually
is, you wouldn't belive the amount of people who "trust".
I had one friend who was a new computer user, had 2 different
viruses on his system and didn't even know it!

There are also another extreme group of people, paranoid about
security, who cringe at even hearing the word virus, and all the

viruses were made to be public domain then

a.) trusting people will see what they really are up against
b.) paranoid people will see how trivial most viruses are.

heck, who can't make a batch program that goes

Also, people, in general, will know how to effectively combat a virus

When I say 'countries' it is implies 'government'... ie, Do You believe

Speaking about ANSI drivers, does anybody know one which:

1) Is public domain or freeware or shareware (I'm not interested in
commercial implementations);

2) Runs on anything, including CGA (I'm not interested in
implementations that require at least EGA);

3) Supports everything that the DOS ANSI.SYS does (I'm not interested
in restricted versions);

4) Can be loaded both as a device driver and as a TSR;

5) Allows the user to optionally disable keyboard programming with an
option from the command line (I'm not interested in implementations
that don't allow keyboard programming at all or that have to be
re-compiled in order to change their behavior);

6) Comes in source.

?

As far as I know (haven't seen the latest versions), none of the
drivers mentioned by you satisfies all of the above conditions... Does
anybody know a driver that does satisfy them?

If the user is computer literate, s/he probably would have organized
his/her disk in such a way that the directories listed in the PATH
variable appear first in the directory tree, so your method will work
reasonably well. However, for the casual user whose directory tree is
more likely to be a complete mess, it is possible to devise an
improvement of your method. How about the following:

1) Check the command interpreter;

2) Check the first few files in the root directory;

3) Check the first few files in the current directory;

4) Check a few files (randomly selected) in each directory listed in
the PATH variable;

5) Check the first few files in the first subdirectory of the root 
directory;

6) Check the first few files in the first deepest subdirectory (i.e., 
your current approach).

I think that 10 is a reasonable number for "a few". This procedure is
a bit more complex to implement than the one you are currently using,
but will run just as fast and will increase the chance to catch the
virus.

Yes, they are using the "Dark Avenger" method, or the method the boot
sector viruses are using. But sooner or later the virus writers will
switch to more sophisticated schemes... With the lack of memory
protection in DOS, there are plenty of holes for an unknown virus to
hide... Hiding a known virus is significantly more difficult, but
several tricks are possible too...

Wait, wait, wait, there are too many wrong things in the above...
First, as far as I know, Search and Destroy is the scanner/disinfector
part of Untouchable only. The strongest part of the product is its
integrity checker - that is what you must install and use.

Next, what is this "little something from the Mte that proved to be
very spreadable"? I've never heard about any MtE-based virus being
found in the wild - is your university the first case?

Next, the integrity checker from Untouchable is able to repair almost
any possible boot sector infector and certainly Stoned and Form. Are
you sure to have installed and used it in the correct way?

Next, what's so nasty about Form? A silly boot sector infector that
makes your keyboard click on a particular date...

Next, what exactly means "the Untouchable software failed miserably"?
Which part of the software? Have you installed the integrity checker
on a virus-free system? If not - why not? Maybe you have used only the
scanner/disinfector?

Next, what corrupted files? Stoned and Form are boot sector viruses;
they don't infect files...

This is NOT a VIRUS. Please. I never wrote one, now will I.

That was an experimental code. Since I only have an AT-Type (IDE) drives, I 
only know AT THE MOMENT, how to access IDE drives via ports. However, I have 
the ANSI specifications of SCSI too (as well as SCSI-2), so given such a 
harddisk, I believe I could write the equivalent code in less than two hours.

I don't think so.

When I thought about this technique, my fear was NOT for viruses to use it to 
MULTIPLY, because you can scan for them anyway. My fear was that viruses will 
implement such a technique to CAUSE MALICIUS HARM. And believe me, there's a 
lot of harm you can do with ports, that you can't do with INT 13h...

Subject: VSAFE WONDER false alarm? (PC)

I've had a number of incidents lately on our 255 PC Novell LAN where
VSAFE reports an executable is infected with the WONDER virus.

F-PROT 2.07, CPAV's SCAN function (1.4), and McAfee's SCANV102 and NETSCAN102
don't find anything, so I'm assuming it is a false alarm.   No suspicious
activity has been detected when the suspect executables are run in the
absence of VSAFE.   I'm using a home-grown CRC checking system which detects
any modifications to key executables and is run whenever any PC boots... this
hasn't detected any modifications to executables as would likely happen if
there really was a WONDER infection.

One of the suspect files is ECODE.EXE, part of a commercial hypertext
system which displays the Canadian Electrical Code.

Has anyone run into similar problems with VSAFE (version 1.4 from
Central Point)?

Boot from a clean diskette and do a SYS C:. This will remove the virus
from the hard disk. It will also leave one cluster, marked as bad by
the virus, but this is not something to worry about. If you are a
perfectionist and know what you are doing, you might use Norton
Utilities to mark the cluster back as unused.

Note: the above advice assumes that even if you are not familiar with
viruses, you are at least familiar with DOS and your PC. If you don't
know what "boot from a clean diskette" means - ask me by private
e-mail. It also assumes that you are smart enough to boot from the
same DOS version as the one installed on your hard disk. And it
finally assumes that if SYS tells you "No room for system files" you
know how to fix the problem with Norton Disk Doctor and its "Make a
disk bootable" capability. If not - ask me by private e-mail.

Well, VSUM has been converted to this new format since quite a while -
I think since version 9212. One thing that I do not understand is why
the new hypertext engine (produced by the same company) is no longer
able to view the old .H! files... Another puzzling thing is why
Patricia Hoffman has disabled the Cut&Paste function - this makes even
less likely that people export information from there, correct it, and
send her back the corrections...

"Flawed in the same way" is an insult for Ralf Brown's work. I am
using his list intensively and have found only a few minor mistakes
and omissions. In the same time, each time I consult a VSUM entry, I
find it either incomplete, or containing errors, or both. Not to
mention how unnecessary verbose the articles there are...

The copy on Simtel20 is compressed with the new PKZIP and is a bit

Two of them are available for anonymous ftp from our site:

ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de:/pub/virus/progs/vbaseabc.zip
ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de:/pub/virus/texts/catalog/cvb-293.zip

The first one is in the same format as VSUM, so you can use the same
hypertext engine (VSUM.EXE) to browse it. Neither of the two is
complete enough (actually, both are ridiculously incomplete), but any
of them is significantly more accurate than VSUM.
