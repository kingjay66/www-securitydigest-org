Subject: Integrity Checking for Anti-Viral Purposes [and MSAV paper]

  Two years ago I presented a paper (at the first Virus Bulletin
Conference) on checksumming techniques for anti-viral purposes, which
Vesselin has mentioned in this forum several times.  I intended to
make it available to anyone who's interested ... but only after I got
through revising it.  Well, it's now ready (33 pages long).

  To a large extent it's a tutorial ("everything you always wanted to
know about integrity checking but were afraid to ask"), but it also
defends a certain controversial position (CRC is as secure as a cryp-
tographic algorithm for anti-viral purposes if certain conditions are
satisfied).  The article is also a bit unusual in that some sections
are on a very practical level while others are theoretical.

  Mainly because of the mathematical symbols in some of the sections,
the article is not available as an ordinary text file.  In fact, it's
available only in PostScript form or as a uuencoded DVI file.  Let me
know which you prefer and I'll e-mail it to you.  (If you have absolu-
tely no way of printing such files, I could send a very abbreviated
version (containing about 1/4 of the content) as an ordinary text
file, but you'll be missing a lot.)

I'm looking either to find/purchase a calender of viruses attack dates
(ie: when to watch out for them more so than normal) or to create one.
So if anyone knows of either an existing calendar or the dates a virus
will attack to go on a calender would you please email me.  Thank you

Subject: Info needed about gulf war virus - help!

I'm doing a presentation on computer viruses this thursday (07/15/93)
and would like to include some information about a supposed computer
virus inserted into the Iraqi computer systems by the coalition
forces, or the U.S.  This virus (I've heard) blanked out iraqi
computer screens (like a screen blanker) making it impossible to see
information printed thereon.  If ANYBODY has any info about this at
all (whether the virus was real, how effective, or even if this rumor
is true!) please e-mail me at: HENRYA@UCS.ORST.EDU!!

Any help is much appreciated!!  Thanks to all respondents in advance!!

A couple of questions regarding UNIX.

1. Are there any UNIX viruses in the wild?

I have heard rumours of 'research viruses' writen for UNIX,if this is
true and the situation develops in a similar fashion to the DOS virus
arena then sooner or later some of theses 'research viruses' will be
found in the wild.

2. Are there any virus scanners available for UNIX?

Thanks in advance.

Two points here that I'd like to illuminate:

   - You don't need cleaning software, you can just restore from
     originals.  I personally agree with this, and it's definitely
     what *I* would do if I got infected.  But large organizations
     would much prefer an automatic and reliable cleanup program over
     having Z different end users per month trying to figure out what
     needs to be replaced, and from where, on their systems.  I can
     understand that, I think!  *8)   The key is that the cleanup has
     to be reliable: it should either do the job right, or warn you
     that it couldn't and you need expert assistance.  (Also, things
     aren't always as easy as you make out; using FDISK /MBR on a
     Monkey-infected system creates something that would take even
     a guru a bit of work to fix.)

   - You don't need to know which virus you had.  Yes, you do!  Once
     you've replaced the changed files with originals, wouldn't
     you also like to be sure that (for instance) the virus hasn't
     while it was there riffled through all your text files, and
     inserted little "the boss is a jerk" notices here and there?
     I certainly would...

  McAfee has a special program for boot virusses! If you look in the Virlist.
txt you can find by some virusses M-Disk. I think you need that programm to
remove the form virus safely. I'm not sure, but i think there's a

I'm using ARJ 2.41 with no difficulty. I use three anti-viral systems.

F-Prot
Integrity Master
my routine thay detects file infectors

All three routines report that my system is all clean.

If you have a virus, you got the virus  somewhere else, or you have a copy
of ARJ 2.41 that has been tampered with.

Subject: how to kill virus in boot sector ? (PC)

Dear netters,

I have a IBM compatible PC with DOS 6 and windows 3.1.
My scanning-only anti-virus software found recently a virus named Michelongelo
in the boot sector on my hard drive D. I tried to use other antivirus
softwares to kill it but failed, because they cannot even find the virus
in the boot sector !

Could someone tell me where to get software to kill above virus in boot sector?

Thank you in advance.

There is a mouch easier way to remove a FORM virus from your HD, and it can be
done (surprise) by naked DOS.
All you need is a clean boot-floppy with the sys-command on it. Boot up your
Computer from this floppy and run the sys command and you will see that the
FORM has disappeared from HD.

Subject: Please help! (Removing Generic Boot Virus) (PC)

Hi there

A friend's computer was recently infected by the Generic Boot Virus.
I gave him a copy of Clean106 which is supposed to remove [Genb].
When booting from a clean system disk and running Clean (from floppy)
on his hard- drive, he receives a "No viruses detected" message.
However, [Genb] IS still sitting on his hard-drive, as when he
reboots, the virus is loaded into memory ...and Clean picks up a
"critical virus" when scanning RAM.

Any ideas or suggestions?

Thanks

Simon

PRTAVSG.CVP   930625

                           Disinfection

A strong, albeit non-technical, reason why scanners are so popular
is the specific identification of the particular virus responsible
for an infection.  Rather than telling you merely that something is
amiss, a scanner gives you a name.  More than that, scanner authors,
given the necessity to know the specifics of a virus in order to
identify it, had an advantage in finding out how a virus infected a
file, and therefore how it could be removed.  Scanning software was,
therefore, the first to offer "disinfection" of viral infections,
either as a feature or in an adjunct program.

This would seem to be, and likely is, another reason to prefer
"scanning" antiviral software.  However, beware.  Disinfection is by
no means the optimum way to deal with viral infections.  The best
solution is to delete (and, preferably, overwrite) the affected file
or area, and restore programs from original sources.  "Boot sector
infectors" affect a whole disk, and therefore present greater
problems, but in most cases material can be recovered from infected
disks, and the disks themselves "cleansed" in various ways.  There
comes a point at which the trade-off between security and
convenience tips the scales in favour of disinfection, but be aware
of the dangers.

In many cases, disinfection is simply not possible.  An overwriting
virus, for example, will not keep any track of the material it
destroys when it dumps itself into a file.  Many viri contain bugs
which prevent the recovery of the original file.  Also, sadly,
disinfection software has been known to contain bugs which left the
situation worse after the attempted "cleanup" than after the
infection.

Generally speaking, disinfecting software will contain a
"description" of the specific viral operation of a given viral
program, so that the infection process can be reversed.  However,
virus removal is no longer the exclusive province of scanning
software.  Two types of "generic" disinfection now exist.  Some
change detection programs now store sufficient information about the
file to make an attempt to restore it if the damage is not too
severe or complicated.  Also, "heuristic" scanning is being used to
"trace and remove" viral infections.  So far testing has revealed
serious drawbacks to both of these applications, but the technology
is still in its infancy, and shows promise for the future.
