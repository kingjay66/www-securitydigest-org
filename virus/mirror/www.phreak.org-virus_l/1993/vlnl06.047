The whole point of having more than one scanner, is that there is a 
considerable amount of viruses which are considered rare, or extinct, whose 
chances of infecting you are unreal. Therefore, scanning for them is less 
likely to be needed. On the other hand, there are somy viruses which are very 
common, such as Mich, Jerusalem or even 4096. Scanning for them should be done 
more requently.

 > Remember, not all scanners are turtles...

I was predicting a future situation. Perhaps today not, but in the future, if 
viruses keep multiplying like they do, soon enough all anti-viruses will have 
to be written for protected mode, otherwise there wouldn't be enough memory 
for all virus information, or speed :-)

Ofcourse. Your idea does make more sense than mine does... Still, we both 
agree that the degree of commonness should be taken into consideration.

I believe this refers to complete file scan as opposed to checking the EXE
header only, assuming a certain virus will always have the same IP or other
header information set.

In issue 42/6 bill.lamdin mistakenly referred to some text to

The quote was too short for me to determine the author, or to

Subject: Privacy matters vs. Virus-related (All)

For those of you who attended last weeks "Ides of March" Conference in
New York -
 
I noticed a trend in discussion towards what I would categorize as
privacy issues. The Toots after-dinner discussion went far astray,
as far as discussion goes (perhaps you noticed my annoyance and
attempt to route folks discussing the topic to the appropriate
channels), but shall we address these topics as "virus" related
topics in the future? I'd like to think not, but I think many
of us would like to see legality and privacy cross paths somewhere in
the immediate future. Legality is bourne upon introduction. Simplified,
if you bitch about it loud and long enough, and it hurts someone,
somewhere, at sometime, without their permission or knowledge -- it's
criminal. Period. Common sense dictates measures that identify those
that endorse criminal computer activity be identified and punished.
This type of behavior in the computer community (as well as applied
to non-computer related activities) is unacceptable. This where the
topic of viruses comes into play, because in this capacity, they do
infringe upon computer users right to a _private_ system, if they
desire it. (Hey, that's why they call it a Personal Computer, right?)
 
The "privacy" issues outlined and discussed within the confines of the
conference "boundaries", have started to cross (again, what I
categorize as) Open Systems designs.
 
The linear definition of "Open Syetems" is constantly changing. With
the recent aquisition of USL by Novell, the workstation environemt is
changing, consistenty conforming and adapting to cross-platform
computing. Yesterday I walked up to the McGraw-Hill Professional
Bookstore and bought "The Programmer's Reference To Netware". This book
includes the interrupt level information on the Netware API. It
basically does for NetWare what Ralf Brown did for DOS.
 
Is UNIX next?  I've read Pete Radatti and Fred Cohen's "papers" in
response to David Thompson's "Why UNIX is immune to computer viuses"
paper. Hmmm....
 
Back on topic, (somewhat), for those of you who wish to address
privacy issues, there are two other pipelines if you wish to wade into
them:
 
Cypherpunks - A realtime, mail subscription service. Be forewarned:
It's high volume and sometimes very technical. In fact, last week one
of it's "former" subscribers mail bombed the remainder of the
subscribers because he grew impatient waiting to be "un-subscribed."
Topics include digital privacy, anonymous remailers, PGP encryption.
To subscribe: send a message to cypherpunks-request@toad.com

"privacy@cv.vortex.com" and must have RELEVANT "Subject:" lines.
Submissions without appropriate and relevant "Subject:" lines may
be ignored.  Subscriptions are by an automatic "listserv" system;

I hope this helps filter topical messages unrelated to computer
VIRUSES.

Subject: Swap-boot virus (PC)

I have used McAfee VIRUSCAN version 102 to scan my computer and a
virus called Swap Boot [Swb] is found. I used McAfee CLEAN-UP version
9.14V102 to clean this virus. The screen prompt that `Virus can not be
safely removed from partition table.'.  I have tried to reformat the
whole hard drive, delete the partition table and create a new one and
turn the power off before rebooting again from diskette. These do not
help at all.
                                                       
I hope someone can help me!

Good. So give him the information required if he asks it, let him read VSUM or 
your (not yet finished) VIRUS_INFORMATION
(or whatever it is you call it). But don't make him/her worried
about something that has no special meaning to him/her.

Most viruses to not temper with DATA. You probably meant "to my files" or "
Disk". If so, then I completely agree with you.

Ohh Noooooo, (But it's not such a bad idea) 8-).

True, but if you got a slow virus (which only infects when a file is 
intentionally written to), you just would say to yourself: Ah, of course the 
file has changed. I have done it by myself. You simply would regard any 
reported changes as legitimate, e.g. recompiling an EXE. That's why you couldn'
t catch "any virus".

The DOS file fragmentation, a theoretically possible infection described in 
one of Vesselin's papers, is another kind of attack you can not detect if you 
checksum your data file-based. That's due to the special structure of the two 
hidden system files, which are handled as a chain of physical sectors at boot 
time and get their file-character only after DOS is loaded (because when DOS 
is not loaded, there exists no file system). If a virus puts itself into a 
sector physically used by one of these files, moves the original sector to 
another location and changes the FAT chain for the file, an Integrity Checker 
which is not aware of this would not recognize
any change, because this change is transparent for a file-based checker, but 
the PC will load the virus at boot time.

Sorry :-)

That's alright.

Subject: New (?) 2294 virus ? (PC)

Hi virus netters,

A costomer came across last thusday, complayning about window's
the window's we installed on his system didn't work and baild out 
with an error complaying about almost everything. It was likely a virus
becase when i execute a program that isn't likely to execute normaly
(tree.com) the harddisk is quite buisy but the second time it isn't
(I mean not searching the tree !)
TBSCAN (v5.04) showed behind a lot of files a U and a K witch mean 
an undocumented dos call and an odd stack. executing a file that didn't 
have the UK flags, resulted in the fact that it did get the flags,

I have beta tested TBSCAN v5.10 witch claims it is the 2294 virus,
(v5.04 doesn't recognize it) ... it stroke me like an abnormality,
because TBSCAN had recognized all the viruses i have on stock, I v'e tried
F-PROT witch says that the file is strange but doesn't report a virus
eigter, SCAN v99 doesn't see anything, and i gonna try v102 this afternoon
Is there anybody who can tell me more about this virus. (acept it is 
2294 bytes long)

Ivar.

Subject: Michelangelo Virus - do I have it? (PC)


I just bought my first PC, a 486SX running MS-DOS 5.0. Someone gave me
a floppy with the vi editor on it. When I went to install it,
(xcopy a:\ c:\vifiles) the virus detection software that came on my PC, 
went off warning of Michelangelo in the boot sector of my a: floppy disk 
drive.  Then MSDOS kept prompting me if vifiles was a directory. Being a PC
novice, I couldn't figure out how to break out of it and accidentally hit
the y so that some of the files did get copied to c:\vifiles before I turned
off drive a:. I then deleted (del) them and removed the directory (rmdir).
When I rebooted my machine, no viruses were detected. I did not attempt to 
execute vi or anything.

My questions:

1) Could I have the virus now even though my virus detector says no?

2) If I do, how can I find it and get rid of it?

Subject: WordPerfect virus may be BUG (PC)

Greetings:

	There have been several posts about a possible "WordPerfect
Virus" where the hard disk usually runs out of space.  The most recent
posting mentioned that retrieving *.WQ1 files led to this problem.
The behavior cited may be the result of a bug in WordPerfect.

	I call this the "Infinite Retrieve" bug.  WordPerfect versions
4.2, 5.0 and 5.1 (DOS), when retrieving a damaged document file or a
foreign-format file, sometimes appears to continue "retrieving" until
you reboot the machine.  It seems to allocate only free disk space
until no more remains, yet it does not stop or report an error when
the disk is completely allocated.

	I first discovered this problem a few years ago when I tried
to retrieve a WordStar 3.3 document (actually, the original WordStar
PRINT.TST) file.  This behavior is repeatable and occurs with each of
the three versions of WordPerfect I've tried it on.  Recently, I have
encountered the same behavior with a WordPerfect 5.1 document file
with a damaged header.  As an experiment, I tried truncating this
damaged file to see how little was needed to trigger this effect.
Only a 128-byte long fragment of this broken header was enough to cause
WordPerfect to go silly.

	While later versions of WordPerfect supress the retrieving of
certain system files like its own executables and temporaries,
WordPerfect is still not clever enough to elegantly reject faulty
files.  This problem is NOT related to retrieving document files into
the current document, effectively merging them together.

Subject: Why are McAfee's reportfile-output and screen-output different? (PC)

Dear networkers,

I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this, but I'll do it
anyway. Maybe some of you have noticed that the screen output from
both SCAN.EXE and CLEAN.EXE (from McAfee Associates) is different from
the output produced when the /REPORT option is used. The output in the
report file is very brief and (for example) doesn't show if a virus is
(or isn't) removed: it only tells that a virus has been found. Why is this? 
The reason why I ask this is that I would like to process the report files
from SCAN.EXE and CLEAN.EXE in order to automatically eliminate any virus
that is found with a self-written program. So IMHO the output in the report
files should be more elaborate or at least the same as the screen-output
(this applies to both SCAN.EXE and CLEAN.EXE).

Example:
Output on the screen from CLEAN.EXE when cleaning [Stoned]:

Cleaning [stoned]

Scanning for memory resident viruses.
Scanning 64K RAM......
Drive B: has no volume label.
Scanning boot sector of disk B:

  Found the Stoned [Stoned] Virus in boot sector.
  Virus cannot be safely removed from boot sector. <--- Yes, message is there
                
 Found 1 file containing viruses.

     This McAFEE(TM) software  may.....
     Copyright (c) McAfee Associates 1989-1993. All Rights Reserved.

Output in the report file by CLEAN.EXE (with /report option) when
cleaning [Stoned] (the same disk with the same virus):

Options: b: [stoned] /a /m /chkhi /nopause /unattend /report c:\clean.log

Drive B: has no volume label.
  Found the Stoned [Stoned] Virus in boot sector.
- ---> Am I missing something here? <----

Thanks,

Right...
Tell that to Vesellin...

What you call it does not matter as you say in the above text, but only if the 
scanner can make the distinction, and if that is so... call it whatever you 
want.

It's a somewhat little known "feature" of DOS that .EXE loadable files can
also begin with "ZM" as well as "MZ".  Several viruses (as well as AV
products of course <g>) are well aware of this fact and will look for
files begining with either ZM or MZ to infect.

Shouldn't that read "Jerusalem.AntiCAD.4096"?

Try downloading VSUMX3nn.ZIP (where nn is the number of the month, like
02 for February.) From a BBS...
VSUM have a list with viruses that activates on different dates.

There is no difference in the discussions of Function 4Bh between the Norton
and Duncan Books.  The books that I referenced, Norton's Guide to PC/PS2
2nd Edition, and Duncan's Advanced MS-DOS Programming.  Both of them state that
subfunction 00h load and execute a program (as Command.com would) and that
subfunction 03h loads but doesn't execute.  Neither book makes any mention of
subfunction 01h.  The Undocumented DOS by Andrew Schulman does make some
reference to a subfunction 01h, but doesn't go into enough detail.

Either way, if a virus intends to infect any executable, and uses function
4Bh to locate executables as they are run, then simply changing the name
won't do any good, since it will still be able to find the files when they
are executed.

Subject: Strange occurances on Mar 6. (PC)


On Mar 5 I ran NAV 2.1 and CP tools A-V and they found nothing. On Mar 6
I booted and twice I got a message "cannot boot from floppy". No floppy
was in either drive. The first time was at power on boot, the second
was after replying 'yes' to reboot. I powered off and powered back on
and all has been normal. No problems with the HD. I have noticed
that sometimes the HD will start writing for no apparent reason.
Sometimes it is in a burst while sometimes it quickly repeats the writing
(this from wathing the HD active light). This is running dos/windows
on a gw2k 66v.  Any clues as what it happening?

All is appreaciated.
