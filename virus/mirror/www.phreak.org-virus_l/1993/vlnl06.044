Childhood chicken pox has virtually no mortality.  Also, about 10%
of adults in the U.S. are not immune to chicken pox.

Oh sure, this has been evident for a long time.  They just hype whatever
suits them at the time.  They have it in for certain companies and are
in the pocket of others.
	In this month's issue, Dvorak, advocates doing away with the
present BIOS, and coming up with a whole new architecture.  I agree that
the present AT style bus has many limitations but really how many people
are unsatisfied with the speed of their 486/33?  I do a lot of
numerical programming (processor intensive) and it's rare that anything really
takes that long.  
	Ok I know it's his job to get people like me to say things like
the above.  So he succeeded.  BTW, have you noticed at the end of every
one of his Inside track columns he advertises some sort of software that
he really likes.  Even though it's an "inside track" column, he's
advertising software.  I guess he's just flexing his muscle.
	I don't mean to single him out too much; some of the stuff he
writes is pretty interesting.  It just a little difficult to swallow
that we all need some sort of new machine every month when apparently
everything was working pretty good,  Basically the magazine is a whole
lot of solutions in search of problems.
	In spite of all this they can be happy to know I'll resubscribe
and that will keep the important thing intact - the money.  Grudgingly,
I'll admit they're probably the best of the lot.

That may sound plausible and it may be very convenient to believe, but
you'll have to produce some evidence to support your claim.  (Evi-
dence to the contrary: In its previous review, PC Magazine gave one
of its Editors' Choices to Alan Solomon's Anti-Virus Toolkit, and in
its first review it chose Ross Greenberg's FluShot+, despite the fact
that neither Alan nor Ross advertised in PC Magazine.)

  I think the main problem is that PC Mag's editors and reviewers are
simply amateurs when it comes to viruses.  One way in which this
manifests itself is in the fact that one of their main criteria for
Editors' Choice was that the software have a nice graphic interface.
More important, the reviewers don't have the slightest concept of
security holes.  They properly emphasized that known-virus scanning
isn't enough.  But they gave lots of points to products just because
they include some kind of integrity checking and generic monitoring
protection.  It doesn't seem to have occurred to them that there may
be tremendous differences in the quality of such software, that it may
be very simple for a virus to circumvent this protection in some of
the products, and that it's necessary to compare the products on this
basis as well.

  One other point.  Fred, I can't help suspecting that a major cause
of your writing as you did above was that the Integrity Toolkit which
you developed wasn't included in the review.  That's very unfortunate,
because from what I saw of it at last year's Lefkonference, it
certainly *looks* good.  However, I think this is partly your own
fault.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but as far as I know, you never
advertised it on any widespread level, gave out evaluation copies to
anyone, or made a shareware version available.  How then were the
editors supposed to even *know* of its existence?

Hold on.  I think you may have something here.  Since when has
legal terminology been required to match up with common usage?
Perhaps "malicious software" is just what we need to define as
a legal term.  Especially since the definition of virus is so
mutable....

Read Andrew Shulman's "Undocumented DOS". Int 2F Fn 13 will return the path 
to Int 13 DOS found when loading. If it does not point to the ROM BIOS or a 
controller card ROM, you have a problem (how you WILL know). If your program 
runs at the BIOS level like mine do, the table vector *must* point to the 
ROM BIOS or a disk controller if the machine is clean.

At BIOS time, high RAM does not exist and every Intel processor is in REAL
(8086) mode. Things are very predictable.

A virus can intercept an interrupt vector. It cannot intercept as FAR CALL.
All you need to know is where to make the far call to (the exercise is left to
the student). *No* virus can infect ROM memory unless built in at the factory.

Would you care to bet your PC on it ? Perhaps I was being too gentle. EVERY
A-V I have seen that flags the compressed drive has been missing the real
DBR. Further, with the possible exception of the DOS 6.0 compression (haven't
gotten that far in studying it yet, it blew up on the test XT) every one
of the compression schemes I've looked at have layered their driver on
top of DOS and intercept INT 25 & 26, not 13. If you use 13, you will never
see the compressed disk boot sector. Is that clear enough ?

Legitemate opinion. Mine is that compressed drives make so much sense that
they will become a standard. The key is in the recovery programs and they are
maturing nicely.

>It remindes me of the EXPANDED memory cards that people used to buy once, and

I have not yet reached the point of being able to treat PCs as disposable 
items, nor would I want to. Extended memory is a valuable attribute for
386 and higher machines. I still have 2 XT class and 1 AT class machines that
see regular and valuable use. My next *major* purchase will be a parallel port
ethernet adaptor for my laptop. I suspect that like myself, most readers are
not independantly funded.

Just for a data point, I ostensibly have some PC support

75 PCs).  We had no infections of Michelangelo (though 
this may have been mitigated in part because March 6 fell 
on a Saturday this year).

However, one of our senior scientists who frequently 
shuffles files between home and work did turn on his PC
on Saturday and found that he couldn't boot his and it

Fortunately, he was backed up.

Subject: Which Virus is this? (PC)

A friend of mine apparently got hit by a virus (poor guy! - just
another statistic...) several days ago, before March 6 I believe.  The
details are a bit sketchy, since he hastily reformated his hard drive
after the incident. Actually, he had thought that his hard drive had
gone bad, so initially, he actually went out and bought a new hard
drive!

He claims that all his executable files (.EXE) were renamed to
.COM. Also, the virus apparently rewrote some of his CMOS
settings, since the computer would not recognize his hard
drive. Correction: sometimes it would not recognize his hard
drive, but at other times, he could boot up the drive (maybe
the boot sector was affected?)

I would like to know what virus this might possibly be, not
only because of curiosity, but because he and I often use the
computers at school (where he might have caught the virus), and
I would like to protect myself from this particular virus.

Thanks,

Hi virus netters,

A costomer came across last thusday, complayning about window's
(who ain't, only people who bougt a 486DX/66 with 2Mb cach local bus ide +
8Mb and a local bus video, don't complain :-) )
the window's we installed on his system didn't work and baild out 
with an error complaying about almost everything. It was likely a virus
becase when i execute a program that isn't likely to execute normaly
(tree.com) the harddisk is quite buisy but the second time it isn't
(I mean not searching the tree !)
TBSCAN (v5.04) showed behind a lot of files a U and a K witch mean 
an undocumented dos call and an odd stack. executing a file that didn't 
have the UK flags, resulted in the fact that it did get the flags,

I have beta tested TBSCAN v5.10 witch claims it is the 2294 virus,
(v5.04 doesn't recognize it) ... it stroke me like an abnormality,
because TBSCAN had recognized all the viruses i have on stock, I v'e tried
F-PROT witch says that the file is strange but doesn't report a virus
eigter, SCAN v99 doesn't see anything, and i gonna try v102 this afternoon
Is there anybody who can tell me more about this virus. (acept it is 
2294 bytes long)

Paul,

We've been getting reports of many virus outbreaks in South Africa
lately.  Could you provide some factors that you believe is
contributing to this?  Are there any particular hotbed locations
within S. Africa or is it simply the whole of S.Africa?

 Bill, this area is called "stack space". The oiginal sample of the
 Minnow-V (the original name of the virus; I think one of the McAfee
 programmers named it Zero Hunt) that I isolated (check your sources)
 would only infect .COM files that contained 416 contiguous bytes of
 00h stack space. It does not use the DOS copy buffers for a transfer
 area the way the Darth Vader viruses do (you must be confusing the
 two viruses), but rather, Minnow-V is an infect_on_execute (host),
 TSR virus. According to Patti Hoffman's reference, there is a 411 byte
 variant, although I have never seen it.
 
 Hope this clears things up for you.

To whomever that can help me with this catastrophic dilemna,

     I recently discovered that a virus exist within my computer.  My PC is
stacked with a Stacker.  I used the Norton Anti-Virus to scan the drives and
it advised me to turn off the computer and boot it up again with an un-affected
boot disk.  Since my drives are stacked, the NAV would not read drive C or D.

I also tried to boot it up with the Stacker files in the un-affected DOS boot
up disk.  Once I use the NAV to scan the drives, it would say there is a virus
detected in the memory and then it would not scan any further.  This goes the
same for scanning the floppy drives. 

The virus is called Stoned.  What should I do?  If anyone has come across this
or has a solution to this problem, I would appreciate it if you could contact
me.  Even if anyone would like to look into this issue or inquire about the
problem, please feel free to email me or respond to this posting.

Old, semi-well documented Word Perfect bug!  Each time you edit/save a
file, especially if you change printer definitions (e.g. you load up a
file and WP says "Reformatting Document for Default Printer") WP adds
the printer definition information to the "header" (top) of the file.
The solution is to retrieve the existing document into a blank 
(current) document.  I tried to search the WPCORP-L archives for
more specific information, but was unable to come up with any
hits.  You should repost your question to that group and they'll
be able to give more specifics.

First question: what virus was it, and how did you detect it (hopefully not 
by its trigger :(  .....) It's not the EXEBUG virus by any chance is it?
BTW Just running FDISK isn't enough - you need to run FDISK /MBR (from DOS
v5) to re-write the Master Boot Sector - but more on this below...

In answer to your second question (briefly):

When a machine is first switched on, the power supply activates and voltages 
begin to build to their normal operating levels within the machine. A 
hardware timer will eventually trip and kick the main processor into action, 
whereupon it will start executing a program stored at a fixed address in ROM.

This program enables the processor to carry out sensible hardware tests and, 
in ATs, collects information from the CMOS of the machine about its hardware 
configuration. All of this sequence is referred to as the Power On Self Test, 
or POST.

The actions at this point vary depending on the BIOS installed in the 
computer. The original PC design intended that the machine would check if a 
floppy disk was present in the A: drive, and if one was, would boot from it. 
If no floppy disk was found, the machine is booted from the hard disk. 
However, some BIOSes provide a way to disable the floppy disk boot sequence 
so that it is impossible to pick up a pure boot sector viruses by accident. 
In this case the PC will boot from the C: drive by default.

The early versions of MS-DOS used a similar method of booting either from 
floppy disk or hard disk. However, as disk drives got bigger, different 
routines were developed for hard disk boots. In order to cope with multiple 
partitions etc a sector (called the Master Boot Record or Master Boot 
Sector), located at track 0, head 0, sector 1 is loaded and executed. This 
code examines the data held in the partition table and locates the position 
of the active partition on the disk. The code then loads this second boot 
sector (called the DOS Boot Sector or Partition Boot Sector) which in turn 
loads the appropriate system files.

So, for a hard disk boot sequence:

BIOS: Switch on, and load POST routines
      Load and execute MBR from track 0, head 0, sector 1.

MBR:  Examine the Partition Table and find the entry marked 
      as active. Load the associated DOS Boot Sector and
      execute it.

DBS:  Load the system files and pass control to them.

Therefore, if you boot from a clean floppy, and fdisk/MBR and SYS your hard 
drive, any boot sector virus is gone, right? WRONG :(

All BIOSes are created equal - but some are more equal than others. If the 
CMOS information tells *certain* BIOSes that there are no floppy disk drives 
present on the system then the machine is booted from the hard drive. 
Therefore every time you FDISK or SYS the hard drive, the virus re-infects, 
because you are attempting to disinfect with the virus active in memory. 
This doesn't work on all PCs, but is a problem on some. However, there are 
free utilities available which can disable the virus in memory, and then 
disinfect the hard drive. It's messy, but unfortunately that's the way it is. 
Low level formatting works too, as this routine is usually executed from ROM. 
However, Low level formatting is a last resort - you don't need to do that 
to recover.

There was a four page article in the December Virus Bulletin on exactly 
what happens when a PC boots up (pp 5-8) - if you want more info, let me know.

Yours aye,

Most TSR writers disagree with you especially since DOS is built for
TSRs. If you're right you should be warning anybody using any sort of
TSR with Stacker (including keyboard handlers, EMM386, Windows, etc).

I tested virstop from f-prot 2.07 against the two Monkey strains.
You are correct: it doesn't notice them on an infected system.  It
does notice if a system is infected with "Stoned".  I think the 
reason is probably that Monkey uses a level of stealth that may be
keeping virstop from seeing the infected MBR.  And in memory it is
installed not at "Top of Memory", but at offset 200h from TOM.  So
a device that checks what is at TOM won't find the virus there.

I tested the f-prot 2.07 scanner as well.  Scanning diskettes, it
correctly identifies Monkey variant 1, but still calls Monkey variant
2 a "new variant of stoned".  F-prot cannot find either variant on
a hard disk, if you boot from a clean floppy, because Monkey encrypts
and moves the partition table data, so f-prot can't find the hard 
disk partitions at all.  (It should still be able to check the MBR,
though.)

I am not sure the fprot I tested was the very latest, though:
I think Frisk has released some bug-fixed versions.

As to a solution, the easiest is probably to get killmonk.zip from
your favorite ftp site.  (For example, it is at oak.oakland.edu,
in /pub/msdos/virus.)

  I believe both signify an EXE file. Someone correct me if I'm worng, 
but it is my understanding that both "MZ" and "ZM" mean that it is an
EXE..

Subject: FIXUTIL4.ZIP from A. Padgett Peterson (PC)

Hi fellows.

Just received and made available for anonymous FTP the new suite of virus
defence programs from A. Padgett Peterson.  Following is an excerpt of the
"what's new" file:

- ----- begin excerpt --

FixUtilities copyright (C) 1989-1993 by Padgett - all rights reserved.

FixUtil4 is the March 1993 revision of the FixUtils.

WHAT'S NEW
The major change is that the FixUtils are now all FREEWARE. 

Major Changes
FixMBR now generates automatically a copy of the original MBR with
a user designated name of up to 7 characters. This .DAT file should be
stored in a safe place off-line. When changed to a .COM file and executed,
the original MBR will be restored.

On machines having BIOS selection of the boot disk, users may now select
booting only from the C: drive for additional protection from viruses.
If the CTRL key is held down during the boot, SafeMBR, following integrity
checking of the hard disk MBR will transfer the boot process to drive A:
to allow booting from floppy for maintenance purposes.
