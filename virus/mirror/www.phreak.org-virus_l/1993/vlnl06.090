Well, you've now heard from at least one of them. Based on the reports from
conference attendees and the response from the conference organizers to the
reported problems, ACM/SIGSAC has withdrawn its "In Cooperation With"

Not quite, the signature update for the DOS portion appears identical
(according to FC). The .DLLs (Windows portion) are the same exact size but
are different - probably just logos/messages but haven't checked further.

Exactly so though do not know why this should be necessary, all MSAV should
be doing is reading the disk (or will VSAFE decide that MSAV is a virus 8*).
I have quite a few resident programs that do not bother any A-V products

Why ? Though I am equally incompetant legally it would seem that CP might
copyright their signatures (and this is questionable, they would have to
prove originality of the strings), what you have is a program that accepts
input. There are no legal restrictions to that input any more than Microsoft
can limit sales of Wallpaper .BMPs or Lotus can limit 1-2-3 templates. What
we are dealing with is a *format* not a program and insofar as I have been
able to ascertain the courts have taken a consistantly dim view on attempts
to restrict these.

The DOS updates can indeed be used with the DOS version of MSAV.  One
simply has to rename the virsigs.cps file to virsigs.ms.  Other than the
included instruction file (copy file to program directory...) the files
are identical in the MSAV and CPAV DOS updates.  Now... the Windows
version... the DLLs and sig files seem completely different.  Maybe
someone who uses DOS 6 should try renaming and plugging the CPAV Win
update files into MSAV Win...

Subject: What to do about Quox virus? (PC)

I just now ran across a diskette infected with the "Quox" virus
(according to F-Prot), yet F-Prot cannot remove it, nor does it
have any information about it. I looked in the backlog of messages
on VIRUS-L and could find no recent mention of it.

I'm curious what its particular effects are, bugs, etc. Any sources
of information to be had?

Please respond via e-mail, even though I'll be watching the group
closely for responses....

Subject: Misidentification by F-Prot 2.08a (PC)

Greetings.

Our lab just survived our first viral infection.  Symptoms were that any
executable program residing on the hard-drive would refuse to execute, and
the machine would lock up, following booting.  F-Prot 2.08a identified the
virus as a _Screaming Fist_ variant, while McAfee's Scan program said that
it was a combination of a boot sector virus, [Genp], with the _Stickey_
[ML2] virus infecting the .com and .exe files.

One other characteristic of the virus was that it wasn't terribly bright,
in that one of the .com files that it infected was a DCL .COM file downloaded
from my VAX. (for the vaxophobic, it's an ascii text file, similar to a .bat).

I was able to disinfect the [Genp] with complete success using Clean, and
[ML2] with partial success.  Files that were for protected mode applications
tended to be unrecoverable.  F-prot was unable to do either.

Being as we've relied on periodic scanning with F-Prot here at the
university as the primary means of virus detection, how often does
this happen (misidentification, or identifying two viruses as a
third)?  Secondly, does anybody have any further information on the
viruses that the program detected?  We have a lot of data move through
our computers, and would like to avoid losing any more to this type
of incident.

Thank you for your time.

Subject: Re: On the merits of VSUM (PC)

You recently gave some very constructive criticism of Patricia Hoffman's VSUM.
In contrast, McAfee's VIRLIST.TXT provides succinct descriptions of the general
behavior you can expect from any particular virus on it.  One of these types of
behavior is installing in memory, but that's as much detail as it gives on the
matter (again, it's succinct).  As you know, there are many different ways a
virus can install itelf in memory, which is reflected in VSUM.  Here's her
legend - this is from a rather old version, but I wouldn't be surprised if she
still uses the same classification system:

        R = Resident (in memory)
          (below 640k - segment A000)
              a - in unused portion of allocated memory
                  (does not change free memory, such as virus resident
                  in CLI stack space or unused system memory)
                  Example:   Lehigh
              f - in free (user) memory below TOM
                  (does not prevent overwriting)
                  Example:   Icelandic
              h - in high memory but below TOM
                  (Resides in high system memory, right below TOM.
                  Memory is allocated so it won't be accidently
                  overwritten.)
                  Example:   Flash
              s - in low (system/TSR) memory
                  (reduces free memory, typically uses a normal
                  Int 21/Int 28 TSR)
                  Example:   Jerusalem
              t - above TOM but below 640k (moves Int 12 return)
                  (Reduces total memory size and free memory)
                  Example:   Pakistani Brain
          (above 640k)
              b - in BIOS/Video/Shadow RAM area (segment A000 - FFFF)
              e - in extended/expanded memory (above 1 Meg)

Could you please provide some comments on the accuracy of VSUM in this one
specific area of analysis?  The reason I think this is helpful is that it
gives you an idea of what viruses can install in memory without being detected
by programs such as TBDRIVER/FILE, FLUSHOT, SECURE, etc.  For example, the
first two each have a problem detecting suspicious memory allocation and use,
which might allow viruses such as, according to her example, Flash, to slip
past them.  SECURE, on the other hand, doesn't seem to bother alerting the
user when a program makes a TSR request (maybe it's supposed to, but it didn't
in the time that I tinkered with it), which might allow simple viruses, such
as, again by her classification, Jerusalem, to install without any questions.
But obviously, her analysis is of no help at all if it's wrong.  I don't know.
I don't have the viruses to verify any of this.  I only ran a few tests on the
security programs to see if they'd be triggered under the conditions I would
want them to be, above scenarios included.  Thanks.

VIRSTOP normally takes up 15K.  VIRSTOP /DISK uses 2K.  Could it be that
VIRSTOP /DISK *initially* needs 15K and then shrinks down to 2K, but MEMMAKER
puts it into the wrong region of upper memory based upon the 2K assumption?
I know of many TSR's that "shrink" once their initialization code is complete.

According to the DOS 6 manual, MEMMAKER does not try to figure out the optimal
ORDER of program loading in config.sys/autoexec.bat (I think QEMM does).
The ordering of programs can be crucial for the very reason mentioned
above (program shrinking).  For instance, if VIRSTOP /DISK is loaded from
autoexec.bat there may not be enough upper memory to complete the task
(you may have 8K of upper memory but you need 15K for the
initialization even though the program only takes up 2K in the end!).  If
VIRSTOP is loaded as one of the first programs from CONFIG.SYS (after
DOS=HIGH,UMB of course) then you'll have plenty of room for VIRSTOP and
(possibly) 12-13K of programs you may not have been able to run otherwise
(15-2=13).  On our DOS6 machine (DEC 386-25,2 meg RAM, 80meg SCSI) MEMMAKER
couldn't  squeeze out any further upper-memory than my "hand-optimization"
(I have 2K left) and VIRSTOP was left as-is (no crash after running memmaker).

I would guess that since no-one has complained about QEMM crashing VIRSTOP,
the fault lies with MEMMAKER (surprise surprise surprise - Gomer Pyle). But
whether MEMMAKER can or can't determine VIRSTOP's size or whether the problem
is because MEMMAKER doesn't re-order the loading of programs is a
different question.  I haven't played with QEMM sufficiently enough to know.

Subject: Re: The Anti-Viral Software of MS-DOS 6 (PC)

  Concerning the messages which F-PROT outputs about finding search
patterns in memory, I had written:

The experimental facts which I have found are this:  Without VSafe
loaded in memory either currently or since booting, I run first MSAV,
then F-PROT.  F-PROT outputs the message "The Telecom virus search
pattern has been found in memory."  Now how can VSAFE be the problem
when *it isn't even loaded in memory*???

  What is clear is that in this case F-PROT is complaining about what
*MSAV* has left in memory, not about VSAFE.  It is also clear that
F-PROT is giving a false positive.  The only question is: Which scan-
ner is at fault: MSAV or F-PROT?  If instead of running F-PROT (after
MSAV) I run SCAN, FINDVIRU, or UTSCAN, no message is output.  Since
the other three scanners disagree with F-PROT, the most likely answer
is that it is F-PROT which is at fault in this case.
  Admittedly, the situation changes when VSAFE is loaded in extended
memory (in this case F-PROT complains that the Stoned pattern has been
found).  This time it may sound as if VSAFE is guilty.  But here
again, the other three scanners say nothing.  So I tend to think that
it is F-PROT which is at fault in the present case too.

I think, a virus can also physically destroy tracs: he has only reformat some
tracs with its own sector numbering. OK, it's only possible on old MFM/RLL or
ESDI-HD-Drives, and I don't know viruses doing this, but like you can see ...

Subject: Redirection Difficulty (PC)

I'm trying to investigate how programs trap I/O and redirect it. The
specific problem that I have is how does a program tell DOS to change
its interpretation of standard input or output (or the other three
standard handles for that matter). None of my books an DOS function
(documented or undocumented) describe how to do this.

To wit, let's say you want to issue the DOS EXEC system call, and the
program you want to EXEC reads and writes to standard I/O. But suppose
you want to have DOS read or write to a file instead of the console.
Now if you were issuing a command to COMMAND.COM, redirection is easy,
but if you are trying to run a program using the DOS EXEC function,
there seems to be no documented way.

Now please don't suggest EXEC('COMMAND.COM','/C pgm parameters >file')
because no malicious software could get away with that. I don't need
to defend against such a weak attack; I want to defend against smart
attacks. How do they do it? (It is done by 4DOS at least.) All I want
to know is what do you do to have I/O redirected at the system call
level.

There are plenty of DOS internal experts here and I'm sure someone knows
the answer here.
