If virus is something "attaching" itself to programs, then some of existing

Exactement (=exactly for non-French speaking people). Don't call a "virus"
something you are not sure is a virus. How can you be sure something is a
virus? Well, some things are repeating over and over and it seems to me the
problem is virus definition again. I was following everything written about
this subject on this list and reread recently all numbers of Virus-L Digest
from no 1 to the last one (for this year). I will not summarize here what I
concluded. Instead of that I announce:

     CONTEST FOR THE BEST COMPUTER VIRUS DEFINITION      

In following categories:

1. Technical definition (in plain language - preferably English)
2. Technical definition (mathematical)
3. Legislative definition
4. Ethical definition
5. Philosophical definition
6. Poetical definition
7. Funny definition
8. Other definitions

Propositions:

1. This definition should be short as much as possible, cleared of attributes
as "good", "bad", "beneficial" or similar, not mentioning state of user's
mind,etc., it should be clearly stated for which environment (e.g. operating
system) is applicable and definition should be undoubted.
2. The meaning of every symbol in mathematical formula(s) should be clearly
explained.
3. This definition should contain statement which part of virus code could
be considered as punishable (supposing virus writing is criminal act).
4. This definition may include terms as "good", "bad", "beneficial",
"malicious", etc. The point is to stress what could be good and what is bad
in writing viruses.
5. This definition may have completely free form. However, religious
statements of type "First was a virus..." should be avoided if possible. 
6. Limerick is preferred form, but epic poems if good may also compete.
7. Preferable form is short joke. For fair play I suggest to not use any
personal names of real persons.
8. Any other definition not belonging to previous categories.

Contributions may be sent by e-mail to celustka@sun.felk.cvut.cs with subject
"contest - number of category" (e.g. contest - 1) or by snail mail to address
bellow. Everybody willing to participate may send his/her own definition or
suggest somebody else's with exact citing of source where definition could
be found (preferably sending a copy of definition). One person can compete
in more than one category with more than one definition (however limit is
five definitions/category).

Jury:

At the moment only me. Everybody who doesn't want to compete and feel enough
competent to judge quality of definitions is welcome. Just send me short e-
mail with your address and category of interest.

Prizes:

For my limited financial ability these prizes YOU WILL NOT GET:

1. Red Porsche (nor any other car of any colour nor even bicycle)
2. Two weeks on Bahamas
3. 1 000 000 $

Prizes which I can assure at the moment are:

1. Diploma for the best virus definition in respective category
2. Nice postcard from Prague

Any sponsor willing to increase the prizes fund is welcome.

Deadline:

30 June, but this term could be changed depending on interest.

Any suggestions about propositions and/or better contest organization will
be appreciated.

Enjoy the contest and let the best win!

Very helpful ? Well, keep in mind that most of the "new" viruses that
appear are not a threat "in the wild"...and by the time a virus becomes a
threat most scanners will probably be detecting it.

Also, consider that an ever-increasing percentage of new viruses uses
polymorphic encryption - so signature lists will not help...you need a
program update.

In order to achieve automatic update when a workstation logs in. If
you are using the usual go-to-every-PC-and-install-the-program

You don't understand - this -is- the virus. The anti-virus package
plus the relevant part of the system login script. When you install
the virus (as a supervisor), it modifies the system login script, by
including in it a (possibly modified) part of itself. At workstation
login, this part is executed and spreads another part of the virus
(the anti-virus package) to the workstation that logs in. The whole
process matches exactly Dr. Cohen definition for a virus and is
clearly beneficial.

That's exactly why McAfee's package is not a virus - it doesn't have
the capability to automatically update itself on the workstations.
Although you could easily add virus-like capabilities to it by some
clever login script programming and a few external utilities (e.g., to
check the current version of the package on the workstation).

Correction - got the letter yesterday. No wonder that it has taken
such a long time - the address was a horrible mess of my office and
private addresses and my name was misspelled. As it was misspelled on
my ID on the conference, and on the previous conference, and on the
"certificate" I got from the previous conference. IMNSHO, this mess is
an excellent example of the lack of organization that surrounds this
event. The organizers seem to be unable even to get their mailing
lists straight... And my name and office address can be found at the
end of any message I post to Virus-L/comp.virus - a newsgroup that
both you and Dick Lefkon have demonstrated to have access to.

Prof. Brunnstein has still not received his letter, BTW.

I see... I didn't know that - when I was using FidoNet in Bulgaria,
the SysOps used to tell me that I cannot send NetMail to anybody
outside Europe and Israel, because they are unable to dial his/her
telephone directly. (For those of you who don't know it, it is
impossible to automatically dial a number outside these areas from
Bulgaria. It can be done only via very special lines.)

Wasn't the transfer of encrypted data forbidden by the rules of
FidoNet?

To inform you about what exactly? That it is very easy to write a
virus? Doesn't the number of existing viruses (about 2,300) convince
you enough? Or don't you trust me that they are so many?

As I tried to explain to somebody else, there are other things to be
concerned about. First, while not giving viruses to anybody certainly
cannot stop the viruses from spreading, giving them to anybody who
wishes -does- help them spreading. Why should we help them? Second, by
giving them to anybody who wishes, you are damaging your reputation.
Maybe we really need a new FAQ entry?

> a.) trusting people will see what they really are up against

How exactly do you expect people to "see" this? According to your own
words, your friend has had two viruses on his computer and has not
"seen" anything. Remember, the vast majority of the computer users are
just not competent enough to handle a virus properly. Making viruses
freely available to them will only making the problem worse.

> heck, who can't make a batch program that goes

> echo Y|del *.*

Heck, a Russian hacker has written a memory resident (!) slow BAT file
infector - entirely in the BAT language... Using NO external programs
that are required to be present (DEBUG, EDLIN). Fortunately, there's a
bug in the virus and it doesn't work well, but the basic idea is
there...

Could you please explain HOW exactly a person who is not competent
enough to handle a virus will handle it better if you give him/her
free access to virus code? And WHY s/he won't be able to get better
informed by reading this forum?

> Well, anyway, I think they should be public domain.]

I think - not. They spread well enough by themselves or are spread by
the VX BBSes. No need to help them additionally.

But they do! Virus Bulletin regularly posts new virus signatures -
actually, every month. Jan Terpstra maintains a publicly available
list of virus signatures and updates it from time to time. S&S
International ships by fax urgent updates for their scanner to their
users, when this is necessary.

There are some problems with that. First, some scanners don't rely
simply on signatures. They are using the offset from the file entry
point where the signatures could be found, commands to disinfect the
virus, algorithms for polymorphic viruses, etc. Second, there is the
problem you note below, merely that

> this might be helpful to the writter of that virus

Third, some producers of anti-virus software consider their collection
of virus signatures to be a trade secret and guard it not only from
the virus writers but also from their competitors.

  There have been a lot of conflicting reports about this on
  Fido-Net.  The consensus now is that it is a trojan rather than a
  virus.  Apparently, the writer used the disk-trashing code from
  Anti-Cad/Taiwan, but not the infection code.  The program begins

From:    groot@idca.tds.philips.nl (Henk de Groot)
Subject: Boot Survival (Technical) (PC)

A week ago I patched my BIOS (EPROM) to support a new disk. To patch the
ROM and had to collect the checksum. A small C program was written to
calculate the checksum of the current bios. I was convinced that adding up
all the bytes in the current bios (from F000:0000 till F000:FFFF) should
give an answer 0. To my surprise it didn't!

What I found may be of interest to this group. I was running MS-WINDOWS and
decided to reboot the PC with a clean floppy. I ran the C program again and
the bios checksum was 0 this time! So running MS-WINDOWS seemd to 'change'
the contents of the BIOS. I realized that I was looking at (Protected) RAM
instead.

A diff reveiled what had been changed: The jump to the POST/BOOT code at
FFFF:0000 was not jumping into the BIOS anymore but to some address in the
conventional memory. This is probably the way WINDOWS 3.1 catches CTRL-ALT-DEL
or even a brute call to FFFF:0000. It could also be Smartdrive, to have the
ability to flush the cached writes this way (just guessing here). Whatever
program did it I don't know, I expect it to be a feature of MS-WINDOWS, not
a virus (I didn't bother to find out).

In the group there has been a statement that a virus cannot survive a call
to FFFF:0000 to do a cold boot. This is NOT correct. The 386 processor with
virtual memory capabilities is able to 'change' the BIOS by coping the BIOS
to RAM and swapping the pages. A virus could even hide in unused parts of
the BIOS, or other unused area's within 0K-1024K as soon as it finds out how
to exploid the 386 capabilities.

Anyway I think the only real cold boot is the reset button or even switching
the systen off and on again. The statement that there is no virus that survives
boots trough FFFF:0000 may be valid todat but may not be valid tomorrow.

Kind Regards,

Henk.

Keybxx has been part of DOS ever since 1.0 (I think) and I guess that is as
close as you can get to "built for". Even CP/M was quite TSR supporting.

But they do access the keyboard and they may/do cause trouble.

What I am pointing out is that anyone who wants to use DOS (do they?) also
has to consider the various features and the fact that some TSRs may have
bugs (same goes for the whole computer world). Whether an A/V TSR can be
more or less "painful" depends on the utility and what you combine it with.
This is the "facts of life" with DOS, Microsoft, etc.

Your aim of removing TSRs (if possible) that tamper with the disk is like
removing electricity because it is more dangerous than water.

in improving EMM386 but EMM386 is not a "bad" product in its concept

So fix the bugs, Fix the various utilities, make standards, etc. Don't condemn

I think I recall seeing the following warning in one of my books:
"Improper use of this register may cause physical damage to your monitor."

Am I correct, is there physical damage that can be done through
software? Monitors sounds likely. Disks, possibly. With CPU's
that run hot and can be configured perhaps through software, then
maybe them too!

If this is a threat should we discuss it here? I think so. Of
course, I don't want the details spelled out here. Just enough
generic information that we can be sure the info is correct.

I know of a simple way that a virus could cost a user lots of money,
[in fact the virus author could MAKE money from the victim!!!]
{if that doesn't whet the appetite I don't know what will!!!]
without causing physical damage, but I am unsure if I should
mention that here. Even though the method is absurdly simple.
Any comments?

I think this has been reported as a false alarm - Wonder is written in some
high-level language - C++, I think, and some scanners gave false positives
on programs created with the same compiler.
Anyhow, as a rule of thumb, if a scanner reports only one or two files on a
machine, and if they have been in use for a while - you are likely just to
have a false alarm.

I administer a bunch of Intel-based UNIX systems, and found that one

machine, and everything seemed mostly OK, except for the boot sector.
Upon inspection, the boot sector had been infected by the Stoned

contained a non-encrypted string.  

I installed a new boot sector and secondary boot, and all is well.

Some anti-viral programs check inside compressed files (either run-time
compression such as PKLITE or LZEXE, or archived files, such as those 
created by ARC and PKZIP).  To find out which ones do, you'll need to 
contact the developer (or distributor) of the program in question.

Most anti-viral programs will check a volume compressed with Stacker,
SuperStor, DoubleSpace, and the like as long as the correct device driver
is loaded to access the disk.

I'm not aware of any anti-viral program that checks inside floppy (or
tape, for that matter) backups made by any of the various hard disk backup
programs out there.  Since most backup programs perform some sort of 
compression (which would probably by proprietary) on the backups, it is
unlikely that any anti-viral program would be able to check them.

At our university we have some strange problems with keyboards,
starting a month ago. All kinds of PC's using different DOS-versions
and network operating systems, have 'stucked' ALT-, SHIFT- or CTRL
keys. Even brand-new computers show this problem. Some computers
produce a beep before getting stucked.  There is no hardware problem
(e.g. dirt). Sometimes the problems are solved using keyboard-fix
utilities or new keyboard drivers but results are unpredictable. We
have used MacAffee scanners but found nothing.

Is this some kind of virus? I coudn't find a virus description with similar

Hmm... 5lo is an obscure Polish virus... Are you calling from Poland
(I'm not familiar with the VirNet addressing scheme)? It -might- be a
false positive, because Frisk (and I) had problems to replicate the
virus, but 60 files... No, it sounds like a real infection...

Anyway, this is a resident EXE-only infector that infects files when
you execute programs. The programs being infected are not necessarily
those being executed - on each Exec the virus does a
FindFirst/FindNext, like a non-resident virus...

Look at the end of the files reported as infected - can you spot a
text string like '92.05.24.5lo.2.23'? If it is there, then your
computer is really infected.

No, that's a real virus. And the two Proto-T variants we know are
reported by F-Prot as Proto-T (Proto-T) and Proto-T (Civil War).

It's almost certainly a false positive. Wonder is a silly overwriting
virus, written in a high-level language (C). It barely works, let
alone spreads... However, because it is written in a high-level
language, it is very difficult to select a scan string for it without
causing false positives.

That's why you must always boot from an uninfected write-protected
system diskette and run your anti-virus software from a
write-protected diskette.

Because you have not write-protected your original copies. This is a

Any resident virus that infects files when they are executed. There
are probably more than a thousand of viruses that match this
description... What did your scanner report?

> What could I have done differently to save my disks?  I don't

Write protect your diskettes. Delete your executable (and infected)
files and restore them from clean originals. After booting from a
clean diskette, of course.

What do you mean that you don't know! What did the scanner say?

So probably his system is not infected. Or it is a stealth virus that
your scanner does not detect in memory and you have not booted from a
clean floppy before checking his system.

Particularly, the points to remember are:

1) Always keep backups.

2) Write protect your original diskettes.

3) Always boot from a clean diskette before doing any virus hunting.

4) Don't panic when a virus is detected. Nothing worse can happen,
unless you do it yourself.

> 	An important question I wanted answered is: what do I do when

1) Don't panic.

2) Boot from a clean diskette.

3) Replace all executable programs (including the boot sectors) that
you suspect to be infected.

> Is there another line of

It is not clear from your description what kind of defense you are
using exactly. In general, you should use a combination of scanners,
resident scanners, integrity checkers, disinfectors, and backup.

> Should I kill my EX-friend now?

This is the most stupid thing you could do - he is probably not guilty
at all about your problem...

     assignment then I would appreciate being told about it as soon as
     possible.


The thread appeared to end there as no-one could say either way. I
suspect the answer is still no. However, play it safe and always
assume that a virus has the same permissions as the logged on user.
Supervisors be extremely careful when updating public access software.
Just think how much hassle an infected LOGIN.EXE program could cause

PRTAVS4.CVP   930418
 
                         Corporate Climate
 
Part of the assessment of the user is the user environment.  This
aspect covers not only the "corporate culture" (eg. home user, user
in a large corporation with internal support staff, etc.) but also
the operating system environment.  For example, the MS-DOS
environment has a very large number of viral strains, with more
being produced every day.  The Macintosh environment has relatively
few viral programs.  Therefore, "generic" identification of "new and
unknown" viral programs is more important to MS-DOS users than to
Macintosh.  (Interestingly, while Macintosh antivirals are quite
mature, and protected Macintosh systems have a negligible infection
rate, the infection rate on unprotected Macs is astronomical.  This,
too, should be taken into account.)
 
Related to the interaction of the user and the program is the
potential negative impact of the security program.  Antiviral
programs consume time and disk space, and may also interfere with
the normal operation of the computer system.  As Jeff Richards'
first law of data security has it, you can guarantee security if you
don't buy a computer.  It's just not a very useful alternative. 
Computer systems can be secured more and more by restricting the
operations more and more, but restriction of "dangerous" operations
also restricts useful ones.  There comes a point at which the trade-
off for greater security becomes more than users want to pay.
 
An antiviral program, therefore, must be matched to the environment
in which it is to be used.  In a "low risk, low change" situation,
such as a word processing office, change detection software provides
very effective protection, without too much interference with
operations.  In a "high change" milieu, such as a software
development team, change detection software is less useful against
viral programs, although it has other helpful features.  In a "high
risk, multi risk" environment such as a college computer lab,
operation restricting software may prevent not only viral infection,
but may help to "idiot-proof" the computers as well.
 
We come, though, full circle back to the corporate climate.  It is
important also to match the type of program to the type of support
provided within the company.  Sadly, in many cases, this may prevail
against the use of a superior product.  However, note that even the
best product is of little use if improperly installed or supported. 
If routine maintenance is not performed on computers, then a scanner
will be of little use, since it needs to be updated from time to
time.  (Of course, if a company is not doing regular maintenance and
support, they in in danger of more than viral programs ...)
