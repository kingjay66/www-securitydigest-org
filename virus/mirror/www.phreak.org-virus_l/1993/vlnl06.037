Well, my original point was that such a polymorphic compiler would be
a superior method of implementation of polymorphism than, say, MtE.  I
also mentioned that polymorphism might be a good feature for antivirus
software, but I especially wanted to say that the polymorphic compiler
used in viruses would be a threat that antivirus people will
eventually have to face, although I don't think I got that across very
well.  Fortunately, I've got better things to do than try to write
one, and if this turns out to be true, I've got about as much to do
with it as Arthur C. Clarke had to do with the communications
satellite.

>What if this compiler were applied to the code for an existing
>successful virus like stoned?

	My idea for the polymorphic compiler is for it to compile some
kind of intermediate representation into polymorphic code.
Conceivibly you could put it together with the right parts and make a
C-like language, or a FORTH-like language, or whatever.  The thing I
have in mind wouldn't be able to "polymorph" existing assembly code,
although such a thing is certainly possible if you don't care about
code quality (but you do with successful viruses).

	The architecture that I'd see for a polymorphic compiler virus could
be broken down into at least four parts.

I. TEXT segment - this contains fixed data,  displayed text strings, etc and
	          is encryped by the PC (polymorphic compiler),   prehaps using
		  a one-time pad.

II. DNA segment - this contains the intermediate representation of the code
	          that the polymorphic compiler will "polymorph" occasionally
	 	  or whenever the virus writer wants it.  Also encrypted.

III. PC segment - the actual polymorphic compiler,  for which the intermediate
	          code is stored in the DNA segment itself.  As such,  the PC
		  can be shipped with the virus and is also variable,  so it
		  is not a simple attack point for antivirus software.

IV. VIRUS segment - code for the virus,  includes payload (if any) and
		  infection logic and all that other stuff.

	This sort of virus will probably be the next generation of
polymorphic viruses.  One would hope that it isn't coming soon to a
computer near you, because this sort of thing could make both file and
memory scanning obsolete, or at least orders of magntiude harder,
particularly if it were combined with the technology from Commander
Bomber.  Since it would also allow viable stealth viruses (can protect
in-memory section from scanners), it may even be able to thwart
integrity scanners.  It's the kind of thing that I don't really want
intellectual priority on if I happen to have it.

This varies depending upon local law somewhat more than virus
possession.  And, with the ignorance and hysteria pervading the
various legal systems where computers, software, and viruses are
concerned, it seems to be a matter of proving oneself innocent rather
than being proven guilty.

I just picked up the March 16th 93 issue of PC Magazine and was quite
interested in the article on antivirus software. It discussed some virus
development programs: The Phalcon/Skism Mass-Produced Code Generator, the
Virus Construction Set, and the Virus Construction Laboratory.
These programs sound scarey to me. Does anyone out there know anything
about them? Where do they originate and are they available for general
use or are they controlled as they should be?

One of my friends has a problem when printing out in MSWord 2.
When she goes to print, she seems to get a "Falling Letters" type virus
attack her printer.

Since I'm no technical or mathematical wiz could someone give me a hand here.
I have no idea (besides formatting the entire hard disk) of how to get rid
of it.  McAfee's V100 does not pick it up, so this makes me wonder what it is.

It could be attacking anything (that's the worst part).
	Print Manager
	Word
	Stylesheets
	Printer Drivers

	(I know that only exe com and overlay files usually hold viruses,
	 but it does not mean they have to attack the exe file they are in
	 to cause damage)

Well I'm just puzzeled!

Could someone give us a hand here?!??

I am seeing this proposed averagely once every couple of months. Ah,
you mean in print? In print, there was an article in Virus News
International, explaining why this is not a good idea, or more exactly
why it doesn't work and shouldn't be relied on.

> EXE and COM.

A more exact way to say this is "Some viruses look at the file
extensions". Because:

1) Some viruses (most) don't look at the file extensions at all.

2) Some viruses look not exactly for EXE and COM, but for *.CO?, *.*M,
and other weird things.

If it is one of the silly viruses of the above type. But, the viruses
of this type are usually non-resident, and non-resident viruses don't
replicate well anyway...

And many are both, and some even infect SYS files too, and some infect
boot sectors, master boot sectors, COM, EXE, and SYS files.

> And even for viruses that infect

Most probably it won't, see below.

This is trivial to be fixed by just changing 6 bytes in the command
interpreter.

This is even worse than to rename the files to non-executable
extensions. If you just swap the extensions, many of the viruses that
would be fooled by the above scheme won't be fooled any more.

Believe it or not, but most viruses are just as smart as DOS in this
case... :-)

"ZM" instead of "MZ" also works... Anyway, many viruses are doing just
that - infecting anything that DOS Execs (via INT 21h/AX=4B00h), and
determining the file type from the first two bytes of the file.

Any virus which is silly enough to rely on the file extension (like
Jerusalem), will infect such files incorrectly, so that they will
crash, I agree. But, this still will not prevent dozens of more
intelligently designed viruses to infect the files correctly...

No need to doubt it - DOS can run just anything as a command
interpreter, if you put the appropriate line in CONFIG.SYS.

The boot sector contains the names of the DOS files, not the name of
the command interpreter.

It's not in the future, sorry. Such viruses exist since 1988. The
first one was Cascade, I think...

In short - the idea of changing the executable extensions works in the
following cases:

1) It stops all non-resident viruses I've seen so far.

2) It stops the "fast infection" capability of the fast infectors.
That is, such viruses will still infect when you execute a file, but
not any more when you are copying it. However, it is possible to
design a virus that will still infect EXE files when they are copied,
even if their extension is different.

Note that the above points apply only in the general case, when you
are changing the executable extensions to something completely
different, not when you are just swapping them. The modification that
you are proposing will stop fewer viruses.

In general, changing the executable extensions is something like the
ReadOnly attribute - doesn't harm a lot and stops some silly viruses,
but by no means is a reliable protection scheme.

Speaking about changing the names, there is yet another thing you can
do at almost no cost and achieve some (not much) additional protection.
You should keep a hidden spare copy of the command interpreter and
have something like that:

CONFIG.SYS:
shell=c:\foo\bar\spare.cpy

AUTOEXEC.BAT:
copy c:\foo\bar\spare.cpy c:\command.com >nul
set comspec=c:\command.com

This way, viruses that infect the command interpreter as the first
thing they do when executed, will be fooled to infect C:\COMMAND.COM.
However, at boot time (when the virus is not yet in memory), this file
will be restored automatically from the image C:\FOO\BAR\SPARE.CPY.

Again, don't rely too much on the above - it is by no means fool
proof. It just helps a bit.

Really? I didn't know that the EICAR code is part of the CARO naming
standard. It shouldn't be, for two reasons. First, the CARO naming
scheme (which is not yet a standard, alas), does not rely on this
number. Second, FindVirus outputs an EICAR number only for those
viruses, which it is able to identify exactly. In practice, this means
almost all non-encrypted and some of the encrypted viruses. For
instance, try it with a few Cascade samples - you'll see that it
outputs one and the same EICAR number (665C6657) for ALL
Cascade.1701.* variants. Obviously, we cannot use for identification
an algorithm that produces one and the same output for -different-
viruses.

Well, they did not want to include any shareware programs at all (quite silly,
because they are the most popular ones) - therefore no SCAN, and F-PROT
only got included because we have an expanded,  commercial version available.
I am not terribly happy with the review, of course - well, it was nice
to see that I had one of the 13 (out of 24) scanners that detected all
the 11 (!!!) viruses, and that F-PROT was the only program that could
remove them all correctly, but the basic problem with the review, from my
point of view is that they did not ask any virus "experts" for advice, and
relied on incorrect or incomplete information (for example they say that 57
variants of Jerusalem exist, where the correct number is at least 125). So,
basically it is a good review of anti-virus program interfaces - their virus
collection is far too small (11 viruses is silly...they should have used at
lest the 50-100 that are in the wild), the viruses they used are old, so a
program that had not been updated for 18 months would have detected all but
one or two....and so on...

Anyhow, I wrote them a 4-page letter about this...

Subject: 1591/1575 (PC)

 Ok, some friends of mine in another department were having a network card
 (and software) installed.  The Norton Antivirus Program (NAV)
 on their computer picked up the 1591 virus when the bonehead
 network support individual installed the network files.  Two network
 files were infected as well as command.com and nav.exe (the norton
 program).  He (the network bonehead) proceeded by removing the virus
 using NAV (I don't know how he did it; I assume NAV provided some
 instruction when the virus was detected.

 A couple of days later, my friend called me to take a look at their computer.
 I ran McAfee's SCAN v 100 and it detected the 1575 virus in himem.  SCAN
 would only detect the virus when I used the /chkhi parameter.  I powered down
 the computer and rebooted from a clean floppy to determine the extent of the
 hard disk infection.  SCAN reported that no files were infected; yet SCAN
 continued to report a virus when I booted from the computers hard disk.

 When I renamed the autoexec.bat and config.sys files to *.bak, I rebooted.
 SCAN no longer reported a virus.  I isolated the problem to the fact
 that one of the files originally reported to have the 1591 virus by NAV
 was being loaded in the autoexec.bat.  When this occurred, scan would
 report a virus in memory.

 My questions:  What are the 1591 and 1575 viruses?
                Why would SCAN report the 1575 in himem but not
                  detect it's presence in the file?
                What should I do?  I am no longer loading the questionable
                  file, but I have not yet deleted it.

manufacturer and drive number info off the label.

IMHO it should not be difficult to detect the disk configuration &/or
validate the CMOS information simply by "walking the disk" e.g.
"validating" the sectors (would try Int 13 Fn 4) until an error occurs
to find the total sectors/track, number of heads, and total tracks.
IDE drives can be interrogated directly.

Given that, next you could go on a scouting expedition for partitions
making sure that the info makes sense e.g. the BPB in a tentatively
identified DBR actually points to the right sector. Of course you need
to do a bit of checking to determine which OS is in use, usually you
can tell by the presence of hidden sectors and (for DOS) the size of
IO.SYS or IBMBIO.COM with the date as a crosscheck.

Of course now you need to find a root directory but the algorithm for
detecting this is not difficult, people do it all the time by eyeball.

Sure, it is not going to be 100% effective in every case, but you could
hit 95% right now (I do better than that by hand) and by v3 should be
as close as you could get.

(unfortunately am working 60 hours a week & still need to paint my
house 8*( - ever notice that we spend 80%+ of our time doing things we
are not good at because we have no choice...

>What does fdisk do?  I had hoped it replaced the entire sector that has the
>MBR and partition table in it, and leave the rest alone, but that does not
>seem to be the case.  Am I wrong?

FDISK alone will build a P-table (*not* rebuild it) and place it in a
sector with new MBR code *if the sector is zeroed first* otherwise,
depending on the version, it may leave the original MBR code in place.
FDISK/MBR (DOS 5.0 and 6.0 only) will replace the MBR code and leave
the P-table alone.

>Is format in charge of the DBR's?  Does sys diddle with it too?

Both of these can replace the DBR code. SYS *might* not (version
again) load the Boot Partition Block found inside the DBR. FORMAT will
build the FATs and a root directory, SYS will not.

Probably the reason no-one has built a full replacement (yet) utility
yet is the sheer mind-boggling number of OS varients out there - I
just made a quick count of my DOS box and came up with 27 individual
DOSes for the IBM-PC ranging from 1.25 to 6.00.0560 (revision "A"
naturally).

Unfortunately, if you pick the wrong one and leave the registers with
the wrong values following the DBR execution, POP goes the weasel.

While it's true that it's "possible" you have a virus, the chance of a
single file being lost being due to a virus is sooooooo smalllllll...

And in the face of no other strangeness occurring on your system, your
chance drops to nil.

You should look to something other than viruses to explain your problem.

No.  NAV 2.1 checks for high 1400 to low 1500 strains.  And in order
to get that many, you must have NAV 2.1.

NAV 2.0 users may upgrade to NAV 2.1 through a number of programs.
Depending on your date of purchase of the product, the upgrade may be
free.  Call 1-800-343-3714, x738 for details.  Be sure to specify that
you got NAV by buying NDW 2.0.

Yes.  But there's a difference between erase (reset) and erase
(corrupt).

Many viruses fiddle with CMOS bits, some fiddle with it
incorrectly and corrupt certain values.  But none that I
am aware of deliberately go and reset all the CMOS values.

In this case, trust your judgment against the computer repair
person.  Since he brought up "Stoned," you should scan your
other machines and diskettes.  But you should also insist that
the computer repair person scan his machines and diskettes.
Not to blame the repair person but he generally has fewer machines
to check than you do.

Please send me a copy of your program electronically.  I would

Our definition for CVIR has not changed since its inception in July

Subject: CLEAN 102 (PC)

Tonight (March 1st) McAfee released version 102 of SCAN, CLEAN, & all.
The documentation states that the removal routines for several of the
viruses including MICHELANGELO have been re-written. Accordingly the
trusty VP-1600 was cranked up once more.

Like last time SCAN properly recognized the [Mich] lurking in the MBR
but this time CLEAN properly, correctly, and safely removed the virus.
What ever the bug in V100 was, it is now corrected within two weeks of
its isolation. That is a quick turnaround and shows that they are
concerned.

Sh*t happens. *Everyone* makes mistakes particularly in complex code
(heck, the last time I looked DEC still hadn't gotten FORTRAN right
8*).  The true measure of a company is whether they admit it publicly
(see last week's VALERTs) and how fast it gets fixed.

WHAT'S NEW

VIRUSCAN, NETSCAN, and SCAN for Windows

     Version 102 of the VIRUSCAN series adds detection of 74 new
viruses, bringing the total number of known viruses to 1,134, or
counting variants, 1,830.
     Version 101 gave a false alarm on the Parity virus [Pvar] and
was recalled from distribution.  It was not released on the Internet.

CLEAN-UP

     Disinfectors for the VirDem-824 and Barrotes viruses have been
added.  Disinfectors for the 1575, FORM, KeyPress, and Michelangelo
virus have been re-written.

VSHIELD

     VSHIELD Version 5.22V102 has had several changes made internally
to the program, most notably in the /ACCESS, /COPY, and /SWAP switches.
The CHKSHLD program has been re-written to work with all versions of
VSHIELD.

NOVELL NETWARE/386 3.11 PROGRAM

     NETSHIELD Version 1.11 (V102) is a NLM (NetWare Loadable Module)
for Novell NetWare/386 Version 3.11.  It checks network file servers
for all known computer viruses, including stealth and polymorphic
(mutation engine) viruses, using McAfee Associates' VIRUSCAN virus
scanning technology.

     Key features of NETSHIELD include checking files for
viruses as they are accessed on the server, performing a
scheduled scan, and notifying users if a virus is found.
NETSHIELD does not changed the Last Accessed Date when
scanning files.

     NETSHIELD runs on any Novell NetWare/386 3.11 file server
with a minimum of 560Kb of free memory and should utilize about
4% of the CPU.  NETSHIELD is not compatible with version 3.10
of Novell NetWare/386.

OS/2 PROGRAMS

     The OS/2 versions of VIRUSCAN, NETSCAN, and CLEAN-UP Version 102
are available by anonymous ftp from the mcafee.com site in the
pub/antivirus directory.  They have all the same additions as their
DOS counterparts
