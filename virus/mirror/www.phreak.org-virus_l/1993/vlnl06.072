Both.  The first amendment gives one the right to say and publish.  It does
not OBLIGATE someone to do so.  If one wants to publish virus code, then one
can.  If one does not, then one doesn't have to.

Also, the first amendment does not obligate me to help this person by
letting him/her use my computer, BBS, or printing press to publish virus
code.

Therefore, I don't see any problem if virus researchers refuse to help
people create viruses by not distributing certain information.  They are
under no obligation to give out virus source code and 40-HEX to anyone that
asks for it.

F-prot at least uses very specific wording when reporting a virus that the
user has defined the signature to.  It reports "File contains the XXXX
pattern" where XXXX is the name you gave.  This reporting carefully avoids
the use of the word "virus", so it is unlikely to cause panic, though it
will certainly arouse suspicion!

I wouldn't mind seeing some virus signatures posted occassionally, especially
if the viruses have become widespread fairly quickly-- i.e. they have somehow
found their way into a popular piece of software available via anon. FTP.
F-prot gets updated about every two months, which is quite a while for new
viruses to pop up-- it would be nice to be able to add signatures to it.
(This is also another good reason to use an integrity checker as a supplement
to your array of scanners!)

But it only "spreads" in two levels ("install" "infects" login script,
login script "infects" AV on station). The second level never continues
to "infect". I don't really think this should fit the definition of a
virus (and if it does, IMHO the definition is flawed). I would consider
this as the "install" program ("trojan horse" in itself) planting a "trojan
horse" in the login script which places a non-replicating program in the
various computers.

A possible correct test for whether something is a trojan horse (and not a
virus) is whether you can give instructions (on a system which you do not
"scan") what exact file (name) not to run (in this case the install program) or
what commands to remove from a *specific* command file (login script).

I know this is a fuzzy definition ("Don't run the 'boot sector program file'"
(that's the "name") "and you won't get infected with the Michelangelo virus"
or "Remove the batch_file virus (which infects only the autoexec.bat) commands
from the 'autoexec.bat' batch file and you won't be "infected"), but you could
add the fact that the initial "infection" has been caused by a specific program
that you ran on your "system" (network) and won't be "spread" to another
"system" and perhaps you could come up with a more exact definition.

Sounds confusing...

Subject: Damaging monitors by software

   I have a suspicion that the horizontal deflection cicuitry of quite a few
(older?) monitors didn't contain the usual horizontal oscillator/sync circuits;
instead, they looked more like a straight amplifier (with the horizontal sync
pulses as the input). This was probably cheaper to implement, but if the
sync pulses were lost for any reason (or their frequency was outside the
bandwidth of the "amplifier"), the horizontal output transistor was left
without any drive, resulting in its early demise (the bias circuitry depended
on drive being present, it seems). This certainly used to happen with old
valve-type (tube-type for you Americans) TVs, where the horizontal output
valve would usually overheat and fail if the horizontal oscillator valve
failed.

Now my question is:
1. Is there a safe way to clean the flip virus without destroying the FAT
of the boot sector.
2. If it destroys the FAT again, is there anyway I can retrieve all the
files on that hard disk?
BTW: CPAV identified the virus as Omicrom, if this information helps.

I did cause something like damage with a tchenglab 512Kb vga card and
a hitatchi monitor, This VGA card comes with some programs that enable
you to change some hardware like stuff on your card. I let the program
do all kind of triks with the scanrate and interlase of my monitor and
than ... Bang, nothing more It frigtend me rather a lot (i paid it
myself) but after i turned off the monitor and turned it on again,
nothing was wrong.  I have this theory about this, the hitatchi isn't
the cheapest one so there mightbe something in the monitor that
prevents it from blowing up.

I know that not every VGA card is capable of this and i don't think
there is something like a standard for this eigter s this is probably
not a real threat but if there are some programs that make my monitor
break down, why can't those programs not be so smal and copy
themselves (I shurely don't hope so)

Subject: FPROT: Virus scanner (PC)


\dos\virus\fprot208.exe

F-PROT is able to find practically all known viruses, by a method known as
"scanning".  This involves searching for a virus pattern or "signature" - a
sequence of bytes which is very unlikely to be found anywhere but in this
particular virus.

The virus signatures are stored in a file named SIGN.DEF, which must be present
in the current directory or the same directory as F-PROT.EXE. The number of
signatures contained in this file is not an indication of the number of viruses
F-PROT is able to detect, however - as most new viruses are created by making
small changes to older viruses, the same signature can often be used to detect
many different viruses.

Secure Scan, Quick Scan or Heuristic Analysis ?

F-PROT can use three different methods when scanning for viruses.  The first
method ("Secure Scan") uses two different signatures for each virus.  It will
also search for the signatures in a large block of data - usually (but not
always) located either at the beginning or the end of the file.  This improves
the chances of detecting any virus which might have been created by modifying
an older one - any change might cause a signature to be located at a different
position within the virus, or it might even corrupt the signature itself, but
the chances of a single change invalidating both of the signatures are
practically zero.

"Quick Scan" is, as the name implies, a faster method than "Secure Scan", but
it is also less secure.  This is because it only uses a single signature for
each virus, and to speed things up further, "Quick Scan" does not spend time on
an accurate identification of any virus it might find.

"Quick Scan" will just report a "Jerusalem" infection, while "Secure Scan"
might report an infection by the "Anarkia-2B" variant of Jerusalem, for
example.  Most users are not concerned with the accurate identification of any
virus which might strike - all they want to know is if they have a virus or
not, and "Quick Scan" is almost as good at finding known variants as "Secure
Scan" (There are a few "dead" viruses which "Quick Scan" will not detect).  If
you select "Quick Scan", you cannot select any disinfection, as it requires an
accurate identification, so the "Action" option is disabled.  As "Quick Scan"
will not search for Trojans or user-defined strings, the "Targets" option is
disabled as well.

The third method uses a set of rules, instead of a signature database. It is
still only experimental, but its purpose is to detect suspicious code.  It is
not foolproof - it will not detect all viruses and may easily produce false
alarms, so it should be used with care - not recommended for the casual user.
However - unlike the other two methods, it is not limited to existing viruses
or variants of them - it is equally effective against new viruses.  For further
information on this method see ANALYSE.DOC

>From the documentation of the Atari ST anti-virus program 
Virendetektor (translated from German):


In chapther 1 I have already mentioned some fundamental effects that 
can be caused by viruses.  But there exist also very vicious viruses 
which can even partly cause damage on the hardware, because they e.g. 
repeatedly move the read/write-head of the disk-drive/harddisk 
against the stop, or (for IBM-compatible computers with Hercules 
card) program the graphics card in such a way that it can be 
irreparably damaged.

Another danger threatens owners of colour monitors!  One can even in 
colour mode induce the ST at changing the frame frequency to the 
(monochrome) frequency of 71 Hz.  By this the row frequency is 
changed from 16 MHz to 36 MHz.  The "emergency reset", which the ST 
normally execute in such case, can be blocked by software.  If you 
one day happen to have a dozen of colour monitors left you can 
quietly test how long a colour monitor survives this procedure.  
Present extrapolations vary from a second to a few minutes.  In any 
case it is sure that within a rather short time your colour monitor 
will opt out for ever.  (The latest tests with original ATARI colour 
monitors have shown that some monitors were unruffled for as long as 
half an hour.)  A virus that wants to cause damage to your hardware 
might make use of these circumstances.  That no such virus has yet 
been made is probably because of the difficult program- technical 
realization of the above scheme.

Yes, there is such a program...and it's called Integrity Master <g>.
Seriously, I think you can accomplish what you want by using SetupIM to
ask Integrity Master to keep the integrity data on diskette.  This will
place all the integrity data in a secure place and will not change anything
in your hard disk directories.  At present, we don't support a single
data base on the hard disk to describe all your files and system
sectors.

Integrity Master did have a single data base in the original (1988 beta)
version of the product. This was perceived much less convenient by our
original user base.  The integrity data would not follow the files and
it was much more difficult to extract a subset of Integrity Data to
correspond to a set of files.

ST>Are there any plans to add this feature to integrity Master?

We are considering making a single database an option but we have no
firm plans for this at this point.  One problem with this is keeping
the code size of Integrity Master down.  If we do this it will probably
have to a be a separate version of the product.  Having tried both versions
in the past, we've found that most people strongly prefer the current
architecture.  People that don't like integrity data in each directory
of their hard disk simply choose to keep the integrity data on floppy.

as far as I can tell, to claim copyright your real name must appear with it.  
Obviously, most virus writers dont want to do this. However, if sometime did

Very true, most people will want to read about these viruses.  But wouldn't
it be nice if they could also read CORRECT information?

One of my ideas from last time was to incorporate a novice/expert type switch.
Were VSUM more structured, with fields for some of the more technical aspects
of virus activity, these could be easily left out at the "novice" setting.
Just backing up what VSUM says about viral activity with a few facts about
what the virus does will increase the credibility of VSUM immeasurably.

For example, saying "This virus is incompatible with Novell" is strengthened
greatly by adding "since this virus uses the Novell print spooling interrupts
as its installation check".  Users who select "novice" would only see the
first part.  Users who select expert could see all of it, and go "oh, that
makes since then", rather than just going, "now why is that??".

True, but occasionally VSUM even gets this wrong.  Generally speaking, though
the very basic information VSUM is correct about-- such as file infector vs.
boot sector infector.  Viral payloads can sometimes be incorrect.

If there is technical information that "commoners" aren't interested in, and
it is known to be wrong, why not erase it?  The common people won't know the
difference and it'll help keep the rest of us off Ms. Hoffman's back.

>Hope you get my point,

I would understand your point if the incorrect info were just not included.
But I cannot understand the deliberate inclusion of inaccurate and/or
misleading information.

Subject: ??Hidden file: 386spart.par?? What is this? (PC)

I noticed this while playing solitaire on my PC (a 386).
Nothing else was running, and I noticed that my hard disk had
started doing something - I heard the noise it makes and saw
the light buzzing.

Since I found this unusual, I ran a virus check.  Found nothing.
Except there was a new hidden file - in the root directory - 386spart.par
I did a binary file edit but found mostly text and junk.  I couldn't
find anything that hinted at a virus hidden in this 10 megabyte
file.  I wonder if it may just be a dump from shutting off the
computer in haste and having some program backup what's on - but
why a hidden file in the root directory.

Any help would be appreciated.

Subject: Possible unknown virus (PC)

Hi, I am new to this group and have a couple of questions.

1. Where can I get a copy on the FAQ for viruses?

[Moderator's note: Anonymous FTP from cert.org (192.88.209.5) in
pub/virus-l.]

2. I recently installed DOS 6.0 and when I did my Nortin Anitvirus went off.
   It said I had Two files my Command.Com and Qbasic.exe file length had 
   been altered. I passed this off as the new version of DOS changing the
   file lengths, but when I talked too a guy at Microsoft he said that there
   where alot more files than that changed in the upgraded and told me he 
   had no clue. Could this be a virus

3. I went in and compressed my drive with DOS 6 and have started to have
   some wierd things happen.  Last night I went into Norton desktop and 
   noticed there were some of my file groups missing.  I ran norton Disk
   Doctor and It said one of my file alocation tables had been destroyed.
   Could a virus that I do not know about gone in and destroyed it?

4. Another thing I noticed was that when I commpressed my drive the last
   cluster on my harddrive was full and unmoveable.  I found this to be kind
   of weird because only a week before I had ran Speed Disk on my Harddrive
   and this cluster was empty. Dont some viruses rewrite the boot table and 
   put it there until they are ready to go off?

I guess my question really is, Is it possible I have an unknown virus.  Any  
help would be appreciated.

  I think that's silly. It will be infected. It will foil the attempts of
a few viruses that look for contiguous zero bytes (the stack space) to
implant themselves, but any overwriting or parasitic viruses (parasites 
are by far the most common file infectors) will still be able to infect it. 
it doesn't matter whether the infection is "internal" or "external", it's 
still an infection!
 
  I see things like this very often. People have an experience with one
particular virus, and find a way to stop it, or think up an idea that 
seems logical to them without really knowing anything about it, and they
think they're an instant expert on the subject.

  Well, there's my thoughts. It may stop a few (such as Lehigh). And a few
of the dumb viruses can be stopped using the Read-Only attribute. But it 
will not save you from the majority of the viruses.

Subject: Norton Antivirus question (PC)

Hi, I am new to this group so do you think someone could answer a few  
questions for me.  Where can I get a FAQ for this group. Sense I installed  
DOS 6.0 I have had three reprots of unknown viruses by Norton Antivirus 2.0  
The first came when I installed DOS and the other two a couple of weeks  
later.  Last night I went into Norton Desktop for the second time that day  
and a few things were different.  All of my file groups had been changed  
back to what they were origanlly when I installed the program.  Norton Disk  
Doctor said that one of my file alloction tables had been destroyed.  Could  
I have an unknown virus or is this just a problem with DOS 6.0 and windows  
existing on a commpessed drive?

Hello Vesselin,

You write:

The command still appears inside FDISK.EXE.  Running the MS-DOS 6.0
FDISK with the /MBR switch didn't give any error messages either.

Then again, it doesn't give any messages at all. :-)

Can someone enlighten me on the specifics of this virus.  How does it
spread, what does it do, how do I get rid of the thing?

On a more general note, can someone explain to me the general mechanism by
which a boot sector or FAT virus spreads?

Thanks...

Subject: New anti-virus (PC)

The new Integrity Master(tm) (V1.43) is now available.

                              What is it?
                              -----------

Easy to use, anti-virus and data integrity system.  You get a powerful
virus scanner combined with generic virus detection capability and
complete data integrity protection.  Do you have a virus?  An erratic
hard disk?  Did someone change a file while you were out?  Are software
conflicts damaging your files? Integrity Master answers all these
questions. Unlike most products, it will also detect files damaged but
not infected by a virus.  Integrity Master is available as ASP shareware
from many BBSes and shareware vendors.

(Integrity Master is the ONLY ASP product capable of scanning for viruses)

                              What's new?
                              -----------
Version 1.43 released April 16, 1993:

1) We've made virus naming corrections to adhere more closely to the CARO
   naming standard and reduced size of some text files.

2) IM identifies over 250 new viruses by name and characteristic
   including: the following viruses: Tiny128 2 minutes, A&A,ARCV1-9,
   Albanian, Alien, Barrotes, Beer, Benoit, BitAddict, Bubbles, CCCP,
   Chemnitz, Cinderella2, Costeau, Cpw, DIR3, DemoEXE, Demon,
   Diamond.620, EXEbug, Experiment, Explode, FichvE1, GotchaF, Grunt2,
   Interceptor, IntruderB, Joanna, Jos, Joshua, Kamikaze2, Kiwi,
   Kthulhu, L.Bro3, LPToff, Loki, Lovechild, Loz693, Luca, Lythyum,
   MD499, Malaise, Malign, Marauder, Mayak, Minimax, Ministry, Mix1b,
   Mr.Virus, NCU LI, Necropolis, Not586, Oxana, Pitch, PopooLar,
   Problem, Sandwich, Shadow, Shirley, SillyCR-178, Silly Willy, Silver
   Surfer, Skew, Stasi, Storm, Strange, SwissArmy, Tankard, Telecom3,
   Timemark, Todor, Tremor, Trvl Jack, Warrior, Wilbur, Wizard,
   Wolverine, X-2, X-1, Yeke.  IM now has improved algorithmic detection
   for viruses generated using the mutation engine (AKA mte or DAME) or
   with PS-MPC.  IM uses similar techniques to recognize Tremor and the
   V2P6 or V2P6z series of viruses.

3) You can now change directories by using the "/P" command line parameter.
   (e.g., "IM /P\DOS" /CR"  will check files in the \DOS subdirectory.)

4) You can now use the form "IM /Da:b:c:" to check disk a, b and then c.
   The older form of "IM /Dabc" is, of course, still supported for this.

5) We eliminated all remaining pauses in the screen display when you use
   the "/NE" command line parameter or if you have the "Halt" option set
   to "emergencies only".  This makes IM easier for sysops to run
   automatically to check uploads for viruses.

The following is a summary of enhancements since release of V1.41:

1) Integrity Master will now display dates in a variety of formats to
   suit national preference.

2) We've added the extended file/directory checks formerly found in only
   IM itself to IM's stand alone file checker (IMcheck) which now
   checks for corruption or suspicious values in the directory entries
   and supports IM's enhanced date format.

3) Integrity Master now supports the "/VM" command line option to scan
   multiple diskettes.

4) You now have greatly expanded control over your integrity data.
   Using SetupIM, you can ask IM to give these files the DOS read-only
   or hidden attributes and you have several new naming options
   including variably named files (each file will have a different
   unpredictable name). This makes it very difficult for someone to
   recognize your integrity data files if you keep them on your hard
   disk.

You can make sure you have a legitimate copy of Integrity Master by
checking the PKzip CRC values:

Here are the CRC values for the important files displayed by PKzip
(either 2.04 or older versions) for version 1.43c:

 Length  Method   Size  Ratio   Date    Time    CRC-32  Attr  Name
 ------  ------   ----- -----   ----    ----   -------- ----  ----
   2183  Implode   2151   2%  04-19-93  01:43  3da7f740 --w-  GENVIR.EXE

There's also an older version 1.43b which has some text revisions
relative to 1.43c:

 Length  Method   Size  Ratio   Date    Time    CRC-32  Attr  Name
 ------  ------   ----- -----   ----    ----   -------- ----  ----
