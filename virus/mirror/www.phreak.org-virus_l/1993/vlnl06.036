Wrong. In my country (Bulgaria), it is illegal to have a gun, unless
you are working for the police, army, etc.

You see, there are BIG differences between the local laws in the
different countries. You shouldn't assume that something is legal or
illegal (and should remain so) just because it is so in your
particular country. On the other side, computer viruses do not
recognize country boundaries...

True.  But if your gun goes off--either accidentally or intentionally--and
somebody else is injured, then you are legally responsible.  Could say the
same thing about viruses, I suppose...

It's definitively a false alarm, but it is difficult to tell whose
mistake it is exactly. One reason may be that the Thunderbyte TSR
(TbScanX?) keeps some unencrypted strings in memory. On the other
hand, why should F-Prot find the DataCrime II virus in memory at all??
If I recall correctly, DataCrime II is a non-resident virus...

 Has anyone written a program that will allow you to create a new
 partition table sector from scratch?

padgett@tccslr.dnet.mmc.com (A. Padgett Peterson):
 Well I have all of the pieces, just not ready for Prime Time...
   ..(important stuff deleted)..
 Thus the information can be found in not one but *four* different places
 on a DOS disk (Unix or Novell are different but the info is still there -
 just keep fresh batteries in your TI Programmer 8*).

 I imagine this was the type of situation chowes@sfu.ca (Charles
 Howes) had in mind in his original query.  Anyone got any other
 ideas?

- ------
Actually, I hadn't thought of it that way, but that describes it pretty well.

I'd like to see a program that will tell me what these four sources are
saying the hard disk should be, allow me to pick the one I think I picked
when I first partitioned my hard disk, and lay down a brand new set of
sectors.

I want to completely replace the four sources of information that may be
conflicting.  I want these sectors to look like they did the day after
I bought and formatted my hard disk.  And if the only damage to my hard
disk was those sectors, I want my FAT table and root directory to be
the same as they were the day before.

What does fdisk do?  I had hoped it replaced the entire sector that has the
MBR and partition table in it, and leave the rest alone, but that does not
seem to be the case.  Am I wrong?

Is format in charge of the DBR's?  Does sys diddle with it too?

One thing I can say for sure is that some versions of NDD ask you 'are you
having problems booting from your hard disk' and can't fix the "problem"
that they detect.

I've had similar experience to yours, except that it was not about a
single virus only... The final result was the same as in your case,
however... :-\}

There are two other alternatives. First, we are working on a browsing
program for the Computer Virus Catalog (of which MSDOSVIR is only a
part). The package, called CVBASE is available via anonymous ftp from
our site. It is a -very- preliminary version. We expect to release a
much improved version in the next few days, together with an updated
version of the Computer Virus Catalog (still hopelessly incomplete -
only 155 MS-DOS viruses are described, sigh...)

The second alternative is produced by ICSA and is called V-Base. A
demo version of it (supporting only the viruses with names beginning
with A, B, and C) is also available from our ftp site. It uses the
same format as VSUM, so one can use the same hypertext engine to view
it. It is still quite incomplete, and many of the entries bear the
brevity of the virus descriptions in F-Prot, but at least the
information is more exact than in VSUM.

> Too bad we can't get MSDOSVIR in hypertext format.

This might improve in the future...

   Yes, perhaps so. That's what I get for letting my fingers move faster
than my thoughts! :-) <I hate it when that happens>. But at the very least
a scanner *would* be able to tell the difference between Stoned at the
top of system RAM, and Stoned in the DOS buffer, and in that case *could*
inform you as to whether it's active or not. I realize this works only for
the viruses you know are capable of being in only one location to be
active, but I still don't feel satisfied when people continuously think
they are being nailed by Stoned, drive themselves crazy looking for it,
and the whole time it's only in the DOS disk buffer.

Subject: Re: EXE/COM switch (PC)

Hi netters.

Sometime ago I wrote a program that changes the executable filename's
extensios (EXE & COM) to another user-given extensions.

The idea was to see if file infector viruses could infect those files
too (those with the new extension).

I had to modify COMMAND.COM as well internally in order to allow it to
recognize the new extensions (eg EEE instead of EXE and CCC instead of
COM) and to be able to execute the files.  I tested 10 or more
different file infectors against the renamed files and all of them
were able to infect the files correctly.

You may say "Why did you change the file extensions?".  The program
would just be installed in computers used by "fool" users, that is,
people who doesn't even know what is a DIR command or what is a
directory name; users who just know some menu program that runs in the
autoexec.bat.  If they bring a new diskette from home with a funny
game, it will not run because the game has an EXE or COM extension,
which are not recognized by the modified COMMAND.COM.

Anyway, the experiment failed and the file infector viruses (DIR-II,
Dark Avenger, Lisbon (Vienna), Sunday and others) did infect the
files.

I think there's no way of fooling file infector viruses, is there?

Subject: Scanners and Compressed Disk Boot Sectors (PC)

Recently there has been some discussion concerning a problem with scanning
compressed drives for viruses and constantly getting a flag that the
"boot sector has changed".

Actually, this is an indication of a much more serious problem that A-V
producers should address immediately:

The problem indicates that the A-V product *thinks* it is checking the real
OS boot sector when in reality it is checking the swapped compressed drive
"boot sector". To me this means that a) the real boot sector is *not* being
checked, and b) the A-V is relying on DOS Interrust 25 to read the sector
rather than Interrupt 13 (or a direct BIOS call - better). The important
thing is that while DOS since the early 3's has provided a means to validate
/bypass Interrupt 13, there is no way to validate Interrupt 25.

With the rise of companion and stealth viruses, to be sure in checking the
low levels you must first authenticate the path to disk (it can be done even
from DOS), and then walk the boot procedure to make sure that there are no
"extra added attractions". This does not take any longer to do than using DOS
(in fact is probably a few cycles shorter) and eliminates a possible intrusion
path.

As a consequence, the fact that the A-V is checking the STACed drive boot
sector means more than just an error is being flagged each time, it would
make me concered that the real boot sector may be skipped.

						Warmly,

You should be able to repove Michelangelo with Clean with the following
from the command line.

CLEAN C:[MICH]

[Moderator's note: See the recent discussions on the potential
problems with using this command.]

Maybe you have a new variant of Michelangelo.

The reason the format didn't remove the virus is because viruses like
michelangelo and stoned hides in the partition table of the hard drive,
and Format never touches this area.

I think I chose the wrong word. By NEW I meant 'Viruses you don't
already have on your system'. I think we all agree that only heuristic
scanners are able to provide SOME means of protection against
completely new and unfamiliar viruses.

True, I did find out the Dir2 after it was known. Still - I scan EVERY

Subject: strange behaviour, may be a new virus... (PC)

Hi all !

I recently experienced thinks somewhat surprising. Sound like a virus
infection, more precisely : a boot and/or MBR virus infection.

Scenario:
Students regularely save their work on both HD and 3.5" disks. Since
January 8, 1993, floppy disk get unreadable after date were saved onto
them. No data error or tampering symptoms on HD. These disk corruptions
happened intermittenly. Norton Ut. or CP' DISKFIX got rid of this nasty
thing. At this point of the history, we all could think about material
trouble : this phenomena is reported on about 50 computers !

Considering this is a up to 2,000 people graduate school, each one of
them needs to compute every day, let's imagine how nervous is the
manager ! ...

Let's get back to serious things, now. None of the following AV tools
showed a known virus :

SCAN99
TBSCAN5.03
VIREX 2.6
F-PROT 2.06
CATCHMtE 1.9

No time-stamp file corruption.
No false defectives sectors
No CHKDSK interesting indications ( loss of RAM,...)
No more map MEM interesting info, showing an anormal TSR, for example..

When working this a clean-booted computer, everything seems to work
fine.

No file reproduction were noticed : on a clean-booted computer, I did a
complete CRC ( with TBSCAN 503 ) control on each executable file. After
having rebooted from the supposed infected HD, I ran some programs like
FORMAT.COM and others. Once more, I re-booted with a
clean-write-protected disk to ckeck out eventual CRC modifications :
none.

The only kind of viruses seems to be, IMHO, a BOOT virus and/or MBR
virus : no filesize modifications. Unfortunately, I could'nt run SYS C:
and FDISK /MBR to proof this.

Some viruses 'experts' (?) told the manager that the BR was copied on
sector 14. After ckecking this, no BR in there.

The only virus beginning to act on Janury 8th is 'TAIWAN'. Problem is
TAIWAN does *NOT* do that.

Any idea would be warmly appreciated, if any.

If all else fails, you can get the size of the disk from either
manufacturer's data or automatic detection in some BIOSes (like AMI)
or my freeware CMOS299 program. After you find that out, you can set
up the CMOS (again, my program or many modern BIOSes do a pretty good
job of setting up something reasonable when asked nicely).  Once you
get to that stage, FDISK can create a new set of partitions (loosing
everything) or something like Norton's Disk Doctor might be able to
sniff out whatever remains of the original partitions. If too much has
been written over there isn't a lot of hope, but somebody determined
enough (with the knowledge to look for clues like the fact that .. in
a subdirectory tells you where the parent directory, and therefore the
two copies of the FAT)

What can be useful is to know how to put a valid partition table on a
disk, without touching any other sector on the disk.  One way is to
copy one off another disk with a disk editor, another is something
like NDD that I mentioned before, another is a program which I can't
remember at the moment but is free and I could grab it if anyone needs
it. I have a feeling Padgett had one too, or was working on it?

That is not the entirely correct. There are other ways to detect new
viruses, these are what we call generic programs. However you are
right in the manner that PASSIVE scanning will detect only known
viruses, or possibly new ones with heuristic scanners only.

Yet there are programs that detects new viruses while attempting to
execute (such is IRIS's TSR module, and some optional McAfee's VSHIELD
functions, and there are others...) Our software for example, will
detect new viruses, and even eliminate them while they are completelly
unknown to the program.

All the best

That's complete nonsense.  PC Magazine looked again to the products they get
the most money for the slick ads they print, as usual.

Really? I wasn't aware of that. but then it's kinda hard to compare names
on hundreds of specimens.

The only reason that I brought this up is because recently a friend of
mine called wanting help with removing the green catepillar virus. I gave
him some info, and explained how to remove it.

he isn't exactly a rocket scientist, and two hours later he called back
saying that he had the 1575 virus. Jerry was paranoid, so I calmed him
down, and explained that 1575 and Green catepillar viruses were one and
the same.

I drove over and gave him a copy of Patricia Hohhman's VSUM, and showed
him that they really were the same virus.

I am sure there are other people like jerry that use two or more scanners,
and I believe standardizing the names would be the best thing scanner
authors could do for their users.

Getting off my soap box now. ;-)

FS> Actually, there is a *semi-official* naming standard...the CARO namin

I'm glad that scanner authors are using the CARO naming system.

Occasionally I run into new or modified soecimens. How can I send these
specimens directly to CARO? Up to now, I have be sending them to Glenn
Jordan, Wolfgang Siller. or yourself. I would like to be able to send
these specimens directly to CARO to cut down on the ammount of time to get
these to CARO.

Frisk:

My idea  will detect companion infectors. by the following means. using
the .* wildcard on .EXE files, and LHA A -A or PKZIP -wHS will add these
companion infectors regardless of what attributes they set.

I thought I explained this in the original message. Naybe I didn't
describe the process well enough. I said that I was no writer. ;-)

Thanks Frisk.

My idea is for the users that think "virus detection=scanning". This idea
would detect these new or modified viruses that a scanner would miss.
