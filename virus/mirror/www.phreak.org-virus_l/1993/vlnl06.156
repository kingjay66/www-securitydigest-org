Could somebody post the official English translation of the relevant
part of the Swedish legislation? It may be that you are interpreting
it incorrectly; recall the case with the Swiss legislation, which
didn't explicitely stated that malicious intent is required - and
people jumped on conclusions, just because they didn't know that this
is required by default.

Well, my ethical system seems to differ from yours, because I don't
agree even with the above. I am against *any* manifacturing,
distribution, or usage of destructive weapons. Yes, I know that
sometimes it is necessary. But this does not make it more ethical in
my eyes.

Yes, and the point is that those who writes viruses must *also* share
the responsability when/if his viruses are found somewhere where they
are not wanted.

Not always.

It's not as simple as that. If a responsible person makes a mess, s/he
will do their best to help cleaning up, regardless of whether failing
to do so has any legal implications or not. An irresponsible person
will do their best to avoid having to do anything with the mess they
have made, again regardless of the legal implications. Of course, if
the legal implications are severe enough, they might be forced to do
what a responsible person will do on their good will.

Actually, what *is* ridiculous is your way of reasoning and those of
the other virus writers like you, or of those to are helping for the
wide dissemination of viruses.

For instance, a responsible member of the society. Responsible members
of the society don't do things that the society in general considers
unethical.

The society, of course.

It certainly does, or more exactly with the lack of them.

This is fallacious. First of all, it is very difficult to prove a
negative - I thought that you know at least such elementary things.
Second, while it has yet to be proven that a virus cannot be
beneficial, it *has* been proved that a virus can be destructive.
Third, whether something is beneficial or not often has nothing to do
with ethics.

But all this is just useless logistics, because, from a practical
point of view, your arguments are completely flawed. Can you show me
*one* *real* beneficial virus? As opposed to that, many of the virus
that you have written can cause damage in several environments.

> Notice that I am refering just to the act of creating a virus.

As it has been observed severala time, this is OK, if nobody but the
creator sees it. However, we are talking here about those who write
viruses and post them on the virus exchange BBSes or publish them in
the underground virus writing magazines, where any malicious person
can get them and use them to cause damage.

OK, so enlighten us, tell us those million possible reasons. And
beware if they are only 999,999. :-)

Do you mean the computer virus called Anthrax? :-)

What we call *real* viruses - the things that you write - *are*
inherently destructive.

You are obviously not understanding the theory.

The problem that we, the people, have with the kind like you is that
you *do* release your work to be seen. If you wouldn't, everything
would be OK.

Obviously, most virus writers are not.

Big words. Have you read e.g., Kephart-White's epidemiological model
for virus spread? Do you understand it? If yes, prove it to us, by
posting a summary. If not, bug off and get to your school textbooks.

Oh, yes, and such models can be perfectly created by examining
simulations, instead of spreading a real virus in the wild. That's
what the computers are for - to be used for simulations of different
processes. And, in a simulation, you get much more control over the
process, and get all kinds of useful data that wouldn't be available
in a real experiment, and so on. Just create simulated viruses in a
simulated computer and nobody will say that you are doing something
wrong.

Again you are talking from US-centric positions. From own 30-year
experience, I can tell you that free speech and free writing can be
forbidden and that this can be enforced pretty effectively. :-(

Well, unlike you, I have a better oppinion of the human race. Besides,
statements like yours remind me very strongly of the words of some
German leader in the 30s...

Really? Well, FYI, Sweden seems to have banned virus writing,
Switzerland is about to follow, in the UK they are prosecuting the
virus writers pretty effectively... And nobody is calling those
countries "totalitarian". Except maybe a few virus writers... :-)

Even if it were so, it is not an excuse to write viruses. It cannot be
proven that cracking into other people's computers does not serve an
educational purpose too, yet hacking is a criminal offense in most
states of your country. All we want to do is to make virus writing and
distribution the same.

Two dimensional? They look pretty mono-dimensional to me - just a
string of bytes... :-) And the whole point is that the real viruses
*are* a piece of potentially destructive code, regardless of whether
they are also something else.

It depends on your definition of the term "virus". The drawback of the
above example is that it uses Internet; what it describes is pretty
impossible to inforce there.

However, consider the following example. A large network services
provider (something like CompuServe, but providing more services, like
ftp, telnet, and so on), owned by a company or government. They don't
want viruses on their network. To protect it, they have a policy that
each of their customers must be running the latest version of their
Super Duper ScanRes (a resident scanner) and scan all executed or
accessed executable objects. They have set their network in such a
way, that when the user requests to log in, the remote host instructs
the network driver of the local computer to check whether the latest
version of the mentioned anti-virus product is present and active. A
secure cryptographic protocol is used (e.g., public key encryption and
authentication). If no anti-virus program is found to be active, the
login is refused and the user is informed about the reason. If an
older version of the anti-virus program is found, the remote computer
offers to send a newer version. If the user refuses, login is refused.
If the user agrees, the newer version is sent to his/her computer
(again using a cryptographically secure protocol), the old one is
automatically replaced, and the user is offered to reboot (so that the
new version of the program gets activated).

Strictly speaking, the antivirus program, together with the software
for automatic update, is a virus (or more exactly - a worm). It
automatically spreads from the remote site to all machines that log
in. There are no ethical or legal problems involved, because the user
can always refuse the update and only the files belonging to the
"virus" itself are updated - no user files are touched. On the other
hand, the network services provider owns the network and has the full
right to state what software its customers must be running, in order
to access the network. Everybody who doesn't like it is free not to
use it and not to use the network services.

Of course, all this has nothing to do with the "real" viruses that are
written by some low-level form of dirth, who likes so much to brag
about its "rights of free speech".

Subject: anti-virus DOS -> UNIX (UNIX)

Hi there,

As I have read in the last FAQ, there are special cases for which scanning a
Unix system for DOS viruses makes sense (Unix server for PC systems w/ PC-NFS).

I am actually looking for a shareware/freeware product that could help me
with that so-called 'special case'.

The anti-virus should run on Sun machines (with SunOS 5.x or 4.1.x) and
detect/correct DOS viruses (or _eventually_ run on a PC and scan SUN disks).

Does anyone like to help ?

Thanks in advance,

Well, the guys at Thunderbyte consider more than *one* month a long time.
If they haven't released a new TBAV within about a month, they will at

Well, to get some more light on this:
* vsumx : there have been 'cpomplaints' from a lot of 'famous' people
          on virus-l about it not being up-to-date and correct.
          i made the assumption about mcafee scoring so well, because
          P. Hoffmann offers vsumx though mcafee.com
* nav2.1: the most recent version up to the test was 2.1
* test  : if a test appears in November, of course a product announced
          in September cannot be included anymore, as the release date
          of the magazine is the last week of September...

Two remarks: ok. they missed v3.0 bacause of the reason I mentioned.
             other products just could be included, or not, but nav
             gets a lower score because of this
             Second: I have seen a lot of bad reports on 3.0, so I
             *think* (NOT sure) that the results for 3.0 compared to
             2.1 will not be significantly better.

If you have any more proof to the contrary I think it will be very
good to post these to the net, eg. a list of improvements from 2.1
to 3.0

This will be 1) good for your users as they have more trust in you and
could try the new version and 2) it is good for the good name of your
company.

Another remark: I'll try to refrain from harsh judgements, but I did
not make the judgement you mentioned in ***1) it was the concluding
remark in the magazine.
Just to inform you some more.
>

I didn't make the judgement, although I tend to give TBAV and F-Prot
the better chances... But indeed they missed your 3.0 upgrade.

The "virus" John's friend has is called "DOS"; apparently, it is very
infective: you will find it on almost every PC... :-)

DOS has no genuine pipelining (such as, e.g. CMS Pipelines); all it has
is I/O re-directing. Whenever Command.com sees the pipline delimiter "|"
in a command line, it generates some auxiliary files, then it invokes
the pipeline stages, in turn, re-directing their standard I/O to the
auxiliary files, as appropriate. E.g., when you issue the "dir \*.* |
more"command, four auxiliary files will be created, two of which will be
seen by the Dir stage.

In a PC-DOS 3.30 system, these files are created in the root directory
of the current drive. Whenever the current drive is on a write-protected
disk, you will see the notorious message (on my system, it reads
"Schreibfehler Laufwerk A:", the wording on your system may vary :-) four
times for the four auxiliary files. The names of these files are derived
from the current system time. That can easily be demonstrated by the
following batch file:
    @echo off
    echo.| time
    dir 1*. | more
    echo.|time
(Note that no space is allowed between the dot and the bar after the
echo commands.) A test run showed that the time commands run at
16.31.59,18 h, and 16.32.00,34 h, respectively, and the two files
were named 101F3B23 and 101F3B28. Now read pairs of characters of these
file names as hexadekadic numbers, and you will get 16, 31, 59, 35 and
16, 31, 59, 40, respectively -- apparently the creation times of these
files.

In newer DOS versions, the names are formed according to a different rule
but still based on the system time; I am not sure about the directory
used for the files.

Oh no! Not again a low-level format!

Of course, the culprit, viz. Command.com, has not survived the low-level
format; it was re-installed via the format, or sys, command.

F-Prot 2.10 and yes, it should be able to remove it.

BTW, the virus is rather well known and many other anti-virus programs
should be able to deal with it too. If all else fails, use FDISK/MBR.

However, when Dr. Solomon's scanner says "identified", it usually
*does* mean it. There are very few exceptions. By "identified", it
means that every single bit of the virus is identified and it is
reasonably certain that it is exactly the variant it claims to be. (I
said "reasonably", instead of "absolutely", because a CRC of the
non-variable parts of the virus is used, instead of a bit-by-bit
comparison.) I have not tested this for NAV 3.0, but I got the
impression that this is not the case for it. Also, Dr. Solomon's
scanner *never* attempts to remove a virus it cannot identify. Not all
identified viruses are removable by it, though.

However, there might be a bug in the removal routine, or the user
might be infected by more than one virus, or something else. To check
the first case, I did a test of the removal capabilities of several
anti-virus scanners for all known variants of this virus. Here are the
results.

Notes:

1) "Detects" means "detects the virus but nothing more". "Repairs"
means "repairs the virus *correctly*". "Deletes" means "detects the
virus and deletes the infected file". "Renames" means "detects the
virus and renames the infected file, without disinfecting it".
"Misses" means "does not detect a virus in the file". "Damages" means
"detects a virus and attempts to repair the file, but actually damages
it". "Goofs" means "repairs the entry point of the file correctly, but
doesn't cut the whole virus, potentially allowing the resulting file
to cause a false positive". "DetectsR" means "detects the virus in the
files, but can repair only the COM files".

2) Version 6.51 of FindVirus was used. I don't know which is the
respective version of Dr. Solomon's Anti-Virus Toolkit that contains
this version of the scanner.

3) FindVirus said "like" about the 690-byte variant and "identified"
about all the rest.

4) NAV 2.1 is with the November updates of the virus definitions - the
ones that you sent me and that are on our ftp site. The same goes for
NAV 3.0.

Having in mind that you wrote the above in November, I would bet that

getting it (the update) for distribution on our ftp site?

The VirStop that comes with the commercial (professional) version
will. It would be really nice if this could be included in the
shareware version too. However, this particular feature has been
developped not by Frisk, but by his Finnish distributor (Data

I'm not sure that I understand your question. VirStop is a resident
scanner, and as such it raises an alert when and infected object is
accessed or about to be executed. Windows probably "steals" control
from it, or just prevents the alerts from being displayed, but when
you exit from Windows, everything should be as before.

When you use pipes (the '|' character), DOS automatically creates two
temporary files with unique names for each pipe. Theoretically, only
one should be sufficient; dunno why DOS needs two. They are created by
the command interpreter (usually COMMAND.COM) when it parses the
command line and *before* the first command of the pipe (DIR in your
case) is executed. The files are deleted after the pipe terminates.
That's why the files are present in the directory listing observed by
MORE, but not in a normal directory listing.

Relax, it's not a virus. It's normal.

First, it has "remained", because DOS has remained (or more exactly -
has been re-installed). Second, there has been no virus in the first
place. Third, the above action is a typical example of the damage a
panicked and ignorant user can do. The moral of the story is: If you
suspect a virus infection and don't know how to deal with it, consult
somebody more competent than you. And, before evrything, DON'T PANIC!

Unless, of course, you remove the ReadOnly attribute. For instance,

Yes, it isn't one. :-) Or, more exactly, it is called COMMAND.COM.

Well, I told you as soon as I read your message. The moderation of

This was a problem in F-Prot below 2.10. I didn't know that it also

Depends on how fast your computer and hard disk is. I would say -
noticeable, but not very annoying. (But, hey, I am using a 486!) The
biggest delay is when you press Alt-Ctrl-Del, because then the program
has to reset the drive, try to read the boot sector from the floppy in
it, and wait for the timeout if there's no floppy there at all.

The reason is that VirStop 2.10 is not able to detect this virus.
F-Prot is, but only when run in "Secure scan" mode (the default). An
easy way to check whether VirStop is able to detect a particular virus
is to run F-Prot in "Quick scan" mode and check whether in this mode
the program detects the virus. VirStop uses the same scanning engine
as F-Prot's Quick Scan.

To all who replied to my post, thank you all.

After having cost the net hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars only
to discover that it was *not* a virus at all, I have referred my
friend to the time-honored First Solution, RTFM. :) I, on the other
hand will plead ignorance to any charges that *I* should have done the
same. ( I just *love* hypocrisy, it's sooooo guilt-free!)

I can't seem to find any "man" pages on this thing! (Whaddaya mean
there's no manual entry for @$&^*$! ?)

I only got my first "real" home computer 3 months ago and it will not
produce those temporary files no matter what I do with DIR or MORE,
perhaps because it came with DOS 6 installed and was upgraded (?) to
DOS 6.2 before Martin approached me with his problem. (Until I bought
this 486, I used a decrepit PC-Convertible with one functional floppy
and no HD as a terminal only to modem to Kent State where I did all my
computing on our UNIX machines.)

Anyway, thanks Jimmy Kuo, Iolo Davidson, and Otto Stolz for your
informative and (in your case, Otto ) humorous replies. Maybe DOS
itself *is* a virus.  Can we add a corollary to the old adage and say
that any sufficiently advanced virus is indistinguishable from a
feature?

Well, there go another few hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars.

Thanks again,
John

P.S. The guy *still* doesn't believe it's not a virus! ( You can spend

As far as I recall the NT loader is a system file named NTLDR.SYS, or
similar.  You don't damage it, unless you delete it. You say you know
how to remove the Form boot infector from a system running DOS and
Windows NT 3.1.  I think it would be a god idea to share this
information with the rest of us.

I assume you have booted from a DOS system disk and executed the
command SYS C:

This WILL remove the virus, BUT it will also result in the misfeature
of not having the Windows NT loader executed at boot-time. Your system
will either hang or boot DOS.

I do not have access to any machines where Windows NT is installed, at
the moment.  So, all this is faint memories of the past summer.

The MS-DOS operating system have a DOS Boot Sector (DBR) containing
code, that among other tasks, loads and executes the file IO.SYS from
the active partition (usually drive c:).  PC-DOS and DR-DOS also loads
such a file, but they use the name IBMBIO.COM, instead of IO.SYS.
This is the first file executed during a boot with DOS, and IO.SYS
takes control after the DBR, then handles other files like MSDOS.SYS
(IBMDOS.COM on PC-DOS and DR-DOS), DBLSPACE.BIN (on MS-DOS 6.x), and
the different statements in the CONFIG.SYS.

Windows NT is different, but the boot is quite similar. Its boot
sector also loads a file, but with a different name from that of the
different DOS versions. If my memory serves me right, the name is
NTLDR.SYS. When you boot the MBR will load the DOS Boot Sector, or
System Boot Sector as it might be called when not talking about DOS,
and the System Boot Sector will load and execute the NTLDR.SYS file
which displays the Flexboot menu.

Running SYS C: from a DOS system disk will result in a loss of the NT
Boot Sector, and a DOS Boot Sector will be inserted instead. The
NTLDR.SYS file will never get loaded, and instead the DBR will try to
load and execute the file IO.SYS or IBMBIO.COM.

Possible solutions:

1) Boot from a DOS system disk and do a DIR C:\ /AS it will display
the system files. One of the system files should be ca. 120KB in size,
and have a name similar to NTLDR.SYS. Then use a disk editor (e.g.,
Norton Disk Editor or NU.EXE) to replace the IO.SYS or IBMBIO.COM
filename, with the NTLDR filename. I have NOT tried this, and can not
promiss that it will work, but it is worth a try if nobody else comes
up with a better solution.

2) Wait until I can get my hands on a machine that runs NT and DOS. I
will then probably write a small utilitity to fix this problem. At
least I will come up with a tested solution.

To prevent this from happening again:

1) Use my anti boot virus program, HS v3.5. It should detect and
remove such a virus if you install it on a computer BEFORE it gets
infected by a bootinfector. You should also make a DOS system disk
with a copy of the MBR and DBR or SBR. The floppy should also contain
a utility that is able to write the copies of the bootsectors to the
harddisk. HS v3.5 is, among other things, such a program.

2) Use another anti boot virus program, like Padgett's DiskSecure II.

IMHO, the current antivirus packages are not very strong when it comes
to boot infectors.  The same goes for the build-in antivirus code of
most BIOS'es I've seen.

Why do you think this is a virus? Have any antivirus software indicated that this
may be a virus? Have you ever heard of the term "Panic"? :-)
You should give some information about what version of DOS your friend have
problems with, and what kind of computer it is, etc.

Most likely this is NOT a virus. DOS have been known to make two files with random
file names when you use the MORE command. Using MORE with DIR or another command
that displays the directory where DOS puts those two files will often result in the
"discovery" of those two files.

In more recent versions of DOS you can specify where such files should be put.
This is done by setting the environment variable TEMP.

Make a directory C:\TEMP and put the following in your AUTOEXEC.BAT:

SET TEMP=C:\TEMP

Now those two files should only appear in the TEMP directory, and not in the current
directory. To verify that this is working, do the following:

C:
CD \
DIR /O-D /A | more                      ; Works with DOS 5 and greater
CD \TEMP
DIR /O-D /A | more

The first dir command should NOT display the two mentioned files.
While the second dir command should display two such files, as the two
first entries in the listing.  The filenames will be different all the
time, and it is not possible to make two files with the same filename.
The files are deleted when the MORE command has completed, and you are
returned to the command line. Also the size of the files, as displayed
by DIR , are usually zero bytes.  (A virus usually needs a bit more to
infect :-)).

If your friend is using an old version of DOS (the current version is
6.20) the TEMP vari able may not be supported, and he should leave the
system as is. If there are other reasons to

suspect a virus infection on your friends system, I would suggest that
he scans his hardd isk with e.g., FSI's F-Prot 2.10 or McAfee's Scan
109.

>Does anyone know anything about this virus?

It is called DOS and it is quite widespread  :-)

You should probably read the FAQ for this newsgroup.
And maybe also Robert Slades panic guide.

Can any tell me about the reaper virus? Center Point Anti-Virus software does

This is definitively NOT a virus.

What happened is the following: When you use the pipe (="|") operator
on the command line, DOS (better: COMMAND.COM) creates two temporary
files - named as you write - in the directory pointed to by the TEMP
environment variable, or - if TEMP is not defined - in the current
directory.
- - This is what you've been experiencing.

Suggestion: Create a directory c:\tmp and put "SET TEMP=C:\TMP" in
            your autoexec.bat.

  most people yell "Virus!" ]

Well, Microsoft programs often exhibit strange behaviour, but I dare say
that THIS will NEVER happen.

THIS IS - IN THEORY! - NOT POSSIBLE.
(If you did boot and format from a clean disk, of course.)

    I'm quite sure that you'll find a similar answer from Bontchev
    at least. :-))

Subject: New (?) variant of Stoned virus (PC)

F-PROT 2.10 reports that it has found a new variant of the Stoned virus
on one my PC's. It does not try to disinfect it.

Mcaffee SCAN 109 does not see any infection at all.

After manually repairing the partition table, and reformatting the
hard disk, F-PROT still reports the infection.

Before I low-level format the drive, is this really something new that
anti-virus authors want to see? Shouldn't SCAN 109 find something?
If anyone has any interest in this let me know, the drive gets
low-leveled Monday (12/6/93) afternoon.

Subject: Using A-V software to remove vir (PC)

I keep telling people that A-V software is good, but cleaning viruses from
files should only be  used as a last resort.

It is always best to delete the infected files, and restore the uninfected
files from backup or original diskettes.

Last month, one of my clients (Ms. L. Cain) contacted me and reported that
her hard drive was no longer bootable, and after she booted from the clean
bootable diskette I had prepared, most of the files no longer run.

When I asked what had happened, she reported that she had used A-V software
to clean the Green Catepillar (1575 according to Mcafee's scan) virus.

However this was a modified variant of Green catepillar, and her A-V software
hadn't recognized that the virus was larger that 1591 bytes, so the A-V
software corrupted the files suring the cleaning process.

I drove over, and spent several hours cleaning up the mess that the A-V
software had made.

Everyone has two good sources to prevent this type of mess from happening to
you.

1. Write protected originals
2. A recent backup. I would suggesr at least two complete backups.

If you find that you have some infected files, delete them, then restore the
files from original diskettes, or backup.
