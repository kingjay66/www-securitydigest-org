VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a gatewayed and non-digested USENET
counterpart.  Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software
platform - diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant,
concise, polite, etc.  (The complete set of posting guidelines is
available by FTP on CERT.org or upon request.)  Please sign submissions
with your real name; anonymous postings will not be accepted.
Information on accessing anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue
archives is distributed periodically on the list.  A FAQ (Frequently
Asked Questions) document and all of the back-issues are available by
anonymous FTP on CERT.org (192.88.209.5).

Administrative mail (e.g., comments, suggestions, beer recipes)
should be sent to me at: krvw@ASSIST.IMS.DISA.MIL.

All submissions should be sent to: VIRUS-L@Lehigh.edu.

Introduction to the Anti-viral archives	listing of 01 August 1993

This posting is the introduction to the "official" anti-viral archives
of VIRUS-L/comp.virus.  With the generous cooperation of many sites
throughout the world, we are attempting to make available to all
the most recent news and programs for dealing with the virus problem.
Currently we have sites for Amiga, Apple II, Atari ST, IBMPC, Macintosh
and Unix computers, as well as sites carrying research papers and
reports of general interest.  Updates to these lists are made exclusively
by contributions provided by the readers of this group.  My thanks go
out to the many people who keep this information current.

If you have general questions regarding the archives, you can send
them to this list or to me.  I'll do my best to help.  If you have a
submission for the archives, you can send it to me or to one of the
persons in charge of the relevant sites.

If you have any corrections to the lists, please let me know.

The files contained on the participating archive sites are provided freely
on an as-is basis.

To the best of our knowledge, all files contained in the archives are either
Public Domain, Freely Redistributable, or Shareware.  If you know of one
that is not, please drop us a line and let us know.  Reports of corrupt
files are also welcome.

PLEASE NOTE
The Managers of these systems, and the Maintainers of the archives, CAN NOT
and DO NOT guarantee any of these applications for any purpose.  All possible
precautions have been taken to assure you of a safe repository of useful
tools.

Archive access without anonymous ftp	last changed 11 July 1992

To get files from the anti-viral archives, you do not need access
to anonymous ftp.  (However, anonymous ftp is generally the preferred
method.)  Below is information on accessing the archive sites using
only email.

                           -=-

The AppleII, Atari ST and IBMPC archives have mail servers which
provide access to their archives.  You may receive automatic updates
of Macintosh anti-viral programs via email.  See the individual articles
on these sites.

                           -=-

One way to get access to the archives is through the BITFTP server
at Princeton.  Send a message to the BITNET address is BITFTP@PUCC
with the body of the message containing the single word HELP.  This
should get you more information, and give you access to any archive
site on the Internet.  Due to excessive loads, this service has been
restricted to BITNET and EARN sites only.  UUCP sites need not apply.

                           -=-

In response to Princeton closing its service to non-BITNET sites,
Digital has made an FTPmail service available.  Send mail to
FTPmail@decwrl.dec.com with the body of the message containing
the word 'help'.  Another site offering this service in Australia
can be reached at the address FTPmail@cs.uow.edu.au.

                           -=-

You may also retrieve files from the SIMTEL-20 and the INFO-MAC
archives by using one of the many mail servers which maintain
a shadow archive of these sites.  Send the following message to one
of the listserv sites.

help

See the IBMPC and Macintosh articles for a complete list of servers.
