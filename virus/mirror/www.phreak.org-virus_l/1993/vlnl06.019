Hm, most software is "acting on its own"; I'm afraid that this needs a

But there are hundreds of viruses that are extremely stupid and do not
try to hide at all... Should we classify them as non-viruses?

Hm, I see several problems with this definition:

1) As Dr. Cohen pointed out, "instructions" is not an appropriate
term. Use "symbols" instead.

2) After "certain conditions" I would add " or in a certain
environment".

3) Don't like the term "functional duplicate". As you explain further
in your message, you mean "a copy that might not look the same as the
original, but which does the same things". What if it doesn't do the
same things? I would argue that it is possible to make it do more
things and it is obvious that it is trivial to make it fewer things...
That's why I would prefer the term "possibly evolved copy" instead of
"functional duplicate".

4) What is "intercept program execution"? The non-resident viruses do
not intercept anything; they get executed only when the user runs the
infected program.

5) Don't like the term "executed". What about source files, macros,
BASIC programs? I would use the term "interpreted" or at least
"executed or interpreted" instead.

6) Since the virus may or may not return control to the original
infected program, is it worth the effort to include this in the
definition? Regardless whether it returns control to the program, it
will be a virus, if it matches the other parts of the definition.

So, let's try again:

"A computer virus is a sequence of symbols which, when interpreted
under certain conditions in certain environments, will make a possibly
evolved copy of itself. This is called `replication' and the copy
retains at least the capability to recursively replicate further."

Hm, still doesn't sound perfect to me, but I'll leave to the others to
improve it. And, according to it, DISKCOPY is still a virus...

I strongly doubt that... :-)

Subject: Viruses and Worms

IMHHO we seem to be going through some of the throes of an identity crisis
with many partial discussions of "What is a virus ?" and "Is a worm a
virus ?". This needs to be settled.

First, my opinion needs to be stated: A worm is not a virus. This is a
matter of definition and proofs can be generated either way depending
on definition.

True, both propagate but in different ways: a worm is a stand-alone,
complete in itself and needing only to ensure regular scheduling using
available common resources found within a computing environment. The
processes a worm creates are also separate and distinct entities within
that environment. Resources (e.g. compiler, linker) may need to
be invoked to produce those entities, but will not be altered by it.

In counterpoint, a virus is a parasitic process: at some stage it involves
the replacement of part or all of a pre-existing or newly generated or
potential process with itself. In other words, the scheduling or potential
for scheduling must already exist (e.g. like AUTOEXEC.BAT: nothing will be
wrong if not there but the OS *was designed* to look for it & if found, will
execute). No new scheduling was necessary.

Bill was correct that the means for scheduling is the key - a worm creates
its own schedule for execution, a virus must use an existing one through
replacement - a virus cannot schedule itself, it must have help. This IMHO is
the fundamental difference and an important one since it is essential in
drawing the envelope.

This resolves the question of MBR and BSI infections: the BIOS is programmed
to examine this area and, if certain criteria are met, to execute what is
found there - a pre-existing schedule for execution. Clearly, propagating
code in this area would be a virus and not a worm.

On the other hand, a process which copies itself onto a disk and modifies
AUTOEXEC.BAT to execute it through a simple append operation would be a worm:
nothing was *replaced*. On the other hand, if AUTOEXEC.BAT were renamed A.BAT
and replaced with the malicious code as AUTOEXEC.BAT and the final line
called A.BAT, this would be a virus - replacement occured.

In simplest terms, a worm propagates through *addition* a virus propagates
though *replacement* (though it may reschedule the original to avoid
detection).

Perhaps CRC is a poor choice of acronym since it has an explicit
meaning (but I was replying to another posting). "Checksum" is
probably better since we have been talking about computational means.
"Algorithmicly Generated Signature" (AGS) is even more appropriate. My
point was that *any* mechanism that is reasonably robust and which
will generate a well distributed scatter of values is sufficient. In
fact, the more the merrier.

Did I mention *legal* action ?  No...I said just "any action"....this can
take several different forms, depending on who the virus author is - calling
his parents and asking them if they have any liability insurance might be
effective in some cases.  Publishing the names of the author might work
too. In some cases legal action may be the only way....but I am not saying
it is necessary in all cases.

Well, there are several ways to spot writing to the disk port directly.
Obviously, software-only methods would be limited in speed, which means
it is a good idea to have a dedicated machine for testing programs for
viruses (and compatibility) as they come into an organisation.

The methods are:

(1) Use a PC emulator (you can get the equivalent of about 6MHz easily on
    a Sparc, and the freeware program "pcm" looks promising in the long
    term - it already gives good diagnostics about port I/O).
(2) Use a Data General DG10 - old technology, but the 2nd processor traps all
    port I-O from the 8086 and can warn about naughty programs.
(3) Alarms attached to the write line of the disk cable (and variations on
    the theme, such as special disk controller cards).  These are about the
    best answer I guess - no impact on speed or compatibility, and catches
    everything because it can be impossible for viruses to detect.  There
    are a few drawbacks (most of which have been discussed before, but I'm
    happy to chat about them via e-mail).
(4) Software solutions based on the 386 facilities.
(5) Software solutions based on interrupts.
(6) Software solutions based on making the physical disk layout obscure,
    e.g. encryption, strange head/sector numbers, compression algorithms,
    non-FAT systems in general.   But you might get a corrupted disk, rather
    than working - but infected - programs.
(7) Detection of viruses because they are much larger - having to carry around
    with them the extra code to access a variety of disk types and partitioning
    schemes.  The bigger the virus, the easier to detect (in general).  The
    days when everyone used IBM-compatible MFM drives with DOS 3 partitions
    have long gone.  My system, for example, uses IDE and SCSI drives, DM and
    DRDOS partitions, and sometimes SuperStore.

Overall, I prefer viruses that do something out of the ordinary, like trying to
write to disk ports, since they become easy to distinguish from valid software.
The big problem with viruses on PC's, at least, at the moment is that there is
a large fuzzy area filled with programs (like Norton's DS and self-modifying
executables) that bypass DOS in the same way that viruses do - you have to
individually look at what they are doing and decide whether that is okay. There
are a few "clever" tricks like direct disk access that I genuinely hope virus
writers will adopt - in place of yet-another-stoned-hack and so on, and I think
that naming schemes which give too much glory to authors of slightly-changed
viruses should be changed to reflect that fact it is just another hack of
somebody else's idea. Even if string-scanners weren't being overtaken by virus
technology, the sheer nuisance factor of hundreds of slightly new viruses is
worth discouraging. (Hopefully this will generate some interesting discussion!)

No.  Not unless you are running one *strange* ANSI driver.  The
"ANSI.SYS" driver that comes with DOS intercepts a number of control
codes when they are printed to the screen.  Some of these control
codes move the cursor, some delete characters and lines on the screen,
and some change the text or background colour.  One of these codes
redefines keystrokes, much like any keystroke-based macro package.

For example, by sending a special set of characters to the screen, one
could redefine the "i" key to simulate the keystrokes "^[DEL *.*^MY^M"
where "^[" is the Escape key and "^M" is the Enter key.  When the user
started to ask for a directory, the ANSI driver would intercept the
"i" key and "expand" it into an Escape (to cancel the current input),
a delete command, and confirmation for the delete command.

If I embed this special ANSI character sequence (the one to redefine
the key in the first place) in a text file, I can plant a primitive
sort of logic bomb in the form of a dangerous macro.  There is no ANSI
character sequence to get the ANSI driver to create or run a malicious
program however (other than what is already possible through keystroke
macros).

In theory, one *might* be able to have a key macro create a kind of
virus on-the-fly, but I can't see that being a particularly successful
sort of virus.

Well, anybody who has the PUTAV program that comes with the registered

A signature has three components - the number ("NWN405"), the company
name ("Zip Source: McAFEE ASOCIATES"), and the text that appears at
the end of the archive listing (normally put in the file AVEXTRA.TXT).
In your sample it seems that only the third part has been broken.

But it doesn't matter, because the authentication algorithm used by
PKWare -is- insecure and can be broken very easily. So, your warning
is correct - DON'T TRUST PKWARE'S -AV CODES - EVEN THOSE IN VERSION 2.

People who want -real- authentication of their archives, should look
at the archiver HPACK, available from garbo.uwasa.fi. It provides
public-key encryption and authentication, and is compatible with the
public keys used by the public key encryption program PGP.

And PGP refuses to recognize that the message contains a PGP block...
Of course, if you remove the "- " in front of each line, the resulting

Subject: Anybody knows the new address of Muttik I.G.?(Virus investigator)

I had just read an old article in virus-l about the virus Starship.
This article was written by Muttik I.G., its old internet address was
'MIG@politon.msk.su', but the node had disappear. I think he is a
researcher in Moscow, in the actu al Comunity of Independent States
(RUSIA).
     If anybody have information about him please contact me at:
