There has been a number of postings concering obtaining accurrate
information about PC viruses. Although not available by ftp (yes
you will have to put your hand in your pocket :-) I've found the
following to be most helpful.



Solomon, A. 1991    "PC Viruses. Detection, Analysis and Cure".
Springer-Verlag. London.

This book deals with around a hundred or so of the most common PC
viruses and has a number of interesting technical observations. Well
worth a read.


Solomon, A. 1992    "Dr Solomon's Virus Encyclopaedia". S & S
International Ltd. 2nd edition.


The Encyclopaedia comes with the Anti-Virus Toolkit. I do not know if
it can be purchased separately. It covers a large number of viruses
including many obscure ones. The opening pages also include an
excelent description on Stealth techniques.

Subject: Re: Viruses and Canada

	I'll try an clear up a few queries, arising from responses to the
previous posting.  
	At this point in time, we as a university have experienced Stoned,
Noint, Manitoba and something which F-Prot 207 suggests is a Stoned variant,
and Scanv102 calls stoned.  
	On scanning numerous student/faculty floppy disks we have noticed
that the disks which had system files on them, have the files no longer
hidden.  On getting information on the disk, via in this case Virus
Busters Doctor program, the disk label(always garbage), O.E.M IBM 3.3,
followed by the id is displayed.     
	The 'stoned variant' which I refer to above, is called Manitoba by
Virus Buster 3.95, but with 3.94 this was not the case.  The main
differences(for us) between these two releases was that the program could
now remove 'Manitoba' from floppy disks.
	I've received comment from one of the writers of Untouchable, and
have forwarded additional testing information, however I'm still
re-assessing the untouchable software; however the original testing resulted
in the previous posting.
	To summarise, Untouchable 1.13 allowed us to restore from the safe
diskette after boot infection, on being infected with an unknown boot
infection the res part of the packages(UT and S&D) flagged a different in
available memory, 2K, since in the defining of the system original 640K was
listed, now 638 is available.  However no virus was detected, but suggestions
were made of a possible infection. 
	As far as the form infection which was mentioned, the diskette in
question had been shipped from Germany, and the student was complaining of
'errors' on the disk.  On using f-prot the disk had Manitoba and form was
revealed as well.  On examining the disk attempting to restore the users
'critical' information, less and less of the disks contents were becoming
available to us, with each attempt.  However perchance the disk has a great
deal of physical damage, originally all but a few files were accessible to
the student via ordinary dos means.. such as type or indeed by using a
wordprocessor.  However again on repeated calls of the same file(s) more
data errors were flagged ending in general failures which resulted in the
disk being checked with Norton.  
	On the untouchable theme, the copy we were supplied with for
evaluation, came as three seperate items, each of which we installed fully.
Untouchable 1.13, Search and Destroy, Untouchable NLM.  
	I hope this goes some way to making the original post clearer.

There is a reply, of sorts, because there is a not insignificant difference
between a password (or other "what you know" authentication schemes) and a 
smart-card (and "what you have" authentication.)  Only one person can be 
in possession of a smart-card at a given moment - many people can be in 
possession of a password simultaneously.  Users cannot tell if their password 
has been compromised, but they can determine whether or not they're still in
possession of their token.

as someone who does study this, i am sorry to have to agree with you.
the organization of the 'bad guys' is really extraordinary considering

but wait!! this does not necessarily mean they came from that bbs,
of course. i have viruses sent to me from all over the world that
have the names of anti-virus companies, anti-virus researchers, even
my OWN name...this does not mean they originated here. why, i even
have seen them from the VTC at Hamburg...i.e., when they are
unzipped, they say 'Virus Test Center, University of Hamburg' in
the A-V marking!

of course, viruses did come from that bbs in sofia. its fortunate
that bbs is no longer in operation; and unfortunate that many more
have taken its place, mainly in the USA....and no one seems to
care....

Subject: V-Sign? (PC)

A computer in a public cluster here turned up with what f-prot called
"V-Sign". It said it infected the boot sectors of each of the drives
(c,d,e,f) and listed garbage as the name for one of them. Has anyone
heard of this virus? There is no mention of it in the listing that comes
with f-prot. The version of f-prot was current -- 2/93. They had to do a
hardware reformat of the disk - *three times* - could this thing have
stuck around and diverted a format? Anything out there that could get
rid of it??

sywu@csie.nctu.edu.tw (Xianyow ) writes:

>    I have a question, can a virus infect NOVELL system? 

Yes, of course. And it even happens relatively often. Mainly due to
sloppy LAN security.

Theoretically, it can't. However, what does exactly mean "read-only"?
A file with the ReadOnly -attribute- set? A virus could easily remove
this attribute, if the Modify -right- is granted to this file. Or do
you mean a file that does not have the Read -right- granted? Granted
to whom? If -you- do not have the right to write to this file, some
other user might have it. And this user's workstation might be
infected... Or even the supervisor's workstation might be infected -
it happens... And the supervisor is able to write to any file...

Similarly, it is possible to bypass the ExecuteOnly attribute by using
a companion virus, as described in Dr. Cohen's paper in the
proceedings of the 2nd Virus Bulletin conference. The paper describes
in details his experiments on how protection works (and how it
doesn't) on Novell NetWare and Unix file servers. Unfortunately, he
has used NetWare 3.11 in his experiments. This is a version we don't
have here, so we were unable to repeat the experiments. We did some
similar experiments on NetWare 2.15c, but found nothing exceptional,
except that if you establish a sloppy combination of rights and
attributes, a virus will be able to infect the files.

> If it can't
> , how can it live when the power turned off?

:-). It "lives" in the infected files. Whenever you execute one of
them, the virus becomes active. If it is a memory resident one, this
means that it installs itself in the memory of the workstation that
has executed the infected file.

>    But I really heard some viruses can infect NOVELL.  Can anyone answer me?

Yes, many of the existing viruses do - if the protection settings
allow (or do not forbid) them to do so and if the viruses are written
well enough. There are also a few NetWare-aware viruses that steal
passwords.

You didn't specify it to be shareware, did you? OK, there is a
commercial product that does that - it is called Untouchable and is
marketed in the USA by Fifth Generation Systems.

Actually, there are many other products that use only a single
database of checksums - NAV, SCAN, Sentry, Dr. Solomon's AVTK, etc., 
but since you also wanted it to be secure...

I don't solicit for such material.  If it happens my way and tells me
what is 'popular' with the virus writers, I am quite happy to take this
as a hint to what I should be doing in response.

Viruses are going to remain a problem for the forseeable future.  So
the publicity and 'glamour' associated with producing will assure they
continued production.  Maintaining 'virus scanners' is expensive in time
and labour,


> Tell me, where do YOU get 40-Hex from?

Generally other researchers say "the new issue of 40-hex includes a new
virus/advocates method X of attacking a-v products" and pass me a copy.
I can then revise my a-v tools to ensure that I can help my clients when
these viruses are spread.

> Why should it be ok for you to receive it, but not me?

40-hex is basically an incitement to write and distribute viruses, with
hex dumps and disassemblies, and a few words of editorial encouragement.
As such it is quite dangerous, a barely competent PC user could follow
the published instructions to obtain an active virus.  I wouldn't sell
a gun/car/tank of acid to someone unless I am persauded they are
competent to own/handle it.  Similarly I will not pass something as
damaging as a virus unless you persaude me that you are competent to
handle, store and keep it safe.  I should mention that I take a lot of
persauding.

This is utterly wrong, there is no need to "get my hands dirty".  If I
obtain useful insight into virus writers current objectives it is
curteous of me to alert other virus researchers.  In the case of 40-hex
it is simplest to forward the whole publication.

It is not for your good, but mine.  It is unethical for me to pass such
material to someone who might use it malicously, or is likely to have
an 'accident' because they are not competent to take adequate safeguards.

It's not censorship, but trust.

I work hard to earn the trust of my clients, and other researchers.
I intend to keep that trust by behaving ethically, and being exceedingly
cautious in providing viruses to other people.

I think you're suffering from a summer cold, you did say cylinder 7!

If Cyl 7 Side 0 Sectors 16, 17 are the physical address, on a 1.44Mb floppy
these translate to 'absolute' DOS sectors 267 & 268, (clusters 236 & 237).
Quite a long way from the FAT.

Hope you don't feel too foolish.  Good luck with Legal Net Monthly, the
first issue certainly looks promising.

By a natural way to write to the disk I mean - using the DOS file
system. After all, all DOS manuals are telling you that this is the
way to write to the disk. Internally DOS translates this to INT 13h
requests. You could also use INT 26h (which is also translated to INT
13h requests by DOS, but DOS never uses INT 26h itself), or even INT
13h yourself, but this is already considered "dangerous" by any kind
of resident interrupt monitoring program I have ever seen. The only
programs that usually go that low are the programs from the Norton
Utilities and the similar packages - disk organizers, directory
sorters, disk editors. Oh, yes, and CHKDSK uses INT 26h too - when it
needs to fix the FAT(s).

Regarding the DMA, the abbreviation stands for Direct Memory Access
and, as the name suggests, is used to access the memory in a fast way
(bypassing the CPU) - not the disk. Of course, it is possible to do
very fast disk transfer by controlling the disk via the ports and
initializing DMA transfer to copy the read data to the appropriate
location.

At last, regarding what you think - whether the implementation will be
suitable or not - I am not talking theories here. I have actually used
such a product for months - and it never gave a false positive, and
never allowed a virus to write to my hard disk. Maybe I was just lucky
and didn't use some of the programs you claim to cause false positives
if such a protection scheme is used. Could you name some particular
products?

Oh yes - why I am not using the product any more. Well, the Dark
Avenger wrote the Number of the Beast viruses, and the Phoenix
viruses, and the two guys from Varna wrote the MG viruses. All those
viruses don't try to bypass INT 13h - instead they intercept it at two
levels and fake a read when they want to do a write - so our nice
protection program sees a read request, tells the "device ready"
watching program "it's OK, buddy, let it pass", but here comes the
virus again and turns the request back to write... If you are an
anti-virus researcher worth your salt, you should be able to
understand what I am talking about by looking at the viruses I
mentioned...

As I wrote about, I am not talking "theoretically" here. It is
practical, it does work, I used a product that relied on this scheme
(and did a lot of other things, like providing a Cyrillic keyboard
driver, switching the character generators of the Bulgarian IBM PC
clones, displaying a clock and the status of the *Lock keys on the
26th line of the screen on CGA controllers), and it NEVER crashed my
disk. The only reason I stopped using it was because there appeared
viruses that were able to circumvent it and I hate to be given a false
sense of security. Well, yes, and I switched to EGA/VGA, but I also
switched to a different clock program which is still able to display a
clock on the 26th line... and the other bonuses too... :-)

Please, don't quote me out-of-contest - I specified when some hardware
anti-virus tools WILL and I mean will be able to stop this kind of
disk access. I am not claiming that all of them do it - just that
those of them that can do it WILL do it.

You'd expect? Then you'd expect wrong - as I said, ExVira is installed
exactly in this way. In practice, you plug the card in a free slot,
there is a flat cable that ends with something that resembles to a
piece of paper, metalized from one of the sides only. You put it in
the slot where the disk controller normally resides with the
non-metalized side down. It is flexible and fits in the slot. You then
insert the disk controller atop of it. The signals go to the
controller, from it to the ExVira card. The card is a whole computer,
with 68000 CPU, lots of RAM, ROM, and is attached not only to the hard
disk controller, but also to the keyboard.

Well, dunno, what do you mean exactly by that? A big high-loaded TSR
that has a small routine in conventional memory to call it? Dunno...
maybe; have to check.

Actually, I am no longer so sure about my initial statement. Padgett
demonstrated me how it is possible to make the resident part of the
virus occupy just 35 bytes. It is trivial to extend his idea into a
program that consists of 31+4 bytes - that is, 31 consecutive bytes in
one place and 4 consecutive bytes anywhere else - DOS is full of
holes...

Ah, yes, you are reminding me of something. We have such a project in
CARO. Exactly what you would like a database of technical virus
information (no scan strings, sorry) in a highly tokenized format -
so that it permits easy searching and report generation. It's only the
information skeleton - you can build a front end that uses the
information to generate human language descriptions which could be as
verbose as VSUM's entries, or just view it as database records with
some mnemonic expansion of the values of the fields - if you are
knowledgeable enough to understand them.

The format is ready, we also have a few virus descriptions that
illustrate how to use it. They are free for distribution or inclusion
in any products (commercial or not). However, the copyright is
retained by the University of Hamburg and you are not allowed to
modify the entries without our permission. The people who write each
entry have a copyright on it, but are granting it to the University
(at least this is what I understood; I am by no means competent in
these matters).

What you are reminding me is that I have to make this information
available by anonymous ftp. It will be accessible as

ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de:/pub/virus/texts/carobase/carobase.zip

Please, note that this is not a source of information about viruses -
at least not yet. It is practically empty. The important stuff is the
format of the database. The database itself is expected to be created
later.

Hmm, sorry I was unable to reproduce the problem. First, SCAN 102 does
not scan the memory twice, even if you supply the /chkhi option twice.
Second, it didn't find any viruses in memory, even with VSAFE loaded.

No, that is not correct, but since most of the common-users get infected
by viruses like form, cascade etc.. and wants to read about THOSE
viruses, then I think VSUM is good.

Sure, there are incorrect info in VSUM, but the users get the general
idea of what the virus does/does not. The COMMON user aren't interested
in all the technical stuff about that virus that they got infected by,
they wanna see if it does any harm or not, how it spreads.


Hope you get my point,

    This is indeed a (fairly) reliable method of resetting a PC.

A word of WARNING:
    This is flawed, in that it can potentially cause data damage to your
    PC.  Expanded Memory Managers, Disk Caches and other software often
    need to be warned of a reset, in order to reset hardware and empty
    write buffers.  I think the FAQ for comp.os.msdos.programmer has the
    appropriate information if you want to write a safe system reset
    program.  (OTOH warning other software of the reset effectively defeats
    trying to reset without allowing resident viruses to interfer.

If the server is setup correctly (trustee rights etc), all should be well (
famousee last words!). Novell is really good at stopping anything from 
changing a file that is read-only or the user only has read only rights. I'
ve tried along time to smash it, and lost! There is a command in netware 3.x 
that goes something like this

	"set executable files read only = on"

Yes, I know the set command is wrong, but what it does is makes *every* 
executable file read only and will not allow *any* file to be writen too, so 
the only way to upgrade a file is to first delete it and then copy a new one!

The real question is what if the following happens...


A virus waits till a user has write rights to SYS:SYSTEM, and then attaches 
itself to a NLM! stream.nlm or clib would be a good start! They are the 
libraries for netware, then once the virus is active, on the server now, not 
the workstation, it can do ANYTHING! From a NLM, you can delete, trash 
anything even if it has read only rights!

I believe that the new trend of viruses will be for netware (this is my 
opinion!) as NLM infectors!

Subject: BeBe Virus (PC)

Hello everyone.

Before you read this letter, you should be aware of the fact that it was not 
written at one time. It was written during a research I was (and still) doing.
It will be exported probable before the research is finished, so there might 
be more messages, although chances are small.

To the point:

A couple of days ago, I decided to go over the huge virus database I have, and
make it smaller, by removing duplicates, and infecting smaller files whenever
possible.

While doing that, I found a few interesting things:

1. One of the viruses, which I can't remember its name at the moment, tries to
   find the original vector of Interrupt 13h by searching for CMP DL,80 in the
   BIOS segment (0F000h), and therefore it didn't work on my computer - when
   I ran it, I had to load it into the debugger, and actually feed it with a
   vector to Interrupt 13h :-). I later found another virus, Cemetery, which
   is actually a Murphy mutant, which also tries to imply this trick, thus I
   tend to believe that the first one was also a Murphy mutant. However, this
   technique also appears to be used by the Dark Avenger virus, as I later
   found out.

2. The BeBe virus, for some reason, did not execute well. It hung the
   computer. What's more weird is that if I load it to a debugger and STEP it,
   it works. Even more weird is that if I load and GO, it hangs as well.

3. I have a virus, aliased 'Brothers in Arm'. I was very suprised to find that
   only SCAN has managed to find this virus, but even that not completely
   fine. Scan claimed there were both Brothes [Bro] and 1530 [1530]. TBSCAN
   (by ThunderByte) found nothing, as well as PF1's UNVIRUS. When I ran the
   infected program, nothing else ran afterwards - I simply returned to the
   DOS prompt. Even DIR returned nothing.

Any ideas as for the Bebe? The VSUM says that it won't replicate on 386's, but
hang - exactly what happened, but it doesn't say why. I suspect it has to do
with the virus's jmp instruction. The virus does a relocation-like operatin on
a FAR JMP instruction within itself, to jump to the virus code. After that, I
can run the program freely in DEBUG, and, like I said, it
works.

True. Moreover: *Most* programs will not touch the TRANSIENT, but
the large ones or the ones that allocates in the top of the memory on purpose. 
This design is a smart idea to allow more system flexibility, It doesn't mean

Hello Chris

General comment: In my original article I tried to explain the mechanism of 
the "SHELL", meaning the way it's devided and the objectives of each part. I 
merely stated a possible
mechanism of how a code might be loaded from a floppy with
no intention.

On a reply to Amir Netiv, Chris Franzen writes:

Thats true. You might overwrite it if you execute a program or allocate memory

True again. But consider the possibility that you use "DIR" from whithin a 
batch file (that also executes programs) the one prior to "DIR" might be the 
one that touched the TRANSIENT. Also what do you think about a program that "
shells" to DOS (running "DIR" from whithin a program), in this case the 
TRANSIENT also might have been touched at program load time, and the "shell- 
to-DOS" frees the memory for the operation (you see many times the instruction 
"Insert diskette with COMMAND.COM..." when running programs that exit to DOS 
to do some DOS operations).

As I said. It will not happened while typing "DIR" at the DOS prompt, but it

Nop. I say that the command.com expects to find the right part in the file on 
the floppy by means of a checksum, but we know how "easy" it is to trick this 
way of checking, and BTW, I've seen things happened when you are working with 
a floppy based system (no hard disk) and switch floppies like mad, (you've 
forgotten what it's like probably).

When you've booted from a floppy derive, the COMSPEC is A:\COMMAND.COM, (did

Absolutelly, and definitely TRUE. But what about "DIR" from whithin a program? 
The only question here is only: when can you replace the command.com to cause 
the reload of the TRANSIENT to load the infected one?

AN:

When you do a "DIR" from whithin a program (with "exec") you load another copy 
of command.com do to it, this might be the time when a "simple" does more then 
the user expects.

AN:

See.....

VB:

VB:

I just did, and I leave the rest for virus writers who might pick your 
challange.

Was this thread ever followed up. In Volume 5 Issue 41 1992, Vesselin
noted that no virus could survive the genuine or *real* Ctrl-Alt-Del
or warm re-boot. However, in Issue 44 David Chess notes:

Was this taken off-line and resolved? David, Vesselin?

Huh ?

No...it is much more likely that this is just a signature left in memory by
another anti-virus program...most of us producing anti-virus software try
to be compatible, and not cause false alarms for each other - but there are
a few companies that don't give a $#%%$# if their anti-virus program leave
virus search strings in memory, which may cause other programs to produce
false positives....this is starting to go on my nerves...I just hope they
get at least as many support calls because of this as I do.

Ah, well....back to work... :-)

- -----------------------------------------------------------
A new version of the ThunderByte antivirus utilities has
appeared, some major modifications are involved, including
the fact that it has its own virus signatures now.
This to replace the old tbav5xx files (the vsig9303 file
is still useful for htscan19, or for build-it-yourself
things perhaps). Validate info on the new .zips follows;
the "x" version has processor optimized executables for
registered users only (I'm not sure you'd want that, but
it's not that big); oh, and it needs the new pkunzip v2.04.
