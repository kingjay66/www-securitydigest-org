    I would like to get some books or papers by Fred Cohen, I only
know the name of a few books, 'A short course on Computer Viruses',
for instance, and a lot of papers. I would like to know if I can get
some of Cohen's works by mail, if anyone knows of a bookstore that
could send me those books via air mail or surface delivery to
Argentina, it would be of a great help.

Phooey. At least you _did_ ask the right question, "Why a virus?"

Fred Cohen is a bit "out there" when it comes to his ideologies about
what is or what is not a virus and further, what is a "good virus," if
there really _is_ such a critter. My personal opinion is that there
cannot be such an animal, because by its purest definition, a virus is
any program that _replicates_ -- if it doesn't replicate, then be
assured that it is not a virus.

Ideally, a virus replicates without the user's knowledge. In doing
this, it violates the integrity of the system and furthermore, it does
it surreptitiously. Personally, I like to be intamately aware of every
byte on each of my systems (I am) and know _exactly_ what every
executable which resides on my system does (again, I do). For users
who cannot know this, then a virus is a breech of their privacy, in a
matter of speaking.

Finally, distributed computing need not be accomplished by something
as brain-damaged as a virus. Anything a virus could beneficially do, a
legitimate, non-replicating program can do better. In fact, there have
been viruses designed and coded which were supposed to perform
beneficial activities (see historical notes about the Denzuko, Ohio,
etc. viruses). Also, every virus harbors the potential for damage. No
programmer (read: virus author) can possibly know each and every
environment where the code will be introduced. An example which I
frequently use to illustrate this point is the Stoned virus; it is
mostly an innocuous virus, however with several spoofing disk
partitioning schemes (such as Disk Mangler), it can devastating. And
with the advent of the Microsoft Doublspace shit, alot of other
potholes in the road are introduced into the possible scenarios.

A final note: There is a virus called "Cruncher" which compresses
executables in much the same way as PKLite or LZEXE. Is this a "good"
virus? This ia an exercise left to the reader...

Cheers from Washington, DC

Subject: E-Rillutanza virus? (PC)

I recently scan my hard disk using F-prot 2.09 and it reported that
several COM files were 'suspicious' of being infected with a variant of
E-Rillutanza virus. I promptly emailed to Mcafee asking if they had heard
of it but apparently they hadn't.
I also scan the harddisk with scan106 for Mcafee but it didn't show any
sign of the above mention virus.
I believe that my disk was indeed infected because the size of the program
were altered compared to the original.
I managed to remove it from my disk by deleting and reinstalling (I hope).
What I want to know is that have anyone had a similar report using F-Prot
which scan106 missed.
At the moment the 'virus' had done no damage except incresing the file
size. The only problem is when I tried to upgrade Qemm7.00 to version 7.01
using the patch. When it came across loadhi.com it reported that the
program is invalid (or something like that) and stopped updating.
Loadhi.com was among one of the program reported as suspicious by F-Prot.

Mun Wai.

I seem to be having a problem with f-prot 209.  I am a programming
assitant at MSU computer services.  On two different occations and on
two different computers, We have been infected with stoned (no-int)
(on the hard drive).  Both computers are ibm ps/2 model 30 with a 30
meg hard. F-Prot 209 is unable to fix the disk.  The progrma sends an
error message, something like -- unable to find original MBR, I don't
remeber the exact wording.  I then used F-Prot 208a and it fixed the
disk no prob.

No. It intercepts this function and desinfects a file on the harddisk (!) if

No text is visible in the virus.

This virus appends to the end of files.

This virus infected infected every .EXE bait file I use on
my test machine.

I tested The second generation of this virus, and it is
infectious as well.

Dudley is an Australian virus; the one that caused a great upheaval at
Telecom recently (Allegedly written by someone at Optus!).  Our
program VET will detect it, and disinfect infected files.

VET is writtten and widely used in Australia, and is
increasingly being used overseas.  It is fast, easy to use, and
safely recovers files and disks infected with most of the viruses
which are actually in the field.

VET is a mid price product; cheaper than Dr. Solomons Toolkit, but
more expensive than F-Prot, which are the two most nearly comparable
products.  They will usually detect a few more viruses than VET, but
VET is faster, and does a better job of recovering PCs infected with
boot sector viruses.  McAfee Scan is decidely slower, far more
difficult to use, generates more false alarms, and has a number of
serious bugs, which can cause loss of data on hard disks, especially
when trying to remove MBR infectors, such as No-Int, Stoned and
Michelangelo.

Our normal license includes updates for one year, posted quarterly,
and covers PCs belonging to staff/students, provided all PCs on the
site are covered.

   As i wrote to you a week ago: Check your own PC before blaming
   others! since I personally checked sample floppies from EACH
   supermarket store + The masters used for duplication + the
   duplication factory itself and more.

   Gues what: non of them was infected !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

1. I did not blame anyone for the viruses on the disk.  I said that
   the disk I got had these viruses and that I notified the
   supermarket chain.  The fact that both sample floppies and the
   masters are clean indicate that disks must have been contaminated
   after distribution.  Perhaps people were playing with the disks in
   the stockroom?  Perhaps disks were being brought back after being
   used (and getting infected)?  Perhaps my machine was infected?
   However,

2. I did check my PC.  It is clean (according to mcafee scan version
   106).

3. An article in an Israeli newspaper said that some of the disks were
   infected with DIR2 and with STONED, and that "dozens of people were
   affected by the viruses".  Since *I* haven't been distributing this
   disk, and since *I* was not in contact with this paper, OTHER
   PEOPLE also have seen the SAME VIRUSES on the game disks.  Thus,
   either "dozens of people" have the same viruses on their machines
   and didn't notice them until they checked out this game disk, or
   the game disk is infected.  Take your pick.

Subject: Barrotes (PC)

Recently we detected this virus on our PCs.  We would like to find
information about it (i.e. is it destructive) but are unable to find
the name anywhere.  Are there other names it might go by?  It was
undetectable by MS DOS 6 anti-virus but detected by McAfee.  It
doesn't seem to do much more than attach itself to executable files.
Because it changed the executables, we had trouble running Norton
Commander and Turbo Pascal.  Both of these programs would run,
however, after much prompting.

Any help, suggestions, or comments are welcome.  The PCs are now clean
but we would still like to know.

Thank you,

Subject: unknown (?) virus (PC)

I have a virus here that can not be detected by VSCAN105.

When you call an infected program on a clean system, the virus first
infects the program to which the COMSPEC variable points, normally
COMMAND.COM, increasing it by exactly 4000 bytes, which it also does
with most programs (EXE or COM) called afterwards. After a call of
such a program, the virus stays resident (using little less than 4000
bytes) and infects more and more other programs. Yet it doesn't like
windows applications and some others.

When you scan a file on an infected system, the virus re- builds its
exact contents. (This is how you get rid of it, simply zipping
infected files on an infected system and un- zipping them on a clean
one.) When the virus is resident, the DIR command doesn't show the
4000 additional bytes. But the Norton disk editor does.

Is this is a known virus or is it new? If so, I'd suggest to call it
the proton virus!

Subject: Friday 13th virus? (PC)

Thoughout yesterday, Friday 13th August, I was transferring files
among floppy, local and network (Netware 3.11) drives, and thought I
saw that some old files took on the August 13 date.  I said to myself
'Nah, maybe it's that 14th cup of coffee...' But when I noticed the
same thing during a technical support call with a customer - that her
PKUNZIP.EXE (v 2.04c - the 12/28/92 version with a bug) had a date of
8/13/93 - I became more suspicious.  The in-house network supervisor
went ahead and scanned network drives without detecting anything.  He
told me that the known Friday 13th PC virus is only supposed to
corrupt data and affect file execution, not anything as serious as
going around changing file dates.  Has anyone had this experience?

Postscript: our network server did happen to go down at 4:30pm.

Subject: New (?) "Moose" virus (PC)

I have recently taken charge of a PC lab for the students at the
Chemistry Department of Chalmers University of Technology,
Gothenburg, Sweden. The lab has 24 PCs (Acer 33/468DX, local hard
disks, 3 1/2" diskettes, DOS 5.0) and Novell 3.11 server. The
local net has world access via internet. More than 600 students
use the lab.

The following is what I have found over the last three days (in
roughly chronological order). Please bear with me for the length
of this text - nothing in what I have seen is reproducible.

  * some PCs refused to boot

  * some PCs had enormous disk access during boot (warm & cold)

  * .EXE files with increased file size - on inspection of these
    files I found FAR JP codes to the end of the file and added code
    containing readable text strings "Moose31", "Moose32" or
    both, in the last case because code had been added twice to
    the files. The string "*.EXE" was also readable. Infected
    files sometimes work, sometimes not. Depending on type of
    code added (see more below) increases in file sizes vary -
    for a single file, I have seen at least five different versions
    with sizes from 464 bytes to +1700 bytes on different PCs

  * tests with Central Point CPAV (old version), MS-DOS 6.0 MSAV,
    McAfee SCAN (ver. 9.17 v106), Dr Solomon's Toolkit (virus list
    from 10/5/92) and Frisk Skulason's F-PROT (ver 2.09) all failed
    to detect anything. CPAV and F-PROT detected infections of
    themselves and CPAV detected increased file sizes.

  * .COM files with increased file size contain added code with
    readable text strings "Moose30" and "*.COM"

  * COMMAND.COM infected on a few PCs.

  * .EXE files infected on file server and all PCs

  * a message "Divide overflow" during boot on some PCs

  * diskette drives refusing to work - some working again after
    cold boots

  * eternal boot sessions with continuos disk access on some PCs -
    these will almost always boot from a diskette.

  * fake message (screen blanked first) "insert boot diskette and
    press <enter>" on machine that would not cold-boot from diskette.
    Inserting a write-protected boot diskette did not work.

  * attempted write operations on write-protected boot diskettes
    (after executing programs on hard disk); sometimes without
    error message, sometimes with normal DOS error message.

  * MS-DOS.SYS infected with "Moose30" on at least one PC (but not
    on some of the more troublesome one's)

  * parts of the CPAV.EXE code (The self-integrity check part)
    appended to some infected .EXE files

  * examination of the partion records with Solomon's PEEKA resulted
    in the following:
      the first display looked ok
      moving to the next record caused the display to be distorted
        (display heading with cyl/head/sector info gone) and an
        extra 64 bytes (copies of the first 64 bytes of the
        partion record) to be displayed at offset 0. This means that
        40h + 200h bytes were displayed. Refreshing the display by
        pressing the space bar restored the display to normal.
      by keeping the + key down (switches between alpha and hex
        display) I was able to see a message
          "Disk read error 12 - Unknown error response."
        flash on the screen. It was immediatly overwritten.
      whatever is displayed seems normal, except for the extra 64
      bytes

  * finally, this morning a 2 am, DISPLAY.SYS and EGA.SYS converted to
    COM files on one PC (this PC has also shown the "Divide overflow"
    and the fake "insert boot diskette .." message). These files
    have their original names left but start with a NEAR JP to the end
    where code has been after the Microsoft copyright notice. This
    code starts with a NEAR JP further ahead in the code and is
    followed by the readable text string
      "This, and much more, from Moose crashing corp."

I don't know what all this adds up to. I have little experience of
viruses, but I have tried to read what's available over the last few
days. I haven't experimented much with diskettes, but it looks like
everything at once - BSV, PSV, stealth, etc.

I should add that there are a number of hacked and cracked games
on the PCs - the previous system manager hasn't done anything about
it. He also hasn't had the server backup system working since March
(funny ?).

Has anybody seen the "Moose" before ? Any hints ?

I am now trying to collect some of the strange files. These will
be forwarded to the virus expert community. Are there some special
things that I should do? I will have to start low-level formatting
the PC hard disks and recharge the server soon. Hordes of students
are approaching ....

For anyone familiar with Swedish - my name is not a hoax
(For non-Swedish speakers: Renman means reindeer-man in Swedish).

Both the .com files in this .zip are infected with a new strain of the
butterfly virus.

Everyone who downloaded the file (only a small number) in the 6 or so
hours it was on line before the virus was detected (It passed the
initial scrutiny for the same reason as you failed to detect the
virus) has been notified by CIX and told how to remove the infection.
It is a trivial non-destructive virus that does not go memory
resident and only infects .com files.

BTW I am a moderator of the conference that held the file at CIX.

Ooh, there is a little prbolem: "TridenT" is a name of virus research
group. The member of this group, MK (such a 'east' name like Mas??? Kadif?
- - I dont remember it exactly) done a polymorphic engine that is a MtE like
(only a like, because this engine is not as good as Darkie's MtE, it use
such a prototypes to create encryptor (thats why scan report so many false
alarms, cause they use a debuger as for a MtE encryptor and they must use
a large instruction set :-)
So .... there are severals viruses by TridenT ...

NETSHIELD Version 1.52a fixes a problem in reading the configuration
file from the 1.50 and 1.51 releases of NETSHIELD.  No changes other
than loading the new version should be necessary.

NETSHIELD Version 1.52 automatically ignores changes made to the Novell
NetWare bindery files NET$OBJ.SYS, NET$PROP.SYS, and NET$VAL.SYS when
performing CRC checking for unknown viruses.  This prevents NETSHIELD
from reporting that these frequently-changing data files have been
infected by a virus.

Subject: "Link" virus (CVP)

DEFGEN6.CVP   930729

                           "Link" virus

This term will be familiar only to those using Atari and Amiga
systems, but for others, this is simply the standard "file
infecting" virus.  For most people, this is what is thought of as a
virus.  (For most, that is, who have *any* accurate idea of what a
virus is.  For all too many people, a "virus" is simply any computer
problem.)

File infecting viral programs "link", or attach, in many different
ways.  The largest number will place the bulk of the viral code to
the end of the program file, with a "jump" command at the beginning
of the file which "points" to the main body of the virus.  Some
viral code attaches to the beginning of the file: simpler in concept
but actually more difficult in execution.  These two techniques are
known as "appending" and "prepending" respectively, but the terms
are used less than they used to be.

Some viral programs do not attach to the beginning or end of the
file, but rather write their code into the target program itself.
Most often this is done by simply overwriting whatever is there
already.  Most of the time the virus will also attach a jump command
at the beginning of the program which points to the virus, but, on
occasion, the virus will rely on chance to stumble on the code and
run it.  Of course, if a virus has overwritten existing code the
original "target" program is damaged, and there is little or no
possibility of recovery, other than by deleting the infected file
and restoring from a clean backup copy.  However, some overwriting
viri are known to look for strings of null characters.  If such can
be identified, the viral code can be removed and replaced with nulls
again.  (The Lehigh virus, for example, attaches "behind" the
COMMAND.COM file in a sense, but overwrites slack space at the end
of the file so as not to change the file size.)

Some viri do not physically "touch" the target file at all.  There
are two ways to "infect" in this manner.  One method is quite
simple, and takes advantage of "precedence" in the system.  In MS-
DOS, for example, when a command is given, the system checks first
for internal commands, then COM, EXE and BAT files in that order.
EXE files can be "infected" by writing a COM file in the same
directory with the same filename.

The second method is more difficult.  "FAT" or "system" viral
programs, such as DIR-II, will not change the target program, but
will change the FAT (file allocation table) entry for the program so
as to point to the virus.  Therefore, the original file will not be
changed, but when the target program is called, the virus will be
run first instead.
