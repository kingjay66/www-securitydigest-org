If course it didn't - that was the point.  It was a survey of disasters
at mainframe sites and despite the only examples given in the text being
about PC viruses or {cr|h}acking problems the journalists still manged
to write a heading saying "MAINFRAMES HIT BY EPIDEMIC OF VIRUSES" and a
subhead saying "Mainframe systems are more at risk from viruses than
from any other form of computer disaster", both of which are clearly
stupidly nonsensical!

Can anyone contribute the names and dates of prominent magazines
which have done reviews of anti-virus software. All I know of is
the recent PC Week (Nov 9) issue. There must be more. This group
should be able to help (especially if a contributing vendor got
a good review :-)).

I went to the library where I work and saw a very surprisingly
large number of books on viruses, but a sampling showed they
were either old or quite simple. Can people also provide a few
names of books on viruses that they found useful and who should
be reading that book (in your opinion).

The last list I want to assemble is a list of conferences in
which virus papers are welcome. That's all for now.

Subject: Defining a virus

NO! It is NOT another natural language definition of a virus.
In the last issues I have seen many postings that try to do that.
Now the question is: is it possible to define a computer virus
using just English words ? I think it is not.
Post a definition and in the next issue you will find at least one
counter example (most of the times a funny counter example).
It is even possible that later one shows a flaw in the flaw and so on.
(We have seen The DiskCopy Virus, The MS-DOS Virus and others).
I am not saying these definitions are not important. They ARE ! Their main
purpose is to provide information, to help in clarifying the concepts.
But one can not expect much more from them. They will always be a little
ambiguous, imprecise, incomplete, just like any other natural language
definition.  If you needs precision, turn to a mathematical definition.
I know it has its own problems, but you can not get all...

Sorry, but I disagree.  According to definition (c), whether the pro-
gram is a virus depends on whether x < y on a *specific* run of the
program, whereas the decision must be based on *appearance* of the
program alone; you can't look at what the user inputs on that run.
Therefore the list which you mention above cannot be used, and your
above comments are irrelevant in this case.

  I think there's another mistake in your argument.  Suppose, for
example, that a program asks the user to input two integers x, y of
*arbitrary* size, and it will output their sum, even though it is
running on a finite machine.  Is such a thing possible?  According
to your above reasoning, it isn't.  However, you are tacitly assuming
that x and y must be entered completely by the user before the program
can output its result.  That is not necessarily the case.  Suppose
that the user enters the least significant digit of x and the lsd of
y.  Then the program can output the lsd of x+y, storing the carry
digit.  Then the user enters the next digits, etc.  There is *no
limit* to the size of x and y which can be handled by this method,
even though the machine is finite.  True, the *time* is unbounded when
this method is used, but the storage is not.

Subject: Re: [Lambdin's] idea for detecting file infectors

  Bill Lambdin describes his idea for detecting new and unknown file
infectors.  I won't bother quoting any passages from his posting,
since if I understand him correctly, the basic idea can be summed up
in a few words: When you are reasonably sure that your computer is
virus-free, compress copies of a few commonly used program files into
an archive.  (This is apparently the BAIT archive in his examples,
although he doesn't explain this fact.)  Then periodically re-archive
these files and compare the resulting archive with the original one.

  There are various details which could be discussed (e.g., is it
really justified to limit this to only *a few* files?), but the main
point is that this is simply a form of *integrity checking* which,
contrary to most implementations, does not use checksums.  What can it
offer that the checksum method does not?  It certainly requires much
more storage for each such file (roughly speaking, it adds about 70%
of the size of each such file instead of the 4 bytes required by most
checksum algorithms).  It also requires much more time to re-archive
the files than to run most checksum comparers on the same number of
files.  Considering that checksum programs can be obtained as share-
ware or even freeware, I find no compensating advantages for this
method over checksumming.

Here are some questions:

1)  Is writing a virus (and not distributing it) illegal?
2)  Is writing then distributing a virus (though hiding it
    in trojan horse programs on BBS's) illegal?
3)  Is writing a virus, then distributing it, but making sure
    people know it is a virus (i.e. virus's for sale!) illegal?
4)  Is receiving a virus, then passing it on illegal?
5)  Is possesion of a virus illegal?

Please differentiate between civil and criminal legality, and
mention jurisdiction.

I am just wondering if you got a virus, and passed it on accidently,
could you be held civilly at fault for thousands of dollars of
damage say if it got into a business?

Subject: ***CDEF & Disinfectant 2.9 (MAC)*****

I am using the Disinfectant 2.9 init to check for viruses and a computer
got infected with CDEF and the init did not flag it.  When i used the
Disinfectant application, it saw the virus but the init still did not see
it, even after reinstalling the init after cleaning and reinfecting the
the disk on purpose.  The computer was a Mac IIcx on system 6.05. I am
also running tests on Macs running system 7.0.1 and the inits don't seem
to see the virus.  Rebuilding the desktop destroys the virus but if I
cannot dtect it in the first place I will have to rebuild desktops every
morning.
Does anyone know anything about this phenomenon.  Is there a new CDEF out
there??  Can I send a copy to the maker of Disinfectant 2.9 .  What is
his/her name and address.  Has this happened to anyone else??
Is disinfectant init 2.9 system seven compatible?/
Is the CDEF virus system seven compatible?? if there is any such criteria
of judging viruses??
If the virus came from an undetected system seven computer onto the IIcx
with system 6.05, would it still be detectable??  Is this the case I am
experiencing??
Can this lack of detection spread to cover other viruses??
Are there any known inits that disable or corrupt the functioning of the
Disinfectant init??
The disinfectant init always loads first and it even did not flag floppy
disks.
I need quick replies so please e-mail me with any answers or questions.

Thanks a million in advance for the help.

This is all explained in some detail in the Disinfectant online manual. I
will summarize briefly:

The Disinfectant INIT catches viruses at the point of attack. The INIT does
not scan volumes looking for dormant viruses like some of the commercial
anti-viral INITs. If a virus never attacks, the INIT will not catch it.

System 7 is immune to the desktop viruses WDEF and CDEF. They never attack
under System 7. Hence, under System 7, the Disinfectant INIT does not catch
them.

WDEF and CDEF normally attach under System 6, and the Disinfectant INIT
normally catches them.

In either case (System 6 or System 7), if the Disinfectant INIT is properly
installed and active, neither WDEF nor CDEF should be able to spread from
an infected floppy or other volume to the Mac hard drive or other volume.
If this is indeed hapenning to you, I definitely want to see a copy of the
virus. It may be a slight variant of the known CDF strain, or there may be
some other problem.

Subject: re:os2-stuff (OS/2)

Hi,
the question, whether a dos-virus can access a DLL is definetively to be
answered with YES. I run my both HDs with HPFS. In order to install the
english version of the servicepack over my german version I had to change 2
bytes in OS2SYSLEVEL(?) which is not a DLL but this does nothing about it.
I used DEBUG from a DOS-session to do this, as I had no hex-editor available.
Therefore: If a user can access any file which is not in use by another program
,
then a virus can do this too... It is not a question of protected mode or
whatever state the CPU is in (unless it is hung :-)
This is why I think DLLs should be scanned too.

DAME is not a virus. It is a routine that virus authors can add to the
viruses they write.

DAME is an acronym for "Dark Avenger Mutation Engine" It is also known as
MtE.

The Mutation Engine adds about 3.5K to the virus, and enables the virus to
mutate so the virus hardly ever appears the same way twice.

McAfee's Scan can detect the MtE, but if it isn't satisfactory, try
F-Prot. I have 2.06a, but have heard that F-Prot 2.07 has been released.

Hope this has been helpful.

I recently purchased the ProAudio Spectrum 16 multi-program MIDI
package for use on my home PC.  I am also reviewing Novi Anti-Virus
Software by Certus, v 1.1.

Novi is instructing me that the program (within ProAudio Spectrum), Monolog.exe
contains the Tequila Virus.  I contacted Media Vision and made them aware
of this 'problem.'  They agreed to send me another copy of the monolog.exe.

Well, it arrived yesterday and I scanned it with Novi immediately.  Again,
I am being informed of a Tequila Virus in Monolog.exe.  Being that the
Tequila Virus is stealth and multi-partite, I am being very cautious; but
I do not know which way to go.

Anyone have any suggestions?

Subject: Stoned, McAfee Scan update and comments. (PC)

Thanks to everyone who explained what was going on with Scan.  To
summarize, most people recognized that Stoned was being loaded into
memory when the boot sector was read to perform a scan.  As most
people pointed out, although stoned was in memory, it was not active
and was in fact completely harmless.  That's the good news.

The bad news (and comment), of course, is that McAfee's Scan/Clean
INSISTS on making a truly annoying and unnerving beeping sound,
declares Stoned to be active in memory, tells you to shutdown
immediately, and then promptly turns itself off.  Frankly, for all the
skill/intelligence necessary to write an anti-virus program, this is
pretty retarded IMHO.

Anyhoo....  Thanks again for all the help folks!

Subject: Re: MtE Infected... (PC)

 NAV detects quite a few false positives with the MtE scanning
algorithm. For what it's worth, try scanning some Sierra game demos with
NAV v2.1 and you will find that 85% of the DRV files are "infected" with
an MtE virus (A GROSS false positive).

 I'm not saying that you are not infected, just merely stating that NAV
has a tendency of being overly paranoid in detecting MtE engines. More
information would be of value in determining whether or not you are
really infected. Try McAfee's SCAN v100 which detects MtE more reliably.

When Michelangelo virus infects the hard disk it saves the original
MBR in sector 7, head zero, track zero, and puts itself in sector
one.  So when you boot it runs, installs itself, and then loads &
runs the original MBR from sector 7.  No worries!

Stoned does exactly the same, and again no worries.  However neither
recognises the other, so if you have Michelangelo, and boot from a
floppy infected with Stoned, it puts the MBR (ie Michelangelo) in
sector 7, and puts itself in sector one.  Now, when you try to boot,
Stoned installs itself, and loads and runs sector 7.  However this
contains M, which installs itself, and loads & runs sector 7.
However this ....    Big troubles!

This presents no problem to properly written software, but Clean
just says "Oh; You've got Stoned (or M)?  No worries; I'll just copy
sector 7 back to sector 1, & that'll fix it."  It does just that,
without ever bothering to check that the sector it is putting back
is clean.

So the first time it ran it replaced the Stoned with the M.  Now
each time you run it it simply copies the M back from sector 7 to
sector 1.

The immediate solution for your friend is to run FDISK /MBR from
DOS 5, but the long term solution is to buy a program which will
check that the recovered sector is clean before it puts it back, and
put back a "plain vanilla" boot sector if it can't find a clean one.

All this has been well known for several years (I described this,
and an even more serious bug in Scan/Clean, in New York in 1991
(1.)), but McAfee has never seen fit to do anything about it.
