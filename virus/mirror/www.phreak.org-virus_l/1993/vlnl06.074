Ok, but, please, consider that: as yourself state, the net is
international, and so it's quite difficult to 'censor' the info
sharing, minding at those country where some tricks/things are
forbidden. For example, the Great Britain: since the net is accessible
from UK, then I must be very careful to not post here anything is
forbidden in UK, isn't?  But, so this forum will be useless... there
will be room only for obvious and well-known arguments, not good
technical hints. I think, in this peculiar scenario, the
responsability will be of who *receives* the info. If I was British, I
was aware that it's illegal for me to write a virus, so if here
somebody shows some virus code, or point out where get a copy of
40-Hex, I simply ignore those info. If not, I'll be resposible for
that. 'Cause I wasn't forced to traduce the code into a functional
virus, almost I wasn't forced by this forum. It's quite like the
X-rated movies, nobody is forced to enter in a red-lights cinema, and
you are aware at the entrance about the kind of movies there are: at
you the decision.  But since the international community doesn't
forbid and/or consider illegal this kind of info share (we are not
able to match a single judgement here, between us, figure yourself at
which point will be the legislators), I wouldn't be on the censors
side.

Those are not analogous, unless the cooking magazines you're referring to
actually have recipes for salmonella.  (There are publications containing
instructions for using a variety of poisons, and THOSE are analogous to
virus magazines.)

The issue at hand is whether publications containing virus code and other
details provides potential virus authors with the materiel they need to
create viruses that can cause problems for other computer users.  They do. 
If a virus author uses information gleaned from such a magazine to create a
virus, then that magazine is responsible, to some extent, for the result.  I
don't intend the word "responsible" here to indicate legal culpability; I'll
leave that issue to the lawyers.  There's definitely a causal relationship,
though.

Yes and no..."data" does not mean just search strings. In my case (F-PROT)
I detect *most* viruses with search patterns, or other data entries - there are
only a few cases where I have to use actual C code to detect a particular
virus....MtE, V2P6, Whale, Starship and a few other cases.

Yes, and that is indeed what I have to do today.  When a new virus appears
that cannot be detected with a search pattern or any of my database-driven
methods, I have to release a code update - that is, I have to make a change
to my C code, instead of my signature files.

But so what ?

A change is a change - and to me it does not matter what I have to change to
detect the virus - as long as it gets detected :-)

Well, there was one anti-virus package some months ago, which Virus Bulletin
refused to review as it was copy-protected, but I think they have now dropped
the copy-protection.

I have been told that there are UNIX viruses (not talking about
worms or Trojan horses).  Is there a place on the net where
UNIX viruses are documented?

Is it true that a virus would find the UNIX environment very
inhospitable because of the protection the OS puts around its
own memory space and the confinment of the users memory space.

Hello,

I was reading in the book : Take a road trip with the MS-DOS 6 Upgrade.
this book comes with this version of DOS.

It says on page 79 something about a virus that is known to infect datafiles.

infect a datafile ? , don't they mean that there is some code that could be
a firus that is stored in a file witch is not executable ?

How can a non-exacutable be a threath to you ?

an other thin about MS (CP) AV is that it default scans ALL files on disk.
(this takes a lot of time on a 213Mb HDD). Is this realy neccesery or
is huristic scanning stupid ? ....

Well, I'm only a law student, but . . .
Probably not.  Copyright protects expression of ideas, not the ideas.
Thus, you couldn't copyright E=MC^2, though you could copyright
a book explaining it.
Also, generally speaking, the shorter the expression, the harder it is
to copyright.  If you tried to copyright the  letter A, you'd lose, 
because others are going to need to use it.

The scanner would probably be copyrightable like any other software,
regardless of the inclusion of that one virus sig.

To be precise, 386spart.par is actually a hidden, _system_ file.  
It is the permanent swap file that Windows creates for use as
virtual memory when running in 386 Enhanced Mode.  If you don't
like it being there when you exit windows, you can switch to 
using a temporary swap file (refer to your Window's User's 
Guide), but your performance will suffer.

As for the disk drive running while you are doing nothing disk
related in windows -- get use to it.  It's the nature of the
beast.

Well... the inclusion of the copyright owner's name (and the year of
copyright) is only necessary in the U.S. of A. (where they're backward
enough not to have fully adopted the internationally recognised
copyright laws devised at the Bourne convention).

Secondly, if the virus author could prove that (s)he wrote the virus,
AND the virus scanner contained a substantial piece of the author's
creative effort, then the author WOULD (not could) claim copyright if
(s)he so wished. (S)he could then attempt to sue the trousers off the
parties who infringed their copyright. In the process, however, I would
hope that the author also had their lower garments sued off them for the
grief that the virus caused, AND had the potential to cause.

Subject: RE the stoned virus and 3.5" floppies (PC)

Don't believe that the stoned virus can only occur on 5.25 floppies.
The reason this misinformation developed is that the original virus
would only infect the disk in A: drive.  Normally the drive that is A:
will not change over the life of the machine. Thus since stoned was
initially released on 5.25 floppies it was (mistakenly) assumed that
it could not spread to 3.5".

There is, however, a scenario which I reported to Dr Solomon in 1990 in
which a 3.5" floppy can become infected.  A friend bought a Toshiba
(brand is unimportant, I think) laptop with an external 5.25" drive
and an internal 3.5" drive.  Interestingly enough, when the external 
drive was attached *it* was A: drive.  But, when the external drive
was absent the *internal* *3.5"* drive was A: drive.

Infected floppy in 5.25" boots up, virus moves to internal hard disk,
next time a 3.5" floppy is in machine with no external drive *it* is in
A: drive, and thus infected.  I have seen this happen.  Further I 
presented Dr Solomon with an infected 3.5" floppy at a seminar in 
Australia immediately after he had said that stoned didn't come on
3.5" disks.  I have since noticed that his comments have been modified.
It is gratifying to see a scientist who recognises a fact even if it 
doesn't fit his theories.

Subject: New variety of Stoned virus? (PC)

Yesterday we had (yet another!) hit from the Stoned virus.  Surprisingly,
the latest version (2.08) of F-Prot wouldn't clean it, although an older
copy of MacAfee's Scan (version 97, I think) removed it.

Both floppy drives stopped reading high-density diskettes at the same 
time the PC was infected although I suspect that was coincidence and not 
virus-related...

Subject: Novell NLM Viruses (PC-servers)

	This point has come up before but I do not know of any and
while an NLM virus could be written, it would be relatively difficult
to introduce into a system given the dual state nature of a Novell
client-server relationship (3.11 or above).

	True, a malicious person with physical (boot) access to the server
might be able to introduce an NLM trojan into the system (a virus would
be pointless at the moment) that would act as a "dropper" onto the clients.

	Now earlier versions and all "peer-peer" networks have much
different vulnerability levels since these machines can be operated
as combination workstations/servers & this removes the "dual-state"
protection inherant in a dedicated server. 

	For instance, I like LANTASTIC very much as a simple and effective 
networking system. However, as a "trusted" system it has three major
vulnerabilities:
1: LANTASTIC runs under DOS & uses DOS interrupts
2: The server is also a workstation (yes, I know about "ALONE")
3: There is no provision for login scripting

(Note: I am not picking on LANTASTIC, I have yet to see a peer-peer LAN
 that does not have these characteristics but have used LANTASTIC AI and
 have purchased LANTASTIC-Z which makes an effective teaching tool. - 
 Further the problems I note are correctable if login scripting were 
 possible.)

	However, for the moment I would not be concerned about a NLM
virus provided that the physical security of the server is maintained.
To become active, a virus must be executed. To spread a virus must
have access to many different machines and neither is much of a risk on
a weel-maintained, dedicated Novell server.

Subject: F-PROT v2.08 (PC)

Our site has a site-license for f-prot.  I downloaded 2.08 from wuarchive a 
couple of days ago.  We have had a problem with it.

It discovered the Stoned virus with no problem, however, it was unable to 
dis-infect the virus.  2.07 worked just fine, and we went back to that 
version to get rid of the virus.

Any one else have this problem?

Subject: thanks re 386spart.par (PC)

I just wanted to thank everyone who responded to my query about the
hidden file 386spart.par.  For those who did not see the answer, it is
the Windows permanent swap file, and is mentioned in the Manual (I did
check). Thanks again. -Warren Redlich skank@leland.stanford.edu
