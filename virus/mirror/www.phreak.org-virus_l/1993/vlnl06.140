Will you accept a grammatical analysis from a native (southern, but not
Swiss) speaker?

Actually, the phrase is grammatically unambiguous; yet, the difference
between the two German phrases Douglas has translated hinges on a mere
comma! Let me explain:
- - "unbefugt", "elektronisch", and "in vergleichbarer Weise" all are
  adverbs; adverbs can (as the term is suggesting :-) , and as Douglas
  has implied) qualify either a verb (including its participle forms), or
  an adjective (including its adverbial form).
- - "gespeicherte" and "gel>schte" are plural forms of past participles,
  "l>scht", and "wird ... belegt" are finite verb forms; hence all of
  these could be qualified by adverbs.
- - Several adverbs qualifying the same part of a sentence, must be
  separated by conjunctions (term??), such as "oder", or by commata.
  Thus, "elektronisch", and "in vergleichbarer Weise", are marked by
  "oder" to qualify the same part of the sentence, viz. "gespeicherte
  oder ubermittelte". (They could, indeed, interpreted to qualify
  "gespeicherte" alone, but this does not make much sense to me.)
  If the third adverb, "unbefugt" is meant to join these two in
  qualifying the same part of the sentence, you would have to connect
  it in one of two possible ways: either via a conjunction, as in
  "unbefugt oder elektronisch oder in vergleichbarer Weise", or by a
  comma, as in "unbefugt, elektronisch oder in vergleichbarer Weise".
- - If, on the other hand, "unbefugt" is meant to qualify the predicate,
  "l>scht", you have to place it within the sentence (i.e. no comma).
  There are two possible positions to place it: either before, or after,
  the object, "... gespeicherte ... Daten".

Summary:

- - "Wer unbefugt, elektronisch oder in vergleichbarer Weise gespeicherte
  oder ubermittelte Daten l>scht, ..." means either "Whoever erases
  data that have been stored or transmitted either without authorisation,
  or electronically, or in comparable ways, ..." or "Whoever, either
  without authorization, or electronically, or in comparable ways,
  erases data that have been stored or transmitted, ...". Note that this
  is *not* the proposed wording.

- - "Wer unbefugt elektronisch oder in vergleichbarer Weise gespeicherte
  oder ubermittelte Daten l>scht, ..." means "Whoever, without
  authorisation, erases data that have been stored or transmitted either
  electronically, or in comparable ways, ...". Note the missing comma
  that makes all the difference.

- - The latter meaning could less ambiguously expressed by: "Wer
  elektronisch oder in vergleichbarer Weise gespeicherte oder
  ubermittelte Daten unbefugt l>scht, ...". However, lawyers are used
  to find the qualifier "unbefugt" right after the initial "Wer".
  Thus, this essential qualifier would be prone to being overlooked
  by those professionals in this wording, even if it seems unambiguous to
  the layman...

Btw, both of Douglas' proposed translations contain the term "useless"
which is not in the German text. My translation of the whole article is:
"Whoever, without authorization, erases, modifies, or renders unusable,
electronically, or in a comparable way, stored, or transmitted, data, or
creates, promotes, offers, makes available, or circulates in any other
way, means destined for unauthorized deletion, modification, or rendering
unusable, of such data, will be inflicted with the same punishment, if a
petition is filed."

Note that, to a layman, the whole article still contains a syntactical
ambiguity (I hope I got it through to my English version): the adverb
"unbefugt" ("without authorization") could either qualify the predicate
of the first half sentence, viz. "l>scht .. macht", alone, or the
predicates of both half sentences, viz. "l>scht ... macht oder herstellt
. bringt". Hence, it is not clear whether circulating a virus (i.e. a
means destined for unauthorized modification of data) will be an offense,
or only unauthorized circulation of a virus will constitute an offense.

Whether the proposed rule is sensible, is beyond the scope of this
contribution.

The October 18th issue of Aviation Week has an interesting item in its
Washington Outlook column on future developments in electronic warfare.
Paraphrase follows:

  A Pentagon official, H. Steven Kimmel, deputy director of C3I testing
  and evaluation in the Pentagon acquisition office, said the next
  developments in "non-lethal electronic combat" should be on methods
  of injecting deceptive information and computer viruses into enemy
  command, control, communication and intelligence systems and into
  enemy communication nodes and data bases. Kimmel was speaking to the
  Association of Old Crows, a group of electronic warfare specialists.
  He further said that the U.S. needs this "nonlethal capability" both
  defensively and offensively. It was pointed out that American C3I
  systems are vulnerable because of their many nodes and reliance on
  computers and commercial off the shelf components.

Your comments on patents are interesting. I hold several software
patents; they cost me a LOT of money, but the rewards I have
received from holding these patents have not, in my opinion,
paid for those expenses. I think I would have had pretty much
the same income from my software with or without those patents.
The expenses, however, continue. I frequently lament ever having
applied for my software patents. I KNOW my patent attorneys
are glad I did; they saw a LOT of money as a result. Is anybody
else benefitting from software patents besides patent attorneys?

David is correct here and as I recall (and am sure Fred will correct
me if wrong), Dr. Cohen's first virus experiments were conducted on a
VAX 11/750 running Ultrix.

There are a couple of caveats though, First, UNIX actively uses
checksum and header flags which would have to be circumvented.
Secondly, most system executables are set to 644 which means that root
privilege is necessary to write and this is much more difficult to
change than the "read-only" flag in DOS. Thirdly, not that many people
have UNIX boxes at home to play with. Fourthly, UNIX runs on many
different platforms and usually must be recompiled for each. Finally,
is is easier and just as effective under UNIX to write a worm as it is
to write a virus (there are a lot of reasons for this last one - too
many to go into here).

[Moderator's nitpick: Actually, most UNIX executables are set to 755,
not 644 (or else they wouldn't include the _execute_ bit.]

The famous "Morris Worm" targeted just two specific platforms -
VAX/Ultrix and SUN, eploiting a number of "known" weaknesses.

So the good news is that viruses are unlikely but possible. On the
other hand, a worm under Unix is both likely AND possible. A directed
attack against a given installation using a limited number of
platforms is both likely and possible. And, as I have been saying for
years, integrity management, possibly coupled with limited
functionality workstations (does every workstation *need* a C compiler
?) is what is necessary.

David M. Chess,

Your comment regarding the possibility of UNIX viruses seems to ignore
the REAL difference between UNIX & DOS. Most viruses are transmitted
either through infected disks or infected executables.

When is the last time you copied an executable from one UNIX machine
onto another one? This is not a characteristic mode of usage for UNIX
activity.  Usually, programs are recompiled when being ported to
another machine.

[Moderator's nitpick: Happens all the time on the NFS LAN that I'm
on...]

How often do you transfer data between UNIX machines by carrying a
floppy disk from machine to machine? Usually, UNIX machines are on
some kind of network and data is transferred electronically.

Consequently, there is, as of yet, no reliable indication of rather or
not UNIX access control is helpful. As a competent UNIX sysop will
protect executables from modification by users, it seems likely that a
much higer level of skill will be required to effectively propagate
viruses on UNIX.

In any event, if you have access to a UNIX machine, you probably are
too busy doing something interesting to have time for virus writing.

But that "most" can be a killer.  On a typical Unix machine that
has at least a few developers and/or gurus on it, there will be
a significant number of cases where someone (not root) has
execute access to programs that someone else (not root) has
write access to.  A virus can spread along this sort of
link until it gets to someone who is root, and at that point
all bets are off.

Consider a rewording of your question into the PC area:
> Doesn't the lack of networking greatly limit the potential for spread

> golden-build machine in order to get really widely distributed.

Well, sure.  But if it can spread slowly through contacts between
people who aren't building Golden Masters, it may eventually get
to a Golden Master machine, at which point baf it's shipped to
thousands of machines world-wide.  Happens all the time, sadly.
No particular reason the analogous thing couldn't happen under
Unix, if the cultural sharing patterns were right.

Sharing patterns allow viruses to spread between PCs, despite
the fact that most PCs aren't networked to each other.  Sharing
patterns in the future could allows viruses to spread between
Unix (etc) accounts and machines, despite the fact that there
are access controls in place.  Seems plausible, anyway!

Yes, the only Monkey infection I've seen so far was caused by a student
who put her "data disk" into the drive before switching on the machine.
Form, V-Sign and Parity_Boot.B keep appearing every now and again for the
same reason. That's why we let F-Prot do a full scan on power-up.

No it can't. Unless someone writes a Monkey dropper, that is. However,
according to Tim Martin, the author of KILLMONK, Monkey will also infect
the second physical hard disk (81h) as soon as it accessed.

BTW, has anyone tried to save the original MBR to a floppy with Monkey
active in memory? Are there any stealth MBR infectors which smell a rat
if you try this?

The key here is "scanners". Integrity management software will spot it
immediately (my FreeWare CHKMEM will spot it instantly in memory using
a check added in 1990 - doesn't even require memory size input).

Second, much of the code is crude & IMHO at least two people wrote pieces.

The code owes much to the 4096/Whale but, as in any infection, there are
actually three problems involved:
a) Identification when resident in memory - easy - faulty/obvious mechanism
   used.
b) Identification in programs - relatively easy (a simple heuristic will
   find it at the expense of a few possible false positives, checksum will
   detect immediately).
c) Removal from infected programs - relatively difficult due to the
   encryption used but expect the algorithm not to be terribly difficult.
   For the moment, easiest from backups.

There are two things here that I think I disagree with:

  - Essentially all reputable scanners, including IBM AntiVirus
    and the ones you mention in your posting, include some form
    of heuristic detection, even if it's only a certain amount
    of new-variant detection.  IBMAV, for instance, does fuzzy
    matching on its virus signatures, warns of files that have
    been suspiciously changed, and has an optional TSR that
    applies heuristic rules to warn of viral-looking activity.
    These are all heuristic approaches.

  - I think that when you say "heuristics" you mean the specific
    technique of statically looking at the semantics of a program
    on disk, and deciding whether or not it looks viral in some
    respect?  If that's what you mean, I don't agree that it's
    proven to be the best method of virus detection.  Could you
    give some detail on why you think so?  If done well, it can
    be reasonably good at detecting brand-new viruses, but it
    also tends to be prone to false alarms.  The heuristic
    scanners that we've looked at have had false alarm rates
    in the .1% to 1% range; this is far too high.  Accusing
    5-50 innocent files on a 5,000-file server of being infected
    would not make you very popular with a typical LAN admin!  *8)

    Even F-PROT, which has a good set of heuristics, doesn't
    use them by default (at least last time I looked), because
    of this very problem.  There are some environments where a
    high rate of false positives is bearable, but a typical
    end-user workstation or LAN server isn't among them, at
    least in our experience.

When evaluating a scanning method, it's vital to look not just
at how often it says "Yep!" at a virus, but how often it
wrongly says "Yep!" at an innocent file.  If you want a program
that's *very good* at detecting brand-new viruses, and you don't
mind a high false positive rate, I recommend the following:

     printf("The file %s is infected!!\n",argv1Y);

Sorry, but "KEYPRESS 5" is not enough to provide accurate identification.
At the moment I know of the following variants:

    1215                   1215/1455 bytes
    1228                   1228/1468 bytes

    2728                   2728/2984 bytes

A total of 16 variants...whatever CPAV identifies as "KEYPRESS 5" is
probably one of them, but without information on the virus size I
cannot tell which one it is.

I believe TBAV 6.08 is out. You might want to check it on the EsaSS BBS

Well, I obviously cannot speak for those companies, but I'll give you
a few reasons....pick any one you like :-)

    Heuristics can be very good for finding "new" viruses, but they
    have one serious problem -  they tend to cause false alarms.  This
    is not a problem if the users have a certain level of knowledge,
    but it is a problem if your customer base includes a large number
    of novices.

    The term "THE best method of virus detection" can mean different
    things to different people, and a very large number of users don't
    really care how good their scanner is at detecting unknown viruses,
    just as long as they detect those that they might get hit by.  If
    there is no pressure from your customers, why bother ?

    The companies may provide an integrity checker - which enables them
    to claim that they will detect all new viruses too ... hence no need
    for heuristics.

    They did not buy us :-)

This is bogus.  THere is little to no way to make this claim.  It

Bytes, not bits.  I'm not sure of the exact sizes, but there are very large

What?

If you are talking about biological parasites, I'll not comment.

If you are talking about computer "parasites" as aforementioned, then a
- --virus-- with a host file, which is described by Patricia as being
"Parasitic", can "live" just as long as a .Germ can.  (Theoretically,
a .Germ could be viewed as having infected a previously constructed host
file, anyways.)  What about multi-partite viruses?  They infect files,
but don't need host files in order to replicate.  Do you consider a
companion virus a file infector?  They create files.

NAV 3.0 detects all TPE samples from the currently existing versions,
and Satan Bug.

They have a very powerful system of virus identification which does not
make it very difficult to detect some of the less polymorphic viruses,
but, ones which would normally take a little bit of work to detect.

This system also allows them to send out updates which contain enough
information to detect even complicated polymorphs, such as TPE, or MtE,
if the need becomes necessary.

NAV 3.0 detects Girafe (TPE) using a method I call "Encypted search."
That is, we know what it looks like in its unencrypted form.  Encrypt it
to match any particular "morph".  Then search.

SatanBug (Sbug, Sat-Bug) is easy to detect.  The concern over SatanBug is
with the speed it infects and it's not easy to recover/repair an infected
file (it is recoverable through NAV 3.0's Inoculation feature).  And because
it was new, if you didn't have a sig in your scanner for this guy, you spread
the virus by invoking a scan.  So, the issue over SatanBug is not that it's
hard to detect but rather 1) it was new, 2) it spreads fast, and 3) no easy
"repair" function.  It was hard to detect only in the sense that, at the time,
few products had a signature yet.  But now, most do.  Check with your
particular vendor.  (NAV 3.0 has it.  NAV 2.1 requires the August 93 def set,
or later.)

Now to break to a tangent and also address a previous message about
Heuristics being "proven to be THE best method of virus detection..."
(quote from Data Disruptor, aka Chris Atkinson (?)).

I'll just state simply, proven by whom? since it's obviously not true.

The best way to detect a virus infection is through integrity checking.
If a correctly done check says nothing is changing on your machine, you
don't have a virus.  If something changed, and now a bunch of your other
executables are changing but you're unaware that anything should have
changed, best to be careful because you probably have a virus.

NAV 3.0 calls its integrity checking, Inoculation.  With all the viruses
you listed (MtEs, TPEs, SatanBug), Inoculation can detect AND REPAIR
everyone of them.  That's why the default settings for NAV 3.0 is to
"Inoculate Automatically."

The difference between integrity checking and scanning is that scanning
identifies particular virus strains.  Integrity checking just says,
"Hey it changed!  Did you do it on purpose?"

As for having no Heuristics, that's an ignorant statement.  We all have some
kind of heuristics.  McAfee's most well known is GENP and GENB.  Those are
heuristic definitions.  Fprot is more well known because they make it blatant.
NAV 3.0 has some heuristic definitions also.  We just don't make it obvious.
With NAV 3.0, we want to push the Inoculation technology.  (I have no
information about CPAV.)

Chris:

Heuristics are good for analyzing new programs before running them. BUT
Heuristics is not the best way to detect viruses.

Heuristics is not an exact science. Heuristics will miss viruses, amd will
falsely report some clean files as infected. Perhaps you should read some of
my reports of viruses that aren't detected with scanners or heuristics. You
shouldn't have any difficulty in finding some of them in the back issues of
VIRUS-L.

Subject: NetShield Quest: Which Config. File? (PC)

Greetings.
Problem: McAfee Associates' NETSHLD.NLM, on my Netware 3.11 server is not doing
the period scan at the time I want.  Server time is accurate.  The netshld
screen tells me:
"Next period scan: Every day at 03:00"
But the netshld console logging tells me, every morning for a week now (since
installed on our test net, basically), that scanning commenced at 04:00.
Question: How can I tell the path and filename of the current configuration fil
e?  I know where the one I *think* is being used resides.  I haven't found any
others using "NDIR".  Is this even my problem?
Thanks for *any* input.

This information is quite a bit out of date.  There are not four known
variants, but at least eight: 584, 690, 768, 800, two 855, 880 and 1007

Somebody seems to be developing the new variants faster that the information

First - Dudley is polymorphic....no signatures are possible.  Second, the
virus is not very new, and many scanners will detect it without problems...
at least the current F-PROT does.
