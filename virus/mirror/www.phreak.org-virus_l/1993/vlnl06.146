Subject: re: Draft Swiss AntiVirus regulation

In broad terms, the draft Swiss law appears to create two
offences: the unauthorised modification of data, and the
provision of means for the unauthorised modification of data.

In defining any criminal offence under English law there are
always two aspects - what the criminal does and what he had in
mind when he did it ("mens rea"). Accordingly, the Computer
Misuse Act (which covers hacking and viruses) specifies not
only the nature of the offence (as apparently does the draft
Swiss law), but also defines what constitutes requisite intent
for an offence to be committed and the requisite knowledge to
determine whether the action was unauthorised. Does the draft
Swiss law really say nothing about requisite intent and
requisite knowledge?

One other potential legal problem is rarely discussed. Under
English laws of evidence facts contained in a computer generated
document can be used in a prosecution only where there are
reasonable grounds for believing that the computer was operating
properly. Fine, but it automatically restricts what computer
generated material is valid about a virus infection and how it
can be used in evidence. Do prosecutors in other countries face
similar restrictions, and what is the practical effect?

That is the entire reason for a variety of restrictions that are
applied to the root account.  The PATH doesn't include the current
directory, root access is stripped from remote use of NFS file
servers, etc.   For a vrius to be executed by root, typically the root
user would have to explicitly give the entire path of the infected
file.  Not impossible, but also not typical in a well-managed
installation.

The secondary path of infection is the more likely one (non-system
programs), but generally that sort of stuff is recompiled from source
code frequently.

The system software is owned by either root or bin, and not writable
by normal users.  Major software packages such as Oracle usually
require a special user to be created to own the software, but access
to that user account has the same restrictions as root/bin.

Obviously, this doesn't apply to user programs, but typical Unix
installation have very few user programs that are executed by anyone
other than the user that created them.

However, my article about the MtE detection tests compares -equally-
outdated versions of the anti-virus products. Therefore, when saying
that e.g., CPAV did detect at least some of the MtE-based viruses
reliably, while NAV didn't detect any, I meant the versions of the
programs that I had at the time of the tests. In this particular case,
it was CPAV 1.3 and NAV 2.1, which is clearly mentioned in the
article, BTW, if you bother to read it.

If you mean that the data in my article is outdated, I have to agree,
with two corrections. First, if a product achieves reliable detection
once, I don't see the need to test any future versions. Of course,
there is the small chance that the product will worsen, but I don't
think that just because of that I must repeat the tests (which are
rather slow to do, BTW) with each new version of each of the products.
Unless, of course, I get some evidence that the product -has- worsen
in this aspect. For istance, there have been some reports about SCAN
being unable to detect reliably CoffeeShop:MtE, so I might redo the
tests for this virus.

Second, I obviously cannot test a product that I don't have. In this
particular case, I have not seen NAV 3.0 and cannot test it.

Otherwise you are correct that my MtE detection test data needs
updating. I have newer versions of at least four of the scanners that
failled to achive 100% reliable detection. I have also significantly
new versions of some of the other scanners, which are worth checking
to see whether the detection is still as reliable as it was the last
time I looked.

Regards,
Vesselin

P.S. OK, I realized that the phrase "there are some reports about SCAN
not detecting reliably one of the MtE-based viruses" doesn't sound
very well, so I re-did the tests only for SCAN 108 and CoffeeShop.
Result: the reports were TRUE!!! SCAN is no longer able to detect
reliably this particular MtE-based virus (it used to be). In
particular, it detected ONLY the unencrypted replicants of it! In
practice, this means 1,852 missed replicants out of 2,000!!! I guess,
McAfee Associates have goofed up something again... :-(

This seems as if you g\could get into some pretty deep crapola if someone

Subject: Text File With Portion of Form Code (PC)

We've recently had a rash of Form virus infections (discoverd
by F-Prot 2.09f). On one particular PC, I went through the
usaully procedure of cold boot with a write protected disk
containing F-Prot and disinfect the hard disks and all of the
user's floppy disks - F-Prot reported no troubles removing the
virus. I cold booting again (this time from the hard drive).
I ran F-Prot and it reported no problems.

Later in the day, the user went to retrieve a large WordPerfect
file. Only half appeared. One of our staff looked at the file
with a sector editor and found the text portion of the Form
virus and, I believe (not sure) part of the code. Needless
to say I'm a little puzzled. Anyone experience anything similar
with Form or any other virus? Does anyone have any clues as to
the cause?

The PC is a CompuAdd 386 with 4MB RAM, 130MB hard disk, DOS
version 5.0, normal TSRs - mouse.sys, ansi.sys, AT&T packet
driver.

BTW, F-Prot was used on at least 12 other infected computers
covering at least 20 total infections fo Form without a hitch,
so I don't think that it had anything to do with F-Prot.

Thanks in advance!

It's likely Stoned.Empire.Monkey.  The partition table isn't "corrupted
in a very short time", it is encoded and moved into a hiding place when
the virus infects the computer.  I can infer though that you used
either FDISK /MBR or some other tool to fix the MBR code, and then
discovered the computer wouldn't boot, then discovered that it is because
your partition table is messed up.  I recommend you get KillMonk 3.0 from
ftp.srv.ualberta.ca, in pub/dos/virus.   And let me know if the program
works!  :)

It does not scramble the original location, rather what you see there
is a part of the virus' code.

Make sure you also do something to rebuild the boot code of the MBR
as well.  Remember an MBR has two important parts: the boot program
and the partition table.  Monkey is a bit of a nuisance because it
changes both, while most MBR infectors leave the partition table
alone.

The sys wasn't needed for Monkey, but is for Form.  However you must
do something like FDISK /MBR to get the clean Master Boot Record
program written into place.

Another alternative is to get KillMonk version 3 from ftp.srv.ualberta.ca,
in the file pub/dos/virus/killmnk3.zip

If you are a lab manager, I strongly suggest you also look into
Padgett's Disk Secure II.

I don't know of a PD solution, but there is a commercial product known
as RxDOS, whose source code can be licensed (if its producers are still
in business!).

I kept the UseNet announcement, -part- of which is reproduced below my

    Introduction

        Api created RxDOS, a real time disk operating system to meet its
        requirements in delivering embedded DOS applications which often
        required multitasking and multiprocessing.   RxDOS  needed to be
        fully compliant with  Microsoft's  MSDOS.   RxDOS 5.0  is  fully
        compatible with MSDOS 5.0

        Api is publishing RxDOS in source listing form.  The source code
        listing is annotated with comments on how DOS structures relate,
        on how DOS treats networked versus local drives, and on  undocu-
        mented DOS calls that are also supported in RxDOS.

        For example, there is the undocumented  DOS  function 65h  (sub-
        function 20h) that upper cases a character based  on the current
        code  page  and  country  settings.    Or  the  undocumented DOS
        function 60h which validates a path for the  requested device by
        correctly checking the media for removable  disk media.   All of
        these features are in RxDOS  and  they are  highlighted  in  the
        RxDOS source listing.

well, readers of perhaps pro-virus magazines, such as the infamous NuKE
info-journal issue #7, had a VERY interesting article concerning the
heuristic use of ThunderByte's AntiVirus' package.

the _terrible_ bug, was with the TBCLEAN.EXE utility, this program which is
available in all version of TBAV, claims to be able to clean viruses, without
any needed information on the virus. basically it will set up an environment
that will actually _execute_ the virus-infected file to be cleaned! Now my
_greatist_ fear is if TBCLEAN is unable to "handle" the virus, the virus can
get out of hand and go resident and start infecting the computer!!!

and one person (Rock Steady) developed a virus called "Varicella" this virus
did exactly the above! meaning if I gave you a file (anyfile) infected with
the Varicella virus, and if you tried to clean this virus infected file with
tbclean, what would actual happen is that tbclean will report "that this file
is not infected by a virus" but what _actually_ happen was that the virus
escaped the controlled environment that tbclean setup to try to disinfect the
file, and the virus will go resident and hook interrupts 21h,13h,8h,1ch. and
it will allocate memory under the TOM, and fool tbclean in reporting that no
virus is in the file, and tbclean will exit normally!

whereby, infact the varicella virus went resident and is now infecting the
system. and to advice you, the varicella virus is fairly a stealth virus that
disinfects files on the file, when opened and reinfects them when closed,
and it hides its virus length very well! such a virus can easily get out of
control on a huge level. all because we trusted heuristic scanning!

because tbclean, actually tries to remove viruses from the infect file by
executing the virus, with the help of the int 1 & 3. makes this method
very dangerous to use! as shown to you by mr. rock steady of Nuke.

so before you think "heuristic" is the best method of scanning/cleaning
think again! the rate of false positives is WAY TOO HIGH! and remember that
the average computer user is not a geniusssis

it is better to be 100%, than 99% because that 1% can cause quite a bit of
damage, if we disreguard it!

heuritics may have a future, but not for a while, not till it is perfected!

Subject: Scanning below the DOS level (PC)

In a recent article it was suggested that anti-virus programs might
go below DOS and scan at the sector level, and there have been several
follow-ups downplaying this idea.

They have all made that point that it would require a great deal of
work (although it's really just a SMOP :) and that what with reading
the directory and interpreting the FAT, it would be much slower than
just using file handles and opening the file through DOS.  (One wonders
how DOS manages to do it *without* reading the directory and interpreting
the FAT.)

If implemented well, it would *not* be slower than going through DOS,
but it would be a hell of a lot of trouble to write, and it would mean
reinventing the wheel in a very big way, and for these reasons I don't
think it's practical.

But one major reason for not scanning at the sector level, the most
important reason IMNSHO, hasn't been mentioned.  Any scanner which did
this would lose compatibility with future DOS versions, or with other
environments (OS/2, Windows NT, UN*X DOS boxen) which emulate DOS.  A
program which opens and reads a file via handles and standard calls will
be able to do so under DOS 8.21, even if it uses something like HPFS.
Any program which tries to redo DOS will get hopelessly confused and fail,
I hope gracefully, at worst it may fail catastrophically.

Of course, someone might reply that scanners are updated so frequently
that a new update would follow close on the heels of any major change in
the DOS filesystem, and a scanner could check the DOS version (but what of
SETVER?)  But we're still talking about a huge amount of work for the
anti-viral developers (who receive several new viruses per day) and a
great loss of compatability, plus a drastic increase in code complexity
and the certainty of many new, bizarre and difficult-to-fix bugs.

All this, to get past stealth viruses.  Well, there's already a simple
way to do that.  Boot from a known clean, write-protected floppy.

Considering the problems found in sector-level scanning and the easy
alternative which already exists, it just isn't worth it.

Subject: VIRSTOP.EXE and 386max memory manager.... (PC)

Hi everyone,

	I have been using frisk's virstop.exe for sometime now and would not
want to consider other TSR for my virus prevention measures but I have
encounter the following problem and would like to ask those knowledgable souls
out there might help me with it.

	I recently upgrade to DOS 6.0 mainly for it's multiconfig and
integration with disk compression utility.... I am using Stacker 3.1... :)
	Anyway, I also bought the new version of 386Max version 7.0.... before
that I was using version 6.01d fine... even under DOS 6.0 everything works
fine.... I load only a parallel port to scsi driver and disk cache and VIRSTOP.
	When 7.0 is installed and runs.... VIRSTOP would hang the computer on
activation... sometimes, would hang after the prompt comes on and a few key
strokes.... I have realized that from their readme.txt that VIRSTOP is not
compatible with 386max and there is no known solution to it....
	What curious me was that why 6.01d handles it like a brisk but 7.0
would no?  I know that there might be some significant changes... but it
really bugs me.... I might return the product unless someone can help me solve
the problem.....
	Thanks very much in advance for any tips and advice you can give.

Has anyone encounter the following error message from SCAN?

  Sorry, I need more RAM memory
  390 kbytes should be enough

Is it some kind of bug in SCAN?  I am quite sure I have more than 500 kbytes

standalone machines, and also when I tried to scan the network.

Anyone knows the problem please enlighten me.  Thks.
The error occurs sometimes before checking of RAM for viruses, sometimes in

Subject: Tremor detection tests planned (PC)

Hello, everybody!

Here, at the VTC-Hamburg, we indend to perform tests of the ability of
the different scanners to detect Tremor - a very polymorphic virus,
which is very widespread in the wild in Germany. We will perform those
tests much in the same was as we did with the MtE detection tests.

However, one of the arguments against our testing procedure was that
we have not announced our intention to perform those tests in advance,
and have not done our best to aquire the latest versions of the
different scanners.

This argument is valid and we intend to correct this mistake of ours
this time. Therefore, this is a public announcement of our intention
to preform the tests, and a statement of which scanners (and which
particular versions of them) we currently have. If some producer of
anti-virus scanning software is reading this and feels that we are not
using the "right" version of his product, or have completely
forgotten about the existence of his product, he is welcome to inform
us how to obtain the appropriate version of it. Also, if you notice
some spelling mistakes in the names of the products or the companies
that produce them, please inform me. I apologize in advance for them.

I would like to note that we will perform extensive static detection
tests (one and the same set of 4,000 Tremor replicants will be used),
as well as limited disinfection tests (on a subset of 400 samples from
the previous set).

The products that we currently have and intend to use are the
following. Please note that some of them might not be the latest
versions, and some are beta versions. This is not important - the
important is whether their producers feel that those versions have
the capability to detect/disinfect Tremor reliably. No other
properties of the products will be tested, although if annoying bugs
and misfeatures are found, they will be mentioned, just like we did
with the report about the MtE detection.

Scanner name:   Version:        Producer:

Notes:

1) Those companies for which no country is listed, are either
international, or USA-based.

2) The version of CPAV is marked "special edition for Vesselin
Bontchev" - it's made specially for me and has one feature not present
in the "normal" versions - it is able to list all files being scanned
in the report file (not only those that it thinks are infected). This
is necessary for me, in order to automate the proprocessing of the
reported results.

3) The version of F-Prot is beta - don't ask where to get it.

4) NAV is updated with the virus definitions for November '93,
available from our ftp site.

He cannot use the floppy drive (A:, 3 1/2). Every time that he boot the

s on his computer, and the floppy drive is not functionally (even I change the
setup configuration, when I reboot, the virus change other time the configurati
on). How could I kill this virus?

Subject: Monkey, Int_10 and (ANNOUNCING) KillMonk 3.0 (PC)

Announcing KillMonk v3.0
- ------------------------
KillMonk is a program for finding and removing the Monkey and Int_10
viruses from hard disks and diskettes.   I wrote the first version of
KillMonk because the Monkey viruses are atypically tricky to remove
from a hard disk, and few (at that time none) of the popular anti-viral
software packages did the job well.

I had hoped that by now KillMonk would be obsolete, but instead the
Monkey virus has spread worldwide, and most anti-virals still can't
properly deal with the virus. I'm getting regular electronic mail
messages from people frustrated by the limitations of the original
KillMonk program.  Three kinds of 'failures' were most common: first,
the program couldn't remove Monkey if the computer user had first
tried to clean things up using FDISK/MBR or some disk sector editor.
Second, it couldn't clean the virus off second hard drives.  Third,
it apparently failed in some cases to remove Monkey.B from some
computers.

Meantime, the Int_10  viruses have been seen on computers in my
neighborhood, and they are (as far as I know) undetected by popular
anti-viral software.  They have their own quirks to make things
difficult for the general anti-viral software writers. So it seemed
time to upgrade the KillMonk program.

New since Version 1
- ------------------
1.  KillMonk 3.0 cleans Monkey from a second hard drive.

2.  KillMonk 3.0 properly recognizes whether MS Windows is running, and
    refuses to run if it is.  (The virus search and cleaning process
    doesn't work if Windows is running.)

3.  KillMonk 3.0 cleans the Int_10 viruses as well.

4.  Earlier versions of KillMonk failed when users first tried to
    clean Monkey-infected computers using FDISK /MBR or general
    disk repair tools.  KillMonk 3.0 should be able to clean such
    computers successfully.

5.  KillMonk 3.0 should properly clean computers that have less
    than 640k conventional memory.  I haven't been able to test
    this, though.

Availability
- ------------
Killmonk 3.0 is available via ftp at ftp.srv.ualberta.ca, in
the file pub/dos/virus/killmnk3.zip.  A small text manual, and
technical notes on Monkey and Int_10 are included with the
package.  I'm not a mail server, but if you can't do ftp, but
do know how to use uudecode, then I might find time to email
KillMonk 3.0 to you, if you ask nicely.  :)

BEGPANI.CVP  931005

                           DON'T PANIC!

If this was the Hitchiker's Guide to Viral Programs, that would be
in large, friendly red letters.  Most books dealing with what to do
about an infection tell you not to panic.  Unfortunately, most of
them seem to assume that you are reading at leisure, in advance, in
time to prepare for the disaster to come.  They don't tell you much
of what to do when you actually *are* in trouble, unprepared, and
have bought the book in a panic to find out what to do.

The following section is going to be a sort of question and answer
template for what to do if caught unprepared.  This is far from
perfect.  Ideally, this should be a sort of hypertext situation
where you could follow a flowchart and get help at any point.  Given
this is text, the help will have to be included all the way along.
As soon as you get the idea of one item, you can skip any remaining
text and skip to the bottom of the item to find out where to go
next.

Again ideally, there should be a clear "if yes, go to 5.3; if no, go
to 5.4" type of progression through the questions.  Because it is
impossible to foresee all of the many situations you might be in,
the path may get a bit fuzzy at times.  For starters, I don't even
know what computer you have, or what operating system you are using.
Therefore, this guide will have to be very generic.  At many points
the direction is going to have to be, "If you don't understand this,
get some etra help from your friends/user group/support staff".

If you are comfortable with getting, and using, utility software
from BBSes, then you will probably be able to follow this guide all
the way through.  I don't mean to imply that you *will* be going and
geting utility software with a modem, but that "comfort level"
indicates the kind of technical level people are at.  You may need
to use utility software at some point:  it makes no difference
whether it is shareware, commercial or came with the operating
system.  However, just because you own a commercial utility package
doesn't mean you always know what it does.  If you have doubts, call
someone you know who is comfortable at that level and have them go
over the guide with you.

Please have them go through the guide with you.  There are an awful
lot of people out there who think they know a lot about computers.
Trouble is, most of them do - but that doesn't guarantee that they
know anything about viral programs.  I once worked with a very
capable technical support person.  He was one of the first in the
city to get a "dual boot" OS/2 and MS-DOS system working.  He
thought he was hot stuff - and, generally, he was.  He thought my
"expertise" in viral programs was interesting but a bit pointless
. until the day he had to ask me to clean his system.  He'd
infected himself while trying to clean up someone else.
