Subject: Virus/gun analogy doesn't work

Most virus writers I have met are fairly cunning people.  I think that
if an argument is to be made to validate the writing of viruses, the
'gun' analogy must go.  A more 'cunning' argument is needed.

The problem is this: You must have a *license* to sell guns, and you
must have a *license* to buy guns.  Taking that into consideration,
the argument then becomes:

'If I was a *certified* gunsalesperson [politically correct, I guess],
and I *legally* sold a gun to someone who was *legally* entitled to
use one, and they shot somebody with it, I cannot be charged for their
wrongdoing.'

This is still true, but, put this into virus terms, and we have a
problem.

'If I was a *certified* virus-writer, and I *legally* sold a virus to
someone who was *legally* ... '   The finish isn't necessary.  It is
painfully obvious that this argument needs revision.

How about if I 'legally installed', ummm, 'legally spread'.  This just
doesnt' work for me.

Please don't flame me for this message, as I am not stating any 'for'
or 'against' views on virus writing.  I am simply stating my opinion
on a heavily flawed, and overused analogy.

Well, that is your opinion - I know a few people that would disagree with you.
However - this analogy is no good, as the sale and distribution of weapons
is considered "acceptable" in most "civilized" societies.

Assume instead that you have invented a new type of poiseon, nerve gas or
a biological virus - something that most people would agree that unauthorized
persons should not be playing around with or creating..

Then, yes....I would say it was certainly your responsibility to make sure
it did not fall into the wrong hands, and if it did, then some people would
certainly like to hold you personally responsible.

>And we all know that there is a few CARO virus collections floating

We do ?   Unfortuantely, there is no such thing as a "CARO virus collection".
There are several different collections in existense - some of which happen
to be owned by a caro member.  If you have any evidence any of those
collections are "floating around in the wrong places", please prove that - or
consult a lawyer before you make claims like this again. (This does not mean
that there have never been "leaks" from the research community to the
"underground"...but they seem (fortunately) to be a thing of the past).

>You are assuming something that can NOT be proven: Computer viruses
>are inherently destructive.  This is false;

It is ?  Please prove it.

By my definition, a computer virus has to modify something in order to spread.
The modified object may no longer work properly - so even if the virus is
intended to be harmless, that is unfortunately never the case.

First, I didn't use the word "allow". I just said "maybe". Second,
using your brain to figure out or imagine something is one thing and
judging something that you don't know just on the basis of your
immagination is a completely different thing, especially when it
concerns technical matters. Third, this discussion has run completely
out of topic and I propose you to take it to private e-mail.

Subject: Another false positive with SCAN (PC)

Hello, everybody!

SCAN 9.20 V109, when used with the /A option, reports the program
MODE.COM from the German version of MS-DOS 3.30 as containing the
"1008-B Dropper [1008Drop] Virus". This is a false positive; the
program is not infected.

I am not certain what exactly causes the false positive - the program
looks pretty normal. You should avoid using the /A option, unless an
infection is found in "normal" mode.

A copy of the file causing the false positive has been sent to McAfee
Associates.

Stop! Wait a moment! I found a bug in Moctezuma removing procedure. It
can cause incorrect restoring CS and SS fields in EXE header in some
cases.  Next update (next week, I hope) will disinfect all curable
viruses (including polymorphic MtE, TPE, Tremor ....) without errors.

BTW, in some cases Moctezuma encrypts original EXE header fields
(which are stored in virus body) incorrectly. These files are not
curable :-(

Please, please keep in mind that MSAV is incompatible with other anti-virus
programs, in particular F-PROT (which is a bit paranoid about searching
memory for viruses).   MSAV simply leaves a fragment of the virus in memory,
which F-PROT later finds.  This is an old and well-known false alarm.

Subject: HELP! Filler/Swedish Disaster Attack. (PC)

      I need some help.  Yesterday when I started up my office machine
    VI-SPY detected two viruses FILLER and SWEDISH DISASTER.  I checked the
    machine with SCAN109, it told me I had the FILLER virus but didn't say
    anything about SWEDISH DISASTER.  Both programs told be to boot with
    a clean disk and rescan.  I did this and rescaned but both programs
    failed to detect ANY viruses.  When I start the machine from the
    hard disk I get the virus warnings again.

      Can anybody tell me anything about these two viruses.  I printed out
    the scan109 virus list text file and SWEDISH DISASTER isn't on the list.
    VISPY may call it SWEDISH DISASTER but what does SCAN call it?  Why
    aren't these viruses detected when I boot from a clean floppy and
    scan my hard drive.  How can I get rid of these viruses.   Windows
    no longer runs on my machine and I don't know if it's related to these
    viruses or not.   Any help will be appreciated.

Subject: Inconsistent virus reporting (PC)

I recently purchased some pre-formatted 3.5 diskettes, I believe that they
were 3M brand, but can't be sure right this second, and I saved a
spreadsheet file from my home machine to the diskette.  When I took the
diskette to the office the next day, and tried to load the file at
work, I got a warning from the virus software that the diskette was
infected with the 'Form virus'.  The virus protection software that I use
at home is F-prot, and I have always used the latest versions direct from
the net since I found it roughly eighteen months ago. The virus
protection that we use on the office net is Norton. Why wasn't the virus
detected on my home machine when I initially saved the file , and is
this a false alarm from Norton, even tho' it said it 'repaired' the disk
when I answered yes to the prompt?  Anybody have a clue as to what's going
on? Any assist would be appreciated!!

Hello all,

Quick question.  Will the newer version of FDISK (the one that includes

We've gotten hit with the new stoned that can't be cleaned yet and are
considering that as one of several options to get around the problem.

This false alarm turned out to have been caused by Scan finding
our procedure to find Invisible Man, despite the fact that the
only connection between it and the virus was that the same two
constants appeared in each, in the same order.

We have taken steps to further camouflage this section, and
this false alarm will no longer occur.  A copy of VET 7.52,
containing this change, was sent to Manchester on Nov 26th.

Subject: New version of stoned virus & DOS 3.3 (PC)

We have been hit with a new version of stoned (detected with f-prot 2.10).
Unfortunatedly, f-prot is unable to disinfect it.  I tried using DOS 5.0
fdisk /mbr, but received the expected wrong dos version error (the computer
is a 286 running DOS 3.3).

Deleting the partitions leaves the virus in the MBR.  I used Norton's disk
editor and entered the generic master boot record as suggested in the User's
Guide, but the virus still remains.

Do you know how to get this virus out of the MBR?
Thanks.

Subject: Any reviews of InVircible/V-Care ? (PC)

We have recently been approached by someone selling InVircible by NetZ
Computing Ltd. of Israel. I understand that this product was previously
marketed as V-Care by CSA Interprint of Israel.

I am searching for a reputable review. The Virus Bulletin publication
from Great Britain hasn't reviewed it and there is only a passing
reference in an article about the virus/antivirus situation in Israel. I
can't find any reviews in various ftp archives. I have one review from
the Capital PC Monitor, the organ of the Capital PC User Group in
Washington DC USA, but would like something a bit weightier.

InVircible looks very attractive because it employs generic defences
against viral attack. Because it does not use scanning, it doesn't fall
into obsolescence. It boasts high speed, easy-of-use, inobtrusiveness,
and a high rate of restoration/disinfection.

Can the labelling on the package be believed?

As described in the documentation, VIRSTOP will not detect many polymorphic
viruses at all....I could change it to do so, but that would add nearly 100K
to the memory requirements, and slow it down considerably.

S-bug is quite polymorphic, so unfortunately VIRSTOP will not be of much help.
The scanner finds the virus 100% (as far as I know), but disinfection has
not yet been implemented.

: 5) The NOVELL NETX332.EXE for MS-DOS 6.0 had the same problem - not liking
:    the 6.20 version number. I just do not like SETVER - Note: of the
:    multi-screen default SETVER load, NONE of the entries were what I use.

: 6) HIMEM.SYS now has a lengthy (10+ seconds on 286 with 4 Mb extended) check
:    of extended memory but at least it tells you what it is doing.

: 7) As previously mentioned, no update to MSAV appeared to be performed
:    (files still dated 3-10-93)

: 8) Like on a full instalation, DELOLDOS will remove the "old" DOS directory
:    but does not remove the STEPUP directory - you'll have to do that manually.

: 9) Do not use DBLSPACE on this machine so have not tried as yet. SCANDISK is
:    nice but take a coffee break.

: 					Warmly,
: 						Padgett
Regarding (9):  I have been using MS-DOS 6.0 for several months now.
Recently, I upgraded to to MS-DOS 6.2 and have found no problems with
DoubleSpace or anything else (I have also used Dblspace for several
months.

Forutnately, I have not experience any of the problems stated above or
any others. (But my fingers are crossed...)

Subject: FreqList

 ===========================================================================
               Frequency of PC Viruses Confirmed in the Wild
                  Based on the December 1, 1993 WildList.
 ===========================================================================
   This list adds currency and frequency factors to the WildList. For the
   currency factor a base date of September 1, 1992 has been chosen. How
   often a virus has been reported (the frequency factor) is indicated by
   a number from 1 to 4 that represents a "feel" for how often each virus
   has been found in the wild. So far 6 of the WildList participants have
   provided their frequency information. Here are the frequency factors:
 ===========================================================================
   4=Very Frequent. 3=Fairly Frequent. 2=Barely Frequent. 1=Rarely found.
 ===========================================================================
   The 48 viruses listed below have a mean frequency of .5 or above. This
   means each virus has been found by at least three participants if the
   virus is rarely found, by two participants if one has found it on more
   occasions, or by one participant who has found it fairly often. Other
   viruses (50) on the WildList, found less frequently, are here omitted.
 ===========================================================================
   The section below gives the names of participants, along with their
   organization, antivirus product (if any), and geographic location.

 ============================================================================
                  PC Viruses in the Wild - December 1, 1993
 ============================================================================
    This is a cooperative listing of viruses reported as being in the wild
    by 14 virus information professionals. The basis for these reports are
    virus incidents where a sample was received, and positively identified
    by the participant.  Rumors and unverified reports have been excluded.
    The list should not be considered a list of "currently common" viruses
    however. No provision is made for currency or commonness. Therefore it
    should be viewed only as a report of viruses verified as in-the-wild.
 ============================================================================
    This list adds information provided from EliaShim and Virus Bulletin.
    A companion list includes frequency information from some participants.
 ============================================================================
    The section below gives the names of participants, along with their
    organization, antivirus product (if any), and geographic location.
