platform - diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant,
concise, polite, etc.  (The complete set of posting guidelines is
available by FTP on CERT.org or upon request.)  Please sign submissions
with your real name; anonymous postings will not be accepted.
Information on accessing anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue

Subject: Please respond -- law/ethics/viruses

These questions are being asked to help document how different people
perceive various aspects of the virus problem. Any and all responses
will be appreciated. It is not necessary to include any identifying
information, but you can if you wish. Affiliation/Position would be
appreciated, such as Virus Writer, Virus Exchange BBS Sysop, Virus
Collector, Professor of Law, Student of Psychology, etc.

I've asked these general questions before, so if you responded then, I
would still appreciate another response now. People change their ideas
on all of this from time to time, so I'm trying to get a current
perspective :)

Responses can be e-mailed via Fidonet 1:227/190, Internet vfr@netcom.com
or SGordon@Dockmaster.ncsc.mil, or Virnet 9:10/0. Paper mail responses
are also appreciated, at the address P.O. Box 11417 South Bend, Indiana

Thank you very much for the continued assistance so many of you have
given in the past!

1. Laws addressing computer viruses vary from location to location. Are
you familiar with the laws of your country? If so, can you tell me what
laws specifically address the virus problem? Please be as specific as
possible.

2. Do you know of anyone who has been prosecuted under any portion of
any law pertaining to computer viruses? If so, please give as much
detail as you know regarding charges, sentencing, recidivism, etc.

3. Are you familiar with the term 'incitement'? If so, how do you feel
about this portion of law that many countries are now adopting?

4. Please tell me how you view this statement. "If it is not illegal to
do it, it is ok to do it". Specifically, since it is legal in many
places to put viruses on a BBS for anyone to take, with no restrictions,
do you think this is an o.k. thing to do? Why or why not?

5. Please define "Responsible" behaviour relating to distribution of
viruses.

6. Please define "Computer Virus Researcher", paying special attention
to the term Researcher :). What is a researcher? What qualification and
responsibilities does a Researcher have?

7. What is the function of INTERPOL as you understand it?

8. Which branch of governments that you are aware of deal with computer
viruses, if any? This can be from your own country or from any country
that you are familiar with. What is the function of the branch/division
you are aware of.

9. Do you feel the trend in legislation against computer virus exchange
bbs will continue to grow? Do you think it is a healthy trend? What
possible implications do you see growing from the AIS Incident? Do you
feel the U.S. Government acted responsibly in allowing computer viruses
to be accessed from their BBS?

10. Do you think laws in other countries are applicable in cyberspace,
where there are no formal territorial boundaries?

11. Have you ever taken a class relating to ethics? If so, at what grade
level. Did the class specifically address ethical behaviours as relate
to computing environments? Please define the word "ethics", i.e. what
does this mean to you personally.

The source of all information will be publicly available unless you
specifically state you do NOT want your name used, so please, make sure
you specify if you do NOT want your name or any identifying information
used. If you do not want your name used, and say so :), any info you
give will be presented like "a virus writer from argentina" or
"professor of history from china", i.e., generic. If this is still too
broad for your liking, please specify to not include any reference to
you personally.

Laws are being tossed about daily, globally that could have far more
reaching impact than I ever realised. I am interested to know what other
people are thinking and doing to help stop this from happening.

Also, if you have a resource file, text file, paper, article, or any
information related to any of the above areas, I would appreciate
receiving a copy. Please circulate these questions to anyone and
anyplace you feel may have an interest in responding. Thanks :)

That seems to be true at the moment; not clear how long it'll
remain true, though.  Distribution in binary format is
becoming somewhat more common, I hear, and that's one of
the relevant vectors.  There's no technical feature of
Unix and related operating systems that keeps them from
getting viruses; it's just cultural features (less binary
virus exchange, apparently less people with both a UNIX
system and the proper sorts of brain-damage to want to
spread a virus, etc).            DC

We perform scans daly using Mcafee s/w on SUN UNIX systems
 as follows;

Unix side: We find and copy all NEW files to a restricted file area
we perform the copy in a manner which maintains a directory tree
to some degree, but changes the owner to Wheel user-id @ 600

We logon as that Wheel USER-ID
We then PC/NFS mount the area
    example net use g:  fs: \home\fs1

RUN  NETSCAN (now SCAN) scan g: /a
you could run CHECKOUT with SCAN to catch
compressed files this way also.

If all is ok we "rm" the files in the restricted area

This method takes about 15 mins to sreach 1.5 gb, move the new files
to the holding area and scan them... this is done with a batch
file or XTree UNIX. The batch file requires a

Almost certainly not a virus.  "Zombie" is technical jargon for
a process or task that has ended ("died") but isn't quite shut
down yet (and so is "undead").  I would guess that some OS/2
application that you're using is spawning tasks now and then,
and changing the title to "Zombie" between the time the task
finishes and the time it's been all cleaned up.

Our OS/2 programs are true 32-bit applications and as such will only
run on OS/2 2.0 and above only.  They won't run on an OS/2 1.X (16
bit) system, and there are no plans to make OS/2 1.X-compatible
versions either.

We've seen a virus that we call YMP-NiceDay; it may be the same
thing that you have.  It's a diskette and hard disk master boot
infector, and on the first of the month it will display
"HAVE A NICE DAY (c) YMP" during boot.  To clean up an infected
hard disk:

   - Power off and boot from a clean DOS diskette.

   - Make sure the hard disk partitions are visible
     (Important!  Don't skip this step!).

   - Use "FDISK /MBR" to replace the code in the master
     boot record.  (This requires the FDISK command from
     DOS 5 or better.)

We've seen this virus only in Indonesia so far, but that's not
*too* far from you.   Of course, the virus that you have may
be completely unrelated to the one I describe here!

It means that the virus is stealthed, and the master boot
record doesn't contain a valid partition table.  When you
boot from an infected hard disk or diskette, the virus's
stealth code shows everyone (including DOS) the original
MBR, including the PT.  But when you boot clean, the virus
MBR, with no PT, is all you can see.   Solutions:

  - Get an anti-virus program that knows about this virus,
    and can find and restore the original MBR (with PT),

  - Do it yourself, by analyzing the viral MBR, finding where
    it's stashed the original, and putting the original back
    (or have your local guru do it).

The Monkey viruses are the most common viruses in North
America that do this; I don't know of any common ones
in the UK that do.  *Don't* use FDISK /MBR on the hard disk;
it will either do nothing, or it will remove the virus code
from the MBR, leaving only the invalid PT, and then the
hard disk won't be accessible even after booting from an
infected BR...

VSHIELD can not be loaded high with Quarterdeck Office Systems'
LOADHIGH.COM program.  If you are trying to load VSHIELD high by using
LOADHIGH.COM it will fail.  Instead, run VSHIELD by itself with the
/LH switch.  For example, changing the VSHIELD line in your
AUTOEXEC.BAT to read

	C:\MCAFEE\VSHIELD /LH {...other options go here...}

will allow VSHIELD to load the majority of its code into upper memory
(approximately 1.5Kb remains in conventional, 25Kb loads high, and
20Kb goes into EMS, if present) successfully.

One thing to watch out for is the OPTIMIZE program that comes with
QEMM 7.01: One of our agents had a problem with VSHIELD locking up
when run--it turned out he needed to exclude his network interface
card from the upper memory area and OPTIMIZE was not detecting this.

From:    "Roger Riordan" <riordan@tmxmelb.mhs.oz.au>
Subject: MSAV and Stoned 4 (PC)

We have been getting some flak recently from users who have been
told by MSAV that their PC has Stoned 4, but everything else says
it is clear.  Also we are told that some service types have been
making a packet "removing" the infection, or even replacing
perfectly good hard disks (and naturally saying VET, or whatever,
is no good "because it can't detect the virus").  Most of these
reports have come from Tasmania.

We have eventually managed to establish what appears to be
happening.  The PCs have had Stoned (the standard variety),
and someone has used something (some version of FDISK /MBR, or
some other AV software?) which has overwritten the start of the
virus with a good MBR, but left part of it after the boot
program.  This contains the signature used by MSAV, so it reports
Stoned 4.  Naturally nothing else finds the "virus" because there
isn't one.

I reported an almost identical false alarm with VET last year.
No one knew of a version of FDISK which did not zero the offending
area, but no one could offer an alternative explanation of how
the good boot program had been put back without overwriting all
the virus.

We chose another signature to avoid the problem, but of course it
is too much to hope that MSAV would do anything as sensible.

It is a memory resident polymorphic steatlh virus.  It's 4000 bytes long,
and when it activates ( I forget the cause), it rattles your screen
back and forth.  It DOES use high memory (if available).

Yes, that's all it does.  It doesn't intentionally cause any damages, if
that is what you're concerned about.  The Little Black Book is written by
Mark Ludwig, and it contains source code for entire viruses, as well of
descriptions how o write them.

It infects .COM files, in the current directory I beileve.  It has a very
low chance of spreading.  I'm curious how you got it.

Either of those would work, but pay attention to what you're doing, if you
should do this, as you can infect your system if you don't.

Well, "The Little Black Book" will tell you more than all you need to
know about it.  (How, by the way, did you learn that it was from "a
little black book"?)  From the assembly source code comments:

Yes, the virus only infects COM files.  The first five bytes of the
file are repositioned, and replaced with a jump and the letters VI
which are used as an infection marker.  The body of the virus is
appended to the end of the host file.

TIMID doesn't seem to carry any payload, although, of course, with the
source code published in a book there is no telling what variants are
possible.  Timid hasn't been seen very widely "in the wild" in spite
of the book: where does this infection originate?

I recall reading an article in which John McAfee said he feels the common
user doesn't care what virus their computer is infected with, they just
want to know whether or not they have one, and if they do, they want to get
rid of it.  Wouldn't that be sooo nice?

The problems are that SCAN doesn't reliably identify all of the common
polymorphic viruses, so this argument begins to lose it's strength.
Detecting some viruses is worse than not detecting them at all, IMHO...
Simply, because the person gets a false sense of security, after "cleaning"
their system.

Next, There are many closely related viruses, many of which have small
changes to the size of the virus (look, for example, at all the Vienna
viruses, and their respective sizes...!)

If a scanner can't identify the viruses right, how do you expect to clean
them!?  If virus A is detected as, say, some 300 bytes virus, and then, in
fact, the virus is 600 bytes long, when removing it, there are going to
be some problems, eh?  If Clean does do checking to make sure it has the
right virus, then why not put it in scan, and reliably detect viruses,
too?

Scan is also hella-slow.  I think SCAN will slowly become a heuristics
scanner in the future..  Sorta seems where they're headed now.

Are you sure that you are running the same version of mushDOS on the
floppy? Earlier versions of MSDOS can have trouble with the
modifications to the file system introduced with version 5.

Just a guess for what its worth.

Vshield108 seems to be a real memory hog during initialization.  I checked
it out using QEMM's LOADHI /GS (get statistics), but QEMM reported it needing
anywhere from 230K to 580K to start up!!  If memory is a real concern, you
might try either using disk swapping (VSHIELD /SWAP, in conventional memory)
or use frisk's VIRSTOP, which is much smaller (since it is written in
assembly, whereas VSHIELD is mostly C) and can be loaded high easily with
QEMM's LOADHI.

The only infected CD that I am aware of is "SO MUCH SHAREWARE VOLUME II"
XYPHR2.ZIP is infected with the Power Pump virus.

Are you kidding?  WordPerfect is a wonderful program!  Version 5.1 is one of
the last of the fast, truly code-optimized programs.  (Except for most
viruses, that is...)  :-(

Something is clearly corrupting your files.

Make sure you reboot from a clean, write-protected floppy disk with the
same version of DOS before you scan.  This will keep "stealth" viruses from
hiding themselves during scanning.  The programs you have described are
typically quite good at finding viruses, even if they are in memory, but
the cold boot is ALWAYS a good idea.

I doubt if a virus is deliberately corrupting your files, more likely it is
due to a TSR conflict with something in your system, or just a buggy program
somewhere.  Are you running Stacker or another disk compression program?
Are you using Smartdrv or another disk cache with write-caching?  Do you ever
power down your computer while programs are running? (excluding DOS,
of course)  Have you checked out your hardware with Norton Calibrate
and/or CheckIt Pro?

I would also strongly recommend that you install some sort of integrity
checking software.  One shareware program is Integrity Master, available as
"i-m201.zip" from Simtel-20 mirror FTP sites.  Install it to a bootable
floppy disk and write-protect it.  Periodic scanning for changes in your
programs takes some time, but it will help alert you to patterns of file
corruption, whether due to unknown viruses or hardware/software failures.

Gotcha! Didn't test this, did you? MS-DOS parses the internal
commands first, just as you described, but it will execute
the internal commands even if they are entered on the command
line with any extension whatsoever.

So, even if you have DIR.COM in the current directory, command
"DIR.COM" will execute the internal DIR. Same goes for EXE, BAT,
TXT, TMP or anything else (actually it's quite strange that internal
commands entered with a non-executable extension work).

I tested this under MS-DOS 5.00 and 6.00 - the older versions
may act differently. Command interpreter replacement 4DOS acts
just like MS-DOS's COMMAND.COM in this respect.
