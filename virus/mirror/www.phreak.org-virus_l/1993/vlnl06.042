When will you guys figure out that the PC magazine reviews of
antivirus products favored those who spend a lot of money advertising?
These magazines don't want to offend their advertisers, they exist to
help the advertisers sell more product.  Just look at the things they
advocate, and how can you believe anything else?

Subject: Typo in VSHIELD 102 values, Questions about -AV (PC)

It has come to my attention that there is a typo in the VALIDATE values
listed in my posting announcing VSHIELD Version 5.22V102.  The correct
VALIDATE values for the program are as follows:

VSHIELD 5.22V102 (VSHIELD.EXE)      S:45,724   D:02-27-93   M1: 06EB  M2: 066C

My apologies for any confusion.

On a semi-related note, I have received several messages asking why no 
Authenticity Verification codes were displayed when the various McAfee
programs were downloaded from ftp sites and then unzipped.  The reason
is that the programs were zipped with PKZIP Version 1.10, and the only
time they will display the -AV message is when they are unzipped with
PKUNZIP Version 1.10, specifically, the "U.S. only" version of PKUNZIP
which is not available at WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL, but may be available
at other ftp sites outside the U.S.  If you using PKUNZIP Version 2.04
to unzip the programs, you will not see the -AV message.

This is actually a mistake of the author of the program. The number of
really different decryptors is 96, I think... However, there are two
different versions of PS-MPC.

Uh, "less buggy" is probably a better description. I mean, the viruses
created with PS-MPC often work...

Actually, the ZIP archive is encrypted with a password and the
installation program asks for another password, before unarchiving the
file. However, it is relatively trivial to hack both passwords out of
the installation program...

Well, there are some threats. First, since those programs are
available, the anti-virus researchers must work to provide protection
from the viruses created with them. Second, it is possible for someone
to just sit down and create hundreds of viruses with those kits, which
means that the scanners and their developer will have some hard
time... Fortunately, the authors of those virus authoring packages
have not been very good in implementing polymorphism, so it is
relatively easy to make a scanner that detects any virus generated by
those programs. At last, the third danger is that the viruses are
generated in source - so that people could modify them easily, e.g. in
order to make them not detected by the currently existing scanners...

Problem is, because those kits have been made available on many
underground virus exchange BBSes, many of those "hateful" people can
easily obtain a copy of them... :-(

"This question"?  Your Subject line seems to ask about a "Word
Perfect" virus.  There was a postulation, around 1988 and 89, that a
virus had specifically targetted the Word Perfect program.  This was
later found to be false: an artifact of the fact that the WP.EXE file
sometimes stopped working after it had been infected.  This was thus
often the first indication of a virus infection which was not being
detected by other means.

Document files are data, and, while they are sometimes attacked by a
virus, tend not to be the primary targets.  (The existence of "macro"
viral programs has been theorized, and Word Perfect does have a macro
capability, but Word Perfect, unlike other macro capable programs,
does not store macros in the data/document files.)

In order to advize in this matter, we need more information.  Have you
examined the large files?  One possibility is that files are being
repeatedly "called" into the document, thus increasing the size.

This isn't particularly helpful. other than indicating that the
problem you have is not likely viral.

>Any info would be greatly appreciated!

We, also, would appreciate more spcific information.

Sorry, it won't. It will catch any modification, that's true. But if you get 
infected with a slow virus, the user just would regard the change as 
legitimate. Then, Vesselin introduced the idea of a DOS file fragmentation 
attack. You could not detect that with a file-oriented CRC checker, too.

Unloading is a problem if the TSR is not the last one in the TSR chain. 
Disabling would be more "efficient", as the user could not recognize any 
memory freed up.
How do you get your system straight if you remove a TSR out of the middle of 
the chain - is there a method?

Yes, there are ways but not in the way of changing names. However the reason 
that your experiance has failed is that most viruses use DOS functions to find 
their victims, for example chaining to Interrupt 21h and looking for service 
4bh (execute file) is a common way of doing it. So you see: what you did has 
no imlication on that way of infecting since the virus will absorb it's 
information from the DOS function "exec" regardless of the file's name :-))

Keep on trying, you might get there in the end...

Who told you so? It is quite foolish to read a boot sector with INT 25, I don'

How exactly do you do that? If a virus has been loaded and is chained to INT 
13h, so that when you look for Sector-X Cyl-Y Head-Z it will replace it with 
another location and you will never know !

Any way that you might point out as the total solution to the problem, I can 
show a hole that viruses (naturally) may (or alredy do) use.

Not necessarily so, but quite likely. As for myself, I do not recommend using 
these double-diskers, since the problem that you mentioned (and viral problems 
in whole) is only a small portion of possible problems to happened. And 
believe me - you don't want to be the owner of a disk when it crashes.

It remindes me of the EXPANDED memory cards that people used to buy once, and 
got stuck with it immediatelly since EXTENDED memory has emerged. Get a bigger 
(faster) and reliable disk.

Maybe so - but telling somebody that he has a "Generic-X" virus, to take an
extreme example - where "Generic-X" can be one of many, totally different
viruses is of very little help to the user.  I agree that it may not be
important to know exactly which minor subvariant of Jerusalem hits, if
the software can get rid of it, and tell you what the effects are, but
suppose that somebody took the "standard" version of Jerusalem, modified
it so it corrupted data files, and released it - I think most users would
like their scanners to be able to differentiate between this variant and the
standard one...

 Suppose you tell a user: "You have the
>Parkinson.AtzeliCholine.Flue desease" (not that such exists), what do

In that case he has at least a better chance of getting the correct threatment,
than if you tell him: "you have a generic disease".

>the virus exist that you don't even know about? Doeas it cause any problem in 
>cleaning these viruses from an infected site even if their name is simply "

the actual name is not significant, with respect to cleaning
 - what matters is the ability of the anti-virus
software to distinguish between variants that must be removed in different
ways or have different effects - something you cannot do if you call all
the Jerusalem variants just "Jerusalem-B"

It might not be that easy:
I had my thesis blown up from 200 Kb to 500 Kb during one day of work.
After some examination I found out that the overhead had to be invisible
codes WP saves with the document. I could create documents of abt. 300 kb
containing a single space! I got the impression this all was caused by some
ugly editing: moving subtrees a level up in the document hierarchy.

I suggest you ask WP-people about it.

Subject:      * MS-DOS BUG *

**** IMPORTANT FYI ******
  People, There is a potentially dangerous bug in MS-DOS 5.0. The bug will
effectively wipe part of your hard disc, rendering it unusable to any program.
The bug only effects certain disk setups: Those with partitions with more than
65,278 file allocation units. This translates to disks with capacities between
127Mb and 129Mb, 254Mb and 258Mb, 508Mb and 516Mb, 1,018Mb and 1,030Mb, and
2,034 and 2,061Mb. The problem only occurs when you use the
  UNDELETE /ALL
  CHKDSK /F
  The /F and /ALL switches activate the fix options, to alter errors in the
file allocation table, and recover lost units. When CHKDSK or UNDELETE are run
they write 256 copies of the FAT table all over the root directory, making
data recovery almost impossible. ** PLEASE use Norton Disk Doctor to solve FAT
tables. ** CHRIS HOLBURN

Are you sure that it is not a false positive? How many files were
infected? Which scanner did you use? Which version of it?

Eugene Kaspersky probably means the documentation of his anti-virus
product. If he is willing to make that file publicly available, I
could put it for anonymous ftp (he doesn't have ftp access).

The file contains a good technical description of many viruses, with a
slight bias towards the Russian viruses (which is understandable). The
only think I didn't like was the abuse of the term "very dangerous
virus" - even for viruses that are not intentionally destructive, like
Form... :-)

Yes, this is exactly what Michelangelo does. It overwrites the first
255 tracks of the disk with what happens to be at segment 5000h -
usually zeroes. Take a look at some tracks after track 255 - if there
are no zeroes there but some information, it is yet another
confirmation that the Michelangelo virus has caused the destruction.

BTW, I am very curious how many Michelangelo hits have happened this
year...

First, no MtE-based virus is spread in the wild, so maybe you should
not be that much concerned about that particular problem. Second, I am
sorry to disappoint you, but NAV 2.1 is NOT able to detect the
MtE-based viruses reliably. For more information, look at the report
on testing 17 different scanner for detection of MtE-based viruses.
The report is available via anonymous ftp as

ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de:/pub/virus/texts/tests/mtetests.zip

Third, if you are concerned only about the inability of NAV to detect
the MtE-based viruses, there are several freeware programs that -do-
detect those viruses reliably. One of them can be obtained from our
ftp site:

ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de:/pub/virus/progs/catchm18.zip

Thanks Vesselin:
 
I just hope that some coherent naming system can be developed to prevent 
the habit of having four different names for the same virus.

Thanks for the update. I guess I will have to make a 23K bait file then.

I incorrectly assumed that 8Tunes required the largest bait file my 
appologies.
 
some viruses infect only some special files (Lehigh infects only
COMMAND.COM, ZeroHunter infects only files with large areas of zeroes
in them, some viruses do not infect files with some particular names,
etc.

I was aware of Zero Hunt inly infecting files with areas of 00 hex. 
Usually data or buffer areas. This is how that Zero Hunt can infect files, 
but not show a increase in the filesize.
 
I was also aware that Lehigh only infected COMMAND.COM
 
Uh, what do you mean by "file size fluctuates"?

In my tests,  with ARJ 2.30. The new archive filesize would occasionally  
be 2 - 10 bytes larger or smaller than the original archive that I was 
comparing it against.
 
There was no virus present, and in the time I tested this idea with ARJ, I 
wasn't able to find out what was causing the difference. 

LHA, and PKzip archives remain constant day after day after day.

And what if the virus refuses to infect files with such names?

My writing must be a lot worse than I thought it was. ;-(

I never meant to imply that my idea was the perfect solution to detect 
viruses.
 
It is only an idea that will detect viruses that scanners may miss, or an 
early warning system for people that use integrity checking software.
 
Most people believe that Virus detection = Scanners.

Integrity Checking if used properly will detect all changes, but some 
people believe it is too painful to use. ;-)

In general, the idea is equivalent to checking the integrity of a
small subset of your executables.

Exactly! As I said above some people feel that integrity checking software 
is too painful to use. They can set up this .BAT file and painlessly check 
for change to their vital files in only a few seconds.
 
It only takes 4.5 to 5 seconds on my 33 MHZ 486) to check the six files 
that I access constantly. These are most likely to get infected that any 
of the other files on my system.
