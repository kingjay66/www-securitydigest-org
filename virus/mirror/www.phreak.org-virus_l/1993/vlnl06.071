I apologize for being indistinct. I had in mind virus infecting
anti-virus program is very suspicious activity.

I've read them. I wish to see clear definition of "attach". I add here
suggestion for competitors : When your definition contains term
"attaching to something(whatever)", please define what you exactly mean
with it.

I wish to understand the meaning of "beneficial viruses". Please, could
you send your suggestion to category 4. Ethical definition? I apologize to
Dr. Cohen if anything I wrote looked as "jumping on him" (without nasty
thoughts, please).

I wouldn't agree that doing damage is "optional side effect". So, I leave
to competitors to decide whether or not will include this property in
their definitions.

Causing directly or indirectly unauthorized modifications to computer
information is IMHO too large frame. Existing laws defined that way are
not sufficient for effective action against virus writers. I agree that
definition may be extended to trojan horses and logic bombes, but not to
spoofs and hacking. Those are different things. The point is to find
definition which could be possibly used as basis for adequate law (which
doesn't exist now). So, I suggest to competitors to stress what is the
part in -written- code (virus, trojan horse, logic bomb, etc.) which
could be considered as punishable.

O.K. I consider you as member of jury for these two categories and all
respective contributions will be sent to you. However, till all members
of jury (juries) for all categories are not known, competitors are asked
to send contributions only to my address celustka@sun.felk.cvut.cs or
address bellow.

I've been asked to add form "haiku" for category 6. Poethical definition.
I didn't limit forms, only said limerick is preferable form, but all
others are welcome too (thanks to Mr. Zmudzinsky for interesting haiku).

There is also another method that will often work - even if the virus
has encrypted the entire original file. In general, the method
consists of interpreting the virus until it transfers control to the
original program - at which time it should have decrypted it, of
course. The program TbClean from the package TBAV uses this method.
Note that I am not saying that the method is fool-proof - it is just
yet another useful tool against viruses.

I'd hate to start a political flame war, but nevertheless, here it
goes.

Please, note that "this country" is not the only one in the Universe.
There are others, which may and often do have different laws.
According to those laws, something that might be obviously allowed in
your country, may be seriously illegal in those other countries. A
very good example is the possession of guns - it is a right of every
US citizen, granted by the US Constitution, but is illegal in most
other countries. (Please, no flames here whether this is "good" or
"bad".)

Unfortunately, viruses and electronic publications like 40-Hex do not
recognize national boundaries. While this electronic newsletter might
be perfectly legal in the USA (or not - I just don't know), it also
might be illegal in many other countries. For instance, I think that
according to the British law, it contains incitements to commit crime
and is thus illegal. (I might be wrong, I am by no means expert in
legal matters.)

The point is that just because something is allowed in your country,
you shouldn't assume that it is also allowed everywhere else and that
it is OK to do it everywhere else. In fact, if you are a responsible
person, you must actually check whether it is permitted in all places
where you intend to promote it. Never forget - the net is
international.

As to the Anarchist Cookbook you mentioned in your message - I've read
parts of it and have to tell you that many of the materials described
there are not freely allowed in Bulgaria, for instance. Not that they
are forbidden - it is just almost impossible for the average private
citizen to find them.

Indeed, those two books are very good. BTW, the second one is
partially mentioned in the FAQ - which is yet another opportunity to
emphasize why people should read the FAQ... :-)

I like significantly less the electronic implementation of Dr.
Solomon's virus enciclopaedia - it contains too few and too general
information about the viruses it describes.

Strange, according to the download statistics that I have access to
(those of garbo.uwasa.fi and of our ftp site), SCAN is downloaded
approximately three times more than F-Prot. I can see the following
explanations for this:

1) 32 is not a representative number to draw conclusions like yours.
The ftp sites I mentioned deal with hundreds of downloads per month of
only those two programs.

2) You have mainly asked the participants of this forum. I often post
here about superiority of F-Prot, so the folks here are likely to be
informed. It might not be so with the rest of the world... :-)

All the above proves only that it is difficult to define how much
information about viruses is dangerous and how much isn't. Indeed, it
is extremely difficult to make such a decision - and everybody must
make it for him/herself. There is no formal rule that can help.
Everyone has to take the responsibility to decide how much of his/her
knowledge about such ambiguous matters will be more useful than harmful
to the general public.

But useful to *whom*?  *Which* others are you trying to teach: the virus
writers or the AV people?  The very fact that you completely ignore
this little distinction says a lot about you.

  Some people expose tricks used by *virus writers* and explain to the
*AV people* how to deal with them.  Your article does the opposite: It
describes tricks, along with sample code, to prevent or bypass tech-
niques used by the *AV people*, something which would be most useful
to the *virus writers*, as is evidenced by the fact that one of them
chose to forward it to 40 Hex.  That's not what you had in mind?

A very good, and very important, question.  Certainly spread via
all of (A) through (E) happen.  You can add to the list any other
method you can think of whereby program code that's on one machine
at one time can be executed on another machine at another time.
As you point out, it'd be good to figure out the relative
important of each method for virus spread, so as to know where
to concentrate limited resources.

In our experience, and it's unfortunately mostly anecdotal
rather than systematic, local virus spread happens mostly
via diskette exchange (SneakerNet).  LAN-mediated spread
happens less often, but can have a much larger and more
sudden effect.  Wider spread (between, rather than among,
groups of people who work together) is harder to observe
and track.  That is, it's easy to guess that in a given
incident machine B got infected when a diskette from machine
A was accidentally used to boot it, when A and B are in
the same room.  But how the virus got to Company X in
the first place is generally very hard to determine.
Sometimes an employee finds out that his home machine
is infected, and that the same virus is rampant at
his daughter's university.  Sometimes a machine has been
serviced by someone who discovers that he has an
ongoing infection.  Or whatever.  But most of the time
we just don't find out; the infection is cleaned up, but
the original source remains mysterious.

There are various interesting questions that can be
asked and studied by applying epidemiological methods
to computer-virus spread.  Jeff Kephart here has been
doing some very interesting work on what various
spread-models imply for virus growth and anti-virus
measures.  But we still don't have a good feel for
what a reasonable model of the real world should look
like; which of the theoretical models the real world
most resembles.  That's hard data to gather, especially
when informal networks like SneakerNet play such a
large role.  When a virus/worm spreads mostly or only
via a particular hardware network (as the Internet
worm spread via Internet), the easy and hard things
are somewhat different...

I wish to distribute them via anonymous ftp. May I do so? I think
that in this way we'll be providing a valuable service to your users.
At least to those of them who do have Internet access but don't call
BBSes.

If you don't support ftp access, would you allow to others to do it
for you? We also have a BBS at the VTC-Hamburg, but I am not
maintaining it, so I cannot decide what is there and what not. But I
do maintain our ftp site, so I can put there the latest NAV definition
updates, if Symantec allows us to do so.

Yeah, but we are talking about Michelangelo. It asks about the system
date at boot time, when no operating system is loaded, and when the
user has not had the opportunity to enter the system date - yet.
That's why I expressed by doubt that Mich will activate on such a
system - it activates its payload only at boot time.

I thought that we made it clear publicly... OK, never mind, here it
goes.

No, it is not possible for a virus to survive warm reboot unnoticeably
on all kinds of IBM PC compatible machines. It is, however, possible
for it to survive warm reboot on SOME classes of such machines. For
instance:

1) 100% compatible XT machines - using one method.

2) True IBM machines or any other machines, the BIOS of which does not
display any messages during the warm reboot. This can be achieved by a
different method. There are already at least two viruses using it -
Joshi and Alabama.

3) '386 or above based machines, using a third method.

It is also possible for a virus to fake a reboot from a floppy - like
EXE_Bug does - thus making it look like if it has survived the reboot
(even a "cold" one).

Read the FAQ, questions C4 and A7. This particular virus is described
in the Computer Virus Catalog, published by our VTC. Question A7 tells

Boot from a write-protected uninfected system diskette, containing DOS
5.0, and enter FDISK/MBR. This will remove the virus from the hard
disk.

BTW, F-Prot should be able to disinfect it - wasn't it? You could also
try CLEAN - it can remove the virus and calls it Cansu.

Side question - could somebody with MS-DOS 6.0 verify whether the
FDISK/MBR trick still works and post the results? Thanks.

Contradiction - the 1621 and 1706 variants have other infective
lengths. Not to mention that there's also a variant with infective
length of 1661 bytes.

What does ".COM Infector" mean exactly? Cascade can infect a file with
.EXE extension, if it is of COM-type. For instance - if the Vacsina
virus has converted it into such file. Thus, if you look for Cascade
only in the files with a .COM extension, you might miss some infected
files. That's not just theory - I've seen it happen in exactly the
same combination - Vacsina+Cascade and a scanner that thought it would
be very smart to look for Cascade only in the *.COM files...

Huh, the set of removal tool is pretty slim, compared with the number

most of the can also disinfect it.

Wrong, both the 1701- and the 1704-byte variants infect true IBM PCs
too. It's a bug in the virus - the author -intended- not to infect
such computers, then tried to fix the bug, but unsuccessfully.

Music? Cascade? Hmm... has anybody heard about this one? Have to check
our samples...

Anyway, the different variants of Cascade are listed in such a way,
that it is not possible to identify them - we have even more variants
here (about two dozen), but there's no way one can figure which are
exactly the ones listed in VSUM...

Now, the above simply means "I don't know"; it is just expressed in a
very sophisticated way. When you don't know something about a virus,
you just get a debugger and see what the virus does. You understand
it, you draw conclusions and make conjectures, then test them on a
sacrificial system. Then you write a careful report. This is how an
anti-virus researcher operates. You don't tell the world "look, guys,
I couldn't replicate the sample that was sent to me, and I have no
idea what it does" and especially you don't call this "information
about the virus"!

How does the original infect you, if you are told that it couldn't be

Ah, the story about the activation date is a very funny one; even our
CVC entry contains an error about that. The virus does the following
to get and check the date:

        MOV     AH,4            ;get realtime clock date
        INT     1Ah
        CMP     DL,18h          ;day of the month

However, this function returns the information in DX register in BCD
format! That is, '18h' in this case means 18th of every month, not
18h = 24. The appropriate byte string for INT 1Ah; CMP DL,?? is
CD1A80FA?? and can be found at offset 0B0h of the infected boot
sector. The byte marked with '??' is therefore at offset 0B4h. We have
4 different variants of Form here, and in three of them this byte
contains 18h. In one of them the contents is 05h, which means that
this variant activates on the 5th of every month. All the other ones
activate on 18th of every month - NONE activates on 24th, as is
mentioned in several sources, including ours...

This is exactly what the original virus does.  (BTW, did you notice
that you are not told how the "original" virus replicates and where
does it store the boot sector?) FORM-Canada is just the original,
working virus.  Actually, I'm afraid that many of the listed in VSUM
virus variants exist only in Mrs.  Hoffman's imagination.

Too many mistakes/incorrectnesses/incompletenesses for two "good"

Strange that you have been unable to notice them yourself - some of

The reason Vesselin stated that Mich would not trigger on CMOS-less XTs is
because the system date has not been set when Mich makes the check.  Mich 
infects the MBR - ie, it is "run" before the autoexec is.

Also, the DOS "date" and "time" commands set the DOS "date" and "time".  
The "DOS" date and time are not always equal to the "System" date and time.
In fact, some "times" you need a setup disk to change the "system" date and
time.

I remember to have destroyed a EGA Color monitor by installing MS-DOS
version 4.0 on a Sperry HT (a XT from 1986). (I was able to repeat it
with another machine of the same type, but managed to switch it off
quick enough...)

Probably some switch inside this monitor was driven crazy by very
rapid video mode changes caused by a BIOS incompatibility problem.

So software can be really hardware destructive (IHMO).

It's possible for file infectors to propagate through NetWare servers,
and then infect workstations. A boot sector infector cannot infect a
server from a workstation.

The risk from file infectors is why I scan seven NetWare servers *every*

Yes, this will protect the files real well. Including protecting them from
being backed up. There are other problems as well, which is why execute-only
is a bad idea in most situations.

However, the virus must first infect a conventional .COM or .EXE file in
order to get onto the server in the first place. The size of such a virus
would seem to be quite large, making it very noticable when it infects
the .COM or .EXE. Of course, it'd need to have the Novell Developers' Kit
libraries linked in (otherwise it'd be difficult for it to infect a NLM),
as well as the payload. Pretty soon, this gets so complex and unwieldy it's
not likely to work.

>I believe that the new trend of viruses will be for netware (this is my 
>opinion!) as NLM infectors!

I don't. Propagation would be a problem, size, bugs, etc. With the 
changes in NetWare from time-to-time, they'd be very version-specific,
and would just have to do too much to work. I worry about file infectors,
keep the servers themselves secure so BSIs aren't a problem, and leave
it at that.

Remember: A majority of the American people voted against *all* of the
Presidential Candidates. How encouraging....

Don't think your way. For further info I would liketo direct you
to the comp.os.linux group. I don't read it (I donot have as much time :),
but I receive the mailing list for linux. And there (from time to time) there
are "help wanted???" reports of blowing the monitor by playing around with
Xconfig. (This file contains also some register values.) For VGA-monitors I
do not know for sure because I overrun my monitor from time to time, but I
killed some time ago my EGA-monitor (and it was not monochrome). So damaging
monitors sounds possible to me. (You know the sounds my monitor gives when I am
taking it beyond it's possibilities doesnot sound nice. I can think, having
a worse monitor (I mean in quality,...) the same actions could kill the
monitor.

Subject: Disinfectant 3.2 Announcement (Mac)

Disinfectant 3.2

April 21, 1993

Disinfectant 3.2 is a new release of our free Macintosh anti-viral 
utility.

Version 3.2 detects the new INIT-M virus.

The INIT-M virus was discovered at Dartmouth College in April, 1993. 

INIT-M is a malicious virus. It is designed to trigger on any Friday the 
13th. The virus severely damages a large number of folders and files. 
File names are changed to random 8 character strings. Folder names 
are changed to random 1-8 character strings. File creators and types 
are changed to random 4 character strings. This changes the icons 
associated with the files and destroys the relationship between 
programs and their documents. File creation and modification dates 
are changed to Jan. 1, 1904. In some cases, one file or folder on a disk 
may be renamed "Virus MindCrime". In some very rare circumstances, 
the virus may also delete a file or files.

Note that the next three Friday the 13ths are in August 1993, 
May 1994, and January 1995.

The virus can also sometimes cause problems with the proper 
display of windows.

The virus only spreads and attacks under System 7.0 or later. It does 
not spread or attack under System 6. The Disinfectant protection INIT, 
however, will detect an infected application under any system.

The virus infects all kinds of files, including extensions, applications, 
preference files, and document files.

The virus creates a file named "FSV Prefs" in the Preferences folder. 
If you use Disinfectant to repair an infected system, it will delete 
this file.

The damage caused by the INIT-M virus is very similar to that caused 
by the INIT 1984 virus. Despite this similarity, the two viruses are 
very different in other respects, and should not be confused.

Version 3.2 also contains two other changes:

There was an error in version 3.1 in the changes made to the damaged 
file detection code. This error affected only a very few people with very 
rare kinds of damaged files. Version 3.2 fixes the problem. Thanks to
Stephen Lardieri of Princeton University for helping to find and fix this
error.

Disinfectant's preferred memory partition has been increased from 
700K to 1000K. This fixes a problem scanning some specific applications 
with very large CODE resources, including PSpice and Intellidraw. Thanks
to the many users who reported this problem.

Disinfectant 3.2 is available now via anonymous FTP from site 
ftp.acns.nwu.edu [129.105.113.52], file 
pub/disinfectant/disinfectant32.sea.hqx. It will also be available 
soon from most of the other popular sources of free and shareware 
software.
