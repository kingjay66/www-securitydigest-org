I'm not sure, but the virus could be too complicated or too new for
theese scanners to detect. My advice for you, is to download (from a
friend who is NOT infected with the virus) mcafee scan (newest
verision) and mcafee clean from mcafee.com (or was it mcaffee.com) and
put it on a boot disk and write protect the disk. Then boot from the
disk and use scan on your compy (note: I think this won't worked on
stacked drives). If you still cant find anything, try getting f-prot
from complex.is and do with that as you did with the others.  (It can
scan for generic viruses too, and thats a +). Hope this will help.

Note2: You should scan your harddrive first and disinfect it, then get vshield
       from mcafee.com, install it, and then copy the virus scanner that
       detected the virus to your harddrive (don't forget the disinfector)
       NOW you are ready to disinfect your disks.

I hope this wasn't too complicated. Keep us posted via News! =)

Boy, this sound bad. I think your'e at the point of no return now.
Hmm.... An idea would have been to try Pctools "diskfix" (i suspect
it's a bit better than norton). And.....um.....perhaps bring the drive
to a hardware dealer to check it out (perhaps some part has screwed),
well, diskfix will ofcource not work with your harddisk if it's
non-recogniziable, and what your harddisk has done is (i think) a bit
out of the normal behaviour. Well, it could have been a virus, yes, i
think so. In the state that your HD is now, i have no real help to
give. Hope things clear soon. Good luck!

SO, after *ALL* these affirmatives, the Q U E S T I O N  is :

Where (ie a sitename please) can the NAV definition file updates be

I've heard that there are BBS's which have them, but this is of NO

Any advice would be welcome.

	Recently I loaded Central Point Anti-Virus on my system and it
found the "Stoned Virus" in my memory.  Well, I've been having serious
problems with Windows like it's causing an error stating, "General
Protection Fault in module KRNL386.exe at 0002:14a9."  This error
happens randomnly.  I can't remember when the last time I had
Anti-Virus on there, but I'm afraid that this virus may have caused
some serious damage internally, BUT I don't know, so I'm asking
anybody to give me some kind of answer.  If you know anything about
this virus and what it does please explain it to me because I am
really sick of this problem I'm having and just would like to get it
all over with.

Subject: Hokay, boot sector viruses (PC)

Ok, dudes and dudettes (sp?),

I can't tell if my computer is infected or not, apparently a boot
sector virus called "Boot 437" is being spread around the campus PC's
(methinks, not too sure, McAfee's Scan V106 can't pick it up, but
F-Prot can, unfortunately, fprot cannot eradicate this menace.) Now,
as yet I don't know if my home pc is infected yet.

The thing is, I have been downloading many files from my account to
floppies, and need to know if by chance my floppy is infected with
this boot sector virus, and I just read the files from floppy (copying
them across, etc) will this (as yet) un-scannable (and un-cleanable)
virus infect my pc?

Any help would be appreciated. Flames will gratiously be ignored.

Thanks in advance,
Nigel

Subject: Suspicious .COM files (PC)

I recently downloaded a file, SPORTS.ZIP from the CIX online system
in the UK. It's a program for determining the addresses of your serial
ports, I think.

I scanned it with the new Central Point Anti-Virus version 2.0, which
contains a "virus analyzer" which looks for suspicious virus-like activity
in executable files. It reported a possible file virus in both the files
in the ZIP archive, DOCUMENT.COM and SPORTS.COM. I looked at both files
using a binary editor and discovered that they both have the string

   Hurray the crusades

near the end of the file. Does this ring any bells with anyone? I've also
scanned with SCAN 106 and F-PROT 1.08 but neither detected anything.

Regards,

Mike

Although this might be a way to DETECT that something is wrong it will
still won't prevent viruses from doing it.  Besides, just like you say
when you change something in the IDE sector you have a way to assure
the IDE rom will accept this, maybe in our case a virus can do the
same (?).

But worse: The fact is that these FR-BIOSs alredy exists and are
simply a FR alone. So it may be a good idea to implement such an
algorithm, but it is not still in use. |-(

Great idea !!! I like it.  I would suggest that you (or better who
ever is responsible for VIRUS_L) will keep it for a final conclusion
and suggestions that someone might send a hard- copy to some of the
interested companies.

Any idea what do we do with the present state UNTIL such a method is
implemented?

Amir, this is a different issue here. This is a matter of responsibility, just
like it is the responsibility of software marketers to make sure the programs
they market are virus-free.

As in both cases, if your product is infected, and you find that out, you call
the manufacturer/marketer, and get a clean copy. This shouldn't even get to
that, but this is what you'll have to do.

Well, at the beginning, I thought it should be within the bios. However, after
I read the first two lines of your next paragraph, I thought of two more
solutions:

2. The CRC check will be on a factory-protected (notch-less) floppy;

3. The CRC is on a ROM segment of the ram, even if a few byte only (assuming
   such a thing is possible).

Well, so far, solution two still applies. If a floppy disk is non-writeable,
and assuming that passing this protection is indeed impossible, then it SHOULD
be possible to examine, and completely restore infected BIOSs.

After reading the correspondance between you and Nemrod, I find it is possible
to defend against Flash Bios attacks, since, like I originally claimed, it is
much like fighting with normal software viruses. You just have to get the
first brake.

Regarding an infection of Dir-II:

Your test machine seems to use a DOS version prior to 5.00.  Last week
I tried to infect an hardware protected PC running 5.0, and it just
freezed the machine. I retried with an unprotected laptop running 5.0
ditt o, freezed too. When tracing using Quaid's Analyzer (anyone else
using this uni que tool ??), I saw the reason. Dir-II takes an
assumption where the entry in the Dos-segment should be, cause it
calculates its offset for int 21h calls itself. And under 5.0 (maybe
6.0 , too) it fails.

You don't actually need, and almost certainly don't want, to use a
virus to do this.  Just add a program to users' logmn scripts, or to
some BAT file or other executable that you provide, that does the
tasks that you need done.  This is very common in the LAN world; when
you log onto the LAN, some programs that the LAN admin wants run on
your machine get run.  (It's often used for virus-checking, for
instance!)  The details depend on just what LAN software you're using,
and how it's set up.  But you don't want to use a virus; there's no
reason to alter the programs on the users' machines.  If you can get
the users to run a program that you provide (and you'd have to, in
order to get your "virus" to spread), you might as well just do the
admin acts right there, and save yourself the infinite hassle, bad
publicity, and boss-grilling involved with actually writing a virus...

That just means that you have a few diskettes that were formatted
with a German diskette-formatter.   The "Non-system disk or disk
error" message comes from the diskette itself; diskettes formatted
with non-English formatting programs have non-English versions of
that message on the diskette.   What you're seeing is the usual
"Non-system..." message, in German.  This doesn't mean that there's
definitely *not* a virus there, of course, but by itself it's no
reason to worry.

Kristian Milec asked about making viruses to check users pc's

Why don't you use another way that does not involve viruses?  For
example, use a file finder to search for certain files, like wp.exe,
word.com, things like that, that start the possible "illegal"
programs.  It seems to me that using viruses of any kind may
lead to too many problems.

You should not need to worry, the text is in German and (approximately)
translates to, "No System on Diskette   Change and press a key".  The disk
was probably formatted with a German edition of MS-, PC- or DR- DOS.

We discussed this quite a bit a couple of years ago (Anthony ?) and came to
the conclusion that excepting for Fred Cohen's definition, this does not
require a virus (since I did not win Fred's $1000, I guess he didn't think
so either).

What you are looking at is a two part solution:

a) A login script (why you can do this with Novell Netware and not with
   Lantastic - yet).
b) A "seek and report" program

Of course there could be resident components but in simplest terms it works
like this: As part of the login scripting process the "seek & report" program
is launched and persorms the checkout of the client system. On termination
an ERRORLEVEL is left (and sometimes an information file) that can be used
to determine software/revision/load condition. The script can then use this
information to decide whether to update the client or to refuse to allow
the login. Reports may also be sent to the administrator.

I first used that technique in combatting a virus on a large Novell network
c.a. 1990 that could not be brought down for de-toxing. Also passed some
thoughts on to McAfee & Co. resulting in the Vshield/Chkshld combo.

Point is that non of the components require a "virus" since none propagate
themselves. At most, a new version of a software package is downloaded but
this has nothing to do with viruses.

Ah yes, dear old Flint (believe it or not I am also a GMI grad (ME) with

Subject: Flash EEPROM BIOS (PC)

I started a discussion about the perils of a software-upgradable BIOS
back in 1991 (VIRUS-L Vol.4 #087 or thereabouts).  After my overreaction
and input from various VIRUS-L contributors (particularly Michael Maxim),
I stopped writing about it, satisfied that there would be enough security
to prevent a virus from entering the Flash EEPROM BIOS.

A few weeks ago, I got to mess around with one of the Zenith 486 machines
that is offered to the Air Force on the Desktop IV contract.  Among other
nifty features, it has a software-upgradable BIOS.  However, it is NOT
upgradable from the DOS prompt.  The machine has to be booted to the ROM
Monitor (a different sequence from Ctrl-Alt-Del), and a menu selection
from the Monitor will upgrade the BIOS from a special diskette.  The
information on the diskette is verified by a secure part of the BIOS
which is NOT upgradable (see description of the Flash EEPROM below).

This may be the method used by other machines, but there may be others,
too.  One contributor during the original discussion mentioned that one
of the first manufacturers to offer the software-upgradable BIOS required
that some hardware action like setting a switch be done to prevent any
unscheduled change to the BIOS.  This is also good.  As long as it is a
user-initiated change that cannot be performed solely by a program
running under DOS (or OS/2, UNIX, Novell, etc.), the BIOS should stay
secure from malicious or other unauthorized changes.

Here is Michael Maxim's post regarding the Flash EEPROM chip, and non-
volatile memories in general:

BTW, I exchanged some E-mail with Mr. Maxim last year, and unless things
changed between then and now, he was shifted from production of NVMs to
production of what he called P5 then, and is now known as the Pentium.

As Arte Johnson once said, "Verry Interesting!"  I posted a message to the
same effect earlier this year (VIRUS-L Vol.6 #075).  I got two replies to it,
which corroborated my interpretation of the event:

"My explanation" was that the disk had been formatted with a German version
of DOS, as the message translates roughly to "No System or DOS error.
Replace and press a key."  (Sorry, my German is rusty -- care to give it a
try, Vesselin? ;-) )  What makes it interesting is how several people in
the U.S. can get a German boot sector on their floppy without having a
German version of DOS.  From sheer speculation, I would say it was via a
DISKCOPY of a diskette with a German boot sector, which was a DISKCOPY of a
diskette with a German boot sector, ad nauseum.  Does this explanation meet
with everyone's approval?  Or is there a benign boot virus which carries
the German message?  Or is there a German boot sector dropper?  ;-)

Greetings!

At my place of employment, we have a huge compatibility lab for testing
hardware. The motherboards I have seen with FLASH ROM or EEPROM Bios chips
have a header and a shunt. The shunt is removed to change the contents of the
chip. If this is not true of all motherboards then some certainly may be
suceptible to damaging programs someone may write be they virus, logic bomb
or poorly written user applications. The nu8mber of times I have seen
software that we have purchased go out to lunch and do unexpected things
would lead me to never buy a motherboard without hardware protection for a
re-writeable BIOS. This goes for personal and corporate purchases.

Good Luck!

Does anyone here know German?  That looks vaguely like a German

Mr. Petersen is trying to find a new home for the master archives.  Note
that many of the older files are on CD-ROM, so it is not absolutely
necessary that a site dedicate two GB of disk space, as perhaps 3/4 of
this is on CDs, so the option would be to loan perhaps 4 CD slots in
an optical jukebox, along with perhaps 500 meg of disk space.
