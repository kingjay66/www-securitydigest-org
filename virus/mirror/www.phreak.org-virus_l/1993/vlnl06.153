The point here is not to judge who writes viruses or not, the point
here is responsibility.
Who is to say if you are responsible or not?
The law.
Being responsible applies to everyday life's behaviour, for example you have
to be responsible when you drive your car, responsible to other drivers and
pedestrians, if you are not (driving under the influence of alcohol is an
example,) then you go to jail if caught, simple as that.
If responsabilities in certain social behaviours are not enforced as you seem
to imply then we will be in a lot a trouble!

K>Indeed, it is malicious to allow a virus to spread to unsuspecting
K>users,

yes, indeed!

This argument is ridiculous!
Using the same logic you used before, it can be proven that your train
of thought is contradictory: Who are you to decide whether something is
unethical or not?
Who is the one to decide whether something is unethical or not?
Writing a virus has nothing to do with ethics, as I said before
it is yet to be proven than a virus has no benefits, then writing a virus
is in no way unethical.
Notice that I am refering just to the act of creating a virus.

K>Why would you want to write one?

There are a million possible reasons; just because you cannot see the sun
it does not mean it does not exist.

K>What benefit's can you receive from keeping a virus isolated and never
K>let anyone see it?

What benefit could a scientist receive from studying Anthrax viruses?
if he obviously cannot release it?
The mistake here again is that viruses are not inherently destructive
they may have (at least in theory) a useful purpose.
You have problems undertanding the basic premise that we, are not like others,
i.e. everyone is different, including virus writers, and they all don't have
a need to let people 'see' their work. Some people are beyond the adolescent
stage of 'showing off.' (Some people are not :) )

K>To study it?  If you wrote it, you sure as hell know what it will be
K>doing.

What about to study how it spreads in a particular with a particular
operating system and particular software, to run an epidiological
statistical study?
This is one of may possible cases.

and free writing.

It always has and it always will, regardless of laws and enforcement.
It is part of human nature.
So are computer viruses.

K>Virus writing would be a very difficult thing to enforce.

No, virus writing is impossible to enforce, short of being in a totalitarian
state where public speech and writing is banned, because it is not in the
state's best interests.
It cannot be proven that writing viruses does not serve an educational
purpose.

The whole point is, viruses are more than destructive code, and are more
than the 2 dimensional pieces of code some people would like them to appear.

Subject: Fictional virus and antivirus in Dr. Dobb's Journal , December 1993

While reading the most recent issue of Dr. Dobbs I found an interesting
short-story in Michael Swaine's column; Swaine's Flames. The story is
set in the year 1995. It concerns the InterNet and describes some kind
of new law that demands that everyone connected to the InterNet have a
Guardian on their machines.

The Guardian is the interesting part of the story;

"Guardians are, in layman's terms, antivirus viruses, capable of
seeking out and destroying invading computer viruses."

It is the classic science fiction idea that the most effective means
of defense against a worm or a computer virus must be an anti-worm or
anti-virus. A little like the tape worm in "The Shockwave rider". As
always in SF we are here talking about a network environment, and not
about infection trough floppy disk exchange. Maybe a virus or a worm
made by the "good guys" would be the most effective protection against
a particularly successful "virus" or worm of the future?

If we get UNIX systems that are as compatible with each other as the
different DOS versions are today, we might see some fairly widespread
worms or viruses on such platforms as well. Windows for workgroups 3.11
shows some nice advances in TCP/IP support and integration towards
Windows NT Advanced Server. This, combined with the forthcoming Chicago
(DOS 7/Win 4), may help getting far more people to buy a network card
or a modem. And with the hardware and software in place, we are only
waiting for InterNet to reach the average computer user.

So, maybe the benign virus can exist after all?

    Just a thought,

Subject: Re: anti-virus legislation

I just read in the news about how Sweden will be making virus writing
illegal.

Unfortunately, the definition of a virus that they list in the bill is
very poorly written.  By definition, it covers Stacker (or any other disk
compression utility), and worst of all, it covers most anti-virus
packages, because they (without authorization) will halt your machine if
certain actions are detected.  An example is:  Thunderbytes TBFILE will
reboot your machine if a program attempts to tunnel for an original
interrupt entry point.  Because it doesn't allow you to save your work,
some data could be destroyed, ie: not saved to the disk.

Even halting the machine temporarily, while timing critical functions are
being exercised would be considered an unauthorized altering of data,
since the results of the timings would be thrown off.

Sweden's legal definition of a virus would be impossible to uphold in
court, unless it is drastically changed.

(we won't get into viable definitions, as I am sure the FAQ covers this
well enough).

BTW:  Sweden is attempting to lump trojans into their definition of a
virus.  Doing this will only make the definition more vague than it
already is.

  I'm doing a paper dealing with computer viruses and the crime
associated with it.  I was wondering if anyone knows of a ftp

legislation that has been passed to deal with viruses, or information
about people who have been caught infecting computers.

IMHO this has nothing to do with it, rather it is the *attitude* to which
people treat viruses/firearms that is a major part of the problem:

Kids see firearms portrayed in the media as bright, noisy devices that have
no lasting effect. Until they actually use one (and then it is often too
late) they do not experience the real effects (why military service
has firing ranges - not so much to teach accuracy but to teach what the
effects of firing a weapon are.).

In another lifetime, I recall a bar in which automatic weapons had to be
checked at the door (sidearms were OK, besides, no one would have checked
them). People there tended to be polite. At the time I had a Navy flare gun
with a 10 guage shotgun shell loading #2 buck. Use just about guarenteed
loss of a finger or two, it was for times when the alternative was worse.

Kids watching TV never see anyone deafened by firing a weapon in a closed
area or choking on the fumes. They never *smell* death. Kickboxers all
have perfect teeth & usable noses.

Part of Driver's Ed. used to be a film called "Signal 30". It was not a
pretty film but it was real though it did not have much of the impact
that multi-media could provide today - guess the powers that be feel that
kids are too delicate for that type of thing.

(When the movie "Beetlejuice" came out my thought was that they made it a
comedy because if it were done straight like John Carpenter's "The Thing"
it would have been too intense for the viewing public.)

Problem is that we have allowed people to develop a false sense of
consequences and are reaping the effects. Viruses are just one manifestation
and IMHO a rather trivial one though to an affected individual it seems
bad enough - I just hope that is the worst thing they ever face. However
it is part of the same sick culture that sees life as a cartoon. It will
work for only so long as reality can be kept at bay.

Long time ago I read a short story about a future driver's license test.
The applicant was wired into a "VR" system and made to experience a bad
crash that was their fault. Anyone who still wanted to drive a car failed.

Subject: BEB* virus (PC) ???

A friend just found a virus on a download of Blue Wave Offline Mail Reader.

This virus infected his DOS directory, inserting 2 files to DOS. the files
he found were " BEB_____ " (8 letters, no extensions) The final 5 letters
changed each time the directory was accessed using the more command. ( A
simple DIR command always failed to show the files at all. But when more
was used, e.g. DIR | more, the files showed up as noted) The files did not
seem to do anything to the system, but one has to wonder what would have
happened when or if the two filenames finally matched.

The virus has remained on the HD through a low-level format and on a 3.25
floppy through a Norton Utilities WIPE command. On the HD format, two files
were created with a .FIL extension, attributed RO, hidden, and archive.
Norton screen message said "Saving unformatted data." Any attempt to delete
or otherwise manipulate those files resulted in the usual "access denied."
They weer finally removed by Norton Utilities Disk Editor. He used that to
find, re-attribute, rename, and delete those .FIL files.

Does anyone know anything about this virus?

I looked at 2 or 3 sites and 1.1 was all that was available.  Shortly after
sending the post, I saw a post from the author about 3.0 and ftp'd it directly
from him.  I did notice yours after the fact.  BTW, the sites that I looked at

Sure, now you tell me ;-}  And I'm the person that usually gets consulted on
these things, so I guess I'm out of luck.  But I got several good responses
directly of things I can try.  I'm going to be sending lots of appreciation

Is this common enough to be added to the FAQ?  Or is it there and I just missed
it?  I try to pay attention.

After posting, I called the support number and talked to one of the people
working on this specific problem.  He said that it was a bug in the VIRSTOP
code that failed to recognize it on anything other than a 360K diskette.

That would help, but we already have complaints about response time.  How much
slowdown are we talking here?  Noticeable?

We have a little in-house utility written in Pascal that asks the students what
diskette drive they're going to use.  It's built into our standard batch files
so that we can do a change to the appropriate drive and directory before
calling an application.  Then we check that drive to be sure that there's
actually a disk there.  It saves a lot of garbage being written to the wrong
place and a lot of heartbreak from students who "lost" their documents.

This is all protected in a Novell subdirectory, so they can't bypass it unless
they really know what they're doing, and have a lot of diskette based Novell
utilities in their possession.

I got it and it works!!!  But it's re-active.  I was hoping to stay pro-active
with an intercept.

This, I will probably implement where I can.  The problem with this is that,
1) it needed to be done before the fact and
2) we can only control this in the student computer centers.  We're still not
going to get campus wide protection.

Actually, 2.10 (which is now out) does detect and identify this properly now,
but Frisk said that VIRSTOP still doesn't intercept correctly.  They patched it
and e-mailed me a copy of VIRSTOP 2.10a and it works perfectly.  Thank you, a
million times.

Subject: MS-DOS 6.2 upgrade (PC)

Have been able to download the "free" MS-DOS 6.2 upgrade from the Microsoft
bulletin board (1.3 Mb) and there are a few caveats:

I puchased and use MS-DOS 6.0/6.2 and feel that 6.0 was shoved out the door
"before its time" by the marketeers. If anything 6.2 is even less well
integrated and there are serious problems with the STEPUP program.

If you have a perfectly pristine MS-DOS 6.0 installation and did not download
the "supplemental disk" with EDLIN, COMP, etc. everything will be fine, else
there may be a few surprises:

Apparently, the stepup program makes no initial check of the MS-DOS 6.0
installation before having at it. Some of the first files "updated" are
the two system files IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS. One of the last is COMMAND.COM.
If an abort occurs in the middle, you could have aproblem.

As each program is processed, the STEPUP program apparently checks the
length of each file before patching and will refuse to patch a program
that is "incorrect". Since the old files only work with 6.0, guess what ?

This means that if an .EXE was infected by a virus (see there is some
revelance to V-L) and the size was not restored exactly, guess what again.

Next, on slower machines there is a long pause around the 80% done mark
(so long on a 286 that I thought the machine had hung - took almost 5
minutes to continue). If you reboot there (this is before COMMAND.COM
is fixed), GWA.

Finally, any unpatched program such as those on the supplemental disk
will refuse to run since they are for 6.0 and not 6.2 (now if you
unpack the program and patch the CMP AX,0006 that follows the 30 CD 21
string (worked for me 8*) to CMP AX,1406, you might not need SETVER (which
IMHO is too long already). Caveat y'all.

As noted, the update to MSAV promised in the .TXT is just not there.

Even so, it does seem to be worth the price ($0.00) if just for v5.0 of
SmartDrv that claims to now include CD-ROM caching (my son says the voices in
the 7th Guest still skip though).

You're probably seeing a new variant of November 17 (AKA NOV17).  Some
festering (fill in the blank) in Italy has been producing variants of
this virus, and we keep on seeing them, occasionally in real
incidents.  Your best approach is probably to simply delete infected
files and replace them with originals.

So, from someone who complains about improper test results, he offers
test results from November of this year, which tests a product over a
year old against fresh versions of other products.

NAV 3.0 was announced in September of this year!!!!  I know you didn't
do the tests.  But you did make this idiotic conclusion.

While I am not familiar with your situation, I believe I can offer some
information that might be helpful:

We have "in-the-wild" reports (and sample) of a NOV17.800 virus.  That is,
it is a variant of the November 17th virus which is 800 bytes long.  It
happens to also trigger on January 1st and not November 17th when it will
overwrite certain hard disk system area sectors.

The fact that your report indicates the "November 17th" but not quite would
lead me to point you in this direction.  The 855 strain is the most popular
and the repairs for this virus is most likely based on the virus having a
length of 855.  If the virus is only 800 bytes long, the repair would not
be correct anyway.

False positive?  Most likely not!

The definition for NOV17.800 with repair is in the December update of NAV
3.0.

I run in MS Windows most of the time. I know that F-PROT's virstop
scanning utility won't pop infection alerts into Windows. I'm
wondering, though, whether it will let you know about a possible
infection after you exit Windows or not.

Subject: NetShield 1.55 Question (PC)

I work for a Novell Reseller, and recently we decided to try NetShield
to see how well it works.  We tried it once almost a year ago, but
weren't very pleased.  At any rate, we're satisfied with the 1.55
release, with one minor problem.  If we set it to scan all incoming
files, nothing happens.  Scanning both or outgoing works as expected.

Is this a problem with NetShield (we had a similar problem last time),
or an incompatiblility with 3.12?

Subject: Virus that affects printing only? (PC)

Hi,

Sorry if this is a FAQ - I'm new to this group.  I am having a strange
problem printing under Windows 3.1.  I had an HP IIP printer and it
started messing up the printing on documents and faxes.  The way it
looked, I thought there was an internal memory problem with the printer.
Since the printer was quite old, I went out and bought a brand new
HP 4.  Now I am having similar problems on my new printer.  Everything
else on my machine seems to work fine.  I've run f-prot 2.09 and CPAV
2.1 on my machine before and found nothing (maybe these programs also
got infected?).  Is it possible that a virus could cause strange printing
problems?

Thanks in advance for any ideas.

Regards,
Ralph Wolman

I think that the best you could do without doing too much programming
(if you consider batch files... programming), would be to merely make
a batch file that executes the debug with the file redirection.

On my hard drive, I have a directory called, "c:\dos", and another called
"c:\utils".  both of these are in my path statement.  I could merely make
a batch file which would be in the utils directory, say, readboot.bat,
which would merely contain the line  debug < c:\utils\goodbt, where
goodbt is file which has the script.  A similar batch file could be
written for putting the boot sector to a floppy.  And, if you don't
want to see the debug stuff, simply put a "> nul".
(At the end of the same line)

Subject: McAfee VSHIELD vs Frisk VIRSTOP ??? (PC)

What are the pros and cons of McAfee's VSHIELD vs Frisk's VIRSTOP
for resident anti-virus protection ?

I have licenses for both programs in our department at the University of
Washington.  I use them in our computer labs.

I recommend Frisk's F-PROT to users for scanning their disks, because it
is easy to use (menu driven), it can both detect and remove viruses, it
can supply information on viruses, and it is fast (tho' release 2.09f
seems a bit slower than earlier versions).

I recommend (and use) McAfee's VSHIELD for resident anti-virus protection,
because the last time I tried Frisk's VIRSTOP I found it unsatisfactory.
(Unfortunately that was a year or so ago, and I don't remember the
details.)  It seemed less thorough.  One example: it did not check for a
boot-sector-infected diskette in the A: drive on CTL-ALT-DEL reboot.
It did not inform the user that it was checking for viruses, which tells
the user what's going on and reminds them of the virus protection issue.

Now I am installing McAfee's VSHIELD 108B (even tho' 109 was just
released), and I am again having questions and reservations about VSHIELD.
Basically, I feel that the program is becoming so complex and difficult to
use that I am again considering using VIRSTOP.  For example, VSHIELD
documentation states:

  - p.  2: "The VSHWIN program allows VSHIELD to display messages
           while Windows 3.x is running."

  - p. 12: "The /WINDOWS option [using VSHWIN] allows VSHIELD to display
           messages under Windows 3.X in a Windows dialogue box. ...
           ... This option now installs the Windows display program
           and needs to be run once.
           ... For the VSHWIN program to display messages under Windows,
           VSHIELD must be run with the /ACCESS switch."

COMMENTS:

  0.  It is -not- clear from the documentation whether the VSHWIN program
is required "to display messages under Windows" or only if the user wants
those messages displayed "in a Windows dialogue box".  I don't think it's
worth having a memory resident program running at all times just to put
the VSHIELD messages in a dialogue box.

  1.  This is a change from the way the /WINDOWS option worked under
release 102, and it requires users who had been using 102 to change their
autoexec.bat file; they are likely to neglect this change.

  2.  The new implementation of the /WINDOWS option requires the user to
use it -once only- (to install the VSHWIN program), and then not use the
/WINDOWS option on subsequent everyday reboots; not a good design!  And
it changes the users Windows environment (WIN.INI file).  More hassle.

  3a.  Using the VSHWIN program -requires- the /ACCESS option.  Why???

  3b.  Because /ACCESS cannot be used with /SWAP, the user is prevented
from using that option which would save lots of RAM (UMBs may be full).

  4.  /ACCESS cannot be used with /BOOT.  /ACCESS "is intended for high
risk environments such as open-use computer labs...".  It seems that
/BOOT would also be suitable for the same high risk environments.  Yet
the two options are incompatible.

  5.  /COPY "cannot be used with the /ACCESS, /BOOT, or /SWAP options".

Deciphering the documentation and configuring the program is too damn much
trouble!

Comments from users of VSHIELD and VIRSTOP (or both!) would be welcome.
Thanks,  -Mike Ramey

Subject: "Wrapper" (PC)

The 3 hits on "Wrapper" are known false positives, sorry.  In a
marathon day of analysis I accidentally (and unknowingly) included a
scan string for degarblers (decryptors) produced by a tool that a few
shareware programs use to hide the contents of programs.  The scan
string is for the simple lodsw/xor ax,foo/stosw degarbler that this
protection program attaches to programs.  IBM AntiVirus 1.04 does not
issue this false positive.

The "V516" hit on norman/ad.exe is another story.  Is this program an
anti-virus program, or associated with an anti-virus program?  (A
company with NORMAN in its name recently was boasting that they had
the only shipping product that detected Satanbug, which was simply
untrue when the add copy was circulating.)  If it's an anti-virus
program, and current versions of f-prot/scan find nothing, then it's
probably a false positive on scan strings left "in the clear" in
ad.exe.  But this is just a guess.

"Using McAfee Associates Software for Safe Computing", Jacobsen, 1990

There are many books which are aimed at helping you use specific commercial
programs.  Usually, however, such books are either targeted at "dummies" or
purpose to reveal secret or undocumented features.  The title here seems to
suggest both a generic goal, safe computing, and a specific means.  Those "in
the know" of course, realize that safety here is being limited to protection
against viral programs.

Certain other works have been associated with the company named here, and have
resulted in rather unfortunate products.  In the Foreword and Preface we see
the game "rah, rah" chauvinism.  It is, therefore, a rather pleasant surprise
to find that chapter one, in defining viral programs, doesn't do a bad job.  A
computer virus is said to execute with other programs, but that explanation is
immediately extended with a lucid and factual account of the boot sequence on
MS-DOS computers.  It even distinguishes between the boot sector and the master
boot record (although Jacobson loses points for referring to the MBR as the
partition table.)

The rigorous will find errors in the first chapter.  Program infection is shown
strictly in terms of an appending virus.  Although FAT or system viri (referred
to as "cluster-point") are described, companion viri are not.  The statement is
made that "viruses may include a Trojan Horse":  the definition is that of a
trojan, the examples are clearly logic bombs.

Chapter two is entitled "Planning a Virus Control Program".  This would seem to
be concerned with establishing the level of risk for a company and producing
policy and procedures for virus protection.  Unfortunately, the detail included
here is very sparse.  Some extremely broad guidelines are given, but the reader
is literally left with more questions than answers after reading this chapter.
Eventually a companion volume by the same author is mentioned as dealing with
the details.

At the beginning of chapter two one is told that chapter three, "Virus
Prevention Techniques" gives the answers for protecting a single computer.
Rule one:  write protect everything.  Rule two:  Buy SCAN.  Rule three:  buy
*more* SCAN.  Rule four:  have extra copies of SCAN around (be sure to buy
extra licences.)

Chapters four to seven are basically reworkings of the documentation for
VSHIELD, SCAN, CLEAN and the network uses thereof.  One immediately asks, of
course, which version was used.  One is not immediately answered:  chapter
eight indicates, and nine supports, the presumption that version 85 was used.
In the mailing with my review copy I received a letter indicating that update
files are produced.  The files, USINGxxx.ZIP, where xxx is the version number,
are stated to be available on the McAfee BBS and the McAfee forum on
Compuserve.  Apparently the updating is not constant:  the "current" version of
the McAfee products, as this was received, was 106, and had been for some time.
According to the letter, the "current" version was USING102 and USING106 was
due out shortly.

Chapters eight and nine tell you how to get technical support, first, and a
copy of the program, second.  The answers are to call the McAfee BBS, the
McAfee Compuserve forum, or call McAfee Associates and buy it.  An order form
for the McAfee products is bound into the back of the book:  it will surprise
no one that the publisher of the book is a McAfee agent.

Chapter ten is entitled "The Ten Most Common Viruses".  Those familiar with the
sometimes unfortunate accuracy of the VSUM lists will recognize the entries.
In a listing at the end of the chapter, BRAIN and Stoned are included in a list
of "stealth" viri which can cause "catastrophic damage" or "cause all files to
become infected during the scanning process".

Essentially, what you have here is printed (and dated) documentation for the
McAfee programs.  Since the functions of the programs change less frequently
than the scan strings, most of the material is still relevant.  Problems can be
checked against the current McAfee documentation.  As such, this may be a
useful book, fairly reasonably priced considering the cost of the programs
themselves.  One shortcoming is that the network section still relies on the
combination of stand-alone software:  the NLM versions are not mentioned.  In
contrast to most "third party" books, though, there is little here that will
either change the performance or ease the use, of the product under discussion.
