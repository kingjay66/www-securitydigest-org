In my tests, F-Prot always ranks at or near the top.
 
I like F-Prot because it is very good at telling the user specificly which 
virus happens to be present. 

Some scanners rank all variants under the same name. This may be OK for 
some viruses. but some variants can be destructive like the 1704 Format. 
If I have that virus on my hard drive, I want to kill all specimens ASAP 
before it tries to format my hard drive

Anti-viral products should be tested fairly, but testing against 11

I hope that they perform better tests next time, or not produce tests at

Most boot sector viruses hide in the boot sector of floppies, but on hard 
drives, they hide in the partion table.
 
The Partition table is never touched by a format.
 
A fair way to get rid of boot sector viruses without using AV softwarem or 
low level formatting the hard drive, is to boot clean from a DOS 5.0 
bootable diskette, then issue the following command.
 
FDISK/MBR.
 
Hope this helps.

Well we had quite a little crop in Singapore this year, which according to
the Straits Times which is often wildly inaccurate about virus attacks,
hit car dealers in particular.

I know I shouldn;t feel this way, but if there HAVE to be viruses, car
dealers seem a suitable victim!

The point about Singapore is taht public offices work on a Saturday

And I say, NO !  As long as the scanner that calls it Blivet is capable of 
making the distinction between variants of the virus, and clean it correctly (
as I also said in my partly- quoated-by-you article). The information is of no 
use to the user if the virus is variant Vir.11.a234.5-A or  Vir.234.87.1-D/45
of it (by any relatioship tree that you can invent).

Does this action is considered user responsibility? If so, it's a bad atitude. 
You cannot consider all users as capable of making the decision.

You tell me, I do it all the time. I only don't bother sending it to Patricia 
Hoffman due to the enless conversations that you can read in Virnet about that 
issue.

Well, the answer to this is easy too. Did you here of the 1963, 1049, 1260, 
1530, 1677, 757, 903, 1024 (do I have to write more?) viruses?

Not all viruses have a name attached to them. Especially the kind that has no 
specific behaviour. Those will usualy get their
"size name".

Hello everyone.

Regarding the PC-Magazine's article and Editors Choice.
Well, you know what they say:

Don't you think its about time that these kind of tests should expire? Is it a 
whise idea to test modern Anti-Viruses with the oldest test in the book? Is it 
still a valid test?

Believe it, there are more. As for the 70 or 80 common ones, it could be even 
less, but the point is that if you are a user, and you are infected by the 1% 
that is not on the selebrity list, you will still have a 100% major problem in 
your hands. That's maybe the reason why the test is not valid. 8-)

Besides these 11 common viruses may represent the status in the USA, but 
definitly not in any other country, since viruses spread differently in 
various countries. For example: DIR-2 and 1963 are the most widly spread in 
Israel at the moment, but no one (almost) had seen them in France or Germany. 
Therefore the Benchmark made by PC-Mag' has no real meaning in most countries 
of the world, except comercial.

I think it's time to establish a new way of testing an Anti Virus, and I'm 
calling all of you, Virus researchers to initiate the process.

Subject: Virus that infects while Scanning? (PC)

Please do not get alarmed by this.  This is not rumormonging, but
is a serious question.  I do not know if this virus exists, and
for this reason I am asking about it.

A friend of mine recently (a few months ago) told me about what
appeared to be a computer virus his machine had caught that (in some
manner) appeared to infect the files of his hard disk just after they
were scanned.  His claim was that it dodged the scan by taking itself
out of memory during the memory check (McAffee) and then reloaded into
memory and removed itself from the infected file during the scan of
that file.  After that, it would infect every .exe that was scanned.
Thus the process of scanning actually infected the whole drive.

I don't know if there is a virus out there that does this.  Is there?
If so, is there a way to protect against it?  He said that Mcaffee didn't
pick it up. (I don't know what version he used).

Sorry for being vague, and also sorry for wasting your time if this
virus doesn't exist.  But... does it?

Hi Eugene!

Your info about the FORM virus has been correct, I guess except to these line:

 > If you work with a hard disk, the data can be lost.

How? FORM does not write data to the hard disk, except of its viral code to 
the active DOS Bootsector ant that bootsector to another unused sector.

Well, you souldn't go as specific as sub-function 00h.

Viruses also monitor service 03h and undocumented 01h that are used to load 
overlays.

04B is general enough.

Look. In order for a file to infect a virus it must either add itself to the 
file, or overwrite or replace the first file's cluster (known methods of 
infection, correct me if I'm missing anything). If you run a CRC check DAILY, 
you WILL locate these changing. What you're saying is true only if I had let 
my system get infected, and only THEN, after the viruses had already started 
to activate, I ran the tests.

If you run this test daily and consistantly, I think it might come out quite 
effective.

By unloading, I don't mean removing from memory. I mean disabling - ie. making 
as if the thing was never loaded, and therefore whatever protection it was 
supplying, does not exist anymore.

I once started a thread about this in the FidoNet 80XXX folder. We had some 
pretty good ideas there, and I had something that would free all memory by the 
program, minus 5 bytes per each interrupt you are hooking.

If you wish to get more information about this, netmail me on any of the 
addresses on my signature.

Subject: Michelangelo protection (CVP)

HISVIRY.CVP   930210
 
                      Michelangelo protection
 
A number of suggestions were made during early 1992 as to how to
deal with Michelangelo.  Since so very many antiviral programs,
commercial, shareware and freeware, identified the virus, it was odd
the lengths that people were willing to go to in order to avoid this
obvious step.  The "computer expert" in one of our local papers
wrote an article on Michelangelo for his weekly column.  It was
packed with errors, and he was roundly chastised by many people.  A
large contingent of his detractors were local BBS sysops who urged
him to simply get one of the shareware scanners and make certain. 
His response, the next week, was to publish a column stating that no
self respecting business would be caught dead with a modem.  Among
the other recommendations of the high and mighty:
 
Backups - *always* a good idea.  And, given that Michelangelo is a
boot sector infector, it wouldn't be able to "store" on a tape
backup.  On diskettes it would.  Even worse, many popular backup
programs use proprietary "non-DOS" disk formats for reasons of speed
and additional storage.  These, if "infected" by Michelangelo, would
become unusable.
 
Change computer clock - if Michelangelo was set to go off on March
6, just make sure March 6 never happened.  Part of the trouble with
this was that many people did not understand the difference between
the MS-DOS clock and the "system" clock read by interrupt 1Ah.  The
MS-DOS DATE command did not always alter the system clock.  Certain
network connected machines also have "time server" functions, so
that the date would be reset to conform to the network.  Finally,
1992 was a leap year, and many "clocks" did not deal with it
properly.  Thus, for many computers, "March 6" came on the Thursday,
not Friday.  (An even sillier suggestion was to "test" for
Michelangelo by setting the date to March 6 and then rebooting the
computer.  This is known as "Michelangelo roulette".)
 
OS/2, Novell or UNIX boxes - Michelangelo is widely perceived as an
MS-DOS virus.  This is not quite correct.  It is, rather, a BIOS
virus.  It can "infect" Intel CPU BIOS/ISA compatible machines,
although many will no longer run after the infection.
 
Stay off modems - neither the master/partition boot record nor the
boot sector are identifiable files under MS-DOS.  Therefore, neither
can be transmitted as files over a modem or bulletin board by the
average user.  Although "dropper" programs are theoretically
possible, if they exist at all they are extremely rare.  The danger
of getting a Michelangelo infection from a BBS is therefore so small
that for all practical purposes it does not exist.  The prohibition
against bulletin boards merely cuts you off from a major source of
advice and utility software.

Subject: March 1992 and the media

HISVIRZ.CVP   930210
 
                Michelangelo - March 1992 and Media
 
In the fall of 1989, there was a large amount of media attention
given to two Jerusalem variants, Datacrime and "Columbus Day".  The
promotion appeared to be instigated by a particular antiviral
service vendor.  It turned out that these viri had far less
distribution than was being claimed.  I suspect that the media has
had a distrust of "virus hype" stemming from this date.
 
However, the epidemic of Michelangelo in the spring of 1992 could
not be denied.  Vendors were making unsubstantiated claims for the
numbers of infections which, in retrospect, turn out to have been
surprisingly accurate.  More importantly, the research community as
a whole were seeing large numbers of infections.  The public was
seeing them as well, since no less than thirteen companies shipped
commercial products which turned out to be infected with the
Michelangelo virus.
 
"Instant experts" arose to fill the need for press releases,
confusing Michelangelo with every other virus that ever put a
message on a screen.  (One such "consultant" called a researcher for
a "professional courtesy consultation" -- to ask what a "boot
sector" was.)  Accounting firms (why are accountants supposed to be
so "computerate"?) trumpeted the injunction not to call bulletin
boards, heedless of the fact that BSIs don't *spread* via modem. 
The media darlings, of course, took full advantage, but even I had
twenty seconds of my fifteen minutes of fame used up on the tube. 
(But who got his picture in the paper?  My brother, who did not
*believe* in viral programs, to whom I had given a copy of a
scanner, and who found the computer in his church to be infected --
at 11:50 pm on March 5.)
 
(Two producers of commercial antiviral programs released crippled
"freeware" versions of their scanners.  These I view with some
disfavour.  The programs *did* briefly mention that they only
checked for Michelangelo, but certainly gave users the impression
that they were checking the whole system.)
 
Because of the media attention, a number of checks were made that
would have been done otherwise.  Hundreds, even thousands, of copies
of Michelangelo were found in single institutions.  Infection rates
ranged from one per thousand to 25% and more in some parts of
Europe.  Some reports, such as the infection of an entire network of
pharmacy computers in South Africa, were later found to be spurious,
but estimates of millions of copies had a sound basis.  (There were
no reports of Michelangelo detected in Japan beforehand, but a small
number of computers were wiped out on the Friday.  This is
particularly interesting in view of the fact that MITI had been
loudly proclaiming that Michelangelo would not be a problem in
Japan.)
 
Having found, and removed, a great many copies, the number of "hits"
on March 6 was not spectacular.  Hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of
machines were struck, but the damage was nothing as great as it
might have been.  Predictably, perhaps, media reports on March 6
started to dismiss the Michelangelo scare as another overhyped
rumour, completely missing the reality of what had transpired.
