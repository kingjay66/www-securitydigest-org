Well, the number of infections has increased somewhat, compared to two
years ago, but the number of people using anti-virus software has also
increased, so more infections are detected.

There is also the question of how large percentage of the infections are
reported to you, and whether clean-ups are sufficiently thorough.

Still, even though there is an increase it is by no means an exponential
one.

Ktark, judging by your post to me, you are arguing for the sake of

If the gun analogy is one created by the anti-virus crowd, then why are
you so quick to defend it?  No matter who created the analogy, it doesn't

Well, I have not found a virus that would not be destructive in some
environment. Period. This sounds like the gentleman a few years ago
who said the the 4096 was not destructive, it was when the user ran
CHKDSK/F that corruption occured.

To me the biggest difference between a gun and a virus is that when I fire
an Automag, there is a limit to my sphere of destruction. Eventually the
bullet will dissipate its energy in some fashion and cease to be destructive.
"Eventually" can be measured in seconds.

In counterpoint a virus *never* stops and can have undreamed effects in the
future. There is discussion today about making the computers in cars
field programmable & guess what is the basis for the big GM roll-around.

I can command the idle speed in a new Corvette to be anything I want it to be
with a Tech-1. Suppose a 5000 rpm command occured in traffic ? Impossible ?
Not at all, just takes the wrong parameters.

A big business today is replacement PROM chips for cars. What if a PC-based
PROM programmer had an "extra added attraction". Unlikely ? You do not have
enough appendages for the number of manufacturers who accidently shipped
viruses on disks.

I am sorry for not being able to reply to your main question - how
good InVircible/V-Care is - because I have no experience with it.
However, I would strongly advise you to take any claims like the above
with a large grain of salt.

It is true that anti-virus packaged based on integrity checking don't
need to be updated as often as the scanners. It is not true, however,
that they don't have to be updated at all - every program becomes
obsolete with time. Second, while integrity checking is a stronger
line of anti-virus defense than scanning, it is certainly not good
enough as a *single* line of defense. The best is to combine it with
scanning - scan all incomming software and control the integrity of
the existing software. And, if a package adopts this strategy, it
will still need to be updated - at least the scanner part of it. If it
doesn't adopt it - then it is weaker than a combined system. In the
product mentioned by you relies on integrity checking alone, I can bet
you that (a) I can design a virus that will be able to infect a system
infected by it and pass unnoticed (actually, I'll probably be able to
invent 3-4 different ways to bypass the system, but I am making a safe
bet <grin>) and (b) it doesn't protect against at least some of the
already existing viruses.

If you doubt in the above, ask the producer how the package protects
your system against Brain - one of the first IBM PC viruses. Just for
information, Brain is a diskette-only boot sector infector. If the
producer says "ah, but we are protecting only your hard disk", ask
them how would their product protect your hard disk from a virus that
infects like Brain, but also corrupts only the data files on your hard
disk and only when they are being modified by DOS.

BTW, one of the problems with the integrity-based system is that they
detect the infection only after-the-fact - which in some cases might
be too late. Like if you get infected by Michelangelo on March 6. :-)

It is just as effective as under plain DOS, although a bit slower.
Also, it might not be able to detect in memory a virus that is running
in another DOS box, if Windows is started in protected mode, but I am
not quite certain about that. In any case, it shouldn't cause any
problems in your situation.

Please, folks, read the FAQ for information about how to ask such
questions. How do you know that it is the reaper virus? Which scanner
has reported it? Which version?

May I suggest that you use some better anti-virus package? You should
take a look at F-Prot, TBAV, SCAN - all are shareware (F-Prot is even
freeware for individual use) and are available from the usual ftp
sites.

Searching through my database, I can see a virus, which SCAN 109
calls "Reaper [Rea]" and F-Prot 2.10 calls "Hungarian (ARCV.Reaper)".
Do you mean this one? It is a memory-resident, 1072-byte long EXE and
COM semi-stealth fast infector. On August 15 it prints the message

"Reaper Man.
(c) 92, Apache Warrior, ARCV Press."

It doesn't contain intentionally destructive routines and the message
can be seen in the infected files, because the virus doesn't use
encryption. It doesn't infect files matching the specification *D.* -
in particular, COMMAND.COM.

That's true, although I have been unable to replicate the second one.

The FAQ is slightly out-of-date. What you have heard is true -
currently there are two Windows-specific viruses.

But the FAQ is also correct, in some sense. The second file doesn't
modify the applications it infects, so it doesn't need to know about
the NewEXE format. Only the first one does.

> What is the name of that one?  The names that I was given are:

Correct again. WinVir was the first one, Twitch is the second one (the
one I was unable to replicate - maybe my sample is corrupted).

> figure it might just be a stretch on the part of the journalist to
> define a "Windows virus".

No, the journalist is right. There are indeed two Windows-specific
viruses and indeed those are their names. The first one is a
non-resident virus, which infects the Windows applications properly
but disinfects them when they are executed. It infects only in the
current directory, and this, combined with the non-residency, makes it
very unlikely to spread.

The second virus is of the companion type - it renames the original
applications to have OVL extensions and copies itself under their
original name.

Both viruses are not only Windows-specific; they also *require*
Windows, in order to run.

No, it won't. But I don't see why you need this - just boot from a
MS-DOS 5.0+ system diskette before using FDISK/MBR. If you have a
version of FDISK that supports this option, you should have the
appropriate system diskette too - they come together.

If she is *really* that good, she could do any of the following:

1) Use a bootable MS-DOS 5.0+ diskette with FDISK.

2) Patch FDISK to run under any DOS version.

3) Fetch Padgett's Fix Utilities and use it to recover the MBR.

Huh? Just boot from a DOS 5.0 diskette before running FDISK and the
problem will go away.

Of course, because it changes only the Partiton Table *data*; not the
code where the virus resides.

It depends on the virus. After booting from a DOS 5.0+ diskette, make
sure that the DIR command still can access the hard disk. If you get
"Invalid drive C:" or something similar - DON'T use FDISK/MBR, because
it is likely to cause damage.

As far as I recall, SETVER is not available before DOS 4.0. And the
first solution is much better anyway.

It's handy that you asked; I'll use the opportunity to post a warning.
After Christmas I am going to "disappear" from the net in general and
comp.virus in particular. I *really* have to concentrate on writing my
Ph.D. If I don't present something substantial in written form in
March, I will be kicked out of here in July. :-(

So, after Christmas, I will stop posting to comp.virus and replying to

Posting it here is out-of-question. Making it available via ftp - I'll
consider that option, but I am not promissing anything.

I don't know what "NT AS" is. We do have a Windows NT system and
another one with OS/2. Currently, a group of students is doing virus
experiments with OS/2. The intermediate result that I heard today is
that FDISK somehow manages to remove an MBR infection (by
Parity_Boot.A), if you change the active partition. Those are still
non-verified results, so please consider them as rumors and don't rely
on them - it is quite probable that we have messed something up.

Currently, no Windows NT experiments are performed. I certainly don't
have the time to do it, and the computer is used for work too.
Probably we'll do something in this direction in the future.

Any disinfection software that does not perform exact identification,
or at least nearly exact identification when removing viruses, is
junk. No, worse, it is dangerous.

What do you mean exactly be "repairing the partition table"? Just
changed the information about the partitions with FDISK? This does not
touch the virus code in the MBR. And what do you mean by
"reformatting"? Using the command FORMAT? That does not touch the MBR
either. You should boot from a write-protected uninfected DOS 5.0 (or
above) system diskette, make sure that the hard disk is still
accessible, and if it is, use the command FDISK/MBR. If it isn't - you
should ask for expert advice.

That's kinda strange, because F-Prot should identify this virus and
SCAN should at least detect it (usually as "Monkey [Mon]", sometimes
as "Generic MBR [GenP]").

ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de:/pub/virus/progs/killmnk3.zip

That's rather strange, as I pointed out, but I am unable to say more
without examining a sample of the virus.

Hmm... You almost certainly have a false positive or at least a
misidentification. When F-Prot says "(?)", this means that it is using
just a simple scan string, with no guarantees for identification
whatsoever. (Frisk will correct me if I am wrong about this.) On the
other hand, Hidenowt is an obscure virus of Polish or English origin
(I believe), and I find it rather unlikely that it has made it to
Cornell.

I would suggest you to try the latest version of F-Prot and SCAN -
2.10 and 109 respectively. F-Prot 2.10 no longer reports this virus
with a question mark (which means that the identification has been
improved) and SCAN detects it as "1757 [1757]".

The virus has been described in both "Virus Bulletin" and "Virus News
International", but you probably don't have access to those sources.
In short, it is a resident, EXE and COM infector, with a lot of
obfuscated code, which actually doesn't hide any signifficant payload
- - from where the virus name has been derived. But you are almost
certainly not infected by it.

As Marilyn says, viruses are a lovely scapegoat, but she mentions
Windows 3.1, and I would be checking if they have write caching
enabled on Smartdrive.  This is the default (though I gather
MicroSoft have seen the error of their ways on DOS 6.2).  Copy a
file to another name, and watch the drive light.  If you
immediately return to the DOS prompt, but the drive light does not
flash till a few seconds later, write caching is enabled.  If a
user saves her/his work, and then switches off before DOS has got
around to saving the files the work will be lost. If the PC is
switched off while the write is in progress you can get the
symptoms described.

If you use the command SMARTDRIVE C D ...  where C, D, etc are
the physical drives, write caching will be disabled.

Ok, I need som help here (for a PC).

A co-worker of my mother had her machine come up with the message (someting
like), 'Your Computer is Now Stoned'.

First of all Stoned virus, right?

Second, her (the co-worker's) and my machine shared a disk (at some point,
before or after infection).

Question.  Does anyone know where there is a good P.D. piece of software
out there that would detect this thing.

I'm currently using (not P.D. I belive) Virus Clean V1.09  Now its my
feeling that is should detect it (if not, then atleast the existance of
'something'), and since it hasn't that it didn't come from me......(or to me).

Any help out there?

Monkey virus really is a pain, at least if you have more than
one hard drive.  I got a couple of infected disks from a client
and tried to play with it on my system...  Big mistake!
F-prot and Tbav weren't much help since they couldn't see my
hard drives after a clean floppy boot.  I got KILLMONK from
oak.oakland.edu and it did a nice job of cleaning my C: drive
while I was infected, but then I had no D: drive...  Next I used
Norton Disk Doctor to fix the D: drive.  All finally seems ok,
except that F-Prot is now saying something about a new or
modified Stoned on D:...  TBAV and ScamV don't find anything
wrong with it though.  Next time I do a backup I'll probably
just reformat it.  Then again, I could just infect it again
and try to clean it with something better.  Any ideas?
These are two physical drives BTW....

Subject: Is this a virus or hardware problem? (PC)

I have been having a problem with my PC recently. My PC is a 486 DX 33MHZ,
4 MB ram and 120 MB hard disk. The system is about 1 year old.
The symptom is:
It does not boot from the hard disk some times, not always. Every time when
it doesn't boot, I got a message saying "Non system disk, replace". It
cannot boot from the hard disk. Then I had to boot from a floppy and then
I make the C: drive bootable. It will work for a few days and then the problem
happens again when I turn the power on. I have to repeat the whole process
to make the C: bootable again. I run DOS 5 and WIndows 3.1 on the system.
I've never had any other problem with the system.

So I thought it might be a virus, then I ran McAfee's ViroScan and Norton's
Anti Virus, nothing was found. I checked the disk and no problem was found.
Even at the time it doesn't boot from the harddisk, the boot sector passes
every disk test.

I can not figure out what is going on. Hope I can get some helps from you
guys. Thanks.

Actually, the order I would recommend should be slightly different:

1) Write-protect it

2) Back it up twice to two clean disks.

3) Lock the original and one of the backup copies in two different
places

4) Scan the second backup copy.

5) Install from the scanned backup copy.

Correction!

1. Write Protect it.

2. Check it.

3. etc.

If you check it before you write protect it, and find a virus,
the supplier will say "Oh? You must have infected it!"

If you write protect it, then check it, you can say "No! It's
your (favorite expletive deleted) virus; I write protected the
disk before I did anything with it!"

Subject: Tripwire Version 1.1 released (UNIX)

Announcing the release of version 1.1 of Tripwire!  This version
supersedes all previous versions of Tripwire.  Version 1.1 includes
many new features, small performance improvements, and several bug
fixes.  This version also comes complete with a rationale/design
document (finally!).

Version 1.1 of Tripwire is probably the final release of Tripwire for
some time to come.  We have not heard any new bug reports or
suggestions for new features in some time, so there is little "outside
reason" to modify the program.  Gene Kim is graduating and moving on
to graduate school elsewhere, so there is also little "internal
reason" to continue to tinker with the code.

Enclosed below is a brief description of what Tripwire is, a
description of how to get a copy of the source code, and a list of new
features added since the Version 1.0.5 release.

We greatly appreciate the time and effort expended by all the people
who beta-tested various versions of Tripwire over the last year.
Without the contributions and reports of these people, we are certain
that the package would not be as complete as it is currently.  We have
tried to acknowledge all our testers and contributors in the
documentation and Changlog file in this distribution; our sincere
apologies if we forgot anyone.

Also, our thanks to COAST sponsors and sponsors of COAST research
projects who helped fund this project, directly or indirectly.  This
includes especially Bell Northern Research, Trident Data Systems
and the US Air Force.  (Be sure to read the COAST.info file!)

What is Tripwire?
- -----------------
Tripwire is an integrity-monitor for Unix systems.  It uses several
checksum/message-digest/secure-hash/signature routines to detect
changes to files, as well as monitoring selected items of
system-maintained information.  The system also monitors for changes
in permissions, links, and sizes of files and directories.  It can be
made to detect additions or deletions of files from watched
directories.

The configuration of Tripwire is such that the system/security
administrator can easily specify files and directories to be monitored
or to be excluded from monitoring, and to specify files which are
allowed limited changes without generating a warning.  Tripwire can
also be configured with customized signature routines for
site-specific checks.

Tripwire, once installed on a clean system, can detect changes from
intruder activity, unauthorized modification of files to introduce
backdoor or logic-bomb code, and virus activity (if any were to exist)
in the Unix environment.

Tripwire is provided as source code with documentation.  The system,
as delivered, performs no changes to system files and does not require
root privilege to run (in the general case).  The code has been
extensively tested at many sites. Tripwire should work on almost any
version of Unix, from Xenix on 80386-based machines to Cray and ETA-10
supercomputers.

Tripwire may be used without charge, but it may not be sold or
modified for sale.   Tripwire was written as a project under the
auspices of the COAST Project at Purdue University.  The primary
author was Gene Kim, with the aid and under the direction of Gene
Spafford (COAST Director).

Where to Get Tripwire
- ---------------------
Copies of the Tripwire distribution may be ftp'd from
ftp.cs.purdue.edu from the directory pub/spaf/COAST/Tripwire.  The
distribution is available as a compressed tar file, and as
uncompressed shar kits.  The shar kit form of Tripwire version 1.1
will also be posted to comp.sources.unix on the Usenet.

A mailserver exists for distribution and to provide a means of
reporting bugs.  To use the mail server, send e-mail to
"tripwire-request@cs.purdue.edu" with a message body consisting solely
of the word "help".  The server will respond with instructions on how
to get sources, patches (if any are issued), and how to report a bug
(which we hope doesn't happen!).

Questions, comments, complaints, bugfixes, etc may be directed to:
gkim@cs.purdue.edu (Gene Kim)
spaf@cs.purdue.edu (Gene Spafford)

Changes from Version 1.0.x to Version 1.1
- -----------------------------------------
    Version 1.1 considerably upgrades the functionality of Tripwire.
All known bugs have been fixed, and many selected features have been
added at the request of Tripwire users.

    Among the major changes are:

	- rewrite of the "-update" command.
	- addition of an "-interactive" command that prompts the user
		whether a changed file's database entry should be
		updated.
	- addition of a "-loosedir" command for quieter Tripwire runs.
	- support for monotonically growing files in tw.config.
	- addition of comprehensive test suite to test Tripwire
		functionalities.
	- hooks for external services (i.e., compression, encryption,
		networking) through "-cfd" and "-dfd" options.
	- addition of the new NIST SHA/SHS signature algorithm.
	- corrections and changes in the MD2, MD4, MD5, CRC32,
		and Snefru signature routines.
	- addition of a more rigorous signature test suite.
	- more error checking in tw.config @@directives.
	- siggen replaces sigfetch.
	- addition of a tw.config file for Solaris v2.2 (SVR4).
	- change of base-64 alphabet to conform to standards.
	- preprocessor macro fixes.

  New Tripwire database format:
  =============================

    The Tripwire database format has changed slightly since v1.0, using
a different base-64 alphabet.  Use the twconvert program to convert
v1.0 databases to v1.1 databases (located in the ./aux directory).

  Updating the Tripwire database:
  ===============================

    There has been a major rewrite/rethink of the "tripwire -update"
command, as well as the addition of a "tripwire -interactive" command
which allows the user to interactively select which database entries
should be updated.  No vestiges of the "-add" or "-delete" command
remain, since the "-update" command now automatically deletes and adds
files.

    However, the preferred way of keeping Tripwire databases in sync
with the filesystems is using the "-interactive" command.  A Tripwire
session using Interactive mode might look like:

    6:25am (flounder) tw/src 1006 %% tripwire -interactive

    Tripwire prompts the user whether the database entry of the
current file should be updated to match the current file information.
Pressing either 'y' or 'n' either updates the current file or skips to
the next file.  Pressing 'Y' or 'N' applies your answer to the entire
entry.  (I.e., if /etc is changed, typing 'Y' will not only update /etc,
but it will also files update all the files in /etc.)

  Tripwire exit codes:
  ====================

    Tripwire exit status can be interpreted by the following mask:

	1:	run-time error.  aborted.
	2:	files added
	4:	files deleted
	8:	files changed

    For example, if Tripwire exits with status code 10, then files
were found added and changed.  (i.e., 8 + 2 = 10.)

  Tripwire quiet option:
  ======================

    When run with -q option, Tripwire really is quiet, printing only
one-line reports for each added, deleted, or changed file.  The output
is more suitable for parsing with awk or perl.

  Monotonically growing files:
  ============================

    The ">" template is now supported in the tw.config files.  This
template allows files to grow without being reported.  However, if the
file is deleted or is smaller than the size recorded in the database,
it is reported as changed.

  Loose directory checking:
  =========================

    This option was prompted by complaints that Tripwire in Integrity
Checking and Interactive mode unnecessarily complains about
directories whose nlink, ctime, mtime, or size have changed.  When
Tripwire is run with the "-loosedir" option, directories automatically
have these attributes included in their ignore-mask, thus quieting
these complaints.

    Note that this is option is not enabled by default, making normal
Tripwire behavior no different than previous releases.  However,
running with this option enabled considerably decreases "noise" in
Tripwire reports.

    (Ideally, this "loose directory checking" should be offered on
a per-file basis in the tw.config file.  However, adding another field
to the tw.config file was too extensive a change to be considered for
this release.  A later release of Tripwire may rectify this.)

  Hooks for external services:
  ============================

    Tripwire now supports the "-cfd" and "-dfd" options that allow the
user to specify an open file descriptor for reading the configuration
file and database file, respectively.  Using these options, an
external program can feed Tripwire both input files through open file
descriptors.  This external program could supply services not provided
though Tripwire, such as encryption, data compression, or a
centralized network server.

    This program might do the following:  Open the database and
configuration files, process or decode (i.e., uncompress the file),
and then write out the reguarly formatted file to a temporary file.
Open file descriptors to these files are then passed to Tripwire by
command-line arguments though execl().

    An example of using a shell script to compress and encrypt your
files is given in ./contrib/zcatcrypt.  It is a four line Bourne shell
script that encrypts and compresses the database and configuration
files.  It uses a named pipe (FIFO) to do this.

  SHA/SHS signature routines:
  ===========================

    Tripwire now includes SHA/SHS, the proposed NIST Digital Signature
Standard.  See the README file for details on this algorithm.

    Please note that the SHA code in ./sigs/sha seems to be poorly
handled by many optimizing C compilers.  For example, the stock C
compiler included with SunOS 4.x takes almost two minutes to compile
this file with the -O option on a Sparcstation10.

    Other compilers (such as GCC) do not have this problem.

  Change in tw.config preprocessor:
  =================================

    The tw.config preprocessor has been changed to allow the proper
expansion of @@variables in filenames.  The following use of @@define
now works as expected:

	@@define DOMAIN_NAME    my_main_nis_domain
	/var/yp/@@DOMAIN_NAME   L
	@@DOMAIN_NAME/FOO	L

    (This is the third attempt at getting this working correctly.  We
finally fixed this by moving the macro expansion routines into the
lexical analyzer.)

  Expanded test suite:
  ====================

    The Tripwire test suite now includes runs a more standard
signature test suite.  This was prompted by discovery of several
implementation errors in the MD2, MD4, and MD5 signature routines that
was introduced right before the official release of Tripwire.  (Thanks
Eugene Zaustinsky.)

    Two more test suites have been added.  One iterates through all
the Tripwire reporting functionalities, and exercises all the database
update cases.  The other test suite checks for proper Tripwire
preprocessor macro expansions.

  CRC32 changes:
  ==============

    Furthermore, the CRC32 signature routine is now POSIX 1003.2
compliant.  (Thanks Dan Bernstein.)

  "siggen" replaces "sigfetch":
  =============================

    As a tester noted, "sigfetch" was a misnomer as nothing was
actually being fetched.  Consequently, it was easy to (incorrectly)
conclude that "sigfetch" retrieved signatures from the database.

    The "siggen" command is the current incarnation of "sigfetch".
The manual pages reflect this change.

  Source code cleanup:
  ====================

    The authors went through the sources, doing generic cleanups aid
in code comprehension.

  Bug fixes:
  ==========

    This release fixes all known bugs.  The TODO list, however, gives a
wishlist of features that may be included in future releases.
