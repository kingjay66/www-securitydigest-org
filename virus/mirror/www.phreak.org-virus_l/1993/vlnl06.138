I have talked to a number of people who have not received their
copy of the Proceedings. I did not receive a copy, or any explanation of
why it never came. Maybe it was lost in the mail, along with the
70 vendor booths, and lunch?

I don't know if the Proceedings were ever printed. Perhaps someone
could contact the organizer for the facts.

Kevin, so far NONE of those whom I asked ever received their promissed
volume of conference papers, including myself. Minor correction: I
didNOT "announce" that this would be available but forwarded a related
message from officials.  You may not be aware that I left, under
strong protest, the IDES Program Com- mittee because there was no
evidence that this year's problems were likely to be avoided next
year; several other member also left, and both ACM and IEEE withdrew
their support for this event. I'm not aware whether the present Pro-
gram Conmmittee is still active, and whether I'll ever have a chance
to see my paper "Towards Quality Assurance of AntiVirus Products",
presented at IDES-93, ever printed in this overdue volume :-)

Subject: Opinion

Just a note of caution. Symantec/Peter Norton has introduced NAV 3.0
and their ad (inside back cover, InfoWorld Oct. 13, 1993) states:
"INTRODUCING THE ONLY ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE THAT WON'T BE OBSOLETE BY
 THE TIME YOU FINISH READING THIS AD." (their capitals, not mine).

Aside from feeling that this is insulting to my software and others,
there is something that readers should be aware of. According to what
I have been told, NAV 3.0 will not work on an IBM-PC or XT. (I have
observed this with The Norton Utilities 7.0).

Nowhere in the ad is this mentioned and if you request their FAX-back,
the only hint is on the last page under System Requirements where
following the first bullet is "IBM, AT, PS/2 and 100% compatables".
Accidental typo ?  Will it be claimed that they meant "IBM-AT, PS/2
and ...". Just be warned.

The second point is one that is a real sore point. For some time it
has been my opinion that the US Patent System is being abused,
particularly by snake-oil vendors. Now this is nothing new, the Seldon
patent threatened to hold up automotive design in the early 1900's
until Henry Ford broke it (of course Mr. Ford had rather deep
pockets).

Anyone watching the TNT movie on Alexander Graham Bell also got a
Hollywood glimpse of the patent office in action.

The Symantec ad refers to "our patent-pending Symantec NOVI Virus
Sensor Technology". Of course since the same patent-pending notice
appears on the (C) 1991 NOVI Box, it must have been "pending" for at
least two years. More to the point, since the "NOVI" technology did
not appear to be anything more than found in heuristic scanners,
integrity management tools, and checksumming systems in the past, one
must wonder what is patentable in NOVI or, like many others have done,
is there a hope that the Patent office lacks the expertise in this
rather arcane area to be able to separate prior art from what is
truely original.

In the past, several people suggested that my DiskSecure/SafeMBR
techniques were sufficiently novel to be patentable - I decided that I
would rather just get rid of viruses and return to productive work. To
me valuable ideas are to be shared, not licensed.

Now it is possible that NAV3 may prove to be much better than its
previous incarnations, certainly NOVI had some good concepts enbodying
many of the ideas discussed on Virus-L previously discussed here on
Virus-L. I hope it is since we are seeing too many trivial viruses
blowing by name products.  I just do not like the way Symantec is
marketing it.

Subject: Re:Swiss AntiViral legislation

Colleagues and friends, thanx for the very helpful and positively critical com-
ments. I append Mr. Frigerio's reply for your information. Klaus (Oct.21,1993)

PS: Mr. Frigerio will have another fight with lawyers who think that any legis-
lation is dangerous as it may also hurt the "good viruses". I argued that
"good viruses" exist only in Dr. Cohen's head, as those applications which he
always mentions can be realized by non-replicative methods. Moreover, any auto-
matic reproduction has an unwished side-effect, as copyrights for any software
does only apply to the original (=uninfected) program, so viruses "steal" also
legal rights from both the originator and the user (who looses the guarantee,
if any, of a working program :-)

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Mr. Frigerio's response <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Thanks to everybody who replied on the subject of Swiss Anti-Virus Legis-
lation.

As somebody noticed there was a word missing in the English translation. It
should have been: "... destructs electronically or similarly saved or TRANS-
MITTED data will..."

The text posted to the net, was a trial to include into the "data damaging"
even creation and dealing/circulating computer viruses. The idea behind this,
is that the virus itself already carries the malicious intent of his author.
Therefore it is dangerous in any circumstance. Actually a virus can not be
abused, as the idea of abuse includes the possibility, that a virus can be
used in a good way too. As I have been told by specialists, there is no such
"good use" of a virus as any unauthorized change of data has the potential of
interfering with other data and/or programs in environments, that the virus
author did/could not foresee. And even the unauthorized use of storage space
is a damage, as this space will not be available for authorized uses of the
computer system. Computer virus are an "absolute danger", and as any other
dangerous thing (like explosive, poison, radioactiv materials or genetic
materials in specialized labs) computer virus should not be created or
circulated without restrictions.

It has been remarked that in the text there was no word about the requisite
intent or requisite knowledge of the committer. This way any BBS sysop would
always risk criminal charges, if his BBS carries any virus infected software
but the sysop isn't aware of it.

I apologize for not having told that Swiss Penal Law only considers inten-
tional crimes, if there is no explicit indication that negligent acts are
punished too. Therefore according to Swiss Penal Law terminology and system,
the text posted to the net only considers who "knowingly and willingly"
commits the act. That means that the author of the virus has to know it was
a virus, what he created: this is always the case. And who circulates the
virus has to know it was a virus and he wanted to circulate it. The know-
ledge that SW was or carried a virus can be proved easily by the fact that
nobody knowingly stores viruses without labeling or marking them in any way,
in order not to be infected himself (yes, I know: if there really is somebody
so foolish, I have to find another way to prove his knowledge). For BBS a
"Virus Directory" containing viruses or virus source codes is evidence enough
for the "requisite knowledge and intent". The law does no want to punish
accidental distribution of viruses.

The phrase "means destined for unauthorized deletion" has been considered
unclear. "Means" certainly includes not only software, but source code (on
paper as on disks) too. It has been remarked that it's the classical tool-
maker problem: a knife can be used as woodcarver to make a great work, but
it might be used aven as a thug to commit murder.
I realized this problem, but would you consider a knife as generally
destined to commit murder? Or would you consider explosive as generally
destined to create damage? We have to be aware that most items can be used
in a legal or abused in an illegal way. Seldom an item can only be used in
an illegal way, but computer viruses are such items! I do not speak about
software using virus specific reproduction techniques (like "killer viruses"
for copyright enforcement or "anti-viruses" supposed to fight viruses) that
make data changes with the explicit (contract/license) or implicit (highly
probable agreement of the user) authorization of the user. This kind of SW
is actually not included in the definition of "means destined for unatho-
rized deletion, modification, or destruction of data".
Therefore you cannot say that Norton Utilities, WipeFile or any other
similar general purpose SW or utilities are "destined for unautorized
deletion, modification or destruction", although they certainly could be
used for this.

The text doesn't say anything about malice, malicious intents or the intent
to damage, as these elements are very difficult to prove in trial, if the
accused denies any such intention. Actually I considered these subjective
elements as not really necessary, as the virus already carries the malicious
intent of its author: the malice of the author is proved by his virus, and
the malice of somebody circulating the virus is proved, if his knowledge,
that he was circulating a virus, is proved.

According to general principles of penal law the site of crime is the main
link to charge somebody. If a virus has been created or circulated outside
the national borders of Switzerland, Swiss Penal law cannot be applied. But
if a virus created outside Switzerland is transferred electronically to
Switzerland, the downloader will be held responsible, no matter if he was
in Switzerland or abroad, as "importing" as a way to circulate the virus.
The "success" of the act will take place in Switzerland. Anyway Art. 7 of
Swiss Penal Law follows the principle of territoriality and the
"Ubiquitaetsprinzip" (sorry: didn't find the correct English word: an act
is considered being committed not only where the committer was, when he
started his crime, but also where the "success" has been realized. Anyway
I do consider clearifing this by inserting that "importing" virus is
considered as "circulating in any way".

As this crime is prosecuted as soon as police or prosecution authority knows
about it (so called "ex officio", there is no need for a specific complaint:
a detailed information about a fact is enough to start investigations, no
matter where the information came from (e.g. abroad).

There is no doubt, that professional ant-virus specialists and scientists
should have access to viruses and be allowed to even create viruses. As
long as this is covered by the aim of studying strategies to fight
computer viruses, this is OK. I actually planned a system of registrering
these people with a federal authority (e.g. the IS Security Dptm. at the
Swiss Federal Office of Information Technology and Systems or the Ministery
of Justice). The posted text would be then need to be completed as follows:
"Who, without being registered with the proper federal authority, creates...
Only trustworthy individuals, who are professionally or scientifically
active in combatting such means, may be registered on demand."

The Swiss legislator is actually not only considering "data damaging" but
"hacking", "time theft" and computer fraud too, but these ARE NOT subjects
of the discussion in this forum now. The same applies to software piracy,
already ruled by another law. I will gladly email/fax the German, French or
Italian text of the Penal Law draft to anybody interested. Please do not
ask me an English translation of these, as I am not a professional English
translator of legal text.

I am aware that the UK and Italy have/are going to have laws allowing to
prosecute the creation and circulation of computer viruses. If anybody
knows of other contries, may he please let me know in any way and as soon
as possible.

On Monday, 25 October 1993, there will a meeting with the Ministery of
Justice in order to convince them to propose this to the Parliament. This
will be very very difficult, as there generally is very little knowledge
on, or concern for the threat through computer viruses. Most people have
simply never suffered an attack of computer viruses.

Thanks again for following this item with your comments.

to make them more aware of the risks...

Doesn't a secure file system greatly limits the potential for spead of
viruses?  An infected program would have to be executed by root to
spead the infection to most of the system software.

 I appologize if this is a FAQ.  I have a friend who is installing a

 He wants to know the best way to protect his network from viruses.

 He is interested in protecting the SERVER but also the individual
 workstations.  He is running Novell v. 3.11.  What's the best

I was wondering, what types of viruses can infect a Novell 1.x network
and can they infect from a terminal with no rights to executable

viruses (hopefully) fail to work on these outdated computers? Thanx in

Subject: Beta test for Integrity Checker/Recovery Utility. (PC)

Hello,

Anyone interested in beta-testing of product, described below is
welcome to reply. I worked a lot in a software development/virus
protection field.  As a programmer I converted some of my ideas into
this product.  Program was written a big while ago and still "in the
deep woods" of my desk.

I named it "The Global Shield".  The product is dedicated to the
protection of computers against unknown and future viruses. There is
no mystery here.  The program is basically full-scale integrity
checker with powerful recovery capabilities.  Program saves tiny
pieces of information about file(s)/bootable areas of a selected
drives. This information could be used later to completely recover
file(s) after possible future infection. At home I calculated success
rate of it as 95%. The algorithms of recovery is smarter, than cutting
the infected tail of file and restore first 3 bytes. More complicated
cases of infection are handled as well.  Other features: it could find
the source of infection occured, without any information saved before
and use it later.  It has also features of recognizing presence of
unknown viruses in bootable areas (Partition/Boot sector) and
recover/reconstruct these areas.  I included cure against some known
viruses in it, but that was done mostly for fun and does not related
to the general idea of product.

Program is quite friendly and menu-based. It is a DOS application. The
speed of file processing could be slower, than some virus utilities,
because it "learn" much more information about each file, than regular
"signature" scanner.

March 15, 1993 1000 PST                                       Number D-10
__________________________________________________________________________
NAME:        November 17 virus
ALIASES:     NOV 17, 855
PLATFORM:    MS DOS Computers
DAMAGE:      On November 17 will destroy hard disk contents
SYMPTOMS:    Files grow by 855, 768, 880, or 800 bytes
DETECTION/
ERADICATION: FPROT 207, Scan V102, Novi
__________________________________________________________________________
              Critical Facts about the November 17 virus

The November 17 virus is a simplistic file infector virus which has
recently been discovered to be fairly widespread.  This virus will
overwrite the hard disk on November 17 of any year.

Infection Mechanism

This virus is a file infector virus (see CIAC bulletins A-20, A-27,
A-29, B-35, and 3 bulletins from Fiscal Year 1989 for information on
similar file infector viruses).  Upon execution of a virus-infected
program, NOV 17 will become memory resident at the top of memory and
inhabit 896 bytes of memory.

Once resident, it will infect any .COM and .EXE programs when the file
attributes are set or read, when the file is opened for READ, and upon
loading and execution.  Therefore, if the virus is resident in memory,
and a new disk with clean executibles is copied, the original disk's
EXE and .COM files will become infected if the disk is not
write-protected.  It can easily be transferred via LAN's anytime an
executible file is opened or executed over the LAN.  This virus will
not infect files with a filename of SCAN.EXE or CLEAN.EXE, and it will
not infect files that have the system bit set.  It does not affect
data files.

Potential Damage

On November 17 of any year this virus will overwrite portions of the
C: drive or current drive, depending on the variant.  On any other day
of the year this virus will simply replicate.  Some variants will
cause this overwrite process to occur on days after November 17.

Detection and Eradication

Many recent versions of antivirus products will detect this virus.
Another method of direct detection is to search for the string
"SCAN.CLEAN.COMEXE", which can be found within the virus code of every
infection.

Until March of 1993, there had been no reports of this virus in the
United States.  Because of this fact, some anti-virus products do not
detect the presence of it by name.  Some products, such as Data
Physician Plus!, do detect when it they themselves become infected, at
which point a message such as "A virus has been detected, would you
like to continue?" may appear on the screen.  This message means that
the antivirus product's self check mechanism has detected a
modification to itself, and at this point CIAC recommends that you
check the machine with a different antivirus product, or call CIAC for
additional information on virus handling.

Virus Variants

There are four known variants to this virus, all increase file lengths
by a different amount and take up a different amount of resident
memory.  The variants increase file lengths of infected files by 768,
800, 880, and 855 bytes.  The 768 variant is almost identical to the
original virus but takes up 800 bytes of memory; it was discovered in
May of 1992. The variant which adds 800 bytes to files takes up 832
bytes of memory, was discovered in March of 1993, and activates
November 17-30 of any year.  The 880 variant, which uses 928 bytes of
memory, first seen in November, 1992, will activate on any date from
November 17-December 31 of any year.  The 855 variant, also called
Nov17B, first seen in September of 1992, causes infected .EXE files to
hang the system when executed.

Due to the nature of this virus's infection mechanism, it is sometimes
not possible to remove the infection from a host program.  CIAC
recommends that if this virus is discovered a copy be kept and then
all infected files be deleted and restored from backup.

Who has had some expereince with "Inader"-virus?

I have the following questions:

1. Is the MacAffee virus scanner abel to find it?
2. Can the virus be "cleaned" from an infected disk?
3. Is it an stealth virus?

Is it possible to poll the write-protect soft-switch?  If it is possible
to poll this location without turning the drive on, then you can have
an interrupt-driven program watch to see if the write protect status
changes.  This would indicate a disk removal/insertion.

Subject: Possible new virus?? MAZE?! (PC)

We have found a new MSDOS file infector virus.  I would appreciate any
information about this virus or help that you can offer.

The virus adds between 985 and 988 bytes to the file size of the
affected file and datestamps the file when the infection occurs.
Infection occurs when a COM or EXE is executed on a computer that has
the virus in memory.  On the machine I examined COMMAND.COM is
infected so the virus is brought into memory immediately upon startup.
The AUTOEXEC.BAT file has been corrupted and although the file size is
still the same as the original batch file the first 26 bytes have
changed to "MAZE Written by K.stanbs" and the rest of the file filled
out with garbage. (it would seem) The AUTOEXEC.BAT was not being
loaded at all, and DOS simply requested the date and time.  After
working with the machine for a period of time the CONFIG.SYS also
became corrupt in the same way.  This file, however, is being read by
DOS, as the messages "Unrecognised command in CONFIG.SYS" are being
displayed at startup.  I notice the hard drive's volume label is STAN
(similar to K.stanbs).  I don't know if this is a coincidence.

Neither McAfee SCAN 108 or Virus Buster 3.97.01 can identify this
virus.  I have uploaded samples to the BBS's of both of these
products.

Any help anyone on the list can provide is appreciated!

Hello there,

     I'm in the unlucky situation of POSSIBLY having a virus on my
computer...  Because of its symptoms (affecting high memory etc) I
can't run Windows thus use Word to type my Report etc....

    I was wandering if any of you guys out there in computer world
would have any virus signatures for the Dudley virus???

    Because this virus was caught recently on the net there are no
scanners for it avail. so I'll do the more monotonous task of
searching signatures (usually works for me....)

    I hope one of those sorts who likes gathering virus signatures for
there own scanners might be reading this and can help..

                                    Thanks in advance....

I'd contact with the TREMOR - Virus two months ago.
He had destroid the win.com file and some other system - files from Windows 3.1
I'd checkd the Harddisk with the last Version of the f-prot Virus-checked, I
think it was Version 2.08 or 2.09. He recocnized the Tremor-Virus. After
an examination of the infected files, I'd found an self-hiding routine which
makes the Tremor - Virus able to create nearly 15 millions variations of
himself.
Some of these variations might be able to make the hardrive C: write protected

Wish you the best

The self-hiding routine from the Tremor Virus is able to hide himself
in nearly 15 million variation. Some of these are able to destroy the
system files from windows 3.1.  Another variation makes the harddrive
c: write protected.  Funny, isn't it.

I recently encountered a virus that Norton NAVSCAN identified as
MtE. Unfortunately, Norton didn't provide a description of the virus;
it basically told me to delete it and reinstall the file. Neither
the versions of Central Point CPAV, MacAffee, or PC Virus that I
have even recognize this virus. Does anyone know what this MtE virus
does, and if there's a way to remove it without re-installing the
infected files?

Hi fellows.

Announcing a new program from A. Padgett Peterson, ETHCRD.ZIP, now
available for FTP on our site.  Following is an excerpt of ETHCRD.ASC:

                          ETHCRD.COM v1.2 October, 1993

                           FreeWare by Padgett (C)1993

        The Program is designed to detect if there is an ethernet card and
        driver present, determine if the driver is TCP/IP or IPX,   report
        the driver information, then extract the hardware address  of  the
        card, return this address, and then determine and return  the card
        manufacturer information.

        The program has been structured so that the hardware address,  if
        found,  will always be on the third line following the  logo.  If
        via  a packet driver, the first line after the logo will  contain
        driver  and interrupt number information, if via IPX  the  second
        line will be filled in.
