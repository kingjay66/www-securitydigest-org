Compared to many (or most?) other viruses, it is well written, yes, but that
is simply because most virus code is junk that looks like it was made by a
not-so-talented thirteen year old...

When the Dark Avenger virus (which one, by the way...there are around or over
30 variants of the original virus) was originally released it was considered
quite advanced - but it does not use the most "advanced" methods that
are known today.

The programmer is however quite talented...what a shame that he decided to
waste his energy in writing viruses.

(A reader writes about switching A & B drives & winding up with unusable
 3 1/2" floppies)

That is right - the Michalangelo assumes that everything that is not a
360k floppy is a 1.2 Mb 5 1/4. It also only affects floppies in your A
drive hence the problem with 3 1/2s after you switched the drives.

To fix, remove the virus from the PC (FDISK/MBR will work if you boot from
a clean floppy). My FreeWare FixFBR (in the FixUtil - 5 is current 6
will be out shortly) will fix the corrupted 3 1/2s, just tell it what
kind of disks they really are.

Normally this does not occur since Mich usually does not infect a PC with a
3 1/2 A drive but since you swapped the drives after infection...

Does it not find it or does it not properly identify it? Some weeks
ago, we found what F-Prot 2.09 called "new variant of Stoned" on one
of our PCs. I forwarded a copy to Frisk, but then I got curious and
tried several other scanners available on the net, *all* of which
identified this virus as Monkey (B), while F-Prot 2.09d still calls it
a Stoned variant.

Get KILLMNK2.ZIP, which includes a description of both Monkey variants.
If you need to get rid of it immediately, you can either use a disk
repair utility like NDD or DISKFIX, or replace the MBR with a clean
backup. We didn't try KILLMONK.EXE, but it should do the job as well.
Do *not* use FDISK /MBR or you'll trash your drive.

Sorry, but you are wrong...totally wrong.  There are boot sector viruses
that will infect boot sectors of logical drives on the hard disk, but
Stoned is not one of them.

>As soon as you access the drive (in this case, probably drive
>D:), it will be infected.

Just look at the Stoned virus -  Stoned.Standard.A, to be exact.  It contains
two code fragments that write the virus code to disk.

Around offset 008B you see code that infects the A: drive.  It will not touch
B: or any of the logical drives on the hard disk...only drive 0.

Then, around offset 017E is the code to infect the hard disk.  It will only
touch the first hard disk (0080) in any system, and it overwrites head 0,
track 0, sector 1 - the MBR, not the logical boot sectors.

Please check your facts before making claims about what a particular virus
does or doesn't do.

Read the warning in the CPAV manual - they basically admit their product is
not compatible with other anti-virus packages.   I just made one minor
change to F-PROT - it will check for the CPAV TSR in memory, and skip the
memory scan, and just display a warning message if it is found ....I am

F-PROT always refuses to remove viruses that are different from those it
recognizes.  If Stoned changes by as little as one bit, I consider it a
new variant, which is probably what happened in your case.

Not unless you (or somebody else) sends me a copy of this virus - to provide
disinfection I need identification.

The machine does not have to "support" MBR ... all that matters is that you
boot from a DOS 5 or DOS 6 disk and use that.

No, the MBR is just reconstructed from scratch...the code part is overwritten
with generic code (which may not be identical to the original code, although
it is *functionally* identical), and the data part is created by searching
the fisk for valid partitions.

Yes, I wish so to :-)

No, probably the virus just overwrote the part at the beginning of the
boot sector that stores information about stuff like how many sides the disk
has etc...if that gets corrupted, the diskette may not be readable by DOS.

did you actually compare the FATs, or did you just see that the directory

There are several viruses that have this effect (although it is not
intentional, just a side-effect of bad coding) but the only widespread one
is Azusa.

Just remember to boot from a clean diskette before scanning your hard disk.

You need to gibve more information when posting messages like this, in
particular which scanner identifies that virus.  "Phoenix 3" is not a
standard CARO name, so it is very difficult to answer the question.

1) The virus is a "stealth" virus, so when you boot from a clean disk the MBR
contains the virus code...when booting from an infected one, the virus
intercepts the read, and returns the original MBR.

The virus code does not contain the valid partition data at the end, so when
you just "see" the virus code, no partitions appear to exist.

> And what is the best way to proceed?

Well, if this was a known virus, F-PROT should be able to deal with this,
but in your case the following should do the trick - you need NU and NDD..
I use version 4.5, but later versions should work...I just hate that
user-interface.

   0) know what you are doing
   1) boot from a clean diskette
   2) run NU
   3) select (in absolute sector mode) head 0, track 0, sector 1 of the
      first hard disk (ther MBR) you might want to save a copy of it to
      a file).
   4) wipe it out - fill it (or at least the table at the end) with 0 bytes.
   5) exit NU, and run NDD.  NDD will say the MBR has been corrupted and
      offer to reconstruct it.  Say yes.
   6) reboot
   7) smile

ah, by the way...you might need to use "maintenance mode"...don't remember
exactly...it's quite a while since I had to do this..

Yes, Mich was your problem.  Both Mich and his brother, Stoned, are
unable to infect 3.5 High Density disks without corrupting them.

When Stoned was written, there was no such thing as a 3.5 HD diskette.
The differences in sector usage were therefore not, either.  The mich is
a Stoned hack.

On Fri, 01 Oct 93 09:30:38 CDT, Ted E <Davis@UMR-MAEM-PO1> kindly pointed
out to me, in private mail, that the above DIR commands work only with
DOS-formatted partitions. As Stoned is an MBR infector, it can also
infect hard disks containing non-DOS partitions. For those, I'll append
a suitably amended generic procedure. If you are dealing with a standard
variety of the Stoned virus, you can also use a good dis-infector, such
as F-PROT 2.09 (or up), to remove it from both hard and floppy disks.

To prevent re-infection, you can use the BIOS setup menu many computers
provide to revert the boot sequence from "A,C" to "C,A" (cf. step 1,
below). This will interrupt the standard infection path, but there are
also Stoned-droppers known (droppers circumvent this sort of protection).

Generic Procedure for Removing a Benign MBR Virus from a Hard Disk

1. Switch off the computer for at least 90 seconds, then boot from a
   clean, write protected disk with the system you have used to format
   the first partition of the hard disk. ((Footnote: If the computer
   still boots from the hard disk, switch off again, wait, then switch on
   and follow the instructions on the screen to enter the BIOS Setup
   menu and set the "Boot Sequence" from "C,A" to "A,C")) Refuse any
   offer to install the system on the hard disk. Manually enter any
   commands to establish a sensible environment (such as KEYB, and
   PROMPT commands under DOS); be sure not to invoke any programs from
   the hard disk, nor to establish any path for automatic invocation
   thereof.

   Ask for a list of all files on this partition (in DOS, you enter the
   command "DIR C:" to do so). Only if the partition table (which is part
   of the MBR) is undisturbed, and if the partition were formatted by a
   system that is compatible with the system you booted from, the
   contents of the partition will be correctly reflected.

   Repeat for all partitions, booting with various operating systems,
   as necessary.

2. Boot from a clean, write protected DOS-5.0-disk (if not already
   done so for the last partition, in step 1). Procede as described
   above; when a suitable environment is established, enter the command
   FDISK /STATUS

   This FDISK command will report the contents of the partition table.

3. Only if access to all partitions has been found undisturbed in steps 1
   and 2, enter the command
   FDISK /MBR

   This FDISK command will replace the code part of the MBR on the hard
   disk, leaving the partition table in place.

   Beware: some MBR viruses move the partition table elsewhere, then
   replace the entire MBR. When you apply the "FDISK /MBR" command to
   a hard disk modified in this way, you will loose the partition
   table and in due course the access to the data on the disk. Hence the
   essential steps 1 and 2, above, to make sure the partition table is
   valid and in place.

4. Run your favourite virus scanner from the floppy disk to check the
   hard disk (just to make sure).

5. Switch off the computer, then boot from the hard disk.

This procedure uses only the hardware of the computer and the software
you provide on floppy disks; hence it will work regardless of the
operating system you are normally using.

Forget it. The Stoned virus DOES NOT infect boot sectors of logical
drives - it infects only hard disk's MBR (primary partition table) and
boot sectors of floppies A: and B: .

Well, you are talking about boot sectors of logical drives and at the
same time refer to FDISK/MBR, which handles MBR only (NOT DOS

It all looks like false positives to me, made worse by the age-old
interaction between CPAV and anything else.

Dump CPAV and scan with a current version of F-Prot. The CPAV with MS-DOG
is out of date before you get it, and (aside from its' other shortcomings)
can't be trusted.

Also, try scanning your hard drive from the windows/dos prompt and see
if the error is still generated. This is probably an interaction between
your scanner and the VIS tsr.

>2)F-PROT tsr loaded as device driver, VIS tsr loaded as above, CPAV
>tsr loaded in autoexec.bat with option /2+.

No, pick one and only one to load at a time. Especially don't ever
load CPAV with anything else (or better yet, not at all), as it
doesn't clean up after itself. We use F-Prot here, with excellent
results.

Yeah, CPAV left its' scan strings laying around again....

Right. No CPAV leavings, no errors.

Don't use more than one antiviri tsr at a time. Go with whichever
one you think is most up-to-date or has the best library (once more,
we use F-Prot under a service license). In reality, the majority
of infections come from old viri, like Stoned and Jerusalem, so just
having a tsr in place protects you against most of the hazards you
face.

But dump CPAV anyway; Microsoft did nobody a favor when they picked
that package to distribute.

When F-Prot is in heuristic mode it scans for known viruses as well.
=> A known virus is detected by the standard scan engine before
   heuristics come into play.
=> Your 'virus' is *not* detected by heuristics.

BTW it seems that you've got a false positive that is fixed with
later versions of F-Prot.

Ciao,
Gerald

PS: Please Frisk, provide (or document :-) ) a way to use heuristics
    only! (Or have I missed something in the docs?)
    I used to test heuristic mode by letting it examine files I knew to
    be infected by a known virus.

We received some new computers from a dealer (with whom we are *very*
displeased) and they arrived infected with what we later discovered
was Michelangelo.  These machines had Microsoft DOS 6.0 loaded on
them, but repeated scans using the Microsoft Anti Virus software did
not detect the virus.  The immediate symptom was the failure in all
cases of the 3.5" B drive and in some cases the 5.25" A drive.  All
disks inserted in the B drive had the boot sector corrupted.  Norton
Disk Doctor was frequently able to restore these disks.  Finally, a
consultant brought in McAfee and discovered the virus for us (how
embarassing!).  A clean up, FDISK /MBR, and imposition of strict rules
on the use of floppy disks seem to have cleared the problem and
rendered the computers useful.

You need to transfer these files as binary.  That may be your problem.
I forget to do that sometimes and get a similar message.

We received some computers with this virus kindly installed by the dealer
(some of the devices got Michelangelo instead). I sent a message to Frisk
since I couldn't get his sw to disinfect and he kindly explained that it
would not since it was a new variant. I sent him the disk so hopefully he
will have a copy of whatever we had.  McAfee identified the virus as
"Stamford". Microsoft Anti Virus (DOS 6.0) didn't identify the virus at
all.

Can ordinary user distinguish boot virus from multipartite one?

Maybe it was infected by multipartite virus which infects boot/mbr but
doesn't found 'good' file for infection up to now?

It hooks int 01, 15h, 21h and writes itself at the end of COM and EXE files.
Sometimes it "shakes" the screen or displays the message
"TREMOR was done by " etc.

Yes. If High Mem is not available, it stays TSR as ordinary virus.

> I'm searching for information about the  Commander Bomber Virus.

Try to find VirusBulletin December'92, page 10.

A brief info:

It's a harmless memory resident polymorphic virus. It hooks int 21h
and infects COM-file except COMMAND.COM on their execution. It contains the
internal text messages "COMMANDER BOMBER WAS HERE" and "[DAME]".

The characteristic feature of this infector consist of new polymorphic
algorithm. Upon infection the virus reads 4096 bytes from the random
selected offset and writes this code at the and of the file. Then it writes
its code into this 'hole' and starts to polymorphism. This virus
contains several subroutines which generate random (but
successfully executed!) code, the virus inserts those parts of random code
into the random chosen position into the host file. There are about 90% of
all the i8086 instructions are present into those parts. The part of code
takes the control from the previous part by JMP, CALL, RET, RET xxxx
instructions. The first part is inserted into the file beginning and jumps
to next part, the next part jumps the third etc. The last part returns
control to the main virus body. At the end the infected file looks like at
'spots' of inserted code.
