What you want is not a virus - all you need is something that is run in
a login script, and checks the user's hard disk when he logs into the
network.

Sure, this *could* be done with a virus, but that would be an *EXTREMELY
STUPID* thing to do, and would probably cost you your job.

Problem #1:  Preventing the virus from "escaping" - you don't want the virus
             spreading over the whole country, do you ?

Problem #2:  Self-checking programs & Integrity checkers would notice the
             virus, and raise an alarm - have you considered the support
             that would require.

Problem #3:  Unknown side-effects - what if there is a bug in the virus, and
             it corrupts something when a certain combination of other
             programs is in use ?

Problem #4:  Do you seriously think I (and other anti-virus producers) would
             ignore your virus just because it was supposed to be
             "non-malicious" ?

I could co on, but the conclusion is obvious...trying to solve the problem
with a virus-type program is pretty idiotic.

Subject: Problems with FPROT ?? (PC)

      Actually, VIRSTOP - not FPROT.  I had a run-in with Michelangelo
   recently that was appearing on machines that were set up to check for
   viruses on reboot (/DISK /FREEZE /WARM /BOOT /COPY) and we ran a few
   tests to see what we could do about it.  VIRSTOP does not (??) appear
   to do memory-testing for viruses already loaded?  We set up FPROT to
   load and scan the machine (using cmd line parms) and it can be set to
   scan memory -or- to auto-disinfect the disk.

      FPROT's auto-disinfect is nice, but that's only available if you
   do *not* scan the memory and it leaves the active virus in memory.
   The memory scan is nice, but it appears to detect a virus and continue
   through without locking the machine (if in cmd-line mode).

      Curiously enough, the configuration we toyed with that _did_ work
   as expected (locking on reboot if the diskette was infected) was a
   combination of VIRSTOP *and* VSHIELD.  It seems that VSHIELD's action
   to check the disk triggers VIRSTOP's /COPY (or one of the other parms)
   to detect a virus on the diskette - hanging the machine with a message
   to this effect.

      Anyone planning a package with the future detection abilities of the
   VIRSTOP /COPY and the bulldog attributes of VSHIELD's virus-in-memory
   detection?  I would definitely be interested.

The Trident virus I believe is not actually a virus, it is the Trident
Polymorphic Engine, akin to the Mutation Engine, which encrypts a virus
differently every time a new file is infected. Since any number of virii
may use the Engine, it is impossible to say what the virus would have done

If you're going to rely on Scanners, I recommend the following.

F-Prot
Integrity Master
Thunderbyte
Scan
VIRx

All five scanners are Share Ware or Free Ware.

If you want to go beyond scanning, look for Generic virus detection.

I have tested all of these on my test machine with live viruses in memory,
and all of these work as advertized.

  F-Prot Professional
* Integrity Master
  PC-cillin
  PC-Rx
* Thunderbyte Anti-Virus
  Untouchable
* Victor Charlie

* denotes Share Ware product.

I test A-V software monthly, and will be releasing the LAT report in about
a week.

Hope it is of use to you.

You must be reading an old VSUM - the latest VSUM states that DSAVTK, F-PROT
Scan, Virus Buster and VirusNet can detect it - I guess VET and several other
products that VSUM does not cover can detect it too....

Never trust anything VSUM says about removal of viruses - that is usually the
most incorrect part of the description.

Trigger Virus

Trigger infects .COM and .EXE files from 2 bytes - 29696 bytes. My largest
bait file is 29K 29696 bytes.

Trigger has the following text in the first generation (Trigger by Dark
Angel of Phalcon/Skism  Utilising Dark Angel's Multiple Encryptor (DAME)).
No text is readable in the second generation and beyond.

Trigger is polymorphic, but not stealth. On my test machine, the files
grew by 2493 bytes - 2653 bytes

Trigger appends the virus to the end of the host files.

This is the way windows works, what you see is the swapping it does with the
disk.
If you use SMARTDRV also you might even experiance writes and reads to the
disk at IDLE time (when apperantly nothing is running on your system) these
are the delyed disk access done by the CACHE.

Typical Root-Directory destruction. Cause: can be a virus (DIR-2 sometimes
causes it, but then one should expect the have som indication on one's hard
disk, run CHKDSK on your disk to see), another cause might be a fault in some
program, or a hardware fault.

If you nkow what you are doing you might regain access to the floppy by using
the combination of CHKDSK, NDD and DISKEDIT. If you are not familiar with the
reconstructing methods, don't start, as it might turn out to be very
frustrating!

How about me?

 > I would like to know if there is a cure for it, and if so,
Yes, most Anti Viruses of today...
however there is a way to clean it without one by:

0. Make sure you have a CLEAN DOS DISKETTE available !
1. Boot from the infected disk.
2. while the virus is running in memory do in EACH directory:
     REN *.COM *.CVC
     REN *.EXE *.EVC
3. Boot the PC from the floppy and do (again in EVERY directory):
     REN *.CVC *.COM
     REN *.EVC *.EXE
4. Boot again. The PC should be clean!
5. Run CHKDSK to verify: if you have a lot of
   "is crosslinked into cluter..." on your screen then the    process failed.
if you have only few... erase these files or    let CHKDSK correct (actually
destroy) the files and then    delete them!

Step 2 may be replaced with the commands
   ATTRIB +s *.COM
   ATTRIB +s *.EXE
In such case a clean DOS floppy is not necessary.

Subject: HELP!! more informations to russian virus (PC)

Hello!

There are some new infos I can give to our dubious russian virus:

We are using DOS 5.00. The COMMAND.COM on the infected PC is
50244 Bytes, original it's 50031 Byte. The date is a little bit
different to. (Sorry, I forgot to write it down, and now the PC
is already locked for today)

Scanning with F-PROT 209 gives following result:
    Scanning MBR of hard disk 1
    Master Boot Sector: Possibly a new version of Shifter

If possible, we want to avoid to formatt our harddisk. Because there are
very many things installed at.
If possible, we would like to find the virus, clear the .COM and .EXE
files, and the formatt the hard disk to get free of the virus at the
Boot Sector.
Or is their another possibility to get free of the virus in the boot
sector?

Perhaps somebody can make more conclusions from this than me??
Any help is welcome!!

Thanx and regards, Astrid Kuhr

Hi,

     Is it possible for any of the popular PC scanners to use a MAC .def
file to scan a Netware Volume with MAC namespace loaded?  ...Also vice-versa.
e.g., have F-Prot load additional definitions from SAM or Disinfectant and
scan the MAC volumes... have SAM load an F-Prot .def file and scan PC files
on the server.

     Is there or should there be a standard for virus definition files?

Subject: Perry and CPAV 2.0 (PC)

I have been receiving reports from concerned users, that the
VALIDATE.COM program that is distributed by Patricia Hoffman as a part
of the VSUM package might be infected with the Perry virus.

It seems that version 2.0 of the Central Point Anti-Virus claims this is
the case.

This is not a typical false alarm, however - the VALIDATE.COM program *does*
indeed contain the Perry code, but it is not infected at all, as Perry is
NOT A VIRUS.

Perry is (or rather was) a somewhat useless program, distributed by InterPath.
It was used to "protect" programs, so that they would either ask for a password
when run, or self-destruct on a specific date.

In this particular case, the VALIDATE.COM program is set to self-destruct
on June 6th, 2000.  (Note that this is a different version of VALIDATE than
the one currently distributed with McAfee's SCAN).

Apart from this, the Perry code is quite harmless, and the general consensus
among anti-virus manufacturers has been that there is no real need to detect
Perry-ized files as such.

Central Point, however calls Perry-ized files "infected with the Perry virus"
(which is nonsense, as the code does not replicate, and therefore is not a
virus, and even confirms this on the phone when called "Yes, Perry is a virus,
but it does not spread very much - you should just delete the file" was the
reply they gave, even though CPAV has been made aware of the problem some
time ago.

This posting is intended to set the matter straight - CPAV is calling a
clean program virus-infected.

      It's not entirely impossible that I'm messing up the configs
   somewhere ... this is related to machine(s) in an open environment
   where you can't expect users to respond appropriately ...

      VIRSTOP *shouldn't* peacefully co-exist with Michelangelo, should
   it?  I get Stoned and/or Michelangelo-A loaded before VIRSTOP (that's
   the nature of those beasts, no?) and at best VIRSTOP whispers the
   data equivalent of "I'll get you next time, Red Baron!!" as it does
   not hang/freeze/crash the machine until the virus actually infects a
   diskette (oh - using the /FREEZE /COPY params with VIRSTOP).

      We've had pleasant results with VSHIELD _and_ VIRSTOP on the same
   machine - Vstop to nail future problems with /COPY and Vshield to
   halt the machine if anything is already present.  I dunno how long I
   want to use that configuration - we're in the process of waiting for
   purchasing (the corporate equivalent of "the check is in the mail")

We have had a lot of trouble here at Academic Computing with the [MON]

particular virus?

I know Clean106 and Scan106 work fairly wellto detect and erase it. What I

purchased a license from frisk@complex.is for the f-prot program but as far
as I can tell version 2.0.9 still does not have the capability to erase the
virus from the partition table.

Does anyone know of other good effective ways of ersing this virus.  Repeated
e-mailings to the author of f-prot (even sent him a disk with the [mon] virus
on it )  have produced no feedback.  So we may have to switch to something
else after we evaluate several products.

Having dealt with some non-viral terminology, let us cover some
viral related terms that may be unfamiliar.

Most people think of viral programs in terms of Fred Cohen's
definition.  That is, a virus is a program which always
"attaches" to another program.  This has given rise to a great
many misconceptions about some of the most common viral
programs, boot sector infectors.

Boot sector infecting viral programs, often referred to as
"BSI"s, *do*, in a sense, attach to another program.  Most
people are unaware of the fact that there is a "program" on
every disk, even those which are "blank".  Every formatted disk
has a "boot sector", specified, not by a filename, but simply by
its location as the first physical (or logical, in the case of
hard drives) sector.  When the computer is "booted", the ROM
programming looks for a disk, then "runs" whatever happens to be
in that sector as a program.

In most cases, with non-bootable disks, the "program" that is
there simply prints a message reminding the user that the disk
is non-bootable.  The important thing, however, is that
regardless of how small the actual program may be, the computer
"expects" there to be a program in the boot sector, and will run
anything that happens to be there.  Therefore, any viral program
that places itself in that "boot sector" position on the disk
will be the first thing to run, other than ROM programming, when
the computer starts up.  BSIs will copy themselves onto floppy
disks, and transfer to a new computer when the "target" machine
is (usually inadvertantly) booted with an infected floppy in the
A: drive.

The physical "first sector" on a hard drive is not the boot
sector.  On a hard drive the boot sector is the first "logical"
sector.  The number one position on a hard drive is the master
boot record or MBR.  (This name gets slightly confused by the
fact that the MBR contains the partition table; the data
specifying the type of hard disk and the partitioning
information.  "Master boot record", "partition table" and
"partition boot record" are often used interchangeably, although
they are not identical entities.)  Some viral programs, such as
the Stoned virus, always attack the physical first sector: the
boot sector on floppy disks and the master boot record on hard
disks.  Thus viri that always attack the boot sector might be
termed "pure" BSIs, whereas programs like stoned might be
referred to as an "MBR type" of BSI.
