There were quite a few people posting on alt.folklore.computers about how
many silly errors like that there were. I'd be interested in seeing people
post their gripes about the article, so that I coulds summarize everything
and write a letter to TIME's editor...

Hogwash!  Granted scanners cannot detect the "new" virus till it has
infected someone, but the one thing they will do for you (if you
will only let them) is detect 99.9% of the viruses you will actually
meet before they ever get a chance to do anything to your system.

Not using a scanner because it can't detect ALL viruses is like
saying "I won't bother to lock my front door; any burglar worth his
salt can get in anyway!"

AND they can't detect a virus till it has changed something; and

Subject: Definitions of Viruses etc.

Years ago I started to study philosophy.  But I quickly discovered
that they spent inordinate amounts of time arguing about whether or
not you could prove anything.  It was obvious that I could not prove
that I was really living, and not just dreaming, and this left
me with three alternatives:

  1. I could go to bed and stay there, till the dream ended.

  2. I could spend my life agonising about whether or not I
     really existed, or

  3. I could forget the whole stupid argument and get on with making
     the most of what, if it was a dream, was a remarkably long
     running and consistent one.

I am disappointed to find that far too much of our time has recently
been wasted on Virus-L on similarly arid arguments about what is a
virus.  We used to think that the rules of trigonometry were
fundamental laws, imposed from above, but mathematicians have lately
come to realise that are just rules that we have chosen for our own
convenience.  Similarly there is no God given classification of
artificial life forms (or real ones either, for that matter), and
every rule will leave us with uncomfortably arbitrary decisions at
the boundaries.

I think most of us would be reasonably happy with the following
definitions;

 1.  A Trojan Horse is a program which purports to do something
     useful, but is in reality destructive.

 2.  A Worm is a self contained program which can spread by
     itself from computer to computer in a network.

 3.  A virus is a program which cannot exist independantly, but wich
     can attach itself to (or infect) other programs, in such a way
     that when the original program is run the virus is activated,
     and enabled to infect other programs.

Clearly viruses can be subdivided according to the type of files
infected, the way in which this is done, and so on, but I believe
these are good working definitions.  But, as I said, there will
always be difficult cases at the edges of any rule.

It is often easy to prove that a file is infected with a virus.  If
you run a program, and another program grows in length, or each
program you run afterwards becomes longer, and you can show that the
extra code occurs in the first program then it cleary incorporates a
virus.

But if someone brings you a copy of some large application program,
and says "XXX Scanner says this has YYY virus", or "I downloaded
this, and since then Windows has been crashing regularly"  you
will probably fairly quickly be able to say "I am reasonably
confident this program does not contain a virus", but it is almost
impossible to say categorically "No it does not have a virus".

When it comes to Trojan horses the situation is even worse.  For
most programs of any complexity it would be virtually impossible to
prove that a program did not contain a trojan horse, even if you had
a well commented copy of the original source code.

This is also where our definitions start to get rubbery.  It is well
known that most applications have bugs in them which will cause them
to destroy data in some circumstances.  Does this mean they are
Trojan horses?

And think about a Basic interpreter.  You can undoubtedly persuade
it to overwrite the hard disk, or erase all the files.  So is it a
Trojan horse?  I am fairly sure that if you got cunning enough you
could persuade it to attach itself to another program, and for this
copy to transfer itself to other programs each time it was run.

So is Basic also a virus?  If so maybe it is one of Freds beneficial
viruses; after all it could give you access to Basic at a keystroke,
without any tedious messing with AUTOEXEC.BAT, or having to pay
someone exhorbitant amounts of money.  And if you were lucky enough
to become infected with the Basic virus, and made use of it, would
you be infringing the authors copyright?

However one thing which is quite clear is that Xcopy, Format, etc,
are not viruses.  They may fit Freds original definition, but they
certainly do not fit the currently accepted definitions.  Fred may
not like this, anymore that the first person to use the term
"personal computer" may have liked what IBM did to his idea, but it
is mischievous for him to waste our time with his endless arguments.

Fred, I suspect, is well aware of this, but it suits his purposes to
be able to talk about his "beneficial viruses" (which no-one else
would class as viruses) because of the publicity it generates.

Unfortunately it also provides the schoolboy wannabe virus writers
with the perfect justification for their endeavors; "If Dr. Fred
Cohen says that you can have good viruses why shouldn't we try to
write one."

Two years ago I had a strange case of Cascade infection on a 386. An
APP-File of Ventura Publisher had been mistakenly hit by 1704-B and
was damaged - but not infected, since the virus in the file was no
longer capable of replicating - Ventura always crashed at startup.
Nevertheless SCAN (dunno which version it was those days :-) ) flagged
it as infected when using the /A switch; and there were other,
regularly Cascade-infected COM files on the drive which were simple to
clean. The APP-File had to be reinstalled.

I don't know the conditions under which that happened, but I think similar
things should also be possible with DLLs and other viruses.

DAME is not a virus. It is a routine that virus authors use to encrypt the
vius. DAME is an acronym for Dark Avenger's Mutation Engine. Most of the
time this routine goes by MtE.

MtE adds about 3.5K overhead to the virus.

Scanners are good for one thing.

detecting known viruses (preferably before running an infected file)

For a better defence, keep  a scanner updated, and use a generic virus
detector to detect viruses that get around the scanner.

Scanner:

I recommend the following.

F-Prot
VIRx
Scan.

These rank highest in my tests.

Generic virus detection software,

Victor Charlie
PC-Rx
Untouchable
Integrity Master
PC-cillin.

Each of these have strengths and weaknesses, so read some literature, and
buy the one that seems to fill your needs.

Subject: standardization (PC)

I may be stepping out of bounds here. But here goes anyway.

I feel that the authors of scanners need to get together, and agree on a
naming system.

A friend of mine recently had a bout with 1575, and he had two scanners.
McAfee's Scan, and F-Prot.

Anthony ran each scanner, and he was told that he had two viruses. 1575,
and Green Catepillar.

Anthony was beside himself. He thought he had two viruses, and F-Prot
detected one, and Scan detected another one. He called me to help.

I drove over and quickly found the problem, and explained that he only had
one virus, and different scanners uses a different naming system.

If someone has Frodo, and is using three different scanners, s/he could
get three different names.

Frodo
4096
IDF
Century
etc.

These authors meen to get together and nail down a coherent naming system
to prevent this problem. If they can't work out a naming system for every
known virus, start with the 60 or so common viruses that are known to be
in the wild, and go from there.

Climbing down from soapbox now.

In theory this sounds a good idea, but in practise the length of a
program tells us far more about the skill of the programmer than
about the complexity of the task.  It has been shown, BTW, that any
program can be reduced to zero length (1.).

Still I suppose that if you compare programs written by the same
person you will get a better idea of the relative complexity, but
even this will be biased, as the programmer should be able to do a
much better job the second time round.

I didn't notice Frisk's posting, but gather it quoted similar
figures (actually rather smaller; MtE 174).  I looked up our
listings, & got the following figures. We don't bother to
differentiate between V2P2 & V2P6.  As neither is in the wild, and
we don't attempt to disinfect them, there is no need to separate
them.

  V2P2/V2P6     82 total lines     123 bytes
  MtE          241   "     "       392   "
  Slovakia     162   "     "       345   "

In each case this is the full subroutine containing all necessary
data (apart from a small standard block specifying the type of file,
etc, in a table with entries for all viruses, which is used for
initial selection).  Each subroutine is passed a pointer to the
file, which has already been loaded into a buffer.

Our program is written in assembler, and the figures seem to bear
out my belief that HLLs confer much less advantage than is generally
claimed.

The only virus I know which interferes with the CMOS is AntiCad.  It
wipes the setup info, but only after it has written rubbish all
through your hard disk, so it certainly didn't cause this problem.

Unfortunately viruses are a godsend to the incompetent servicemen
and purveyors of rubbish.  We even had one case where a resistor on
the disk controller card had burnt out (and emitted visible smoke),
yet the PC shop would not repair it under warranty "because the
damage had been caused by a virus"!

Well, those names are aliases...Zerotime/Slow is actually a variant of
Jerusalem, with an encryption layer added.  There are two known variants -
Jerusalem.Zerotime.Scotts_Valley and Jerusalem.Zerotime.Australian...but it
seems you have encountered the third one.

F-PROT refuses to remove it, because it does not match any of the known
variants, and removal might therefore fail...adding removal should be easy,
once I receive a sample of the virus from somewhere.

Not a special version - this is just an option...enabled by the /DISK command

 I had noticed that F-Prot v2.07 did detect it (to what extent, I have
 not had an opportunity to effectively measure), but since there were
 no references to it within the F-Prot documentation ("New viruses --
 detection added..") or from within the program itself ("Not yet
 analysed"), I suspect that detection of TREMOR was a last minute
 addition.

 I have FindVirus 6.07 (drivers dated 19/11/1992), which of course do
 not detect this virus. Would you happen to know if there is an avenue
 (electronic, of course) to obtain driver updates, other than waiting
 for regular postal delivery for registered users? If not, I'll pester
 him at the Ides conference next month. :-)

 What _exactly_ is it's infection criteria? Although I've had barely
 enough time to read my E-mail in the past two weeks, I have noticed
 that it is _very_ selective about it's targets.

 A side note: Tarkan's VDS Pro v1.0 handles it nicely with it's
 generic approach. :-)

F-PROT does NOT write to the boot sector at all (well, unless you have
a boot sector virus and disinfect it).  If the BSV is modified, it
must be done by some other program...actually, there are certain
versions of DOS (Zenith 3.3, for example) that modify the Boot sector
regularly, but DOS 5.0 does not change it as far as I know.  I would
suggest you made a "before" and "after" hex dump of the boot sector
and compared them...

Subject: two new viruses (PC)

I have discovered two new viruses today. One companion infector, and one

Companion infector.

This companion infector is not resident, uses the MtE, and not infectious
in the second and third generation

the infections I have captured vary from 6686 bytes, - to 6737 bytes.

File infector.

This file infector is approximately 2800 bytes.

When users run an infected file, this virus will try to infect every .COM,
and .EXE in the current directory.

It was made by the MPC
very difficult to get the infected files to run.

I will be sending these to to some CARO memebers that I know, so these can
be added to the CARO catalog.

Both of these viruses are in the wild.

Hi fellow virus-buster,

this seems to be a common problem so I decided to comment on the explicit
virus-eradicating procedure Ulysses reported. Definitely, the authors
of virus scanners should enhance their documentation, and the users
should bother to read it!

Now, any disk operation (such as DIR or, indeed, SCAN) involving B: will
read the infected boot sector into memory.

You've ordered it yourself, as explained above.

But relax: the virus is not active, your computer is not infected; the
virus code simply is siting somewhere in memory where it never will be
executed, and where it will be overwritten sooner or later. The only way
to infect your computer would be to (inadvertently) boot it from the
infected disk (or any equivalent thereof such as using DEBUG to
explicitely execute the copy of the bootsector sitting in memory).

At this point, you should either re-boot your computer, or insert a clean
disk into B: and DIR it. This will overwrite the buffer, so SCAN will
not be fooled into rising a false alarm.

> 9) Ran scan on B:.  Virus found in memory. (Again, HOW???), but NOT

Now, your B: is clean, and so is your computer (only SCAN does not
believe so).

Do not forget to scan all computers that have been in contact with the
infected disk, and then in turn all disks that have been in contact with
any computer you may find infected, and then in turn all computers ...

No. Rather it was loaded by DOS, and "in memoroy" does not imply "active"
(whilst "active" indeed does imply "in memory").

I've experienced the same problem, using Integrity Master and Stacker

To recover from the incident, you need a quick and reliable virus
scanner (cf. infra). Use it in the following way:

1. To clean the HDs, repeat, for each computer in the lab and in the
   institute you got the virus from, the following steps:

   1.1 Power off for at least 90 seconds, insert clean DOS (same version
       as on the HD) disk into drive A, switch on. Make sure the
       computer boots from the floppy disk (otherwise change the BIOS
       setup, then repeat step 1.1).

   1.2 Insert clean disk with your favourite scanner, and scan HD for
       boot sector viruses. Take notes, which computers are reported as
       infected.

   1.3 If computer is infected with FORM (or any other Boot Record Virus)
       then insert again the clean DOS disk, and enter
           SYS C:
       Note: this does not cure Master Boot Record Viruses such as
       Brain, Stoned, or Michelangelo.

   1.4 To re-boot from the HD, take out the disk from drive A, then
       press Ctrl-Alt-Del, or power off and on again. Make sure the
       computer boots from the hard disk (otherwise change the BIOS
       setup, then repeat step 1.4).

   1.5 To be on the safe side, check HD again with a good virus scanner.

2. For each computer found infected in step 1.2, collect *all* floppy
   disks that were in contact with it. Really, all of them! Search
   shelfs, drawers, pockets, bags! Do not even overlook disks used as
   book-markers or saucers! Cross-examine users and operators!

   Invoke your favourate virus scanner on a clean computer, and check
   the floppy disks you collected. Take notes, which disks are
   infected.

3. Get a supply of empty floppy disks, and format them on a clean
   computer. Then, for *every* disk found infected in step 2, repeat:

   3.1 If it is a system disk, make sure that the system you are using
       is the same version as that on the floppy, then enter:
          SYS A:

       If it is a non-system disk, then copy all *files* from it to an
       empty and (cleanly) formatted disk, using XCOPY, or an equivalent
       utility. Do *not* use DISKCOPY (or equivalent), as the latter will
       include the boot sector with the copy. Make sure the copy is com-
       plete, then re-format the infected disk, and use it for any pur-
       pose.

   3.2 To be on the safe side, check the floppy again with a good virus
       scanner.

   3.3 Notify the users and operators of all computers that may have been
       in contact with the infected disk, and ask them to repeat steps
       1 to 3, for their computer -- up to, and including, step 3.3!

This is the generic method for boot sector infectors. Instead of steps
1.3 and 3.1 you may wish to exert the Disinfect option of a virus
scanner. This will work, if the scanner does identify the virus beyond
any doubt; but if the scanner tries to disinfect a virus that is not
properly identified (perhaps a new variant of an old virus), it may do
more harm than good.

In case of a student lab, you may not find all relevant disks in step 2,
or all relevant coputers in step 3.3. In this case, install a monitoring
virus scanner on all computers; this sort of scanner will alert the
students of infected disk as they bring them to the lab, and it will
not allow to use these disks with your machines. However, no software
can stop your students from booting deliberately from infected disks
(which will necessitate you into repeating the whole procedure outlined
above).

The shareware version of F-PROT from Frisk Software can be licenced for
US$ 1.00 per computer per year (minimum $20.00 per site per year), mass
discounts and educational discounts may apply. This does not include
delivery, nor individual support. Rather, you are supposed to fetch
the software (including documentation) from a suitable file server, and
handle virus incidents on your own.

F-PROT is updated, roughly every other month. In reviews, its virus
scanner usually ranks among the top three, world-wide. It also comprises
a monitoring virus scanner named VIRSTOP, a heuristic scanner (which can
alert you from hitherto unknown viruses, but is not as accurate as the
known-virus scanner), and a database of known-virus descriptions (though
rather terse ones).

I think, F-PROT is the best value you can get for the least money. I
hasten to add that I am not commercially connected to Frisk Software --
I'm just a satisfied user.
