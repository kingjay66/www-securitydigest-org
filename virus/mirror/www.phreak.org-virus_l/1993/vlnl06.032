VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  (The complete set of posting guidelines is available by
FTP on cert.org or upon request.) Please sign submissions with your
real name.  Send contributions to VIRUS-L@LEHIGH.EDU.  Information on
accessing anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is
distributed periodically on the list.  A FAQ (Frequently Asked
Questions) document and all of the back-issues are available by
anonymous FTP on cert.org (192.88.209.5).  Administrative mail
(comments, suggestions, and so forth) should be sent to me at:
<krvw@FIRST.ORG>.

Subject: Virus Survey Results


In November, I distributed a questionnaire to this group on the subject
of computer viruses.  10 of you responded, and to those of you, I take
this opportunity to thank you once again.  So many respondents
requested that I share my findings with them, that I thought I'd simply
send them to this list.  I am including the questionnaire itself for
reference, since the culled results are fairly terse.  I have UUENCODED
the results because, although it is straight text, the table is wider
than 80 characters, which may be too much for some mailers.  I hope the
UUENCODING causes no headaches for anyone.  The program is available on
(nearly) all UNIX systems and on a great many PCs as well.  A PC
version is available via anonymous FTP from info.umd.edu in the file
/info/Computers/PC/Unix/uuexe520.zip.

	I think that the polymorphic compiler approach is still
stronger than that of the existing polymorphic engines.  It also has
the advantage that it will work fine in operating systems and
environents that don't like self-modifying code.  The compiler could
even re-compile itself, so that there wouldn't be one speck of
invariant code.  Although many of the simple approaches could waste a
greal deal of space by adding randomized jumps, etc, an efficient
polymorphic compiler could probably work about as well as a
poorly-optimized conventional compiler, if not better.  Register
allocations could be randomized, code could be spaghettied and one
could store different implementations for primitive operations.

	Definitely, the most advanced cryptography technology
availible should be used.  The problem is that the keys have to be
laying around somewhere, even if you are using a public key system --
although in that case you might be able to store the private key
offline except when the database for the program needs to be updated.
Deleting a checksum database would probably be a bad idea for a virus
- -- and having your integrity checker choke would certainly be a
warning sign.  It would make more sense for a virus to alter the CRCs
if it were possible for it to read the altered coefficients, keys, or
whatever it needs to make validation data.

>Oh, yes, and it is enough to make the executable different each time.
>You don't need to bother with the names of the data files, if you

>

	I would agree that a program should allow the user to decide
where to put important files and what their names should be, but a
program that is going to be used by the general population is going to
have to have some kind of defaults.  Anyone who is fairly computer
literate won't have any problem thinking up creative names, but the
majority of computer users out there know about word processing and
games.  I've seen people "freeze up" while trying to do simpler things
than just pick a couple of filenames.  As such, the program probably
should ask the user if he wants to select names for the data base
files, and if he doesn't, it should go around and hide them all
automatically.

  I agree that scanners shouldn't scream and yell when they detect a
virus floating in RAM that isn't active. Yet on the other hand,
nothing should be taken for granted as to where a virus is, as stated
above.

  I think it best that scanners should check interrupt vectors and so
forth to determine if the virus is active, then inform the user as to
the presence of the virus, and whether or not it is active.
Flexibility is the best policy.

Well I have all of the pieces, just not ready for Prime Time but others are
welcome. Basically all of the information is there (I include a write-up
in the FixMBR.DOC that comes with the FixUTIL3.ZIP - incidently half of
those are FREEWARE and the rest are on free trial until 7th March again
this year).

First you have the BIOS information retrievable with Int 13 Fn 08. This will
tell you what the CMOS thinks the whole disk is (tracks, heads sectors).

Next you have the Partition Table - this lists the logical drive information
for each partiton (starting sector, number of sectors, partition type).

Then you have the Dos Boot Record which gives the same information as the
partition table for each partition.

If there are multiple partitions, each will have its own DBR (and a recovery
program could just "walk the disk" looking for them) since DOS 3.0 they
*must* be in the same place.

Thus the information can be found in not one but *four* different places
on a DOS disk (Unix or Novell are different but the info is still there -
just keep fresh batteries in your TI Programmer 8*).

Right now I have other things to do, like painting my house 8*(

Subject: PC Magazine reviews virus scanners (PC)

Have others seen the March 16, 1993 issue of PC Magazine yet? Normally, I
wouldn't expect this group to care much, but this magazine has tremendous
influence in the industry. A summary:

1.	Editors' choices are CPAV and NAV.

2.	The great grandaddy of virus scanners, Mc Afee's Viruscan family,
	was not reviewed. Nor was F-prot (though the commercial version was
	reviewed), except as an aside: "... for those comfortable with
	command line operation ... original F-prot".
	^^^^^^^^^^^^

3.	Scanning tests involved 11 -- count them -- 11 viruses.

4.	Review emphasized completeness of package: disinfection,
	comprehensiveness of service etc, not detection ability.

Somehow, this review seems out of sync with almost everything I've read
here about virus scanners. Opinions? It seems to me a letter to the
letters page signed by a major virus researcher (or ten :-) ) would carry
a lot of weight.

Subject: Michelangelo detect/removal instructions (PC)

Greetings - given we are again approaching March 6, I thought it might
be useful to put together some instructions that would allow DOS-savvy
users (yeah, both of them :) to look for Michelangelo without needing
to spend time/dollars tracking down scanning software.

(And yes, I agree that it's important for folks to take further data
protection measures - but it seems like some protection is better than
none, especially given the wide distribution of Michelangelo.)

What I'd like to do is come up with a text-based description of how to
detect and disinfect Michelangelo, and at no cost to users with access
to DEBUG and other DOS utilities. Ideally, this could be handed out at
user group meetings, posted on (cork :) bulletin boards, FAXed to
folks who need it, and so forth.

Seems like the first check should be the amount of system memory
reported by MEM or CHKDSK - which should be 655,360 on a 640K machine.
If a machine has 640K, and MEM/CHKDSK reports system memory of 655,360
- - the machine *as running* cannot be infected, since one of the first
things Mich does is to subtract 2K from the total system memory
reported.

Users whose machines have less common configurations (some amount of
system memory used for other purposes, or with less than 640K of base
RAM) or who want to check disk(s) without booting them, should be able
to do this with DEBUG, like so:

DEBUG

l 0 0 0 1
[to check a floppy in A: - should be 'l 0 2 0 1' to check C:]

s 0 1AC AD 3B 47 02 74 35 B8 01 03 B6 01 B1 03 80 7F 15 FD 74 02 B1 0E 89
0E 08 00

[Moderator's note: the above debug command is a _single_ line of input
to debug.]

[search for Michelangelo signature - signature string swiped out of
Jan Terpstra's VIRSCAN.DAT, revision 930103]

If DEBUG returns an address, it's found the signature, and Michelangelo is
present in the boot sector of the suspect disk - if not, the disk can be
considered Mich-free.

Users who find Mich can overwrite it on floppies with the SYS command;
users who find it on hard disks can overwrite it with FDISK /MBR, if their
FDISK supports it. (If not, they can at least avoid using that machine on
March 6 and pursue some other means of removal)

I see four potential problems with this approach:

1.      It could create a false sense of security, as being Mich-free isn't
the same as being virus-free.

2.      It would be relatively easy to mistakenly generate a false negative
by mistyping the signature string.

3.      It could create stress/panic on the part of those folks for whom
CHKDSK/MEM don't report 655,360, but are uninterested/unwilling to do
further DEBUG diagnosis/detection.

4.      It fails to address non-DOS users of PC architecture systems,
though it ought to give those people a good kick in the right direction to
check themselves with available tools.

However, I see some good features, as well:

1.      It allows people without ready access to other means of detection to
check their systems for infection. I'm relatively well off in that I have
a modem and Internet access, and can pick up new versions of scanners on a
more-or-less monthly basis; but there are folks in the world still chugging
along without easy ways to get software, as well as folks who are put off
by the high prices of commercially available antiviral products.

2.      It might encourage people to take a more active and involved
approach to security.

Anyway, I'm interested in hearing comments from the net about this approach.
I've tested this on my own system with a captured copy of Mich from last year's
follies, and I haven't encountered any anomalies. However .. it's a big world,
potentially full of things I haven't thought of yet.

Ideas/comments/flames?

 In a nutshell, yes. It really depends upon what you mean by a
 "disassembled listing", however. One cannot simply run an
 encrypted virus through a symbolic disassembler and expect
 everything to come out in the wash.

 For more complex viruses, an interactive disassembling aid (SoftICE
 or simply DEBUG) will allow one with enough skill to trace through
 the code and unveil the tricks inside. Kind of like a box of Cracker
 Jacks (tm).   ;-)

 For polymorphic "envelopes" (I dislike the term "engine"), a more
 intensive analysis of the encryption algorithm is required, but
 is being done by many developers on a semi-regular basis.
 (Unfortunately.)

 Natural intelligence will never be completely replaced, but several
 individuals have made great strides in their heuristic analysis
 extensions of examining code. Fridrik Skulason's f-Prot does a
 fantastic job of detecting virus-like code, but does not provide
 as much detail concerning it's findings as the heuristic flags
 logged in Frans Veldman's Thunderbyte AntiVirus. (Opinion, opinion.)

 It sounds like a false positive, but I'd hesitate to draw that
 conclusion. Have you attempted to try a newer version of the product
 or perhaps a current (bourne within the course of the past two
 months) version of another virus detection utility?

 On another note, I am curious as to other what other particpants may
 have experienced with the relationship between PS/2 reference
 diskettes and a possible tendancy for PS/2 shops to have a higher
 percentage of MBR infections (per capita). I have run across several
 "Big Blue" organizations that seem to have a higher percentage of
 MBR infections than non- "Blue" shops. Perhaps the reliance on the
 reference diskettes and lack of safe computing practices at these
 locations combine for a lower tolerance for STONED and FORM
 infections? It would appear that way, at least at first glance,
 but I'll readily admit that apathy in way, shape or form can
 contribute to a tendancy for infection, whether IBM or clone.

Subject: Virus Scanner for BBS (PC)

I am trying to locate a virus scanner for a GT Power BBS.
Preferably I would like to have all file uploads scanned immediately
after they are uploaded. I know ZIPLAB+ does that but it won't work with
GT Power. If I can't automatically scan uploads when they are uploaded
then I'd like to scan uploads as a scheduled even once each day prior to
either placing the files in the approriate files area or removing them
Can anyone help me with this? Thanks!

Yes, it's a "normal" Stacker function.  Stacker creates a pseudo boot
sector on the simulated (compressed) Stacker volume.  For some reason
Stacker insists on constantly changing this sector.  Since you can
not boot from this sector, there's little reason to check its integrity.
A future version of IM will recognize Stacker boot sectors and not
bother to check them.

If you have a recent release of Integrity Master (The current release is
V1.41b but I think I've had the documented since V1.22 or 1.23) the
QUESTION.DOC file describes this and provides some other Stacker related
tips.

Subject: re:waldo (PC)

Hi all,
we had this discussion on win3-l a year ago. When I read the subject I
immediately remembered that. On my PC we regularly ran CorelDRAW 2.0.
And sometimes the system crashed with an UAE and telling something like:
Module Waldo caused a UAE at adress XXXX, or so. NO, WALDO IS NOT A
VIRUS, it probably is a relict of some debugging-code in Corel Draw 2.0.
I can't tell if it still exists in CorelDraw 3.0. I haven't seen it until
now, despite regular GPFs (Win 3.1 was significantly improved, there are no
more UAEs - Unrecoverable Application Errors, now they call them GPFs -
General Protection Failures)
It's not so much of a problem to find WALDO with a hexeditor in CORELDRW.EXE
at offset 0x191 ;)

Hope to help, Alfred

On HDs, FORM does infect the DOS boot record, rather than the Master Boot
Record, as Paul Ferguson seemed to imply.

This detail is important when you try to clean a HD by generic means: you
eradicate a MBR infector (such as Brain, Stoned, and their descendants)
by means of the "FDISK /MBR" command (after making sure that the
partition table is still in place), while you eradicate DBR infectors
(such as FORM) by means of the "SYS C:" command. Needless to say that you
have to clean-boot first, in any case.

You assumed right but checking only the last files, will only give you
a warning AFTER the system is infected, witch will only be detected while
rebooting, so if there is an infection the program that carries the
virus inside the system will not be scanned just after some damage is
done.

The so called overlayfiles are only infectable if they have real EXE
header types. otherwise it is some kind of datafile witch hasn't
got a regular beginning or end (just another binary).
The sys files (like IO.SYS or IBMIO.SYS) are known files,
someone who wants to know where it is executed form can ask it, so
it's rather easy to infect.

#define EXECUTABLES "*.COM *.EXE *.SYS *.OV?"

If speed is the problem, you could try TBSCAN, (availeble on SIMTEL as
TBAV503.ZIP) in quick mode it scans over 700 EXECUTABLES in 15 seconds (on a
213MB harddisk in a 486 SX 25Mhz system), Scanning in normal mode
the same computer does it in 25 seconds, Also the program produses
some highly active screen display so no one will be bored (colors and stuff)
the program also has a feature that stops it form scanning after every
boot-up (you can tell it to only scan once a day).

Subject: Michelangelo discovery and naming (CVP)

HISVIRW.CVP   930210

                 Michelangelo Discovery and Naming

Michelangelo is widely reported (even by the CARO Computer Virus
Catalog) to have been discovered in Europe in the spring or summer
of 1991.  Roger Riordan, however, had reported and named the virus
in Australia in February of 1991.  He suspected that the virus had
been received by the company affected from disks of software from
Taiwan, but this could not be finally determined.

The date in February of 1991 is very telling.  This indicates the
existence of the virus prior to March 6 (the "trigger" date) of
1991.  This further indicates that the virus, although it "destroys"
itself along with the system tracks of disks overwritten on that
date, can survive.  This is not really surprising: few computer
users understand that boot sector infecting viral programs can both
infect and infect from any disk, whether or not it is bootable,
contains any programs or, indeed, contains any files at all.

Riordan determined that March 6 was the trigger date.  He mentioned
this to a friend who remarked that it was his birthday, and who also
happened to know that it was the birthday of the renaissance
painter, sculptor and engineer Michelangelo Buonarotti, born March
6, 1475 in Caprese, Italy.  The name thus comes from the coincidence
of dates.  There is no text in the body of the virus, and certainly
no reference to Michelangelo.  There is no evidence that the author
of the virus knew anything of this connection.

(As a piece of trivia, March 6 is also Ed McMahon's birthday,
leading to jokes about viral messages stating, "Congratulations!
Your computer may already be infected!")

(Interestingly, in Taiwan the virus is widely known as the "Ninja
Turtle" virus.  Obviously, in the young and not highly cultured
world of "teenage mutant ninja hackers", comic book characters are
more familiar than renaissance artists, even though all of the
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" (TM, probably) are named after
painters of that ilk.  However the cartoon/comic/toy characters have
no known association with March 6, and this reference is obviously a
mistaken extension of the Michelangelo name.)

Given the reports of "discovery" of the virus in the summer of 1991,
Michelangelo was very rare in the first half of the year.  (Likely
even rarer on March 7 than it had been on March 5.)  However, it
spread extremely rapidly, and by the fall of the year was
sufficiently widespread that companies were beginning to ship out
products infected with the Michelangelo virus by the beginning of
1992.  By the time the public became generally aware of the need to
check, in late February of 1992, it is likely that the number of
copies was in the millions, if not tens of millions.  Luckily, most
were caught before March 6.

(Upon consideration, maybe "tens of millions" is extreme.  Remember, however,
that I am talking about "copies" of the virus, not "machines destroyed".)

We do have such a guideline, and it is publicly available for comment.
In fact, every new subscriber to VIRUS-L gets a copy of the guideline
document, and it is available by anonymous FTP from:

cert.org:pub/virus-l/virus-l.README

I will gladly e-mail the document to anyone without FTP access.
Should I be distributing it elsewhere?  I could perhaps add it to the
monthly automagic postings on comp.answers and news.answers...

The posting guidelines, as I said, are available for public comment.
If/when the majority of the group wishes to change or add to the
guidelines, I will gladly do so.  If the revisions are such that I
cannot ethically abide by them, then I will step down from being the
group's moderator.

> I would agree to censor raw virus code but would like to consider

The current guidelines prohibit very little other than raw virus code.
They do, however, prohibit the solicitation to copy or exchange raw
virus code.  Beyond that, there is little in the way of technical
discussions that I will not accept for posting.  (Other guidelines
include politeness, relevant to the subject of computer viruses, etc.
For the full list, please read the document.)

Cheers,
