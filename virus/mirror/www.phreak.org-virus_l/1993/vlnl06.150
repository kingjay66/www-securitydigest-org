That was an interesting remark. The energy managing and control systems
that I was involved in the early '80's, were the industries trial and
error systems. The very first systems, and I supposed porely written
modern systems, had very little in the way of electro/mechanical safeguards
to prevent the software from making a system doing itself harm. Boilers
and A/C systems powered themselves up and down, and electrical switchgear
simply shutoff. The majority of the time the problem was in sensory
feedback failure, but on occasion faulty software was to blame.

"We are sorry, the fix will be in the next release, we will be more
than happy to send you a Beta version. Please let us know if they are
any problems. Please send your check to postal box, xxx, Grand Caymen
Island.  ,-)

The nuclear industry probably did the best safeguarding even they have
had some accidents. The most recent I believe to be the one where 3
days went past before someone noticed that the power was off to an idle
reactors safety system. The space shuttle program has its own share
of computer glitches that create hardware (life support, control power
etc.) My point is anytime that software controls that kind of hardware,
and if software errors can create havoc, then a virus can cause blown
fuses, burnt wires etc., given that the virus has an entry point to
the system. It all hinges on the physical safeguards in place and the
human attention given. I haven't read the book yet, however I suspect
the author may be guilty of not explaining in detail the exact steps
the virus took to create the havoc.  When science becomes boring, a
creative author can make it interesting to us unscientific souls.

following questions:

(1) Do you think your system is at risk of computer virus attack?

(2) Do you think you can take reasonable measures that can totally secure
    your system?

McAfee Associates does publish a quarterly newsletter named
(unimaginatively) "Quarterly Update" for licensed (business) users of
our software.  They are mailed out to the point of contact on the site
license.  We usually have a few hundred left over after each mailing,
so if you'd like one (or anyone else reading this) I'd recommend that
you send a postcard to the address in my signature file asking for a

From:    Klaus Brunnstein <brunnstein@rz.informatik.uni-hamburg.d400.de>
Subject: Re:Swiss Anti-Virus Legislation

Based on reactions from participants in this forum, the draft paragraph of
to be incorporated in the Swiss Penal Code was properly updated. After success-
ful discussions with Staenderat (senate), the related law will be discussed in
Swiss parliament, in December 1993. For your information, I forward a message
from Mr. Frigerio about the development and actual status.

Regards === The Messenger === (Klaus Brunnstein, U-Hamburg, Nov.20,1993)

================== Message from Mr. Claudio Frigerio ========================

On November 11, 1993 the Law Committee of the 2nd Chamber of the Parliament
(German: "Staenderat"; a kind of "Swiss Senate") decided to accept the anti-
virus propositions. The Staenderat will probably discuss in Parliament and
decide on the subject by December 1993. In the Law Committee there was
practically no opposition to the law draft; thus it is very likely that the
Staenderat will accept it too. After this the "Nationalrat" (the 1st Chamber of
Parliament, a kind of "Swiss House of Representatives" or "Swiss Congress")
will  discuss the draft and decide about it by Spring 1994.

The Swiss law draft, posted to the net, has been changed considerably in the
last few weeks. The draft actually discussed in Parliament will be:

German text:
Schweizerisches Strafgesetzbuch, Artikel 144bis, Datenbeschaedigung
1. Wer unbefugt elektronisch oder in vergleichbarer Weise
   gespeicherte oder uebermittelte Daten loescht, veraendert oder
   unbraucbar macht, wird, auf Antrag, mit Gefaegnis oder mit Busse
   bestraft.
   Hat der Taeter einen grossen Schaden verursacht, so kann auf
   Zuchthaus bis zu fuenf Jahren erkannt werden. Die Tat wird von
   Amtes wegen verfolgt.
2. Wer Programme, von denen er weiss oder annehmen muss, dass sie
   zu den in Ziffer 1 genanten Zwecken verwendet werden sollen,
   herstellt, einfuehrt, in Verkehr bringt, anpreist, ueberlaesst oder
   sonstwie zugaenglich macht oder zu ihrer Herstellung Anleitung gibt,
   wird mit Gefaegnis oder mit Busse bestraft.
   Handelt der Taeter gewerbsmaessig, so kann auf Zuchthaus bis zu
   fuenf Jahren erkannt werden.

English text:
Swiss Criminal Code, Article 144bis, Damaging of data
1. Anyone, who without authorization deletes, modifies or renders
   useless electronically or similarly saved or transmitted data, will,
   if a complaint is filed, be punished with the imprisonment for a
   term of up to 3 years or a fine of up to 40000 Swiss francs.
   If the person charged has caused a considerable damage, the
   imprisonment will be for a term of up to 5 years. The crime will
   be prosecuted ex officio.
2. Anyone, who creates, imports, distributes, promotes, offers,
   makes available, circulates in any way, or gives instructions to
   create programs, that he/she knows or has to presume to be used
   for purposes according to item 1 listed above, will be punished
   with the imprisonment for a term of up to 3 years or a fine of up
   to 40000 Swiss francs.
   If the person charged acted for gain, the imprisonment will be for
   a term of up to 5 years.

This English translation may not be perfect. The text will be available by
January 1994 in all official Swiss languages: German, French and Italian.

The protected item of this article are just data (immaterial goods). Any damage
to computer systems, like the burning of floppies, plug-pulling, sledgehammers
etc. are damages to "physical/material things" covered by article 144
(Sachbeschaedigung, damage to property).

According to Swiss penal legislation the requisite knowledge and intent
("knowingly and willingly") have not to be mentioned specifically.

As you may have noticed, the "registration" of IS security pros has been
dropped. The expression "that he/she knows or has to presume to be used for
purposes according to item 1 listed above" will exclude any penal responsibi-
lity if the committer e.g. gave a virus to a professional anti-virus software
developer or is creating viruses for research, as in these and similar special
situations a misuse of the virus is highly unlikely. The committer will not be
prosecuted, if he had reasonable motives, to practically exclude a misuse. On a
retrospective analysis the judge will check if the person who gave a viruses to
somebody else (who misused it to cause damage) could in any way be blamed for
not having foreseen the occurred misuse. If you give a virus to a notorious
anti-virus professional, known for spreading viruses or source codes, or simply
to somebody who does not give a special guarantee for not misusing the virus,
you will be prosecuted. Who just trusted in the promise of a virus-recipient,
that the latter will not misuse it, will be in trouble, if he did not have a
very special additional reason to trust him. The law considers viruses as so
dangerous for the general public, that any act making them available to
somebody else, represents a general risk to the general public. Who invokes an
exception,that an act of making a virus available to somebody else, did not
represent such a risk has to prove it.

This may cause some concern, but law can not foresee any situation. Judges will
have to carefully check if the reasons to give a virus to somebody else, were
good enough to practically exclude any misuse.

Making a newly discovered virus available to McAfee or the Virus Test Center
will not be a crime, as long as the reputation of these recipients is above any
suspicion.

As the draft is now in the Parliament, there is practically no way to change
any thing in this text anymore (by the administration). Now it is up to the
politicians to decide about the subject and to make any additional change.

There was a similar report in the November issue of the Virus Bulletin.
In any case, I just phoned BRM (the producers of Untouchable and
Search & Destroy) and was told that, contrary to rumors, and contrary
even to what FGS Tech Support may have been saying up to now, there
has not yet been a final decision as to the future of these products.
However, he implied that whatever the decision, the *capabilities* of
these packages would continue to be available in one form or another.

	The product I work on, Virex for the PC, detects S-Bug reliabley
in the 2.91 version and greater.  We don't attempt to repair it.

	A lot of the information in the LAN Times article was inaccurate

worth special media attention.  It would be nice if its author would turn
his efforts to more productive endeavors.

	During the work I did on the decryptor-detector for Satin_Bug, I
noticed the routine seemed very familiar.  It was the same as I had seen in
another, non-resident, virus which called itself "FruitFly".  Also written
by Little_LOC, who could be doing more interesting things if he were to try.

One sidenote about the activation effect of Form. If a keyboard handler
(typically KEYB.COM) is loaded, the keyboard ticks caused by Form are
not heard at all. This happens because KEYB takes over the INT 09h
(keyboard interrupt).

Since a very large number of PCs (perhaps even half of all the installed
systems) are running KEYB.COM or a similar program to provide a national
keyboard setup, it is quite important to take this into account when
talking about the activation effect of Form. On such PCs, Form will not
seem to activate in any way.

Hi,

we had to unload vshield in order to get WINDOWS working correctly.
Why don4t you use vshield just for checking and unload it afterwards?
BTW, SCAN is slow, indeed, but an infection doesn4t only slow down
work, it STOPS IT. I think those few seconds of delay are REALLY
neglectible. Also, there4s another product by McAfee called SENTRY.
Don4t know how good it is, but it sure IS fast...

The "Sorry, I need more..." error message occurs when VIRUSCAN can not
allocate enough memory on the PC in question to scan a file for
viruses.

I would first recommend that you check the PC you are running SCAN on
to make sure that it does have enough memory.  Remember, 390 kilobytes
= 399,360 bytes, not 390,000 bytes.

Next, check to see if you are using a foreign language support file
with SCAN.  It would be named as MCAFEE.MSG and in the same directory
as the SCAN.EXE file.  Running SCAN with an FLS file will increase
SCAN's memory usage by the size of the file (typically 15Kb +/- 2Kb or
so).

If you are running SCAN out of a batch file or network login script,
try placing the DOS MEM command (or something like it) in the
batch/script file to see how much memory is available when SCAN is
called.

Lastly, what version of SCAN are you using?  V107 had a problem in
that it would allocate memory from DOS without releasing it, causing
it to run out of memory to read files into.  If you are using V107,
upgrade to V108 or above (V109 was just released and should be at the
SimTel ftp site shortly) and try running that in its place.

Subject: Restoring Floppy's Boot Sector (PC)

Thanks to an earlier query here about cleaning boot-sector
diskettes off of floppies, a reader of this group (I'm sorry,
I lost the name, but thank you anonymous wizard!) sent me a simple
debug script for getting a good boot sector
off of a known uninfected diskette, and another one to write
a boot sector.  They look like this, and they work like a charm:

- ------------------------------------------------------------
read boot sector to file goodbt
- ------------------------------------------------------------
l 100 0 0 1
n goodbt.
rcx
200
rbx
0
w
q
- ------------------------------------------------------------
write boot sector image from file goodbt
- ------------------------------------------------------------
n goodbt
l 100
w 100 0 0 1
q
- ------------------------------------------------------------

Of course, I need to have one boot sector image for each size
disk we commonly use here (720 and 1440), and I also have to
do:

debug < WRITEHD.DBG

Here's my question.  Is there a soul out there who can tell me
how to make these debug scripts into EXE or COM files?  I have never
used DEBUG outside of a classroom (I shy away from Intel
chips as a rule anyway.  Never could appreciate their sense of humor
- -- writing each byte in pig latin like that).  I suspect it would
just be one more line or two of DEBUG

There is no need to check for the DOS version. A program working at
sector-level would most likely not work very well with OS/2 and
Windows-NT. Since the low-level support on these platforms are not
sufficient to do "safe" sector reading the same way you do in DOS. A
different program would be needed for running under OS/2 and Windows-NT.

But, talking about future DOS compatibility is something else. The
type of filesystem (FAT/HPFS/NTFS/etc) is described in a one-byte
field in the partition-table (contained in the HD's first sector). And
as long as your program is able to read at sector-level, it should
have no problems finding out what kind of file system it is dealing
with, and use different routines for the different file systems.

To handle the low-levels of HPFS and NTFS may not be as easy as
handling the FAT filesystem. So programs like TBScan might have to
tell the user that only FAT partitions may be scanned in a low-level
manner.

Hi.  I've got a little problem trying to disinfect Stoned in a PS/2 system.

F-Prot 2.09f identifies the virus as a new variant of Stoned and refuses to
kill the virus.

Clean 108 says there is not enough memory, and that it needs at least 390K
of free RAM to run.  The PS/2 has just 512K of RAM.  The startup files (auto-
exec.bat and config.sys) were renamed to avoid loading of TSRs and device
drivers.

Norton's DiskEdit version 7.0 (the only one I have) DOES NOT RUN on 8086's...

Subject: How to clean Exebug2 ? (HELPME, please, please ) (PC)

Hello ...

By mistake I've switched on my computer with a non system diskette.
The error message stating that it was not a system disk appeared, so I did
take the diskette off and rebooted the computer.
Knowing of the existence of virus that 'live' on diskette's boot, the
first thing I did was:
c:> scan a:
Scan stated that the Exebug2 was in memory (and in my disk off course).

After booting from a DOS 6.0 clean boot diskette I can't access drive C.
If I want the see the partitions on the HD, fdisk is confused.
If I boot from the HD everything seems normal (but I didn't run anything,
but scan, from the HD).

I've read the virlist that come with scan and clean and saw that among
other things the Exebug2 virus afects the HD partition table. They say
that the desinfector for this virus is M-Disk (not clean). I looked for
this with archie and found only a version that the largest DOS that
accepts is DOS 4.0.

Can anyone out there help me ? How can I remove the virus ? If it is with
M-Disk where can I find a version compatible with DOS 6.0 ? If not, what
is the program(s) tha are good for this virus ?

Thak you in advanced

Well, in spite of all things people are going to say: vsumx is (mostly)
made available *through* McAfee's ftp site. This, and the fact that mcafee
is one of the oldest around, makes me think the tests for the vsumx-scores
are not very thorough.
I'll elaborate on this by means of a test a Dutch magazine (Personal
Computer Magazine) held in November this year.

They tested the software on three areas. They explicitely did not test
the resident parts.
They had a virus-test-bank with 11.383 files, all infected with another virus.
For a large part it was compiled with the help of the VSG (DUtch: virus
strategy group), a dutch collaboration of researchers, government and
companies.
The three categories were: 'normal' viruses (for practical reasons just the
com and .exe infectors), which all were *at least* a year old.
'new' viruses (less than a year old)
Last one: '40 polymorf virus-types', by making about 5.000 different
replicants of them.
CPAV crashed on some viruses, so this one was not included in the 'hit-rate'
The scores:
software                              normal    new   polymorf
Thunderbyte TBAV 6.05                 >99      >99     >99
Sohos Vaccine 4.38 & Sweep 2.53        97.9    >83      88.4
F-Prot Pro 2.09                       >98       85.6    83
McAfee Viruscan-VShield-Cleanup 106    94.1     60.5    92.1
Dr. Solomons anti-virus toolkit 6.54   96.7     61.3    62.9
PC Vaccine Professional 1.21           94.5     40.9   >74
IBM Antivirus 1.03                     92.9     61.5    47.7
Norton Antivirus 2.1                   71.5     20      40
Microsoft Anti-virus                   70       19.8    27

I think that these test give at least one clue (but I'll mention
some other things too) :
***1) avoid Microsoft and Norton
***2) The best combination: use TBAV and F-Prot (as they have very
      good results AND are not that expensive). McAfee and Sophos
      are reasonably reliable, but don't depend on them alone (like
      you should never do !!)
***3) Use (in combination of one of those anti-virus packages) an
      integrity checker. One of the best (as far as I know) is
      Integrity Master, but there should be others around too.
      McAfee, Dr. Solomon and Sophos seem to have rather reliable
      ones.
***4) Always scan *new* (e.g. brought back from a friend) disks
      before just copying files to your hard disk. A resident
      AV can come in handy.
***5) Last but not least (as far as my remarks will go) try to keep
      very up to date, as this can save you a lot of trouble.
      Use (if available for you) ftp-sites for this:
      oak.oakland.edu, garbo.uwasa.fi, nic.funet.fi, complex.is,
      ftp.twi.tudelft.nl, urvax.umich.edu (not sure about the address)
      or some others. Read the FAQ in comp.virus or check this
      newsgroup and you will be kept up-to-date.
      Mail me if you want to be informed about new TBAV releases.

NOTE: I have no affiliation with any of the aforementioned companies.
      I'm just a user of some products and happily trust my TBAV
      resident programs. For me it was (although I knew it was rather
      reliable) a kind of a surprise that TBAV came out 'best'.

NOTE 2: mail me if you want to know more details on this test and I will
        try to answer any questions.

Subject: McAfee VIRUSCAN 109 uploaded to the SimTel Software Repository (PC)

I have uploaded to the SimTel Software Repository (available by anonymous
ftp from the primary mirror site OAK.Oakland.Edu and its mirrors):

pub/msdos/virus/

4nsh155.zip     NETSHLD V1.55 virus prevention for Novell 4.x

WHAT'S NEW

VIRUSCAN adds detection of 114 new viruses and 167 variants,
bringing the total number of viruses detected to 1,769, or
counting variants, 2,632 viruses.

CLEAN-UP adds a remover for the Invisible Man [IMF] virus.

NETSHIELD is now at Version 1.55 (V109) and has been Tested and
Approved compatible by Novell, Inc. for use with Novell NetWare
v3.11, v3.12, SFT-III v3.11, 4.01, and NetWare for OS/2 4.01.

Two files are available, one containing the NetWare v3.x version
of NETSHIELD, and one containing the NetWare v4.x version.

A few notes about using NETSHIELD Version 1.55 for NetWare v3.x:

o       Other antivirus NLM's should not be used simultaneously
        with NETSHIELD

o       The Novell file SPXFIX2.NLM must be loaded when running
        NETSHIELD.  SPXFIX2.NLM fixes a problem that NETSHIELD
        and several other NLM's have in NetWare 3.x with SPX.

o       The latest version of the Novell file CLIB.NLM (Version
        3.11 revision D) must be loaded when running NETSHIELD.
        NETSHIELD will not load correctly if an older version of
        CLIB.NLM is used.*

        *Specifically, a message about "IsColorMonitor" not
         being declared will pop up and NETSHIELD fails to load.

Both files are available directly from Novell, or your Novell
network provider.  They are on CompuServe in the NOVLIBRARY
Forum and may be available elsewhere as well.  We are currently
checking to see if these files may be made available by McAfee
Associates.

And a note about NETSHIELD Version 1.55 for NetWare v4.x:

o       When running NETSHIELD under NetWare 4.x during heavy
        file server utilization, if NETSHIELD's priority option
        is set to a lower value (increasing the priority given
        to NETSHIELD), then some of the low priority threads
        will not be given a chance to execute.  When the
        utilization drops the threads will execute.

And a mcafee.com bandwidth note:

Over the past couple of months, we have had several reports of
slow access and timeouts when connecting to the mcafee.com anonymous
ftp site due to increasing numbers of users logging on at the same
time to download the programs.

As of November 1, we have upgraded from our former switched-56 line
to a full T-1 connection, providing some 20 times the capacity of the
former.

Subject: Antiviral BBS listing

As with the CONTACTS.LST sent out last week, I would ask that all readers
check this listing for accuracy.

The V.I.R.U.S./Virus Doctor BBS List

A number of those who have access to viral information or antiviral software
only through commercial systems (or long distance calls) have requested
listings of "local" access to antiviral sources.  This list is an attempt to
provide such information.  Additions and corrections are solicited to help make
this a more useful reference source.

For sorting purposes the wide variety of bracket, slash, space and hyphen
placement have been replaced with the European standard "global" area codes.
I have used hyphens instead of blank spaces when separating the "global",
"country" and "city" codes.  Every phone number begins with the global area
code; this code is "1" for USA and Canada.  To prevent misinterpretation, the
global area code is preceded with a "+" sign, and delimited by a hyphen.  The
(national) area code is delimited from the local phone number by another
hyphen.  (Thanks to Otto Stolz for his assistance.)

In order to avoid line wrap on Fidonet mail readers, the "node number" has been
"right justified" at 75 columns.  For those on the Internet, it is possible to
send mail to these systems.  The node number is in the format
<zone>:<net>/<node> and can be converted to an Internet address as
user.name@f<node>.n<net>.z<zone>.fidonet.org, so that Rob Slade may be reached
at The Cage (1:153/733, see "+1-604") as Rob.Slade@f733.n153.z1.fidonet.org.
VirNet sites can be addressed as
Fname.Lname@f<node>.n<net>.z<zone>.virnet.bad.se at the moment.

Information included, where available, is name of system, name of sysop, city,
province/state/country, information carried and Fidonet address.  If a product
is associated, that is included as well.

Key:

AM = Amiga          AT = Atari          MC = Macintosh          PC = MS-DOS
Fidonet:  VIRINF = VIRUS_INFO   VIR = VIRUS   WRN = WARNINGS   VNT = VirNet
Files archived: CVP = Computer Viral Programs column  RVW = Antiviral reviews

Where verification is possible, the "node number" is followed by a "V" and the
initials of the reviewer.
