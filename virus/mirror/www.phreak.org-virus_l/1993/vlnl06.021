Subject: re. Patriotic Virus Writers

Regarding the item in the Digest V6 #16, it was reported in the
British press on 3-feb-93 that 6 members of this 'ARCV' group have
been arrested.  The report says that the group may have written 30-50
relatively harmless viruses, distributed via bulletin boards, some of
which have spread e.g. to Ohio.

No charges have been made as yet, but the equipment has been seized
and the viruses are being analyzed.

  Concerning the alternative argument which I gave for undecidability
of virushood (? virality?) of a program, Jerry Leichter writes:

Correct, but my argument was proposed as an alternative to Fred's
informal proof of undecidability, which goes something like this:
  Suppose there were a function D which inputs a program file p and
which always halts, correctly outputting 'true' whenever p is a virus
and 'false' whenever it isn't.  Then let P be a program consisting of
only the following code:
                       If not D(P) then infect
Now (1) if D(P) = true, then P does nothing, so P is not a virus, so D
has erred.  (2) If D(P) = false, then P infects, i.e. P is a virus, so
again D has erred.
  My point is that the same comment which you made above, Jerry, ap-
plies just as well to Fred's proof.  So maybe you should redirect that
comment to him.

Again, I was writing under the influence of Fred's paper, where the
problem is treated as a theoretical one.  As soon as we turn to
*practical* considerations, the picture changes.  As I've said
previously, if a detector produces no false negatives, and if the
only false positives which it produces are of the above type (i.e.
declaring the program to be a virus even though <condition> is never
satisfied), we would have a very valuable detector indeed.  If you
wish to redefine 'virus' so that these are not even considered false
positives, I won't object too strongly.

  Well, scanners are fantastic for determining how wide-spread a virus
is on your system, and great for determining just what you've been infected
with, but you must already be infected for them to aid you in any way.
They also cannot handle new and unknown viruses. For this reason they
don't make an effective front-line defense.

  Active Monitor TSR prgorams can help catch a virus in the act, but
often drastically reduce system performance and memory space. If you are
in a high-risk environment, it can be worth the loss. HOWEVER- Some of
the newer ones are getting more efficient in both speed and size.

  It really is a controversial topic as to which virus utilities are
better than others. Just remember that the sheer number of viruses a
scanner can detect is not the only important factor. You also need to
know how fast it is, how accurately it identifies the virus, how many
false positives you get, how many false negatives you get, whether
or not it can detect the 10% or so of the viruses that are actually
out 'in the wild', etc..

  Hope that helps!  :-)

Subject: Viral antivirals - one vote against

There have been discussions on the advisability of using viral programs to
search out other viral programs.  While there are certainly advantages to
using the power of viral replication and propagation, most are unwilling
to risk the possible consequences should the "antiviral virus" develop
bugs or run into an unexpected environment or situation.

I have recently come into contact with a viral antiviral program.  An
Atari lab that I am working with has most of the disks "infected" with
a program that checks for "executable" boot sectors.  If one is found, it
is replaced with the "antiviral" code.  This is all done "automatically"
without any reference to the user.

(I have not yet been able to identify the specific program.  The only
identificationis the message given at boot time:
     "This Anti Virus beeps and flashes
      if the actual bootsector is executable,
      then that might be a Virus:
      Remove this Anti-Virus by reset:")

To date I have not found any way to remove it (not being familiar with
Atari internals), nor has the person who initially installed it. It is
now interferring with some of the systems we need to run: particularly
an MS-DOS emulator.  The "bootable" MS-DOS disks keep getting killed.

A scanner does not "protect" you, unless it is actively used to scan all
incoming software before it is used...and even then it cannot "protect" you
against a brand new virus.

However, the authors of scanners, such as myself, are generally able to stay
one step ahead of the virus authors...partly because it takes a less time
to distribute a new scanner world-wide, than for a virus to become widespread
by normal means.

Also, as people tend to get hit only by 100 or so of the 2000 PC viruses that
exist, and as those 100 viruses are generally detected by most scanners,
they do, yes, provide a certain degree of protection...if properly used.

I thought about this almost immediately after I posted the message,
but I decided to wait until after the first replies came back before I
posted anything else.  There is a limit to how much a virus can change
its functionality, since the "parent" must contain within itself the
changes it is going to make in the "child," and if the "child" or some
later generation is going to eventually produce a copy of the original
"parent," it must contain all the functionality of the "parent" as
well.  Take, for example, a bipartite (two-part) virus which infects
files and boot sectors.  The file infector must contain not only the
functions which infect the boot sector but those which will eventually
infect files again.  Likewise, the boot infector must contain not only
the file infector but what will again be the boot infector.

In this example, neither the boot infector nor the file infector alone
produce "functional duplicates" of themselves.  Together, though, the
boot infector and the file infector are considered one virus, designed
to go through two infection steps, and together as one virus they
produce a "functional duplicate" of the pair.  With this example, I'll
agree that my wording "functional duplicate" is poor, but I am at a
loss to come up with a better term.  I don't think that "possibly
evolved copy" is suitable, because "evolved" implies an involuntary
change.  Any functional changes made in the copy will be those which
have been intentionally coded for the original to make.

Oh, yes, they DO intercept program execution!  A non-resident virus
may not intercept DOS interrupts or whatever, but it intercepts the
call to the original program; otherwise, it would never get executed.
If a virus doesn't intercept program execution in some way -- ANY
way -- it would never be run, never spread, and thus not be a virus.

Okay.

> So, let's try again:

Here goes:

     A computer virus is a sequence (or sequences) of symbols which,
     when executed or interpreted under certain conditions or in
     certain environments, will make a functional duplicate of this
     sequence (or sequences) and will place this duplicate where it
     will intercept program execution at a later time under certain
     conditions.  This is called "replication" and the duplicate
     retains at least the capability to recursively replicate further.
     A virus may also have additional functions, but these functions
     are necessary for something to be called a virus.

I like your addition about 'replication."

Hmmm... let's see... Suppose a hostile PC program locates a file like
FUBAR.EXE and *adds* a program FUBAR.COM, which is a duplicate of
itself, but doesn't *replace* anything.  Is it a "companion worm?"  Or
suppose a hostile Macintosh program *adds* a WDEF resource, which is a
duplicate of itself, to the Finder "Desktop" file, but doesn't
*replace* anything.  Is it a "WDEF worm?"  I think that the boundaries
have become sufficiently fuzzy to make continued separation between
"worms" and "viri" purely academic.  But anyway, enough of this....

I don't know what the people you talked to think, but a scanner *can not*
and is not intended to be a general "cure-all". A scanner can only
assist you in detecting those computer viruses known to its programmer
at the time when the version of the scanner you are using was released.
Some time ago I asked the manufacturer of a scanner (don't remember who
it was) why most companies highlight their scanners and talk much less
about their checksumming products? He told me that users seem to like
scanners (maybe because it is easier for them to grasp how a scanner
works than a checksumming product).
The big advantage of a checksummer is that it protects you against many
more things than just computer viruses. Disadvantage: Checksumming takes
longer than scanning (at least now; if there is more polymorphic viruses
around, checksumming will be faster at one point)...

Subject: Virus Stats Wanted

From the "I don't know where else to look" department:

Is there anyone or any place that is a repository for virus stats, as in
estimated numbers of computers infected, that kind of thing, for 1992 or the
few years previous? I've been asked to give my virus presentation for
another class at the University in a few weeks, and since I've not updated
the presentation in a couple of years (and I have a few weeks to prepare), I
thought I'd try to get some more up-to-date numbers. 1992 is particlarly
interesting to me because of the Michelangelo scare, but I'd be happy for
anything more recent than 1989.

The class I'm giving this presentation to is an information retrieval class,
and the instructor has told me that the general attitude of the class
towards viruses and the seriousness therof is rather "pooh-poohed." Needless
to say, I'd like to try to change their minds for good.

Though I've been pretty good of late keeping up with reading news, anything
could change and I might not get back to read responses on the net, so
please post them here, but e-mail me also.

Thanks so much for the valuable pointers!

Ok, I've been reading the messages going back and forth for quite a while
here about what is the best definition for a virus. Well, here's one for
you all to look at...


     A computer virus is a sequence of instructions or symbols which,
   when executed or interpreted under certain conditions and in
   certain environments, will be capable of producing a functional
   offspring, with possible evolution and/or modification, which is
   also capable of replication and propogation, and will be capable
   of placing this offspring where it will have a possible chance of
   being executed and/or interpreted at a later time under the same
   or different conditions and/or environments. Viruses must also
   have been constructed/designed with the original intent (unless
   designed by something other than a human being) and functional
   capability to replicate and propogate within a certain environment
   and under certain conditions without the consent or knowledge of
   any user, beyond the initial release of the virus into said
   environment. A virus may also have additional functions or
   processes, but only the above functions and processes are
   necessary for something to be considered a virus.


Ok, now it's time for me to go run, duck, and
hide before I get hit with a barrage of scrutiny! :-)

             Another Virus Protection Program!

Recently contacted by a user with a number of Mitac PCs.  He reported
that if he ran VET on the PCs, after booting from the hard disk, it
reported top of memory was 9F80, & Stoned virus was active in memory,
but MBR was "unknown, but seems OK".  However if he booted from clean
DOS disk there was no sign of virus.

At first I thought he must have had a new strain, but then he
mentioned "Mitac Antivirus", so I got him to install VET, and send me
the reference disk, which has copies of both boot sectors.

The MBR was clearly highly non standard, with "ANTIVRUSSYS" at offset
4 and messages about this being invalid at the end.  The partition
information appeared to be intact (apart from one sector having been
reserved) and the sector was almost completely full of code.

The program appears to start by loading part of the directory, and
looking for the entry ANTIVRUS.SYS.  If it finds this it loads three
more sectors (presumably this file), starting at 8000. It checks that
each starts with a particular word before loading the next.

If it is happy it jumps to the start of the file.  Otherwise it loads
a sector from one past the last sector of the partition, writes it to
the MBR and warns "File C:\ANTIVRUS.SYS is invalid or not found!
Press a key!"  When the user replies it runs the rewritten sector.
Presumably this is a copy of the original MBR.

It is not clear whether the program ANTIVRUS.SYS includes a copy of
the MBR, or whether it loads it from the end of the partition.  What
is clear is that it does not bother to check it for viruses before
saving it, and that if it is installed on an infected PC it hides the
virus very effectively!

This is a common concern and the answer is that compressing a drive using
those compression mechanisms I have seen (Stacker, SuperStor) does not
pose a problem to virus scanners with two exceptions:

a) If the scanner uses Int 25 to examine the DOS Boot Record (not the MBR)
   it may pick up the special BR that the compression routine attaches to
   its "phantom" drive. If this occurs, a DBR virus such as the MusicBug
   could be missed (but a good scanner would find it in memory and booting
   from floppy without the compression driver would also).

b) If the scanner bypasses DOS (using direct BIOS reads) to defeat stealth
   viruses, this will not work on a compressed drive. I have only seen one
   scanner with this feature and you can turn it off - in operation it
   is obvious since it only reports a limited number of files.

Otherwise, scanners using DOS to open and examine the files will work just
fine since the drive redirection is handled below the DOS level.

Incidently, I regularly use disk compression on some of my PCs and it works
very well.

As long as you have the device driver(s) necessary to access the Stacker
compressed volume running on your PC you should have no problems checking
the volume for viruses.  This should apply to all anti-viral software,
not just VIRUSCAN.

You do not need to run VIRUSCAN until after you have unzipped the .ZIP
file.

>hard disk, and scan the unzipped files.  Will this still work on a

Yes.

You could set up a RAM disk and uncompress to that.  It is much faster
to scan a RAM disk then a floppy disk.

	Their is a hypertext program that is all about viruses. It
conyains a list of most of the known viruses, how to find them, how to
get rid of them, andit has a section of how all the diffrent virus
programs rate. As far as I know Macafee SCAN gets a score of 90% and
NAV gets a score of 65%, this is just from memory but you can find out
yourself by ftping vsumx###.zip ( the numbers are the most current
version I think it is 212 ) from most of the better ftp sites.

Subject: CMOS virus? (PC)

I wonder if a virus can erase the information stored in
CMOS?  If it can, what virus/viri known to work this way?
The reason I am asking these questions is that the computer
repair person we took our Grid system machine to claimed
that our problem (floppy drive wouldn't refresh) is caused
by a virus.  I don't know much about virus but the claim
sounds suspicious because he said that the virus is [stoned].

Thank you for any advice/information on this.

Subject: Worm wannabe - "WANK" (CVP)

HISVIRU.CVP   921215

                       Worm Wannabe - "WANK"

In October of 1989, another network worm was found to be making the
rounds -- on VMS machines connected through DECnet.  While even to
this day there is considerable debate as to Morris' intentions with
regard to the Internet Worm, for the "WANK Worm", as it is known,
there is no such ambiguity.  WANK was intended for propaganda, plain
and simple.

WANK used a number of features similar to those of the Internet
Worm.  Mail was used to spread the worm from system to system, and
"standard defaults" (in this case "system" and "field service"
accounts and passwords) were used to try to get the worm running on
a new machine.

In addition to guessing system passwords, the WANK worm also
attempted to change them.  As the program would have no further use
for them, once started, this would appear to have been directed at
inconveniencing the system operator.

The message carried by the worm spoke of "Worms Against Nuclear
Killers" and announced that the infected system had been "WANKed",
as well as displaying a "text graphic" of WANK.  It also contains
the quotation "You talk of times of peace for all, and then prepare
for war".  Obviously the author had believed the reports of the
Internet Worm which had spoken of massive numbers of military
computers being affected.  Ironically, few, if any, of the people
who saw the WANK worm's message would have had anything to do with
the military.

Some aspects of the worm were just plain obnoxious, such as
appearing to delete all of a user's files, and paging users with the
PHONE program.

A few weeks later, a second VMS/DECnet worm was released, with very
few changes from the original WANK.  This "knock-off of a knock-off
of a knock-off" tends be the more the rule than the exception in
virus research.  Of the thousands of MS-DOS viral programs, the vast
majority result from "bit twiddling" in an attempt (often less than
entirely successful) to fool scanners.  In the end it often means
nothing more than more, and more boring, work for the authors of
scanning programs.
