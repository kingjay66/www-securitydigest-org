Subject: Silly Season

With the onset of yet another school year, we are seeing another surge
in infections. The strange part is that the BIOS viruses are by far
leading the file infectors.

Meanwhile certain official types seem to have a new headache, the
SATAN-BUG.  Naturally, just to be contrary, this is a file infector.
However, like the 4096 which may have inspired the S-BUG author, it is
very easy to detect when resident as at least (haven't pulled it
completely apart yet) 3k is stolen from the TOM. Unlike the 4096
though the BIOS value is changed along with the MCB so memory checks
match but are low.

Like the 4096, the S-Bug's first target is COMMAND.COM so the first
sign of an infection might be an "invalid COMMAND.COM" warning that
will disappear on reboot. LANs which redirect the COMSPEC will also
crash infected machines unless the LAN copy also becomes infected. In
this case the virus will spread like wildfire (Note: good sanitary LAN
protection practices with read-only and execute-only rights rigorously
maintained will be safe).

Also similar to the 4096, Scanning with a scanner that does not
recognize S-Bug will serve to spread the infection everywhere. S-Bug
also uses multiple encryption like the WHALE (also a 4096 derivative)
but I do not expect that to be a major problem for the removal
programs.

Since 3k is stolen from the TOM, it is easily detectable with CHKDSK
or MEM or my FreeWare CHKMEM (mine allows use of errorlevels to detect
changes - part of FixUtil5.ZIP on many sites) using the same technique
I developed in 1988 to find the BRAIN. As a consequence, a 640k
machine will report 637k or less (652xxx or less instead of 655360
"total bytes memory" - Please see the FAQ.

Once detected, boot from a clean floppy and infected files will be
seen to have grown.

This points out my personal philosophy for the "safe" PC - Integrity
Management as the first line of defense to detect that "something" has
happened, then the professional tools such as scanners to determine
"what" happened.

:) let me guess. it says probably something like "I still make viruses
and you will soon see". prrobably references me in some way, such as
"I never talked to her" or, "Her interview was a lie, mostly".  (the
recreation of the dark avenger consists of several variants, depending
on whether he is the version attending college in u.s.a., the version
using the INFOTEL system to talk to people (at least that one is
bulgarian, even is he is only fifteen years old.  these variants have
been found in the wild).

one of the 'variants' sells viruses in the USA. this particular
variant told me he would be making a dark avenger to 'uncover' the
real dark avenger.  probably there is some reference to releasing a
virus by the end of the year, w hich correlates to a conversation i
had with one of the 'recreators' a month or so ago.  and, there would
be the obligatory reference to you as an idiot. how close am i?

>The 'virus underground' supposedly regard him as a 'hero', yet this
>behaviour seems to be a calculated insult.

there is a relatively focused effort of parts of the virus underground to
recreate the myth of the dark avenger. i discussed this briefly, when
i predicted this would happen during my "Publicly Available Help" session
at the (disastrous) Ides Conference. there are many populations that
would benefit from having <dav> release viruses, and since he isn't,
it's not too surprising that someone would feel the need to reconcoct him.

however, this is not extremely widespread. it seems to be focused around
certain virus writing groups and individuals. the majority of virus writers
(i.e., not distributors, but people who are just interested to write them to ex
plore how they
work) aren't interested in playing such games.

oh, i can send you the e-mail addresses of the various davs. perhaps
other people can contribute to this also. i have gotten mail from a
few who hav e received such mail, i'll ask them about sending it on to
you. i'm sure they won 't mind.

by the way, arent you the anthony naggs who wrote the paper on 'hows

   Much though I appreciate Anthony's skill and the Intel people's helpfulness,
   I am afraid that such a scheme is essentially "security by obscurity".
   Agreed, that the "boot block" probably does some very sophisticated
   authentication yet the details *must* be as simple to obtain as disassemblin
g
   the BIOS (and is probably in the near vicinity of the original jump).

True, malevolent code can still spoof the integrity checking but the
"boot block" still provides a known clean way to bring up a machine by
booting from a clean floppy.  This is about the best and only thing
you can do to search for and destroy malevolent code in the flash
parts of the BIOS or on disk.

Isn't that the point, not if the integrity checking can be fooled?

Subject: Anti-virus company distributing viruses ?

There is a rumour going around about some not-entirely-ethical practices
by a certain company in the anti-virus field.  It is possible the rumours
are totally unfounded, or they may be based on the actions of some
over-enthusiastic salesman, actiong without the permission or knowledge of
his superiors.

Anyhow, the story is as follows:

    This company is supposed to have created a collection of files, which
    contain viruses.  However, the viruses have been made "inactive",
    typically by overwriting the beginning of the files with garbage,
    such as "hjgsdhjfg", which makes the programs crash on execution.

    Those files are then given to potential customers, for "testing"
    purposes.

If this rumour is true, I have a serious problem with this.

First, they are spreading viruses - even if they cannot be executed directly,
somebody could extract them from the files.  I, and many other CARO members
have a firm policy of refusing to co-operate with companies that give viruses
to customers.

Second, the scanner produced by this company is able to find the virus code,
but many other products will not find anything, because of the way the
viruses have been modified.  I do not trust, and will not co-operate with
a company engaging in dishonest marketing practices.

Now, I do not know if this rumour is true, but if anybody can confirm this,
I (and others) would be very much interested in hearing about it.

FDISK /MBR has no effect on the FORM that I can think of.  FORM
is an operating-system-boot-record infector, not a master-boot
infector.  If a machine is FORM-infected before an FDISK /MBR,
it'll still be infected afterwards...

Loren infects all .COM and .EXE files opened for execution and all files
referenced by Int 21 fn 11 and 12, which are obsolete commands still used by
the DIR command.  Thus, if the virus is in memory, using DIR will infect all
COM and .EXE files opened.  The virus hides increases in file length when
active in memory.

The virus counts the number of files infected, and if the counter reaches 20
the warhead is triggered.  This tries to format cylinder 0, head 0 on
drive C.  If this fails, it tries drives A and B.  If it suceeds in
formatting any drive the following message is put to screen:

	Your disk is formatted by the LOREN virus.
	Written by Nguyen Huu Giap.
	Le Hong Phong School *** 8-3-1992

and the counter is reset.  A low level format will usually be needed to
recover affected hard disks.

CYBEC's VET anti-viral software detects and removes the Loren virus.

Not necessarily.  Because of the way Alan's FINDVIRU works, it is much more
sensitive to modified viruses than may other scanners, including my own F-PROT.
In partucular this means that if you modify the source code to a virus, and
re-assemble it, FINDVIRU may miss it as certain bytes are no longer located
at the offsets it expects.  F-PROT does not depend on location information,
that is, if the virus still contains the original search string, it will be
found, even if the search string is located at a different offset.

>I do not understand why you have performed your "mutation detection
>experiment",

Probably to test how likely a scanner is to detect a randomly modified virus...
after all, for every new virus written fgrom scratch, there are 2 or 3 that
are created by modifying older viruses.

No - you are confusing them with Command Software.  Command Software is
my US distributor of F-PROT Professional, and the producer of the NLM version

Bait files are on the same premise of tying a goat to a stake in the ground
in hopes that a predator will come by for a snack. When the predator comes to
eat the goatm the predator getstraped or killed.

Bait files are usually small do nothing programs for viruses to attach to..

I would rather have a virus attached to a 1-10 K bait file than have a
specimen attached to a 50 - 200K file in my collection. Besides since users
know exactly what is supposed to be in their bait files, it is much easier to
know where the virus is located, and easier to study.

Subject: Satan-Bug (PC)

This is not a particularly interesting virus however several elements have
expressed concern so some description is advisable.

The major problem is that while the virus is very easy to detect when resident
on a PC (my sample steals 9k from the Top of Memory - see the FAQ), the
polymorphic encryption makes it difficult to remove from a file once infected
(why good backups are always a good idea).

If you are concerned, my FreeWare CHKMEM (part of FixUtil5) will detect
it when resident even if you do not know how much memory a PC is supposed to
have so is usable as part of AUTOEXEC.BAT (since the virus goes after
COMMAND.COM first) or a LAN login script. It does not hide any better than
the 4096 did three years ago (and makes the same mistakes).

Further, normal LAN defenses will protect servers and prevent spread that
way, the virus does not use any special LAN-aware code for this.

The major problem is that anti-virus programs relying on validation code
attached to executable files may find it stripped off. Those that permit
execution without errors when this happens have only themselves to blame.

Finally, I have seen some unfounded rumors that the virus was directed
against government machines. This is not true. IMHO it is just another
sloppily written virus that is more annoying than most, is easy to detect,
and should not spread very far (unless it "gets lucky" 8*(

one MBR per hard drive, that is not part of any partition.

If you do not want to bother with these finer points, use the /HARD
parameter when invoking F-Prot; this tells the program to inspect the
whole hard disk (i.e. 1 MBR, and all partitions) for viruses.

Yes, your nearest Computer Shop: the product you need is marketed as
"MS-DOS 5.0" (or later versions). You may even have it already got :-)
See below for the detailed procedures.

Before you start you have to plan your action along the following lines:

1. With a reliable scanner, check all Computers you are in charge for.
   Remove the virus from their hard disks (see below). Make sure that
   no unchecked floppy disks are used in these computers (cf. step 3,
   below) -- if necessary even by locking the disk drives, or the
   keyboards, until you have completed the whole action.

2. Collect all floppy disks that were used in any computers found
   infected in step 1. It is essential that you really find all those
   disks, so hunt them down in all conceivable and inconceivable
   places: in cupbourds and drawers, in pockets and bags, don't over-
   look even those that are abused as rulers or saucers!

3. With a reliable scanner, check all disks collected in step 2. Take
   notes which ones are infected, and remove the virus from them (see
   below).

4. Find out on which computers the disks found infected in step 2 were
   used. Notify the people in charge for those computers and make them
   repeat the whole procedure (including the painful step 4!) for these
   computers.

5. Protect all computers you ar in charge for from re-infection.

Removal from hard disks:

As Stoned is an MBR infector that leaves the Partition Table in place,
you can use the FDISK command of MS-DOS 5.0 (and up) to write a new,
uninfected, MBR to the hard disk. I recommend the following procedure:

1. Switch off your computer (Cntrl-Alt-Del is *not* appropriate), then
   boot from a clean DOS 5.0 diskette. Deny any offer to install the
   system on the hard disk. Invoke any commands desired to make you
   feel comfortable, such as KEYB GR, or PROMPT $P$G.

2. Make sure the partition table is in place by
   FDISK /STATUS
   DIR C:
   DIR D:      ((if there is a D partition on the disk))

3. Only if step 2 proves undisturbed access to the hard disk, enter
   FDISK /MBR

4. Run your favourite virus scanner from the floppy disk to check the
   hard disk.

5. Switch off the computer, then boot from the hard disk.

This procedure uses only the hardware of the computer; hence it will work
regardless of the operating system you are normally using.

Removal from floppy disks:

On floppy disks, there is no MBR; Stoned uses the DOS-BR instead. There
are two commands in standard DOS to replace the DOS-BR:
- - SYS    (which works only for bootable disks, and requires the very
         DOS version that is on the disk),
- - FORMAT (which will erase all data that are on the disk).

You can use the following generic DOS procedure to remove Stoned (and
most MBR and DOS-BR infectors) from a couple of data disks:

0. Use a clean computer (see above), otherwise you will infect every
   disk you are trying to clean.

1. Format a supply of floppy disks.

2. Copy the data from an infected disk to a clean disk prepared in step
   1, using the XCOPY command, or equivalent. Check if copy is complete.
   Repeat for all disks.

3. FORMAT the infected disks, and use them for other purposes.

Good luck,

Hello...

Yesterday on the Netfind server at cs.colorado.edu I encountered a vt100
animation called BAMBI MEETS GODZILLA which played during the Netfind
output...today I encountered it again while fingering a calstate
account...both times the animation appeared during a Finger of
(netfind uses finger as part of it's operation) a calstate
account...has anyone ever heard of this beast?

Not only listed viruses, but dozens more do the same thing. The reason?
It's obvious: in order not to be interrupted while calling DOS functions.
Otherwise a user might (accidentally) stop the infection process by
pressing Ctrl-Break.

  I just got a copy of F-Prot 2.09f..  Since it has a file
called WHATSNEW.210 inside of it I'm wondering if it's a beta
version or such?  I don't want to distribute it if it is..
