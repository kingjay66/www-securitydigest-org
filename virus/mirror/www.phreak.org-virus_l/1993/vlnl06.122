He may have continued his virus experiments, but there is no evidence

Why would anyone want to catch him?  He hasn't broken any Bulgarian laws,
or done anything that another country might reasonably extradite him for.

Conclusion: like most student hackers, he has found more constructive
areas to continue his interest in computers.

Because of the analogy between computer and biological viruses the
word 'genetic' occasionally appears in discussions, but usually in
other contexts.

I can't see an immediate application for genetic algorithims by viruses
or anti-virus products, don't they require some kind of feedback by
the computer user?

Perhaps you would be kind enough to make some specific suggestions for
using them, for us to comment on?

Strange, have you any evidence for this?

The author of the Uruguay viruses is known.  So far as I'm aware he wrote
his viruses in Uruguay.

It is impossible to write a scanner that detects all possible 'droppers'.
For any single virus there is a near infinite number of possible droppers.

Would it be useful to have a scanner describe nearly every program on
your system like this:
    "Program not recognised, it might be a virus dropper!"  ?

I think not.

>From both a user and a-v developer point of view anticipating all possible
droppers with a scanner is not effective.  This is where defence program
such as an 'active monitor', is useful.  As a resident OS extension
it attempts to recognise 'virus like activity', such as editing program
files or altering boott sectors.

Of course this doesn't cover all situations, but if you can afford an
hour to examine each program file you are welcome to commission a program
from me to meet your needs.  :-)

You don't need a "virus" program to do this as the administrator can
force execution of analysis/anything programs each time a user logs in.

You've described a product which already exists.  N.S.O. - Network
Security Organizer, was designed to give system administrators
centralized control over workstation security.  It provides auditing of
all software AND hardware installed on the workstations, so apart from
being able to identify "bogus" programs you'll know straight away if RAM
or other hardware goes missing.  NSO's primary function is virus
detection and any program installed by the user is a potential virus.
NSO will audit all floppy disk accesses, making it possible to identify
the source of an "infection".  NSO installs anti-virus software like
Doctor, Scan or F-prot automatically onto each workstation as it logs
in, saving the administrator much legwork when upgrades are received.
It sounds like you'd appreciate the time savings.

You can download the software for evaluation from Leprechaun Software's
BBS on 404-971-8866.

As Mark Anbinder says, there are no viruses that affect both MS-DOS and
MAC systems.  In theory it is possible, but in view of the (relatively)
low number of viruses for the MAC it is unlikely that any virus author
has the skills to do so.

> And which ones should i be on the look out for on this new mixed platform??

Essentially your concerns are the same as for your existing networks:
1.  Prevent infected programs from being placed on servers, by using
    up to date MAC & MS-DOS scanners.
2.  Prevent programs on servers from being altered (infected), by setting
    Novell attributes to 'execute-only'.

You might also ensure anti-virus software is loaded on to workstations
in login scripts, (see Padgett Peterson's recent posting).

Sorry but this does not track. The STONED is a master boot sector infector
and there is only one MBR on a disk regardless of how many logical drives
it may contain. Remove it from that one sector, reboot, and the disk is clean.

(I am assuming from the above that there is only one physical disk in the PC)

Each logical partition does contain an Operating System Boot Record (also
a single sector) but the STONED virus does not infect these. I suspect that
either something is confused or you have an entirely different virus (F-Prot
is one of the best in avoiding mis-identification though).

Hmmm.  Cheyenne Software are agents for a commercial edition of Frisk's

phone number I have is a little different from the one in the letter,
(1 516 484 5110).

This is a rather unorthodox style.  I can't imagine courtesy in business
correspondence differs too much between the US & UK, and I would expect
the letter to start with an explanation of the software policing svheme
and an *invitation* to have your products included.

I strongly suggest you contact Cheyenne to determine if the letter is
genuine, and report your dissatisfaction.

This statement in particular seems to be flawed, as you only appear to
have used the FindVirus prgoram.  The Toolkit also include the ChkVirus
integrity checking program, which is specifically intended to detect
and warn of new viruses.

If Dr Solomon's Toolkit failed to detect your 'mutations' it seems
likely that you destroyed the ability of your viruses to replicate.
If they can't replicate they are not viruses, hence Toolkit is
correct in not reporting them.

Anybody 'testing' a-v products should ensure that they are actually
trying to detect genuinely replicating viruses.

I do not understand why you have performed your "mutation detection
experiment", but please ensure your 'viruses' are not distributed.
Preferably destroy them.  There are too many fools creating viruses
already!

I don't understand the insistance on a key switch, they add to the production

Why 'permanently write protected'?

If I was the manufacturer I would reserve the ability to distribute BIOS
images that can be used only a limited number of times, by altering an
installation count on the diskette.

What is your definition of a 'bad ROM update'?  To me the phrase conveys
a change of the ROM that fails in some way.  Yet your reference to 'backed

This all seems totally excessive.

I'm getting somewhat fed up with all the assertions about what
'manufacturers' do, without any primary evidence for specific brands or
products.  So I have just phoned Intel UK, and asked Andy Powell their
Product Marketing Manager about this.  Intel are the inventors of the
'Flash' variation of EAROM, (Electrically Alterable ROM), and the only
major manufacturer I know of currently supplying system with 'Flash BIOS'.
(Often branded by other manufacturers, eg Amstrad).

Trusting that my notes and understanding are accurate:

As documented here previously, Intel use Flash memories that include a
small 'boot block'.  Like the rest of the BIOS the boot block is
programmed at the factory, but it cannot be changed without physically
altering the system board, (eg by removing the Flash).

The boot block includes a 'minimum BIOS' supporting the diskette drives
and allowing the Flash update process to operate.  At system startup
the processor first executes code in the boot block, which performs
multiple checksums to authenticate the majority of the BIOS before
passing control.

Changing the BIOS is done by booting from the "Flash Update Utility"
diskette that includes the new BIOS.  The boot block BIOS checks
that the new BIOS is for the correct PC model & configuration of
equipment, before releasing the interlocks that prevent programming
of the Flash.

If the boot block BIOS detects an error in the Flash BIOS at boot up,
due to deliberate tampering or failure to complete a BIOS update,
it will prevent normal use of the system.  The only remedy being to
correctly complete installation with the "Flash Update Utility".

The exact details of the authentication procedures are Intel trade
secrets.  It certainly appears that Intel PCs using Flash BIOS are
no more vulnerable to malicious alteration than other PCs whose ROMs
can be removed from sockets and replaced.

Point of order: :-)  The technician you spoke with was unsure of the answer
and brought a copy of your message to me--I assumed that you meant viruses
which directly attack McAfee Associates' software and told him to answer
"no" to your question.  Your subsequent reply listed a few, including (at
least) one I have not heard of before called the "Lokjaw-zwie" which claims
to delete McAfee Associates' VIRUSCAN (SCAN.EXE).

Naturally, we'd be very interested in seeing a copy of this particular
virus, or if you don't actually have one, perhaps you could send us a
copy of the description or report you received of it?  Thanks!

Possibly, but there is an alternate explanation.  Many virus scanners
(eg McAfee's Scan) look for 'scan strings'.  These are small segments
of a virus that the a-v producer believes are unlikely to appear in
uninfected files.  Windows resource files and compressed executables
(eg with PKLite), include many byte sequences which are rare in ordinary
programs.  Scanning them with this method can therefore produce
false alarms.

Only a few viruses will actually infect Windows resource files.
The two most common methods for a virus to select new files to
infect are:
1.  Look for files with a .COM or .EXE extension, perhaps with a search
    or by watching for file accesses.
2.  Watch for programs being loaded for execution, with function $4B.
    With Windows this only happens in the DOS boxes.

>  If it happens, is it important (i.e. are

Fonts, and other resource files for Windows, use information in the
extended ('new') EXE header to decide what facilities to allocate
(eg memory).

A Windows 'aware' virus could add an executable copy to such files.
While Windows would probably run it if attached to a DLL, or device
driver I doubt it will do so for a Font file.

If an MS-DOS virus attempted to infect it (eg a member of the Jerusalem
family) the file would probably be corrupted, and Windows would refuse
to load it.

There are several possibilities:
1.  There are 'dropper' programs, which carry a virus and place in a PC.
    Bypassing the normal infection method, but allowing to infect in the
    future.
2.  'booting from a floppy' includes just running the boot program on
    the floppy, that says "Non-system disk.  Any key to continue".
    The virus in the boot sector has not only loaded into the PC, and
    then loaded the original boot program, but in the case of Stoned
    and Michelangelo it has already infected the hard drive!
    Preventation is either by ensuring drive A: is empty before booting
    your PC, or (if available) select a BIOS setting that only boots
    from your hard drive.

I haven't tested InnocuLAN from Cheyenne. But from all appearances it seems
legitimate as well as a complete A-V package. meaning it contains a scanner
as well as generic detection routines.

You perhaps did try to unzip with old version of the pkunzip? The more
recent pkz204-package has a new version of the pkunzip, too. Actually
I think the name of the package should be pkz204g.exe for the
self-extracting package.
You should not try to run incompletely unzipped .exe's, you never can
know what happens.

For virus detection use some decent program like viruscan or fprot.

Subject: Ethernet node addresses

[Moderator's note: This is quite far off the topic of viruses, so
please send any follow-ups via e-mail to the authors.]

In a side question in a recent VIRUS-L message, Padgett Peterson wondered
where the Ethernet addresses used by various vendors come from.

What information I have comes from RFC 1060, the "assigned numbers" RFC.  It's
rather old (March 1990) but the basic information is probably still correct.

Assignment of Ethernet is addresses is done by the IEEE.  An Ethernet station
address is 12 hex digits long.  The 6 leading digits (in the standard rep-
resentation) are assigned by IEEE; the assignee fills in the six trailing
digits.  One of the leading digits has a reserved bit; it is 0 for a station
address, 1 for a multicast address.  The writers of the RFC didn't know if
the assignment of a block of numbers included both the station and multicast
numbers with a common leading 23 bits.  (Based on actual usage, this is
PROBABLY the case.)  It was also unclear to the writers how the upper 6 digits
were chosen.  There were hints that some number of the bits were deliberately
randomized, while others were allocated sequentially.  It may also be the case
that globally unique vs. locally unique numbers, and physically assigned vs.
software assigned numbers, were supposed to be allocated in distinct ranges.
If this is so, it hasn't been done consistently.

I don't know the mechanics of applying to IEEE for a range of addresses, but I
assume they are similar to those of applying to Xerox for an Ethernet protocol
number:  You tell them how many numbers you need, suggesting some particular
ones if you care; they reserve something for you and send you back a nice
letter telling you what you got.  Xerox, when I dealt with them a couple of
years back, charged soemthing like $250/request; a request could be for any
"reasonable" number of protocol numbers.  (Ethernet protocol numbers are only
16 bits long, so there's a limited supply; on the other hand, there was never
all that much demand, and these days people use IEEE-format SNAP SAP's, which
do the same thing with a 6-byte range of values.)

Obviously, Xerox knows what all the reserved numbers are.  However, they won't
necessarily tell you:  Publication is up to the "owner" of the number.  Xerox
sends you a form asking for permission to give out your name.  I've never seen
an actual Xerox listing of protocol numbers; I assume the "private" ones show
up as simply "reserved".  I would guess that IEEE does something similar; but,
again, I've never seen an "official" list.

One list I've got was being maintained (a couple of years ago) by someone at
cyrus@pprg.unm.edu.  Whether anyone there is still keeping the list going, I
have no idea.
