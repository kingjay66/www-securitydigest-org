The VIS Utilities written by Jim Bates has included just such a form
as an acsii text file for sometime now. The docs for the program also
highlight the issues you have raised.

Yes, it would be very helpful. There is only one problem though:
Scotland Yard's Computer Crime Unit is heavily understaffed (last I
heard, they were only 5 people !), and heavily overworked already.
They have to collect much of the evidence to be brought forward in the
future trials of hackers that will take place soon. Because you have
to remember that they not only deal with Viruses, but also with any
other malicious use of computers.

If they had E-mail, can you imagine the flood of messages they'd get
per day ? I think that they will first have to expand before
considering having a connection to the net. If they advertised in
magazines, can you imagine the flood of calls they'd get. ( I'm told
that their lines seem to be always engaged anyway already...)

In short: they'll have to expand before offering such services.
Unfortunately, a lot of people that decide where the money is spent
believe that this computer crime is all too new, and that they have
time to implement something later. The idea is great, but the money
just isn't there.

I like this explanation!  Your colleague must not subscribe to Hobbs.
There are some viruses that directly attack Unix system, however I
wouldn't worry about them.  They are still rare in the wild.  If you
use a Unix system that can execute MSDOS programs or you are using
the Liken Mac emulator then you may want to take precautions against
these types.

Subject: Parity Check Virus outbreak (PC)

Dear researchers and non-researchers !

Last week I detected a new virus at our university. Several PC's
dedicated for student's use were infected. To my knowledge no damage
besid beside the usual time costs occured. Scan V 104 detected the
virus as Part B, f-prot 2.08 as Parity Check virus.  Clean was able to
remove the virus (as I'm not a member of the staff, the choose of
reaction wasn't within my competence, I'd prefer just FDISK /MBR).
The old fashioned 3-byte check was the clue of the detection, CHKDSK
with a resulting mem size lower than 655360 , and I already got
suspicious (Yes, I know that many BIOS's allow an extra stack space or
so at TOM, but who uses this feature ? ). the pure blue machines are
rare at our site, they

Technical details:
Parity is an BSI, it infects MBR's and floppies. infection occurs when
an unif uninfected Boot record is read, if I disassembled correctly on
all accessed disks (also 2nd drives). the keyboard int is also
trapped, via a random byte the computer may be halted, with 'PARITY
CHECK' in 40*25 b/w on the screen.  A warmboot is also simulated by
the virus, remaining resident. An attempt to read the MBR is trapped
and the original MBR is returned.

The only thing remarkable is the way it goes TSR, it just uses 5
commands, then forcing a reboot (get int 13h / int 09h, dec mem, copy
to TOM, set int 13h, reboot calling int 19h). The trapped int 13h then
redirects the read of the infected MBR to the original one, and the
system comes up.

Hello world !

A friend of mine got the offer to act as distributor in Austria for a
antivirus solution implemented in hardware. It is called Exvira , is
developed and produced in the former German Democratic Republic, now
part of Federal Germany. As far as I've read about this card, it traps
the write line of the HD-controller cable , keeps the names of the
protected files stored in its own memory and alarms the user if a
write attempt is made to them. It also stores the MBR / BR and
prevents any change of them. Disks and files can only be copied using
a special copy service (right after booting), trying to prevent slow
infectors, too. The only hole in the protection I can right now
imagine are companion and path companion viruses, and maybe
FAT-infectors like Dir II (please no flames 'bout that, I know that it
doesn't infect the FAT itself ...).  I can imagine that the restriced
copying may be a major inconvenience, but exce pt this :

Has anybody already used or tested this antivirus card ?
Are there any other obvious security holes ?

Please feel free to answer, via e-mail or the discussion list.
                                                Regards, Martin

Subject: missed samples in F-Prot 2.08 (PC)

Hello Community !

As the older versions of fprot, the latest one still misses 2 samples
of my not-very-big collection of samples . The important thing is , it
misses them when used in Secure mode, in Quick mode it detects them,
and in Heuristic mode it yells 'A new unknown virus seesm to be found,
please inform ...'. The 1st skipped sample is WWT-01 an 'old'
overwriting tiny virus , just about 67 byte long. The other one is a
newer one, an Enemy / Screaming Fist variant called Stranger (
containig the text 'I'm a stranger in a strange land'). Quick scan
detects it as Enemy, as the other files infected with the same virus.
But among these are a few windows files, not only infected but
damaged, and these are detected in Quick mode (as Enemy) and not at
all in Secure mode. Maybe Frisk uses the filesize from the EXE-header
to compute the posotion to scan, and because all windows files seem to
contain a to small value as size, the virus overwrites the file and
leaves the windows part unusable. I detected this bug in fprot about a
year ago, have already mentioned it several times to Frisk via e-mail,
but he seems to busy to answer or correct the bug.  So I watched a few
versions of fprot come and go, and now I decided to report to Virus-L
, hoping Frisk or one of his programmers reads this discussion list
more frequently than his own reader files ;).

Basically, I want to know where I can find the newest virus
definitions for Norton Antivirus.  I used to get them from Compuserve,
but it costs too much.

Thanks!

Subject: MSDOS 6 Vsafe False Reports (PC)

I have a friend who installed MSDOS 6.0 on his computer and we ended
up with Vsafe giving SCAN 104 false virus detection in the top of 1MB
memory.  When we changed the options in VSafe the virus type changed
as well.  Interesting.... The virus was reported in the 1088 KB region
of memory.

Unfortunately we thought we may have had a partition virus and
Formatted Drive C: . Only later did we realise that the software was
at fault.

My question is has anybody else encountered this problem yet. I am
relatively new to NN and so far have not seen any reports of it...
Maybe you've already covered this ground. In any case could someone
please fill me in.

Thanx

Subject: Reading the volume serial number from a disk (PC)

Does anybody know of a dos call that returns the volume serial number from
a floppy or hard disk?  Or has another way to do it?

Since my program will be written in VBasic, calling INT 25 appears to be out;
the stack is garbled.  INT 13 seems to be the only way, but calculating the
correct numbers seems rather hard.  Can anyone help?

Thanks!

Subject: f-prot updates (PC)

Hello,

As I don't have the time to test and use more then virus scanner, I
decided (after reading this group) to use f-prot. I grabbed the newest
(I think) version 208a. But now I have a problem. Every time I start
f-prot or virstop I get the message the the program and the sign.def
(?) file are old versions. They are dated May 15th, I believe.

How does f-prot decide if it is an old version ? Shall I just use the
/OLD switch on the programs ? Is there an update to 208a yet ? Are the
updates to the sign.def announced in comp.virus ?

I have read the FAQ but couldn't find an answer to my problems.
