It's a stealth polymorphic EXE and COM fast infector. It is not
intentionally destructive; its payload is a video effect.

Yes. In the Upper memory, more exactly.

For instance, FindVirus 6.34 from Dr. Solomon's Anti-Virus ToolKit is
able to disinfect Tremor, but since it does not detect reliably all
infected files, I won't recommend it. Also, CPAV 2.0 and above claims
to be able to disinfect Tremor, but can do this correctly only with
COM files.

However, with Tremor you don't actually need a disinfector. Just
execute one of the infected files to make sure that the virus is
active in memory and then copy all infected files on floppies. (Use
the COPY command and don't run any other programs like file managers,
because they will become infected.) Then boot from an uninfected write
protected system diskette, delete all infected files and replace them
with the files you just copied on a floppy. That's all.

The above procedure works because of a design bug in the stealth
mechanism used by the virus. It disinfects "on-the-fly" the files that
you copy, but fails to re-infect them.

> I hope there are other possibilities than reinstalling the system.

Of course.

Subject: F-PROT 2.09F - a clarification (PC)

There has been some confusion created by a version of F-PROT that is
available.  This is version 2.09F, but one text file inside it is
named NEW.210, leading some people to suspect that this might be a
hacked version.  It is not - this is a perfectly valid version, but
the reason it was called 2.09f instead of 2.10 is that some major
changes are planned for 2.10, but they are behind schedule.  In order
to keep F-PROT users up-to-date with respect to virus detection, we
released this version.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.09f - the following problems were found and corrected:

   When running under OS/2 2.1, version 2.09 and earlier did not recognize
   HPFS file systems, and just reported "Error reading C:", unless boot
   sector scanning was disabled, which unfortunately meant that the
   MBR was not scanned either.

   2.09 was unable to disinfect certain boot sector viruses, such as
   Stoned.NoInt from hard disks, and would simply report "Original MBR
   not found".

   False "Ultimatum" positives were fixed.

Version 2.09f - minor improvements and changes:

   The /TROJAN and /NOTROJAN switches have been eliminated, as searching
   for Trojans does not require any significant extra processing, as it
   used to.  F-PROT will now always search for the Trojans it recognizes
   and report them if found.

   F-PROT now reports which program have been modified by adding the
   Central Point/Turbo Anti-Virus self-check code.  We do not recommend
   adding external integrity checking code to programs, as many programs
   perform their own interlnal self-intecrity check, and will consider the
   added code a virus infection.

Version 2.09f - new viruses:

   The following 21 viruses are now identified, but can not be removed as
   they overwrite or destroy infected files.  Some of them were detected by
   earlier versions of F-PROT, but only reported as "New or modified
   variant of..."

	Australian Parasite.143
        Burger (498, 505, 505.B, 505.C, 505.D, 505.E, 505.F, 509 and 560.K2)

Subject: Netware Supervisor Audit Trails? (PC)

Hi,

Can anyone tell me if there is any way to get an audit trail of supervisor
activities on a Netware server. I know that this facility is NOT built
into Netware.

The information we would want to capture, apart from activity, would be:

1: Node logged in as supervisor from.

2: Real id before login as supervisor (if possible)

I expect that there maybe third party utilities that can do this, but to
date I haven't been able to track them down. Any help would be gratefully
recieved.

Many thanks, in advance.

Well, all documents that I have produced -are- available in pure ASCII
form. This includes the paper in question, as is obvious BTW from the
message you quoted. The reason that there is -also- a TeX version is
that I had to produce a "pretty looking" copy for the proceedings of a
conference, so I decided to make this version available too. Now I
also added a PostScript version, because somebody requested it. But I
don't intend to remove the pure-ASCII version, don't worry.

This should probably go in the FAQ. Remember:

THERE AIN'T NO SUCH THING AS THE GENERIC BOOT VIRUS.

This is a heuristic used by SCAN. It reports this when it finds in the
boot sector a particular wildcard scan string which can often be found
in boot sector viruses. What it means is:

"This boot sector looks sure looks suspicious and I'd bet that it is
infected, but I don't have the slightest idea which virus it might
be."

Repeat, THIS IS NOT THE NAME OF ANY PARTICULAR VIRUS. In particular,
SCAN calls like that dozens of different viruses from my collection.
I'll try to post their full list soon.

Do they? Then they should say that it might. Indeed, "clean disk:
[genb]" usually works - but by no means always and it is trivial to
design a virus which it will not be able to remove (or will even
trash the disk while trying to remove the virus).

> Any more info available ?

The simplest way to remove the virus in your case is to do SYS on the
infected floppy.

                            COMPARATIVE REVIEW


                        TSR:  PANACEA OR SNAKE OIL?


These results form the first comparative review of memory resident
anti-virus software ever undertaken by Virus Bulletin.  The test protocol
measures the simplest functionality which the TSRs claim to provide:
detection of infected files as they are copied.  The results may come as
an unpleasant surprise for IT Managers who have been relying on TSRs to
protect machines in their domain.

MC AFEE ASSOCIATES' VSHIELD
___________________________

VSHIELD is the memory-resident offering from McAfee Associates.  Not only
does VSHIELD claim to be able to detect known viruses, but the developer
has included the option to perform integrity checks on executable files.

Installation of VSHIELD proved to be simply a matter of copying the
program onto the hard drive and adding a short line to the end of
AUTOEXEC.BAT.  For users wishing to protect workstations, a program named
CHKSHLD is provided, which can be used to deny access to a network if the
workstation is not running VSHIELD.  This is done by reconfiguring the
Novell Login Script, and the documentation provides a number of sample
configuration files and examples of the correct command line options.

Like most of the other products reviewed, VSHIELD can be configured to use
different amounts of memory.  On the test machine, it took 41.6 Kbytes
when loaded normally, 3.7 Kbytes when swapped to disk and 6.7Kbytes when
it was integrity checking only.

VSHIELD can be configured to provide four levels of protection.  Level I
is provided by the separate program VSHIELD1, which only checks the
validation codes added by McAfee Associates flagship product SCAN.
Programs which fail the validation checks are not allowed to execute.
Level II protection checks for known viruses at runtime, and a plethora of
command line options exist to allow the user to configure this mode of
operation.  Level III protection provides a combination of the techniques
applied in Levels I and II.  Finally, Level IV protection allows the IT
Manager to specify which programs can and cannot be executed.

The performance of SCAN was very good, gaining a creditable 78/83 against
test-set one, and 242/250 against test-set two.  The results of VSHIELD
were not anything like as encouraging, and rather set the tone for the
other reviewed products.  VSHIELD missed 15 viruses from test-set one
(from these 15 viruses, SCAN identified 10 as infected) and a staggering
53 viruses from test- set two (of which SCAN could detect 45).  The
documentation supplied with VSHIELD positively implies that it is capable
of detecting all these viruses - clearly something is amiss.

These results beg the question of why so many samples were missed.  Is it
a case of poor quality control or does VSHIELD simply not look for these
viruses?  McAfee Associates was asked to comment on these results but has
not done so - maybe it will feel more inclined to reply to its customers.

DR. SOLOMON'S AVTK GUARD
________________________

VirusGuard forms part of Dr. Solomon's AVTK, and is designed "to monitor
files for viruses and prevent infected programs from being run or copied".

Installation of the program is easy, as it can be done as part of the
Toolkit's installation routine.  The appropriate changes are made to
AUTOEXEC.BAT and once the machine is rebooted it is protected by GUARD.
The documentation provided with the product is good, and gives a clear
no-nonsense explanation of exactly what the program is intended to do, and
which files and extensions are checked.

GUARD automatically attempts to load itself into enhanced memory, first
trying XMS, and if this is unavailable, EMS.  If neither XMS or EMS is
available it defaults to accessing the virus signatures required from
disk.  These options all have command line overrides built in, so if there
is a reason that the user wishes to use EMS instead of XMS the program can
be configured accordingly.  GUARD can be loaded either as a device driver
or a TSR component.

VirusGuard protects against file viruses, both when infected files are
executed or copied.  When GUARD finds a virus, a red box is displayed on
the screen, and the PC speak emits a buzz.  The message displayed when a
virus is detected (and indeed most of the other features within GUARD) can
be configured easily using command line options.

The detection results of FindVirus, the scanner part of the Toolkit,
performed well, missing only 1 virus (Tremor) from test- set one, and 3
viruses out of the 250 in test-set 2.  The results from GUARD were less
impressive:  four viruses slipped through from test-set 1 (Todor, Tremor,
V2P6 and WinVir14) of which FindVirus was capable of detecting all except
for Tremor.  The same story was true of test-set 2, where GUARD missed 7
infected files, of which FindVirus could detect 4.

These results show that GUARD is incapable of detecting certain
polymorphic viruses, and S&S was asked to comment on this.  Note that the
documentation describing VirusGuard states that "When VirusGuard is
installed, it will sit in the background, checking for ** all known
viruses**..." (VB's emphasis. Ed.)

Iolo Davidson from S&S explained that there were a few exceptions to this
rule.  The reason for these omissions was that "the routines take up a lot
of memory-resident space".  Dr. Solomon later added that he was
"flabbergasted" that the manual did not explain this clearly, and that
this situation would be rectified.  Such changes to the manual would be a
welcome addition to GUARD, which is basically a good utility.  However,
Davidson warned that it should not be relied on, as "it's not the be-all
and end-all of virus detection - it's really there just to prevent
accidents."

MICROSOFT'S MSAV
________________

The anti-virus component supplied with MS-DOS 6 is a subset of Central
Point's popular anti-virus product CPAV.  Just like CPAV, MSAV contains
its own memory-resident scanner, VSafe.

According to the documentation (of which a scant 17 pages describes all
the components of MSAV), VSafe is "a memory- resident program that
monitors your computer and warns of changes that might have been caused by
a virus".  This is never really explained further in the manual, but from
examining the options within VSafe, it appears to be a combined behaviour
blocker and memory-resident scanner.

VSafe can either be configured from the command line or, once
memory-resident, by popping up a configuration box using a "hot- key".
This allows the product to be operated easily and simply.

Once memory-resident, VSafe takes up 23K of conventional memory and 23K of
XMS, making it one of the more memory-hungry programs reviewed.

The performance of the MSAV package was disappointing.  The scanner was
only capable of detecting 67 of the 83 viruses in test-set number 1 - this
went down to 162 out of 250 in the second test-set.  However, the results
obtained by VSafe provided more cause for concern.  From the first
test-set, 27 files were missed (of which MSAV could detect 11), and
against the second, 104 viruses slipped through, 28 of which were
detectable by MSAV.  A fairly dismal result.

CENTRAL POINT'S CPAV 2.0
________________________

CPAV 2.0's memory-resident scanner, VSafe, claims to be "a comprehensive
memory-resident, virus protection utility, that provides real time
monitoring".  The product is easily configured and offers such added
extras as an audit trail and the ability to communicate with its big
brother, CPAV for NetWare, allowing centralised virus protection.

The documentation supplied with VSafe is clear and easy to read, but is
unfortunately let down rather by its index.  Its style is rather
irritating to the seasoned anti-virus reviewer, but for users who lack
specialist knowledge on the subject, the over- simplified way in which the
problems are tackled will almost certainly be a benefit.  The installation
instructions are easy to follow, and allows users to configure the system
to suit the system they are using.

The memory-resident part of CPAV comes in two different guises.  VSafe,
which can be loaded either as an EXE file or a device driver and VWatch.
The difference between the two programs is that VWatch is a virus specific
program, whereas VSafe can also use the checksum information generated by
CPAV to check for changes to executable files.

In terms of detection, CPAV 2.0 (using the latest available signature
update files) did little better than MSAV.  The scanner detected 74 of the
83 virus from test-set one, and a disappointing 184 out of 250 from
test-set two.

As has been the case with all the other products tested, the
memory-resident utility VSafe missed viruses detected by the scanner.  In
this case VSafe missed 18 viruses from test-set one, nine of which were
detected by CPAV, and 68 from test-set two.  Only seven of the test-set
two viruses missed by VSafe were detected by CPAV, but five viruses
detected by VSafe were not detected by CPAV.  Central Point explains these
puzzling results by the fact that the TSR component uses a slightly
different method of searching for viruses.

This niggle aside, VSafe is clearly not detecting all of the same viruses
as CPAV, though Central Point claims that any viruses missed by the
virus-specific parts of VSafe will be detected by the generic virus
detection included.  Again, this policy is not made clear anywhere in the
manual, and this omission should be rectified.

RG SOFTWARE'S VI-SPY
____________________

Vi-Spy is the anti-virus offering from the American company RG Software.
It comprises of a virus scanner and integrity checker, and a
memory-resident scanner, RVS, in addition to several utilities to help
clean up a virus attack.

RVS makes some pretty tall claims as to its functionality: it was stated
that RVS would detect viruses no matter how they were written to the disk,
including COPY, XCOPY and from within Windows.  Pretty tall claims; could
RVS live up to them?

The documentation provided with Vi-Spy is brief and to the point,
consisting of a "Computer Virus Primer and Troubleshooting Guide" and a
short 45-page user manual.  The action of RVS is explained in a
non-technical manner, and then a list of command line options is provided,
so that the user can configure the system to suit his needs.

Installation of RVS was easy: the installation program took care of the
necessary changes to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, after asking the user if he
wished to install the memory-resident software.

RVS can be run in several different modes.  If upper memory is available,
it takes just 19K of upper memory and 60K of Expanded memory.  If no
expanded memory is available, the user has the choice of using 79K of
memory or swapping parts of RVS to disk, saving 60K, although the penalty
for this is a loss of performance.

The test results for Vi-Spy and RVS are by far the best in this
comparative review: in fact, RVS was the only TSR virus protection which
detected all the viruses detected by the main scanner included with the
package.

When tested against test-set one, both RVS and Vi-Spy missed three
infected files, one sample of the Loren virus and two infections of
Necros.  The results against test-set two were even more impressive: both
RVS and Vi-Spy gained a perfect score of 250/250.  These results show that
it is possible to write a memory-resident scanner which is capable of
detecting the more complex polymorphic viruses.  Thoroughly recommended.

FRISK SOFTWARE'S F-PROT
_______________________

The memory-resident portion of F-Prot, VIRSTOP, is the only product on
test which makes it clear in its documentation that it makes no attempt to
detect polymorphic viruses.  In paragraph four of the VIRSTOP
documentation, the warning is made quite clear: "IMPORTANT!...VIRSTOP does
not detect the same number of viruses as F-PROT.  In particular, VIRSTOP
does not detect most polymorphic viruses.  It is therefore recommended
that VIRSTOP only be used as one component of the virus protection - do
not rely on it alone".

The remainder of the documentation goes on to describe the different
command line switches which VIRSTOP recognises.  These are very simple,
and allow the user to configure the behaviour of the software (such as
which files are scanned and when) without unnecessary complexity.

When memory-resident, VIRSTOP takes up 16Kbytes of memory, although it can
be loaded high, either as a device driver or from AUTOEXEC.BAT.  Like all
the other products, if memory is a particularly scarce commodity, its
virus signatures can be swapped out to disk, saving 12.4 Kbytes.  Again,
this leads to a large drop in performance.

The performance of VIRSTOP was slightly disappointing (although better
than McAfee Associates, who did not even include a caveat about
polymorphic viruses).  The scanning part of F-Prot missed three viruses
from test-set one (an EXEBUG2 dropper and two infections of the Loren
virus), and gained a near perfect 249/250 and one "suspicious" file when
run against test-set two.

VIRSTOP, on the other hand, missed 14 files from test-set one (of which
F-Prot detected 11) and 39 files from test-set two (of which F-Prot
detected 38 as infected and one as suspicious).  Given that the user is
warned from the outset of what the software is designed to accomplish,
this is fair.


SYSTEM LOAD
___________

The performance overheads added by the different products varied widely.
In order to gain some measure of the impact a user could expect on his
system, the time taken to copy 49 clean executable files from a floppy
diskette to the hard drive was measured with each of the memory-resident
programs monitoring copied files.  The results obtained from this test are

The overhead added by MSAV, combined with its poor detection results, make
its results completely unacceptable, with CPAV 2.0 and McAfee faring
little better.  The load added by Dr. Solomon's AVTK and Vi-Spy is far
more reasonable, but it could become rather restrictive.  Note that not
only was Vi-Spy the most accurate memory-resident program, but it was the
second fastest.  Surely its competitors have something to learn from these
results?


CONCLUSIONS
___________

The poor performance of all the memory-resident scanners came as something
of a shock when conducting this review.  With the exception of Vi-Spy, in
every single case, the memory-resident scanners were incapable of
detecting viruses which were clearly known to the product developers, most
of whom did not point this out in their manuals.

Vi-Spy is the only product to come through this test unscathed, and is
thoroughly recommended.  As for the other products, it seems that the
inference of "detects all viruses" has slipped in accidentally to the
manufacturers documentation - it is to be hoped that these test results
will be reminder enough for this to be corrected.


Figure 1: Detection results for the virus scanner and memory- resident
components within the virus packages.  Only two products perform as
advertised, F-Prot and Vi-Spy.  Note that with the exception of Vi-Spy,
every memory-resident scanner performs worse than the main scanner in the
product.  Users should be warned of this in the documentation.

Technical Details:

Tests were carried out on an Opus Technologies 386SX 25Mhz, with 4MB RAM,
a high-density 3.5 inch drive, a high-density 5.25 inch drive and an 80
Mbyte hard drive.  Timing tests were taken by measuring the time taken to
copy 49 files (comprising 1.37 Mbytes) from the floppy drive to the hard
drive.

The viruses used in the test-sets were all genuine infections of parasitic
file viruses.  Test-set one was drawn from a subset of the Virus Bulletin
"In the wild" test-set.  Test-set two was made up of 250 different file
infecting viruses drawn randomly from the Virus Bulletin collection.
