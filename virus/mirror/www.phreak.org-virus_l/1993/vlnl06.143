    To quote Mark Ludwig, we can use computer viruses to do research
about artificial life. In fact, I know at least one person in a
biology department in an argentinian unversity doing that. I think the
new version of the project, which creates the posibility of being
registered to be an (anti) virus researcher, is much better, and
allows people even to write or distribute virus in a responsible way.
I think we can't stop investigation about explosives only because
explosives are very dangerous.

    That's what we must care, if the law is too restrictive it can
even make A-V investigation illegal... I't would be funny if all
anti-virus researchers have to go underground, it wolud be no
difference between an anti virus researcher and a virus author... Not
to mention we should find another work :-)

    Ok, but a virus author may argue he wrote his virus only for
investigation purposes, and it escaped... So "intent" isn't enough...

Subject: In search of horror stories

I'm in the process of writing a new security/virus book (to be
released at VSI '94).  I wish my treatment of potentially explosive
issues to be fair and balanced.  At the same time, this book should
stir up just a little bit of excitement.

The explosive issue _du jour_ is the case for and/or against scanning
technology and scanning mentality.  Since my own opinion is,
admittedly, somewhat biased I would like to solicit thoughts and
opinions from participants on VIRUS-L.  If you have published on the
subject, I would appreciate a copy of your paper/article.

I am aware that the subject has been debated before but things change
rapidly ...  new techniques are constantly being developed on both
sides of the fence ...  virus writers and anti-virus product
developers.  I'm interested in the current thinking, current
challenges, current pluses and minuses.

Next, the case for or against generic A-V protection AND the case for or
against A-V software that cleans up infections.

I am also interested, with particularity, in the following:

1.  Examples of false alarms against clean code.

2.  Examples of false alarms due to faulty A-V programming.

3.  Examples of A-V programs missing relatively well-known viruses,
either for lack of inclusion of the virus ID string or faulty
programming techniques.

4.  Examples of anything else that needs to see the light of day or is
the subject of serious controversy.  (Not to put too fine a point on it,
I'm looking for Occasions of Sin.  E-mail is fine for touchy stuff that
might result in threatened libel suits.)

I will not attribute remarks or quote directly for attribution without
consent.  Significant contributors will, of course, be mentioned in the
acknowledgements.

Great.
I said, "(usually)" because I remember looking over a few that

There are many good and rational reasons for executing DOS on a PC that
normally executes Unix.  Leave an infected DOS floppy in the drive during
system reset and a boot virus will overwrite that portion of the disk where
it expected the DOS boot record to be stored.  The effect on a Unix system
varies from none observed to a damaged filesystem.

Subject: New virus - Int_10 (PC)

			     New MBR virus - Int_10

        Recently  a  new virus was discovered in Canada that  shows  some
        disturbing advances in "stealth".

        It does not appear to be deliberately malicious (its "payload" is
        a  graphic  snowfall  on  the screen at  midnight  or  six  hours
        following boot in December) but could cause disk corruption.

        A floppy boot sector and  hard disk MBR infector, the virus seems
        specifically  directed at "generic"/"heuristic" scanners  and  my
        early stuff.

        This  virus goes resident in 1k at the TOM and  actually  removes
        itself from the fixed disk during boot replacing the original MBR
        into sector one to  avoid  detection.  While  it eventually hooks
        interrupt   13h,  this  is  not  during  the  BIOS  load,   being
        accomplished through DOS instead.

        Once fully resident, "stealth" is used to hide the return of  the
        virus to the MBR.

        While  two varients have been found so far, both may be  detected
        via  the following string in the MBR (if booted from  floppy),  a
        floppy DBR, or in the last 1k area at the TOM if resident in RAM;

                  88 85 93 02 41 41 D3 E0 80 7D 0B 00 75

        At the moment this virus which has been tentatively named  INT_10
        has been observed at a single location only.

                                           Warmly,
                                                     Padgett

        ps I have now received a copy of "..THE  ONLY  ANTIVIRUS  SOFTWARE
           THAT WON'T BE OBSOLETE...". It proved an interesting  challenge
           to install since it kept  responding  to  keystrokes  I had not
           made on a test Zenith. In testing, the Int_10 blew right by it.
           I tried installing my  MBR  program  which  catches/removes the
           Int_10 with no problem but the  TSR  part  of the other program
           which loads from CONFIG.SYS started  saying  it "could not read
           the boot record" Huh ? My code  is  in the MBR & hidden sectors
           which TOAST found to be OK. I just write/format-protect the DBR
           doing nothing to block reads. Interesting, but...

	That rumor swept Washington Friday night after Bloomberg News service,

Run SYS with the infected floppy as the target. This is equally effective
at clearing boot-sector viruses from floppies as it is at clearing HDs. This
worked for clearing the Form virus (a boot-sector virus doing the rounds
here). Of course, it means that the floppy will now be bootable; I'm not
sure how to get around this one, except by deleting the hidden system files.

This behavior is unusual. Non-boot disk operations (DIR, COPY) do not access
the boot sector. F-PROT is probably getting a ghost positive of some sort.

There has been a long discussion is comp.sys.ibm.pc.misc about ways of
locking out the A: drive during boot-up. Posting an article there should
elicit some good advice.

Subject: Highly excessive HD spin with undelete sentry installed (PC)

Is it common for my state of the art Gateway2000 machine to spin the
hard disk for 2-3 minutes when adding a tiny, less than 1,000 byte,
file?

I belive this started after I installed Microsofts Undelete sentry
at full protection.  This sentry is advertised to make copy of anything
you delete into a special directory.  Then you have 7 days to
change your mind.  Nice dos 6 feature.

Ok, so deletes will take longer, but do I have a virus when
adding a file occasionaly takes 100 times as long as it should?

I stayed out of this the first round through since I was curious what
everyone else would think of this problem.  I physically inspected
these computers on October 14 since one of the computer lab consultants
at Pomona asked me if I could help them with their virus problems.  What
I found after rebooting from a clean diskette is that the MBR of these
machines looked completely normal.  F-prot 2.09f turned up nothing.
TBAV 6.07 on "heuristic" found two suspicious files, but I recognized these
as normal false positives for two Novell device drivers.  I compared the DOS
6 MBR (obtained with Norton Utilities 4.5) with the MBR on another DOS 6
machine that is probably uninfected, and they appeared identical.

My synopsis was that either the virus had been disinfected by someone or
that it was never there.

I'm glad frisk is warning people in this way-- it will help save a lot of
pain for people wondering why some "virus" is so easy to find in memory and
so difficult to find on disk.  I never saw this message since I used 2.09f
from the floppy. (Though as Vesselin suspected it was present in the
AUTOEXEC.BAT on the hard disk.)

Maybe frisk should add a message "This machine is infected with MSAV.
Remove? (Y/N):"  ;-)  Seriously, it might be a good idea for frisk's
software to disable VSAFE in memory while it is running.  Not only would
this eliminate the false positives, but it would demonstrate the inherent
security weakness in any TSR scanner that can be disabled through software.

I recommended that VSAFE be removed from the computers, even if it was not
replaced with anything.  I also recommended F-prot as a replacement, since
it would probably only cost $20 to protect the whole lab (the minimum).
Additionally I suggested that the CMOS be set up so the computers only booted
from the hard disk to prevent infection should a real virus make its way into
the lab.  However, the consultant at the lab seemed unreceptive to making any
changes, despite having asked me down to take a look.  Anyone have any hints
for methods to use to get them to understand why they need to get rid of MSAV?

PS:  Frisk, when will F-prot support disinfection of Stoned.Empire.Monkey?

Subject: New stoned? (PC)

We've encountered a new variant of STONED which totally corrupted the hard
drive's partition table in a very short time.  F-Prot identified the virus
as "a new variant of STONED." The partition table can't load itself into
memory. Happily, the file allocation tables appear to be intact, so we'll
be able to save the files.

I haven't yet tried to find the virus' signature, but does anyone have a
gut feeling as to the identity of this beastie?  I'm also wondering if
this may be a badly-hacked version of STONED by some local vandal.

He reports that SF2_UP.ZIP is an update file for Street Fighter 2, and on

It is indeed infected with a virus.

The following text appears in the virus

In my testing. this virus is 366 bytes long. Is a direct infector of .EXE
files and the virus is appended to the end of the host files.The virus is
also infectious in the second generation and beyond.

When this virus is run, it will infect a minimum of two .EXE files in the
current directory.

Since this virus is available on a CD-ROM. it may be in the wild. I will

I find that very hard to believe.  Do you have every published string
memorized?  As soon as you see a new virus, you can immediately know if
it was an attempt to avoid a string?  I don't think you would have checked
each one as soon as you got it.

How recently is that?

Do you keep a simple scanner that merely has all keyed strings and
will scan for them all over some file you give it, and show you how many
matches certain strings got over the whole string?

I believe this is more of an attack against SCAN, rather than an attack
against all AV products.  Most Virus people, I would speculate, realize
SCAN is not on the cutting edge of technology or virus detection/removal.
Take a looksee through some viruses for the text strings!  You will
see all sorts of rude messages based towards SCAN, or towards McAfee
in general.

I would imagine quite a few more than you would see with your name in
it, or Frisks, or Alan, or anyone.

This is because there is a large percentage of people who use (or,
at least did) use SCAN for their system.

They feel that if they can keep a virus from being detected by SCAN,
that most people will be able to be infected with their viruses.

Afraid I disagree here. The S-Bug screws up the memory allocation at the
TOM (see FAQ) & takes 9-10 k doing it. At present it is the *only* virus
I know of that has this easily-discernable characteristic so when active
it is *very* easy to detect.

Next, it uses an appending technique that is easy to spot heuristically
(albeit with the possiblity of a few false positives but if you have the
S-Bug, I doubt that this is going to bother anyone - so long as a similar
"immunizer" was not globaly applied previously - yet another reason they
are not a good idea).

True, removal is a bit more difficult but the next patch of "fast-update"
tools should be able to take care of it. If not, that's what backups are
for. The important thing is that it is *very* easy to spot when active.

I have said it before & will continue to say it: The most important thing
is to know that *something* has happened. *What* can come later.

Good warning...

I tried something a little less daring with Norton Disk Doctor. Monkey
appears to hide the original partition table somewhere else on disk, and
subsequently scrambles the original location. A two step procedure worked
here:

1. From a floppy disk, run NDD and rebuild the HD's partition table.

2. Use SYS to write a clean boot sector to the HD.

Could an expert verify step 2? I had an attack of Form at the same time
I had Monkey, so I can't tell if 2 is the correct means of removing Monkey.
However, the HD I used this method on is now clean.

TBAV has -many- things that F-Prot doesn't have. Some of them include
off-line integrity checker, resident integrity checker, heuristic
disinfector, generic disnifector, monitoring program, disk scrambler
(although I think they have moved it into a separate product), and
many others. Of all the kinds of anti-virus tools I know about, I
think that the only ones not present in TBAV are encryption, backup,
file immunization (which is a very bad idea anyway), and decoy
launching.

In general TBAV is an example of what a good anti-virus package should
contain. Unfortunately, all the components are not implemented in the
best way. The scanner is worse than F-Prot, the off-line integrity
checker is worse than Untouchable, the integrity shell is less secure
than ASP, and so on.

This message means that CLEAN does not recognize this particular
variant of Stoned. CLEAN has slightly better variant identification
than SCAN - because cleaning the wrong variant can (and often is)
desastrous.

Yes, because booting from a clean floppy does not change the virus
variant. It just removes it from memory.

The reason is that your computer is infected by a variant of Stoned
that CLEAN cannot clean.

> How can I safely remove the virus ?

Two alternatives:

1) Try a different (better) anti-virus program, which knows about your
particular virus variant and is able to remove it. CLEAN is a
relatively poor disinfector - it can disinfect only a rather limited
set of widespread viruses - see its documentation for more information
and a list of the viruses it can remove.

2) Boot from an uninfected, write-protected DOS 5.0 or higher system
diskette. Do a DIR C: and if you still see the few files on the
uncompressed volume, then run FDISK /MBR. This will remove the virus
from the hard disk. To remove it from the floppies, copy the files
somewhere else, format the floppy, and copy the files back.

The MtE generates some pretty generic code (TPE-generated code is even
more generic), so it is rather likely to find part of it in a
legitimate program. This explains why so many scanners (including
NAV) had problems with false positives with the MtE-based viruses.

> (I can't think of a good non-virus use for it, off the top of

You mean, a useful application that uses the MtE? Oh, it is certainly
possible. There are many cases where it should be difficult to
identify a particular program. Consider an integrity checker or some
other kind of security program. If a virus can detect it, it could
perform some kind of direct attack on it - patch it, add some code to
it, or whatever. (Of course, this can be prevented by keeping a good
copy on a write-protected floppy, and using only it, but do you really
believe that the regular users are disciplined enough to do that?) So,
it might be useful if the installation program always generates a
different instance of the security program - for instance, by using
some kind of polymorphic engine. Of course, using the MtE itself would
be stupid - because most of the existing scanners recognize only the
MtE-generated decryptors (not the MtE-based viruses themselves) and
will flag the program as containing such a virus - which will probably
make most users reluctant to use it.

> CPAV is trash when it comes to detecting any virus, so don't worry

When comparing the MtE-detection capabilities, I would say that NAV
2.1 is even worse. For more information - refer to my article about
the MtE detection tests. CPAV was able to detect reliably at least
some of the MtE-based viruses used during the test.

Unless, of course, you intend to use it on a XT, because I was told
that NAV 3.0 simply doesn't work on such machines.

Oh, there are several. Curiously enough, even CPAV is able to
disinfect some of the MtE-based viruses - usually those that infect
only COM files.

All,

What follows is a compiled list of viruses in the wild. Please don't view
the list as a "common" list, since each "x" may represent 1 or dozens of
reports. Moreover, some viruses are reported more almost by nature, like
Michelangelo--which has more x's in the list than Form while Form is in
fact far more common.

Subject: The Global Shield. Integrity checker. Beta test. (PC)

Hello everyone.

I've got a big number of replies on my previous post about beta-testing
of Integrity checker/recovery utility. I arranged the package in some
anonymous FTP sites. The name of file is: GS.ZIP (87356 bytes).
It includes README file. The package can be found in:

ftp.cso.uiuc.edu  pc/virus/gs.zip
risc.ua.edu       /pub/ibm-antivirus/gs.zip
urvax.urich.edu   MSDOS.ANTIVIRUS/GS.ZIP

Briefly about package:

It is a full-scale integrity checker with powerful recovery
capabilities.  Works on IBMPC under MS DOS 3.30+. Was created for the
purpose of fighting unknown/future viruses. Can also detect
unknown/possible boot viruses and recover boot/partition sector. Saves
"tiny" images of selected files to be used later for integrity
checking and complete recovery of files/disks in case of further
infection. Can be used on Networks.

I will appreciate any responses and opinions of described product.

Thanks to everyone who already replied.

All McAfee files (clean, scan, vshld, etc) are now located in the following
directory:

              /pub/ibm-antivirus/Mirrors/mcafee

Please note the capital "M" in "Mirrors".  Please make any necessary changes
in your anonymous FTP scripts.
