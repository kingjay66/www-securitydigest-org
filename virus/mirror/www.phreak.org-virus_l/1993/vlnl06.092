Yes, but how would they go about proving that you wrote a virus that
actually caused harm?  Most virus authors don't sign their work (not
with their real name, at any rate), and last time I checked it wasn't
illegal to write a virus -- just to deliberately infect other machines
such that it causes damage.

I can't for the life of me imagine what the FBI would do there but
congradulate you on your winnings.  It would make more sense to have
the IRS there to make sure you pay the taxes on your winnings.

I do not believe that writing self-replicating code could break any
law, if so players of CoreWars, or researchers using Tierra would be
in danger of breaking the same law.  While (as I understand it) there
are laws pertaining to illegal entry into a computer system, which a
virus infestation might be covered under, I doubt it would apply if
you went there and introduced the code with the companies knowledge
and permission.

I don't mean to imply that I like the idea of the contest (I don't
mean to imply that I am against it either.)  I just would be very
surprised to find that winning the contest would break any laws.  I
also don't think that winning the contest would imply that you are
some notorious virus-writer.  I would expect that many to most of the
people concentrating on anti-viral software (especially viral shields)
would have the skills needed to investigate the security of the
system.  It is their ethics/morals/dispossition/nature that has them
direct their skills to anti-viral work rather than viral work.

Actually it is usually simpler, In most Double Boot systems I know it
goes like this:
The partition table itself is a program that prompts for type of
desired boot, the selection made by the user replaces the "Active
Partition" byte in the MBR and reboots, so that this time the next
step in the chain (reading the boot-sector) is calling the desired
boot-loader, and it continues the load chain normally.

JW:

Either way, if the MBR itself is the boot manager or the MBR points to
the boot manager (the active partition is the boot manager`s) the
partition *may* look different.

JW:

I wouldnt bet my life on it.  I would highly recommend that any user
that has such a disk will have a backup of the partition-table and
Boot-Sectors on a floppy. This can be achieved with DISKPART (of the
V-CARE Anti-Virus) or Norton`s DISKEDIT, CHIEF`s BACKINFO ( and
probably other tools as well).

Any other attempt to mess with the MBR of such a disk may cause severe
damage.

The Quox is a reasonably simple diskette and Master Boot Record
infector.  It's "stealthed" in the sense that if you use INT13
to read an infected boot record, it will show you the original
clean one instead.  It has no particular payload and no text
strings.  We got a sample from Thailand in July of 1992, and
I named it "Quox" because there was no obvious good name, and
we didn't have very many viruses starting in "Q".

It infects only the master boot record of a hard disk; to
clean up, cold-boot from a clean floppy, make sure all your
hard disk partitions are there, and then use FDISK /MBR.
To clean up a floppy, copy the files off and FORMAT /U.
Or use IBM AntiVirus or some other anti-virus that can deal
with it.

I see no evidence that F-PROT was wrong.  Most likely, you had
some variant of the Sticky virus.   The Sticky virus is indeed
a _Screaming First_ variant (in the sense that Sticky shares lots
of code with the various Scream or Screaming Fist viruses).  The
main difference is that Sticky infects both boot records and files.

"Genp" is just SCAN's way of saying "something virus-like in the
boot record, but I don't know which virus it is".  In that sense,
SCAN was misidentifying the virus at least as badly as F-PROT was!

The virus does indeed assume that all files with extension "COM"
or "EXE" must be infectable programs.  On the other hand, DOS does,
too!   *8)   If you type the name of that VAX .COM file, your
machine will probably hang (don't try this at home, kids!).

If the virus was the usual strain of the Sticky (can't tell for
sure, since F-PROT saw it as a variant, and SCAN doesn't do
any sort of verification), it has no payload, so if all the
infected objects have been cleaned up, and all contacts alerted
and scanned, you're done...

But that doesn't *physically* destroy the track!   If the disk is
low-level formatted, it'll get the normal sector numbers written
again.  The tracks are physically fine, they just (temporarily)
have odd stuff written in the little magnetic fields...           DC

This doesn't make sens. If the door has been opened since last disk
access, it is reasonable to assume that the floppy was replaced,
therefore it is necessary to first check the type of disk and to
calculate the location of the FATS, or else you might read garbage.

Too much work for some pretty obviouse conclusion: The floppy was
replased.

If what you sujjest is right, whay is it necessary to acess the boot
sector every time?

I've written a small ISR that beeps on INT 13h ant tried it with some
of the services you've mentioned. Unless all the calles to these
services adone by CALL and not INT (which is quite a resonable
posibility), there was not even one beep, however it beeps chirfully
on int 13h "Read" head-0 cyl-0 sec-1.  several time upon replacement,
then single time on each access.

If someone has virus source code, he/she ought to have participated

Subject: New virus in Chile, not detected by newest scanners (PC)

A  variant  of the CPW virus, not detected by SCAN 104  or  FPROT
2.08a,  has  been found on a LAN server, in  central  CHILE.  The
virus has a good spread potential, because the net connects a few
hundred  PC's,  and users have working  relationships  with  many
other commercial an educational institutions in the Country.

The  "original" CPW is reported (at least) in VSUM9304. I do  not
have  a  copy  of  that virus. Virus  features  listed  here  for
comparison are extracted from VSUM9304.

The  original virus was written in CHILE, presumably  by  someone
whose initials are CPW. The virus is detected by SCAN 99+,  FPROT
2.07+ and others.

I have performed a few experiments with the variant. Results are:

- - The  new virus infects (at least) EXE and COM files,  including
  COMMAND.COM,  increasing file size by 1527 (decimal)  bytes  on
  both  file types. Same behavior as the original, although  file
  growth was 1459 bytes.

- - When  an  infected program is run, the  virus  installs  itself
  memory  resident  reducing available memory by  2000  (decimal)
  bytes,  as reported by MEM, exactly like the original. It  does
  not  show up as a memory resident program in MEM's list.  I  do
  not know which interrupts are hooked.

- - The  virus  infects  files  (at least)  on  execution  or  copy
  operations.  It  does  not infect every time  an  operation  is
  performed. I do not know the pattern.

- - When resident, the virus does not forge file size as  indicated
  by DIR. This is an easy way to identify infected files.

- - When  resident, the virus erases a program named SCAN.EXE  when
  execution  is  attempted. Same as the  original.  Renaming  the
  program avoids erasure.

- - No  messages  are  visible  in the  infected  files.  They  are
  encripted.  Messages  are  visible in memory,  with  the  virus
  active. They say:

  "CPW fue hecho en Chile en 1992,  VIVA CHILE MIERDA!"

  meaning:

  "CPW was made in Chile in 1992". Last part is a popular  saying
  here. Translation would not be polite...

  Original  virus  messages  are similar, but  not  encripted  on
  infected  files. Virus author is probably the same one. He  has
  "perfected" his work.

- - SCAN  102,  SCAN 104, FPROT 2.07, FPROT 2.08a and MSAV  do  not
  detect  the  virus on infected files. I have not  tested  other
  programs.

- - SCAN 102 and SCAN 104 do find the virus when active in  memory,
  identifing it as *1530*.

- - FPROT 2.07 sniffs the virus on heuristic scanning.
  Message  for COM files is: "This is a  self-modifying  program,
  which  may  indicate a self-encrypting virus  or  just  unusual
  code."
  Message  for  EXE  files is:  "This  program  contains  several
  features  which are normally only found in virus programs.   It
  is almost certainly virus-infected."
  FPROT 2.08a, however, does not detect the virus on heuristics!

FPROT 2.07 is (to my knolewdge) the best tool available for  fast
identification of infected files.

I have no idea about virus payload, if any.

Infected samples will be sent to known researchers.

Hello,

my 3,5" drive can"t read HD drives.

1.st there were no problems - but suddenly from one day to
another, DOS says : General failure !!

Sometimes it works and sometimes not. After cleaning the drive
it still doesn"t read.

So, whats wrong with this drive. If it  reads 3,5" HD disc there are not
too many noises so i think the head are still in good positions.
By the way, is there anywhere a testprogramm for this ??

I ran different virus scanner - all with a negativ result.

Does anybody know what to do ??

Thanks

Subject: Evaluating Activity Monitors (CVP)


PRTAVSB.CVP   930522

                  Evaluation of Activity Monitors

It is very difficult to specify, in advance, what you should check
for in activity monitoring software, since the developers are loath
to state, in specific detail, exactly what the program will be
checking for.  (This reluctance is understandable: if a developer
"advertises" exactly what the product checks for, virus or "trojan"
writers will simply use another route.)  In addition, the work or
computing environment must be considered, as well, in certain cases,
as the "corporate climate".  Activity monitors, more than scanners
or change detectors, are subject to review on the basis of
"political" rather than technical grounds.

Activity monitoring software should be thoroughly tested in a "real"
working environment (one that uses all the programs you normally do,
in the ways you normally use them) for some time in order to ensure
that the vaccine does not conflict with "normal" operation.  The
"real" environment includes the "real" people who will be using the
software: chose your "sample" population carefully and avoid simply
giving it to the tech support office to test.  Two important factors
to check for are the number of "false positives" (or false alarms)
that the software generates, and the level of information given to
the user when an anomalous condition is detected.  This last is
difficult to judge: user populations who tend to remain at the
"novice" level will have no more confidence in the system regardless
of how much information it gives them.

While activity monitors have a good chance to detect viral activity
of "new" and unknown viral strains, it would be very difficult to
agree with those that claim to be able to detect "all current and
future" viral programs.  While it might generally be held to be a
"good thing" to prevent changes to the file allocation table, it is
unlikely that FAT or "system" viri could have been foreseen prior to
the existence of the "DIR" family.  Activity monitors are also
unlikely to work well against "companion" type viral programs
without specific safeguards in place.

Monitoring programs should be tested against a battery of viral
programs, but the "test suite" should be collected on the basis of
function rather than simply diversity.  If the activity monitor is
effective against Stoned, then Empire, Michelangelo and Monkey
variants are unlikely to trouble it.

Unfortunately, activity monitors tend to encourage a "set and
forget" mentality towards viral protection.  This should be avoided
at all costs.  If activity monitoring software is your protection
method of choice, continue to keep up to date with viral methods and
test your software regularly.

Computer Virus Handbook, Harold Joseph Highland, 1990, 0-946395-46-2

When Dr. Highland first offered to send me a copy of this work, late in 1992,
he indicated that it was outdated.  In some respects this is true.  Some of the
precautions suggested in a few of the essays which Dr. Highland did not write
tend to sound quaint.  As one example, with the advantage of hindsight, Jon
David's ten page antiviral review checklist contains items of little use, and
has a number of important gaps.  However, for the "general", rather than
"specialist" audience, this work has much to recommend it.  The coverage is
both broad and practical, and the information, although not quite up to date,
is complete and accurate as far as it goes.

The book starts with, as the title has it, "Basic Definitions and Other
Fundamentals".  Dr. Highland has collected definitions from a number of sources
here, which makes a refreshing change from some of the dogmatic assertions in
other works.  The fact that the reader is left to make his own final decision
as to a working definition might be frustrating to some, but is likely
reasonable given that the argument over the definition of a virus is still
raging to this day.  With the changes that are still taking place in terms of
new "forms" of viral programs, it is unlikely that this debate will be settled
any time soon.

Chapter one also contains important background information on the operation of
the PC and the structure of MS-DOS format disks.  The one shortcoming might be
that so much of the book deals with MS-DOS machines that readers dealing with
other systems may fail to note the generic concepts contained therein.

Chapter two is a concise but encompassing overview of the viral situation by
William Hugh Murray.  Using epidemiology as a model, he covers the broad
outline of viral functions within a computing "environment", and examines some
theoretical guidelines to direct the building of policy and procedures for
prevention of viral infection.  The article is broadly helpful without ever
pushing the relation between computer viral and human epidemiology too far.

Chapter three deals with history and examples of specific viral programs.  This
section is an extremely valuable resource.  While other works reviewed have
contained similar sections, the quality of this segment in Highland's tome is
impressive.  Mention must be made of the reports by Bill Kenny of Digital
Dispatch who provides detailed and accurate descriptions of the operations of a
number of viral programs which are, unfortunately, all still too common.
(Chapter four is similar, containing three reports of viral programs from other
sources.)

Large sections of the handbook deal with the evaluation and review of antiviral
software.  (I must say that I had great sympathy with that part of the preface
which dealt with some experiences encountered when trying to test various
packages.)  Chapter five gives an evaluation protocol and test methodology.
The detail here may lead some to skip over it, but it is helpful to those who
wish to determine how thoroughly the testing was conducted.  Chapter six, an
article by Jon David as mentioned earlier, is a suggested procedure and
checklist for testing antiviral software.  This chapter is unfortunately weak,
and although there is some valuable direction, one comes away with the
impression that the important thing to test is whether the program runs on a
VGA monitor and has a bound manual.  One must, of course, realize that
antiviral testing was then in its infancy, and Mr. David's article reflects the
general tone fo those times.  Chapter seven is concerned with specific product
evaluations, and, as most lists of its type do, shows its age.  Of the twenty
products listed, I recognize only seven as still being in existence,; of those
that still do exist four have changed substantially in the intervening three
years.

Chapter eight is an essay by Harry de Maio entitled "Viruses - A Management
Issue", and it must be considered one of the "forgotten gems" of virus
literature.  It debunks a number of myths, and raises a number of issues seldom
discussed in corporate security and virus management.  Chapter nine is similar,
being Dr. Highland's suggested procedures for reducing the risk of computer
virus infection.

Chapter ten is a collection of essays on theoretical aspects of computer virus
research and defence.  Fred Cohen is heavily represented here, of course, but
not as singularly as in, for example, Hoffman's "Rogue Programs".

Dated as the book may be in some respects, it is still a valuable overview for
those wishing to study viral programs or the defence against them, particularly
in a corporate environment.  While some may find the book to be "academic" in
tone, it never launches into "blue sky" speculations: all of the material here
is realistic.  The "aging" of the product reviews makes it difficult to
consider it still a reference "handbook" or a "how to" resource, but Dr.
Highland's work is by no means to be discarded yet.
