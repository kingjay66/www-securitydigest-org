I've also used F-Prot to scan my hardisk and indeed had several COM files
that were suspicious of being infected with the E-Rilluttanza virus. I've
send those files to Mcafee. I hope they can help.

To my own problem I deleted those suspected files and copied uninfected
files over it.

This virus could be a Trojan virus but I don't think any virus could be
benign.

I'm new to this conference, so I don't know a whole lot about virus
prevention.  My question is, what is a "scanstring"?  Is this something
the McAfee program uses?

Subject: MBR infection recovery software (PC)

	Within the last month or so of reading Comp.Virus, I have
noticed a certain pattern in the posts.  After having read and
responded to a number of posts regarding infections in the boot
sector, partition record, or master boot record of a hard disk, I have
come to the conclusion that the majority of people do not know how to
make the neccessary recovery disks before an infection, nor do they
know how to properly recover once infected.  There is a file
available(unfortunately it is not yet on internet, it will be soon I
hope) which explains in detail What backups to make, How to make them,
why to make them, and how to use them to recover from an infection of
the MBR, boot sector, or partition table.
	The file is called DRFINFO.ZIP and is available for
download from Action Link Systems in Bradenton, FL.

813-747-9295 v32/42bis 14.4Kb
813-747-9670 HST       14.4Kb

Included are the utilities needed to backup the MBR and CMOS,
as well as vital information on how to use these utilities in
case of an infection.

This is FREEWARE.  All you have to do is download it.  The file
only takes a few minutes  to download,  and the information it
will provide you will more than pay for the time spent online.

Feel free to contact me with any questions

Subject: Automated Virus Writing Programs (PC)

I've heard alot lately about programs that actually write or create
viruses. I think Virus Creation Laboratory is the name of one. Does
anyone out there know anything about these programs? How many are there
and where do they come from. I read one article where a anti-virus
researcher wrote one of these programs to create viruses which he could
the scan with various virus scanning programs. I would seem to me that
most anyone who could get hold of these program could then become a
virus programer. Sounds dangerous to me. Anyway I just want to know more
about them.

I am the administrator of a LAN Server network.  I have set it up so
that directories containing executables are read/execute permission
for ordinary users.  I may be living in a fools paradise, but I
believe (hope :-)) that this protects the executables.  In addition
the NOS provides an optional file for each user called PROFILE.BAT
which is executed at login.  I have set this up with the use of the
"at" command so that each user has several critical files SCANed daily
and all files on the local hard drive weekly.  Note that I would rate
our virus exposure to be low to moderate (more low).

Hope these thoughts may help.  Comments regarding efficacy of the
above method greatly appreciated.

Subject: DIR-2 and STONED in Israel (PC)

This is in response to a response to my original message warning
people about an infected computer game that was being given away by
the Co-op Supermarket of Israel as a promotion for Scott Tissue toilet
paper.  The computer game (ZOOM) was infected by DIR-2 and STONED.  I
would have followed the quote-and-reply protocol, but my modem dropped
the connection last time I tried, and now the reponse is no longer on
comp.virus.

The respondent in question said that he had personally scanned the
master game disks as well as samples of the distributed disks,
and had found no copies of the virus.  He then went on to publicly
chastise me for infecting the disk and blaming the Co-op and Scott
Tissue.

The facts are:

   -My machine was (as it always is) clean.
   -I scanned another machine and then scanned the disk again on this
    machine.  The machine was clean and the disk wasn't.
   -If my machine gave the viruses to the game disk, then the viruses
    would have been found on my machine.  They weren't.
   -I didn't blame anyone.  I said that I picked up a disk from the
    Co-op Supermarket, that the disk was infected, that probably all
    their disks were infected and that people shouldn't use the disk.
    The only statement I implied that was incorrect was that all their
    disks were infected.
   -According to a national Israeli newspaper "dozens of people were
    affected" by the DIR-2 and STONED viruses found on these disks.
    Since I didn't talk to this paper, "dozens" doesn't include me.

What can we conclude from this?  Well, it's unlikely that dozens of
people all had the DIR-2 and STONED viruses on their systems (and no
other virus), and didn't notice this until they scanned this game
disk.  Evidentially, a small number of disks were contaminated, and
not due to an infected master disk.  Perhaps some people took the game
home, infected it, and returned it, and the Co-op distributed the
infected returns.  Perhaps some stock-boys played with the game on
infected back-room PCs, and then stuck the disks back out for
distribution.  Perhaps there was an infected duplication machine which
was used for a small run of disks and later cleaned before the
respondent (who's name escapes me) checked it.  Perhaps the respondent
should REFRAIN FROM YELLING at people before carefully reading their
posts and checking details with them.

Subject: New virus (off-road) (PC).

Hello everyone,

A new virus was submitted to us just yesterday and following are its
characteristis:

- - COM infector.
- - Effective length 894 bytes.
- - Encrypted - simple XOR - single layer encryption.
- - Virus hooks Int-08h (timer).
- - After decryption the following pieces of text may be seen   in the virus
code: "AMEF0\OFF-ROAD"   "*.com *.*"   "????????COM"
- - The virus is targetting COM files, infecting an entire directory at once.
- - Its activation date is every 3ed month of the year (March), in which it
formats floppies enterd at that day.
- - Also the virus checks for mondays (???).

IT was named "OFF-ROAD" due to the text fond inside.

The reason i decided to publish this, is that it seems this virus was NOT
originated in Israel and one should expect it to apear in other places of the
world soon.

No Anti virus detects or cleans it, (Except of-course generic detectors and
cleaners such as our own V-CARE, by which is was detected and isolated).

If anyone have more information on this virus, please e-mail me ASAP.

keep well

Yeah, if the virus is not in memory you can copy the data onto your disk,
format the infected disk then recopy the files back onto it.

That is correct. The McAfee-scanner does pick up TPE as 'TridenT', atleast
the v105 did.

They made about 10-20 virusses, in about 6 strains. The best known are
Crunshor, Coffyshop... They are dutch BTW...

Subject: Bizarre F-Prot corruption (PC)

I've got no idea what this could be - perhaps a freak accident.  In
any case, I had F-Prot 2.08 on my PC which I use for scanning for
viruses.  Yesterday I went to make a scan and the virus definition
file had been corrupted.  F-Prot gave a syntax error in the SIGN.DEF
file.  Looking over my disk with NAV showed a possible "unidentified"
virus in f-prot.exe (my NAV is VERY old) and no other suspicious
activity on the disk.  Is there some fprot targeting virus, or is this
a freak coincidence that this file went bad?  A surface scan of my HD
showed no bad sectors or areas.  Finally, where can I get the newest
copy of fprot?  Thanks much,

Can anyone supply tech info on the Stamford virus. I'm interested mostly
in how it propagates. This is what I do know:

Turns good floppies into "General Disk Failure" after short time of use.

Only detectable with "scan /m c:" and is reported as being resident in RAM
[Stam] but is not found on the hard drive itself.

I could not get rid of it with dos format or dos fdisk. Low level hard disk
format (as you would expect) cleaned up the problem.

Any Comments?

BULL ! Another virus myth that started with the MusicBug. True, the BPB
(boot parameter block) in the FORM may be damaged (never really looked),
BUT the FORM DBR contains the pointer to the Real DBR that FORM stashed
out on the disk. All that is needed is to
a) boot from clean floppy
b) grab the apparent DBR (actually the FORM Virus)
c) extract the CX and DX values for retrieving the Real DBR (think in
   doubleword at 4Dh but no guarentees from memory - obvious from code 8*)
d) grab the Real DBR and copy back over the FORM DBR

(Could be fully automatic if you KNOW that it is the Mk 1(A) FORM but a DBR
is obvious, could even "walk the disk" & find it or just take the P-table
values and create a brand new one - not that difficult, just tedious).

Of course this does nothing for any corrupted sectors (three ?) but does defang
the FORM and the disk is again safely bootable.

As previously mentioned this was exactly the same as the early problem with
the MusicBug but change 1 byte and the difficulty in booting clean went away.
(Just an aside - actually MusicBug & Form recovery is nothing more than
a boot floppy & debug - it doesn't matter that DOS cannot find the partition.)

ps am a bit disappointed, data recovery has not progressed beyond 1990 except
   in a few cases. Where have all of the profits the A-V vendors have made
   gone ? Apparently not into R & D 8*(. Is it just that the public does not
   know what is possible ?

Can anyone comment on the performance of the 2 programs mentioned above?
Which one offers more security, features, less false alarms..etc..

Subject: Integrity Master V2 arrives! (PC)

Stiller Research announces release of Integrity Master(tm) version 2.01a

Version 2.01a was released August 14th.

Integrity Master provides complete, easy to use, data integrity for your
PC plus virus protection.  It can also be used to provide file change
management and security on your PC.  As well as scanning for known
viruses, it detects unknown viruses and unlike other products will
detect files which have been damaged but not infected by a virus.
INTEGRITY MASTER PROTECTS YOU AGAINST ALL THREATS TO YOUR DATA AND
PROGRAMS NOT JUST VIRUSES!  IM is ASP shareware.

New with version 2:

1) IM will now check your CMOS memory for any changes that could affect
   the integrity of your PC.  IM can also reload your CMOS if needed. IM
   checks and reloads all possible CMOS not just 64 bytes supported by
   most CMOS programs.  When your base CMOS changes, IM will display
   details on what was changed (e.g., floppy or hard drive setup). The
   "/CC" option initiates CMOS checking from the command line. "/CC" may
   be used with other "/Cx" type options.

2) IM now provides extensive control over when it will update your
   integrity data for changed files.  If you suspect file problems, IM
   can now check your files without updating the integrity data or IM
   will ask what to do individually when certain files change. IM will
   of course continue to not update, when a known virus or a disk error
   causes a change to a file.

3) SetupIM has been enhanced to provide more specific guidance if you
   make potentially unwise option choices  (such as recording off-line
   integrity data to a hard-disk rather than a floppy).

4) Sysops take note! IM will now tolerate a superfluous "*.*", "*.EXE
   *.COM", or even something like "D:\VIRUS\UPLOAD\*.*" as the first
   parameter on the command line or as part of the /Pyyyyy change
   directory command line option.  This provides compatibility with some
   BBS upload processors that insist on including this on the command
   line.

5) IM now has an option to scan the current and all lower directories
   from the current subdirectory for known viruses.  The new command
   line switch for this is "/VL".

6) IM identifies 200 new viruses by name and characteristic.

                     Where do I find it?
                     -------------------
