What's to prevent my own program from releasing these interlocks if they

Much though I appreciate Anthony's skill and the Intel people's helpfulness,
I am afraid that such a scheme is essentially "security by obscurity".
Agreed, that the "boot block" probably does some very sophisticated
authentication yet the details *must* be as simple to obtain as disassembling
the BIOS (and is probably in the near vicinity of the original jump).

Tools exist to do just such a thing, there is nothing mystical about
the BIOS even one using Flash ROMs.

The "boot block" is still just software and can be fooled by anything
that understands exactly what it is looking for. Not saying that discovering
how would be trivial, just that it can be done. As such I remain convinced
that the only answer is in hardware, probably a key switch tied to the
write enable line and which also invokes a special BIOS section just for
updating and which cannot boot otherwise so long as the switch is enabled.

Not difficult and easy to verify. Intel has tried to do something with the
limitation that it must be compatable with existing hardware. Fine. But
be aware that this mechanism is inherantly flawed and if Intel says that
it isn't (and I do not believe that they would be so unintelligent) then I
say "prove it".
					Warmly,
						Padgett

(Of course if Intel should happen to wish to send a non-returnable sample,
 preferably wrapped in a 486DX-50 (NO Pentiums, my a/c bill is high enough
 as it is) with 16 Mb of RAM, 340 MB disk and all the goodies, I would be
 happy to play with it 8*).

The only comparable reference to the Dark Avenger in Clough and Mungo
relates to the release of MtE - rather than current (or future) events.
On the penultimate page of the original English edition of their book
they wrote, " ... the virus the Dark Avenger had promised ... duly appeared
in May 1991. He called it Mutating Engine and it may well be able to
disguise itself in 4 billion different ways."

However, after considering the ensuing year (up to the publication
of their book), they added, " ... it [MtE] has engendered almost no
publicity, a disquieting situation for the world's most famous virus
writer."  They claim that Dark Avenger attempted to sell his engine
to pirate boards in England - apparently without success. Could it just
be that (hope against hope) that these diminishing returns are persuading
Dark Avenger that his/her reputation cannot be easily enlarged? If so,
retirement could seem the better option.

Subject: Bait files

I observe increasing reference to the use of "bait files" as a means
to detect virus activity. What more specifically are bait files? What
characteristics do bait files have that make them more succulent and
desirable to ALL viruses (including unknown viruses) than juicy, fat,
frequently-used application programs or operating system executables?

Hi,

Does anyone know groups or individuals who study / follow virus and hacker
activities in Asia / Pacific, whether they are in government, industry, or
academia?  I am particularly interested in groups / individuals in Australia,
Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea.

Thank you very much for your help.

Subject: of interest

I am new to both the pc world and the internet. Already I have
developed an interest in Viri -out of sheer paranoia initially.

But - as regards evaluation: The more people aware of the threat the
more likely adequate measures taken(this point is often made). But
this requires ease of use, easily recognisable quality and education.

So as a "lay antivi prog user"(also, I have not had to use these
against a virus) I offer an evaluation of some packages I know as
follows:

Vis(total control) - excellent information and explanation
scanning is very good
tsr is very good
interface none to speak of
cost ok

F-prot - information not so good, lacks an educational aspect
scanning is excellent
tsr is very good - some concern about it able to load as device driver
interface is excellent
cost excellent

Dr. Solomons - information ok
scanning ok - wary of limitations
tsr ok
interface ok
cost terrible

Dos6 central point - information ok
scanning ok - again wary
interface ok - flashy
cost ultimately terrible considering upgrades

Proposed study

group of people - measure knowledge of computers, viruses, etc.
present them with 4-8 anti progs
ask them to evaluate
after wards test for ease of use, gain in awareness, their evaluation
of package etc.

If anybody is interested I may be willing to do above study - need
some support, not necessarily financial or though may be important as
participants usually paid stlg3 an  hour - have access to participants
and if supported then probably to computers as well.

Following my recent comments about the Dark Avenger here, I have received
some obviously bogus email from "DarkAvenger@sofia.somewhere.bg".

The 'virus underground' supposedly regard him as a 'hero', yet this
behaviour seems to be a calculated insult.

So I am interested to learn who is performing this impersonation, and why.
If you have received similar messages you can help by telling me and/or
forwarding a copy to me to study.

	My company has a site license for a product called VirHunt,
made by Digital Dispatch Inc., of Mn.  It doesn't show up on the
comparisons posted here because it is primarily used as the engine
behind several other products.  DDI isn't willing to tell me which
products, though some can be determined by version number, which is
somewhere around 3.1c.  Anyone know which products use this engine, so
I can determine its relative worth?

Subject: Loren virus - we've been hit! (PC)

Our Physics Dept. here at Carleton University has been hit by the Loren
virus. The virus was distributed via an NFS network and has apparently hit
all attached network workstations infecting numerous .com and .exe files.

Apparently, this virus, if left alone long enough, will format your hard
drive. The lastest Virus Summary Listing does not list this virus, although
Scan v107 from Mcafee Assoc. knows about Loren and Clean v107 will delete
files infected with this virus.

If anyone has more information on this virus or advice to offer, please
contact me.

Subject: The form virus vs. F-prot 2.09d (PC)

I run a computer lab and all of the computers run f-prot on boot-up
to check for viruses.

There is a virus going around and f-prot calls it the Form virus.

1)  One computer reported having the Form virus after boot-up.  I rebooted
the computer and on the next boot-up it didn't think it was infected.

2)  I had some diskettes with the Form virus on it.  I went to disinfect
it on a clean computer.  F-prot reported that the Form virus was in
memory and wouldn't disinfect the diskettes.  This happened on a few
different clean machines, machines that won't boot from the a: drive.
If the memory scan was turned off, the computers would disinfect the
diskette without trouble.  I was able to disinfect other diskettes
without incident.

The lab uses AT&T 6386WGS computers with olivetti bios and IBM
valuepoint computers with IBM bios.  Both have been inconsistantly
detecting the virus.

After repeated attempts with fprot and liberal use of fdisk /MBR,
the virus seems to be gone.

Anyone else ever have problems with the form virus and f-prot?

Subject: Cruncher virus versions? (PC)

I have 2 versions of the Cruncher virus.  The one version asks permission
all the time, and will not infect a file without asking first.  The other
compresses all of them all the time.  The majority of the files that I
have infected with the cruncher were, in fact, compressed rather well.
The problem was that the majority of the well-compressed files would not
execute.

Note that the virus is inherently scannable, because it is a modified
version of the Coffeeshop virus.  The main virus code is nearly
identicle.


And by the way:  I looked up the word VIRUS in 7 different medical
dictionaries. They _all_ say the plural is VIRUSES. Never did I see the
words VIRII (Which, when broken down, has more to do with fertility than
with VIRUS), VIRA, or VIRI (Which VIRI does have a meaning in latin, but
it is totally unrelated).

I just thought that was interesting.

Subject: Viruses and Ctrl-Break (PC)

While analysing viruses, I've noted that during the infection routine
many of them turn off both DOS critical error handler and Ctrl-Break
checking.

It is obvious why the critical error messages are suppressed,
but I can't figure out why to disable Ctrl-Break. Viruses that disable
Ctrl-Break checking include at least Phoenix.800, TPE.1_0.Girafe and
Hidenowt.

Does anybody have any idea about why they're doing it?

Subject: Is this a Windows virus? (PC)

Greetings!
As the subject says, we are afraid that we have a virus on our
machines in our Computer-Aided Design lab.  We just received 10 new
IBM 486/66DX2 ValuePoint to add to the 10 we recieved back in March.
All of the machines are set to boot up into Windows 3.1 initially.
When students go exit exit Windows, the computer locks up and even
though the "OK to exit Windows" box has been clicked in, the screen
freezes and Windows stays on the screen but the mouse and keyboard no
longer respond.  Additionally, when the machine boots up, it reports
an "1101" serial port error.  The setup screen is displayed and when
you exit setup, the machine then boots normally.  As long as you don't
exit Windows, Windows applications operate just fine.  We have an
older version of Central point Anti-Virus that we ran on several
machines that found a "Hong-Kong" Virus, however, CPAV was unable to
successfully remove it we think.  If this sounds familiar, please
e-mail me at the address below as I don't normally read this group
(I'm a designer, not a hacker! :) ).  Thanx in advance for any help.

This is TOTALLY irrelevant! The time it took a program to check the hard disk
MUST be masured when NO virus is present. Only then you will get a true
picture of the scanning speed. When a virus is found the scan time becomes
irrelevant!

The number of viruses detected is also the oldest test in the book. If someone
else were to do the same test on his collection of viruses the results might
turn out to be
vice-versa (Immagine that I have only those samples that TBAV doesn't know,
but SCAN knows...).

If this is the best measure you find for your test, I cant immagine what the
others say... If anyone should use these tests as a reccomendation for a
product to buy, he'd better be ready to by another new product this year.

Nothing special here, your system simply crashed for some reason. Probably some
 random instruction caused it to print memory to your printer and your screen.
  The BIOS program that causes Cntrl-alt-del to reset locked up too.

This is your phonebook file.  You probably caused it to grow when you added the
 bbses to it.  The AV program probably flagged it because  .fon means fonebook
and alse font, and sometimes .fon font files are like .EXEs.

This is because PCPLUS doesn't come with a phonebook; you have to create one.

You probably ought to download SCANVxxx.ZIP, where xxx is the number of the
current version.  This is McAffe's viruscan program, and others are available
too.

     Version 108 of the VIRUSCAN (SCAN, CLEAN, VSHIELD, WSCAN,
OS2SCAN, and OS2CLEAN) adds detection  of 42 new virus, bringing
the total number of known viruses to 1,655, or counting variants,
2,351 viruses.

CLEAN-UP

     Version 108 adds disinfection of both the Chile Mediera
virus, a .COM, .EXE, and overlay file infector reported as being
widespread in Chile, and the Loren virus, which has been reported
at multiple sites in California.

VSHIELD

     Two new options were added to VSHIELD, the /BOOT and /NOFLOPPY
switches.  The /BOOT switch tells VSHIELD to check the boot sector
of a diskette whenever it is accessed.  The second switch, /NOFLOPPY,
can be used with the /ACCESS switch to disable floppy disk boot
sector checking.

     Version 107 of VSHIELD, which was not uploaded to any ftp sites
on the Internet, added several new features, such as EMS support and
greater compatibility with Windows.  Please refer to the documentation
for details.

Subject: Stealth (CVP)

DEFGENB.CVP   930908

                              Stealth

A virus usually contains some kind of identifiable string or code
that can be used to identify it.  Even if the virus is new or
polymorphic, it still adds its code to the infected program, thus
adding to the size.  Even if the virus overwrites original code so
that it does not add to the length of the file, and even if the
virus tries to match a "checksum" calculated on the code
overwritten, a sophisticated CRC (cyclic redundancy check) or other
signature will still find a change.  So how to hide from all of
these detection mechanisms?

Lie.

Or, rather, get the computer to lie for you.

"Stealth" technology, as applied to computer viral programs, most
broadly refers to all the various means that viral programs use to
hide themselves.  Specifically, however, it refers to trapping
mechanisms that viral programs use to circumvent detection.  These
mechanisms are only effective once the virus is active in the
computer (referred to as being "active in memory").  The virus will
"trap" calls to read the data on the disk, and present back only the
information of the original, uninfected, program.

The virus is able to do this because very few programs bother to
read or write directly to the disk hardware.  Because of possible
differences in hardware, and also because these functions are
generally fairly standard, manipulation of the disk is left to the
operating system and underlying software and hardware.  The
operating system provides standard addresses which are "system
calls" and "hooks" to the required functions.  When a program wishes
to read data from the disk, it asks the operating system to do it by
"calling" the function from a standard, known address.

However, since the address is known, virus writers can know it as
well.  Code can be inserted at the standard address which redirects
the "call" to code provided by the virus.  This stealth code may
indeed use the original programming provided by the operating
system, but it filters the data returned to the calling program.  If
an infected file is being read, the "infection" simply does not
appear in the information that the "calling" program receives.  Thus
no trace of the virus infection can be found--at least not on disk.

Stealth is a technology, not a virus per se.  There is no one
"stealth" virus:  there are a lot of viral programs which implement
stealth in one form or another.  Stealth is not, in fact, limited to
viral programs.  Antiviral software, and even utilities, use similar
means to avoid compatibility problems with the wide range of
computers and programs now operating.

One ironic aspect of stealth, in viral programs, is "self-
cleaning".  When copies are made of infected programs, the copy
program runs the data through the stealth filter as well.  This
means that copies of an infected program, made while the virus is
active, are clean.  At least initially ...
