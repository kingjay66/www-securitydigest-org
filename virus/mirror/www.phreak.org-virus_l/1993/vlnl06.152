I have been speaking with Kev HARRIS@lib.swbts.edu about info on viruses and
how they work and I told him about a new book I have got hold of.  He
requested more info on it and suggested I post the info to the bulletin board.

So heres the info.

Book;   The Survivors Guide To Computer Viruses
                Edited by Victoria Lammer

isbn no  0-9522114-0-8

Its a book that brings together core info from previous editions of "Virus
Bulletin"
Its the first edition release in september 93 and can be obtained from Virus
Bulletin Ltd in the UK

Email address for more info is VIRUSBTN@VAX.OX.AC.UK

I,m reading the book at present and find the info inside to be interesting
and informative. ( This is IMHO)

Well, the procedures that they have at SizeWell B Power Station
failed as on ALL security gates at the station, there is a BIG blue
sign saying that all PC based disks MUST be checked for virus's before
being allowed onto the site and it provides a phone number that anyone
can call for assistance. Most equipment is searched prior to allowance
on the site ( I am a recent vistor as a contractor to the site ),
allthough I must say, when I went onto the site, I had PC disks with
me, but was never asked about them nor did I offer them up for
site inspection either.

In one respect, there own procedures and other things failed. Signs,
personell and associated items DID not work. Whatever procedures you
have, if they fail to be implemented, then the barriers are useless.

Is this a FAQable item?  I have a terrific program by Yossi Gil
called EVERY.COM, which provides very powerful and testing for
time periods.  For instance, the program supports commands like

every week run.exe
every month run.exe
every year run.exe

as well as

every thursday run.exe

The doc gives no indication of licensing fees, so I'm
assuming the program is freeware.

Subject: Re: Once a week batch file (PC)

There have been several recent postings on the subject of running AV programs
at boot on specific days.  There have also been similar messages on CIS.

Legare Coleman posted a batch file solution on CIS that works with the more
recent DOS versions - those allowing CALL.  (COMMAND /c does not work.)

I have modified his solution to eliminate the need to prepare a second batch
file in advance, and to have the code clean up completely after itself.

Inclusion of these line in AUTOEXEC.BAT will CALL a batch file named
AVBATCH.BAT at (every) bootup on every Tuesday.  Users will need to supply the
AVBATCH file.  This code is easily modified for any day of the week, or
specific fully qualified date.

- -----------------------------cut here----------------------------------------

  echo set dow=%%3>  current.bat
  echo. | date > getdate.bat
  call getdate
  del getdate.bat
  del current.bat
  if "%dow%" == "Tue" call avbatch
  set dow=

- -----------------------------cut here----------------------------------------

Things to watch out for:
        %%3> must be exactly as shown, with 2 '%'s and no space between '3'
        and '>'.  If the day of the week is not the 4th item in the top line
        of the date display, adjust the '3' accordingly.
        'current' must be the first word in the top line of the date display.
        If not, substitute whatever is there.
        'echo.' is whatever is required to echo a CR to the pipe.
        The 'if' test must match the day name wanted, with no extraious
        spaces.
        The last line has no spaces following the '='.

This works because the date text is written to a batch file, the first word of
which is a valid command (because we made a batch file with that name).  When
GETDATE is called it jumps to CURRENT.BAT, passing it the rest of the top line
of the date response as arguments.  CURRENT.BAT then places the 3rd argument
into the environment, where it can be retrieved when CURRENT.BAT terminates
and the CALL returns.

The nature of the bug in Version 107 was that SCAN would allocate
memory to uncompress PKLITE and LZEXE files in and then fail to deallocate
the memory if SCAN did not scan a compressed file before changing to
another directory.  SCAN would then run out of buffer space to read other
files into, report that it required more memory, and return to the DOS
prompt.

	As I had mentioned earlier I have been developing a program to Scan
every "N" days.  The beta is available to anyone who would like me to send it
to you in uuencoded format.

	The program is not restricted to scanning for viruses using one
particular program.  Instead, it can automate several other tasks for you (like
backing up your system).

	If you would like a copy, or have an ftp site I could put the program
on, please send me email (Sliner@tamu.edu), and I will send a copy to you.

Thank you in advance,

Well, I was pointing it out for two reasons --

1) Because the readers of virus-l/comp.virus don't know (they have to
guess) who the self-appointed experts are, in comparison with the real
virus researchers, so hearing it from more than one source would probably
be a reassuring point for them.

2) I was just making it clear in that particular comment block -
because it wasn't.

to run only under the MS-DOS setup, not the WinNT setup.

	How can I get rid of it? I know how to do it in a
plain MS-DOS machine, but this one is running both options,
it has the NT-Loader that asks whether I want MS-DOS or
WinNT loaded.
	I assume that doing sys C: just won't do it....

Subject: Automated virus scanning (PC)

  I read a users message on here that wanted to execute a virus
scanner once per week in his autoexec.bat file.  I don't really
recommend doing this since it's not as good as scanning after
a clean floppy boot, but if you have many "WordPerfect Only" type
people in a office that you manage it could be something that
would get used, and a clean boot wouldn't be.

  Anyways.....  I wrote such a program if anyone wants it.
It takes a weekday as the first parameter, and any command you
want to run after that.  It runs the program once, and only once
on the specified weekday even if you boot more than once on that
day.  It is less than 4k (done in Turbo Pascal) and freeware.
If anyone wants it I can post or email a uuncoded copy to you.

  I can add more features and such if needed, but don't expect
a Windoze version, etc....8-;  I'd start to feel that I was
writting "huge bloated code" if this got over 10k...

You've had chance that you have not used the /A option, otherwise SCAN
108 would have reported a "virus" in one of the files in the
package. This is a false positive, as I already explained in one of my
previous articles.

Damn't! Stupid me... :-( That's entirely my fault, sorry for the
confusion. I'll correct the archive on the ftp site at once.

The name of the file (V_931105.-VB) is correct - this is the latest
update (that's why the 'b' in the name of the archive) and it
indicates the date it has been created (in yymmdd format). No, there
is no switch to indicate which database of virus detection information
to use. However, the name of the database to be used is kept in the
file -V.SET. It is a text file and you can use a text editor to edit
it and put there V_931105.-VB, instead of V_930915.-VB (which is its
current contents).

Once more, sorry for the confusion. Just in case somebody is
interested, here is how it has happened. I received the package by
snail-mail and the update by e-mail. The update archive contained a
correct -V.SET file, but obviously I have messed something up while
merging the two archives.

If you are using the "regular" version (-V.EXE), then the only
solution is to edit the file -V.SET manually. I guess, that's a
misfeature that has to be corrected. However, if you are using the
"professional" version (-VPRO.EXE), you can press F4 from the main
menu. This brings a submenu, called "Base Set" and you can use it to
add or remove virus definition databases that will be used by the
program. You can also edit those databases, unless they are locked
(the ones that come with the package -are- locked, in order to prevent
misuse). The result is that the file -V.SET is updated. Just delete
the old database name and add the new one.

I wouldn't say so. I have very serious problems to make NAV 3.0 run
from a batch file and produce a sensible report.

First of all, it is not possible any more to redirect its standard
output - because it simply does not write to stdout any more.

Second, I had a very annoying problem of NAV stopping after every
infection found and waiting me to press <Enter>. Setting Tools /
Options / Scanner / Advanced / Immediate Notification to OFF takes
care of the problem - but only when you run the program
interactively. For some reasons, it doesn't work from the command
line. That is, the program still stops, regardless that you have
saved that particular option in its OFF status. Eventually, Jimmy
advised me to set Tools / Options / Alerts / Remove Alert Dialog /
After 0 seconds. Now the notification window disappears
automatically, but it still appears (when the program is run from
the command line), slowing down significantly the scanning process
of a heavily infected system (or a virus collection).

BTW, the above description gives some impression of how clumsy is to
change a single option. Worse, it is not possible to change those
options from the command line. You have to start the program
interactively, change the options, exit the program (they get saved
automatically), and then run the program from the command line with
the option settings required for that particular case.

At last, I was unable to produce a report file automatically. There is
a /report option, but it doesn't seem to do anything at all. There is
no way to make the program create a report file while it is working.
The most one can do is to run the program, then when it finishes -
examine the activities log (interactively, from the menus), and select
to print part of it in a file. Clumsy, and inappropriate for automatic
preprocessing of the results. I tend to call such programs "not
suitable for testing".

Ignore the above, it's completely wrong. This virus is an MBR
infector, not a DBS infector. It can be removed with FDISK /MBR, but
NOT with SYS. Sorry if my incorrect advice has caused any confusion
and thanks to the person who spotted the mistake and e-mailed me. Too
bad, it seems that I cannot keep in mind even the basic properties of
the boot sector viruses... :-(( Probably there are too many of them

Version 2.2 is obsolete. The latest one is 2.91. It is able to detect
the virus reliably. However, when I ran it in removal mode (-br), it
said that the virus is removed, but didn't actually touch anything.
Maybe the registered version doesn't have this problem.

Neither can CLEAN 9.20 V109.

There is no such version of NAV. The existing ones are 1.0, 2.0, 2.1,
and 3.0. Version 2.1 (with the latest updates of the virus
definitions) is able to disinfect only the COM files. I was not able
to make version 3.0 to do reliably even that.

> What can I use to get rid of the virus without having to delete the files?

I tested some other programs. Here are the results:

F-Prot 2.10		- disinfects only COM files
FindVirus 6.51		- doesn't disinfect anything
AntiVir IV		- disinfects only COM files
CPAV 2.1		- doesn't disinfect anything
IBM Antivirus/DOS 1.03	- doesn't disinfect anything
AntiVirus Pro 1.07b	- DISINFECTS EVERYTHING
PCVP 1.23		- deletes everything
UTScan 29.04		- doesn't disinfect anything and crashes
VET 7.50		- doesn't disinfect anything

Conclusion: Get AVP 1.07b from our ftp site (beware, it's more than a
meg). It will be able to repair the infected files.

Subject: Strange Behavoiur of F-PROT, possible boot sector virus? (PC)

Hi,
     I am having a small problem with a possible virus on out campus (more
specifically in out engineering PC lab). The problem is isolating the virus
(?). The order of events are something like this:

1)   09:00     Get a report of a virus in the engineering PC lab. The lab is
               closed to all access until we can isolate the problem.

2)   09:30     Have the virus located on one machine in lab and get reports
               from F-PROT 2.09f saying that is the "TELECOM virus" is in
               memory. Only if you boot the machine using the hard drive and
               letting autoexec.bat be run. (loadhigh, mouse, doskey, msav
               and mode only programs in autoexec.bat). If autoexec not run
               virus not seen.

3)   10:00     Find virus on about half of the machines in the lab using F-
               PROT after booting the machines with a full pass of the
               autoexec.bat.

4)   10:15     Discover that only F-PROT will find the virus, MSAV and SCAN
               do not find the virus.

5)   11:00     Get virus to infect a disk with f-prot on the disk. The disk
               will consistently give a hit for the "TELECOM" virus. Cannot
               tell where the virus is because we do not have a duplicate and
               no file sizes or dates were changed.

6)   11:45     Try to get virus to infect another disk that we have made in
               our offices as a duplicate of a master disk. The virus will
               not attack the disk, even though it is still reported in
               memory. We also start to low level format each if the drives
               in the lab (20 machines in all)

7)   13:15     After trying for over hour an to get virus to act
	       consistently, virus seems to disappear from the infected
	       F-Prot disk even though it is write protected.

8)   13:45     Get the original disk that was used to do the scanning and
               find that it has been modified by Central Point Anti-Virus to
               have external self checking code. All disks scanned with this
               disk give gibberish lines such as follows when scanning the
               boot sector:
Rn NCI brnmnirrrnrrrt,arrai-ars]/nha t virus-infected right now (Y/N) ?

9)   14:20     Gather all disk used to try to disinfect the lab. Boot and
               scan each disk, all report clean. The one machine in the lab
               that we have not reformatted still reports the TELECOM virus
               when msav is run.

10)  15:00     For the sake of our collective sanity, we stop trying to find
               the virus to sit back and reflect on what has happened.

11)  16:00     Show disk that virus had looked like it had left to the person
               who had initially isolated the virus. And the virus was back
               with more gibberish than before. And will not give a hit for
	       TELECOM virus.

     As part of trying to figure out what happened I decided to write this
note and try to see if any of you have any suggestions as to what we could do
next?
     Have we been chasing a non-virus conflict between MSAV and F-PROT?
     Is there any other way to rid ourselves of this virus besides
reformatting all of the hard drives on campus?

Hi all,

Here is the *official* answer from Frans Veldman (author of TBAV) about the
danger of using TbClean (esp. the heuristic cleaning) and the so called
'dangerous' virus "Varicella".
These is no danger (at least not since the release of 6.02 or so)
and there never really was !!

Heuristic scanning? Heuristic cleaning you mean! There is absolutely nothing
dangerous with heuristic *scanning*.

TbClean will normally use the Anti-Vir.Dat records, which do not pose any
risk at all. Heuristic cleaning will only be performed as a last resort,
if all other means to clean a file failed, mainly because the user
neglected to use TbSetup. If you apply our tools correctly, there is and
has never been any danger.

If you don't like it, simply disable the heuristic cleaning feature of
TbClean.

??? How do you mean 'Too high'? According to what standard? The default
heuristic mode of TbScan does not cause any false alarm.

> perfected!

Heuristic is already perfect. It detects about 90% of the new viruses.
This means that 9 out of 10 completely new viruses are detected before
we, the authors of TBAV, even have seen the virus.

Anyway, to your information, the Varicella virus isn't able to escape from
TbClean anymore since the last four releases.

As a former system/network admin I have to say there is NOTHING simple
about having users back their data up to a server.  Often servers (DOS,
OS/2 and Unix are the ones I'm familiar with) are carefully partitioned to
make certain that *all* users have proper access and space availability.
If someone suddenly decides to dump about 30-60 Mb of data and programs (I
don't have any faith at all that people won't decide to back up their
program files "just in case") onto a server which is already at maximum
usage it can cause all kinds of nightmares for the administrator.  In
addition, a simple request to the adminstrator will often result in extra
help in handling the backup.  Trust me, there is a reason for system
operators and admins to limit use and access.  Come to think of it, I'm sure
*I* spent alot more time being yelled AT than yelling at someone else.  Oh,
and one final point, your admin should *definitely* be told if your
workstation is infected as part of your system security.

You're right that you can never have too many good backups.  However,
before you back up onto a server you need to check the policy that has
been set by your company/school/administrator.  Otherwise, you might find
that the data you thought you had carefully and securely backed up onto
the server was deleted by your adminstrator.

BEGPAN5.CVP  931103

                         Getting Resources

There are probably a number of things around you that you can use
either to diagnose the problem or to aid in recovery.  We've looked
at some of the basic information, resources and history that might
help.  Now, let's look for some tools which might be less obvious.

Another computer is a big help, particularly if you are pretty sure
it hasn't been infected or affected.  If you have several, that can
be a real big help.  Another computer can be used to examine
(carefully) floppy disks and files from the infected machine, to try
and determine what is being infected, and how.  If you don't have a
"clean system disk", that pre-requisite for any virus disinfection,
you can make one from the other computer.

You may be able to confirm or deny a virus infection with the other
machines.  If you suspect a virus simply on the basis that
"something weird is happening," then you probably don't have a virus
at all.  Computers do many strange and wonderful things, only very
few of them at the behest of viral programs.  In any event,
"swapping out" bits and pieces of the computers may identify some
malfunctioning hardware.  You still have a problem, but at least it
is an isolated and identifiable one.

Along with whatever system and utility software you can find, get
several blank, formatted disks.  Make some of them system disks.
Copy a range of programs on to them, of different types and sizes.
These disks and files you will want to use as bait.  (If the
infected computer uses different types and sizes of disks, get
examples of all the various formats.)  Record the file sizes and
dates of the "bait" files, as well as the "free space" remaining on
the disk.  (Viral programs may use various means to hide the fact
that a file has grown.  Few, however, bother to try to hide the fact
that disk space has shrunk.)  Take a look at the boot sectors of the
disks so that you will be able to notice any changes if they are
changed.

Get a pot of coffee.  Get a few friends, even if computer
illiterate, for the moral support and the extra eyes.  (Observations
are key.)  Get some lunch.  Get some perspective.  Don't Panic.
