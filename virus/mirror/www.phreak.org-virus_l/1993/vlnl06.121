Certainly a strange letter, and I'm not in the least surprised at your
concern.

However, as foar as I know, Cheyenne is legitimate.  They make an antiviral
called InocuLAN (which I have, but haven't gotten around to reviewing yet).
The contact numbers I have for them are 800-243-9462 and 516-484-5110.

I help maintain an ethertalk and localtalk Mac network which is about to "go
Novelle".  I  wanted to know are there any viruses that will go from the
Novelle system to the mac?
And which ones should i be on the look out for on this new mixed platform??

I also wanted to know if Disinfectant had been upgraded since 3.2

Thanks a million in advance

There are no known viruses that affect both Macintosh and DOS workstations,
so that's not something you need to worry about.  What you DO need to watch
out for is the fact that your Novell server(s) will look just like
AppleShare servers to the Macintosh workstations.  As a result, Macintosh
applications that reside on the servers can be infected unless you make
certain that applications are stored in read-only directories.  (This is
always a good idea for file servers.)  Applications on the servers that are
ALREADY infected can, of course, also spread the infection to the
workstations.

What's the gist of all this?  Basically, you have to worry about the same
issues with a Novell server being accessed by Macs as with an AppleShare
server being accessed by Macs.  Careful management will prevent most
problems.

> I also wanted to know if Disinfectant had been upgraded since 3.2

Disinfectant 3.2 is the latest version.  I believe Gatekeeper was the last
Macintosh antiviral to be updated; it is now at version 1.2.8.

We ran into this problem about two years ago (and, I think discussed it
here quite extensively) but maybe it is time to rehash.

I am going to use SCAN as an example here because I know the necessary
syntax though any scanner that detects the virus in memory and returns an
ERRORLEVEL can be used.

The technique is like this (note: valid only on true client-server networks.
If you have a peer-peer system IMHO you have little hope):

1) Take down the server and restore infected programs from uninfected
   backups. (Last time I didi it was between 2 and 4 am one night)
2) Make all files in the login script process execute only and put
   SCAN.EXE in the same directory (also execute only)
3) Add the line "SCAN NUL /M" to the login script and follow with a
   line like "IF ERRORLEVEL 1 GOTO VIRUS"
4) Under VIRUS add lines that will identify the client, send a message to
   both client and administator, and then locks the client machine up.
   (eg ":self   goto self"  is effective)

This will identify infected clients and deny tham the ability to infect
your system. I have used it sucessfully on hundreds of Novell networks.

The users are going to complain about the added time it takes to login.
Tough. (If you do not have this level of control over the network, you
have other problems).

The first time I ran into this situation ("Oh we can't take the server down,
we'll lose xxx million dollars a day..."), I used a little file called
Canary that just checksummed itself and returned a non-zero errorlevel
on failure. Effective for Jerusalem and Sunday but useless against "stealth".
Just copied a fresh one into a R/W directory for each user. Fast and
effective at the time but not a global solution today.

"SCAN NUL /M" or any other effective scanner with this ability is better
and will handle your problem though a "1991" solution and not a "state
of the art" one since it can detect an infection only *after* it has
happened.

Real integrity management on every client and verified/updated from the
server is best since "unknown" viruses are detectable and does not have to
involve any lengthy scans - even just of memory. My stuff is designed to
prevent the infection in the first place as are products like McAfee's
VShield/Chkshld, Frisk's resident driver, Dr. Panda's BEARTRAP, and several
others, yet no one seems to use these. IMHO it is way past the time for
effective layered control of viruses.

Subject: Stone virus problem. (PC)

    I have encountered a standard stone virus on hard drive.  The
drive is divided into two logical partitions.  F-Prot v2.09 detected
the virus.  It was removed from the first partition, but F-prot v2.09
can not remove it from the second partition.  It states that the MBR
can not be found be found on the second drive (Drive D:).  I run SCAN
9.17 v106 and there is no sign of the virus detected on any drive.  I
did not find any signs of the virus active at boot time.  Any
sugestions as to how to clean the second partition.  What ever help
can be suggested will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advanced.

Subject: disabling BIOS floppy boot good boot sector protection? (PC)

Hello in virusland. I'm a relative newcomer to this group (2-3 weeks), but
have read the FAQ and have followed the group for a bit.

On my new computer, the BIOS setup allows for booting from floppies to be
disabled. Since I would normally only boot from a floppy if something were
wrong with the hard disk and/or to check the hard disk for infection, this
seems like a good way to protect against a floppy-transmitted boot sector
infector. If booting from a floppy is necessary, the BIOS setup could easily
be turned back on. Does this make sense, or am I just being naive.

A related question:
I have a friend who got infected by a boot sector virus and claims the
machine was _never_ booted with the infected floppy in the machine. I don't
see how this is possible. I suspect it actually happened but he just doesn't
remember it. Is it possible?

BTW, I am running SCAN 106 , duly institutionally licensed, at work and will
be using F-Prot 2.09d at home.

Thanks.

SVC is a resident file infector. I would suggest for you to send copies to
Frisk and Aryeh.

If you can not wait for a removal routine for the virus. cold boot (turn off
the computer, and reboot a few seconds later) from a known clean write
protected bootable diskette, then scan the work stations with F-Prot or Scan
107 from a known clean diskettes. Delete the infected files, and restore
those files from backup or original diskettes. Re-boot the work station, and
move to the next.

Hope this helps.

Subject: Problems with Scan107. (PC)

Dear Netters,

Hopefully someone can shed some light onto the problem I've run into.

I ftp'ed down a copy of scanv107.zip from mcafee.com.  Unzipped the file
and tried scanning my 150Mb hard-disk.  (The options I used are below)

Scan C: /m /a /chkhi

This should result in the C drive being scanned with memory scanned upto
the 1088k area.  Also all files should be scanned.

This works fine until I get into my C:\DOS directory, where an error occurs.

The program aborts and reports that it needs 390k more RAM.  This is quite
strange because before running the program it has 586k out of a possible
640k convential memory free.

Has anyone else suffered anything similar to this....and if so how did they
get it up and running?  I have posted to support@mcafee.com but I am still
waiting for an answer (could take a while I guess).

I re-ran my scan106 without a hitch and it reported no viruses even with the
new version of scan, however I would like to get the newer version running.
Could this just be a bug-ridden version?

Please Email me at the address below as I do not read all the newsgroups
this letter has been posted to.  Any tips or help would be most appreciated.

FYI: 	Running MS-DOS 6.0, Stacker 3.1.
	Convential memory free: 586k
	Also running NDOS.COM (a COMMAND.COM replacement) which come from
	Norton Utilites 7.01.

Regards,

Matt.

Even better, unzip the files, scan them, and delete the unzipped files,
keeping the original ZIP file.
Why? Because this way there is absolutely no chance to *add* a virus to
the files. That might happen, if the packed files were OK, but your machine
was infected (with a brand-new virus that SCAN didn't find, or a stealth-
virus active in memory, or ...). Granted, it's not a probable scenario,
but it is possible.
Keeping the original archives unchanged is always a bit safer than repacking
them. Besides, you save the time needed to repack.

Yes there is a problem with version 107 of Vshield and McAfee is
looking into it. Also Scan v107 has a problem when doing a lot of
scanning, ie. you entire hard disk. Scan will indicate that it
requires more memory about 390K even though you may have more than

.and when all else fails, try adding this line to your CONFIG.SYS:

  drivparm=/d:{drive number} /c /f:{drive type}

 where {drive number} can be: 0 = drive A
                              1 = drive B
                              2 = drive C    and so forth

 You'll especially need the '/c' to enable disk drive change-line support.

 {drive type} can be: 0 = 160/180/320/360KB   1 = 1.2MB
                      5 = Hard Disk           6 = Tape
                      7 = 1.44MB              8 = Read/write optical disk
                      9 = 2.88MB

 Issuing the CHKDSK A:  command before DIR A:  also forces DOS to read
 the drive properly.

Subject: More on the strange strain... (PC)

Hi gang.  I was testing the virus I found the other day.
It infects COM and EXE files by attatching itself at the end of the
files and changing the initial JMP instruction to point to itself.

The virus hides the file size change when active in memory.  Once it is
resident, it hooks interrupts 8, 13h and 21h, and steals 2960 bytes from
the top of RAM.  On files, the virus appends 2936 bytes on COMs and
EXEs, with its code.

VSumX307 does not give me a clew about which one this virus is.  There is
no virus in the Length Reference whose size is exactly 2936 bytes.

Anyway, I'll send the copy to Frisk and Aryeh by private e-mail.

Subject: Can TT font files be infected? (PC)

The problem came to my mind by a recent question in this group,
where somebody had a possibly infected file 'pcplus.fon'.
Since True Type fonts begin with the 'Mark Zbikowski'
magic number, a virus could think they are executables
and attach itself to them.
The questions is now:
 Does this happen?
 If it happens, is it important (i.e. are
  fonts executed by MS Windows or only treated
  as data)?
 If both is true, do scanners take care of that fact?

The same problem is represented by many other
files (particularly in MS Windows) too,
I just remember that the screensavers are renamed
executables.

it was also 'slipped' into  various  networks (fidonet,etc.) as a
uuencoded message. i would suggest anyone receiving a copy of this

it did not go resident with your test. are you sure that
upon subsequent executions it may go resident without permission?
i am asking because some users may read what you said here, and assume it
to be the case, that it -WILL NOT GO RESIDENT-. in the event that it
may in deed go resident on the fourth or fifth execution, or, in the
event there are soon similar viruses (such as i just described), for my
peace of mind, i'd like to know if someone has actually examined it to
ascertain it -will not EVER-, not just in x number of executions.

i have not examined it.

did you attempt this on various types of files?
if i recall correctly, the original cruncher would render some programs
unusable, particularly programs that used self checking functions, and
some overlays.

>Since this requests permission, it shouldn't really be called a virus. I am

in my opinion, it does not matter if it requests permission or not.
there are other viruses that 'request permission'. ; and asking
permission is not , as far as i know, a prerequisite for determining
the behaviour of a program 'virus'.

>This thing attaches to .COM and .EXE files, but ignores COMMAND.COM.

the original cruncher would ignore all files beginning with certain
two letter pairs: CO, VS, HT, TB, RA and several others. this would
explain ignoring command.com, if it has not been changed. does it
(the new one) contain the same 'to be avoided' strings as the old one?

i might suggest you send a copy to fred cohen :) it was mentioned he was
interested in the original, which i sent to him via post mail. (he
said he preferred this to email, if he's watching, i never did hear if he
got the virus :). the original contained greetings to him, and the author
of the original mentioned he would like it passed along to fred, so i
did. he may be interested in the followup; by the way, does the follow-up
contain text to indicate it is a new version, or is it just updated
by the inclusion of a 'permission' routine?

Subject: F-PROT & Blinker virus (PC)

Does anyone out there have any experience with F-Prot and the "Blinker"
virus. I recently had a comm utility quit while I was running it and I
received the message"- Message Blinker: Fatal runtime error 1211".

I don't know if that is an F-Prot warning, an error message from my comm
program or a DOS warning. The only reasons I have to suspect that it's a
virus is there is a virus named Blinker, and that I'm having general
problems with my system.

I ran F-Prot in Security and in Heuristic and both scans came up clean,
as did MS DOS Vscan.

Any help or advice would be most sincerely appreciated

 I know this has probably been discussed many times, but does
Microsoft anti-virus say that Michelangelo is always present when
McAfee and Norton don't.  Is there a patch out there via ftp at
mcafee.com or somewhere?

Subject: Q: Chinese Fish (PC)

A friend of mine detected a virus that F-PROT 2.09 identified as
"Chinese Fish". (It was on a floppy of a big German PD-Distribution
company).

But F-PPROT's virus information does not tell anything about this
virus.  So, what is it? Is it a harmful virus, and what's the best way
to disinfect?

Thanks,
Matthias

Hi All! I just started testing TBAV 6.05 in one of my systems and
I'm having the following problem: I use 4DOS/MSDOS 6.0/QEMM 7.01
combo and when I run Desqview and try to open a Qmodem window
TBSCANX gives this message: "DV.COM tries to trace through the DOS
int 21h code. Viruses do this to bypass anti-virus software! Reboot? (Y/N)"
It then locks up no matter which options I use in my autoexec.bat,
can anyone tell me how to fix this problem? Presently I use the command
TBSCANX A L in my autoxec and I just disable it before going into
desqview, but there must be some other way to fix it. Any1 suggestions?
Thanks!

"Difficult" is not the right term in this case, as there is
no definition to the amount of difficulty. Viruses CAN propagate via networks
only if one user can see and use what another user did! Sharing executable
files (that are not ReadOnly, and if the user does not have rights to change
that status) is the perfect way to infect everyone.

One more thing: there is a way (used by the NetCrasher
virus) to allocate memory on the server from a simple station, this will
result in crashing the server, but the virus does not propagate this way.

If you look at the collection of VIRUS_L_DIGEST, somewhere you'll find a lot
of letters on the subject. Give it a try...

September 4, 1993 1000 PDT                                       Number D-22
__________________________________________________________________________
NAME:         Satan Bug virus
PLATFORM:     MS-DOS/PC-DOS Computers
TYPE:         Memory resident, polymorphic, encrypted
DAMAGE:       Infects .COM, .EXE, .SYS, and .OVL files. Damages infected
              files, makes LANs inaccessible by damaging the LAN drivers.
SYMPTOMS:     Files grow at each infection, file dates change, files on LAN
              file servers become inaccessible.
DETECTION:    DataPhysician Plus 4.0D, Scan V106, Norton AntiVirus 2.1 with
              August 1993 virus definitions.
__________________________________________________________________________
              Critical Facts about the Satan Bug Virus

CIAC has been alerted that the Satan Bug virus, a new virus previously thought
to be contained, has been located at multiple sites in the "wild." The Satan
Bug virus is an encrypted, polymorphic virus that infects all .COM, .EXE,
SYS, and .OVL files on MS-DOS/PC-DOS computers.

Infection Mechanism

When an infected file is run, the virus installs itself in memory, and then
infects COMMAND.COM. Thereafter, whenever an executable file is opened or
executed it is infected with the virus. Infected files grow in size from 2.9K
to 5.4K bytes, and the creation date is increased by 100 years.

Potential Damage

It does not appear that this virus does any intentional damage, but infected
files may be inoperative. In addition, the virus is not easily removed from
infected files, requiring that they be replaced with uninfected copies from
backup disks (See Appendix). The virus damages network drivers, making it
impossible for a machine to connect to a network and use network services.

Detection

Anti-virus scanners dated before August 1993 that use virus signature scanning
will not be able to recognize this virus. Anti-virus scanners that use file
signature scanning should be able to detect that the files have been changed,
but will not be able to name the virus. Most anti-virus scanner vendors are
updating their programs at this time, so scanners dated after August 1993
should be able to detect the virus by name. As of the release of this
bulletin, McAfee's SCANV 106 and Norton AntiVirus version 2.1 with the August
1993 virus definitions update are known to detect it. The DataPhysician Plus
package (VirHunt, ResScan) version 4.0D is in final testing and will be
available soon.

    Warning

If you run an infected anti-virus scanner, nearly every executable file on
your disk will be infected. Virus scanners must open a file to scan it, and if
this virus is in memory, the act of opening the file for scanning will infect
it. Most scanners first check themselves to see if they are infected with a
virus, and display a "Virus Found" or "File Damaged" message when they start
up. If this happens, do not scan your disk with this scanner. Even if the
scanner claims that it can remove the virus from itself, don't scan your disk
with it. The memory resident portion of the virus will still infect your disk.

To scan a computer infected with a memory resident virus like the Satan Bug
virus, you must boot the computer with a clean (uninfected), locked floppy
that contains a clean version of the virus scanner software. Delete any
infected files the scanner finds, and replace them with fresh copies. See the
Appendix for more information.

Appendix - Scanners, Encrypted Viruses and Removing Memory Resident Viruses

The following appendix answers some frequently asked questions about virus
scanners, encrypted viruses, and disinfecting hard disks.

Anti-Virus Scanners

Virus scanners use two different methods for detecting infected files;
scanning for virus signatures, and scanning for changes in executable files. A
signature scanner must have a string of bytes or signature that it can detect
in a file that uniquely identifies a virus. If a virus does not contain a
known signature, then the scanner will not detect it. File scanners look at a
files attributes, creation date and time, length, checksum, file header, and
other properties to determine if a file has changed. A file scanner can detect
a new virus, but can not tell what virus it is. Actually, a file scanner can
not tell if a file is infected by a virus only that a file has changed in some
way. However, any changes in executable files should be viewed with a lot of
suspicion. Few executable files rewrite themselves after installation. None of
the DOS utility programs (FORMAT, ASSIGN, etc.) should ever change during
normal use, so view changes there as a probable virus infection.

Problems Removing Encrypted Viruses

Encrypted viruses like the Satan Bug are particularly difficult to remove from
an infected program. Most viruses of this type attach themselves to the end of
a program, and then remove a small piece from the beginning of the program and
insert code there that causes the virus code to be run first. When the virus
code completes running, it executes the small piece of code it removed from
the beginning of the program and then continues with the original program.
That way, when you run an infected program, you will only notice a slight
hesitation at the beginning when the virus code runs, and then the infected
program runs like normal.

Encrypted viruses store this piece of the normal program within the virus code
and then encrypt the virus code. For an anti-virus program to be able to patch
an infected program, it must be able to decrypt the encrypted virus to find
the piece of missing code so that it can be put back where it belongs. The
Satan Bug virus has up to nine levels of encryption, the level being different
for each infection. Decrypting this much code is a very difficult process, so
most anti-virus programs are not expected to be able to repair programs
infected with the Satan Bug virus.

On the other hand, some file signature scanning programs may save enough of
the scanned files to be able to repair an infected program. The Data Physician
Plus package does save a sufficient amount of information to be able to repair
a program infected with the Satan Bug virus. However, you must have created
the file signature file before your program was infected. Again, if at all
possible, you should always replace infected files rather than repairing them
to insure that you have undamaged copies.

Disinfecting Hard Disks Infected With a Memory Resident Program Virus

In order to disinfect a disk infected with a memory resident program virus,
you first need to get the virus out of memory, then you need to scan the disk
with an uninfected copy of the Virus Scanner. To get the virus out of memory,
boot your computer with a clean, locked boot disk. Then you can scan the hard
disk using an anti-virus scanner, also located on a locked disk. The following
steps can be used to disinfect systems infected with memory resident program
viruses such as the Satan Bug. It is also applicable to non-memory resident
program viruses, but is not applicable to boot sector viruses and partition
table viruses which need additional steps.

    1. You need a locked, uninfected emergency boot floppy disk that contains
       the virus scanner, FORMAT.EXE, SYS.COM, and FDISK.COM, any disk
       management software needed to access your hard disk such as
       DiskManager. You also need simple CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files
       that let you bring up your system in a limited way, and any
       backup/restore software you may use. You need to have made this disk
       before your system gets infected, or make it on some other uninfected
       machine.
    2. Boot the infected computer with the locked, uninfected floppy.
    3. Run the copy of the virus scanner on the uninfected floppy and scan the
       hard disks on the infected computer.
    4. Once the scan has completed, delete any infected files the scanner
       found and scan the disk again. Repeat this step until no more infected
       or changed files are found. Alternately, you can let the scanner
       disinfect all the files if it can, but this is not always possible
       or preferable.
    5. When the scanner indicates that the hard disk is clean: Restore the
       system using the SYS command. This step replaces the invisible system
       files, COMMAND.COM, and the boot sector.
    6. Restore any deleted executables from your locked master disks
       or backup sets.
    7. Scan the disk again with your virus scanner. Note that at this point,
       the scanner may detect changes in some files because you have copied in
       new versions. If the scanner detects a virus, then delete the infected
       file. Later you will need to scan your source disk for that infected
       file, to see if it is infected as well.
    8. Remove the emergency floppy and reboot the computer. Your computer
       should boot up correctly.
    9. Insert the emergency floppy and run the scanner again just to be sure
       you have gotten every infected file.
   10. Start scanning any floppy disks that may have been infected by your
       computer. Keep in mind that the virus could have been active for months
       before you discovered it.

Subject: Polymorphism and variations (CVP)

DEFGENA.CVP   930819

                    Polymorphism and variations

The latest development is the polymorphic "engine".  This is not a
virus as such, but code which can be added to *any* virus in order
to make it polymorphic.  The most widely known of these is the
"Mutating Engine", known as MtE, written by the virus writer who
identifies himself as the Dark Avenger.  There *is* no MtE (or DAME:
Dark Avenger's Mutating Engine) virus; only other viri which have
had the code attached.  MtE is not the only such program around,
many others have been developed such as the more recent model known
as TPE (Trident Polymorphic Engine).  (vx groups tend to have as
little imagination in naming as in programming.)

The polymorphic engines are sometimes confused with "virus kits".
The polymorphic engine, if properly attached to the original virus,
will "reform" the viral code on each new infection.  A virus kit is
a program to automate the actual writing of a virus.  The user picks
characteristics from a menu of choices, and the kit program sticks
together pre-programmed pieces of code to make a virus for you.  A
polymorphic engine, then, is code added to a virus to make the same
virus change its appearance each time it reproduces.  A virus kit is
a non-replicating, non-viral program which automates the process of
generating viral programs each with different characteristics.
Unless polymorphism is one of the options chosen, viral programs
produced by a kit will retain their signatures from that point on.

Fortunately, polymorphism, in whatever form and at whatever level,
has not been a significant threat.  Polymorphs are still easily
detected by change detection and activity monitoring software.  Even
scanners have not had great difficulty dealing with polymorphic
programs.  The early self-encrypting programs generally left readily
identifiable signatures since the decryption code had to be left "en
clair".  Even those programs which performed significant encryption,
or used different encryption routines, generally had few forms which
could be readily identified.  The latter polymorphs are marginally
more difficult to identify but algorithmic, as opposed to pure
signature, scanning is having reasonable success.  Indeed, in the
case of the polymorphic engines, these codes have sometimes been a
boon to the antiviral researcher.  When you can identify the MtE
code, you can also identify, at least as a virus, every new virus to
which it is attached.
