Subject: A non-errant magazine article

May 1993 _IEEE Spectrum_ has a cover article on computer viruses, and
_surprise_ it's something solid and worthwhile:

J. O. Kephart, S. R. White, and D. M. Chess, "Epidemiology of Computer
Viruses", _IEEE Spectrum_ v 30 n 5 (May 1993) pp. 20-26.

I haven't finished reading it yet, but you will all find it
interesting.

I have left a message for my librarian to find out if we can order
offprints -- otherwise I will have her track down a color copier and
pay IEEE the $3.00 for a few copies. It would be a shame to turn such
a well-produced article into grayscale.

I apologise to all for the busy nature of this message, but it is one
that I think is important.
 
Here is how you can virus-proof a pc that has MFM or RLL disk drives
(st-506).  Basically, you can add a write protect switch for one of the
two disks (I recommend C:) and put all your executables on it, along
with dos.  It's very simple, almost anyone can do it.  This is it:
                           _                                           _
 =============|           | |                                         | |
 Controller   |===========| |=========================================| |
              |           | |           .XX   cut wire 6   XX.        | |
             1|===========|1|===========|====================|========|1|
 =============|   /^\     |_|           |                    |        |_|
                   |    Drive D:        |                    |    Drive C:
34 Pin Hard Disk   |     Conn.          |                    |     Conn.
Ribbon Cable  _____|                    |                    |
                                        |__________o/o_______|
                                                 Switch
                                                 Open=Protected
                                                 Closed=Unsafe
 
Okay, here's what's going on.  We have interrupted pin 6, which is
writegate.  Leave the terminator resistors in on both drives, and make
sure both sets are in or you will blow the data on drive C:.  What I
suggest is you use the keyboard lock key switch on the front of most
pc's.  The little lock icon is correct.  With the switch in the lock
position, all writes to C: will be ignored, without any error or warning
message.  With the switch in the unlock position, the system will behave
normally.  You must look at the motherboard and jumper the connector
that the switch used to go to, usually this can be done with a 0.1"
shunt like is used to set unit ID on many disk drives.
 
Or if you wish, you can drill a hole in your case and install a switch
or key interlock or whatever.  You could also use the turbo switch.  I
like the key switch because it's more idiot resistant.
 
Wire 1 on the ribbon cable has a red stripe on it, and you just count
wires to wire 6.  You obviously need to solder extension wires to reach
the switch.  Don't make them over 2 feet long, though.  The shorter the
better.
 
With the switch in the locked position, you are completely immune to
boot sector viruses, and file infectors who try to infect executables on
drive c:.  Since this solution is 100% hardware, there is no way that a
present or future virus can get past it.
 
This technique is ideally suited to virus researchers, and university
"data slut" computing center machines.  This way, the dos, networking
code, compilers, and word processing software could stay intact on a
machine.  The students would be directed to place their data on drive D:
Only the facility director would have the unlock key.
 
For the techie: it doesn't hurt to doubly terminate the st506 control
bus.  The margins are sufficient to make it reliable.  If it bugs you,
use an ohmmeter to figure out which terminator pin is wire 6 on the
34 pin cable, and clip off all other terminator pins on drive C:.
 
If you need help, I am available to help within reason.
 
(Someone onced asked me for more techie detail, so here was my 
reply:)

Okay, here's the scoop.  The WrtGate- signal is a negative-true open
collector signal that is asserted by the disk controller when it wants
the data signal written on the disk.  The line is pulled to about 3
volts by a terminator resistor pack usually positioned on the last disk
drive (in reality, most people leave the pack in on both drives).  3
volts is higher than the TTL threshold for low signals, thus when it is
hanging around at 3 volts, the signal is de-aserted, ie, we are not
writing to the disk.  The disk controller activates its open collector
driver on WrtGate- when it desires a write to take place, which drives
the signal below the TTL threshold of 0.8 volts, which is a logic low,
which means that the term is asserted.
 
Now, my idea is to interrupt the WrtGate- signal.  It is important that
(a) the WrtGate- signal works on the non-protected drive and (b) the
WrtGate- signal remains de-asserted on the protected drive.  If we fail
to have the terminator on the non-protected drive, the WrtGate- signal
will not be reliably pulled up to a logic high, and might oscillate,
causing sporatic data to be written (scribbled) on the disk.  Similarly,
no terminator on the protected drive will cause scribbles on it, which,
by the way, will blow the low level format.
 
By the book, the correct way to do this is to put the terminators on the
protected drive, and put in only a single terminator pin on the WrtGate-
signal on the non-protected drive.  However, doubly terminating these
signals doesn't hurt anything.  I have proven this using special test
fixtures.  I figured that most people do not have the hardware
background to determine, on their particular hard disk, which pin on
which terminator is WrtGate-, remembering that one must clip off the
other pins except for power and ground.  There are too many chances for
error here, unless one does this kind of thing for a living.  Thus, its
simpler and safer just to leave both terminators in.
 

I have heard a reasonable objection that many programs build temporary
swapper files in the directory that the program was executed from, and
this would be a disaster if the drive was protected.  I understand that
ms-dos pipe commands do this as well (haven't verified this.)
Poorly behaved programs would have to be exiled to the permanently
unprotected disk, as punishment for their sins.  We then track down the
offending programmers and kill them.  Like lawyers, the world has too
many programmers anyway.  A few dozen, more or less, surely wouldn't be
missed!

I get the sense that this thing is getting blown out of proportion,
(a storm in a tea cup, as we English would say).

To get things in proportion:
At your (Radia's) "recommendation", I obtained the 80xxx forum snippets
(80x0393.zip), which includes Inbar's article.

As you are probably aware, but have omitted to mention, there is another
file called antianti.txt by Michael Forrest. One by one, it takes apart
Inbar's techniques, and literally "shoots them down" as being of no use
whatsoever for any modern debugger, that is, all but one, which he then
gives details on defeating.

If Inbar is guilty of anything, it is maybe of a slightly inflated ego
(something we are all guilty of, from time to time), which I'm sure was
slightly more inflated by your "accusations"!

Subject: Dr. Popp Convicted

Hello everyone.

Some of you may have missed the news about the conviction of Dr Popp.
The acknowledged perpetrator of the AIDS diskette scam was convicted
of extortion few weeks ago by a court in Rome, Italy. He was tried under
the charge of attempted extortion, and was sentenced two-and-a-half
year arrest. He has not shown up at the trial, though; as far as
I know he is presently living in Lake Jackson, Texas, blissfully
oblivious of the consequences of his act.

There are approximately fifty more cases against Popp that have been
filed at several local courts. As for the Rome sentence, the deadline for
appeal has almost elapsed; should Dr Popp fail to appeal, a request for
an international warrant will be filed with Interpol by the Italian
Police, as Mr. Maurizio Vallone of the "Nucleo Centrale per la
Criminalita'
Informatica" (the Italian Computer Crime Unit) has stated.

Some good news, sometimes.

Subject: Write Protecting Harddrives (add on HW/SW)

>write protecting old harddrives (ones without a write protect switch).

How old is "old"?  If you mean slightly old, like IDE drives, 
then hardware protection is complex.  None of the hardware cards 
meets my needs, as you can't just switche write protect off or on 
at will.  

However if you mean really old, as in ST605(?) it's easy; just 
get a DPDT (double pole double throw) toggle switch, carefully 
cut lines 6 & 12 (Write & Error) in the drive cable, and connect 
as shown below.  You need a soldering iron, a steady hand & some 
experience, so ask your technician if lacking these.  

Most clones sense the error so you get a critical error message 
when anything tries to write to  drive C.  (Many viruses don't 
think a write error is possible on drive C, so don't trap crit 
errors when they try to infect BS, command.com, etc.)  Hoever 
early IBM XTs & exact copies don't check the error line, so you 
can happily write to drive C, unaware that nothing is being 
written.  We have this problem, & frequently panick when someone 
tries to install VET with drive write protected, & it appears to 
crash, or we clean up an infected BS, & reboot, only to have the 
virus reappear.

That technique needs a lot of memory. A hash table for > 2000 signatures may 
not be too small in order to fit them in without too many collisions. So we 
may have to use EMS/XMS utilizing scanners next time.

So long as the BIOS controls disk access, this seems to be true on the 
machines that I have tested. However some devices (like hardcards)
have their own BIOS extenders. On a Zenith with a +4 hardcard you set the
CMOS to "no hard disk" but the controller still finds it. However this
is a quibble.

>Can a virus affect the C: drive if there is no partition to link

Viruses that act at the BIOS level (commonly called MBR infectors such
as STONED) affect the physical disk (80) not the logical one (C:). Without
a partition to define the logical drives, C: will not exist.

Subject: F-Prot 2.08 and 2.07 with CP/DOS6 VSAFE (PC)

Dear Fridrik,

I sent to you yesterday by snail mail 2 problems. One of which was not
possible for me to solve, the second I have now done so.

VSAFE when loaded in one configuration will trigger F-Prot 2.07 and
2.08 to say that the Stoned virus is in the memory when it is run. It
all depends on how VSAFE is loaded into memory as to whether it
triggers F-Prot. On loading F-Prot (not Virstop) the memory scan
"finds" it.

To trigger the false alarm you need the following lines in a
config.sys file:

    Device=himem.sys
    Device=emm386 noems

And in the autoexec bat file, a simple:

    vsafe

This loads vsafe in two portions, 23k in conventional memory, and 23k
in xms. Other combinations (7k conventional, 33k EMS, or even 46k in
conventional memory) do *NOT* trigger the false alarm. It has been
tested with 5 computers, running DOS 5 and DOS 6. Vsafe that comes
with DOS 6 does trigger it, as does the VSAFE that comes with PC
Tools.

I have not had chance to check F-Prot 2.08a yet, though I would guess
the problem is still there.

We tried every combination of device drivers and memory settings to
solve the mystery, and that is the combination of switches and
drivers I use for windows.

I hope this is of help. I will send a copy of this to Virus-L. If lots
of people are loading up DOS 6 and getting the message, I'd guess you
might be quite busy. Yours is not the only scanner to display a
similar message, Bates Anti Virus does too, though it at random
chooses from Beijing, Swedish Disaster, Telefonica and others.

Yours,

I don't know if Amir is trying to trap you but...

Vesselin, be careful how you answer this question.  "Infected" is an
adjective.  The answer you provide relates to: "Can I infect a write
protected floppy?"  However, that's a different question.  The answer
to the question as stated above is, "Yes."

The proof is, I infect a floppy, write-protect it, hand it to you.  So
"can a write protected floppy be infected?"  Sure!  You'd be holding one.

I have encountered an odd interaction between virstop.exe version
2.08a and dos 6's memmaker. Specifically, having virstop running 
(either in conventional or high memory) will hang the pc when using
memmaker. This means then that to run memmaker you have to comment 
it out of whichever startup file you have it in.

At the moment I only have one pc to try this on, so if anyone else 
would care to try and duplicate this, I'd be interested in knowing 
how it turned out.

Subject: McAffe v 104 bugs (PC)

I now regret my previous mailing on how great the new McAffe software is.
Here's what I posted to comp.sys.novell yesterday:

I've had worse bugs with NetShield v104 than have been reported yet.
I ran ok all day yesterday with the new version loaded on one server.
Late in the afternoon, I upgraded the 8 other servers on our network.
Within minutes, 3 servfDs had crashed with the console message:
 
Abend:  Free called with a memory block that has an invalid resource tag
        Running Process Netshield Threadv Process
 
Another one crashed with the same message, except it cited the Streams Q
Runner Process             
 
Since it worked OK on one server, I suspect that whatever automatically
checks for current vir.dat files on all servers is the culprit.  This is
a new "feature" that I would like to do without.  It's probably colliding
with Name Services.
 
Today we hit the max on Alloc Short Term Memory on one server that didn't
crash yesterday.  It seems that when you unload Netshield, it doesn't 
release the memory like a good NLM should.  
 
So, beware people with more than one server.  Obviously McAffe has skimped
on their testing equipment.

does this beast sound familiar, this guy is having problems that virus
checkers are not finding it... maybe he has some bad sectors or a
flakey disk... pls. reply by mail as I don't follow this group.

I am a mac user, and esp. with some of the newer machines, there are a number
of possibilities.  I don't program well, so couldn't write any of these if I 
wanted to, but imagine  a virus that patches calls to the power manager on
a powerbook- keeps the warnings from coming up, does not execute the power
dimming code, and lets the battery run completely dead while the machine is 
in use.  No gauranteed damage, but... wouldn't want it to happen to me. Ant
think of the possiblities for the duos and docs.  Way to complicated. Basically
any time you have software an hardware interfaciong, there is a hole open for 
some bad problems.

Subject: New Virus ? ABC10201 (PC)

To all,

	I seem to have a problem. I have found a directory that I have not
made. It's name is ABC10201. It is found on my c:\. At first I thought
it could have been a trash directory that I made one night, but here is
why I doubt it. I have tried to to run sca v2 and scanv102. sorry but cannot
remember exactly the names. But I scanv102 and It says no viruses detected.
Now here is the real kicker, If I use the old version of scan, it gets to
the above directory c:\abc10201. Now scan starts it search and the search 
path goes one directory deeper. example c:\abc1020\\ pm.Pag
Note that it has found this file  pm.Pag. also note that it has upper and lower
case and has a space like this inserted into it ^pm.Pag. Every time that I run
scan v2 it continues to go deeper into that darn abc10201 directory, until
the scan program stops. I have not count the directory sub layer but it's
a whole bunch. I have also noted that the abc10201 directory is attributed
as a system directory. 
Help ? It has not appeared to harm the system, but you guys never know ?
My system has dos 5.0 and 4 meg of memory, what would you suggest ?
Do you think a complete re-format would squash the sucker ?

Me not, too... but it's ridiculous to grant copyrights to code which is 
designed to propagate by itself :-)

Hi Frisk!

You wrote that emulating/singlestepping disinfectors are still in the 
experimental stage.
The program TBCLEAN from the TBAV package is such a heuristic cleaner which, 
in most cases, works great. You can, for example, disinfect the TREMOR virus 
with it, which is common in Germany. F-PROT 2.07 has been partially able to 
detect it, that cleaner killed it right from the start, without any 
information about the file when starting to emulate. I wouldn't call that 
experimental :-).

BTW: Do you plan to implement the removing of TREMOR into your next version of 
F-PROT?

Yes :-) what's so strange about that one? Doesn't it ever exist?
