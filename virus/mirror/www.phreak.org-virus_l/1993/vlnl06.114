  IPE Corporation Ltd (9-10 Alfred Place, London WC1E 7EB, England,
tel. (UK) 071 436 2244) have started to publish a periodical called
"Secure Times" about computer viruses and antivirals. The first
edition (numbered "vol 1, Sept 1993") arrived today as a free
distribution; it is of four A4 sides including an article about Tremor

It would be nice, but like you say later in your letter: it costs money.
Anyway remember that every key has at least 2 positions, and the
energy required to move it from one position to another is the same as the
energy required to move a mountain when it comes to users behaviour (isn't it
so ? ;-) ). Think of all the long-lost data that could be saved simply by
backups...
If you read Nemrod Kedem's idea in our last communications he has a great idea
of combining a Flash ROM with a somple ROM for security.

I disagree with you here: I think that PC manufacturers are with an open ear
to what is happening in the world and to user demands since the compatition is
so hard that any feature counts. Moreover it is my believe that we (the public)
influate the configuration of both hardware and software in the world. Is it
not a fact that MocroSoft swallowed an (BAD) Anti-Virus just to satisfy the
public? And a Disk-Doubler just for that same reason? And a ..... |-)

Did you here the say that the GARTNER group (making forecasts and predictions
of the market in future years) are so successful becaus the maket responds to
their predictions and tries to comply?

(The prophecy that fulfills itself).

It is enough that several of VirNet readers will ask the question when they
come to buy a new PC, that will cause the dealers to complain to the
manufacturer, and just a few dealers that complain draws a new picture to the
market's captains...

Subject: A thinker's thoughts...

I wrote this commentary (opinion/editorial) last year in hopes of
presenting it at the Ides of March Computer Security Conference
in New York, March 1993. Unfortunately, it was deemed a little
too controversial (or perhaps unimportant enough) to be accepted
for presentation. I am in the midst of writing an "updated" version
of the paper. Comments are always welcome.

With recent debate on the closure of Clancy's AIS systems, current
efforts to compile data on virus exchange systems world-wide and
impending legislation sponsored by Rep. Edward Markey (D-Mass.),
I find this commentary more apt than it was when I originally
wrote it.

                             ABSTRACT


        The introduction of the computer into our already complex
arsenal of tools has opened a door to a world in which the limits
are seemingly boundless.  The possibilities of electronic
information and data exchange alone are enough to boggle the mind.
However, with the computer's acceptance and its growing
implementation, a debate has arisen concerning the manner in which
it is being utilized.

        Today, we have a virtual stone wall separating two basic
trains of thought.  On one hand, there are those who wish to make
all computer information and resources publicly available, regardless
of impact or damage afforded to unwitting users.  On the other hand,
we have computer professionals, advocates and users who think
potentially damaging information should be more effectively managed
and controlled, disallowing damaging code to escape into the public
domain.

I have the Form virus on my pc.  I think I have infected several other

got rid of the virus.  I also cleaned my floppies with DOS 6's
anti-virual program.  I quit having things bogg down in my CPU for a
while then it started happening again.  Can someone tell me if Form
sleeps somewhere or can it exist on a LAN?

Boot from a protected diskette containing the same DOS-version as on your HD

      Actually, VIRSTOP - not FPROT.  I had a run-in with Michelangelo

   tests to see what we could do about it.  VIRSTOP does not (??) appear
   to do memory-testing for viruses already loaded?  We set up FPROT to
   load and scan the machine (using cmd line parms) and it can be set to
   scan memory -or- to auto-disinfect the disk.

      FPROT's auto-disinfect is nice, but that's only available if you
   do *not* scan the memory and it leaves the active virus in memory.
   The memory scan is nice, but it appears to detect a virus and continue
   through without locking the machine (if in cmd-line mode).

      Curiously enough, the configuration we toyed with that _did_ work
   as expected (locking on reboot if the diskette was infected) was a
   combination of VIRSTOP *and* VSHIELD.  It seems that VSHIELD's action
   to check the disk triggers VIRSTOP's /COPY (or one of the other parms)
   to detect a virus on the diskette - hanging the machine with a message
   to this effect.

      Anyone planning a package with the future detection abilities of the
   VIRSTOP /COPY and the bulldog attributes of VSHIELD's virus-in-memory
   detection?  I would definitely be interested.

Right.  (Well, it checks for a few old boot sector viruses, but that's it...)
I don't intend to let VIRSTOP do a full memory scan - if you need that
you should run F-PROT /NOFILE /NOBOOT and check the error return.  I did not
want to duplicate large parts of F-PROT in VIRSTOP, and I did not want to
check for a subset of viruses like VSHIELD does.

Well, what do you want ?   I do *NOT* consider it safe to disinfect with a
virus active in memory.  If you want the machine to freeze you should
use the /FREEZE option.   Otherwise the program will simply exit with an
errorcode, that you can check in a batch file.

There cannot be.

Different scanners use different scanning techniques.  For example, I
sometimes receive list of search patterns for "new" viruses, but those
hex-strings are of no use to me at all, as I need more information to add
detection of a new virus.

Some scanners allow you to add search patterns, but even they are not
compatible...for example some scanners allow variable-length wildcards, but
others do not.

It should!   As far as I know, F-PROT 2.09 can disinfect all variants of
Monkey.

But...

You have to boot from a clean diskette first - which (for some Monkey variants)
means that the C: partition will appear to have vanished.   If you tell F-PROT
to scan C:, it will refuse, saying that C: does not exist.

However, running F-PROT /DISINF /HARD (or selecting the equivalent options
from the menu) should work .... let me know if it doesn't.

It is easy to run anti-virus software on the server if you have a Novell
sever, and several Anti-Virus NLMs exist (from Cheyenne, McAfee, Sophos and
several other companies, including our own US distributor).

Nowever, if you are using another network, this may be impossible, but you

DIR-II does not work well under DOS-5.0 (and above) due to several reasons:
one of which you have detected (calling DOS as an absolute adress), the other
reason is that DIR-II replaced the block-device driver that is responsible of
accessing the disk tables (FAT, DIR...)...

True!

Just the same.
However in several cases I've seen DIR-II work even on DOS 5.0, but usually at
a later time the system  will hang and the disk crash.

Well, if that virus was really using the TPE, do you really think
that it would contain the string TRIDENT? I don't think so. What
I think it is, is just a virus created by the group TRIDENT. (maybe
one of their older creations)
Maybe I'll look into it to find out how many viruses the group
actually made and released.

SO DOES ANYONE KNOW WHETHER SUCH A SITE INDEED EXISTS ???

AND (to prevent any 'witty' straight 'YES' answers)
WHICH ONE ?

If you will read tthe August LAT, you will see that Scan missed several
viruses in my collection.

But Scan 106 is over a month old. I imagine 107 will do quite a bit better.

EICAR '93 Conference

    At a recent meeting the board of EICAR (European Institute for Computer
    Anti-Virus Research), decided to cancel the planned London conference
    this year.  I understand this is due to low participation in other
    computer security / anti-virus events this year.

    However, there will instead be a Members' Meeting in Hamburg (Germany),
    the proposed agenda is:
        25 November 1993
                14:00   Working Group 3 (Legal Questions) meeting
                16:00   Working Group 1 (Antivirus Technologies) meeting
                18:00   Joint Dinner

        26 November 1993
                09:00   Discussion of the Working Groups results
                11:00   Members Meeting
                13:00   Lunch

EICAR '94 Conference

    The next EICAR conference is proposed to be from 14 to 16 November 1994
    in the vicinity of London.

(Disclaimer; I am not an official spokesman for EICAR).
