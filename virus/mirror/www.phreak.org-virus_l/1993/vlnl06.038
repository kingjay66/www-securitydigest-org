VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  (The complete set of posting guidelines is available by
FTP on cert.org or upon request.) Please sign submissions with your
real name.  Send contributions to VIRUS-L@LEHIGH.EDU.  Information on
accessing anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is
distributed periodically on the list.  A FAQ (Frequently Asked
Questions) document and all of the back-issues are available by
anonymous FTP on cert.org (192.88.209.5).  Administrative mail
(comments, suggestions, and so forth) should be sent to me at:

Subject: Re: your opinions on virus legality

 Posession of a handgun is NOT illegal in Canada so long as you have an
FAC (Firearms aquisition certificate). Are you perhaps hinting that the
global computing community should be issuing VAPC's (Virus Aquisition
and Posession Certificates) ?

 This is getting quite interesting. I think I'll get in touch (whenever
I find time) with the local Mississauga, Ontario constabulary in charge
of computer crimes and pick his brain on this matter...

 I could see the point if a firearm is mistakenly discharged, the owner
is held personally liable, but a virus? As stated before in this
conference, some people just plainly DON'T KNOW that they are infected
and innocently and unbeknownst introduce it on another system whenever
new software is installed. Are they to be shot down and held liable for
"doing their job" or for being a "good samaritan". Sure copying of
software is illegal, but people do it all the time... Could this perhaps
be a detterant in order to get people to stop copying programs?

 The plot thickens...

 Cheers...

Subject: Why only PCs?

I have a question.  Why is it that all the virus discussions are about
PC's and Mac's?  There ARE other computers out there.  What about NeXt,
C-64, Amiga's.  I never see hardly anything on those types of computers.
Is it possible those types don't have as many virus problems as PC's?

Hello, faithful readers of Virus-L. I'm sure all of you join me in
congratulating our moderator, Ken van Wyk, on his new job down here in
Washington and in thanking him for continuing his efforts with
Virus-L.

I'd also like to thank Vesselin for mentioning our newest product,
V-Base:

You can also download the demo version of V-Base from the ICSA's BBS
(202-364-0644 - filename VBASEABC.ZIP). We're trying very hard to be
accurate and welcome any comments and certainly additional
information. If you do send us information, we'll investigate it and
cite you as a source. We're also including general information on
prevention, detection and removal, along with articles that are of
interest to both users and managers. V-Base is updated monthly and is
available both in single user licenses and site licenses. (end plug)

On another topic:

Next week marks this industry's annual Ides of March conference in
New York. As in the past, there will doubtless be some stimulating
talks and valuable catching-up with each other.

- -- The following statements are *not* meant as a flame against the
coordinators of the event - rather, it's an attempt to avoid potential
confusion.--

Some of you saw my picture in an ad for the conference in Computerworld
and are probably assuming that I'll be speaking. And some of you didn't
see the ad but are expecting me to speak because I've done so in the
past. However, I'd like to make clear that I was never invited to
speak, and I did not give permission for my picture to be used in
promotional material. A truly unfortunate turn of events, and I regret
that I won't be seeing all of you this year. I hope all who attend have
a good time.

That's USAns for you. But everyone else gets the last laugh... many of
their kids in secondary education cannot even point out where USA is on
a map. They also insist on calling USA America, thus insulting the
Canadians, Mexicans, et al.

Still, this does cut down on the number of dangerous viruses that the
USAns can write.

I read that article, and I don't like it at all.

11 viruses is not a large enough sample to test anti-viral software when
there are around 2,000 known specimens.

If they had tested these products against the viruses known to be in the
wild, the tests would have a lot more validity.

 The fact of the matter is, that any resident virus that monitors
function 4Bh, subfunction 00h (Int 21h) WILL be able to infect a file,
even if the extention has been renamed... (Provided the virus is written
"correctly"... Gack).

 Whenever a file is executed, it is immediately passed to AX,4B00h/INT
21h. The rest is at the mercy of the viral code... If the file can't be
executed, then it's never passed to AX,4B00h/INT 21h...

 (Someone correct me if I'm wrong...)

 Well, if it is a Sourcer-Generated disassembly, it's a damn good one. I
don't know German, but it compiles into a working copy and you are able
to make modifications to it and the pointers are flexible, unlike
Sourcer's static, rigid offsets...

 As far as I know, Sourcer does not let you EASILY change a disassembly
becuase of the EQUates and static values it generates. This disassembly
has a VSTART EQU $ and a VEND EQU $ that makes for flexible code length
finding and changes the relative offsets based on actual code length and
not "what sourcer wants to be in a certain location".

 I'll double check, as I've only looked it over on about 2 occasions,
but It sure looked like the real think...

version called Pro-Scan.  I agree that excluding shareware programs from
review was silly, but they did mention the shareware parallels of both
packages.  Of course, F-Prot Pro was (probably justifyably) as superior
to F-Prot, while Pro-Scan was portrayed as lacking in comparison to the
SCAN/CLEAN/VSHIELD trio.

To check for an executable file a virus will read in the appropriate bytes
and check to see if it is "MZ".

Why do some viruses check for "ZM"? What kind of file does this denote?

Here is a common problem that I have detected with f-prots virstop...
When a program loads and virstop finds a virus it doesn't remove that program
from memory and thus leads to further infection unless rebooted..

Any suggestion as to how to effictively remove the bug from memory???

Simple.  There are none.

There are several good *Freeware* programs, at least for the Mac, as well as
several good *Shareware* scanners/cleaners available, but no public domain
ones - at least that I know of.

You cannot.  CARO maintains several mailing lists, for various purposes - one
of which is supposed to be an "open channel" for "outsiders", but it is not
for virus samples...just questions.

yep...thanks... :-)

The best way is actually just to do that...send us, or other CARO members
like Vesselin Bontchev the viruses, either on a diskette or by E-mail
(encrypted, please, and send the password via fax or by phone).  If you have
FTP access, you can also upload the samples to /incoming (which is write-only)
on my personal machine (complex.is).  Once I (or one of the other CARO members)
get the viruses, they will be distributed to the rest of the group.

My only experience of CHKDSK so far is running CHKDSK /f today. On my PC just
now it found and recovered over SIXTEEN MILLION bytes of hard disk storage in
40 lost chains. Many of them were work files left by (interrupted?) runs of an
old Fortran compiler called WATFOR, which I had to use to prepare programs for
running on some old PC's with 286 processors in that my department has.
