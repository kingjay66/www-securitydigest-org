I'll take the risk to disagree with my boss... :-) While I am
perfectly aware of the general public oppinion that "good viruses" are
a "bad idea", I also find some of Dr. Cohen's examples pretty
convincing. I am not yet prepared to argue on the subject. I am not
even decided myself whether "good viruses" can exist or not. However,
I am quite certain that responsible research in this field should not
be forbidden.

Anyway, about a year ago, I have posted here a message, asking for
arguments supporting the oppinion that a good virus is a bad idea. I
have collected about a dozen - all of them very good ones, but they
still have not convinced me. Nevertheless, as I said, I am not
prepared to argue on this subject yet, so please don't send me
messages proving that you are right and I am wrong. (Just for the
record, I would like to note that I am not convinced that Dr. Cohen is
right, either.)

However, in an attempt to help Mr. Frigerio in his legal fights, I am
posting here the arguments that I have collected. I hope that they
will be helpful to him - virus exchange is something that I am
strongly opposed to, and I would welcome any reasonable legislation
against it.

Not quite. Compressing the program with something like PKLite does the
same (modification), yet nobody says that PKLite is illegal. I agree
that unauthorized reproduction is a bad thing, but who ever claimed
that the good viruses have to reproduce without authorization?

Anyway, as I said, I am not prepared to argue on this subject yet.

           A dozen reasons why a "good" virus is a bad idea

1) It is unethical to modify somebody's data without his/her
knowledge. In several countries this is also illegal.

2) Modifying a program could mean that the owner of the program loses
his/her rights for technical support, ownership, or copyright.

3) Once released, you have no control on how the virus will spread; it
may reach a system about which you know nothing (or which could have
even not existed at the time the virus is created) and on which it
might cause non-intentional damage. Even if the bug is discovered, it
would be extremely difficult to find all replicants of the virus and
apply the appropriate fix to them.

4) A bad guy could get a copy of the virus and modify it to include
something malicious. Actually, a bad guy could trojanize -any-
program, but a "good" virus will provide the attacker with means to
transport his malicious code to a virtually unlimited population of
computer users.

5) The anti-virus programs will have to distinguish between "good" and
"bad" viruses, which is essentially impossible.  Also, the existence
of useful programs which modify other programs at will, will make the
integrity checkers essentially useless, because they will be able only
to detect the modification and not to determine that it has been
caused by a "good" virus.

6) A virus will eat up disk space and time resources unnecessarily
while it spreads.

7) A virus could contain bugs which might damage something or harm
somebody.  Any program could be buggy, but the virus is a
self-spreading buggy program which is out of control.

8) A virus will disable the few programs on the market which check
themselves for modifications and halt themselves if they have been
changed, thus performing a denial-of-service attack.

9) Anything useful that could be done by a virus, could also be done
with a normal, non-replicating program.

10) A virus steals control of the machine from the user and ruins the
trust that the user has in his/her machine - the belief that s/he can
control it.

11) Declaring some viruses as "good" will just give an excuse to the
crowd of virus writers to claim that they are actually doing
"research".

12) For most people the word "computer virus" is already loaded with
negative meaning. They will not accept a program called like that,
even if to claims to do something useful.

There is indeed something special in/about Swiss German, but this ain't
it  ;-)  In fact, it's just plain horrible officialese/legalese "High"
German. To answer your question, I think (b) is what they're talking about, mor
e
or less. (I haven't read the original post, though). Which means, of
course that, yes, the burning of floppies is also covered, along with
viri, plug-pulling, sledgehammers, etc. They're thorough back in the old
country :-)

(I know this is not a linguistics group, but I didn't start this! You
are correct in thinking that translation (a) is also 'possible', ie,
grammatically correct -- it just wouldn't be likely in this kind of
text, or in any technical writing. To put it simply, the adverbial
phrase would be positioned so that it is no longer ambiguous. I'm sure
there's a better way of explaining this, but not at 0018 here in the
Land of Oz!)

It extends the area covered to include not only data that is stored but
also data that is in transit. I think it is a useful addition.

As usual, there are no "best" solutions. In general, it is a good idea
to restrict access to the shared files on the network as much as
possible. Mark them in such a way that the users can only execute
them. (How exactly this is achievable and to what extent, depends on
the kind of network you have.) Tell those users with supervisor
privileges to never log in as privileged users, if they suspect that
the system is infected. Also, tell them to never execute other
people's files, while they are logged in as privileged users. In
general, create alternative accounts for them with "normal"
privileges, and tell them to use only those accounts, except in those
cases, when a task has to be performed that requires more privileges.
Restrict access  the best you can without hampering productivity. Make
sure that the server's console is physically secure.

If you are asking about anti-virus products, many producers will be
happy to sell you a LAN version of their scanner, which includes both
an NLM for the server and a resident scanner for each of the
workstations. There are also integrity checkers which support Novell
LANs - for instance, Untouchable.

Everytime we load a 3rd party package (ie.  Interleaf doesn't send us
source, only binary) or the OS, and as the Moderator indicated, to
every NFS system, which reaches about 500 nodes for us.  Also, while
we try to stress to our user community, that they need to go through
us, some of them still pull binaries and programs off of other
machines and their "friends".  You might ask how would they get them
to run, and I would reply, there are lots of Suns out there to get
binaries from.

hourly.  Our users have a interesting configuration.  They have local
floppy drives (OH WOW!).  They tend to copy their own files off the
system so that they feel more secure in their information.  It also
indicates that they can also load information onto the machine.  And
if you haven't heard, Sun is now making it possible to do this without
root priviledges.

While a sysop will take protective measures that he/she knows,
remember that many products ask to be installed as root.  If there is
a virus in that package, then it was just installed as root and can
run amuck throughout the entire "trusted" network, not just the local
machine.  If you think that this is far fetched then you probably
don't remember some of the "shrink wrapped" software that has been
shipped with Viruses, accidently, in them for PC's and MACs.

Are you out of touch with the Unix world?  Many of us have Unix boxes
at home, we have a couple of sparcbooks that run around the country
picking up whatever may land on them and we have people that come in
after hours to play games and just work on their own stuff.  Not only
is Unix now available to more people, but the people also have more
time to work on Unix cracking if they are so inclined.

I am sorry that the tone of this is sarcastic, but I have been
fighting with people for several years now, not to ignore viruses on
Unix machines.  There may not be many floating around yet, but
ignorance of the problem is no solution.  It will just jump up and
bite us if we are not ready.  Unix machines and PC's are starting to
look much like each other.  If there is a problem with viruses on
PC's, why do people think that there will not be a problem, some day
on Unix machines.

No, Kevin's reply was more correct - the term "parasitic" is usually
used to label a virus which attaches itself to files somehow
physically (not necessarily at the end) - that is, one that does not
overwrite them, and not a companion or boot sector virus.

The key here is "scanners". Integrity management software will spot it
immediately (my FreeWare CHKMEM will spot it instantly in memory using
a check added in 1990 - doesn't even require memory size input).

Ya know, I`ve always been hazy on this point, at least. Why does should a
scanner /have/ to open a file? Could an effective string serach be done at the
DISK level, such as what such utils as NDD do? Sector by sector, it would be;
and it would require that the whole disk be done, as opposed to just one file.

Sure, the program would have to keep track of what file such and such a sector
is assigned to, but it should be able to do this by using the FAT as a data
file, thereby avoiding the opening of ANY files, except the scanning EXE
itself.

Or am I sideways, here?

Thanks for all the info, and thanks to the folks who sent me reams of

Indeed, that's a known bug in F-Prot. Also, it will misidentify the
virus (as "new variant of Stoned") on anything other than a 360 Kb
floppy.

Hm. That's a neat idea. Yes, it is possible to poll the ports of the
floppy disk controller and to check the write protection status. I
don't know whether this will require the drive motor to be turned on.
Try to implement it and keep us posted.

Nope. The virus is polymorphic. I have not analysed it, but it is
quite possible that no single scan string for it (or even a
reasonably small set of them) can be found.

Try VET from Cybec. It's an anti-virus company local to you, and since
the virus has also been reported first in Australia, it is quite
likely that their software can deal with it.

I hope that this example can show you why gathering virus "signatures"
("scan strings" is the more appropriate term) is not a good idea -
there are viruses for which no such scan strings can exist.

First, there is no such thing as the MtE virus. MtE is a polymorphic
engine - a library function that can be linked to a virus written to
use it, which makes it polymorphic. This way, the author of the virus
doesn't have to care to implement polymorphism himself, and the
polymorphism provided by MtE is very good. Currently there are a
couple of dozens of viruses, which use the MtE. Some (most) scanners
are unable to distinguish between them and call all of them just "MtE"
(or "DAME", or whatever).

In my tests, the latest versions of McAfee's SCAN were able to detect
the MtE-based viruses reliably. CPAV also has reasonably good
detection, although it is not 100% reliable. I don't know what PC
Virus is, but if you mean PC Vaccine Professional, it is also able to
detect the MtE reliably. As opposed to that, NAV up to and including
version 2.1 is known to have unreliable detection of the MtE-based
viruses. The older versions of the virus definitions were also known
to cause false positives.

Therefore, I am inclined to believe that in your case you don't have a
virus, but are a victim of a false positive.

Subject: *HELP*--Possible Virus? (PC)

Hi.  I've read the FAQ, and i didn't find anything describing my problem.
I think that i may have a virus of sorts.

I'm using a 496DX2 IBM compatiblerunning MS-DOS 6 with a TVGA89-blah card.
Occasionally, when i power up,nothing happens on the screen.  The power light
is on, the fan is going, butthere are no Power On Self Tests (memory, drive
check, ect...).  This is remedied by hard-booting.  I was told that this was
most likely caused by a bad BIOS chip, but, i can hear my hard disk work for
approx. 2-3 seconds when i power up.  It is only when this happens that the
screen blanks.

I've run the three virus checkers that i own, CP Antvir, Manitoba Hydro scan,
and Msav.  Cp hangs, Manitoba Hydro doesn't find my boot record, and Msav
detects nothing.  Any help would be appreciated.

Many thanks in advance,

Chris.

A combination of things. Miserable detection rate, sometimes crashes,
very weak integrity checker, the resident part in most versions can be
disabled or even removed from memory by a virus, some misleading and
plain wrong things in the manual, etc., etc. The restricted variant
called MSAV that comes with MS-DOS 6.0 is even worse. Yisrael Radai
has an article, explaining all the deficiencies in MSAV; it is
available in PostScript format from our anonymous ftp site:

Which editor is the best? Which compiler is the best? None! It all
depends on what exactly you need. Of course, some products perform
some anti-virus functions better than others.

> things?

I'm sure by now you've already received some replies to your question,
but anyway, here are 15 reasons why I think CPAV is an inferior
product:

1.  CPAV consistently scores at or near the bottom on comparisons of
 known-virus scanners with respect to their detection rate.
2.  CPAV's scanning is relatively slow.
3.  CPAV's resident program VSafe (or Vwatch) can be very easily
 disabled by a virus (even when the program is installed as a device
 driver).
4.  VSafe does not detect creation of new executables (important for
 detecting companion viruses), modifications to files with a non-
 executable extension or renaming of files (thus enabling a virus to
 circumvent the fact that modifications to files with an executable
 extension are detected).
5.  The integrity checking does not detect companion viruses.
6.  If the checksum database is deleted by a virus, instead of
 sounding an alarm, CPAV simply creates the database anew, using the
 *infected* files as a basis for future comparison instead of the
 original ones.
7.  CPAV checksums only the first 63 bytes of a file.  A virus could
 be written which infects files without altering either these 63 bytes
 or the file size.  Furthermore, a virus could overwrite the scan
 strings within CPAV.EXE or VSAFE.COM with garbage, without the user
 becoming aware of this.
8.  CPAV's checksum algorithm is not key-dependent.  Hence for any
 given file, all users will have the same checksum.  This could easily
 be exploited to forge checksums.
9.  CPAV 2.0 can detect viruses within certain types of compressed
 executables and archives, but it is very slow at this.
10. CPAV 2.0 contains heuristic scanning, but its detection rate is
 very low.
11. Some of the defaults (Anti-Stealth = Off and Check All Files = On)
 are very poorly chosen.
12. Despite claims to the contrary, it seems that scan patterns
 containing wildcards are still not encrypted, causing "ghost
 positives" when other scanners scan memory after CPAV or VSafe has
 been active, and possibly false positives in the CPAV.EXE and
 VSAFE.COM files themselves.  No other widely used scanner (except
 MSAV, which is a sub-product of CPAV) fails to take some measure to
 prevent such false alarms.
13. CPAV hangs after scanning a certain number of MtE-infected
 programs.
14. Keeping a separate checksum database for each directory uses a lot
 of disk space and makes blocking of some of the above security holes
 very difficult.
15. Market-wise, CPAV has been rather successful.  However, high sales
 figures do not imply high quality, especially in the AV field, where
 the ordinary user has no way of knowing how good a product really is.
 The developers of CPAV have consistently demonstrated that sales fi-
 gures are much more important for them than quality of their product.

  Note: It is possible that a few (relatively minor) faults among those
mentioned above have been corrected since the last version of CPAV
which I examined.  However, I'm quite sure that this does not apply to
any of the major faults.

Can't be. Joshi infects only boot sectors; it can't infect across the
network. Just make sure you don't boot your server from an infected
floppy.

> this happen. Does anyone know how toremove YOSHI?

Best solution is to use the appropriate anti-virus program that knows
the virus and can remove it. Try F-Prot, or CLEAN, for instance.

Otherwise, a poor man's removal tool for MBR infectors is to boot from
MS-DOS 5.0 or above (the version is important), make sure you still
"see" the files on your hard disk (unless you don't care whether they
will be preserved), and run the command "FDISK /MBR". This will cure
the virus from the hard disk, but it will remain on the infected
floppies, and forgetting such a floppy in drive while the computer is
booting, will cause a reinfection. Therefore, I'll still need an
anti-virus program to disinfect all the infected floppies.

Qrry is a MBR infector, so just doing FDISK /MBR will be sufficient to
remove it from the hard disks. It doesn't matter what version of DOS
you have on them; you just need version 5.0 or above, or FDISK will
not support the /MBR switch.

SYS -is- DOS version dependent, but you need it only to remove the
virus from floppies, and it doesn't really matter what version of the
boot sector you'll put on them.

Just copy the files from them somewhere else (file-by-file, using COPY
or XCOPY, -not- DISKCOPY), format the diskette and copy the files
back. Or just SYS them, if there is enough space for a copy of DOS.

Yes. When DOS is executing the DIR command, it has to read the boot
sector of the diskette, in order to figure out some parameters. "To
read" the boot sector means that a copy of it is read in the DOS
buffers, i.e. in memory. If this copy is infected, this means that a
copy of the virus is read in memory. However, it never receives
control and cannot infect. But it is there and that's why some
scanners find it there after a DIR of an infected diskette. I maintain
the oppinion that this is a mistake and they shouldn't be looking for
the virus at a place in memory where it definitely can't be.

No need to reboot. If the scanner continues to moan that the virus is
active (when you know that it isn't), tell it not to scan the memory -
most scanners have such an option.

No, unless you attempt to boot the server from an infected floppy.
Then you will infect the server's hard disk, but it will be still
unable to propagate the virus to the workstations across the network.

It sure does have one, just there is no way to access it across the
network, because NetWare does not support sector access across the
network.

I just scanned my whole virus collection for this scan string and no

Indeed... :-) I will add that even the above information is already

I beg to disagree - detection that something is in memory is easy,
identification that it is exactly this virus - isn't as easy as that,
