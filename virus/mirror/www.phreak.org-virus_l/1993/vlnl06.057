Subject: Ides of March Virus Conference

I've read Buford Buckeye's entertaining April Fool's spoof of the
Ides of March conference, which appeared on Virus-L.  

Buford does have some valid points concerning what isn't the only
conference specializing in malware but is certainly the oldest,
best known, least costly to attend, largest - and most complex.

For 1993 we spent a considerable amount of money on an outside
management group to get what Buford calls "confusion" under control.
To euphemize, the result did not live up to aspirations.

As some know, the way the conference is run is being reorganized
from the ground up.  This process is not yet finished.  When it
is, the overall plan for March 1994 in New York will be made
available to interested parties.  

In the meanwhile, nobody is going to claim "next year better"
from here on because not all the major changes are yet complete.   
Even when they are, it will probably be more meaningful for you
to draw your own conclusions based on what is put forth, rather 
than take my or anybody else's word on it.

Those desiring to be kept posted on progress toward bettering 
the 1994 "7th," should e-mail a postal address to  jsb@well.sf.ca.us.

Thanks for taking the time to read this.

Subject: Interested in research by Dr. Cohen

Hello,

I am a university student doing research on computer viruses.  I have
already gotten information on DOS viruses, so much that it is up to my
ears.  I am now interested in viruses on different platforms
especially MVS, VMS, and UNIX.  I know that Dr. Cohen did some
interesting work at the University of Southern California, where he
proved that a UNIX viruses could give people root premission within a
1/2 half hour.  I am very interested in the work Dr. Cohen has done on
viruses.  I would be interested in talking to him, any body that
happens to read this and can help me please e-mail me the informatino
at s9106568@sandcastle.cosc.brocku.ca.

If you do read this Dr. Cohen please contact me.  The idea of viruses
and system security interest me greatly.  Thank you in advance.

Well, since I came here more to learn than to teach (which I doubt I'll ever 
do), I would sincerely appreciate it if you could more elaborate.

I've been out of the virus world for too long, working on other projects my 
boss assigned, leaving the virus fighting untouched.

Where to I acquire the FAQ sheet?

I see your point.

However, the way I see it, when we're discussing protection of BIG companies,
as opposed to the protection of private people, the chances of someone 
downloading a virus from a board in order to deliberately upload it, are much 
smaller, if existant at all. If a company is wise enough to enfore a 
prohibition of disk exchange, and capable of doing it, then the networks/modem 
connection are the only way to get infected, and assuming those links are 
reliable links with reliable sources, this reduces the chance even further.

I see your point.

Well, I don't think I have the slightest idea about what 5 years from now will 
look for, in whatever concerns virus techniqes, virus availability and degree 
of common, and so on. This is is a fast business...

CA|  Their system was an old 8086 with a 30mb HD running DOS v3.1 (Yeah!
CA| OLD!). Stoned was nestled in the partition table... CLEAN did a great
CA| job getting rid of Stoned in the partition table, but it also did a
CA| great job of getting rid of the partition table...

It sounds like you had a stoned variant.
 
I believe Stoned stores the original data on track 0, Side 0, sector 7.
 
Clean expects the original data to be stored in the location above. If the 
data isn't in the correct location, a corrupted partition table results.

IMHO is an acronym that stands for "In My Humble opinion".

.bill.lambdin@frenchc.eskimo.com

TL| I have received some excellent replies to my posting on catching
TL| a virus.  Basically the question is this:  Assume my system is
TL| clean and I have an infected disk.  I put the disk in the drive
TL| and do a DIR.  Then I take the disk out.  Can my system be
TL| infected now?

I have also heard people claim that accessing a diskette with a boot 
sector virus will infect the hard drive.
 
I performed the following test with three boot sector viruses.
 
Chinese Fish
No-Int
Stoned B

Listed  directory of infected diskette.
 
Listed directory on the hard drive.
 
Scanned the hard drive. Scan reported the virus in memory

re-booted the computer

Scanned the hard drive, and Scan reported that the hard drive was clean.
 
So I can say with some assurance.
 
The Boot sector of the floppy is read into memory, but not activated.
 
None of the three viruses spread to the hard drive.
 
Hope this helped.

Subject: Unknown little virus? (PC)

Hi,

Last time I had virus in my PC. It came from Internet probably with one
from shareware games. The problem is that teh virus was not detected by any
program. I tried to find it by Scan 100, F-Prot 2.07 and Polish AV program
MkSVir (available at FUNET with on-line translator). This virus caused
General Protection Fault in Windows 3.1 in krnl386.exe when running Write,
Paintbrush, MS Word 2.0 and System Editor. It was probably very small. I
think it took 32 bytes of base memory (difference between memory with and
without virus). I throw it out by formatting HD and setting up system
again. My question is: has anyone heard/seen anything about this virus? Is
there any signature? Which programs in Internet might be infected?

Thanks for attention,
Maciej Otreba

Hello John,

Yes, I know.. there is a Hypertext Database available, with the name
VSUMX3nn.ZIP (where nn is number of month).. Try downloading VSUMX303.ZIP
or get it via FTP. You can find it via ftp from mcafee.com (I think).
and by modem you can find it at VFR Systems (219) 273-2431.

That listing contains info about all know viruses, activation dates,
origin countries etc.. it's quite good.

My father in law just called me at my office,
complaining about Windows menu-fonts getting gobbled up after
some 30 minutes of playing PGA Tour (Golf ?) ... .
Other application-fonts are also impossible to read.
 
He looked around in directorys and found files
(in all of them) that kept showing up after deletion.
Their names are like:
apbaaial, apbaaibb, apbocndm, apbocnec .... 
All of them 0 bytes.

someone can help me.
Meantime I will try out "VirusCheck 3.0".

At risk of stretching this out more, just one more chime on the WP "virus".

This text-file growth thing is absolutely "normal" (though annoying as all

This would be due to Netware preventing WP's temp file from being deleted,
probably.  I've had the same problem with a security program we use here.

Actually, that file growth -- perfectly "normal", as you say -- can
sometimes be in the range of 20-60K at a pop, for a one-page file.  It's not
a bug so much as a design flaw -- i.e., it's obviously _meant_ to work that
way, but they didn't think through the logical consequences of that design
in practice. 

>It only seems to happen to certain files under certain situations.  

It is most obvious when using Styles and large discreet printer driver
files.  But it also happens whenver you use the COPY or MOVE commands,
though not as obviously.

Frans Velman is workin on a new version of TBSCAN that has a new kind
of signature file, this file is procompiled, so there is a smaller
chance of tampering, the signature file is also entypoint aware and
includes the *.avr files (so you only will need three files in your
dir.)  The New signature file will be updated at least every month and
will be called tbsigxyy.zip x stands for the Least Significant digit
of the year and yy stand for the followup number. the first signature
file will thus be called TBSIG301.ZIP.

there are more things about the new version, I can send a Beta versoion to 
Everybody who wants it, If there is enoug reply, i can send it to
garbo.

Hope you know enoug now.

Subject: Can a virus damage McAfee? (PC)

I believe I may have contracted a boot sector virus on my PC.  Upon
rebooting from a clean disk and using the latest McAfee virus scanner, I
received the message that my copy of the virus scanner had been damaged. 
This is a recent development since I had used the scanner last week with
no problems.  I also received this message when I tried to scan from (what
I assume was) a copy protected disk.  Any help would be appreciated.

anyone come across this one?  The gerbil.doc virus?

takes a text file, turns it into rubbish and at the top it says
gerbil.doc.

weird, eh?

DIR is an internal command and is executed by the currently loaded
command interpreter. It DOES NOT require reloading of the command
interpreter. Thus, even if the command interpreter on the floppy is
infected, it WILL NOT be loaded (and executed) if you do a DIR on that
floppy. Therefore, you CANNOT get infected this way.

Regarding the original question - can you get infected if you do a DIR
on a (possible infected) floppy. In order to get infected, you must
execute some viral code. Therefore, the question is equivalent to
whether you can execute some code by executing the DIR command on a
floppy.

The only way I could figure you can make the DIR command execute
something, is to have some sort of ANSI escape sequence in the file
names that appear in the directory listing. The volume label offers
the most space for that (11 characters), but even it is not sufficient
for a good and unnoticeable ANSI bomb. The most I could achieve was to
make DIR cause the re-programming of a single key to produce a single
character when pressed. This seems insufficient for ANSI bombs to
me...

Anyway, it is very easy to close this security hole. The options are:

1) Don't load ANSI.SYS.

2) Use a different, less brain-damaged ANSI driver, which allows you to
disable keyboard reprogramming (e.g., NANSI).

3) Patch ANSI.SYS to change the keyboard reprogramming character to
something else.

4) Use the TSR program PKSFANSI to disable the keyboard reprogramming.

Vesselin

More exactly, it is called a "ghost false positive".

Hello.

just received from Padgett Peterson the newest version of his FIXUTIL suite of
programs.  The file is now available for FTP processing from us as
FIXUTIL5.ZIP.

Thanks Padgett!

- ----  FIXUTIL5.NEW file ---

FixUtilities copyright (C) 1989-1993 by Padgett - all rights reserved.

FixUtil5 is the April 1993 revision of the FixUtils.

		WHAT'S NEW

The major change is that the FixUtils are now all FREEWARE. 

For the Lawyers: A limited license is hereby granted such that anyone may
use these copyrighted programs (see list below) without any charge of any 
kind so long as they are not altered nor are any deposited programs or
code fragments altered in any way. Specifically, copyright notices and
logos must display anytime a program or deposited code fragment executes.

Distribution must include this notice.

Weasel-Words: There are no warranties either granted or implied for fitness 
of any kind, use of these programs is entirely at the risk of the user.

		Major Changes

FixMBR now generates automatically a copy of the original MBR with
a user designated name of up to 7 characters. This .DAT file should be
stored in a safe place off-line. When changed to a .COM file and executed,
the original MBR will be restored.

On machines having BIOS selection of the boot disk, users may now select
booting only from the C: drive for additional protection from viruses.
If the CTRL key is held down during the boot, SafeMBR, following integrity
checking of the hard disk MBR will transfer the boot process to drive A:
to allow booting from floppy for maintenance purposes.

		Other

a) For those wishing a special corporate logo to display (e.g. "XYZ Corp.
   For Authorized Use Only") or suppression of the floppy boot option,
   this can be provided for a one-time-fee.

b) Gifts cheerfully accepted. (POBox 1203, Windermere, FL, USA, 34786)

Subject: New file on risc / site listing (PC)

The file vsig9303.zip has been placed on risc.ua.edu for anonymous ftp in
the directory /pub/ibm-antivirus.  (risc.ua.edu = 130.160.4.7)

Below is a listing of files available on risc via anonymous FTP.  I have been
away on spring break the past week and feel sure that there are probably some
updates I have missed.  If you notice an outdated file, please let me know.
If you know where I can ftp an update from, I would appreciate you dropping
me a line.
