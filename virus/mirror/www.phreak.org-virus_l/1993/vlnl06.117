Good concept but has two major problems (either or):
1) Using a "self latching relay" to maintain configuration after you
   release the "ignition switch" - really expen$ive.
2) Using software to maitain the write enable - possible to bypass unless
   built into the ROM. (switch still expensive - priced one for a car lately
   - and still may be possible for software to bypass: on a 386 just swap ROM
   to RAM (shadow) & "fix"...)

What I was thinking of was much like (2) but why use an expensive switch ?
Just have a position that enables a specific "write_enable" *hardware* line
that also prevents a real boot - executed ROM does just this but is powerless
to run without hardware setting.

If the PC will not boot in the "update" position, no one can accidently
leave it there & run a virus.

Hardware is the only real protection but software alone is probably "good
enough". Software is always cheaper than hardware. (Just look at the market).

My wife is looking for information on virus propagation on Novell networks. I
asked about this a few months ago on the novell newsgroup and got about a
dozen replies but I didn't keep them. Sigh.

My recollection was that the Novell software could not be infected but that if
an administrator allowed users to store and shared executeable files on
the server that a virus could be propagated this way. (Thus allowing
individuals to upload and share executables was not wise.) The consensus was
that barring this it was difficult for a virus to propagate across a network.

Is my recollection correct? Does anyone have anything to add to this.

Short answers: many DOS file-infectors can run and spread in
OS/2 VDMs (Virtual DOS Machines; DOS Sessions).  I don't have an
estimate of the percentage, though.  The filesystem doesn't
matter (but see below).  There are no known OS/2-specific viruses.

Long answer (perhaps a candidate for the FAQ if it isn't
already there):

Many (how many? hard to say) DOS file-infectors are "well-behaved",
and will run and spread just fine in OS/2 DOS VDM's.  Others are
very DOS-version dependent, and may not run correctly there.  No
known DOS file-infector can run under OS/2 itself; they all use
either DOS or BIOS interrupt calls to do their thing, and neither
of those work correctly in OS/2 sessions.  OS/2 executables actually
contain two programs; one that runs if the program is invoked under
DOS, and one that runs if the program is invoked under OS/2.  Some
DOS file-infectors may be able to correctly infect the DOS "fork"
of an OS/2 executable (EXE file), if the EXE file is available when
an infected program is run in a DOS session; if the OS/2 program is then
accidentally run under DOS, the virus might run, load into memory,
spread, and so on (only under DOS or an OS/2 DOS session, though,
not under OS/2 itself).  If a virus tries to do damage in an OS/2
DOS session by doing things that a DOS session isn't allowed to do
(certain direct disk writes, for instance), the damage will not
happen.  On the other hand, if a DOS virus tries to do damage
that a DOS session *is* allowed to do (erasing or altering files,
for instance), the damage will occur.

Since programs running in DOS VDMs can only see files that have
names fitting in the 8.3 namespace, files with longer (HPFS)
names, or on longer paths, aren't visible from there, and can't
be infected by a DOS program.  This doesn't mean that HPFS
disks are completely invisible, of course!  If you have a
FOO.COM on an HPFS disk, it's visible to DOS VDM's, and
therefore infectable by a well-behaved DOS virus run from
a VDM.  But if you have a directory called long.dir.name,
nothing in the tree under it will be visible from DOS
(of course,  you can accidentally copy an infected file
into the tree yourself, while in OS/2).

Boot viruses are another matter, since they run *before* the
operating system loads, and don't use operating system calls.
If you boot an OS/2 system (or any other system that has a
compatible CPU and real-mode BIOS and disk architecture) from
an infected diskette, the virus will probably be able to run,
write itself to the hard disk, and load into memory just as
it would on a DOS system.  When the system is later booted
from the infected hard disk, the virus will again be able to
run and load into memory before OS/2 gets control.  Because of
the way OS/2 controls diskettes, though, no known boot virus
can spread *from* an OS/2 machine (OS/2 doesn't ever use the
interrupt calls that the virus depends on to spread to
diskettes).  So an OS/2 system can become infected, and can
be damaged by a virus, but can't generally spread the
infection further.  (And of course some viruses have
built-in assumptions that are only true on DOS systems,
and so malfunction when infecting an OS/2 system, sometimes
killing the virus, the system, or both.)

Well, we had in July a virus which SCAN called 'TridenT' but CLEAN wasn't
able to remove it. No other scanner was able to locate this virus. And
indeed is it not related to Trident/TPE. I sent the results of my
investigations to CARO and frisk. So I think the next F-PROT release
should be able to find and remove it (frisk?)...

Here is a short review:
only infects EXE-files
length: 756-771 byte
simple XOR-based encryption with variable key
indirect action (or you may say memory resident :-) )
memory allocation: via MCB-Manipulation at top of RAM
infection trigger: program execution (DOS-Fn. 4B00 and 4B02) and a few other
  conditions
damage trigger: Oct. 11. (and some other conditions)
damage: mirrors screen horizontally and vertically
quick & (very) dirty scan string (the short decryption routine):
  BE 10 01 B9 E4 02 2E 80 34 ?? 46 E2 F9
there is a short ascii string inside the encrypted body: 'GNAT 1.0' - the
  name for it I think

The new Computer-Virus-Catalog (VTC Hamburg) includes a more detailed
report about this.

If you have any infected files left somewhere you could check this signature
or send me an sample (please use PGP-encryption) to verify this.

Hope this helps,
                 Dirk

I agree 100% Padgett:

the scanner authors should add the ability to detect droppers. Even though
they themselves aren't viruses, they should be detected. Some have replied
to me with " Why? the scanner will detect the virus after it is laid on the
boot sector." The idea is to detect the dropper before infection takes
place. It is always best to prevent a user from running a dropper than to
have the user remove the virus later.

Subject: MONKEY variant? (PC)

We have just been through a battle with the MONKEY virus, at least
as identified by SCAN 106. It may be a new variant, because of the
various messages we've received by the various A-V products.

We booted with a clean write-protected floppy and ran F-PROT 2.09 Professional,
which reported "Boot infection: New variant of Stoned
                No attempt made to disinfect the the new variant."

SCAN 9.17 v106 "Found the Monkey [Mon] Virus in boot sector." We haven't
tried CLEAN to get rid of it because during the sequence of events, we reduced
our copy to the original infecting floppy and want to keep it.

KILLMONK reported:
    *** Probably infected. A previously unidentified variant of
    *** the monkey virus is almost certainly on your hard disk.
    *** Get help: contact martin@cs.ualberta.ca

To get rid of the virus, we ran FDISK /MBR followed by a SYS C: from
a clean bootable floppy. Copies of the BOOT record are beaming to Frisk
as we speak. We believe the virus was brought back from Europe last week
by one of our users.

Subject: Re: SPORT21C.ZIP (PC)

A file called SPORT21C.ZIP was available for download for a
short time from the CIX online service in Britain at the end
of July.  It was found to contain a variant of Goddam
Butterflies virus (itself a variant of Civil War) with a
change to the virus text message.  The new message reads,
"Hooray The Crusades".

Both the uploader and the CIX system administrator checked
the file for viruses, but unfortunately both used the same
virus detector which did not detect this variant, so the
alarm was not sounded until a downloader ran a different
virus detector which did find the virus.

The file was quickly removed and all those known to have
downloaded it were contacted.  The CIX outbreak is believed
to have been contained at that point, but the virus
obviously had to have come from somewhere.  Goddam
Butterflies is said to have been accidentally released on
the Internet recently.

This virus is not a fast infector, and spreads slowly. It
adds 302 bytes to COM files.  There is no payload. The virus
does not go memory resident.  It avoids infecting
COMMAND.COM.

INSTALL.COM is infected with a new variant of Butterfly.

This virus is 302 bytes in length like the original Butterfly, but this one
has two major differences.

1. This variant contains the text string "Hurray the Crusades!"
2. This variant will infect .EXE files as well as .COM files.

F-Prot 2.09 detects this virus as Butterfly in .COM files, but misses it in
EXE files. Add this signature to F-Prot or others scanners that allow the
use of external signature file.

Name: Butterfly (Crusades)
Infects: .COM and .EXE files.
Signature: B4 4E 8D B6 50 02 8D 96 2C 02 52 EB 3C B4 1A BA

Remove the spaces between the HEX values when adding the signature.

The second generation of this virus is also infectious.

Skulason, Wolfgang Stiller, David Chess, and Glenn Jordan.

As is well known by now there are no defects in MicroSoft MS-DOS 6.0
and only .5% of the callers actually have a problem. Mr.Bill said so.

However, MicroSoft seems to have quietly slipstreamed in a revision to
SmartDrv in the form of v4.2 and can be found in many obscure places.
(oak.oakland.edu in pub/msdos/microsoft/pd0805.zip for one). As
everyone knows by now "pd" files are not "public domain" but
Mircrosoft's means to make quiet announcements. pd0645 contained the
CHKDSK fix for DOS 5.0.

>From a quick look, the only difference with v4.2 is that there is now
a /X switch to turn off write-caching to all drives and that if write-

For those who like to live dangerously, there is also a /N (Nuke ?)
switch that will disable the prompt flushing (somebody in Redmond must

ps ANFSCD: Every Ethernet adapter card sold has a 6 byte hardware address

   00:00:C0.xx.xx.xx, 3Com uses 02:60:8C.xx.xx.xx. Generally, the first
   three bytes seem to indicate the manufacturer, the next three the serial

I'd say this is at least as likely to be a false alarm as an
actual Datacrime infection.  Despite some hype at the time, the
Datacrime was never a widespread virus, and it's currently
just about extinct.  If the file(s) that your scanner accuses
are non-critical, you could erase or rename them, and see if
the "infection" ever shows up again.  If the files are
important, compare them to known-good originals and/or
contact your scanner's supplier about them and/or have
a guru take a look at them in DEBUG.  (Another possibility
is a new virus that your scanner happens to pick up

LAT is an acronym that means Lambdin's Accuracy tests where I test
anti-virus software on my collection of viruses.

Here is the August 1993 LAT.

What is the Anthrax PT virus?  I just detected/cleaned it off my

have any information on this?

Subject: New version of F-PROT released (PC)

I just uploaded to oak.oakland.edu a new version of F-PROT, named 2.09d.

It detects several new viruses, including one (SatanBug), which has been
reported "in the wild", and also disinfects a few viruses that 2.09 could
only detect, in particular the Chinese Fish.

Finally, it corrects a problem when disinfecting an infected MBR, where 2.09
would sometimes say it was unable to locate the original MBR.

P.S.  I haven't seen any postings on comp.virus for more than a week - I am
wondering if this is the same problem as earlier this summer, where VIRUS-L
worked OK, but comp.virus didn't make it properly across the Atlantic.

[Moderator's note: The admins of the mail to news gateway have been
notified, and are checking into the problem.]

(by the way, a totally non-virus-related subject - I am wondering if there
is anybody in the Sausalito area reading this, who could do me a small favour
.please email)

Subject: Multipartite - con (CVP)

DEFGEN8.CVP   930817

                        Multipartite - con

Multipartite, or "dual infection", viral programs have the potential
to infect both program files and boot sectors.  This expands the
range of possible vectors.  Multipartite infections can
theoretically travel on any disk, and multiple copies may travel on
a disk if program files are present.  Dual infectors can also travel
on networks, and via files passed over bulletin board systems and
other communications channels.

Are multipartite infectors a terrible new threat?  Well, no.
They've been around for a few years now.  Why haven't they "taken
over the world"?

There are disadvantages to multipartite viral programs as well as
advantages.  One of the major ones is complexity.  In file
infectors, one sees a number of viri which only infect one type of
program files, an MS-DOS COM file, for example.  A virus which
infects both COM and EXE files must generally have more than twice
the code of one which infects COM files alone.  The virus must not
only know how to deal with both file types, but also how to
distinguish between the target files.  The same logic holds true for
multipartite infectors.  The virus must carry with it the means to
infect two radically different types of targets, and the means to
identify two very different types of potential hosts.  The potential
size of the program is much larger, as is the requirement for
processing.  The multipartite virus can be reduced in size, but this
generally means a reduction in function as well.

The "choice" of targets might seem to be an easy matter, but the
reality is slightly more complex.  The most effective means of
spreading would be a "get everything" policy, but this might also
lead to conflicts and detection.  Some programs might choose to
alternate:  a program infection would infect boot sectors, and a
boot sector infection would infect program files.  Seems reasonable,
until you realize the this merely makes the virus sequentially a BSI
*or* a file infector, in alternating generations.  Statistically,
this means that it will be slightly less effective than a boot
virus, rather than more.

Ultimately the failure (perhaps "non-success" would be more
accurate) of multipartite viral programs points out a very
interesting fact.  None of the new viral technologies; stealth,
polymorphism, spawning, etc. seem to have much "survival value".
The successful infectors tend to be the older ones, simple and
basic.  This is not to say that the virus threat is dying.  Stoned
has been around since 1988, and is still infecting more systems each
year.  Simple.  But effective.
