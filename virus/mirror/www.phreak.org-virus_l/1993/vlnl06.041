You don't need self-modifying code to use polymorphism at install
time. All that happens is that the installation script takes what 
you might call the "canonical" form of the a-v executable and installs
it in a randomly permuted form. There'd be nothing "stronger" in a
polymorphic compiler. And [surely?] each user would need to use your
polymorphic compiler at each installation -- and a full compiler kit
is going to be a bit bulkier and more painful than an install utility!

Think about it -- most of today's install scripts permute the binaries
between original discs and the discs to which they're installing. Ever 
wondered how Borland C++ 3.x ships on as few [*gasp*] discs as it does?
The install discs read a compressed archive and spit out a whole 
directory tree with grillions of files onto the target disc. Same 
sort of idea as Vesselin's polymorphic installer...

We've just finished a clean-up at a client's site. They'd paid for and
received an a-v package _months_ ago -- largely, it would seem, because
of the hype about Michelangelo last year, which "heightened their awareness"
of viruses.

Well. The a-v software was in a cupboard [they had bought a corporate
licence for a good whack of PCs...], along with the upgrade discs that
had arrived by mail in the interim. The cupboard was locked [they were
playing safe to prevent piracy, I suppose...].

OK, we dug out the discs and started showing them how to install and
protect their site. And guess what? Michelangelo, all _over_ the show.
About 1000 infected floppies showed up -- luckily, a week before the
"deadline".

Yes. A trillion [the British sort, which is a _lot_] times Yes. Every time
there's a virus scare, and every time we get an escalation in the number
of calls for help [including people who _have_ been wiped out by virus 
onslaught], we get a corresponding escalation in the number of callers 
with dead or dying drives. Your drive _will_ fail!

Moral: back it up now. It can't wait.

Yes. Once again, when a specific virus [eg: Michelangelo] is being hyped
in the press, we get a substantial increase in calls for help with other
viruses. In other words, people are checking for viruses only when they're
panicked into it.

Moral: what's worth doing today is worth doing every day [see "Backup" :-)].

Oh, most of us are more intelligent than you expect... :-) We don't
believe that by not distributing viruses we'll make the virus problem
disappear. We do, however, believe firmly, that by distributing
viruses freely one makes the problem -worse-.

Well, maybe you have just not read carefully the articles on
comp.virus, or didn't ask the right questions. There are several virus
experts reading this newsgroup, who readily answer to all kinds of
questions about viruses. I dare to believe that the contents of the
newsgroup has educated at least some people about the virus problem.
Just reading the FAQ could prove valuable enough. Sorry if it hasn't
worked for you.

Education about viruses alone is not a silver bullet, as you seem to
imply in the above paragraph, but I agree with you that it is
important to educate the people about the problem - this always helps
to some extent to reduce the problem. However, this can always be done
without distributing virus code. The regular readers of this newsgroup
know that I am trying to answer any kinds of questions and to explain
every technical detail that it not clear enough. Yet, I have never
felt the need to publish virus code, in order to explain to some of
the readers what exactly the viruses are and how they work. Maybe
those who insist that publishing virus code is necessary for user
education about viruses just do not command their own language well
enough to communicate that information in simple words...

Problem is, from my point of view, I am not able to evaluate (a) how
competent exactly you are (I've seen even experts doing silly things
when dealing with viruses) and (b) that your purposes are legitimate.
Look, I -want- to believe you, but I have no way to know it for sure,
thus I simply refuse to take the (unnecessary) risk.

This could be put in a slightly different way: I have no way to
determine that you, and the rest of you, are as knowledgeable about
virus code as it is necessary, therefore, I refuse to take the
responsibility to give virus code to you. Besides, if you are so
knowledgeable, why do you need the virus code in the first place?

Well, that's exactly what I am doing. So, what's your problem, then?

But I don't think so! Just the opposite, I am always willing to
explain what the different viruses do, what can be done against it,
and so on. By no means I am keeping the general public ignorant.
Actually, some people are accusing me for being too open... However, I
do keep the viruses themselves from the general public... And the
general public from the virus code... :-)

A heavy-sounding and pompous phrase, but completely unfounded. You
probably don't know me well, otherwise you would know that I do not
sell any anti-virus program, a few utilities I've written are
available for free, and people do not pay me consultation fee when I
am answering their questions... In fact, I am taking your suggestion
as an insult.

> The "censor it and it'll fix it" attitude is not that of everyone. 

As I wrote above, my attitude is more exactly "don't censor it and the
problem will become worse".

Maybe we just happen to have different understanding of what true
education is? And, if the people that you mean are those running virus
exchange BBSes - well, I don't see them to be (a) knowledgeable (gosh,
most "virus collections" on them are such a horrible mess... Those
people can't tell CHKDSK from a virus...), or (b) very helpful and
effective to reduce the problem. Just the opposite - because of them
every scanner must bother to check for obscure viruses that have never
been found in the wild, but are present on those BBSes, so any
malevolent person could download them and infect somebody's machine...
What a valuable contribution to the society, isn't it? And how it
helps to "educate" those people who have urgent work to do and don't
want to bother to convert their machine into the electronic equivalent
of Fort Knox...

So what ?  Remember - for any decent scanner the speed does (almost) not
depend on the number of viruses.  Creating 4 scanners will simly mean that
the time will increase by a factor of 4, if you ran them all - and any one
of them would be of the same speed as the original one.  

Remember, not all scanners are turtles...

This is not very convenient from the user's point of view... But the
idea could be changed a bit to achieve practically the same thing -
there could be one scanner, with many overlays. The users will be able
to select how "secure" they want their scanner to be, thus selecting
which of the overlays will be executed during the scanning process.
However, the differentiation does not to be by stealth/encrypted/etc.
it only needs to be based on how common the viruses are.

This will be much like the today's option in many scanners for
"secure"/"turbo" scanning mode, the former usually meaning that the
whole file is scanned, while the latter means that only those places
of the files are checked, where a virus is likely to be present.

Like Gerry Santoro, I also am getting seeing strange behavior on
WordPerfect.  In this case, running on a 3+Share LAN with a Zenith
386SX/20 station, the text was replaced by random characters.  The
cursor freezes and the only soIution is a cold reboot with a complete
loss of text (the backup was blank).  Is this a WordPerfect problem?
F-PROT 2.07 did not find anything.

I can attest to the fact that F-Prot & Stacker coexist just dandy.  I've
been using the two of them together for about a year now, and haven't
run into any problems.

Don't know 'bout CPAV, though -- I've never tried it.  Why pay such a large
amount of money, when I can get a product which I consider superior for
free?

I agree that CARO names tend to be somewhat unwieldly for "general" reporting,
which is part of the reason I suggested to frisk a /CARO command-line switch
rather than ALWAYS including them.  Perhaps only the tail end of the CARO name
could be used by default?  For example, report Jerusalem.AntiCAD.4096.Mozart
as "Mozart".  If ambiguity results, back up the chain until it is unambiguous.

Another possibility would be to limit reported names to a certain number of
characters.  I agree that seeing "Dark_Avenger.2000.Traveller.Zopy" pop up on
the screen while scanning could panic out an unsuspecting individual.
Reporting this virus as "Rocko" seems a bit TOO brief.  Viruses with shorter
names like Cascade.1704.A should be reported in full, as this seems short
enough not to cause a panic.

The users that I have worked with tend to be rather curious about the viruses
they find.  The first question I get right after "Which one was it?" is
typically "What does it do?"  Without proper identification of the virus
I can't answer this fully.  Fortunately, with F-prot answering this question is
pretty easy, but it would be nice to give more details.

I tend to agree.  A TSR scanner need not have super-precise identification.
Just giving the family should be plenty.  (I.e. "Jerusalem" or "Dark_Avenger".)
Save the down and dirty identification for the non-TSR scanners.

This is why the CARO standard uses the heirarchical format.  It is easy to add
variants to a base name.

>Do you know how manny variant of

Another reason for using a standard.  Without a standard and careful checking
a potentially harmful variant can get mis-identified as a less harmful
parent virus, take Stoned and Michelangelo for instance.

>Doeas it cause any problem in 
>cleaning these viruses from an infected site even if their name is simply "
>Jerusalem-B" ?

People tend to want to know what the virus does, so they can be on the lookout
for the future, or just out of curiosity.  For example, if a person just
recovered from a massive infection of Jerusalem, they might notice that some 
of their executables keep growing and growing earlier than if they had no 
idea what the virus did.

People tend to be curious, perhaps in a large office workplace a busy boss
might just want to get the damn things out, but people at home might want to
learn a bit more about what their new "friend" is capable of.  Proper ID is
essential for this.

Yes, and if he doesn't like the name, he changes it.  This way nobody really
knows exactly what they have. :(  I certainly wouldn't consider the
information in VIRLIST.TXT anything more than decorative.  It is close to
impossible to cross-reference to any substantial information list.  It does
cross reference to VSUM pretty well, but I wouldn't trust the information in
VSUM as far as I could spit it.  But I've discussed that enough... ;->

I also wouldn't say that "everyone" uses McAfee's VIRLIST.TXT. :-)

Huh ? 

You are misunderstanding something.  When Virstop finds a virus, it STOPS the
virus - it is never executed, and therefore it cannot "lead to further
infection".  The virus code may be read into memory, of course - Virstop
has to read parts of the file, in order to perform a scan, but the code is
inactive.

Payload [I prefer Roger Riordan's term "warhead", actually, as payloads

Quite true. Interestingly, the COMMAND.COM which comes with 
Digital Research's DR-DOS 6.0 is an .EXE file -- but I suppose
that they realised people are _very_ used to the file called
"commandcom" and that COMMAND.EXE would be a stressful culture

We had just an outbreak of a virus that infects the partition table.
It trigger on any date in March. Reformatting the hard disk and
running fdisk, changing everything, has no effect. You have to low

that a high level format from a clean , booted floppy would be enough

Subject: Mutating Engine concerns (PC)

I am curious if any of the experts out there can help me out here. I am 
concerned about the possibility of getting hit with one of these with our 
current level of protection, we are installing NAV 2.1 after using Certus 
for some time with constant problems with virus infections. A big concern 
for us is memory at the wotkstation since we are running Lanman 2.1 there 
isn't room for some of the larger TSR's that seem to offer better protection 
against unknown virus technology. At this point we cannot consider a 
different antivirus product at the workstation due to the fact that money 
has already been spent on NAV so what I am concerned about is what sort of 
threat to the mutating engine type virus pose at this point? We are always 
getting the usual collection such as Yankee Doodle,Dark Avenger,Stoned, 
Liberty and Michelangelo. Our company has alot of data being moved around on 
floppies which cannot be changed so I am a bit concerned since we definatly 
have seen that they get brought in on a regular basis. Any help in this area 
would be greatly appreciated.

It will actually work with almost any non-stealth file infector.
Nevertheless, attaching integrity modules to the executable files is
not a good idea. First of all, there are files to which you must not
attach anything, or they will break. Such files include Windows
applications, EXE files with internal overlay structure, very big COM
files, programs, containing debugging information (e.g., symbol
tables), and so on. It is much better to store the information about
those files in an external database and run an external program to
check it.

Unfortunately, this is not true. There are lots of issues that have
still to be considered, like implementing the CRC correctly (if you
use a fixed algorithm, a virus could forge it), like taking into
account the possible virus attacks against integrity programs
(described in my paper; plug), and so on. You should be EXTREMELY
careful, when speaking about catching ANY virus...

I think you are talking about different things there. The original
poster seems to refer to resident scanners (unless I'm mistaken).
Resident scanners can catch KNOWN viruses before those viruses get any
chance to run, so obviously they won't be able to remove the scanner
from memory. Of course, if it is a new virus, the scanner will not
detect it (if it is only a scanner), but then it is useless for the
virus to remove the scanner from memory - it doesn't stop the virus
anyway, so why bother?

80 bytes? So many? :-) Well, I don't remember what exactly the program
did when it used to be called "TNTVIRUS", but VSafe that comes with
CPAV can be removed from memory with just 8 bytes of code... :-(

What is the problem with the EXE files? This virus is a Jerusalem
variant and it simply appends itself to the EXE files... Disinfecting
them shouldn't be a problem, except that the file size might remain up
to 15 bytes bigger than the original...

But, anyway, why re-inventing the wheel? There are already several
anti-virus programs which are able to disinfect both types of files
from this virus... I just made a quick test of F-Prot 2.07, CLEAN 102,
and FindVirus 6.15. Here are the results.

First of all, there are several closely related variants of this
virus. Those of them that I know are:

	(1) Jerusalem.Zerotime.Australian.A
	(2) Jerusalem.Zerotime.Australian.B
	(3) Jerusalem.Scot's_Valley

Virus #:   F-Prot:            CLEAN:             FindVirus:
- --------   -------            ------             ----------
(1).COM    Disinfects         Disinfects         Does not disinfect
(1).EXE    Disinfects         Disinfects         Does not disinfect
(2).COM    Does not disinfect Does not recognize Does not disinfect
(3).COM    Disinfects         Does not disinfect Does not disinfect
(3).EXE    Disinfects         Does not disinfect Does not disinfect

As usual, F-Prot is best in disinfecting viruses, while FindVirus
provides exact identification. CLEAN calls the virus (1) "Slow [Slow]"
and the virus (3) "Scott's [2133]". It doesn't detect at all the virus
(2), F-Prot calls it "New variant of Zerotime", and FindVirus calls it
"TPE" (?!).

Don't be so quick to underestimate the interests of the common user.
When this user asks for assistance, it is not very helpful if he tells
you "The product XYZ found the Generic Boot virus on my machine. How
to remove this virus and what the hell does it do?"... I agree that
the two most important questions for the user are "Am I infected?" and
"If I am, how to get rid of it?", but the third most important
question is "What has it done to my data?"... If it were not like
that, everybody would use an integrity checker, instead of scanners -
the integrity checker tells you that you are infected, and often can
repair the infection, but is unable to identify the virus and to tell
you what else to expect...

> You would very much like to have a scanner that

Yes, that's it! S/he wants to know -what- disease s/he has - what
exactly. I do not claim that a full genealogic name must be supplied -
but the name must be -unique- and -exact-. When designing the CARO
naming scheme we found helpful to group the viruses according to their
code similarities. This grouping is reflected in the full CARO name of
a virus. Of course, you don't need to specify the full name each time,
it is enough to use a part that identifies a virus uniquely. For
instance, you can say just Mummy.1_2, if you know that this virus is
part of the Jerusalem family. The full path is needed only when
communicating the information to somebody else who does not have this
knowledge (maybe he has not heard about the Mummy viruses at all). So,
by telling him that you are talking about Jerusalem.Mummy.1_2, you are
communicating not only information sufficient to identify the virus in
the naming hierarchy - you are also telling him that the virus is part
of the Jerusalem family (thus, might infect files in a similar way),
that it has several variants (this particular one is 1_2) and so on.
Consider the alternative to just telling him that you are talking
about the "Mummy" virus. Which Mummy? What does it do?...

> What is the purpose of telling the virus name in a TSR. Is it not
> enough to tell the user "You've got a problem, Check it !" ?

Alas, it isn't. Most users insist in obtaining the information
instantly, NOW!, when the virus is about to infect their machine. They
don't like the idea to spend a few minutes in powering down the
machine, running an off-line scanner that takes 3 minutes just to
check itself, and so on...

Yes, definitively.

How many? Usually, when a new variant appears, we learn about it
pretty quickly... Gosh, we receive averagely several new viruses every
day... And, if we don't know about some obscure variant, then the
scanner won't catch it (the scanners catch only known viruses), so no
need to bother about the fact that the virus is not yet named...

> Doeas it cause any problem in 
> cleaning these viruses from an infected site even if their name is simply "
> Jerusalem-B" ?

Yes, it does. A lot. The different variants are, unfortunately, er...
different. :-) You cannot remove them in exactly one and the same way.
And, removing the wrong variant can be (and often is) disastrous! Of
course, we keep saying that infected files shouldn't be disinfected,
but replaced with clean copies instead, however, the users keep using
disinfection programs... For that purpose, we need exact
identification.

Besides, people often use more than one anti-virus product. If two
products report two different names, this enforces the general
confusion. Sometimes it is even worse - one product reports more than
one virus  when only one is present... And so on...

Then, according to your logic, why don't you call all of them just
"Virus"? Why do you still use names (and many different ones) in your
scanner? Problem is, the users want to know -what- is on their system.
You cannot just tell them "This seems to be one of the many Jerusalem
variants" - they want to know whether it will delete files on Friday
the 13th, or will format the disk in year 2000, or whatever.

Argh, you used a bad example... First, there are many names in
VIRLIST.TXT that SCAN never reports - they are left there from
previous versions. Second, there are many names that SCAN reports, but
which are not in VIRLIST.TXT. Third, there are many different viruses
that SCAN reports with one and the same name (e.g., both
Number_of_the_Beast and Compiler.1 are reported as "512 [512]").
Fourth, there are many closely related viruses that SCAN reports with
completely different names. Fifth, for many viruses SCAN reports more
than one virus in the infected file, while only one is present.

Naw, I wouldn't use VIRLIST.TXT as a reliable reference for virus
names...

> If a new virus appears that is not

How nice and simple, isn't it? I begin to wonder - how often do you
receive new viruses? There are dozens that do just nothing particular,
except replicate! How do you pick a name for them? A numeric name is
not good, because people have difficulties remembering numeric
names... We used to name them after trees, after fishes, after the
first object we could think about, after the secretary's dog,
after.... But with a dozen or so new viruses every week your fantasy
begins to exhaust itself...
