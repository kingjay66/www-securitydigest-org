Could somebody check how exactly the DLL and DRV files are loaded in
OS/2? The only reason that "some viruses can infect overlays" is that
they infect on INT 21h/AH=4Bh, instead of INT 21h/AX=4B00h. Since some
overlays are loaded with INT 21h/AX=4B03h, a sloppy written virus
could infect them by mistake. How are the DLL and DRV files loaded in
OS/2? If they are not loaded using any INT 21h/AX=4Bxxh function, then
it is rather unlikely that any of the currently known viruses will
infect them...

A minor nit picking - Stoned displays the message only when you are
booting from a floppy. It is unlikely that OS/2 will be often booted

There is one more danger. If the virus is Michelangelo (which -is- a
Stoned-like virus; it is even a Stoned variant) and the current date
is March 6 - bye, bye hard disk, regardless of the operating system
installed on it... :-)

Like all boot sector viruses. if you didn't scan every diskette in the
building, the virus will probably come back sooner or later.

I have heard that Music Bug waits four months before the musical effects
start.

The tune is usually 36 notes long.

Vshield doesn;t go into EMS. It can be loaded high in upper memory blocks.

There are several problems with the integrity checking by Scan, and
Vshield.

1. Some programs will not run after the CRC is added to the file. So it is
   necessary to remove the CRC. Scan filename /RV will remove the CRC.

2. These CRCs will not detect stealth infectors because stealth viruses
   disinfects infected files when an infected file is opened for any
   reason.

3. These CRCs will not detect the presence of companion infectors because
   these companion infectors do not attach to files.

Jerusalem B is a file infector. It runs as a TSR, and will infect every
executable file you run except for .COM files larger than 62K. I believe
the virus is around 1800 bytes long.

McAfee's Clean can remove this virus fairly easy to remove. It would be a
very good idea to re-boot the computer from a known clean bootable
diskette. If you don't have a clean bootable diskette, go ahead and type
the following on the command line.

CLEAN C: [JERU]

after Clean gets finished, turn your computer off for a few seconds, then
back on. The reason for this is that since Jerusalem-B runs as TSR. After
the computer is clean, make a bootable diskette, then place a write
protect tab on the notch. Then the next time you have another virus, you
will be ready.

I hope this has been of help to you.

TPE seems to be from the Netherlands, according to my information...
There is already at least one virus that uses it; we are calling it
Girafe. TPE is smaller than MtE - about 1.6 Kb, compared to the 2.5 Kb
of MtE. At first look it seems indeed more polymorphic, because there
are no fixed things like JNZ backwards as in the decryptors generated
by the MtE. However, if you take a closer look, you'll see that it is
actually less polymorphic and if you ignore the noise instructions in
the decryptor, the total number of possible decryptors seems to be
less than in MtE... Of course, further analysis is needed in order to
confirm that.

Could you please elaborate -how- could SYS.COM cause destruction of
some FAT information? Assuming that you are using the same DOS version
your DOS partition is formatted with, of course. But even if you don't,
all damage I can think about is that your DOS partition could become

Well, Frisk's comments about your Virus Simulator turned out to be
right even after it appeared, so I would guess that he understands the
principles behind such "test" tools even better than you do...

Corrections: By "7S" you probably mean "Seventh_Son" ("7S" is how SCAN
calls it) and it is NOT based on MtE. "Dame" is not a virus, it is
just how SCAN call -all- MtE-based viruses. Gotcha is NOT an MtE-based
virus. Dunno what you are calling "Mut" but I know about no such
MtE-based virus. The CARO name for "MtE-Spawn" is "Insufficient". The
correct spelling of the last two names is "CryptLab" and "Encroacher".
"MtE" is not a virus; it is a tool for building polymorphic viruses.

When looking at the names you quoted, I am getting the impression that
you knowledge about the names of the existing MtE-based viruses is
based on the reports generated by SCAN, since it sometimes reports the
unencrypted variants of Pogue as "Gotcha" (which is correct - Pogue is
actually a Gotcha variant with MtE polymorphism added), and one of the
older versions of SCAN reported "7S" in some unencrypted variants of
one of the other MtE-based viruses (not certain about that; have to
check).

So, you are not only distributing malicious software (MtE) but also
real viruses, hmm? Anyway, Frisk's comment is still valid. The ability
of a scanner to detect "your" viruses may or may not be related to its
ability to detect -real- MtE-based viruses.

> Vigilant anti-virus programs that are capable  of  reliably

Usually, yes, but not necessarily. It depends on how your viruses
infect their victims, how often they are generating unencrypted
replicants, how exactly the particular scanner works, and so on. As I
said, it may or it may not be connected with the actual ability of the
scanner to detect the existing MtE-based viruses... But if a scanner
- -doesn't- detect some of "your" viruses, this is a serious reason for
further investigation. It does not necessarily mean that that
particular scanner will also miss a real MtE-based virus, but it is
worth checking why it misses your virus...

Cannot speak for all versions but the FDISK.EXE in MS-DOS 5.00
dated 3-22-91 is identical to that of 11-11-91 and both zero out all
the unused bytes between the end of the messages at absolute offset
0D9h and the beginning of the partition table at offset 1BEh.

Of course FDISK/MBR will not have *any* effect with any DOS before
5.00 so this may be the cause.

It is possible that PC-DOS or some other proprietary version or even
that there may be an "export" MS-DOS that might have the effect Roger
reports. (can only speak for what I have seen).

Please reply directly & I will summarize any verifiable exceptions.

Agree that FC produces a nicer (and unlimited length) output than COMP
but it was designed to compare text files and you have to remember to
use the /B switch on binaries or the check may terminate on the first
<EOF> marker. COMP, on the other hand, uses no intelligence, is much

when all that matters is "are the files identical?".

That's exactly what I am trying to tell you, but maybe I am not
expressing myself clearly enough. The Stoned+Michelangelo problem
occurs exactly because both viruses store the original MBR at ONE AND
THE SAME PLACE, therefore the original MBR gets lost. Such system
cannot be disinfected, because there is no original MBR. The only
solution is to put a new MBR, which the anti-virus program must carry
with itself. Of course, some care should be taken not to destroy any
PARTITION TABLE information.

Subject: Interesting Book

Over the holidays took a much-needed rest (family went to visit
cousins in Scotland & I was permitted to stay home 8*) & caught up on
some reading. One of the more interesting ones was *War in 2020* by
Ralph Peters.

Published in March of 1991 it missed the breakup of the Soviet Union
though the afterward makes it clear that the author was not surprised.

An interesting sub-plot developed late in the book was that high-tech
weaponry takes humans out of the tactical loop and relegates them to
strategic decisions. Further, if you can remove trust in the weapons
(virus etc.) you can destroy an adversary's capability to defend
himself.

Somewhere in the last few years we seem to have lost Heinlein's "tell
me three times" concept for trust and IMHO much of our difficulties
today stem from this.

ps In a modern PC disk information is stored in the CMOS, Partition Table
   and the DOS Boot Record. The code is trivial and given any two, the
   third can be easily reconstructed.

Any human-language definition will be inexact. For an exact definition
you should check his mathematical definition that involves Turing
machines... I think it is explained in his paper "Computational
Aspects of Computer Viruses", published in "Computers & Security". It
is also explained in his Ph.D. thesis (although the paper is better)
and is mentioned (without any explanation, which is rather confusing)
in his booklet "A Short Course on Computer Viruses".

No, you still do not understand. The "virus" is not just the login
script - it is the whole package. The login script is just the active
segment that seeks for "infectable" machines and transfers the rest of
the "virus code". It is actually a worm, but Cohen's definition does
not seem to make a difference between a virus and a worm.

Correct. So, the copy of the anti-virus package on the server
reproduces itself on each workstation when this workstation tries to
log in. Automatic update. Reproduction. Virus-like behavior.

> Is the login script programming trying to
> run around and find other login scripts or executable files to infect?

Another misunderstanding comes from the fact that most people
distinguish between a "virus" (i.e., something that modifies
executable files) and a "worm" (i.e., something that copies itself as
a whole). While it is useful to make such a distinguishment for
practical reasons, there is no real theoretical difference (e.g., what
"files" do the boot sector viruses infect? How about the companion
viruses? They do not modify anything...).

> No. It doesn't infect anyone! 'Damnit Jim, its not alive!'

Yup, it does. It "infects" the workstation with a copy of the
"virus/worm" - the anti-virus package.

Subject: Changes at ASP

        As of Jan.  1, 1993, ASP has decided to transfer all
maintenance, marketing, and other responsibility for all information
protection products currently made and marketed by ASP to outside
companies in which we have no financial interest.  We are therefore no
longer involved in the commercial aspects of protection software,
except for the licensing of basic technology developed at ASP.

        This transfer is being done in order to eliminate any
appearance of conflicts of interest with a new venture just started as
a joint project between Information Integrity and ASP - called:

                                  (tm)
                "Protection Experts   "

Subject: On the definition of viruses

        Computer viruses do not have to be malicious, they do not have
to be Trojan horses, and they do not have to enter without the
knowledge or consent of the user.  Any definition that depends on
these properties depends on peoples' opinions, skills, and knowledge,
and are thus not "testable" in the scientific sense of the word.  (See
Popper and others for more details).  For example:

        The "stoned" virus is not apparently malicious - perhaps
others do not agree - perhaps this is why we should not make our
definition depend on that property (i.e. peoples' opinions).  Is it a
virus for you but not for me?

        The "Brain" virus notifies you of its presence with a
copyright message displayed whenever you do a directory of an infected
disk.  It doesn't fit the Trojan horse definition by my understanding
if it announces itself.  Is it not a virus?

        If I know I am placing a Jerusalem virus in my computer, is it
not a virus?  It entered with my knowledge and consent, thus it is not
a virus by the third criterion above.  Is it a virus for you and not
for me?

        The mathematical definition first published in 1985 is
testable, and appears to properly differentiate viruses from
non-viruses.  Perhaps someone else wishes to do a better job, but
let's not make definitions that are senseless.

        So what is a computer virus? In simple terms, it is a sequence
of instructions that, when interpreted in an appropriate environment,
"replicates" in that at least one relica also "replicates", etc., ad
infinitum.

        Want an example? A backup program replicates by making an
exact copy of itself (if it does a good job) on the backup media.  In
many environemnts, you can run a program from the backup media (e.g.
a remote file system backup).  If you run the backup program from the
backup media, and it again replicates, etc., ad-infinitum, then it is
a virus! Suppose we put the backup program for DOS in an IBM
mainframe? in that environment, it would probably not be a virus,
because it wouldn't probably operate in the mainframe operating
environment.  Thus we see the intimate link between a virus and its
environment.  I don't want to waste more space here, but there is a
good deal more to know and think about in applying this definition.

On benevolent viruses:

        If a virus doesn't have to be malicious, perhaps the same
technology can be beneficial! When I published this idea in 1984 (in
the paper that first described viruses to the scientific community),
nobody commented on it, but when I published the results of 7 years of
research with benevolent viruses in The Sciences, I was very publicly
called a heretic.  The loudest complaints came from the academic
community! It seems they are not as open minded as they claim to be.
They were closely followed by the anti-virus industry, which has been
using the press to make money by claiming that all viruses are bad.
At least they have well understood motives.

        I don't so much mind that these people have their opinions,
everyone is entitled to that.  I do mind when they force their
opinions on others - for example, when they tell people to write
letters to The Sciences telling them that it is wrong to publish the
concept that viruses can be used for good, and when they claim that I
am telling people about the possibility of benevolent viruses only to
sell a product.  If that were true, I wouldn't publish my results, I
would only use them for my financial advantage.  It is certainly true
that the anti-virus vendors (which I am no longer one of) stand to
make money by convincing people that all viruses are bad and that they
are a major threat.

        Another upsetting example is the censure at the DPMA, ACM,
IEEE Annual Computer Virus and Security Conference held in New York
each March.  In this conference, they blank out portions of papers and
provide full text only to conference attendees.  So if I publish
details of benevolent virus techniques and how to make them safe, only
the attendees will see the details, and the paper will look like swiss
cheese.

Does the fairness doctrine apply to electronic media? Do the DPMA,
IEEE, and ACM have such a lock on research in the computer field in
the US that we allow their censorship to prevent us from hearing about
ideas that aren't popular? Do the universities support this censorship
of ideas? Do they do it for grant money in computer security? (They
must be pretty hard up if the grant money in this field is enough to
sway them into anything.)

        Maybe this posting is about a little bit more than just
viruses.  It seems to me that censorship in all its forms leads to
ignorance and all of it's evils.  To quote Maxwell Smart: "If only
they could have used their power for goodness instead of evil."

        I am glad that other people who read virus-l don't rule out
the possibility of benevolent viruses.  I'm sad that so many virus-l
readers have been misled about the true meaning of viruses.  I'm even
sadder that our university people in the US don't think that new and
different ideas are good and decide to try to censure them.  I'm
really glad that I no longer sell virus defenses, because I think it's
a pretty shady business (except for a few good companies that tell the
truth about viruses and their products).
