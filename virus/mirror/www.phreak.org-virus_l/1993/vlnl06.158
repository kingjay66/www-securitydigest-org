Subject: Vessselin-L (Philosophy)

In 6.154, Vesselin makes quite a number of points most of which have a
common factor. Laws are usually made by Sheep to protect them from the
Wolves since they cannot protect themselves. Occasionally the Wolves
take over in which case you get the repressions Vesselin alluded to
provided the chief Wolf practices the first law of political survival:
"After the revolution, shoot the revolutionaries".

Even so, it is rare for a dictatorship to last beyond two generations
unless other factors are operating - the third generation just is not
hungry enough.

Laws then are generally enacted as a reaction to natural and self-centered
impulses. Whether pro or con depends on who happens to be in charge.

With the Internet, suddenly we have worldwide (well close to) communications
that, for the moment, are essentially unrestricted. As a consequence,
cultural conflict is inevitable.

For the moment, the bulk of the population is wolvish in nature. I'net
access is something that must be mastered to a certain extent and it is
much easier to gain a usenet feed than to create a POP-Mailer.

Personally, I do not believe that anti-virus legislation will work - we
(the "experts") cannot even decide what a virus is. Malicious activity
could be legislated against, particularly if it causes damage, but then
to be effective it must be enforced and this is the hard part.

The gun analogy IMHO is a bad one. A gun is a physical object that can only
be in one place at a time. It is legally traceable. Software such as a virus
has no such restriction any more than an idea does. Against a disease,
containment is the only solution and the world in 1993 is proving unwilling
to practise effective containment against real diseases so it is unlikely
to do so against soft ones.

This discussion is going on in one group concerning the virus boards and
their publications. Since these contain actual virus source code, it was felt
that while an FTP site in one country might be against the law, in another
it would be perfectly legal and as far as net access is concerned, it really
does not make any difference where it is.

Thus countries have three options:
1) Seal the borders (but can it be done electronically ?)
2) Customs Inspections (possible but would take massive computing power
   to check everything including .ZIPs and .UUEs to say nothing of
   encryption.
3) Do nothing and hope it goes away (the usual political answer today).

In the future, I expect the "free ride" to stop and the Internet to become
a toll road. (not what I want to see but what I expect) *This* will have
more of a stifling effect than any attempt to quarentine.

IMHO the IRS (Internal Revenue Service - Inland Revenue to those in the UK)
would be much more effective against drug traffic than the DEA - just look
at the violent reaction the Surgeon General got for suggesting it and the
speed which Billiary distanced from the idea - would put a big crimp in a lot
of cash flow.
- ---------------
The dual-state nature of networks and PCs is something I've been pushing for a
few years now and while a "Guardian" would certainly be possible, IMHO it
just would not work. A PC is single state and I can make it respond to
anything properly, whether or not I am actually complying.

It is interesting to see someone else pointing out that "if I own the
server, you either play by my rules or you don't play". I am able to
monitor *everything* and whether or not I do is at *my* discretion. Further,
should I decide to monitor, *you* will never know it unless I tell you.

This is neither fair nor unfair, it just is a fact. Anyone who does not
want this to occur can take their toys elsewhere. Lately there have been
a couple of court cases, a DOJ advisory, and even a segment on L.A.Law
dealing with it but the bottom line concerns ownership of property in this
country. To say otherwise would not only involve deprivation but also
(an more importantly) free the system owner from "due care" requirements.
(No, I am not a lawyer and the sad thing in this country is that I feel
required to say so...).

One thing I am certain of: this will not change in the near future and the
only thing that monitoring warnings are going to do is to keep you from having
to go to court in the first place (not a small thing though).

Point is that the way our society is stuctured (and through extension, the
Internet population), viruses are going to spread. Easily. And legislation
will have no effect on it other than to tie up resources better used
elsewhere. The responsibility for controlling viruses must rest with the
system owners and the only means is adequate defenses at every point of entry.

Can it be done ? Yes. Can it be done without effort ? No. Will many ? No.
Sheep, being sheep, cannot protect themselves from wolves, you need a
sheep-dog for that (and a good one is not much removed from a wolf). What
sheep do a lot of is bleat.

Subject: Possible virus (PC)

Whenever our PCs have a problem the first thing we think of is a virus.

Several machines (both 386 & 486) have developed a severe case of
cross-linked files and may or not reboot subsequently.  They are not
necessarily from the same manufacturer;  all are running windows 3.1 but
are not necessarily set up in the same way.

On campus the most prevalent viruses are Spanish Telecom & Form but neither
of these can be detected on affected machines nor is any other virus found.

If anyone has any thoughts or suggestions we would be very grateful.

Subject: Info needed on HideNowt Virus. (PC)

I recently encountered the HideNowt Virus in a couple of our PC Clones.
This was found when running Vshield during startup. Actually Vshield was
one of the infected programs, and it alerted us to the fact that something
was wrong.  To double check I ran F-prot 2.09f and this reported the
HideNowt (?)  Virus. It could not remove the virus, so I know I have to
delete and restore the infected files. No problem there.

So My question is: What is the HideNowt Virus, how does it travel, what
files will it infect ? I looked through F-prot's Virus Info and there was
nothing available there.  I don't remember seeing this crossing the list,
so I'm looking thru the back issues of Virus-l and the FAQ just in case I
missed something.

Subject: MBR/FBR viruses (PC)

Once more I am seeing an incredible number of people talking about
not being able to use FDISK/MBR for MBR viruses (usu because they still
do not have DOS 5) and SYS not working for floppies. This is exactly why
I wrote the FixMBR/FixMBR pair of FREEWARE programs (now in FixUtil6). True
there are other commercial versions (with the logo of the purchaser and some
other options) but the basic capability is there for the effort of a
downloaded .ZIP.

While considerably more capable than FDISK/MBR (FixMBR will search for the
original and tell you if everything looks ok) or SYS for a floppy (FixFBR
just repairs the boot record - no boot files needed) there is a caveat,
corruption caused by a virus is not corrected - but then the same can
be said about FDISK or SYS.

No not quite: with FixMBR you can put the disk back the way it was if the
fix doesn't work. You can't with FDISK.

Along the same lines DiskSecure II v2.4 should be out this weekend with a
major change: It will now be free to individuals (though a postcard would be
nice) and otherwise available only on a site licensing basis. See the .DOCs
for details.

In the 5 day delay between when I posted, and when my post showed up
in news, I have found out that my PC had the Monkey virus. The best
way to remove it is with an excellent program called KILLMONK. I am
sorry, but I do not know where this is available on the net, I got it
from someone local. Again, I would like to point out that Mcafee SCAN,
Nortan Antivirus, Microsoft Antivirus (all latest versions) all failed
to see it at all. F-PROT 2.10 did see something, but mis-identified it
as a new varient of stoned. Hope this helps someone else out there.

I want to know if F-PROT 2.10 is as effective running in a
DOS Window (Windows 3.1).  I have created a PIF to run a
batch file which calls F-PROT.  I am just checking a
floppy disk(s).  I do not want to exit Windows nor do
I trust MS virus software as much as F-PROT.

Subject: New virus (PC)???

One of our computers apparantly has a (harmless?) virus - the users download
biological data/progs from a network, and occasionally while running some
standard application (WP 5.1), the message "GENE!"  appears in the upper left
corner of the screen...  I have run both F-PROT 2.10 and SCAN 9.20 V109
from a clean disk after a clean boot and find nothing (including
using heuristic searching), but the resident copy of f-prot prints a
corrupted program warning when run...

Suggestions?  Heckling from the audience?

Subject: 'Anti-viral' Viruses (PC).

I'm working on a final year research project investigating 'useful'
computer viruses.  The project aims to assess the feasibility of
incorporating simple anti-virus tools into virus code. I've seen
mention of such viruses once or twice on this newsgroup and
wondered if anybody has any information or ideas that they think
I might find useful.

I am aware of the moral implications underlying such viruses.

        Thanks.....

I ended up having to do the setup procedure 3 times to get all of the
files updated.   I had numerous files that had changed subtly because
I had used an executbale packer and unpacker on various programs.  The
6.2 set up requires complete originals.   After re-installing the
exact originals from ms-dos 6.0 the set-up program ran just fine without

You could have booted from a DOS 5.0 formatted system disk which has
a copy of fdisk (and is write protected, of course :) ) and then used
fdisk /mbr, or you could also use a program called, "setver"

Subject: Windows viruses? (PC)

I've been following Virus-L for about 6 months now, and this is my
first post! :)  Someone on a local BBS just told me that a Windows
Zine reported 2 Windows viruses.  I asked what the viruses were
supposed to do, but I didn't get a reply.  I hadn't remembered
hearing about any "true" Windows viruses so I checked the FAQ.

        Quoted from FAQ.Virus-L  18 November 1993 update

What is the name of that one?  The names that I was given are:
        Winvir and Twitch.
I looked in the F-PROT definitions, but they weren't listed.  I
figure it might just be a stretch on the part of the journalist to
define a "Windows virus".

Good point; one I have to concede.  With the exploding numbers of

IMO, you're doing a fine job making time available to post the advice
here on comp.virus.  How's the dissertation coming?  Are you considering
posting it here or putting it up for anon ftp when it is complete?
I know that a lot of people would be interested in reading it.

BTW, have you done any work on Windows NT or NT AS vis a vis resistance
to viruses?  Do you need a copy of either for testing?

Yes, VIRSTOP will display this message, but not on all types of videocards.
More important however, is that VIRSTOP stops execution and copying (if
you use the /COPY switch) of infected files, even is you are using MS-Windows.
You will then get a "access denied" message from Windows.
The commercial version of F-PROT, F-PROT professional, has a built in
Windows device-driver that handle messages in Windows.

How about using a better A-V product .......

Can anyone give me information on the FORM virus?  Norton Anti-Virus
detects it, but does not remove it.

If possible please fax this info. to 011-813-5276-9884, attn.: Ted
Matsumura,

However, I will try to check into this group from Japan somehow.  Thanks.

Use Fscan.  It aborts when F-Prot detects a virus.

Hallo, Hi, HOLA All!

SDSCAN is sometimes not able to check an archive include in an archive.
This is due tio the amount of memory needed to expand the files.
It checks all files on Disk and Netware Volumes, which are not in use (locked)
or password protected.

I recently used it to check disinfected floppies (ParB). They could not clean
it automatically but gave the advice to use SYS A:

I just released a new version.  The main reason was to fix a false alarm in
2.10 (Keypress virus in a program called EMSLOAD.EXE), but we also added
identification/detection/disinfection of 50 new viruses or so.

I am right now uploading the program to the usual distribution sites (primarily
oak.oakland.edu).

I obviously spoke too soon.  Today - the user (a department manager)
infected disks with stoned and then proceded to install it on two new
hard drives.  He had a scanner available, he just didn't use it
because "they were the original disks".  Sigh. We've had one
experience of receiving disks from a vendor that were infected. That
wasn't the problem this time.  He had brought an infected disk with
data on it from home and booted the machine with the disk in. I've
fixed them so they won't boot from A, but I find it frustrating that I
can't seem to get everyone to follow a simple procedure: 1) scan it
2)write-protect it 3) back it up to a clean disk 4) *then* install the
software.  Now wouldn't it be nice if I could find some way to charge
off my time to *his* department?

                        Getting Information

My ego does not extend so far that I think this is the only source
of information on viral programs that you will ever need.  I am only
too well aware of the limitations of my material.  Having reviewed
most of the rest, however, I am also aware of their limitations.

I perhaps overstated the case regarding the necessity for online
information sources, but not by much.  There are two monthly
journals, Virus Bulletin and Virus News International.  Both are for
the very serious researcher, and academic in tone, with subscription
prices in the $150 to $250 range.  (My own V.I.R.U.S. Monthly and
V.I.R.U.S. Weekly, unfortunately, fall into a similar price range,
although concentrating more on news and gossip.)  Of the two, VB has
somewhat the higher reputation and promotes an annual conference
which also has a good name.  Be aware, though, that both
publications have links to product vendors, and thus product reviews
may be slightly suspect.

Other vendors produce newsletters on a less ambitious scale.  The
ones I have seen here had very sporadic publication schedules and
very little information of value, being confined to announcements of
new product releases.  In any case, you have to be a customer to get
the mailings.

You will probably want information on the various specific viral
programs.  This is a constant battle, given the thousands of known
viral programs and variants, and the hundreds of new ones produced
each month. In the MS-DOS world, the reference usually mentioned
first is the "Virus Summary List" maintained by Patricia Hoffman.
This is a shareware data base, which goes under the name
VSUMXymm.ZIP, where ymm is the last digit of the year and a two-
digit month.  Thus, VSUMX309.ZIP is the file for September, 1993.
VSUM is probably the most extensive list of MS-DOS viral programs,
but has an unfortunate reputation for inaccuracy.  A rival program,
the "Virus Information Door," is suspected of being linked to virus
exchange groups and is, in any case, almost unavailable apart from a
direct call to the author's BBS.  An alternate source of information
is the good, but aging, list in "PC Viruses" by Alan Solomon
(published by Springer-Verlag).  An updated and more comprehensive
version is contained in the documentation for "Dr. Solomon's Anti-
Virus Toolkit."

For Mac users, there is a hypertext virus encyclopedia which should
be available on many boards.  However, for any of the other
microcomputer systems, or for the most accurate listings, the best
source is the "Computer Virus Catalog" produced by staff associated
with the Computer Antivirus Research Organization (CARO) and the
Virus Test Center (VTC), and available from the ftp site at the
University of Hamburg.  This has had unfortunately limited
distribution outside of the Internet, and is quite restricted in the
number of MS-DOS samples catalogued, but is generally most reliable.
