Good idea.  Even if the FBI can't stop this type of activity, it is
a red flag of sorts.  Their computer crime division is a lot more active
than you'd think.  I'd be willing to bet that while you're reading this,

The editor is not the worry.  It's the bozos in the field who put this
kind of information to use that scare the %^&*@# out of me.  If one
subscriber gets caught, though, the rest will get the idea that big

Well, I've found the Chaos Digest mentionned, and had a look at it...
Too bad, but the only things that could be considered as encrypted are
some source of viruses in a debug form.  Concerning encryption, if my
memory is good (you can doubt about it if you want), you can't
transfer encrypted data on a public media (phone lines for example)
without an authorization from the government. Of course, they never
controled what is exchanged by BBS, and for sure people are mainly
transferring ZIPped files... but this is not encrypted.  However, I
don't think that it could be possible to prevent the diffusion and the
publication of such a magazine in France.

So the significant changes are that:

   1. We will have a bigger committee, with even greater
      potential for chaos.

   2. Dick Lefkon will no longer officially be in charge, but
      Judy Brand (who we understand is Dick's wife) will
      continue to act as Conference Chair.

Each delegate to the recent conference paid a registration fee
ranging from $325 to $425.  If we add a conservative $200 for
accomodation and travel, and $400 for two days pay, and we assume
that there were 500 paying delegates (in the absense of any
reliable information on the subject) the total cost of this
conference was almost certainly well in excess of $500,000.

If any individual had paid this amount for a service which failed
as spectacularly as this conference did they would certainly take
legal action.  Unfortunately it would be difficult to establish
just how much loss the delegates had suffered, and difficult for
any individual to take action.  However the registration form
clearly stated "Registration includes Proceedings, ... ".  As
these are valued (by the organisers) at $100 per copy, the
organisers are in clear breach of contract to the tune of
something like $50,000.

It is now 11 weeks since the conference, when we were promised we
would receive them "Tomorrow", then "they will be posted first
thing next week", and 7 weeks since I was promised them "in a
few weeks", but still no one has received them.

Despite all this Ms Brand appears to think that the organisers
can make a few cosmetic changes and continue as before.  Is
there anyone, or any organisation, who/which is in a position
to ensure firstly that the organisers meet their legal obligations
with respect to the Proceedings, and secondly that they are not
permitted to attempt to repeat this fiasco?

I thought ; is that possible to have battery backupped virus ?
As I know there are some unallocated memory for setups and
chipset use.
Moreover, as I recall Chip&Techs chipset have over 30 kb

Perhaps you're thinking of the Azusa virus?   The CANSU keeps a copy
of the original boot record (more specifically, of the 40 bytes of
it that it alters), and uses it to boot the machine normally once
it has run.  The main oddish thing about CANSU is that it's slightly
polymorphic ("oligomorphic"), which is unusual for a boot virus.

You probably don't have a virus.  Removing VSAFE will do the trick -
it leaves various virus fragments in memory, and one of them just
happens to match the search pattern SCAN uses.  I suggest you complain
to Microsoft about the problem, as this is entirely their (and Central
Point's) fault.

I cannot do that and will not - I append certain information to F-PROT.EXE
after it is compressed, and I need to be able to change it later.  I am not
willing to open up what I consider a loophole, by allowing F-PROT to be run
uncompressed.

I'm not sure exactly which variant of Haifa VIRx is annoucning but Haifa
and it's variants are polymorphic file file infectors with a destructive
activation. (Polymorhpic means that Haifa hides from scanners by using
the variable encryption technique now made more famous in the MTE and
initially seen in Casper and the V2Px series). I'll describe the
original Haifa here in some detail. It is a resident infector of .COM
and .EXE files.  It will not infect overlay or .BIN or .SYS files. Haifa
appears to add between 2350 and 2400 bytes to each file.    Its first
action is to locate the command interpreter (eg. COMMAND.COM) via the
COMPSPEC= environment variable.  Haifa is memory resident but no change
to available memory will be visible using MEM or CHKDSK.  If a large
program is loaded, the PC will probably hang because the virus code is
overlaid. After infecting the command interpreter, Haifa will infect
files in the current directory and files in directories on the DOS path.
On Aug 24th or Apr 8th, the virus will display several lines of text
begining with:

  HAIFA VIRUS V1.12
  WRITEN BY ........

The PC will then hang.  The virus will overwrite the first 76 bytes of
any .ASM file with code to overwrite track zero of the first hard drive.
Any .PAS files with have the first 23 bytes overwritten by:

CONST VIRUS= "HAIFA";

.TXT or .DOC files will have the following text planted near their center:

 OOPS! Hope I didn't ruin anything!!!
 Well, nobody reads those stupied DOCS anyway!

(note the spelling of stupid;)

When executed, the virus seems to infect from two to four programs, but will
eventually infect all programs.

This virus has no stealth capabilities and can be picked out quickly by using
any directory listing program.  When Haifa infects a file, it will set the
minutes field of the time stamp to an even value (it clears the 0 bit) and it
will set the seconds field to 38.  Unusual numbers of progarms with seconds
set to 38 are a possible indication of this virus.

Whenever you attempt to access a disk drive DOS first checks the
status of the door open line. If the door has been opened since
the last disk access DOS then reads the FAT.  If this does not
match the last disk read (or if the read fails) DOS then reads
the disk boot sector.  If this fails DOS will reset the drive and
try again several times.

Thus, in the normal state of affairs, the boot sector of each
floppy is read just once.  This READ is usually preceded by an
attempt to read the FAT and this is preceded by a call to
Int 13 to check the door opened status.

I think this sequence is followed for DOS 3 on (but won't swear
to the door status call for DOS 3).

Subject: DOS6 Double Space and DOS Boot Sector Viruses (PC)

Other writers have reported that MBR infectors behave normally
under DOS 6, but it was not clear what effect Double Space would
have on viruses which infect the DOS Boot Sector on the hard
disk.

First we established

  1. Under Double Space the original drive C is normally
     accessible as drive H.

  2. Int 13 Sect 1, Head 1, Track zero will always return the
     true DOS boot sector.

  3. Int 25 sect 0, Drive H will return the true (standard DOS 5)
     boot sector.

  4. Int 25 sect 0, Drive C will return a dummy boot sector.
     This contains a copy of the size info, and is also standard
     DOS 5, but contains the text MSDSP6.0 in the OEM field, and
     DBLSPACE as the volume label.

For our tests we used AntiCad, which infects both files and DOS
boot sector.  We were only able to infect the hard disk DOS boot
sector by running a file on drive H, after running an infected
file (from floppy), so the virus was in memory.  If we checked
the boot sector on drive C, using Int 25, we got the standard
(clean) DOS dummy, but we were able to detect the virus in the
drive H boot sector.  We were able to recover and replace the
original boot sector in the normal way, after disabling the virus
in memory.

AntiCad infected executable files in the normal way, but the
system crashed quite often when we first ran an infected file.
We could not establish a pattern (though at one stage I thought
it was every 2nd boot!)  The crash probably occurred when the
virus attempted to infect the DOS BS, as it only occurred when
the first file was run.

Once the boot sector was infected the virus was activated
normally when the PC was rebooted.

In summary Double Space will signicantly reduce the risk of
multi-partite viruses infecting the hard disk DOS boot sector (as
relatively few files will be run from drive H), but may confuse
attempts to check the boot sector using Int 25.  (All this is
somewhat academic, as not many viruses infect the DOS boot
sector. Form is the only one I can think of that is at all
common.)

TBCLEAN from TBAV-package is able to clean TREMOR-infected files.
F-PROT 2.08 finds it.

I myself wrote a finder+cleaner : ANTISER.ZIP, frequestable. It desinfects
TREMOR-infected files just at the moment, they are started. No danger for re-
infection anymore. Does not work on packed files !

If you need more information : ask.

Subject: The Anti-Viral Software of MS-DOS 6 (PC)

I am not going to try to improve on Mr. Radai's masterful evaluation of
MSAV, rather I would like to point out that its shortcomings represent
an opportunity rather than a problem.

First, the lack of any boot sector checking in MSAV. I would like to
point out that my FREEWARE (if I can't get rich, I'll settle for glory 8*)
FixMBR with the SafeMBR code is entirely compatable with MS-DOS 6.0/MSAV.

True this does not protect 100% since the boot record is still exposed (I
bogged down on a "universal" boot record but SMBR type checking for DOS 4-5-6
boot records would be easy, possibly in FixUtil6 (once I get the bottom
six inches of stucco off my house, finish painting it, and get the a/c
working in the Judge).

As far as the easy disable in memory as documented widely, a tiny TSR
(uses no free RAM) could disable the disabler just as easily.

Finally, given that the signatures are distributed separately, what is to
stop an enterprising person from distributing their own signature update
for use with MSAV having a much higher detection rate (for a suitable fee
of course) ?

Thus the question must be not "whether MSAV is the One True Answer" but
"*could* it be ..." e.g. is the engine robust enough ? Certainly, Windows
is not without its share of problems but still is used by many as a "start".

Now let's look on the positive side: MSAV is at least trivially integrated
into DOS. I haven't tried it yet but would expect it to be compatable with
disk compression and Windows 32BitDiskAccess (possibly why the boot sector
component is disabled in VSAFE). One would have expected MS to have checked
it against necessary functions that we do not know about (yet 8*). In
other words, the hard part (nice human interface & it works) is done and the
a-v people can concentrate on improving the detection rate plus the low
level add-ons.

There are some drawbacks that I know of. For instance you can take a looong
coffee break while waiting for the memory scan on a 4.77 Mhz PC or XT but
this is fixable or possibly no-one will care.

Already I can see this happening. STAC (mfr of STACKER) has announced a
set of tools for DBLSPACE (which desperately needs help) & I expect they'll
make a bundle. To me MSAV represents the same opportunity & the only question
is: "Who will it be" ?

				Warmly,
					Padgett

ps STAC also quietly announced availability of STACKER for OS/2 on p 170
   of the May 24 PC-Week. Did anyone else notice ?

Macafee v104 scan does not recognize the DOS 6.0 vsafe (dos vshield).
When I unloaded it from the memroy, everything is fine.

I do not notice any behavior like that described above when I use McAfee's
Scan V102, S&S's FindViru 6.18, or UTScan 28.  I find it only when I run
F-PROT after running MSAV.  I then get the message "The xxxxxx virus search
pattern has been found in memory" (where xxxxxx is "Telecom", unless VSafe is
loaded in extended memory, in which case xxxxxx is "Stoned").  I therefore
think that the problem lies with F-PROT rather than with MSAV or VSafe in this
particular case.


  I would like to take this opportunity to mention an error and a few typos in
my article as published here on Tuesday:
  Section "MSAV", paragraph 2, lines 5-6: "main menu" should be "Options menu".
  Section heading "SECURTTY HOLES" should obviously be "SECURITY HOLES".
  Section "MSAV", paragraph 5, delete the right parenthesis at the end of the
paragraph (after "Anthrax").
  In the section "CONCLUSIONS AND CONJECTURES", entry "INTEGRITY CHECKING",
line 2, please delete the blank before the words "On files,".
