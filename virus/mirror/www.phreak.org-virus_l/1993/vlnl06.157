Wrong!
The real properties, mathematically speaking, are 'reproduction' of the
virus and 'modification' of the system.
Equating 'modifying' with 'causing damage' is  wrong, in specific scientific
terms, (We are not discussing the ethics behind here.)

These properties hardly equate to the properties of a lion!!!!
A lion is a predator by nature, a computer virus isn't.

I did not miss your point, I just pointed out that the analogy is
flawed from the ground up.
The comparison does not hold therefore your point is not valid.

How does this, make the manufacturers / inventors of guns etc. LIABLE
for the use of their products??
The illegality of it has nothing to do with LIABILITY.
So, let the owning, buying, etc. of weapons be illegal.. so what?
Are the MAKERS of the guns LIABLE?
NO!

Yes, sure.
But it cannot be proven that the deed of writing viruses causes such
things.
The ones that should be held liable are the ones that introduce viruses
in computer systems without authorization, (which is against the law
in many countries.)

In point 1 - I stand corrected: A few 'CARO-member' virus collections.

Agree.
But this is an specific case where the manufacturer is taking another
role not implied by the act of being just a manufacturer.
Sure you can find a million specific examples, but in general terms
if we refer to a manufacturer in the broad sense of the word the answer
is still :NO!

Have you ever heard of disclaimers?
That takes care of any implied secondary intentions you might want to
give to the manufacturer.
To complete my point: If the product has a proper disclaimer notice
the manufacturer cannot be held liable for the proper / improper use
of whatever the product is.
Computer viruses included.

Well, I predicted you reply, :)  and I stated below in the original
posting:

"While a million of you will argue that a good use for a computer virus is
 yet to be found, there is yet to be proven that there isn't a good use for

Agree, but a new generation of 'good' viruses will come along, such as Cruncher
and KOH (whether they work or not is another story), then you will not
be able to make such statement.

>Whether computer viruses are inherently destructive in theory is a
>different question and I will be glad to do some research in this

>about the viruses that exist *now* and that destroy data *now*.

What about the viruses that don't destroy data?
I will say that more than 60% (approximately) of all known viruses don't
carry any destructive or malicious code.

Are they destructive?
No! at least not in theory, unless you tag them as destructive by the mere
fact that they are 'viruses.'
If they cause damage accidentally, is besides the point, as there is plenty
of commercial software (Example: MS DOS's original Chkdsk.exe) that causes
unwanted destruction, so if you apply your thinking to commercial software
you could say that there is software that exists *now* that destroys your
data *now*.
Let's face it, software uncompatibilities and data destruction are not
exclusive to viruses.. on the contrary I have seen -some- viruses that have
less compatibility problems than a lot of commercial products, (AntiViral
ones included.)

Wrong! I am talking about the manufacturer, the 'maker' of the gun,
not third parties.
If a child misuses a gun, the parents may be liable, but the manufacturer
isn't; so the answer still is: NO.

This example is flawed, since the manufacturer will be liable for a defect
but NOT for the act of manufacturing a gun and its proper / improper
uses, (providing that it works properly :) )

Subject: Michael Lafaro

The 19NOV93 issue of Network World reports that a Michael Lafaro
has been arraigned under the New York state law against computer
tampering.  The charge was "intentionally infecting a customer's
network with a business-threatening virus".  Nassau County Police
say that one of Lafaro's employees was ordered to install the
"virus" in an account-tracking program of a furniture company in
Westbury NY.

This will be a test-case of sorts, in that Michael Lafaro is the
first person to be charged under this law.  The penalties could
be, if found guilty, up to 7 years prison and fines of $5-10k.

I'm curious if anyone knows whether this was a "real" virus, or
a "media/law-enforcement" virus.  Sounds like it was probably
just some form of trojan horse, but I am speculating now...

Hmmmmm.... well, my .02$ worth on this...

Sizewell B is Nuclear Electric's newest and most up to date reactor site, and
has cost an estimated 2 billion pounds to build. As yet, the site is yet to be
commissioned, and therefore the reactor has not been loaded with fuel.

The virus in question was the Yankee virus, which was discovered on the system
on 29th June of this year. However, the virus did not pose any danger to the
public (as implied in most of the stories printed on the incident). The reason
for the concern stemmed from the controversial new reactor protection systems
which are designed to shut the reactor down in case of an emergency.

The Sizewell site has several different computing systems. The main two
are an office network running OS/2 and the computers which are running the
reactor. These two systems are completely seperate, and it was the office
system which became infected.

The reactor computer system is not PC-based, and has all of its code blown
onto PROMs - it is, in effect, a Read-only system. Operators cannot add new
code to the system , nor can the run their own programs. Therefore, it was
never a target for virus infection. The whole event is such a non-story that
IMHO it did not deserve anything like the coverage it got. Sigh. Yet another
hype-driven piece of reporting.

I went down to Sizewell to do a followup piece for Virus Bulletin. Their
procedures are adequate for what is essentially an ordinary office system.
Even if the reactor control computer blew a fuse or whatever, it is multiply
backed up by hardware (ie switches, relays, transistors - not computers) so
that the safety of the plant does not rely on computers. Motto: don't fret.

It is a shame that the press coverage of computer viruses is so lousy. However,
that is another story. If people want to know more about the Sizewell thing,
fell free to Email me. If there is enough interest I can post the VB piece on
the plant.

Some software (not virus) can cause this sort of symptons. For example,

Subject: swiss variant (PC)

I don't know if this is the appropriate channel for my question, but i
could not find a better place.

The first syptoms noticed were on a friends computer (we work on the
same subjects at the univ. so we have shared files, and disks mostly
data files) the symptoms were that format did not work (reported
"invalid media 0" or some sort of error), and trying to list the
directory on drive a (3 1/2 floppy) would work for the first diskette
and once you switched the diskette it would display the directory of
the first diskette listed.  we ran norton disk docto and it reported
that the "switch disk" test failed.

similar symptoms appeared later on my own computer, format did not
work, and a similar switch disk problam ocured only on my computer
once the diskette was switched the new directory would list only the
free bytes on disk remained the same (the first disks free actual free
bytes).

we ran scan109 on both computers, on my friends computer it found
exebug [swb] and on my computer it found the swiss variant [swiss]. on
both computers clean109 would not clean.

the clean prog. said it recognized the virus (exebug[swb], swiss
variant [swiss ron each computer) and said it could not be removed
form the partition safely.

my question is how can i remove the viruses, are they the same and
just strains?could it be that clean102 sees the swiss virus as swb?
should i use fdisk with the /mbr option (what does this option do?)?

any help would be greatly appreciated.

Of all the anti-virus programs I have here, only three ever attempted
to disinfect this virus. Results:

FindVirus 6.51 (from Dr. Solomon's AVTK) - correctly disinfects both
COM and EXE files, except some garbage left at the end (up to 16
bytes), which cannot be removed. The program is commercial.

AntiVirus Pro - correctly disinfects COM files and damages EXE files.

TbClean (from TBAV) - correctly disinfects both COM and EXE files, but
is *very* inconvenient to use - can disinfect only one file each time
you start it.

My advice: if you can afford it, get Dr. Solomon's AVTK. If you can
afford only shareware programs, get TBAV and use some gind of GLOBAL
utility, which will run TbClean on all your infected files.

The person who made the original post OBVIOUSLY doesnt seem to know the
difference between heuristic scanning and a disinfection routine which
employs the emulated running of the virus in order to trick it into
supplying the original bytes of the infected program.

There was a probelem with TBCLean in this one instance, and the author
immeadiately remedied the problem.

: heuristic mode of TbScan does not cause any false alarm.

: Heuristic is already perfect. It detects about 90% of the new viruses.

: we, the authors of TBAV, even have seen the virus.

I must say that when used properly heuristics is an excellent workable
solution. I use it with the highest possible setting active. I do get an
occasional false positive, but when I do, I analyze the program that
triggered and ask myself does it have a reason to do these things that
caused it to activate?? If I dont think it does, I will load a hard disk
locker before running it.

You do not get that many false positives with TBSCAN because once you do
it the first time you VALIDATE all the false postives. Then TBSCAN knows
to only trigger if the file has been changed.

I would like to say that TB is the BEST anti-virus product available,
commercial or otherwise. And that is why so many of the other AV products
have adopted the innovative ideas created by Frans Veldman. I applaud his
fine product. My only gripe about is that I find too many "no entry in TB
lang." or whatever it is for the heuristic flag description.

rebooting, all was OK, but on checking disks or my own PC subsequently the

spreading as virulently as reported - Flip is a boot / partition sector virus

Dos 6 VSafe, & this appears to be the problem, producing a spurious message by

drives don't detect a disk change.  When I do a mem /P I get a "blem wit"
as one of the loaded programs.

I had a virus that acted simalar a year ago called the michoangelo or
something like that which I exterminated.  but this one seems to evade
scanning programs.

Anyone have any help?

Subject: Clicking sound from PC speaker but can't find virus?? (PC)

    I work under Windows 3.1 almost exclusively, and have vshield installed
at boot-time and when in Windows.  Recently I have had intermittent
clicking/ringing from my PC speaker.  The sounds only occur when I
delete or move files in the FileManager or some other program
that allows file deletetion or moving.

   I noticed the sound for the first time around the begining/middle of
November (can't remember the exact date).  It only occurred once or twice
on the day I used it, and scanning for viruses using scan V108B indicated
all was clean.

   I thought it might be the FORM virus or a variant thereof, because I
had been infected with FORM a few weeks earlier (safely removed, and
everything scanned as clean).  However, the clicking noise was not
in any way associated with the keyboard, the date was off (definitely
NOT the 18th), and I haven't heard of FORM producing a ringing noise
from the PC speaker (sounds like a cheesey electronic phone).

   The sounds reocurred several times on December 2nd, but not since.
I have vshield V109 installed, but it never reported anything.  Scanning for
viruses using scan V109 also turns up nothing.

   There have been no apparent changes in memory (with mem /c), and when
the noises occurred, I was using only programs that I have had on my
system for several months.

   Any help is appreciated,

Tim

F-Prot recently found Power Pump in XYPHR2.COM on the CD Deathstar Arcade
Battles by Chestnut Software.  At the time, I suspected that it was a false
alarm, and I was going to check it more carefully before filing a report.  I
scanned the CD after the game Aquanoid, run under OS/2, displayed a message
saying it was going to format the hard disk and then hung.  I was going to
give this CD to my son, but maybe it should become a frisbee instead.

Hi,
is there anybody here something about the "Perry-Virus"?
It was found on diffrent PC in our uni and only verify with tnt-scanner.

The effect -losing many files and perhaps destroyed FAT.

I am happy it was not on my PC.

Thanks Elmar

Subject: A New Virus? (PC)

Of late three of the PC's (386's and 486's) in my lab have been behaving
oddly...

The problem is thus: The screen blanks out, the keyboard and the mouse both
freeze. The only way is to reboot the computer. This means that the application
one may be working on dies, and data, unless saved regularly, is lost.

The same thing happens even if no applications were being run. Though I may
have had TSR's as Norton Commander or Windows open.

I ran the latest F-PROT and SCAN, the results were negative.

Any similar experiences?

Reaper...Hmm..One of the viruses produced by the British ARCV group was
named Reaper. This virus is 1072 bytes long, and attaches itself to the end of
COM and .EXE files.  I don't remmeber when I added detection/disinfection of
this virus to F-PROT, but it has been around for a while.

If you have a real problem with this virus, (instead of being just curious
about it), you should really contact the computer crime unit of the police, as
all the ARCV members were caught, but there is a certain lack of complaints
against them :-)

What you probably have is a partially disinfected disk, that was infected
once, and then partially owerwritten with "clean" code.

                           Getting Help

This is *very* difficult.  Who do you turn to?  Who do you trust?
Who can help?

Do not automatically trust your local repair shop.  Computer retail,
rental and repair outfits have become significant vectors for viral
spread.  They may very well have superlative skills in diagnosis and
repair, but being able to put a computer together, or take it apart
and find out why it isn't working, is not the same as study and
research in the virus field.  The number of experienced and
knowledgeable virus researchers in the entire world is probably less
than one hundred:  the number of "instant experts" on the basis of
possession of an out-of-date scanning program is in the hundreds of
thousands.

The preceding may be seen as a slap at computer repair people.  It
is in no way intended to be so.  The point that I am trying to make
is that knowledge about viral programs is extremely specialized.
Computer repair is highly skilled and specialized itself--but not in
the virus area.  Nor is this to say that help desk personnel,
computer consultants, systems integrators or even data security
specialists, have any advantage in dealing with viral programs,
unless they have made specific study in the field.

Enough with the bad news.  Where *can* you find help?

The only place to get accurate and timely information, for most
people, is from the virus discussion groups on computer networks.  I
am referring to the international networks; the Internet and
Fidonet; rather than commercial systems, no matter how large.
Compuserve has at least three "virus" related forums:  all are
merely technical support venues for specific commercial products.
Of the various "virus" discussions on commercial systems I am only
aware of two with any substance.  Therefore, whoever you call on for
help should have access to, and read regularly, VIRUS-L on the
Internet, comp.virus on Usenet and either VIRUS, VIRUS_INFO or
WARNINGS on Fidonet, or VirNet which uses Fidonet technology.

It is, of course, very easy to *say* that you keep up with the
latest research and not quite as easy to test the statement.  Here
is a quick check.  At the risk of sounding like I have an ego the
size of Manhattan:  if they don't know me, it is highly unlikely
that they know the field.

No, I am not just a conceited windbag trying to blow my own horn.  I
could easily name a dozen people who are more expert than I (and
would immediately get into trouble by *not* naming a dozen more,
equally qualified, whose names momentarily escaped me).  The point
is that I post articles on a weekly basis (or better) to pretty well
anywhere of any significance.  On second thought, maybe the fact
that I am *not* one of the big names is an advantage.  If they know
me, they really do read *all* of the information.
