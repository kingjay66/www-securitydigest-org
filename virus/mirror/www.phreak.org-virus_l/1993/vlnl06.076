I have never heard of any problems or conflicts with using a TSR virus
detenction program... McAffee's Virus Shield supposedly works quite
well, and loads into upper memory. I've never heard of any problems
with using it on a LAN.

You could simply use the interrupt controller to mask the IRQ of the
disk drive.  But yes, the disk can be operated in purely a polling
mode.  The unit atn interrupts are an option.  I think a lot of people
don't understand how disk controllers in the PC environment work at a
port level.  The original interface was the WD1003, which is what
virtually all MFM, RLL, ESDI and IDE (ATA) disk drives respond to.
There are two 8 bit regs you load up with the cylinder, one for the
head, one for the sector, and one for the count.  Then by writing
an opcode into the control register, the operation begins.  I've
posted at length on this issue on Fido Virus_Info, should I cross-
post it here?

Just to be difficult.
I dont believe it is illegal to write a virus. Just to spread it around
deliberately. Now If I had written a virus for experimental (mental)
purposes and had it on some disks on my desk.
Then if someone stole my disks and and computer (a housebreaking.)
Then could I claim copyright on any signitures that scanners used
to recognise my inadvertantly released virus. ;-}

I actually think I couldnt. Sue for copyright.

Because any signature used by the virus writers. did not utilise my
                                            execute      ^^^^^^^
code sequence and the algorithm it represents. The sequence
is short and hence not subject to copyright in the same way that
a previous post suggested that you cant copyright "A Sheep"

Nothing wrong with this. If you can get a Flash-RAM board set up to be
bootable, and install your a-v software there too, then you need not
worry about anybody subverting a clean boot [unless they open up the
PC], nor need you worry about your a-v modules getting infected. That
would be ideal: a PC that basically boots from firmware and does nothing
but offer to scan discs.

The problem here is that you'd be breaking a basic rule of virus clean-up:
Boot From a Clean DOS Floppy. Whilst some (indeed many) viruses can be
cleaned up without a clean boot, others may delude you into believing they're
gone when they're not. IMO, whilst you might want to handle the reporting
of infected workstations automatically, you should arrange for your tech
support gurus (aka Emergency Response Team) to handle clean-ups manually.

A TSR virus scanner would be great. "On demand" scanners can help tremendously.
For instance, if delegates stick in floppies and try to run infected
programs, they won't just be alterted to the virus -- the virus will be
prevented from actuating. LAN coexistence won't be a problem.

I also suggest that if the PCs you're using as workstations permit their
boot sequence to be altered to inhibit floppy boot-up that you utilise
this "feature" to help suppress boot sector viruses. This won't stop someone
who wants to infect a PC from doing so maliciously, but it will help
stop accidents.

Lastly, I'd suggest that you don't use any "active monitor" a-v software.
Active monitors are resident utilities (also known as "behaviour blockers")
which watch for apparently virus-like behavious and attempt to prevent it.
I think you'll find that the false alarms will probably waste your tech
support people's time -- and possibly focus attention on viruses, to the
exclusion of other PC issues.

I had this happen with scanv102 and v99.  The first time scan was run
after a cold boot, no viruses were reported.  Thereafter, running scan
results in a Filler report in memory.  I also spotted Iboot a
couple of times (also as a memory virus).
A complete scan of my hard drive (6188 files) with /A reported no
viruses.
This was causing considerable consternation until I checked the
Internet and found these reports.  I hope the assumptions
of false positives are correct.

Has anyone else installed the latest version of McAfee NetShield (104---150)
on their Novell File Servers and noticed a problem with the "On-Access"
scanning options.  I configured it with "in-coming only" on-access scanning,
yet the display indicated all files were being scanned (out-going as well).
Has anyone else noticed this???  Is it a bug with the NLM???

It also appear to eat up much more utilization than the previous versions of
NetShield.

I am having a problem getting McAfee netscan to scan a complete network disk.
I am using V102 of scan and Wollongong NFS to access the net drive.  The
disks I need to scan are 1.2GB and 660MB and it just stops at random places
every time I try.  Does netscan handle drives this large?  Is my nfs causing
the problem?  Is there another way I can scan these drives?

Any help would be appreciated since we just found Scream2 [696] and I would
like to make sure it's not on the net drives.

That's why this protection is not very effective. Image a virus implementing
the following pseudo-code idea:

copy to-infect.com temp.moc
infect temp.moc
del to-infect.com
copy temp.moc to-infect.com
del temp.moc

and your 'protected' executable is straight infected. Such a virus is not
likely to be very effective, the only thing I want to show is that some on-the-
first-look-bullet-proof methods can be circumvented. You also could 'use'
companion-type infectors, or... :-|

Uh... a very dangerous statement. In fact it's wrong. See why:

The problem is, most viruses don't care if they infect COMMAND.COM internally
or externally. They will go resident anyway after the next boot.
BTW, if you define "infecting" by "virally change the runtime behaviour of an
executable", the executable is infected too, just at another level. For
example, you can infect an executable directly by attaching code to or putting
into it, and indirectly via exploiting OS capabilities (e.g. companion attack)
or its directory file handle (filesystem infection, e.g. DIR-II alias MG
Series II alias Creeping Death). Viruses using these infection techniques don'
t care about compressing.

Hello All,

I've recently received two comments about my posting in comp.virus
about the ARCV viruses and would like to clear a couple of points
up:

1.      The viruses were *ALLEDGEDLY* written by ARCV.  There
        has been no legal determination that ARCV wrote any of

2.      All viruses were for MS-DOS (no Mac, Unix, etcetera).

Subject: Re: Port Writes (PC)

Yes, it is difficult to stop viruses that use direct port writes. There are
things an a-v program can do to spot direct-writes from an unintelligent
virus writer, but you can't count on them.  Something like OS/2 can spot
them, unless the virus gets control first.  Hardware alarms would probably
be the safest and cheapest long-term solution.

Of course viruses with direct writes have to be that much bigger, but that
isn't enough to make them obvious now, except in the case of one designed
to take control at boot time yet let OS/2 run. The fact that code contains
port I-O instructions is the best clue, but it would take the next generation
of a-v software to spot it (unless the virus writer didn't bother to encrypt
it). I could say more, but there might be a virus writer watching! :-)

Logically yes (e.g. old DISK-KILLER marks three blocks as bad in the FAT),
physically NO.

It happens more often that a HD gets more bad sectors in it's life, and that
doesn't say that your problem is because of a virus infection. Your problem
sounds similar to the problem I had with a Kalok HD. There was no virus on it,
but after I while I had to format the HD, because of the growth of bad-sectors.
After the low-level format I still had the same problems.

Is it possible that you can get bad sectors because of a virus ?

The question was realy supposed to be "what happeneds at the end when the disk
is accessed?" how does the BIOS int-13 access the disk (how does the machine
do it in hardware ?).

So if you are doing a "natural" int-21 file access request, mabe it starts a
long process envolving the board's port- addressing chip? (SCSI is an
exeptional here).

And Windows, and some Disk-Doublers, and Disk-Manager, and some programs that
swap with the disk, and Anti-Viruses, and ... Well isn't that enogh? What does
your common user uses, only a word processor? ;-)

The DMA's definition is: Access any combination of I/O and memory !!! So not
so surprizingly *ALSO* the disk. Although I agree the disk is (on "normal"
operation conditions) an exeptional device and the DMA is usually not assigned
to treat it.

A. Just my point. This method is not usefull against many    viruses.
B. The viruses you've mentioned and the method of replacing Read with Write
are not new, there are other old viruses that do that.

Thanks for the appreciation.

If you know Central-Point's Option Board (do you?) you'l know what I mean. It
is connected in another slot and chains to the flat cable going from the disk (
floppy) controller to the drive. In many cases the floppy will have lots of
write problems, Try it on several computers you will see.

My opinion is that the viral protection system should be:
With minimal overhead, Minimal interference with system operation,
Minimal reductionin computer performance, Minimal memory consumption,
Minimal changes to the files and system and a lot more... In other words: The
computer is a user's working tool, not an Anti-Virus machine. And what you are
suggesting has gone far beyond that, it may be good for a virus researcher.

[ excellent installation manual deleted ... ]
I say it out of experiance with lots of commercial products that do that,
Some users had to reinstall the disk due to Hardware Anti-Virus products.

   I have a question, can a virus infect NOVELL system?  Since there are
many read-only files in NOVELL, how can it write into that file?  If it can't
, how can it live when the power turned off?
   But I really heard some viruses can infect NOVELL.  Can anyone answer me?

                        Types of Antivirals

The foregoing is not to say that a standard for the judging of
antiviral software cannot be achieved.  It is, however, an extremely
difficult task and one which we may not be able to complete at this
time.  One of the consistent barriers to judging software is that
antiviral software comes in many types.  I would now like to
elucidate *my* list of what those types are.

(I am fully aware that there is going to be debate about the number
of types of antiviral software.  The numbers are not all that
important.  As we proceed in more depth through the various
categories of antiviral systems, you will note that almost endless
permutations can be made by a combination of the various features.
Hopefully the following will simply allow you to build your own
categories and to judge the software that might be best for your
situation.)

The first commercial antiviral systems to appear, interestingly
enough, relied upon encryption.  This was likely a hold-over from
the fact that most "serious" security types come from a mainframe or
communications environment.  Encryption is, of course, a good way to
ensure that people cannot gain unauthorized access to your
information.  While it does have some potential for protection of
existing software, few systems primarily targeted at viral
infections now use encryption at all.

Those early encryption systems were often paired with operation
restricting software.  Restrictive software has continued to be a
reasonably popular means of defence, probably because it *does*
defend systems and prevent the infection of programs and disks.

Closely related to operation restricting software is activity
monitoring software.  This software, as the name implies, oversees
the operation of the computer and alerts the user when suspicious
activity takes place.  I differentiate it from operation restricting
software because control is left in the hands of the user.
(Interestingly, a number of these programs are named "Vaccines",
even though their method of operation has nothing in common with a
biological vaccine.)

Change detection software, also known as integrity checking
software, determines whether the program, file, or system has
changed, as compared against a previously established data base.  If
a sufficiently broad overview of the system is taken, this will
provide 100% effective detection of a viral infection, but it also
may raise a number of false alarms.

Scanners, particularly signature scanners, are currently the most
popular of antiviral software.  This is likely due to three factors,
the fact that viral programs are specifically identified, the
inclusion of disinfecting software with most scanners, and the fact
that it's easy to play numbers games with signature scanning
programs.

PRTAVS5.CVP   930425

               Evaluation Standards - Numbers again

We have tried to show some of the difficulties in choosing antiviral
software.  There are, of course, matters of the type, the test suite
against which the computer is effective, the user interface and the
"style" of the program or system.  Still, surely there must be
*some* standard by which to measure antiviral software?

In the computer world, the nice thing about standards is that there
are so many to choose from.

However you divide the different types of software, it is extremely
difficult to apply the same standards to various categories.
Besides the problems of the "numbers game", in testing a given
program against a given suite of viral programs, the importance of
the test results are of different importance to a scanner, a change
detector, and an operation restrictor.  For operation restricting
software, it may be of no importance whatsoever that the program
does not "catch" infections; so long as the restricting software is
100% effective in preventing the spread of infection, it does not
matter whether it ever "identifies" any viri.  Change detection
software may "catch" all infections, and yet be less effective than
a scanner which catches only 90%, but effectively identifies them as
well.  (Unfortunately, one must also factor in the fact that change
detectors will generate a *lot* of "false positives", particularly
as software vendors continue to insist on writing programs which
modify themselves.)  Therefore, a single "numeric" standard, based
upon the use of a test suite, would be of little utility in
assessing the overall effectiveness of antiviral software.

In addition, the environment is constantly changing.  Not simply the
corporate or user environment, but the number, specific strains and
types of viral programs are increasing all the time.  One of the
newer types of viral programs, as of this writing, is the companion,
spawning or "precedence" virus, which, in order to prevent the
detection of a changed program, does not change the files on disk at
all, but rather takes advantage of the order in which programs are
"called for".  Thus those operation restricting programs which
prevent changes to program files become useless, as do change
detectors which peruse only those files in the database at the
previous "run".  Standards, therefore, which are based upon the
currently existing viral environment, will be very quickly outdated,
and mostly useless.

A single, or even multiple, numeric measure simply does not have
sufficient flexibility to gauge antiviral software.  It may be
possible to construct one, after considerable work.  However, even
if a criterion reference could be made broad enough to cover the
various types of antiviral software, the gauge would have to be a
moving one.  Thus, antiviral software tested at one point, would
have to be retested each time the standard was renewed: at a
minimum, that would likely be on a yearly basis.
