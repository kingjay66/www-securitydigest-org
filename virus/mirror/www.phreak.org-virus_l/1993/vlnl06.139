I don't see why it would be illegal to give a virus researcher a
virus, especially after you tell him.  Furthermore, as stupid as it
may seem, you could (should!) encrypt the virus/trojan.  Then, the
virus researcher would decrypt it.  There are many ways to decrypt
things, who says there is no alg to convert the message you just
posted into a virus?  As stupid as it may be, it is possible.

Okay, DOS and it's utilities are probably the biggest virus - I see it

Once again, A virus does stuff, and it doesn't tell you what is going
on (usually).  They don't just stop and say, "Oh, I am going to infect
this file, is this okay?"

Sure, now complain about all of the other utilities that you have.  THey're
all made for that purpose.  Probably when you acquired them, you knew what
they were going to do.  They didn't just go and delete any 'ol file, randomly

By using the phrase "destined for". FORMAT.COM -can- be used for
unauthorized data modification and so can be used Norton Utilties, but
this not what they are destined for. Besides, both programs warn you
when they are about to modify something in a nagerous way. As opposed
to it, the primary (and only, IMHO) purpose of the e.g. Michelangelo
virus is data destruction.

This said, I tend to agree with the others who replied to the original
message, that the law proposal doesn't seem to be thought well enough
and it tends to apply draconian measures in a hope to solve the
problem.

Heh. According to some law proposals here, it might become even
illegal to disassemble a program without the explicit permission of
its author, except for some very limited purposes (analysis for
maliciousness doesn't seem to be included in them)... :-( We might
have to go underground with our whole VTC, if such a law is passed...
:-)

Oh, in many countries they can imprison the person who has sold him
the gun...

The main difference is intent, IMHO.

You've got to be joking!  I enquired some time ago if anyone was able
to initiate a class action (my estimate was that the conference
represented a loss of about $500,000, and the Proceedings alone
represent an unmet legal responsibility for about $50,000), & the same
question was asked at the (very successful) Virus Bulletin Conference
in Amsterdam, but no one answered.

Subject: Two gems from the CPAV 2.0 manual (PC)

Hello, everybody!

Here are two gems that can be found in the manual for CPAV:

page 106, the second paragraph:

"If VWatch or VSafe is in memory and you run another manufacturer's
anti-virus application, you may receive an alert that a virus is
present when the other application checks memory for viruses. In
reality, the application sees the signature for a virus, not the
actual virus. Turn off any other anti-virus application and use
Central Point Anti-Virus to avoid receiving these false alarms."

page 156, the third paragraph:

"Virus Notification: You run another manufacturer's anti-virus program
and receive a virus alert from VSafe or VWatch that a virus is
present.

"Cause: With VSafe or VWatch installed, Central Point Anti-Virus sees
the signature for a virus, not the actual virus.

"Solution: Disable any other anti-virus application, and use the
Central Point Anti-Virus application to avoid receiving these false
alarms."

Note that they are using the same logic to reach two contradictury
conclusions:

I. Some other program falsely report a virus when our program is
present, so just use our program.

II. Our program falsely reports a virus when some other programs are
present, so just use our program.

Or, in general:

Problem: Our program causes problems to the other anti-virus programs.
Solution: Stop using other anti-virus programs and use ours.

As far as I know, the CPAV folks are the only anti-virus company that
is so arrogant. When I met several of them (including Eli Shapira, the
main developer) during a technical meeting in Munich a few weeks ago,
I spent several hours, explaining them why their program is bad, no,
it's useless, no, it's dangerous; what's wrong with it; and how to fix
it. Their reply essentially was: "Our program is used by 60 millions
of users. If there were something wrong with it, they wouldn't be
using it." Obviously, they seem to think that (a) every damn PC on
this planet is running their useless software and (b) that 60 millions
of lemmings can't be wrong.

t is unlikely this will occur for every virus they can "find".  I don't
this is a very common practice.  Nowadays, it is easier to code up a "new"
virus, or at least have soem stupid prorgam like VCL or MPC make one.
This code most likely would then be modified.

It would only be "a lot of work" if the >STRINGS< are encrypted.  For
some products, this is trivial (i.e. Central Point - even while in
memory, it's trivial to find them).

If the >STRINGS< are encrypted, then it would take abit of time to figure
out what is going on, and might require tracing through a good few hundred
K sized file to find out where they are decrypted, and how so.

Finally, if there are no strings used to detect a virus, but maybe a
sequence of "commands" to the scanner, somewhat like a script, then it
would be extremely difficult to get just one.

Sorry, I must take my recommendation back. It was brought to my
attention that version 3.0 of NAV does NOT run on anything below a
80286. So, if the job of the original poster is to maintain anti-virus
protection in a large cluster of PCs, which also include XTs - forget
about NAV 3.0 and get something that works.

Subject: Yoshi Virus *&^%$ Help! (PC)

I work at a student computer lab at the University of Delaware.  We
came across a hard-drive that was infected with the Yoshi virus. We
tried everything we knewof to remove it:

  DOS FORMAT (4 Times)
  CHANGING the PARTITION MAP
  NORTON WIPEDISK
  WRITING 0's to entire disk & Reformatting

None of these methods have worked. After reinstalling DOS on this
machine with a LOCKED DISK, the virus has reappeared each time.  Our
network is not infected.  We are vigilant about checking disks, but
when a user doesn't give usall of their disk for checking, things like
this happen. Does anyone know how toremove YOSHI?

I would appreciate any advise you Netters can provide. Thanks;)

I -know- that it sounds like the Cascade virus. However, it sounds
like a few other viruses too (off the top of my head I recall
Falling_Letters_Boot), and since Cascade is fairly old and well-known
I would have expected any reasonably good scanner to detect and report
it. Unless, of course, it's a new variant, or a joke program, or a
faulty video, or whatever. That's why the original poster should (a)
run a recent scanner to find whether it is a known virus and (b) if
that fails, try to determine whether it is a virus at all (i.e.,
whether it replicates) and to send a sample to somebody more qualified
for analysis.

> which I believe is listed as

I wouldn't believe -anything- written in VSUM without verifying it
myself. It's literally full of mistakes. No, worse, you have to search
real hard, in order to find an article which is entirely correct.

In this particular case, we keep getting reports for Cascade from the
wild, so the virus doesn't seem aware of what Patti Hoffman says about
it...

> be able to clean it because cascade is rather old.

Yes, that's why I supposed that it might be something else. Besides,
the chances for Cascade (I mean, the standard version) to activate on
a modern machine are pretty slim - only if somebody sets the clock's
date to 1980 before running an infected program, or to one of the last
months of 1988.

Yeah, that's an old idea... It's not the first virus that's
implementing it; I seem to remember a (Czech? Hungarian? Polish?
Russian?) virus, which checks if something is appended to the infected
file after the virus body and prints a warning message if such
additional code it discovered.

Slight correction: First, Cruncher uses the compression algorithm of
Diet, not of LZEXE, and second, it has "stollen" only the algorithm
and the decompressor; it doesn't use the utility itself.

Filler?! That's pretty strange; I don't think that this obscure

Not at all. Just Filler is a boot sector infector, so it is useless to
look for it in the files.

Hm. What do you mean by "a machine that has tested positive"? That the
virus has been found on its hard disk? Or only in memory?

Nah, I'm not aware of any such mutation of Filler...

Aha, the picture is getting more clear. SCAN says that this virus is
only in memory, doesn't it?

Everything is clear now. You almost certainly don't have a virus. Do
the following:

1) Remove the line from your AUTOEXEC.BAT or CONFIG.SYS that starts
the program VSAFE.

2) Remove the whole package CPAV/MSAV/TNTVIRUS or whatever instance of
this product you are using.

3) Throw the package mentioned above in the trash bin and spit on it.

And your problem will go away. Just in case somebody sneaks in and
manages to reinstall the package, get F-Prot version 2.09f - it will
warn you if the resident part of the package (which is causing your
problems) is active.

Optionally, read the part of the FAQ that explains what a "ghost
positive" is and why this happens.

I am really tired to explain that the developers of CPAV/MSAV/TNTVIRUS
are stupid enough to keep the scan strings they are using unencrypted
in memory. On the top of that, the guys from the local Microsoft
hotline here, who don't seem to know -anything- about viruses, have
found it very clever to give the telephone number of our VTC to every
poor soul who calls them and asks them why running scanner XYZ after
installing MS-DOS 6.0 and its MSAV reports different viruses in
memory... :-(((

No. No pure boot sector virus can do that. The only natural way to get
infected with a boot sector virus is to attempt to boot from a medium
infected with it.

Some "unnatural" ways include starting a Dropper which installs a boot
sector virus on the hard disk, or an Injector, which leaves it active
in memory, or executing a file infected with a multi-partite virus
(one which infects both files and boot sectors). However,
Stoned.Empire.Monkey is not a multi-partite virus.

Chinese_Fish is not intentionally destructive. Any anti-virus program
which can remove it, should leave your hard disk in its uninfected
state.

Should. In any case, this virus stores the original MBR at cylinder 0,
head 0, sector 10. If something goes wrong, you could try to restore
it "manually" from there, using some kind of disk sector editor.
However, this shouldn't be attempted, unless you know perfectly well
what you are doing. If you have any doubts, call somebody more
experienced, e.g. the tech support person.

The virus is described in our Computer Virus Catalog. Read the FAQ for
information how to obtain the latter.

No, it means that the Chinese_Fish virus will "kill" the Stoned virus
(well, one of its variants - Michelangelo, I believe).

> How does FISH wreck your disk?

*Chinese* Fish, please - because there is also Fish_6 and a few other
viruses with "fishy" names - Cod, Haddock, Whale, etc.

Anyway, as I said, the virus is not intentionally destructive, so it
shouldn't wreck your disk.

> Is it triggered by date or what... it

Yes. It displays its message on every disk access on the 1st, 11th,
21st, and 31st of every month in 1992, if the BIOS of the infected
machine supports INT 1Ah (most ATs and above do).

Subject: Removing Boot Sector Virus from Floppies (PC)

We had an epidemic of the ESSEX virus (supposedly started here in
ESSEX, VT), known to FPROT as the QRry virus.  I can see where the
name comes from -- when I use a hex editor on the boot sextory QRry is
there...

We cleaned it up fairly easily (after reading the FAQs here and asking
around) with FDISK /MBR, and restoring with SYS.  This was easy --
we're all DOS 5 in the lab where the infection happened.  I hate to
think of the hassles if it gets around campus where we have a lot of
different varieties of DOS!

Here is the problem, and I'd appreciate any help from the nets.  I
don't see how to clean off floppy disks since the boot sector remains.
Copying a file or just doing a DIR of the disk seems to put the virus
code into RAM (F-PROT finds it , McAfeee doesn't...), but not
propagate it.  I'm concerned about two things: Accidental inserting of
infected disks before bootup (this will infect it), and students
propagating virii that they got HERE at other sites (like home, work
etc.).  I'd like to have a better way to tell students how to clean up
disks than "copy all files to the hard drive, reboot to remove Qrry
from memory, format the disk, copy them back."  I'm not entirely sure
that this clean it up, either.  Damn these virus-writing sociopaths.
This has wasted too much of my time already.

And by the way, is there any way this virus could be lurking in some
part of our Novell server?  I don't think a Novell volume has anything
like a boot sector (there is a boot IMAGE for no-disk booting, and I
suppose I need to restore that from a known clean copy just in
case...).

Subject: AVP 1.07 available (PC)

Hello, everybody!

I received from the Russian anti-virus researcher Eugene Kaspersky the
new version of his excellent shareware anti-virus program AVP. The new
version is 1.07.

Becauses of some communication problems, he sent me only the minimal
subset of the package, which can be used only for virus scanning and
disinfection. There is no help file, no virus information database
editor, no external utilities. Since all those were present in the
previous version of the package (1.06), I kept both versions on our
ftp site. As soon as I get the rest of the package, I'll update
version 1.07 and will remove version 1.06.

The full reference of the new archive is

ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de:/pub/virus/progs/avp107_m.zip

('m' stands for "minimal".)

Just a reminder for those who are not aquainted with the package - it
is an integrated system, with excellent scanner/disinfector, excellent
on-line virus information database (with live demonstrations of the
effects of many viruses), excellent memory browser (the best I've
seen), a good monitoring program, and a modest integrity checker.
Version 1.06 had problems to run under DesqView; this is fixed in the
new one.

                     CONFERENCE ANNOUNCEMENT

                             VSI '94

                Philadelphia, Pennsylvania - USA

                        March 29-30, 1994

            Presented by the Virus Security Institute

      "A Different Kind of Information Security Conference"

    ________________________________________________________

     VSI '94  -- two intense days of interactive collaboration
focused on the development of a working information security model
appropriate to both the management and technical challenges of the
mid-90s.

     Security is not a book of rules; it is an organic and dynamic
process.  This principle will be expanded through an agressive
combination of speakers, scenarios and solutions.

     VSI '94 is not a hit-or-miss conference.  The program is
carefully structured to provide not only state-of-the-art
information but practical techniques that "push the envelope".

     DAY ONE:  In the morning, industry experts will present a
limited number of papers dealing with state-of-the-art considerations
divided into three areas: scientific, technical, and managerial. This
will provide a primer for what is to follow.

In the afternoon, articipants will restructure a traditional
organization to reflect the information security needs of the mid-
90s.  The Management Track will address requirements for
executives, financial and legal considerations, operating
parameters, policies and procedures, re-engineering, communications
requirements and a five-year plan.  The Technical Track will
explore tools and techniques currently available, define
requirements and techniques to preserve vital information that may
come under attack from any quarter, automation of support
functions, necessary networking and risk assessment.

Industry experts in each field will be present to make suggestions
and offer examples. The afternoon will be divided into segments
for each of the tracks with a focus provided for each. If the
participants fail to reach a concensus within the segment's alotted
time, the legacy baseline will be used on the next day.

Further planning is encouraged in the bar and at the reception.

     DAY TWO:  Each of the elements of the restructured model will
be examined and challenged, both by speakers and participants.
Management will be given legal, financial, and stockholder concerns
to address.  Technical will defend against attack scenarios
ranging from viruses to terrorists to incendiary cows & leaking tunnels.

     PLENARY:  A recap of the proceedings analyzing strengths and
weaknesses of the model as developed, challenged, and improved.

     PAPERS:  We solicit papers/speakers focusing on the subjects of
fiendish attacks, brilliant solutions, organizational indifference,
and prognostication. The focus will be on salvation from the Networks
(both interpretations apply).

     SITE:  The entire conference floor of the Philadelphia Airport
Hilton has been reserved for VSI '94.  Rooms for Birds-of-a-Feather
meetings may be reserved in advance, subject to availability.
Facilities will be available for larger, lengthy formal meetings on
Monday, March 28.  The hotel is designed to facilitate "H" (hall)
track sessions.
          Room Rates:  $72/night, single or double.  Contact the
Hilton (302)792-2700
     The Hilton provides a complimentary continental breakfast to
all hotel guests.

     TRAVEL:  Philadelphia International Airport (transportation
from airport provided by the Hilton) is served by most major
airlines.  Drive time from either Washington, DC or New York is
approximately 2 hours.  AMTRAK serves Philadelphia's 30th Street
Station (local train available every half hour to airport for
Hilton pickup).   Discounted airfares are available from Sand Lake
Travel (800)535-1116 / (407)352-2808 / FAX (407)352-2908

     AMENITIES & AMUSEMENTS:  Philadelphia is rich in attractions,
from the Liberty Bell to the Franklin Institute to the Art Museum
to the bustling 9th Street Market.  Excellent shopping in both
Philadelphia and tax-free Delaware.  Nearby is the famous
Brandywine Valley, home of Winterthur, Longwood Gardens and Andrew
Wyeth.  A full activities packet will be available to all
registrants.
