Well, I am off for the Virus Bulletin conference in Amsterdam, followed by
my annual vacation, far away from any viruses.

My staff here in Iceland will know how to get in touch with me if absolutely
necessary, but don't expect any E-mail replies from me personally until I get
back on the 22nd.

i dont know where this information came from, bill, but according to
everything i have read, uraguay came from Uraguay. dark avenger is/was
from bulgaria :). that virus has been around since december 1992, and
in my extended conversations with dav, it was -never- mentioned as one
of his viruses.

there are a lot of people who would like him to be writing and
distributing viruses. monster virus writers make much better press
than ones that quit or suspended 'operations' for whatever reason. i
study the subculture relating to virus writers, and if someone has
some documentable verifiable proof that this particular guy is at it
again, i would really appreciate seeing it.  it woudl be an important
part of the work involved in developing case histories and a general
overview of the 'culture' that exists around viruses.

however, to date, all i have seen regarding this particular guy is a
few imitators, some insertions of his name in test strings, and a few
attempts to provoke him to some action or other made by persons who
are part of the virus subculture. i know this is not your intent;
maybe someone told you he wrote that virus. as far as i know, he's
never been in uraguay, and more importantly, did not write that virus.
at least, he has not stated he did, and he has been more than
cooperative about his past actions.

Priority: normal

Hello all,

I have just finished carrying out experiments designed to test the
detection ability of three products namely :

   i. Dr Solomons Toolkit
  ii. McAffee Scan v106
 iii. F-prot v2.08d

They were specifically chosen as available on internet in case of
McAffee whilst Dr Solomons has been aggressively marketed in South
Africa.  I did not bother using the local product from CSIR which in
my view was a very limited product when compared to the three
mentioned above.

Samples of used were restricted to multi-partite viruses which
included DAVs as well as stealth. The viruses were firstly
disassembled to the target assembler TASM v2.0. The disassembled
sources were then modified in the following manner :

  Non-Encrypting Viruses
  ----------------------
  Modification : The potential string combination were slightly
altered
                 ie. Reset virus's omega sign display. This was done
without
                 any slightest idea as to what the detection string
might
                 be to pervent any biasing.
                 Some codes pieces were removed (a couple of bytes
only).

  Encrypting Viruses
  ------------------
  Modification : The encrypting keys of the viruses were modified to
                 different values than those utilised by the existing
                 virus.

The samples were then assembled into binary code.

All the anti-virus products were then utilised to see how well their
detection systems were. Here surprises emerged.

Toolkit failed to recognise any one of the mutated code. Scan was able
to work for non-encrypted codes whilst fprot was able to detect all.

At the conclusion, I was horrified to think of the potential disaster
waiting to emerge for those using Dr Solomons. Finally I wish to file
a disclaimer that all these experiments were carried out without any
biase to any of the three products.

Hope that this info is of any use to users out there.

Sincerely

Sajid

It is then placed on ftp.twi.tudelft.nl in dir /pub/msdos/virus/tbscan
Then it is uploaded to oak.oakland.edu (& simtel20), garbo.uwasa.fi
and nic.funet.fi
We also mirror mcafee.com (McAfee software)

I use the latest version that I can get of each scanner.

I have been awaiting a newer version of UTscan for months, but it hasn't
arrived, so downloading the signature update from Fifth Generation BBS is the
best that I can do at the present time. Since the June 1993 signatures are
three months old I will be removing UTscan from the September release.

I am not penalizing any company.

I have contacts at Fifth Generation Systems, and at BRM in Israel the
developers of Untouchable, and several others.

It's not my fault that the new releases haven't arrived as promised, so I
updated the signatures to make UTScan as current as possible.

I post LAT into 16 virus related conferences, and for most of them the marjin
is 75 columns wide, and to get it to fit inside the marjins, I have to use
shorthand.

ZOO is short hand for my virus collections
SIGS is short Hand for SIGnatureS.

There haven't been many people that have asked me to explain the short hand.

Subject: Possible DOS/Windows virus... in the development stage? (!) (PC)

Preface: I know next to nothing about viruses.  This is not an actual
virus report.  This is a report of a letter received at my place of
employment that made me suspicious.  If anyone else has received a
letter like this, please post or email.  If anyone has any idea what
to do about the letter, please post or email.

I'm a grad student in computer science at the University of Maryland
at College Park.  On the side I work for Great Game Products in
Bethesda, Maryland doing C programming under DOS.  Recently Tom
Throop, president and founder of GGP, received a strange unsolicited
letter from someone wanting information on names, dates and times, and
sizes of executable files included in all of GGP's software products.

Figuring that it is better to be safe than sorry, I told Tom not to
give out any information until he knew more about how it was going to
be used.  The vagueness and unprofessionality of the letter and the
abnormal request for information about executables have made me worry
about the possibility of someone out there trying to write a virus or
viruses and masking them as software products from unsuspecting small
software companies who just answered a survey.

If I'm just being too paranoid, I apologize.  But if not, please let
me know what you think I should do.

Thanks.  The letter from "Cheyenne Software" and Tom's reply are enclosed.

- - Stephen

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Tom Throop:

I need information on all of your software products.  I need all of
them to be for DOS and/or Windows.  For this I would need to know what
version you have come out with (ex: 1.0, 2.0) and for the versions I
would need to know what the executable name is, the size of the file,
the date and time of the file.  If possible can you give me as many
different maintenance versions as you can.

The reason for me requesting this information is because I am doing a
database project for Cheyenne Software which will be used to check for
illegal copies of your product.  It also will be used for copy
protection.  This will benefit you by when we find an illegal copy we
will make them either buy it or get rid of it.

Please send that to Stephanie LaMarca at Cheyenne Software.  The fax
number is (516) 484-1853.  Please fax me back as soon as possible.  If
you need to contact me by phone my number is (516) 629-4424.  Thank
you.  And if you would like to contact me by mail it would be 3
Expressway Plaza, Roslyn Heights, NY 11577.

Sincerely,
Stephanie LaMarca

We may be able to help you with your project, but I would like to know
a little more about the project:

1.  What is your purose, and what funds are you putting up or
receiving from contributors or a client?

2.  If the funds are coming from a client, who is he, and what is his
objective?

3.  You say that upon finding an illegal copy, "we will make them
either buy it or get rid of it".  This is admirable, indeed, but by
whose authority will you act?  What mechanism exists for enforcement?

4. Is there existing publicity on the project?

Sincerely,
Tom Throop

Well I guess you have not tried my FixMBR from FixUtil5.  The point is
that just because DOS cannot find the hard disk that it is not there,
only that the partition table in the MBR or the DBR has become
lost/corrupted. In this case FDISK/MBR will not work & FDISK/STATUS
wll report odd things.

Somehow I have to wonder about the diagnosis though as I do not recall
EXEBUG fouling up the P-Table, just the CMOS floppy parameter.

The EXEBUG is rather strange in that it tries to prevent floppy booting
by telling the CMOS that drive A: is not there (by zeroing offset 10h -
see my CMOS.LST in the latest version of Ralf Brown's Interrupt List).

This is surmounted by re-selecting the floppy in the BIOS SETUP and
immediately booting from floppy.

					Good luck,
						Padgett

ps DiskSecure II is hardened against droppers & will flag any attempt (plug).

Doesn't sound like it. You might benefit from a book on hardware
maintenance of personal computers. Assuming any strange problems
to be a virus is usually a mistake.

It sounds like your A drive has a bad disc-change sensor. Try pulling
the drive out and cleaning any lint or dust from it (compressed air
works well), then reconnect and try it. Or, move your B drive to the
A drive position and try it. The sensor is usually a mechanical switch,
so look for something along where the back of the disc rests (when in
the drive) that is stuck or broken.

Unless you know it's a virus, don't format your hard drive. It's almost
never necessary, anyway.

Subject: 1530 or SVC? Disinfection? (PC)

*HELP*   Here I am again with another virus:

Yesterday I found an EXE file infected with a virus reported like this:

- - CPAV for Windows 1.0 does not find anything (which is normal 8^);
- - F-Prot 2.09d called it a "New or modified variant of SVC";
- -     Scan 104 called it "1530" with the ID 1530|;
- -     Scan 107 called it "June1530" with the ID J1530| (which
               does not appear in the VirList.TXT file).

Searching in VSumX307 I found a mention on the CB-1530, but I'm not
sure if it is the same virus, mainly because F-Prot thinks it may be a new
variant of SVC, -because of this, F-Prot does not make any attempt to disinfect
the strain-.  Clean 107 says it is not possible to disinfect the file
safely and suggests to overwrite it.

I found this virus on a 3.5 floppy disk; this disk is an ORIGINAL diskette
from IBM containing the installation software for PCSupport.  I checked
out other ORIGINAL diskettes with the same software and they are not
infected, so I suspect that this floppy was infected in a workstation
during the installation process (the file infected is INSTALL.EXE),
because the protection tab was closed, which allows write operations
to the floppy disk.

I fear that this virus is VERY propagated throughout the network:
we are experiencing problems since 2 weeks ago (workstation hangs,
unexpected machine boots, one or two lines of screen deleted when
trying to login into the token ring...).

What can I do?  The network cannot be shut down:  it must be working
24 hours a day.  We are losing time and money with those several
workstations that refuse to login into the network.  The most recent
copies of the BEST worldwide antivirus softwares (FProt and ViruScan,
of course) refuse to disinfect this virus...

Should I send it to Fridrik and Aryeh and wait for good news?
Should I reinstall ALL the software in EVERY workstation from
the non-infected original IBM disks (very time-consuming)?

Thanks for any help,

Subject: CRUNCH21.COM (PC)

Steven Hoke uploaded CRUNCH21.COM to the Metaverse BBS last night and
requested that I forward it to the A-V developers..

F-Prot 2.09 detects CRUNCH21 as possibly a Diet compressed Coffeeshop
dropper. F-Prot reports the same for the second generation too.

I ran the file on my test machine, and it requested permission before going
resident. I answered no on the first run just to check.

It will not go resident without an affirmative responce.

After running the file for the second time on my test machine, I gave it
permission to go resident, then ran my bait files.

My 10K bait files were reduced to 4K, and at first I had thought that it
was an overwriting virus.

I ran the bait files again, and they still ran properly. They were not
overwritten, just compressed, so it's not easy to tell the size of this
thing.

Since this requests permission, it shouldn't really be called a virus. I am
open to suggestions on what this type of program should be called.

This thing attaches to .COM and .EXE files, but ignores COMMAND.COM.

I am sending the first and second generation of this to David Chess,
Fridrik Skulason, and Wolfgang Stiller.

Previous versions of NukePox (2.0 and 2.1) cure the infected files on opening.
For removing the virus you should open the infected files by DOS function
OPEN (under active TSR virus, of course), and the virus will remove itself.
How to open these files? Try execute "copy . nul", or scan all files by
antiviral.

But these viruses infect the files again on closing, be careful! So, you
should open and close the infected file, and let the virus remove itself from
the file on opening and stop the infection on closing. To stop the infection
you should (your own TSR program should) intercept INT 2Fh and check the
functions 1220h and 1216h, these functions are called by the virus on
infection. My a-v monitor does it.

The second way: the old version of NukePox save the original 1Bh (27) bytes
of the file beginning at the file end. If new version is of the save
standard, you should move last 27 bytes of the infected file to its
beginning and cut the file at its 'entry point'. To automatize that
task you can use my toolkit which you can download from
ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de:/pub/virus/progs/avp_106b.zip

The last way: send the infected sample to a-v researchers and wait for updates.

Subject: "Moose" PC viruses (PC)

I sent a message to VALERT-L regarding these viruses on August 15,
1993. I now know a little more about the bastards:

1) It is probably at least four (or more) very similiar strains, all
   carrying the readable text string "Moose" in the code appended
   to infected files. Various version? numbers "30", "31", "32" -
   some of them with a space before the number - also in readable
   format follow the "Moose" text.

2) Different strains attack .EXE and .COM files. There are also
   instances of .SYS files being converted to .COM file format, in
   the latter case with the readable text string "This, and much
   more, from the Moose crashing corp" in the code.

3) Some files have been infected by two strains ("Moose31" and
   "Moose32").

4) All of the common virus scanning programs can successfully be
   taught to look for the "Moose" signature.

5) Some files have also had parts of Central Points CPAV.EXE file
   appended to them.

6) I have taken the trouble to disassemble all of the strains I have
   found. They are rather clumsily written and they all seem to do
   the same thing:
      i)  look for an uninfected file in the current directory. If
          not found, go to the overlying directory and try again
          (repeated until the root is reached).
     ii)  infect the uninfected file (if found)
    iii)  randomly change one byte in the program running by
          calculating a random address using
            IN AL,40h
          a three times, but only if a first reading gives a value
          below 10 hex. The random value also comes from the last
          reading.
     iv)  restore the initial directory
      v)  return to normal execution (which sometimes will fail if
          the random destruction part worked)
   To be frank, I don't understand what has happened in the cases when
   CPAV.EXE code has been added to the programs.

6) There is probably no memory-residency, boot sector or partition
   sector infection involved. My previously reported fears of stealth
   properties are probably not true - Solomon's PEEKA program behaves
   strangely also on non-infected PCs of the same make (Acer 486/33),
   so it is most probably an incompatibility problem.

There have been no other sightings of the virus reported at this
university campus (Alerts have been sent to all system managers).
I have, however, managed to track down students from this department
who have had their PCs at home infected, so the things are on the
loose !

I have had a few requests for samples - so far I haven't had the time
to do anything about this. For those with an urgent interest: I have
sent samples on diskettes to frisk@complex.is and McAfee's Swedish
representative.

Subject: virusses in .ARJ & .ZIP (PC)

Well, suppose you use McAfee VIRUSCAN.....   Adding an option /a like...

SCAN /a C:

Will cause the scanner to scan all the files, including the ZIPS......
But the bad thing is that since the files inside the archive are
re-coded, those scan would not be able to found out if there is a virus
in there....  What you can do for the next step is to D/L a file used to
do the procedure like   UNZIP->SCAN->ZIP
and so you can fully check if your user uploaded any viruses....

Hope that helps!

Subject: Re: Vshield v107 (PC)

Hello Mr. Rivera,

You write:

>I was just trying to get Vshield to loadhi under MSDOS 6.0/QEMM 7.01
>combo and while it worked fine before, now it refuses to loadhi.

This was a minor bug (buglet?) introduced in Version 107* of VSHIELD
when some debugging code was accidentally left in the program.  If
the "DOS =" statement in your CONFIG.SYS file did not mention loading
DOS into a UMB with either a "DOS=HIGH,UMB" or "DOS=UMB" switch, then
VSHIELD would not recognize that the Upper Memory Area was present and
as a result would not load high into an Upper Memory Block.  Replacing
your "DOS =" statement with "DOS=HIGH,UMB" will allow it to successfully
load high.

This will be fixed in V108, which should be available within the next
two weeks.

>I guess there is some incompatibility between the 2 programs.
>There's a lot of upper memory available and I have tried many
>different combinations using Vshield's options and still have the

Please feel free to contact me if you have any further problems.

PS:  For those wondering, V107 was released on August 25 but was not
     placed on our Internet site because of a problem that VIRUSCAN
     had with scanning PKLITE compressed files.  A new release, V108,
     is currently in beta-test which incorporates a fix for this
     problem.

Turns out that my lack of sleep and the last minute accomodation
of real IBM-PC ATs (not XTs) with BIOS dated 01/04/84 caused a bug
to creep into one of the rarely used peripheral files. This is fixed in
DS231b.ZIP just uploaded to URVAX.URICH.EDU.

Hi gang.

Just received from A. Padgett Peterson an update for his DiskSecure II.
DS2BYP wasn not usable with an AT using DOS 3.31.  Now this is corrected.

As usual:

- ----------
Site:       urvax.urich.edu,  [141.166.36.6]    (VAX/VMS using Multinet)
Directory:  [anonymous.msdos.antivirus]

FTP to urvax.urich.edu with username anonymous and your email address
as password.  You are in the [anonymous] directory when you connect.
cd msdos.antivirus, and remember to use binary mode for the zip files.
- ----------

The file is, obviously, DS231B.ZIP.

Best, Claude.
