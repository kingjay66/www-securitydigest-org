Indeed, I missed that one. In order to execute a program called
DIR.COM, one should enter some path in the front - e.g. ".\DIR".

More exactly, a command "dir.ext" is equivalent to "dir *.ext".

Another curious fact - the COMMAND.COM in MS-DOS and in PC-DOS differs
in the following behaviour. If the current directory contains files
FILE.COM and FILE.EXE, and you enter "FILE.EXE" from the command line
prompt, MS-DOS will execute FILE.EXE, while PC-DOS will execute
FILE.COM. This is valid only for COMMAND.COM; 4DOS behaves correctly
(i.e., it will execute FILE.EXE), regardless of the DOS brand it runs
under.

Subject: Draft Swiss AntiVirus regulation

To whom it may concern:

The Swiss Federal Agency for Informatics (Bundesamt fuer Informatik, Bern) is
preparing a legislative act against distribution of malicious code, such
as viruses, via VxBBS etc. You may know that there have been several attempts
to regulate the development and distribution of malicious software, in UK, USA
and other countries, but so far, Virus Exchange BBS seem to survive even in
countries with regulations and (some) knowledgeable crime investigators.

In order to optimize the input into the Swiss legal discussion, I suggested
that their draft be internationally distributed,  for comments and suggestions
from technical and legal experts in this area. Mr. Claudio G. Frigerio from
Bern kindly translated the (Swiss) text into English (see appended text, both
in German and English); in case of any misunderstanding, the German text is the
legally relevant one! Any discussion on this forum is helpful; please send
your comments (Cc:) also to Mr. Claudio G. Frigerio (as he's not on this list).

Subject: Rosenthal again..

A few days ago, an advertisement for the "Rosenthal WinLite" program
was posted to several newsgroups.

I have no objections to this product, which appears to do the job it
promises to do.  However, the package contains a textfile describing
certain other products from the same manufacturer, including his "Virus
Simulator".  The description of that product contains one statement that I
consider too misleading to ignore, as well as a personal insult:

    Additional articles appearing in "Computerworld", "Telecomputing",
    "Virus Bulletin" and "Virus News International", among others, make
    this latest version of Virus Simulator an absolute necessity...

To set the matter straight - it is ABSOLUTELY NOT the opinion of the Virus
Bulletin (of which I am the technical editor) that the "Virus Simulator" is
an "absolute necessity" ... we wrote:

    Rosenthal's virus simulator is of no use whatsoever, and may do more
    harm than good - for example by resulting in the selection of an
    inferior virus scanner - simply because its signatures were included
    in Rosenthal's database.

For those unfamiliar with the "simulator", it creates a set of files,
which contain fragments from viruses, but are not virus-infected.  It is
my opinion (speaking both as the VB technical editor and as the primary
developer of one of the most popular anti-virus programs), that the product
is of no use at all for comparing or testing anti-virus products.  The
generated files are *not* infected, and any detection of those files is in
effect a false alarm.  Why anyone would want to use this product is beyond
my understanding.

Well, let's compare the CD-ROMs with normal disks. First of all, they
are accessed via a user-loadable device driver. This makes it very
unlikely (I'm tempted to say "impossible") for a boot sector virus to
infect them. Furthermore, since they are not booted from (at least in
the MS-DOS world), they cannot be a source of a boot sector virus
infection.

Let's now consider the file viruses. Since the CD-ROMs are
permanently write-protected, there is no danger that the user will
accidentally infect them on an infected system. Therefore, the only
danger is that the producer accidentally puts infected files on them.

The implications of this are as from every other shrink-wrapped
software: if you are a producer, take care not to put infected
software on the media. If you are a user, scan every piece of software
you have obtained this way before using it.

Those are indeed the first two questions that a user asks: "Do I have
a virus?" and "How do I get rid of it?". However, inevitably s/he asks
also a THIRD question: "What does it do and what damage could it have
done to my data?". This is something that John seems to have

SCAN doesn't identify ANY viruses. It doesn't detect viruses; it
detects scan strings and decryptors.

Oh, you mean that it even doesn't -detect- reliably some polymorphic
viruses? Yes, indeed, that's very true. Off the top of my head I can
recall (about SCAN 108): V2P6.Z, Whale.33, -any- of the TPE-based
viruses... Probably I should do a more detailled test and post a list
of ALL viruses that SCAN doesn't detect reliably...

Easy - you don't. :-) SCAN cannot disinfect any virus - you have to
use CLEAN, which takes some more care when recognizing the particular
variant.

Because it will slow it down! Most people use only SCAN all the time
and resort to CLEAN only if they find a virus - which doesn't happen
that often and the time then doesn't matter.

> Scan is also hella-slow.

Heh... Have you tried CPAV? :-)

> I think SCAN will slowly become a heuristics

There are some problems with the heuristics - they give a lot of false
positives and false negatives. Each false positive means a call to the
Tech Support department. Each false negative means that somebody out
there will probably switch to a competitor's product.

I see the following compromise - a good known-virus scanner, combined
with heuristics with a very low level (almost 0) of false positives
and a relatively high level of false negatives. This way, there will
be almost no false positives, most known viruses will be detected, and
the scanner will be still able to detect a large class of unknown
viruses - and report something like "This seems to be a new virus,
please send a copy to...". This will improve the confidence of the
users in the product (because it will be almost always right) and
those viruses that it will not detect they will be ready to accept as
a fact of live - it will still be better than a scanner with no
heuristics.

SCAN's "generic boot" heuristic is pretty good - I know of no false
positives and it catches quite a lot new (to SCAN) boot sector
viruses. Their main mistake is to announce it as a particular virus
("Generic Boot"), instead of displaying a more sensible message,
suggesting that there seems to be a new, unknown virus in the boot
sector and that a sample should be sent to them. And, of course,
another mistake is to use that heuristic on -known- viruses, that they
could have detected with a scan string. In general, all methods to
detect known viruses should be used first, and only if they fail, the
scanner should resort to heuristics.

Simple. The virus occupies the whole MBR, overwriting the partition
table. When the virus is active in memory, it probably stealths the
MBR, so that DOS sees the original PT and is able to recognize the
partitions. When you boot from a floppy, the virus is no longer
present in memory, so DOS can't see the original PT and therefore
recognize the logical partitions.

> And what is the best way to proceed?

The best way is to find a scanner that can remove this virus.

Something to try is McAfee's CLEAN, used in the following way:

	clean c: [genp]

This is unlikely to succeed, however.

Another idea is to use Norton Disk Editor (or a similar tool) when the
machine is booted from the infected disk (and therefore the virus is
in memory); to read Side 0, Cylinder 0, Sector 1, and to save it on a
floppy as a file. Then boot from a non-infected write protected system
diskette (NOT the one on which you have saved the sector as a file,
because it is probably already infected), to start DE, read the file
containing the sector, and write it as physical sector 0/0/1 on the
first physical hard disk. However, this operation should be performed
by somebody knowledgeable - if you are not completely certain about
what you are doing in any of the above steps - don't even try it.

No wonder; it is almost certainly a false positive - see below.

Dunno. It's a High-Level-Language virus (written in Turbo C++) and I
don't feel like discompiling 23 Kb code. It contains the following
strings:

	I'm bored.
	Screw you.
	Life is a drag.
	kufc fof.
	Ouch! Don't hit me so hard.
	Floppy drive A: is flooded. Please insert J cloth.
	Murderer.
	You have been infected by ULTIMATION corp.
	Go directly to jail. Do not pass go. Do not collect $200.
	.Ah ha! Caught you.
	Copy protection error 23. Please re-install from master.

It probably displays them as some kind of joke. The strings are there
in plain text (not encrypted), so if those sispicious files are really
infected, you should be able to see this by browsing them with some
kind of file editor.

> b)  Could it be a false positive?

It almost certainly is. You see, it is very difficult to select a good
scan string for a HLL virus - because most of it is standard
libraries, which are likely to be found in legitimate programs as
well. That's why scanners very often give false positives on such
viruses.

Which means that Frisk has probably heard of the problem and has fixed
it.

It probably isn't.

FindVirus is probably right. And it very rarely gives false positives,
due to the way it identifies viruses.

There are indeed a few viruses which have such a video effect. You
should get a recent scanner and try to determine which virus exactly
it is and, of course, to get rid of it.

It does. Bad_Taste is a variant of Murphy, produced by the Italian
virus writer known as Cracker Jack. He often used ICE to conceal the
first generation (germs or droppers) of his viruses. Obviously, Frans
has picked in inappropriate scan string from the compressed file.

My advise to you - use UNP to unpack the file. Chances are that then
TbScan will stop even flagging it as suspicious.

Hi there Eugene. Im just wondering, would ThunderByte Anti-Virus v6.07 detect
this virus?

This bug is fixed in TBAV607 i believe. i was using a Wing Commander 2 TSR
cheat, which tbav605 identified as the froggy trojan which it wasnt.v607
fixed that problem now.

A while back (January 93) a few people posted sizes of their algorithmic
virus detectors.  Here are the line counts for a couple more detectors
included (or to be included) in IBM AntiVirus.

These counts are for lines of C; the code is not particularly dense.
The SatanBug (*) count includes some tables.  (File I/O handling is
*not* included in these counts.  The lines-of-code counter is a standard
counter used in many IBM development projects.  I'm not completely sure
what rules this lines-of-code counter uses.  Some lines are
counted as both code and comment lines.)

SatanBug ::= 421 physical lines, 173 comment lines, and 187 code lines
Tremor ::= 165 physical lines, 36 comment lines, and 107 code lines

(*) There is some disagreement about the name of this virus.

Anybody know of a virus (for IBM's) that reboots your computer without warning.
I'm not sure, but I think that these reboots take place about 30 min to an hour
after initial boot up.  I'm not sure if I have a virus or some weird hardware
problem.  In any case, its pretty annoying

Isn't CPAV one of the TSR's that can be disabled thru a simple DOS
function call??

Wouldn't offerring the user the option of disabling it, doing so on a
positive response, overwriting its memory space then scanning be
better??   8-)

Maybe even offer installing VIRSTOP instead (if it can be found on
the current machine)??

Subject: General note about fixing up behind an MBR infector (PC)

Sorry about the length here--if you want to cut straight to the guts of
this, look for the line of asterisks.

A simple thing struck me a couple of weeks ago, when bitten in the
following situation (I'm not identifying the a-v s/w in question becasue
the main point is valid --across-- disinfection prog's):

A technician from another dep't (usually independent of us for computer
support -because- they have their own techies), rung up to say that XYZ
had found Stoned on one of their lab PC's but was unable to remove/fix
it.  He had booted from a clean floppy, reformatted (DOS level only),
and restored all the software and data from their previous night's
backups (kept on Bernoulli (sp?) cartridges).

I was more than a little surprised, but noting a newer version of XYZ
had just become available (I'd d/l'ed it the previous night), I dumped a
copy to diskette and went over to look.  The updated version agreed they
still had Stoned on the machine.  I ran Norton's DISKEDIT and snarfed
the MBR to a file on another floppy (thinking XYZ's tech people might
like to have a look, but (as you will see below) presumably they were
already aware of the problem as the latest version didn't refuse to
disinfect it).  We ran XYZ's disinfection routine and it said all was
well again.

I patted myself on the back, and then (expecting sweetness and light,
and congratulations and thanks  8-) ), I reset the machine, only to be
faced with a whole slew of "Bad command or file name" and "Invalid drive
specification" errors.  Drive C: (DOS primary partition) was back, but
screwy, and only what had been F: from the extended partition was
visible, but (of course) now accessed as D:.

(Thinks: What the hell is going on??--think, think, think ... Bing!)

Did you re-partition before FORMAT and RESTORE??

"Yes, but I made the partitions -exactly- the same size!"

Aha.  I looked at the "old" PT now in the MBR (restored by XYZ in its
fix-up routine, by copying 0,0,7 back to 0,0,1).  I looked at the PT in
the MBR dump I'd made with DISKEDIT.  He -hadn't- make the partitions
"exactly" the same (about two cyliders out).  I simply edited the PT in
the MBR dump back into the fixed MBR, re-booted and all was sweetness
and light (they thought I was even more marvelous, not realizing how
easily NDD would have fixed this up if I hadn't made the copy of the
virus MBR).

*****************

OK.  I should have grilled their techie harder before starting.

BUT--I think that --before-- copying an MBR virus's "good" copy of the
MBR back over the virus code in the MBR, the PT's in the two places
should be compared, and if different the operator should be warned and
given a chance to copy the sector that is about to be "lost" off to a
file somewhere for later fixup purposes.

I am aware of viruses like Azusa which trash the PT in the physical MBR,
relying entirely on the copy they have tucked away, but for most MBR
infectors (certainly the common, Stoned-based ones), this would be a
simple additional safety check to put into disinfectors.

Comments??  (Apart from that I droned on too long!  8-) )

Vesselin is probably right - I put "quick and dirty" detection of Satanbug
in 2.09d, which has generated a few false positives.  However, all the
false alarms that have been reported to me have been in non-executable files,
so those users that use the scanner as instructed (only scan executable files,
until you actually find a virus - then scan everything, just to make sure you
don't miss something hiding in some obscure overlay file) would not have
encountered them.

These false alarms have (I believe) been fixed now.

Because the code was in memory - not active, of course, just located in some

Almost all Stoned variants infect floppies ONLY in drive A: (or
physical drive 0, to be exact). Actually, I can't remember a variant
that infects floppies in both drives, but wouldn't be usrprised if
such variant exists.

Why not? It's true that the virus is unable to infect 720 Kb diskettes
and the 1.44 Mb ones will be unreadable on most systems after
infection, but such an unreadable diskette will be still infective if
forgotten in a bootable drive at startup. Or am I missing something?

Probably not. In particular, the modified files do not contain a virus
- - no virus can be one bit long. (Well, at least no MS-DOS virus. It is
certainly possible to design a hypotetical machine on which a virus
could be one bit long.)

There is some probability that the modification is actually a damage
caused by a virus, but even this is unlikely.

> Or do I have a problem with my hardware?

This is one possible explanation of your problems. Or maybe the DOS
image on the hard disk is corrupted - try re-installing it from your
original diskettes. (That is, boot from the system diskette and run
SYS C:.)

Dunno about SCAN 106, but SCAN 108 calls it "Generic Boot" (sic), so
you could try to remove it with the command

	clean disk: [genb]

Otherwise, the virus is not mentioned at all in the docs - neither of
the list of viruses, nor in the list of viruses that Clean can
disinfect.

I don't have what you need in electronical form, but there is a very
good report on the virus implications to Novell (and Unix) servers by
Dr. Fred Cohen in the proceedings of the Virus Bulletin conference in
1992. The FAQ lists a contact address for Virus Bulletin.
