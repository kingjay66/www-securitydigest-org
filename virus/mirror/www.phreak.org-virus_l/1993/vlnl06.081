They *thought* they wre fully protected...unfortunately, they had not updated
their anti-virus software for two years.

I don't know about that.  A statement like that could be interpreted
to be directed at teaching people interested anti-virus techniques
some of the techniques that are currently being used by the virus
writers so they could be recognized and defeated.

I don't know Inbar Raz, Hex-40 or what else was said in this article.

to be the strongest evidence against Mr. Raz, and I just don't think

Not so.  Collisions are only relevant if the scanner spends a lot of
time traversing chains of hash table buckets.  I estimate that the
scanner I maintain (for IBM AntiVirus) can handle upwards of 10K search
patterns before speed starts to be a problem, and this is a bulk-mode
scanner, i.e. it can scan a buffer at nearly the speed of hard disk
I/O on a typical well balanced PC.  With some minor planned changes, it
could handle 10 times this many search patterns.

The main problem is memory for the search patterns themselves; the
memory requirement for in-memory search patterns for our scanner is
currently over 10 times the size of the table space used for hashing.

Qualix has recently taken the VFind product to market and I have
attached the Sunflash that was sent out this morning. To address your
point, it is not necessarily the UNIX viruses that VFind scans for but
dormant PC, MAC and AMiga viruses that are residing in the UNIX
information systems. By eliminating the dormant viruses they are now
unable to re enter the non-UNIX world to reinfect the systems the
viruses came from. VFind can also scan back up and new product media
prior to it being copied into the live environment.

Here is the recent SunFlash:

		VFind Now Available to the Non-government Market
	    "Virus Scanning Software for Heterogeneous Environments"
	----------------------------------------------------------------
	              ------------------------------------

      VFind   --  Scans for UNIX, MS-DOS, Macintosh and Amiga destructive
		  software on your UNIX system

	      --  Locates know viruses and other problems such as trojan
		  horses, worms, and logic bombs

	      --  can search entire disk drives and across all NFS networks

	      --  can be programmed to scan for keywords like "Top Secret"
		  or other confidential phrases

  Viruses have been observed infecting non-UNIX PCs attached to a
  heterogeneous network. The viruses came from the UNIX workstations
  but the UNIX systems were not the original point of entry for the
  viruses.  The viruses were dormant while on the UNIX nodes and became
  harmful when they migrated to their target system.  The UNIX systems
  acted as unaffected carriers of computer viruses for other
  platforms.

			VFind would prevent this situation.

  In addition to the situation described above there are several other
  types of harmful software that are native to and targeted against
  UNIX systems, including: trojan horses, logic bombs, and worms. Worms
  require an extensive amount of programming and are not considered an
  immediate threat. Trojan horses appear to be performing desired
  processing while creating damage.  They are spread by unsuspecting
  users who copy them in order to take advantage of their userfulness.
  Logic bombs, or time bombs, are simple programs that wait for an
  event to occur, such as midnight, and then damage the system.


			VFind would detect these viruses.

Subject: Jerusalem can be a PAIN IN THE BUTT (PC)

       My friend's computer recently had a brush with death; he previously
       thought he was impenetrable to viruses because he hardly used his
       computer. Well, he borrowed a disk off someone and contracted the
       Jerusalem virus. Slowly each of his .exe and other executables
       became infected- eventually NOTHING would work. He became a believer
       in virus protection the moment McAfee discovered [Jeru]. Has anyone
       else had run ins with Jerusalem?

Integrity Master's scanner component with reliably detect this polymorphic
virus but we don't offer removal beyond automatic (optional) deletion
of infected files.

I sincerely hope that you're not depending upon "disinfection" or "cleaning"
technology to recover from viruses.  It's simply not safe to depend upon
this technology.  While it may be convenient to use such programs, it's
vital to also have reliable, current backups. Even the most common file
infector of all, the Jerusalem virus, will not be correctly removed from
all infected files by any product that we're familiar with.   The virus
infects some files in such a way that some of the original program can't
be correctly reconstructed without saving all or part of the original
program prior to the infection.  Beyond this, there are a large number
of viruses that no program reliably "disinfects", either because the
virus overwrites part of the original code or because no one has written
disinfection code for this virus yet.

Subject: TREMOR-infected virus-scanner? (PC)

Hi there,

	bad news is circulating in Germany: a private televison station
usually spreads shareware among the people by sending it in a datachannel
overlaid to their normal TV-program, using a special decoder hardware
people can separate the data from the movies and download. They call it
CHANNEL VIDEODAT. Now, newspapers claim that during the transmission last
friday also the latest version of "a famous american virus scanner", which
itself was infected by the TREMOR virus had been transmitted, and lots of
computers had been infected. As no newspaper calls the "famous scanner" by
its name, my question is:

	Which scanner is infected by TREMOR?
	Which scanner can disinfect TREMOR?

I would be nice if someone could give a statement. 

Thanks a lot,
	and best regards.

>STONED is a MBR-infector and cannot spread via nets(!). 

While this is true for the virus itself, it is quite possible for a
"dropper" in .COM or .EXE form to exist and to spread the STONED or any
other MBR infection via a LAN. This is a trojan horse that inserts the 
virus into the boot sector when it executes. Since it does not go resident 
a memory scan will detect nothing and unfortunately few scanners detect 
droppers in files. (F-Prot in "heuristic" mode will detect some).

BIOS level detection such as are available from AMI and AWARD are effective
at detecting this sort of thing as are resident integrity checkers, 
particularly those that start at the BIOS level (such as my DISKSECURE 8*).

Answers to this and similar questions presently being discussed 
on this list *are* in the FAQ! For example,

D8)  Will a write-protect tab stop viruses?
E11) Can I contract a virus on my PC by performing a "DIR" of an
     infected floppy disk?
E12) Is there any risk in copying data files from an infected floppy
     disk to a clean PC's hard disk?

Perhaps the most Frequently Asked Question ought to be:
  "Who does look at the FAQ?" .

There is no such thing as the RAM virus.  Somebody gave Patty a sample which
was infected with two viruses - Cascade and Jerusalem, I think.  This
combination works perfectly together, but she did not realize the nature of
the sample, and seemed to think this was one new virus.

There are some other non-existing viruses in VSUM as well, but they are mostly
for "copy protection" purposes....

The problem is of course that CPAV/MSAV just leaves virus signatures in memory.
Maybe they will fix the problem, but I would not bet on it - Central Point
has caused more problems for the anti-virus industry than most virus writers
IMHO....as somebody said "with friends like that, who need enemies" :-)

Subject: Strange smiley faces in Directory (PC)

A friend of mine has a Vendex 8088 clone with no hard drive and the usual
dual 5.25 floppies.  She runs an old DOS 2.01 which I believe is
called "Headstart". Lately she has been having some weird file corruption.  

Some files cannot be pulled up with her word processor (Easy Working
Writer by Spinmaker) sometimes the next day after she makes the file
(the file would open the same night, generally).

When she does a dir on the disk containing the file (within the WP
program) she gets some bizzare stuff (mind you I have not seen this,
it is a verbal description).

In the Filename column, some files are OK, but others have what looks
like an oblong smiley face, followed by a two-headed up/down arrow, a
backward digit 2, another smiley face and a down arrow.  The size and
date are blank and the time contains a smiley face and a left arrow.
Thes files cannot be opened.  In the DOS shell, a dir command yields
the same thing except that the filename contains a few more nonsense
characters and the size column has a 90 degree right arrow (with
two arrowheads) and a smiley face followed by the number 721592361.
Mind you that this is a 360k drive and there is 200+k left on the
disk!  Under DOS the same file has a creation date of 8-02-99 and a
time  of 12:01 PM. 

Other corrupt files have creation dates of 0-00-80 and time of 0:00 AM,
some are blank lines and, as I said, some are normal.  Some files have
extra columns AFTER the TIME field which contain a slash and what
looks like a diamond, or they may have other strange characters.

What the hell is this???  

It seems to have started soon after she bought the Easy Writer
software at an Egghead outlet store for a low price.  It is happening
more and more and some files are OK one day and corrupted the next,
all in a similar (although not exactly the same) manner.  A screen
print shows pretty much what the screen shows, but is spaced
differently.  She never uses BBS software, mainly because of the lack
of a hard drive.

Other possibly related troubles include a modem that won't respond to
Procomm+ commands untill it is unplugged and plugged back in.  The
response code to an attempt to boot Procomm+ is "Critical error 4" and
if she hits retry she gets the same error message, if she hits
'ignore' it will boot properly.

PLEASE reply in email asap, I don't have much time these days to read
news, and articles get expired pretty fast here.  My friend depends on
her clunker computer for her newspaper reporting job, and we need some
ideas.  She does not have a virus program.

Howdy out there. 

I used to get my macafee updates (we're all paid) from the
192.187.128.1 site, but it no longer accepts anonymous logins.

Anyone know where I can get 'em?

This is a current listing of IBM antivirus files available via anonymous
FTP from risc.ua.edu (130.160.4.7).  Please let me know if you see any
files that are out of date or missing.....(isn't vcopy82.zip an old file
from McAfee?  Should it be there?)

Thanks.
