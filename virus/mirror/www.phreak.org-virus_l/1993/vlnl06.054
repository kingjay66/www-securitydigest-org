Subject: April Fools' Day disclaimer

VIRUS-L/comp.virus readers:

It is with great consternation that I include the following disclaimer
in today's digest:

For the humor-challenged, today (1 April 1993) is April Fools' Day.
Lest any of the gems in this digest be mistaken for anything less than
the good-natured humor for which they were intended, please be advised
that THE MESSAGES IN THIS DIGEST ARE JOKES.  (Well, except for this
one...)

Anyway, enjoy these JOKES on this April Fools' Day, and remember - ten
thousand lemmings can't be wrong!  ;-) Special thanks to all those
that contributed to today's digest; I owe you each a homebrew!

Cheers,

Subject: Viral ghosts and other computer faults here; break in Virus-L service

  Subsequent to the recent succession of 'sightings' by PC antivirals of
ghosts of killed viruses, a recent wave of otherwise unexplained miscellaneous
computer errors and programming occurences was suspected to be due to activity
by these ghosts. Early this morning the Ghostbusters were called. They found
and removed four Jerusalem and three DIR-II and two other viral ghosts which
had become free-roamers with gremlin tendencies, and the ghosts of two former
computer operators, and the ghost of a man who died in a fall from his horse
on this site in 1823. Their Mr.P.Venkman said after a thorough PKE search that
our computer building is now free of ghosts and similar harmful infestations,
and commented that "past-life repeaters all too often become hostile on
finding that they have the will but not the skill to continue the occupations
that they had before death.".
  However, as in the process link wiring and a disk drive were damaged by
beams from their proton packs, no more Virus-L issues can be sent out for the
next week.

Subject: Wanted:missing *Ninja Turtles*!

Virus Test Center would very much appreciate any help in finding, identifying
      and securely catching the following missing *Ninja Turtles*:

      *Donatello*, possibly a UNIX virus living on NeXT systems, said to
         kill all files on March 5! Alternately, may live on Amigas! 
 
      *Leonardo* and *Rafaelo* whose system basis is not known, and whose
         activities and trigger conditions are also unknown.

All three are members of the family of *Ninja Turtles*, from a French comic on
4 turtles named, by their master former Mr. Hamato *Joshi* now  Mr. Splinter
(who was converted into a *Rat*) after his 4 favorite Italian painters, 
including master turtle *Michelangelo* (known to "live" on PC-DOS and killing 
21 MByte on March 6). At this time, only *Michelangelo* (which is also known
as Ninja Turtle in Asia) has appeared in the public and reproduced worldwide. 
Some messages refer to some *Donatello* virus (Amiga?, NeXT?), but nothing is 
known about their sister turtles.

Background info #1: Ninja Turtle is a comic about 5 former humans which were
       transformed into animals when contaminated with radioactive mud. While
       master Mr. Hamato Joshi was transformed into a rat with the name
       Splinter, the other 4 became turtles named after 4 Italian painters
       (see below). Splinter has a girlfriend named April.

Background info #2: The following relations to existing malicious software
       (esp. viruses) have been found:
          - Ninja Turtle is the Taiwanese alias of Michelangelo virus
          - Joshi and Rat are PC viruses (April 1st in Jerusalem strain)
          - Donatello was the name of some "file" which has been found
            on a NeXT machine in a US university, in 1992; moreover,
            a virus of this name has been mentioned on Amigas.

Background info #3: the referenced Italian painters had the following life-
dates:
       Donatello: born 1386 (day/month not known),        died 13-Dec-1466
       Raffael:   born 1483 (day/month probably 6-April), died 6-April-1520
       Leonardo:  born 15-April-1452,                     died 2-May-1519

All information concerning the turtles securely contained on diskette should be
send to

Subject: WARNING - virus hits Florida!

Recently, the University of South-West Florida Agicultural Laboratory 
discovered that several hundred of their floppy disks had become
unusable and when accessed fouled the heads of the disk drives used
requiring complete disassembly/cleaning of affected drives.

The cause has been isolated as a gene-spliced mutation of a tobacco
mosaic that had been used for laboratory experiments. Inadvertant
exposure to mutagens resulted in a new strain with an appetite for
ferric oxides used to coat floppy disks (both 5 1/4 and 3 1/2). The
residue left by the new strain caused the fouling of the heads in
affected drives.

Unfortunately, the problem was discovered only after distribution
of several thousand disks relating to citrus projections that were
sent to agencies and universities worldwide.

The mosaic reverts to a dormant state when exposed to temperatures
below 60 degrees F and takes from a week to a month to revert to
an active state following dormancy.

The noted USWF researcher, Dr. Ludwig Von Drake, was quoted as saying:
"Well now we have a real computer virus".

 [I thought this would be of interest to the readers.  I don't know
  who compiled the list originally.

problem.

CONGRESSIONAL VIRUS 2: Runs every program on the hard drive
simultaneously, but doesn't allow the user to accomplish anything.

FEDERAL BUREAUCRAT VIRUS: Divides your hard disk into hundreds of
little units, each of which does practically nothing, but all of
which claim to be the most important part of the computer.

GOVERNMENT ECONOMIST VIRUS: Nothing works, but all your diagnostic
software says everything is fine.

are getting.

THE MCI VIRUS: Every three minutes it reminds you that you're paying
too much for the AT&T virus.

PBS VIRUS: Your PC stops every few minutes to ask for money.

POLITICALLY CORRECT VIRUS: Never calls itself a "virus," but instead
refers to itself as an "electronic microorganism."

OPRAH WINFREY VIRUS: Your 200MB hard drive suddenly shrinks to 80MB,
and then slowly expands back to 200MB.

TEXAS VIRUS: Makes sure that it's bigger than any other file.

supply, and a set of shocks.

NEW WORLD ORDER VIRUS: Probably harmless, but it makes a lot of
people really mad just thinking about it.

GALLUP VIRUS: Sixty percent of the PCs infected will lose 38 percent
of their data 14 percent of the time (plus or minus a 3.5 percent
margin of error).

Has anyone heard anything about the following virus?  We are VERY concerned:

 > We have found a new virus on our local systems.  Analysis of the code
 > reveals the following:
 > The virus contains the text "LEFco" and infects either files, boot 
 > sectors, or partition tables ... (Actually, it can't decide!)
 > The virus tries, but it can't go resident because it disables the CPU's 
 > memory management and scheduling and installs its own "organizer" routines.
 > These routines are highly ineffective and cause tremendous system 
 > disorganization, leading to utter chaos and pandemonium.  Printers produce  
 > disk output, disks begin printing, and monitors play "Dazed and Confused". 
 > The virus blames this chaos on other system applications such as CHKDSK. 
 > On multitasking systems, processes and sessions will randomly appear and
 > disappear without warning.  In fact, some of the sessions will rearrange 
 > and jump into other sessions!
 > The virus also invites other viruses to your machine and forces them to use
 > tokens before allowing them to sit on the hard drive. Unfortunately, there
 > isn't enough disk space and the extra viruses are forced to stand in 
 > memory or go out on floppy diskettes.
 > After the confusion, the virus keeps printing "Next year will be better!
 >
 > This is the worst virus we've ever seen!  Oh! The humanity!
 > Please!  Can someone help us!! 

If you have had any experience with such a virus, please send advice, 
helpful hints, and suggestions.  However, we won't have time to read them,
so you might as well copy them to NUL or /dev/null.

Thanks anyway!
