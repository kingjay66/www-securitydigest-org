Subject: Mixed IBM & MAC LANs

While "cross-polinating" viruses have not appeared as yet (and are
difficult to write), such a client/server network can spread viruses
very quickly among homogeneous clients unless precautions are taken.

Further, while "first-generation" anti-virus programs exist for
the  Novell Netware/IBM environment, I know of no such top-level
defense for MACs.

As a result, and since MACs will only access MAC software (except
for DOS boxes) and IBMs will access only IBM software, if anything,
the mixed nature of such a heterogeneos system makes it *more*
likely to become infected by a virus than a single platform system,
and less likely to have a proper defense.

Artisoft LANTASTIC was also mentioned (have 4.1 but not 5.0 - yet)
and it shares the limitation of any peer-peer network in not having
login scripting capacity & such is yet another step down from client/
server in robustness. I do not know of any heterogeneous peer-peer
LANs as yet though daya sharing is certainly possible.

					Warmly,

Of course, a good thing to keep this going, but what about TPE detection? 
The just released 1.14 version of our product PCVP detects the TPE as well as 
the next TBSCAN. I think that now almost all packages do detect the MtE, 
people will start to use TPE (and future engines) as it is stupid to use
a mutation engine which already is detected by the majortity of scanners.

All the XCHNG R,R should be suitable
There are a number of CMP AL,#immediate type instructions that have
one and 2 byte versions. so th one byte version and a NOP should be swappable
with the 2 byte version.

Jmp short NOP and Jmp dd where dd and d are signed displacements can be inter

Subject: WordPerfect File growth etc. (PC)

I have seen the same problem with WordPerfect file growth in a Banyan
environment.  We have traced it to users exiting WordPerfect abnormally.
Meaning that they either use cntrl-alt-delete to exit, or they turn off their
machines while still in WordPerfect.  This causes WordPerfect to create a huge
file sometimes in excess of available disk space.  The only way to prevent
this from happening is to educate your users not to abnormally exit from 
WordPerfect.  This is a known bug by WordPerfect, I imagine that they will
address it in the next release if enough people complain.

Regarding a comment that Richard Ford made about using FDISK or SYS while a 
virus is memory resident.  It is not always the case that this will cause
the disk to be re-infected if the system has booting from the floppy disabled.
In fact, several viruses can successfully be eradicated using this technique
although it is not advised.  The reason for this is simple.  Many viruses
like the Michelangelo will perform an "are you there call" before attempting
to infect the MBR.  If they find that they are there in memory already, then
they assume that they have already infected the MBR and no longer need to do
this.  Therefore, if you replace the MBR with these type of viruses in memory
and then shut down the machine and reboot you should come up clean.  Again,
this is not true for all MBR viruses, but it is true for some like the Michel-
angelo.

You can't by normal, file-based means... The DOS image of the file is the same 
as before, while the physical image, which is relevant at boot time, has 
changed :-(.

Well dear Padgett, it seems like you didn't quite get my idea: There is no 
problem in checking that the original INR-13 ISR is located on the BIOS area (
except if you are using some smart PC that does the shadowing of the BIOS to 
another area in RAM location and completely remapps the adresses), However 
that is not the issue here. When you know the location of the original INT-13 
ISR is when the system is already booted (or in the process) but *AFTER* the 
IO.SYS is loaded (unless your Anti Virus is also an operating system which you 
will excuse me for not believing it is so).

Therefor, your program cannot tell you that the original boot sector or 
partition table is replaced!
Remember that AFTER what you call BIOS time (nice term) the BIOS usually does 
not necessarily continue to supply INT-13 services.

A. I agree that a virus does not intercept a FAR CALL, but only    hooks an 
interrupt.
B. To know where to make the far call to, you should be a    Gypsy and own a 
crystal ball to consult with. Because    what ever YOU consider predictable is 
not so in reality.
   The "original" procedure is located somwhere in the    system depending 
which program took it. You cannot assume    that the INT-13 ISR is in a 
constant place nor can you    assume it is a part of the BIOS, because if you 
do, your    program is likelly to crach a lot of PCs especially those    that 
use special low level programs like Access control to    disks, and several 
Network tools. So much for    predictions.
C. Did I ever say that the virus infects the ROM ? You have    to be very 
ignorent to say so.
D. I'd reccomend that the student will learn a little more    about programs 
and utilities before writing programs that    makes the PC a solid rock with 
no flexibility (interrupts    hooked in place forever by some Anti-Virus).

I'm sorry to be the one that lets you know that int-25 & 26 are translated 
eventually into INT-13. Just as INT-21 Fn 02 (write char) is translated into 
INT-10. So you see, what you wrote is incorrect. Ther is *NO* are on the 
formatted disk surface that is not acessible via INT-13.

Since you are new here, let me first welcome you.

As for TSRs, I think you are way out of time in starting again the encient 
discussion of TSRs or not. Juust to remind
you V-CARE is equipped with a TSR for quite some time already,
and as a TSR writer myself, I think I may express my poinion
about them.

Second thing: your *"DOS is built for TSRs"* flag ship is not correct (
historically speaking). "DOS supports TSRs" is a much better term. However the 
main problem is that DOS is an operating system that suffers from the lack of 
standartization, thus causing conflicts and crashes between programs, and 
since TSRs use system resources in the most intensive way they are the main 
cause for conflicts.
Evidently it seems you've missunderstand my view on TSRs and so you keep 
answering to things I do not say.

Thired: You do not have to warn anybody using other TSRs like keyboard 
handlers since they do not tamper with the set of interrupts used to acess the 
disk. As for QEMM386 I'm surprized that a man with such an experiance as you 
claim to have does not know thet EMM386 has many conflicts, which makes a lot 
of users switch to QEMM (which also has a lot of different conflicts).

Last but not least: If it didnt happened to yet I truelly hope it never will, 
but Double disk for example conflicts with several optimization programs and 
some utilities,
the result is fatal, I've experianced it myself several times.

Subject: Virus signature determination. (PC)


I'm planning to expand an anti-viral utility to include file
scanning, like Mc'Affe's scan program does. Therefore I would
be interested in more information of how I determine the signature
of any virus, including mutating ones. I know that I 
could allow one virus to infect multiple files, and then do a
file comparsion to find the equalities between the files. This
however would probably result in very long signatures (if not 
the entire virus, which would make it fatal to distribute the
signature file). Just taking the very first bytes of the virus
into account, would however cause to many false alarms.

Is it also possible to get signature files from somewhere and 
implement them in the package? (The format of the files would
ofcourse be of ultimate interest.)

 Some virus scanners do protect against these types of viruses (I
believe ViruScan does this somehow...). YES! There are viruses out there
that do this. I don't know about "Removing" themselves from memory, but
the way that many of the techniques are accomplished, are by not
infecting the Scanner (To avoid a faulty CRC check), and then using the
scanners Func. 3Dh/INT 21h (Open file) call in order to infect the file.

 Some viruses that do this are later versions of DataRape (Aka: Sunday
2), NPOX (NukePox), and I believe Horse does this as well (Can't really
remember, I don't have the source code handy...) Also, any other
disinfect-on-the-fly virus is able to do this as well (NPOX v2.0+,
1963...)

 They do exist...

where specific viruses usually can be expected to be found ? Some of them 
are probably all over the world, but every now and then I read, that virus

Subject: Re: EXE/COM switch (PC)

JR sent me a scathing letter (which was cross posted here) saying
that the EXE/COM switch was "simply dangerous" to use. There was
no explanation, but one could infer that JR was concerned about
having a false sense of security that the EXE/COM switch would
give because it would only work against "stupid" viruses.

Of course no SINGLE mechanism which JR uses is sufficient to
prevent a virus infection. Surely JR uses a variety of techniques.
In this case, I once threw out an estimate that this would
work against 50% of all viruses. To my regret, nobody attempted
to produce a more accurate figure. I guess I could make a
tabulation based on lists like the one in CPAV, but I didn't
want to use figures from a source that people seem to dislike
on this forum.

If I came up with a device that could prevent 50% of all plane
crashes, would that also be a "dangerous" device because it
would give a false sense of security?

For people who use scanners, I don't think the EXE/COM switch
buys much. It wouldn't "add another 50%" in that case. For people
who know enough to poke values into COMMAND.COM to change COM
to CCC, this method probably wouldn't help much either. These
people probably have other defenses set up.

The EXE/COM switch is only useful for a certain group of people,
like maybe my parents, who had to call me the other day to ask
which way they stick a 3.5" floppy diskette into the drive. :-)
However even they, like me, don't share executeables, so not
even a scanner would do us much good.

Anyway lots of people want copies of the article on virus attacks on those
nice people who help us buy cars in Singapore.

BUT I posted the article ages ago, and only today has it surfaced so I'm
not sure I can find the article so easily (This is an explanation, not a
criticism of our ref., who probably has better things to do)

I'll try and locate it. But bear in mind that the people who write on
viruses in the STRAITS TIMES are no better than the people who write on
viruses in newspapers anywhere. . . .

Subject: VirusCheck 3.0 looking for Beta testers (PC)

VirusCheck 3.0 is well underway and looking for BETA TESTERS.

What is it?

	VirusCheck is a watchdog/shell for McAfee Associates ViruScan
virus scanning software.  It eliminates the need for many custom batch
files to accomodate different machines and eliminates the need for the
user to sit and watch while his system is being scanned.

	VirusCheck is designed around US Marine Corps anti-virus policies,
yet is flexible enough to be in use by many agencies and thousands of
users world-wide.  It will insure that the entire system gets scanned.
(How many of your network users or temporary employees know how many
partitions are on the system(s) they use?)  It will monitor the exit
code returned by ViruScan and lock the system if a virus is found.

	VirusCheck also includes "policy enforcement tools" for the
local area network administrator to use.  Using this utility (affectionately
named "the Enforcer") will deny network access to any user who does not
comply with the established anti-virus policy (as long as that policy
is the use of VirusCheck/ViruScan).

	VirusCheck 2.3b has been in production use throughout the US
Marine Corps and on tens of thousands of other systems since November 91.
Version 3.0 is a complete, ground-up re-write with many new and improved
features.

If you are interested in BETA TESTING this new version, you can obtain it
in the following ways:

	Download from my BBS -- dial (516) 483-5841, settings n81,
		300-9600 V.32, login "guest", password "guest",
		download /public/dos/virus/vc3beta.exe

	Via mail-server -- send mail to "mail-server%jaflrn@uunet.uu.net"
		the subject line will be ignored, include the text
		"get dos/virus/vc3beta.exe"; if you also need ViruScan,
		"get dos/virus/scanv102.zip" will get it.  The files will
		be sent to you via return e-mail in multiple UUEncoded
		segments.

	Snail-mail -- send a stamped, self-addressed diskette mailer and
		your preferred format diskette (360K through 1.44M) to:
			Jon Freivald
			269 Mitchel Ave
			East Meadow, NY 11554

Subject: Catch from DIR? (PC)

I have received some excellent replies to my posting on catching
a virus.  Basically the question is this:  Assume my system is
clean and I have an infected disk.  I put the disk in the drive
and do a DIR.  Then I take the disk out.  Can my system be
infected now?

The responses are running about 1/3 saying no way and 2/3 saying
it is possible.  I would really like to get a definitive answer. 
If a virus can be passed in this way, would someone please
describe how it might happen?  Or not.

Thanks.

I'm sorry to hear that tou were affected by Michelangelo.

CNN posted a little blurb about Michelangelo on March 5th. Apparently 
their informant wasn't very well informed. but they did spread  the word 
about Michelangelo set to attack on March 6th. But Michelangelo is not a 
file infector.

Michelangelo is a variant of Stoned, and hides in the boot sector of 
diskettes, and the partition table of hard drives.

	I was wondering if anyone can tell me about how this virus
works? Does it only affect that one day or does it tag allow somwhow
onto things posted on "nn"? Anything you can tell me would be
appreicated do that I can know what to look for. 
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Michelangelo is a variant of Stoned. Meaning that it hides in the boot 
sector of diskettes, and partition table of hard drives.
 
Michelangelo is detectable, and removable by most if not all scanners.
 
When the hard drive is infected, the virus goes resident, taking about 2K 
of memory below the 640K limit.
 
It will infect diskettes (even high density diskettes) as they are 
accessed in A:

Subject: [Stoned] (PC)

Has anyone heard of the [Stoned] virus and if so, then what does it do?

Also, I have an odd question concerning infected disks...If I have an
infected disk and run a magnet across it, will all data (and the virus) be
erased???
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stoned is a rather benign virus except for when it infects irregular hard 
ware.
 
Stoned hides in the boot sector of floppies, and the partition table of 
hard drives.

McAfee's Clean can remove the virus from hard drives, and floppies.
 
the command is
 
CLEAN C: [STONED]               
 
substitute the drive letter when removing Stoned from diskettes.

Subject: McAfee's Clean-output (PC)

Dear networkers,

I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this, but I'll do it
anyway. Maybe some of you have noticed that the screen output from
both SCAN.EXE and CLEAN.EXE (from McAfee Associates) is different from
the output produced when the /REPORT option is used. The output in the
report file is very brief and (for example) doesn't show if a virus is
(or isn't) removed: it only tells that a virus has been found. Why is this? 
The reason why I ask this is that I would like to process the report files
from SCAN.EXE and CLEAN.EXE in order to automatically eliminate any virus
that is found with a self-written program. So IMHO the output in the report
files should be more elaborate or at least the same as the screen-output
(this applies to both SCAN.EXE and CLEAN.EXE).

Example:
Output on the screen from CLEAN.EXE when cleaning [Stoned]:

Cleaning [stoned]

Scanning for memory resident viruses.
Scanning 64K RAM......
Drive B: has no volume label.
Scanning boot sector of disk B:

  Found the Stoned [Stoned] Virus in boot sector.
  Virus cannot be safely removed from boot sector. <--- Yes, message is there
                
 Found 1 file containing viruses.

     This McAFEE(TM) software  may.....
     Copyright (c) McAfee Associates 1989-1993. All Rights Reserved.

Output in the report file by CLEAN.EXE (with /report option) when
cleaning [Stoned] (the same disk with the same virus):

Options: b: [stoned] /a /m /chkhi /nopause /unattend /report c:\clean.log

Drive B: has no volume label.
  Found the Stoned [Stoned] Virus in boot sector.
- ---> Am I missing something here? <----

 Found 1 file containing viruses.

So perhaps this could be fixed in futures releases.

Thanks,
Rutger

                                77 AMIGA viruses (15 new ones)
         MSDOSVIR.ZIP           the cumulative MSDOSVIR.files, now classifying
                                156 MSDOS viruses and trojans (32 new ones)
         MACVIR.ZIP             the cumulative MACVIR files; no update since
                                July 1992 (.792) as no new viruses were found
         ATARIVIR.ZIP           the old AtariVir files (20 viruses) not updated
                                as we have no new viruses for analysis.

The single UNIX virus (AT&T Attack) will be sent on request (on ftp soon). 
In the new MSDOSVIR.293 file, the following new PC viruses are classified:

       10_past_3 (2), Adolf, Alabama, Chemnitz, Exe_Bug (2), Flip, Hey_You,
       Kampana=Spanish Telecom (2), Minimal (15), Techno, VOID_POEM, V-163
       and V-Sign/CANSU.

Moreover, characteristic features of viruses generated by the following author-
ing packages are also classified:
 
       PS-MPC and VCL.

As announced last year, the new *machine readable CVC version* called CVBASE
is also available for downloading: cvbase-293.zip. CVBASE allows to display
all CVC entries (in total 288, on Amiga, Atari, Mac, MsDos and the single UNIX
virus), under option VIRUS, but also gives an OVERVIEW and STRAIN relationsship
about All (about 2,200) viruses in the CARO/VTC collections (using CARO naming
scheme) as well as the VTC collection on Amiga (77), Atari (20), Mac (35) and
Unix (1). From STRAIN, one may read available CVC entries. 

     *Any suggestions how to improve this version are welcome*
