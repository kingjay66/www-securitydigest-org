Can't help with #2 but for some reason about a month ago I got a bug about
the same thing & after more research than sanity should permit came up
with a little utility that I plan to make available as FreeWare which
can do the following.

1) Identify the hardware address of the client machine (burned into FirmWare
   and unique to every Ethernet card - with a database could translate to
   system number and location)

2) Identify the manufacturer of the Ethernet card (possibly not interesting
   but thanks to Michael Patton's EtherNet-Codes, I had it available.

3) Tell whether the machine has TCP/IP capability or just IPX/IPXODI.

It will then return errorlevels & can be piped to more intelligent things
as part of a login script to determine at least the first part of what
Mr. Overton has asked for.

Is anyone interested ?

Subject: Re: Draft Swiss AntiVirus regulation

It's always good to see a country framing anti-virus legislation, but
I was puzzled by the Swiss draft (VIRUS-L Digest V6 #133). It strikes
me as linguistically ambiguous, surely not a good idea. The text runs:

"Wer unbefugt elektronisch oder in vergleichbarer
Weise gespeicherte oder uebermittelte Daten loescht,
veraendert oder unbrauchbar macht, oder Mittel, die
zum unbefugten Loeschen, Aendern oder Unbrauchbarmachen
solcher Daten bestimmt sind, herstellt oder anpreist,
anbietet, zugaenglich macht oder sonstwie in Verkehr
bringt, wird, auf Antrag, mit der gleichen Strafe belegt."

Now surely the phrase "elektronisch oder ...Weise" could qualify either
"gespeicherte" (as [presumably] in the translation offered) or "loescht"
(indicating that the law is against viri rather than against, say, the
burning of floppies)? Is there something special in Swiss German which
could distinguish between the two possibilities:

(a) Anyone who without authorisation uses electronic or similar means to
erase, alter or render useless saved or transmitted data; or manufactures..

(b) Anyone who without authorisation erases, alters or renders useless
data electronically (or by other means) saved or transmitted ...

And what is the significance of adding the "transmitted" ("uebermittelte")?
Does it clarify or only obscure? Surely legislation above all should be
crystal clear in its intent?

The second part sounds incredibly draconian. Does this mean that
an unknowledgeable user who unknowingly passes on an infected file,
is committing a crime?
What about sending a virus to a researcher, taking all sensible
precautions?
Is the punishment automatic if a complaint is filed? In some countries,
it is also necessary to prove guilt.

    How does this law marks the difference between format.com and a

make available a virus even to an anti virus researcher? I can sue
Microsoft for making available format.com? I can use format.com to
destroy all data in my boss's computer... I think we can imprision a

    The point is: what is the difference betwen Microsoft for making
format.com and Dark Avenger for making his viruses? We should take

This is a new one on me.  It's easy to send messages to a screen to
upset someone.  The command rsh remotesys: echo "Huff & Puff" will
have the same effect as you described.

There are lots of Trojans, however your description does not match

Nick: Are you shilling for my stuff ? 8*). Seriously, when my DiskSecure
      made its appearance back in 1990 a P-table backup was built in for
      that very reason. (actually the recovery method then was triple
      redundant. Still is.)

      My FreeWare FixMBR has this function also "just in case" and would
      have cleared up this problem in under a minute without FDISK or
      FORMAT. (DS II would have done it automatically).

      removed the Michelangelo and took an entire 1+ Gig Novell partition
      along with it.

      To me the amazing thing is not that the PT's are not compared, it is
      that after nearly *three years* of bad examples they are *still* not
      being examined for reasonableness.

Subject: Re:Floppy Disk Virus? (PC)

In Virus-L V6 I132, Otto Stolz discusses the "Critical Error Handler Bug",
describing how dangerous swapping disks may be when confronted with the
Abort, Retry, Fail error message.  He suggests selecting "Abort" and
starting the writing action again.
   Unfortunately, this sometimes results in a larger "writing action"
than he intends.  Some programs which don't have any (or very good)
critical error handling code of their own will, on receiving the "Abort"
response, return directly to DOS; all data entered since the last
(successful) save will be lost.  Better, in my experience, is to choose
"Fail"; DOS will report a successful write to the calling program, which
then assumes the write actually happened.  It didn't, of course, but at
least one returns to the program.  Then swap disks and repeat the request
to write out the data to disk.

The way you are scanning for Msdos viruses is AOk.  Make sure
that the files are not in .Z, .Zip, .tar, .cpio formats or your
Msdos virus scanner will not correctly scan them.  Msdos systems
do not understand these Unix compression and compound file archive
formats. Additionally, you are only scanning for Msdos, not Mac,
Amiga, Unix or anything else.  If you are running Liken for Mac
emulation then you should do the same thing with a Mac.  Some
goverment sites use Amigas on their Unix networks.  Ditto for the
Amigas since the Unix box always ends up becoming the file server.

In addition, any scanner that does not have to deal with compound
files, psydo-disks, multi-binary enviroments with emulation,
viruses written in script with unknown white space and variable name
changes can always run fast.  It's take longer to do everything right.
I contend that a general virus scanner for the Unix system must do all
of these things and must scan every byte of every file.

Subject: Help with Chinese Fish (PC)

We have a PC whose partition table has been destroyed by the Chinese
Fish virus.  Can anyone suggest a way to repair the computer after the
virus has been cleaned?  I plan to use F-PROT to clean it but didn't
want to do it yet in case something else should be done first to try
and recover the data.  Or does cleaning the disk of the virus
automatically repair the data too?  Excuse my naivete--this is the
first virus I've personally run into, though I've been *checking* for
them for years!

I'd also like to know anything anyone can tell me about this
particular virus.  There is a vague message in Sector 9 of the first
cluster on the hard disk saying that "Fish will kill stone" or
somesuch.  We were wondering if this is a form of blackmail by the
author that he will unlock the virus and fix your disk if you pay him
ransom or something wild like that... do virus writers do such things?

How does FISH wreck your disk?  Is it triggered by date or what... it
seems to have spread quite a bit among our group and I'd like to know
whatever anyone can share.  We'd love to figure out how it got here.

Thanks...

I agree 100%. The ONLY way to test A-V software is with live specimens. Not
all A-V developers select the same signatures for the same virus.

there are two problems I see with Rosenthals premise.

1. The A-V developer that submits the most signatures will unfairly win the
test.

2. It is a very bad idea to release  virus signatures because the VX guys can
easily open the files and know what bytes of a virus to change in order for a
new variant to slip by a scanner undetected.

Hackers can find the signature for a virus by using a HEX editor, but if they
want 2,000 virus signatures, that is going to take a lot of work.

  Inoculator; the First Junkware Anti-viral Software.

We have just received a sample of a new anti-viral program from
China.  This is nothing very exciting, just another inoculator
like the one included in Central Point Anti-Virus.  When it
"noculates" a file it puts a header on the file which includes a
copy of the start of the file, and the length.  Then whenever you
run the file the header checks that the length of the file is
correct, and if not it restores the start of the file from the
saved copy, and truncates it to the correct length.

This technique has serious limitations.  The changes to the file
will upset programs which include internal verification
procedures, and will effectively hide existing viruses from
scanners.  The procedures to detect infection are rudimentary,
and will not detect stealth viruses, and the disinfection is
extremely simple minded, and will destroy files infected with
some viruses.

However the main difference between this virus and other
inoculators is that its author considered it so good that he
decided that you just had to have it, so he used a virus to
distribute it, to save you the bother of buying and installing
it.  By analogy with junk mail we have decided to call this class
of software (allegedly useful software distributed by a virus)
Junkware.

The virus is not intentionally destructive, but it will destroy
some programs and crash some systems.  It is normally invisible,
but if you run SCAN it displays the following message

              AntiVirus
        If your software has been
        inflected by other viruses,
        run your software, then the
        virus will be cleaned !
           THANK YOU!
                --Mr. MeiHua--

The virus uses some very devious techniques in an unsuccessful
attempt to conceal some of its tricks, and these cause a very
obvious loss of speed on older PCs.  Thus on an XT (we don't run
viruses on our good PCs!) it took 8 seconds, instead of the usual
2.5, for a simple program to run from a floppy, and Scan 5:02
minutes, instead of only 3:43, to check the floppy.  We did not
bother to check if the disinfection actually works.  I don't
think anyone will be asking us to review the program!

This, incidentally is not the first example of junkware (in this
restricted sense!).  This honour probably goes to a virus called
Cruncher, reported in Europe last year.  This includes a pirated
version of the file compression utility LZEXE, and when it
infects your PC it proceeds to compress all the files it infects.
It can actually increase the space on your hard disk appreciably;
if you don't mind the occasional crash and loss of data (not to
mention the curses of your friends when you pass it on to them).

We have provisionally called the new virus Inoculator.  We have
had no reports of it being found in Australia, or even in the
western world.  VET 7.44 will detect files infected with this,
and a number of other more boring viruses recently found
overseas.

Subject: Filler Virus (PC)

greets all,

we survived monkey, and some bastard reincarnation of stoned, and
form, i think.  now we've got filler, which is about as apetizing as a
tapeworm.

The symptoms that this virus exibit that make me think that it is a
version of FILLER are

"1) When you run a scan of the files, there are no infected
properties.  There are known versions of FILLER that will load
themselves into areas of the hard drive (the last sector I think) that
are inaccessible to DOS.  Therefore there are no infected files.
However, they alter the FAT to point to them so that they are not
lost.

2) When you reboot an machine that has tested positive for FILLER
using SCAN, it tests negative.  There is a known mutation of FILLER
that loads itself into memory (just beyond the 640k region) 10 minutes
after the machine has been booted up.  Therefore any scans on boot up
will not detect it.  The things I have been seeing are
        1) using SCAN/CLEAN - If you run SCAN, sometimes a computer
will say that it has the FILLER virus, etc.  However, sometimes the
virus will then disappear to future runs of SCAN or CLEAN.  CLEAN will
not remove it.  If the computer has been just booted up, SCAN will not
find it.
        2) using F-PROT - When you load F-PROT, it does an automatic
memory scan.  If the computer is infected, no matter how recently it
has been booted, it will detect something.  However the something is
rarely FILLER.  It usually finds either STONED or FALLING LETTERS
(CASCADE)."

It sounds like the cascade virus, which I believe is listed as

But I could be wrong, in either case any good scanner should
be able to clean it because cascade is rather old.

Yup. Another function call can even remove it from memory (unless it
is loaded as a device driver). CPS claim to have removed this security
hole in version 2.1 - I have not verified this, though.

Just disabling it won't do - the unencrypted scan strings will remain
in memory and overwriting the memory will crash the system. A better
solution is to remove it from memory and then wipe the memory occupied
by it, but even this is not good enough, because you can't remove it
from memory if it has been loaded as a device driver.

The best approach is the one Frisk posted - just warn the users of the
crap they are using and the possible consequences of it.

Speaking about CPAV... In a previous message, I promissed to test the
new version 2.1 (beta?) that was sent to me and which was supposed to
be "much better". Well, honestly, I tried - to test it, that is.

First, I was gullible enough to start it in a DOS box while reading my
e-mail under Windows (shame, shame, that guy's using Windoze <grin>).
When I told it to scan the disk containing my virus collection (about
4,200 subdirectories and 17,000 files), and after a lot of disk
muchning, it came up with the useful message "Not enough memory".
Fine. I have "only" 584 Kb free conventional memory in the DOS boxes
(plus 59 Kb free High memory, plus 228 Kb free XMS, plus 256 Kb free
EMS). Shame, shame.

OK, so I shut down all my windows and started the program from plain
DOS - loaded high, so that 622 Kb free conventional memory is
available. OK, it worked this time. Well - almost. It crashed on
exactly the same sample of Andryushka.3536 as version 2.0. The sample
is a naturally infected file - nothing corrupted. But even if it were
corrupted, I would expect the scanner either to find the virus or not
to - but not to crash. Especially having in mind that I supplied this
same sample to the CPS/CPAV people (personally to Eli Shapira) about a
month ago - and before I got any version 2.1 copies - and I got two of
them since. So much for the speed with which they fix such problems.

Unfortunately, in this particular example, DOS will "abort" the current
process, which is very probably your editor, and will kick you to the
prompt. Therefore, you are guaranteed to lose your work.

My suggestion? Don't use editors that don't have their own critical
error handlers.

This is one of the most popular commercial anti-virus product. Just
like CPAV, it has a nice user interface and it regularly wins it
"editor's choice" awards in the magazine reviews. From the anti-virus
point of view, however, it is almost as bad as CPAV. Well, to be
honest, it is difficult for something to be as bad as CPAV from the
anti-virus point of view... :-)

Version 1.0 of the product is outdated, discontinued, and in one of
its modes eats up your disk space with myriads of 77-byte files.
Version 2.0 has fixed this problem and was soon followed by 2.1. It is
bearable, but has a relatively low detection rate, has problems with
very polymorphic viruses like the MtE-based ones, and so on. The
latest version is 3.0, which is supposed to be much improved, because
it has merged the technology used in Certus' NOVI - after Symantec
aquired Certus. However, I have not seen a regular version 3.0 (only a
beta under development, which had its fair share of problems), so I
cannot comment on it - it is still too recent.

If that is version 2.1, you might be getting what you are paying for.
If you insist on NAV, better get version 3.0.

Yes. I have just not tested how reliable the detection is. One of our

replicants (the damn thing is not that easy to replicate correctly)
and I will probably be able to publish better test results in the

Hi,

I've read various postings relating to F-Prot version 2.09f. However, I
could not find it at oak.oakland.edu. Is oakland not a good place to

Maybe your copy of the definitions update file is corrupted somehow -
for instance, due to transmission error. Try the one from our ftp
site:

ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de:/pub/virus/progs/nav21upd.zip

I have obtained it directly from Symantec and have used it to update
version 2.1 of NAV without any problems.

I'd like to know more, as we have a pretty good Monkey epidemic going.
My machine was infected, and booting from a floppy is a _very_ rare event
for me.  (However, I did read the FAQ, which points out that
accidentally starting the machine with an infected "non-bootable" disk
in the drive -- a much LESS rare event -- can also infect the PC).

Still, I'd like to know -- can Monkey, a boot sector virus, infect in
any other way than by starting up with an infected floppy in the drive?

On the other hand, ".\dir.com" or "C:dir.com" will run the file

More to the point, while I can't find the original discussion, I
assume it has something to do with a malicious program creating a
"DIR.COM" in the hopes it'll be run in place of "DIR".  It wouldn't be
too tough for such a program to blit the text string "DIR" in
"COMMAND.COM" to some garbage string.  On the next bootup (or possibly
the next load of the non-resident COMMAND.COM overlay), your "DIR.COM"
would run just fine.
