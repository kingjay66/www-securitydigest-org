I see the point that you and others have made here, but your point that gun
magazines don't come with guns is not the final word.  

First, some of the "bad books" (presumably legal under the 1st amendment) show
you how to do crimes from readily available materials.  I have heard of the
Anarchist's Cookbook.  And the email mag that I referred to before tells you
how to kill someone with a potato!  Now, they didn't have to INCLUDE the
potato for that material to exceed standards of human decency.  Using your
argument, spreading the information on how to kill someone with a potato is
acceptable as long as they don't include the potato!  (Ie, it isn't "fully
functional".)

Second, by your definition even 40-Hex doesn't include "fully functional"
viruses because it doesn't include the computer. (No groans please, as this
could be a real point made to defend the 40-Hex people in court if it should
ever come to that.)

Third, PC's and guns and potatos are all readily available in this country, so
instructions on how to do bad things with each of these items should fall into
the same category.  The question is, which takes precedence, the first
amendment or human decency?  Indeed, would you choose between the first
amendment or national security???

Subject: sharing virus related info

Hi all there. I wanna point that I agree at 100% with the previous append of
Suzana, about Hex40 and info share. My point is: there are "bad Girls/Guys" and
there are "good Girls/Guys"; in my opinion, stated that is not so important to
question about the black that is white or so, but on the characteristics of
those two groups of people. I intentionally don't care about those "grey level"
people that we can found one time on our side, another on the opposite. Every-
body has the freedom of choice, in free countries. Let's state we count them as
"bad G/G", for make all a bit easy.
Now, let's suppose a new trick was discovered, enabling the construction of
some hellfire virus, able to nuke any PC. Most probably, the underground tam-
tam (Hex40,BBS,Books,Clubs etc.) will share that info and/or samples in a quite
little time. So, I think we can suppose a lot of "bad G/G" working on that; I
also think only few of them will be strong programmers, but almost all will
know something about ASM and so on. In such a scenario, I suppose isn't too
difficult that, with a lot of brains at work, at least one 'good' (I mean
strongly functional) idea spread out, and this will immediatly shared in the
"bad G/G" group. And so the first Hellfire Virus spreads...
On the other hand, if this virus or related code is discovered by one of us,the
"good G/G", it seems to me (by reading this Digest) it's quite probable that
the related info (code, structure, etc.) will be carefully keeped by the one
that first jump into, and at maximum shared with those few s/he well knows.
So, while the Bad Army has (can expect to have) a lot of people at work, the
Good Army can face that with only four or five persons. Don't misunderstand me,
I'm sure we have the best researchers/developers, but I think that there's a
lot of people on the good side that can also work about, and perhaps bring
some good hints. And that have also the right to know.
I'm really not so scared about the "bad G/G" that can be tuned, intercepting th
e info the "good G/G" are sharing between them; if they don't have them yet,
they will in a while; about info sharing theyr organisation seems to me better
than our. I only agree not to share executable samples, viruses 'ready to use'.
Those can be a danger, I admit. If someone gets a such-a-file, the virus has
great chance to spread. But code... a virus writer has no need of sources from
us, and other people... Do you know how much time it require to copy row after
row some seven-pages source virus code? Yeah, someone get the effort (life is a
GREAT risk), but I don't think they're the major part of whom will receive it.
And, anyway, share an Hex40 issue means only to show at Goods what Bads yet
have (no hint for them).

Subject: Viral "code"

People seem to think (as I have in the past) that somehow viral "code" is the
thing we must not publish.  Do these people think that a documented
description of the virus function is also wrong?  In fact, an accurate
description of a program is "functionally equivalent" to the program itself.
Indeed, an assembler source code program is just a "description" of the
program it represents.  And a high level language (or English itself) can take
indirection one level further, without loss of, or change in, functionality.

Certainly even an "innocent" forum such as VIRUS-L goes into extensive
detail (in English) of the functionality of viruses. Sure, you need
to be a good programmer to convert English to Assembler, but this is
something that they teach you in school. As I analyze myself here and
now, I think the inner reason I started reading VIRUS-L was to learn
more about the things viruses actually do, partly to enhance my
knowledge of DOS, and partly to learn things that I wasn't "supposed"
to know. Is it any surprise that the books that attract me are often
titled "Tricks, Tips and Traps?"

This forum certainly does not provide you with code for writing viruses.
That's great.  But what does it provide?  Lots and lots of information about
the things viruses do; the way they work; their functions.  Call it an "idea
well" or call it an "informal specification forum", it still contains many
English language functional descriptions that bad guys(/gals) could use.

In fact, if the moderator doesn't get mad at me (Ken, there may be a degree
of truth to the following but it's not the whole story of course) I would
propose that the FAQ which is available from this forum could be called
"An English Primer for Would-Be Virus Writers". (Again, Ken, I see a lot
of value to the FAQ, which is why I have contributed to it. For people who
can't read between the lines of my post, my theme remains the same: the
benefits of knowledge outweigh the risks. Of course there are exceptions
such as nuclear bomb technology but I don't see virus-related technical
information as fitting that category.)

Just in case it isn't obvious, my opinions are my own (the facts are
public domain. :-)

[Moderator's note: I have to admit that I never considered the FAQ to
be a primer to writing viruses.  Your point is well taken, however; it
is essential to know something about viruses in order to administer
effective countermeasures.  The intent of the FAQ was - and is - to
provide some of that basic knowledge to would-be virus _removers_.  If
that causes it to also provide some knowledge to the virus writers,
then so be it.  I think, however, that most (all?) virus writers
wouldn't find much new (to them) information in the FAQ.]

Is it? Maybe my mistake was in specifying the word "file", but I
thought you know enough about viruses to understand what I mean...
There are a couple of hundreds of viruses that infect only a SINGLE
executable on the attacked computer.

> >2) This file is an anti-virus program.

Elaborate, please. Do you consider it suspicious for somebody to use
an anti-virus program? Or do you consider it suspicious if the owner
of a LAN insists that all users are using the latest version of a
particular anti-virus program?

> >3) The modification consists of replacing the program with a newer copy.

> How do you know it is the better or correct one?

That's so obvious that I left it as an exercise to the reader.
Remember, it was the system administrator who put it there. It is
his/her right to decide whom to permit to log in to the server. The
policy might be "have the latest version of VShield installed" or
"Don't run MS Windows". It doesn't mean that VShield is "better" or
that Windows is "worse" - just such is the policy.

A little bit more tricky is the question how the program on the server
ensures that the program being replaced on the workstation is really
an older version of itself, but this is a technical quibble and can be
solved easily.

> >4) The virus infects your computer when you log to the LAN server.

What's so strange about it? Stoned infects only one thing - the MBR.
Yet, when it happens, we are saying that the computer is infected with
Stoned.

Of course, that's the point. Deliberately, intentionally, willfully,
etc. By a person who owns the system - by the supervisor on the server
and by the user on the workstation. The supervisor does the initial
installation and the user permits the update.

Please, read the definition of "blackmail". I don't have it handy, but
it says something about "with threats making unwaranted promises".
Here the situation is different - the user has the choice to accept
the update or not to log in. And if s/he accepts the update, s/he is
granted access - no unwaranted promises.

We've already been through all this a few times in the past. Please,
read the appropriate back issues. It all depends on how you define
"attach".

See below.

You are missing the point. I am trying to explain to everybody
(including you) what Dr. Cohen means when he is speaking about
"beneficial viruses". Those are programs that are beneficial and that
match his definition for a virus. They might not match -your-
definition for a virus, or the definition that most people use for the
term "virus", or whatever. It doesn't matter, because it is not you or
"most people" who are speaking about "beneficial viruses", it is Dr.
Cohen. So, it is more than natural that he will use his definition of
the term - especially having in mind that he was the first one to
define it. So, if you want to understand what Dr. Cohen means when
speaking about beneficial viruses, don't jump on him - instead try to
understand his definition of a virus and assume that he is using it
when speaking about beneficial viruses.

> How can you be sure something is a

Simple - you call "virus" everything that matches your definition for
this term.

It should also emphasize the main capability of the virus that makes
it different from other programs - merely its ability to spread. Its
optional side effects (damage, etc.) should left out of the
definition.

I have one here. It is actually Dr. Cohen's definition, with all
symbols explained and without the abbreviation shortcuts he usually
uses. It's hand-written and is one A4 sheet of formulae.
Unfortunately, I don't know TeX enough to translate it into
electronical form.

Supposing that virus writing is a criminal act would be wrong, because
it isn't, according to the legislation of most countries. Instead, the
definition should concentrate on causing (directly or indirectly)
unauthorized modifications of information stored in computers. It
doesn't need to deal with the term "virus" at all - the more general,
the better. It could very well include trojan horses, logic bombs,
spoofs, hacking, etc. It is all the same from the legal point of view
- - causing directly on indirectly unauthorized modifications to
computer information, and -this- is what should be a crime.

I do feel competent to judge the quality of the first two definitions
- - the technical ones.

It seems to me that there is a big risk here.  If I post a false
signature, but one that will register a hit on some popular piece
of software, and this signature accidently gets incorporated into
one or more anti-viral software packages, then some people are
going to get false-positives.  What a waste of time for everyone.
But, given the opportunity, I have no doubt that people will try
this ploy.  Even if the phoney signature is only used by individuals,
those individuals may be tricked for awhile to think they have a
virus when they don't.

I agree on the fact that if a virus encrypts the host program, it might not be 
possible to recover it (unless you keep a backup of some sort, and this is 
also the most generic method of all). But if the virus "damaged" the file so 
that only a key-part of it is encrypted (like HAIFA realy does) that poses a 
problem in *Specific* cleaning but non for grneric one (suppose the signature 
you keep on the file containes just the information missing).

By definition a method that may do its task whithout knowing the identity of 
the attacker should be called "generic". FDISK /MBR is the generic method to 
clean most MBR viruses, SYS.COM it a generic BOOT-SECTOR cleaner (even if 
MicroSoft did not intend to do it) etc...

The answer is still "it depends".

First, it depends on what version of NetWare you are using. It seems
to me that you are implying 3.11 and I don't have much experience with
it. If you are using anything below, and if you have not applied the
security patch from Novell, then it is possible for a virus to use the
mechanism of the KNOCK.EXE program to obtain supervisor privileges and
do with your files whatever it wishes. Note however that this trick
doesn't work under 3.11 and no such virus has been written yet anyway
- - it is just a possibility.

Second, what does "everyone" mean? A user with supervisor privileges
is obviously able to do anything with those files. In practice, this
means that if a virus succeeds to infect such a user, the virus will
be able to do anything with the protected files. So, it is important
not only what the protection settings of the protected files are, but
also can a virus infect a user with supervisor privileges? That is,
can such user execute something from a place where a regular user has
write privileges? (That is - is there a transitive information flow
from users with low security privileges to users with high security
privileges?)

Third, it is possible to use a variant of the PATH companion attack to
make the protected files "look" as infected, but such "infection"
doesn't spread between users and is not of serious concern anyway.

My analogy in this case is still a proper one - demanding from the
anti-virus researchers that they make the viruses in their collections
publicly available, just because some Joe Random wants to verify that
computer viruses exist and are able to do all kinds of things is just
like demanding NASA to take you in the Shuttle, in order to verify
that the Earth is round - in both cases there are much cheaper,
easier, more practical, etc. ways to do it. And a demand like that is
something that the concerned people (AV researchers or NASA) will just
not care about, regardless how much the other part is yelping.

See the FAQ about how to get the answer for your first question.
Regarding you second question - it lives on the boot sector of a
floppy and the MBR of the hard disk; not in the executable files. It
can infect an IBM PC compatible machine (regardless of the operating

the attempt to boot does not need to be successful - i.e., it can be a

Boot from a clean diskette and do a SYS C: to remove it from the hard
disk's boot sector. Removing it from the files is trickier - it
overwrites the EXE header and you need an anti-virus program to repair
the infected files. For instance, F-Prot 2.07 is able to disinfect
this virus correctly.

That information is a bit out-of-date. It was real, it was a hardware
bug (in the controller for monochrome monitors, not in the monitors
themselves), but those (buggy) controllers and not produced any more
since a long time.

You are right, a simple virus could cost a user or a company lots of
money. Even if the virus does NOTHING but spreads. Actually, even a
false positive (a non-virus) could cost a LOT of money...

This could be, but need not. General protection faults occur from time to time,
sometimes without an obvious reason. Sometimes you can fix this by correctly 
configuring Windows (e.g. if you try to print in a BANYAN VINES network, you'
ll get this one. You must insert NETSPOOL=YES at the entry [spooler] in WIN.
INI, then it works).

There are smaller ones (the smallest 30 bytes if I remember correctly), but 
these are all overwriting COM-infectors and non-windows specific.

no : a virus is only "stealth" if it is running. If you have booted from a 
clean disk, the virus did not run and therefore was "naked", not stealth.

 RK> describes that the dir-II virus crosslink files and directories I used

.. he killed them...

To remove a DIR-infection the only secure way is to copy all executables to 
files with non-executable extensions with THE VIRUS ACTIVE IN MEMORY ! This 
way the virus itself will "desinfect" the files, it will act as a "low-level-
cleaner" :-))

"COPY *.COM *.MOC"
"DEL *.COM"
"COPY *.EXE *.XEX"
"DEL *.EXE"

in every (sub and root) directory, on every exe and com-file (uses ATTRIB from 
DISK to remove any hidden and sys attributes, but write on a piece of paper, 
which files have been hidden /system/read-only to re-set these attributes at 
the end of the session), some programs may require these.

then reboot from a clean disk and (from now on we don't need the virus anymore)
type

"SYS C:"
"UNFORMAT /PARTN" - note : only valid, if you have run MIRROR /PARTN before 
the infection occured. *recommended* ! Very useful.
"REN *.MOC *.COM"
"REN *.XEX *.EXE"

in every directory.
reboot again from C:, your computer is clean.

Using CHKDSK /F on a DIR-infected disk without the virus in memory will 
DESTROY all infected files if you allow CHKDSK to "repair" anything.

Subject: TSR programs are too big (PC)

Moin,

there are several mails about too big scanners, but that's not
my problem. I have a problem with the size of the TSR-program which 
I use for security. 
I need at least! 480KB of base memory for one DOS program and
get it with some difficulties without my actual security program 
VSHIELD. The HMA and the UMB are filled with DOS, several 
drivers (Network, SCSI) and the EMS page. The PC is a 486 with 16MB memory. 

Is there a security TSR program, which can be loaded (partly) in the 
extended or expanded memory ? 
If not, is any developer planning to create such an option in his
program(s) ?

The "/lh" switch in VSHIELD allows only loading into the UMB 
and that doesn't work. So the program will be not loaded.

NAV update files are available *free* on Compuserve, on Symantec's BBS
at 408-973-9598 or 408-973-9834.  They may be purchased on a one-time
basis by people who do not have access to those things or any networks.
And they can be subscribed to for regular delivery for a fee.  (I'll just
say, call 1-800-343-4714 x756 for further information on the services
that cost money.)

Back to the *free* ways to get updates:  They are available free through
me by individual request.  They are available through the Virus Help Centre
(Sweden), ask mikael@vhc.se, even if *he* is a McAfee Agent.  They can be
available through anyone who wishes to redistribute.

Basically, NAV definition file updates are and can be freely distributed in
its present form (note lack of copyrights).

We don't support ftp access yet.  We may.  But that's under someone else's
jurisdiction and has nothing to do with wanting to charge for the updates
since I already send out updates to anyone who asks.  [Updates are only
available for 2.1.]

Yes, it was possible to destroy an original IBM Monochrome monitor
through software activity.  But not too many of them around any more.
(All been destroyed?  :-)  )  But that was only the IBM Monochrome
monitor and some "really good" clones.  As soon as this was discovered,
manufacturers realized the circumstances and made new ones that would
not have that problem.  (Sorry, I'm not a hardware guy.)

The concept of destroying hardware with software is a possibility.
There are many concepts that can be applied.  But that's not the only
way to assess "Viruses which cost $$$".  Even though mainframes have
circuit breakers when they get too hot, if you can turn off the fan
that would result in a subsequent activation of the circuit breaker,
you've caused the machine to go down.  Downtime costs $$$.  So,
simply crashing the machine costs $$$.

So, whereas the possibility to destroy hardware through software might
be real, there's really no need.  You cause enough loss just by getting
a virus onto the system.

FP-208.ZIP      F-PROT v2.08: Virus detection/removal software

Version 2.08 - major changes:

   The identification and disinfection information has now been moved to
   the file SIGN.DEF, which reduced the memory requirements considerably,
   by 50K or so.

Version 2.08 - the following problems were found and corrected.
   A few minor false positives were corrected:

        "Possibly a new variant of ARCV" in a version of SPINRITE.COM
        "TPE" in a few non-executable files.

   The disinfection of the following viruses was corrected, but previously
   F-PROT was not able to clean all infected files correctly: Tula-419,
   Prudents, Tiny.198, Macedonia, Gotcha.C, Vbasic.B, Vbasic.C

   The VIRSTOP program could not be run after the APPEND program was
   loaded.  Fixed now.

   Some problems with /WARM and /COPY have been fixed.

Version 2.08 - new viruses:

   The following 14 new viruses can now be detected but not removed,
   only deleted.  This is because they overwrite infected files, or
   damage them irreversibly.

The Results:

First, a note... keep in mind that not everyone answered all the questions,
and in several cases, I had to throw out vague or confusing answers (only
once or twice, however).  Also, keep in mind that I know very little about
Mac and Atari viruses/scanners, so forgive me if I mistype any names...

32 people responded, 2 of which used Atari ST's, and 6 of which used Macs.
Note that some people used more than one type of computer (ie, they 
responded with what they use for their Mac and their PC).

On PC's, F-Prot was the most used scanner... 22 people used it.  8 people
used McAfee products (Scan, etc).

On Macs, Disinfectant was used by 5 people, SAM by 1 person.

On Atari, Virendetektor was used by 1 person.

Of those polled, 8 have never been infected by a virus, 14 had been infected
once, 2 had been infected twice, 1 person had been infected three times, 1
person infected four times, 2 people infected 5 times, and two people
infected 7 times (and several that responed were unsure, ie 'A dozen or
so times').

Of Dos viruses, 7 of the infections were from Stoned, 6 were by Jerusalem,
3 were by Form, and 2 were by Not-int, Cascade, Yankee Doodle, 
Michaelangelo, and Brain.  About a dozen other viruses infected only one 
person, too many to list here.

Of Mac viruses, 3 infections were by nVIR A, and 1 infection by nVIR B,
WDEF and MDEF.

Here is how the virus danger was rated by those polled:
