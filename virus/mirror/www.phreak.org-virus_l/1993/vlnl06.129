The question is a bit too general. Do you need to protect Unix
machines from Unix viruses or do you want to detect PC viruses on a
Unix file server?

The above technique suggests that you want to protect from PC viruses.
In this case yes, the technique does make sense. There are very few
Unix-based scanners for PC viruses and they are not as good as the
existing PC-based scanners for PC viruses.

The above sentence suggests the opposite - that you are trying to
protect from Unix viruses. Well, there are not many of them - I have
seen only 3-4, only one of which has been reported in the wild. And
none of the existing PC viruses is able to infect Unix executables.

> A side question: How does a Virus on Unix do its damage?

What virus on Unix? A PC virus on Unix? Well, it doesn't do any
damage, because it doesn't run - usually it can be only stored on a
Unix machine that acts as a file server for a network of PCs. One
exception is if you have a PC emulator on Unix - but then the virus
can run and cause damage only within the emulated environment - and
even then there are some restrictions.

Or do you mean a Unix virus running on Unix? Well, such virus can do
anything that a normal program can - delete files if they are
writable, steal passwords, if they are readable, infecting other
files, if they are writable, and so on.

Bert, your query is inconsistent.  You request a mechanism that
is both "common" and "bullet proof."  That is an over constrained
problem.  There are no solutions in any real domain that are both
common and bullet proof.

Like a physician who does not prescribe for a patient that he has
never seen, I do not prescribe for environments and applications
that I do not fully understand.  (Niether do I give to one client
for free what I charge other clients for.)  Honest people will
respond to your question, and, taken collectively, they will
inform you, but all of that information will not _solve_ your
problem.

That having been said, an effective, though perhaps not efficient,
solution to your problem is to maintain rigorous separation between
PC data (of any type or class) that is merely intended to be stored
on your HP/UX and _programs_ that are intended to be executed there.
(I suspect that you will not find that answer any more "real world"
than I find your question.)

Sorry, but the above is IMPOSSIBLE. The closest thing to the situation
that you describe is if after accessing a floppy infected with a boot
sector virus you run a scanner and it reports a virus in memory (NOT
on the hard disk). This is just a mistake of the scanner and is called
"ghost positive" (see the FAQ) - and of course, there is no any virus
on your hard disk.

First, the latest version of F-Prot is 2.09f - available from our ftp

This virus doesn't cause such effects. Actually, it carries no
payload. It could cause damage unintentionally, but infecting some EXE
files with internal overlay structure - just like Jerusalem can.

The virus has been distributed initially in source on the virus
exchange BBSes. Then it has been released in the wild, and nowadays we
have several reports of infections by this virus. Speaking of the
damage that the VX BBSes cause...

The virus is a polymorphic resident EXE and COM fast infector with
unusually large amount of do-nothing instructions in the decryptor.
Keeps itself encrypted even in memory, which makes it a bit difficult
to detect it there. Can be detected with a set of wildcard scan
strings and a heuristic (to eliminate the false positives), but this
is not for amateurs; you should better use a reliable scanner.

The "Are you there?" call that the virus uses to determine its
presence in memory is INT 21h/AH=0F9h - if it gets AX=0AC0Ah, it
decides that it is already there and doesn't install itself in memory.
Adds 100 to the year of the date of last update of the infected files.
Doesn't infect COMMAND.COM (I think). Doesn't infect files smaller
than 1024 bytes. The type of the infected files (COM/EXE) is
determined by the "magic number" in the EXE header - but the virus
only checks for 'MZ', not for 'ZM'.

The virus removes the immunization modules appended to the files by
CPAV. Also removes the data that SCAN /AV (or /AG, not sure) adds to
the files.

The virus does not infect such files. It is almost certainly a false
positive. I encourage you to inform the author of F-Prot and to send
him the files that cause the false positive.

BTW, while writing this article, I noticed that SCAN 108 does NOT
detect this virus reliably! Users shouldn't rely on it to detect all
infected files and McAfee Ass. should look into the question.

Also, while taling about false negatives, it has been brought to my
attention that FindVirus 6.34 from Dr. Solomon's Anti-Virus ToolKit
does not detect reliably Tremor - yet another polymorphic virus which
is in the wild.

Correct. In the DOS boot sector of the active partition.

Indeed, this is, in practice, the source of all boot/master boot
sector infections. The only exception is a multi-partite virus or a
dropper.

Version 102 is pretty old; you should upgrade to 108, which is the
current one. I don't recall when CLEAN began to remove the Form virus
correctly. It might be also that you have some variant, but unlikely.

When CLEAN fails to remove a boot or a master boot virus, it is always
worthwhile to tell it to remove the [GenB] or [GenP] "virus"
respectively. This activates its generic algorithm for boot sector
virus removal and in many cases succeeds - although the algorithm is
by no means fool-proof and sometimes can take a looot of time.

The answer is: NO. FDISK/MBR rewrites the master boot record (MBR),
while the Form virus resides in the DOS boot sector (DBS). The correct
tool to use in this instance is SYS.

> Or do I have the definitions of the
> Master Boot Record and the boot sector mixed up?

It seems that you know the difference (or at least that there is one),
but have confused what exactly the Form virus infects. It infects the
DBS, not the MBR.

You shouldn't use the word "identify" together with McAfee's VIRUSCAN,
unless preceded by the word "doesn't". :-) SCAN doesn't identify
anything. It can just detect scan strings (and some classes of
decryptors, using algorithmic approach) in files.

As I have said several times here - SCAN is essentially useless for
virus identification. It doesn't use consistent virus names, the names
often change from version to version, not all of them are listed in
the documentation, many names listed in the documentation are never
reported, some names listed in the documentation are misspelled, often
two closely related virus variants are reported with two completely
different names, and often two completely different viruses are
reported with one and the same name. Infections by some viruses are
reported with two different names, even if only one virus is present.
Sometimes one and the same virus is reported under different names in
COM and EXE files.

SCAN is relatively good only in one thing - to decide whether some
object (file or boot sector) is infected or not. In order to determine
with what exactly it is infected, you should use another program that
does this job better.

First, the name is F-Prot. Second, which version did you use? Third,
there is no such thing as "the stoned virus" - there are dosens of
variants and F-Prot usually identifies them quite exactly. What
exactly did the program report? Maybe it has been "New or modfied
variant of Stoned" or "Possibly a new variant of Stoned"? In this
case, it is what the program says - a new virus variant (member of the
Stoned family of viruses), which is unknown to the program - that's
why it refuses to remove it.

In most cases booting from an uninfected write-protected DOS 5.0 (or
higher) system diskette and executing FDISK/MBR will remove a master
boot sector infector like the Stoned variants.

I see the Form virus atleast once a week. The easiest way to get rid of it
is to boot off of a clean floppy and SYS the HD.  (Make sure to use the same

PKLite files MUST be able to be decompressed no matter what kind of
compression they use-- otherwise, how could the CPU understand the
executable code?  The trick is that *PKLite* is unable to uncompress
files compressed with extra compression.  There are third-party programs
that will uncompress even these files.  F-prot and SCAN uncompress the
file into memory and then scan the uncompressed version.

I believe it is a variant of the "Surviv" family.  A resident .COM file
infector, reported to play music under the right circumstances.  Most common
antivirus utilities should disinfect it, though you would be much better off
to delete any infected software and restore it from either the original disks
or uninfected backups.

Just wanted to add a quick plug here.  Using frisk's VIRSTOP with the
/BOOT switch makes this much more effective.  After checking all the disks
you can find, just add VIRSTOP /BOOT to the startup of the computer and
verify that it works with F-TEST.  This will help prevent reinfection since
VIRSTOP will pop up a message when the disk gets accessed.

It should be noted that I have seen a very few problems with this switch.
Under Windows, or other programs that interpret the critical error handler
in strange ways, the warning message may cause the system to hang.  Usually
this is a sign that the disk was infected and hopefully the person using the
computer will have the good sense to remove the disk before rebooting...  In
any case the user should be notified that if the system hangs during floppy
access, the disk should be set aside for scanning.

BTW,  I don't work for frisk, even if I sound like it sometimes... :)  Just
a VERY satisfied customer.

Correct. FDISK/MBR would only work on viruses that hide in the partition
table. This includes Stoned, Michelangelo, etc.

However; a SYS C: may get rid of FORM. However; Since Form is a resident
virus, users should cold boot from a bootable diskette before trying this. I

The problem with many bait files is that the viruses don't like them :-)
Many viruses will infect practically every executable file...but there
are viruses that will only infect thiles that contain large block of 0-bytes,
start with a JMP instruction, are biggert (or smaller) than a particular
number of bytes, or meet some other criteria, so there is no guarantee that
any particular goat file will get infected if you get a virus.

Even if it does get infected, so what ?  If the virus is a stealth virus,
the goat file will "look" the same as before infection.

a)When it finally activates (at 30 minute clock tick) a black window
appears on the lower left corner of the screen
 b)the first instruction(from debug ip=100) is jmp 195 which is followed
by the string "sUMsDos".which i suppose refers to the author in some way.
anyway in the interest of brevity,the other virus was on an exe program
that quickly moved my directory from sector 5 to 3 and changed my boot
sector to constantly reboot itself(unendingly) with a beep and the
message "HeHe your computer is now hooked..."
I am very interested in knowing where these things come from and how I
may be of help.I am hoping that maybe I have given some information that
you can use.
please send me mail if you have questions.
and also is there anywhere that i can learn more about viruses?
I have limited time on a school bbs echo,here so i will not be able to
send a great deal of mail to and fro.
but i am a new programmer,2 years actually but mostly tinkering until
recently,and find the line of study you folks(?) pursue very interesting
and challenging.
also if you need me to send you the viruses that i have isolated please
let me know and i will do so.they are no longer attached to files and are
stand alone.the sUMsDos virus in particular is exactly 1808 byte
long(710)
anyway must go please write back

 I just wanted to let Frans know that TBAV605 is flagging a copy
of Timeset 6.0 as "Dropper of Bad_Taste"..  I'm used to TBAV
yelling that Timeset is suspicious, but this new version of TBAV
is actually saying it's a virus.  Timeset is packed using
ICE v1.0 acording to UNP v3.11 if that helps any..

i have a problem with my hard disk, it generates errors
such as 'sector not found' and 'file allocation table bad'.
when i run chkdsk it reports a lot of lost clusters.

also my monitor is flashing in a weird way.

a friend of mine suggested it could be a virus.

also i examined the boot sector with a program called
norton utilities and i found a string 'IBM 20.0' in it
what does this mean?

if anyone can help me pls leave a message.

Subject: A few questions... (PC)

   I was just wondering - If I use 4 anti-virus TSRs (PCRX, Virstop, VShield,
and the TBAV one), will they conflict with eachother, or will it work out?
   Also, after D/Ling the Faerie virus, I renamed it to .CO!, then scanned it
with SCAN.EXE. Then I fired up F-Prot to see what it would say, and it said
that Faerie was in memory! The only three things I had done after downloading
the virus was - PKUNZIPped it, renamed it from .COM to CO!, and scanned it
with SCAN.EXE. Why did F-Prot find it in memory? I rebooted it, and everything
seems fine now...

Subject: More troble with F-prot 2.09d and FORM (PC)

Well, the FORM virus came back to our site on a buch of computers that
were booting from the a: drive.  I booted off of a clean diskette and
disinfected the computers with f-prot.  On 2 of the four infected
computers, one is a zenith z386-20 and the other a compuadd 325,
f-prot disinfected the boot sector, but reported errors when opening
all of the files on the hard drive.  I exited f-prot and found that
I could see all of the files on the hard drive, copy and delete files
on the hard drive, run norton 7.0 disk doctor on the hard drive,
all without any problem.  I rebooted the computer using the hard
drive and found that f-prot would not report errors any more and the
file system appeared intact.  I booted from my write protected floppy
disk again and every thing seemed hunky-dory except for f-prot which
still could not read the files on the hard drive when it would scan the
computer.

????

At this point I decided to stop playing around and I backed up the
computer, repartitioned the hard drive and restored the data.  F-prot
still could not open the files on the hard drive if and only if I
booted from my clean disk.

Can anyone help me with this one?

p.s. I'm using MS-DOS 5.0.

I saw a post about LAN oriented software to protect against
viruses.  Did anybody save that? If so, could you send it to me?
If not, what is the best thing to run on a LAN?

Could you please provide more details about this. What tests did you
run to verify that this actually happened and not a reboot from an
infected floppy, or a previously infected machine which was noticed
at the particular time?

I cannot see why WP would read, much less, load and execute the floppy
disk boot sector when trying to read a file on the floppy. Please
enlighten me.

It is most likely that this is NOT a virus at all..
What the person would have done it simply pipe the animation to his/her
plan file so each time the person if fingured, it shows the animation.

There is a very short video called Bambi meets Godzilla in which Bambi is
munching on some grass while some Disney-type sweet music is playing.
Godzilla's giant foot suddenly comes out of the top of the screen and stomps
him into the ground.  That's all there was to it.  It's pretty old now.
It's probably the same one since the video was only about a minute long.

Looking  for an FTP site or BBS  which carries the REPORT / STUDY  on
Virus proofing NOVELL NETWORKS.
There also was a report, which pointed out the weaknesses of NOVELL
networks to virus infections.

Any information would be appreciated
