another 'small fact' worth raising:  

virus exchange sites exist -everywhere-.  academic sites, .mil sites,
.gov sites         lots of places.

it is disturbing to see a good source of information (i.e. an
information resource ) maligned in the manner fidonet is often maligned.

i personally have a fidonet bbs. sure, bad guys make use of the info
passed thru the fido network..but they make use of the information
passed thru the internet in -much greater degree-. if someone is going
to call Fidonet a 'forum used by bad guys', then they should at least
be reminded of the virus exchange sites located on some of the same
networks as the CERT teams in some cases. (Ken, you know what i'm
talking about here, i think).

it takes work to keep that sort of pestilence in control. we don't need
to kill the good info resources to stop the 'bad guys'. 

lets encourage people to make use of the many good information resources
that are available to help them learn about how to prevent viruses and
make 'compurity' ((c) 1992, 1993 sara gordon) a reality. we can't do that
if we are saying system x,y,z is bad cause it has some loud mouthed technopathic
idiots making fools of themselves from time to time, now can we? :)

Subject: Obtaining info on virus's ?

I would like to update my knowledge and understanding of how different types 
of virus (in general) are implemented.  I can see why this type of 
information might be restricted, is there any documentation I should read?
E-mail responses preferred.
Thanks, Andrew

Subject: Re: Latest list of viruses

The humorous viruses listed in the previous article first appeared
in PC Computing magazine.  It started with Mike Edelhart's August 1992
column where he roasted politicians with viruses named after them and
encouraged his readers to send in virus descriptions.  Many of the
responses were listed in the "Letters" section of PC Computing in
the November 1992 issue.

This leads to the question, is it legal to re-distribute these over
Usenet or would it be OK anyway since they were only letters and not
(as far as I know) copyrighted articles?  Would it be illegal to 
distribute Mike's original article over the Usenet but not the
subsequent letters?

[Moderator's note: I was not aware that the list was published in a
magazine; had I known, I would have contacted the magazine and asked
for permission to re-print, as I've done in the past.]

Subject: Booting password (PC)

Hi All,

A DTK 386SX in our lab was messed around (or virus infected).  It would not
boot, actually after the memory is checked.  It asks for booting password.
Normally we could activate the setup program (hold down esc key while
booting up) and change the password and we will be all set.  This time it
would not go to system setup utilities at all.  The screen will say that the
setup has been invoked but still asking for booting password!

I have disconnected the system battery hoping the CMOS setup would be gone
and trigger the setup routine when I boot it the next day.  The problem
still persist!  I have tried adding memory, disconecting drives (HD and FD)
and could not get it to run system setup at all!

Anyone has any idea what is going on?  Virus?

Thank you very much in advance for any help or info.

Hi,

Yesterday one of our machines contracted the Genb virus at boot up.  When I
cleaned it off it said that is was the Form virus.  I suppose one is a
variant of the other.  I have not been able to find any information on
either of these viruses and what they do, or how dangerous they are.

Thanks for your information.

Elizabeth writes about his problem.
All I can say is my experience: when I load bootsafe and vsafe or vwatch of
cpav in memory at startup, then F-prot find a BSV(boot sector virus). This
is due to the code of the antivirus. I think it is a false positive(I hope).
You can ask to frisk@complex.is to get two files: get_mbr.exe and
put_mbr.exe, so in the future you'll replace what is no good.
Try not to load the tsr antivirus, THEN scan the disk with F-prot.
Good luck. Let me know about the results.

Subject: New viruses warning (PC)

Hi everybody, I'm writing from Mexico and I have just got some new viruses from
 a friend in USA. In Mexico those viruses are not known at all but I don't know
 if they are in the wild in USA. Their names are Susan 1 and FoneSex.

   The Susan 1 virus is a resident overwriting virus. When an infected file is
run it gets into memory and can be seen with command 'MEM /P' as follows:
                            .
                            .
                            .
             012280         chess       000340    Program
                            .
                            .
                            .
It's easily detected because all infected programs when are executed present th
e message "bad command or file name" and terminate.
  This virus only infects the first .EXE in a subdirectory when a PLAIN dir com
mand is given. If you give a dir command with ANY parameter it would not activa
te the virus. After 15 infections the virus will errase all files in the curren
t directory with the next plain DIR command.
  You can check for this virus with the following signature:
             "C91FCD21B43ECD21C3505256571E068C"

The FoneSex virus is also an overwriting virus and seems to be nonresident, it'
s efficient len is 688 bytes and when you run an infected file it will infect a
ll .COM and .EXE files in the current directory and in \dos directory. It infec
ts COMMAND.COM. All infected files will only pressent the message "Out of Memor
y" and will terminate. If you have a modem the virus will dial sex numbers. I h
ave an Intel SatisFAXion modem and the virus didn't worked with it. I suppose
it will only work with more standard modems because it uses an OUT instructiion
 to dial.
You can check for the signature "EB079000B43BCD21C3E89B00E89F00".

   If you have any questions please write me.

What you are trying to create has been on the market for about 3 years.  The
product is called VFind.  VFind version 3R2 info sheet states the following:

Scans for Unix, MSDOS, Macintosh and Amiga viruses on your NFS network, servers
,
clients or stand alone systems, in one pass.

Can prevent infection of your site by scanning tapes, diskettes and other media
for viruses prior to usage.  Using the Unix "dd" command, VFind can read "tar",
"cpio", "dump" and all other tape or disk formats.

Does not require the virus to be active to be located.  It can locate dormant
viruses by using known scan keys and generic models.

VFind includes the CVDL generic pattern matching language with programmable
case sensitivity, forward proximity scanning, boolean operations and large
model capacity.

It locates "migrating" company classified or sensitive information such as
payroll, R&D documents and databases while it scans for viruses.  Forward
proximity scanning allows search of most compressed data formats with high
accuracy.

VFind can be run after business hours or any other time desired.  VFind is
"cron" ready for automatic start-up.  It can scan on-line disks prior, 
during or after nightly backup.

It also has a X11 GUI interface.  A single user copy sells for $300 US.

Definitely.  In fact, some of my Mac using friends think this type of virus

I have to disagree with that.

AmigaDos:  Possible under versions prior to 2.0, as the disk validator is

Ok, in fact I load first smartdrv.exe, then hyper386.exe.
Are you sure Windows works with DR-DOS 6.0, SuperStor, and HYperDisk 4.32?
And should I re-format my HD? (I still have all backups)

Subject: Zenith Hard Disk Boot (PC)

Our computer lab seems to be under constant virus attack,
especially from boot sector viruses.  We have Zenith 386's and
they allow through the setup procedure accessible by Ctrl/Alt/Ins
to make the system boot from the hard disk.  I tried it and it
made no difference then what was in the A drive (empty,
unformatted, formatted no system, etc.).  The startup obviously
did check the drives, but I don't think the boot sector is being
used.

Will changing the setup to boot from the hard disk stop boot
sector infections?  (Of course it could be changed, but it might
significantly slow down the spread if it works.)

WARNING:  MSAV CANNOT DETECT OR REMOVE SOME 1575/1591 VARIANTS. 

This is the virus I have most recently (read - last 2 months) had infections
with and reported in this forum.  I placed a file infected with this virus on
a machine with DOS 6.0 and scanned.  NO VIRUS FOUND.  Loaded VSAFE.  Tried to
copy the infected file, and VSAFE identified the virus as the '1591 virus',
and instructed me to use MSAV to remove the infection.  But MSAV doesn't know
about the virus!  THE MSAV AND THE VSAFE PROGRAMS ARE OUT OF SYNCH.  THIS
POINTS TO A POTENTIAL MAJOR FLAW WITH MSAV/VSAFE.  

At least MS promises upgrades to the detection portion from their bulletin
board.  They *DO NOT* explicitly promise these to be free.  No charges are
mentioned, but you *MUST* acquire a userid on their bulletin board to obtain
the files.  *NO PERMISSION* to share the signature files is explicitly
granted.

The *SPECIAL OFFER* price for MSAV *DISINFECTORS*  is $9.95 each.  No mention
is made of the 'regular' price after the special offer expires.  IT STATES
!!!!!_EXPLICITLY_!!!!! THAT THE FIRST UPDATE WILL SHIP ---->NOW<---- and that
the next will follow in 3-4 months.  Implication:  Microsoft KNOWS that the
MSAV product included with DOS 6.0 is insufficient and wants an extra $9.95
*NOW* to make it right.  IMHO, that is poor buisness practices, espcecially
where something as series as anti-virus software is concerned.

Personally, I think Frisk and McAfee can rest assured.  I, for one, CANNOT
take this offering from Microsoft seriously, and will reccomend other
anti-virus solutions to my network users and clients.

Subject: April Viruses? (PC)

Does anyone have, or know where I can find, a listing of viruses that
trigger in April?  And the other months?  I remember someone posting the
list of March viruses, and it would be nice to have the rest of the months
layed out as well....

Cheers,
John
