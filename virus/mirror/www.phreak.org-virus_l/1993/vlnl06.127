Hi,

Does anyone know groups or individuals who study / follow virus and hacker
activities in Asia / Pacific, whether they are in government, industry, or
academia?  I am particularly interested in groups / individuals in Australia,
Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea.

Thank you very much for your help.

Please respond by emailing me at this account.

P.S.:  If you have responded previously, I would appreciate it if you can

As a vendor of RAID-Ready Disk Enclosures, we get questions like this
all the time.  The simple fact is, that RAID technology subsystems
behave differently than regular disk with respect to viruses in only
one way - the virus can infect the array even if one drive in a rank
is down!  In that sense, you have a "Highly Available, Fault Tolerant
Virus (tm)".

The fault tolerance in a RAID array only protects you from hardware
failure; software errors that corrupt data, whether on purpose or
by accident, still corrupt the same way.  Thus, buying RAID does not
impact one way or the other on the virus issue.

Exception: if you have a software based RAID system, such as CorelRAID,
Integra, Chantal or whatever, some viruses may behave in strange and
unpredictable ways, much as if the infection was taking place on a
Stacker partition.

In V-L #124, Bert K. Mok asked:

Mainly by wasting the time, paper, and electrons of the people who
speculate about UNIX viruses.  UNIX is not exactly a fertile field
for virus propagation (no vector for propagation beyond the local
environment).  In V-L #115 Klaus Brunnstein mentioned "VMAGIC" as
a UNIX virus, but I haven't heard of any raging infections.

If you step beyond "virus" to "malicious software", hoo-boy has the
INTERNET got a WORM for you!  (It's nearly the fifth anniversary of
THOSE THREE DAYS in November 1988, folks!)  The method of damage then
was a "BLIVET ATTACK" (denial of service via overuse of a resource).

McAfee's SCAN/CLEAN has an OS/2 version. The programs can be obtained
from their ftp site (mcafee.com), directory /pub/antivirus. The names
of the archives are oscn108.zip and ocln108.zip.

Dr. Solomon's Anti-Virus ToolKit also has an OS/2 version, but this is
a commercial product. The same goes for IBM Antivirus/2 and Sophos
Sweep for OS/2. All the three are rather good, although IBM's product
uses the best the capabilities of OS/2, the Sophos product cannot
disinfect, and the AVTK has probably the best detection/disinfection
rate.

It's a pretty lame resident COM infector, which doesn't infect
COMMAND.COM, I think.

No, the Zobie virus has nothing to do with OS/2 - at least not the
version that I have.

Subject: New Variant of Stoned (PC)

  A friend of mine has a virus which is detected by f-prot 2.09d as

             New Variant of Stoned

On a floppy this was removed by sys a:.
Naively I thought that this could be removed from the harddisk by
sys c: and maybe fdisk /mbr (after booting from a clean floppy).

When booting from a clean floppy there is no harddisk
(typing "c:" gives "invalid drive"). However, when booting from an
infected floppy, the harddisk is present as normal.

How is this possible? And what is the best way to proceed?

Thanks, Jurgen

Subject: ULTIMATUM-infection - fact or fiction?? (PC)

One of my users recently got around to scanning his PC with F-PROT
2.09, and discovered that it found the above mentioned virus in all
drivers purchased with a special purpose card.  The name of the
infected file was given as SGPVOL.EXE!  The supplier of the driver has
been informed - but have not heard of any problems with the software
that has been on the market for several months (>6).

As they have installed it abroad as part of a bi-lateral project
(>10 PC's) is also the cause of some concern!
But in 6 months it does not seem to have infected other files or
in other ways made an impact on the rest of the world!!

Payload ??
- - the user is a bit worried because of the name!!??!!

Questions :
a)  What does that virus do?
    We have not been able to find any further information about it !

b)  Could it be a false positive?

To substantiate b) :

    Though F-prot 2.09 does find it (Scanner as well as heuristics),
    neither 2.09d, nor a later version (The Professional) report the file as
    infected.

    TPAV - does find it (also as ULTIMATUM), but cannot disinfect it and
    ends up suggesting that it might not be an infection at all!

    Solomons Virus toolkit (6.52) does not find it!!

    Naturally - the MSAV package comming with DOS does not find it, but
    that adds nothing to the general picture!

    Anybody with a bright idea - or some relevant info!

Regards,

J Olsen

Subject: Floopy Disk Virus? (PC)

  Need some advice about possible virus on floppy disks.  My floppy
disk works fine but when i chand to another diskette, the fat of the
first is overlaid on the second. Normally this would indicate to me a
cache problem or controler problem, but the same thing happend to a
relatives computer 100 mi away, same day and she has no cache
installed. I exchange progs with her frequently.
  More specific example: read directory of a: placed second disk in a:
did directory and poof! fat destroyed (looked at through norton
utilities).

  Any help would be appreciated, I see new scanv108 is posted will
retrieve this to see what it will turn up.

Subject: PCBB/Frodo? (PC)

Hi,

Some weird things go no here. i checked my two PC's with F-Prot 209D
and McAfee Scan 108, and found(allmost ) no virusses.  One diskette of
onne of our staff had Frodo on it.. Starnge enough since last week, my
XL and Winwxord are screwed up. (Info F-prot: Fordo activates on sept.
22 and triers toput a trojan horse.)  When importing the .ini files of
thoseprogramms into notpad and saving again (with overwrite, without
chaning) the problem was solved.

However, I found suspect files with f-prot (heuristic) namely:
edit.com, more.com, dosver.com (plot50 file).
Size of edit and more are resp 1241 and 3400, compared to the files on
other pc's (451 and 2600). They are bigger and apparently completely
different, allthough all PC's contain dos 5.00.

WHen running f-prot from under windows, He stops telling me a PCBB virus
is in the memory. This accurs not when running f-prot under dos.

Any idea if this is a new virus, or a frodo mutant?

For the ones interested, I can send a uuencoded edit.com .

I have encountered a virus on my system. With a virus scanner, I learned that
it's called TIMID and that it comes from a little black book. And I know that
it infects COM files.

I would like to know two things:

1) What exactly does it do. (I'm in Computer Science so I don't mind the
technical explanations...!)
2) How do you trace the execution of a virus? ...
    Debug? Codeview? ...

Subject: Satan Bug Virus (PC)

Apparently some yo-yo was running around D.C. panicing people about the
Satan Bug (SBUG or Sat-Bug) virus. The name comes from a non-displayed
ASCII string in the Virus.

Having taken a quick look at the thingie, can make some comments.

1) Virus is very obvious in memory - takes over 9k from the top of
   memory (see the FAQ) and causes a BIOS/DOS memory mismatch. My
   CHKMEM (FreeWare in FixUtil5) will flag immediately without knowing
   anything about the PC.

2) The worst aspect is the complex polymorphic encryption used. While it
   is very easy to spot (files grow by 3-5k and no "stealth" is used) it
   is rather difficult to remove since the oringinal size is lost and the
   real opening bytes are now encrypted).

3) It is a "fast infector" - will infect any .EXE or .COM appearing file
   opened so finding one or two no-executable files flagged as infected
   without any .COM or .EXE and 640k of memory available would warrant
   a "second opinion". F-Prot v209d and SCAN v108 both will detect the
   infection.

4) Protection can be had simply by specifying the COMSPEC in lower case.
   The virus will not become resident/spread unless certain elaberate
   (but typical DOS default) criteria are met.

5) The virus specifically tries to remove the validation code appended
   to executables by certain anti-viral products (IMHO not a good idea
   anyway).

					Hope this helps,

						Padgett

Subject: Possible new variant of AntiEXE (PC)

Hello.

I was wondering if anyone has ran across a virus that F-Prot 2.09d marks
as a possible new variant of AntiEXE.

This virus resides in the Master Boot Record.  On one computer that was
infected, it deleted the primary DOS partition and installed 4 non-DOS
partitions.  On several floppies, it has "unformatted" the disk, causing a
general failure.

For disinfection, I have tried formatting the hard drive.  Still there.  I
have even deleted the primary DOS partition (if it wasn't gone already),
reinstated it, then tried formatting, all to no avail.

Has anyone ran across anything like this, and, more importantly, a way to
disinfect it?

You should read the Virus-L/comp.virus FAQ.  The basics needed to answer
your question are all there--below I add some of my opinion as well. 8-)

No, it's not possible!  Well, it is really, with what are sometimes
referred to as "droppers" (they are really a type of trojan program,
purporting to do one thing and/or installing a virus in a "non-standard"
way).  Such beasties are rare (to non-existent--comments anyone?).

If a user has a boot infector and they tell you their machine --never--
is booted from a floppy they are lying (with a high enough likelihood
for me).  One reason this is common is because when they -do- boot from
a floppy, they get the message

Non-System disk or disk error
Replace and strike any key when ready

because they are normally doing so from a non-bootable one, then they
open the drive door and let the boot continue from the hard disk.  To
most users this is seen/reported as booting from the hard disk!

I'd have hoped that comp.virus/virus-l was above this sort of drivel!!

Nathaniel would do himself a favour by reading the FAQ carefully!!!!

The process described above --cannot-- result in an infected hard disk,
full stop, period, NEVER.

Well, in theory it -could-, though I am -not- suggesting that there is
actually an implementation of something like the following.  A resident
program loaded before WP (or any other app) ran could hook various disk
functions and when it sees a floppy disk access (caused by WP looking
for/loading a file) it could check the diskette to see if Stoned (or
some other boot virus) was present, and if so, it could do a non-
standard virus installation to the hard disk.

Why someone would -bother- doing this is completely beyond me.

What Nathaniel -may- have seen, and mis-reported, is the well-known
effect where, under certain conditions, access of an infected floppy
causes the boot sector to be re-read and the infected boot code -can-
remain in memory (in a disk buffer) long enough after the process that
read it terminates, that it is picked up by the --memory scan-- of some/
most scanners.  This is sometimes referred to as "ghosting".  NOTE that
in such cases the virus code is --not active-- (-despite- the wording of
the warning messages certain popular scanners pop-up in these cases), as
it has not been --executed-- in any sense, so hasn't had a chance to
hook into the usual system function calls it uses to do its work.

Jorge Faria wonders about whether PK's claim to PKLITE's being
non-reversible compression holds true.

Obviously, in order to run the program, the stub of PKLITE must
decompress the code in memory.  Whatever one program can do, another can
do.

I believe that there are five anti-virus programs out there which can
decompress PKLITE'd files.

Mine was the first, but that's just picking nits.

Please read the FAQ for more information about how to ask such
questions. In particular, which scanner did you use, which version of
it, what exactly does it report and so on.

"Hong Kong" is not one of the established virus names, although one
variant of the Sylvia virus is called like that, and I seem to recall
that one scanner used to call like that the Azusa virus. I am unable
to provide more information without further identification of the
virus. Could you please run the program F-Prot and tell me what it
reports?

No, the V-Sign virus doesn't do anything like this. Either CPAV has
messed something, or you have told you to update the information after
it has detected that the boot sector has changed.

Nope, it isn't.

Hm, in theory, BOOTSAFE should have detected the change in the MBR and
should have restored it automatically...

Of course. The virus infects the MBR when you try to boot from an
infected floppy (i.e., and infected floppy forgotten in drive A: when
you turn your computer on). At this time VSAFE is not loaded yet
(actually, even the operating system is not loaded yet), so there is
nothing strange that it has not detected the act of modifying your MBR
by the virus.

That's really a pity, because V-Sign is a relatively widespread
virus. But, the detection rate of CPAV 1.4 is rather miserable -
something like 68% and even that only if you have installed the latest
scan strings update.

There are a few viruses which target CPAV/MSAV specifically; nothing
surprising in that. V-Sign, however, is not one of them.

> 	I hope some people out there can tell me more about this virus.

The V-Sign virus is described in our Computer Virus Catalog. See the
FAQ for information how to get it.

> 	Has anyone tried the newest Version of CPAV... Version 2????

I tried to test CPAV 2.0, but its heuristic analyser made it crash
while scanning by virus collection. A few days ago I got a "very late
beta" of CPAV 2.1, which is supposed to be "much better". I'll try it
and will post the results.

After retrieving this file I noticed it contains an ASCII file and the

We have a new product available: TbFence. This is an automatic diskette
encryption/protection intended for use in workgroups or company sites. It
enables you to use diskettes throughout your company as you would usually do,
but if you take such a diskette to home without permission,you can't read it.
Also, you can't use 'foreign' diskettes on the company machines, until they
are approved and authorized by the gateway station.

For more information contact your TBAV dealer, or download or request the
shareware version of TbFence.

6.07 Product update
- -------------------

General information:
    -   Added PGP public key 'VELDMAN.PGP'. Read this file for information.

    -   The Anti-Vir.Dat file of the TBAV directory is now supplied with
        the TBAV package, for convenience and security. For additional
        security consult the - also new - file Security.Doc

TBAV:
    -   The TBAV menu shell is now always able to locate its help file,
        even started from another drive or directory.

TbScan:
    -   TbScan now also scans the master boot record of the second physical
        hard disk, to cope with portable hard disks.

    ->  TbScan no longer skips non-executable files if they appear to be
        non-executable. They are now always scanned if you use the 'AllFiles'
        option, even when the files contain invalid instructions. This was
        necessary because some people test scanners on viruses in files
        with no executable extension (sick!). Beware of false alarms if
        you use option 'AllFiles'!

    -   TbScan now exits with errorlevel 6 if a virus has been detected
        on a diskette. Previously, TbScan would always exit with
        errorlevel 5 when a virus has been found anywhere. This enables
        batch files to distinguish between a virus found on the hard
        disk and on a diskette.

    -   Bug fix: if you scan an invalid drive or damaged diskette TbScan
        will no longer dump garbage on the screen.

TbClean:
    -   Improved segment register emulation. TbClean is now able to clean
        even more viruses.

    -   It appears that some virus writers are scared by TbClean: they
        wrote a virus to trojanize TbClean. This VariCell virus will no
        longer be able to Trojanize TbClean. TbClean will - as expected
        - simply clean this virus.

    -   Added a few safety checks to TbClean to enable it to detect if
        it is being trojanized. A start-up sanity self-check is now
        implemented.

TbScanX:
    -   Loads now slightly faster

Viruses:
    -   Changed detection algorithms

        Satanbug                (eliminated a false positive)

    -   Removed signatures:

        Froggie Trojan          (caused false positives)

    -   Changed signatures:

        Antix Trojan            (eliminated a false positive)
        Bad_Taste Dropper       (eliminated a false positive)
        Cruncher                (now detects an additional variant)
        HideNowt                (now also detects the EXE samples)
        Intruder                (now detects an additional variant)
        Tonya                   (renamed to Skater.977)
        Zherkov                 (now detects an additional variant)

    -   Added signatures

Subject: Companion (or spawning) viral programs (CVP)

DEFGEND.CVP   930921

                             Companion

There is a valid argument which says that "companion" (or
"spawning") viral programs are not viral at all.  Companion viri
certainly do not link to existing program code, at least not in a
physical way.  It might be said that they use a certain provision of
the operation system to trick you into running them rather than the
program you meant to.  Thus it might be said to be closer to a
definition of a trojan.

On the other hand, companion programs do reproduce.  They also form,
in a sense, a logical link with existing programs.  Even though they
are very different technically, from the average user's perspective
they certainly behave in a viral fashion.

Operating systems will identify files which are executable, and
distinguish between them and files which either do not contain
executable code, or which may be executed only in special ways.  On
the Atari, only files with a PRG extension can be run, although
"accessory" files can set up "resident" utilities and functions at
startup.  MS-DOS, on the other hand, has three possible executable
file types, denoted by COM, EXE and BAT extensions.  AOS/VS has many
more:  I once saw a list of 150 executable filename extensions.

Because the different extensions provide an additional means to
distinguish a file, three different executable files, under MS-DOS,
can all have the same "file name".  You can have a WP.COM, WP.EXE
and WP.BAT.  Normally, a program is only invoked by calling the file
name; the extension is "filled in" by the operating system.  How,
then, does the computer decide which of these three to run?

The answer is built in to the operating system.  There are actually
four levels of programming to check for.  First, a search is made
for an "internal" command of the command interpreter.  If that
succeeds, that command is run.  Thus, under MS-DOS, no program named
DIR.COM will ever be run.  (Alright, unless you specify the full
file name.  Don't be picky.)  If the search does not succeed, the
computer looks for a file with that filename and a COM extension,
then an EXE extension, then a BAT extension.  At each stage, if the
search succeeds, the file is run; if it fails, it goes to the next
level.  Thus, in MS-DOS, COM takes precedence over EXE, which takes
precedence over bAT.

A companion virus can thus "infect" a STARTUP.BAT file by making a
copy of itself called STARTUP.EXE.  It can infect CPAV.EXE by
creating CPAV.COM.  (In fact, it is probably easiest simply to stick
to COM files, whether you are infecting EXEs or BATs.)  The COM file
will take precedence, and typing "CPAV" will always call the virus
first.
