What is going on? In the period between 1987-1992 I was heavily involved
with the computer virus issue through my job and personal interests.

At that time, I was seeing an average of two virus infections a month in
a customer base of 13000 installations. Now, with a company in the same
line of business, and a customer base of 2000 installations, I am seeing
an average of TWO INFECTIONS A DAY! Stoned, Stealth, HBD Joshi, Musicbug,
some Jerusalem, and an occasional disk-killer.

Have incidences of infection generally increased? Or do I just happen to
work for a company in VERY infected straights?!?

No one here is trying to 'validate' the writing of viruses, I am
just pointing out the warped logic used to against virus writing.

there are a lot of places in the world where you DON'T need a license
to buy or sell guns.
To go from general to specific does not help matters in this case.

Of course not.
The point here is not distribution, the point here is the making
and creating of viruses.
Distribution of viruses is another story.

Not really, you are just viewing things from the wrong angle!
There is no such thing as a 'certified virus-writer'! , there will never
be!!
This scenario is far off from the deed of just writing viruses and being
responsible about their distribution.

NO, this is a favorite analogy preferred by 'AntiVirus' types as they
often stigmatize viruses as dangerous things, much like weapons.
As i said it has yet to be proven that viruses are inherently
destructive!

viruses are not inherently destructive.  It is only the application of malicious
code within the virus that causes it to be destuctive.  That history shows that
most viruses to date does not prove the point that all viruses are malicious.

That a virus spreads by modifying some other program is not debatable.  That
the resulting changes to the infected program are good or bad can be discussed
only in the context of the behaviour of that newly infected program, and in the
way that the infection was carried out.  If the infection causes deliberate or
accidental destruction or otherwise interfers with the system, then I think
one could safely say that the infection is destructive.  On the other hand,
if the infection causes some benefit to system operation, such as compressing
or decompressing executables to free up disk space, then I doubt that anyone
could claim that the behaviour was destructive provided, however, that it was
not done in a way that obscured what was happening from the user.

Of course, there could be bugs in a beneficial virus which could cause
malicious results; i.e., loss of functionality.  Does this mean
that the virus is destructive?  I'm not sure; all software has bugs.  Are
problems caused by buggy software destructive?  Perhaps not for my word
processor, perhaps so for a Boeing 757 Flight Control System.

By the way Frisk, I want to thank you for the way in which you are
addressing this problem.  Unlike others in the business, your policy
of distribution is, I think, one of the finest examples of users
helping users that I have ever seen.  Your efforts are commendable,
and I wish there was an award that you could receive for your
contributions.

Last year about this time, I did some research for a Bank that I was
consulting for, and discovered that the FPROT engine was used in about
6 or 7 of the top 10 commercial virus scanners.  Based on my own
testing for the Bank, FPROT compared favorably in terms of
performance.  But your product stood heads above *any* other package
in terms of your licensing policies.  I sincecerly hope that my
recommendation that they license your product was taken.

Ummm, I kinda disagree with the above. Not every program that causes
modifications is harmful - otherwise you'll rule out as such almost
any program on my disk.

I would put the emphasis on *authorization*. That is, every program
that causes *unauthorized* modifications AND/OR interruptions is
harmful. The "and/or" part is needed for those viruses that ask for
permission befor infecting a file. They *can* cause harm, for instance
in a real-time application that controls some life-critical
installation. Interrupting the application with the question "May I
infect that file? (Y/N)" might have desastrous consequences.

And, the word "unauthorized" in the above definition applies *both* to
"modifications" and "interruptions", in case this is not clear from
the context.

Vesselin

    Well, I can only point out an oddity I discovered after install.exe has
    finished the installation.

    The size of files inoculated by CPAV were decreased by 5 bytes. Is this
    normal ? I use Stacker 3.0, Dos 5.0, and InVircible version 5.01.

    Untouchable reported , for example:

    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    File: C:\PCTOOLS\cpav.exe
     * File size decreased by 5 bytes (from 198,865 to 198,860 bytes).
     * WARNING: Last modification date was not changed!!
    ACTION:
       Alert ignored. This alert will be generated again.

    File: C:\PCTOOLS\vwatch.com
     * File size decreased by 5 bytes (from 32,155 to 32,150 bytes).
     * WARNING: Last modification date was not changed!!
    ACTION:
       Alert ignored. This alert will be generated again.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    By the way, has anyone done a good/detailed review on Invircible yet
    and is 5.01 the latest version ?

    TIA.

Shez will do that. I have mine configured to use F-Prot rather than
Scan. If you want to scan more than standard executables, such as .DLL,
386, or whatever, select "A" for all in SHEZCFG under which files to
scan, and specify your desired extensions with /EXT= in the command line
field. If you want to scan more than what SHEZ considers standard
executables, and don't tell SHEZCFG to extract all, it won't extract
them for F-Prot to scan.

VESSELIN BONTCHEV was heard to say on 12-10-93:

VB>The VirStop that comes with the commercial (professional) version

I called the U.S. rep about that a few weeks ago, and found out that
unfortunately they don't have free monthly updates for the professional
version. You either have to pay for each monthly update, or get a yearly
subscription service (cheaper than ordering each monthly update). I
continue to use NAV (3.0 now that I have NDW 3) resident to get any
infection report while I'm in Windows, which is most of the time (they
have free monthly signature updates on their BBS). It won't find as many
viruses as F-Prot can, but getting a strange beep (if you even notice
it) that wasn't passed to a Window's dialog box doesn't help either
because you're unlikely to know what caused it and will usually continue
working (and possibly infecting). Since I still scan all incoming files
with F-Prot using SHEZ for automated scanning of archives, I'm not too
worried about anything that NAV 3.0 would miss. If the Virstop with the
professional version is like the regular version (in what it will
identify), it wouldn't find everything that F-Prot normally would
anyway (since I think you mentioned that it uses the same scanning as
F-Prot in Quick mode rather than in Secure mode), so I don't think I've
lost much in my trade-off. Everything is a trade-off between convience
and ease of use and absolute protection anyway.

If you do most of your work in Windows (like I do), it might be a very
long time before you exit Windows and see that message though. You could
have been infected all day, while you continued along in your work,
infecting more files as you went, and possibly spreading the infection
to another machine through a floppy. OTOH, if you don't work in Windows
much, I imagine it wouldn't be much of a concern.

Subject: MSAV Strings Being Picked Up By SCAN (PC)

I use posted this in a virus conference that I read on a local BBS...

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is anybody out there aware of the virus which is embedded in MS-DOS 6.00
and later? It's some kind of WeIrD modification of an older boot sector
virus known as "1226".  I could only isolate it in MWAV.EXE and
MWAVSCAN.DLL.  As far as I can tell, neither file was altered
performance-wise(MWAV saved me from many disks infected with
stoned.NoInt).  Another odd feature of the virus is that I have found NO
way to detect and remove this virus EXCEPT with an old version of
McAfee's CLEAN, specifically v67(it came packaged in a ZIP called
CLEANP67.ZIP).  This virus has occurred both on my computer, which is
now DOS 6.20, and on some other computers I have access to with DOS
6.00.  Does anybody know what this virus does?
===============================================================================

I told him that it was probably just an old version of Scan picking up
the unencrypted virus signatures of MSAV.  Is my conclusion correct?

The virus list in F-PROT only includes half of the viruses the program
detects...there is a major revision of the virus database under development.

We added detection of Winvir several versions ago...not sure about Twitch,

I just ftp'ed the thing home - the latest version is '210c' - Oakland
does not seem to have reached further than version '210' (Dec 14) while
risc.au.edu has '210b' as well as '210c' - available.

Version 210c - gives the following 'non-error message' if you run it
in a DOS-window under windows:
    Error opening C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\USER.EXE
    Error opening C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\USER.EXE
    ..
    ..
    etc (in my case a total of 12)

It only means that the files are reserved (e.g. running) and thus not
scanned!

By the way Frisk - when will the 'virus data base be updated' ??

Well, to answer this question, one has to first define "virus"....if the
definition is only based on the ability to replicate, then I can think of an
working, semi-useful application - an anti-virus program that "spread" over
a network, in order to make sure that all users were running the most
up-to-date version.  Of course, this would be called something different
"Automantic updating" or whaever, but I guess Fred Cohen would still consider
it a virus.

However, regarding anti-virus technology included in more "traditional"
viruses...infeasibple, impractical, and (in some countries) probably illegal
as well..

Winvir is more like a Windows aware virus.  It does not actually infect
Windows executable files.

Twitch is supposed to be able to ifnect Windows .EXE's, but I've yet to
see it replicate.  The sample I have seen was definitely a Windows file,
though.

The Monkey virus, as you reffered to it, is indeed a variant of
stoned. Wether the monkey variants are new or not is more of a
relative question. The full name (CARO-standard) for these viruses are
Stoned.Empire.Monkey.A and Stoned.Empire.Monkey.B. I don't know if
other Monkey viruses than these two exists.

Conclusion: F-Prot 2.10 did not mis-identify the virus. It just failed
to determine the exact variant of that virus-family. An other scanner
might have called it Stoned, thus giving you a choice of over 100
variants to pick from ;-)

Ooops. :-( The bug doesn't seem to occur often, because I did check
the CS:IP fields of the disinfected files during my experiments and
they were OK. I also checked whether the virus is removed from the
file - it was. I did not check the SS:SP fields, though.

I received the update from Eugene and it is now available from our
anonymous ftp site. The full reference is

ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de:/pub/virus/progs/avp_upd.zip

Note: this is *only* the update. You still need to download the main
package - 1.07b (in avp_107b.zip). This update updates it to 1.07c.
The updates do not change the version numbers, and besides, the
letters are not present in the version number. The letters in the
version change when only the database with virus detection/removal
information is updated, while the numbers change when the executables
are updated too. In particular, version 1.07b means "version 1.07 of
the executables, with the database updated once".

Sigh... This *ought* to go in the FAQ. Yes, I know that something like
that is mentioned there, but it neads more straightforward
explanation.

In short: you very probably don't have a virus. Check your CONFIG.SYS
and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. Very probably, you start a program from one of
them. This program is called VSAFE. Remove it from those files and the
problem will go away. This is called "ghost positive" and the term
*is* explained in the FAQ.

>       Can anybody tell me anything about these two viruses.  I printed out

It doesn't really matter. You almost certainly don't have them.

>     the scan109 virus list text file and SWEDISH DISASTER isn't on the list.
>     VISPY may call it SWEDISH DISASTER but what does SCAN call it?  Why

SCAN 109 calls it "Stoned [Stoned]". That is - it doesn't distinguish
it from the real Stoned virus, of which this is a variant. But you are
not infected.

>     scan my hard drive.  How can I get rid of these viruses.   Windows

Get rid of VSAFE and all the rest of the package that accompanies it,
whether it is called CPAV or MSAV or TNTVIRUS or whatever.

It is almost certainly not related to this problem.

Subject: Announcing HS v3.5, Anti-boot virus program (PC)

        *** Announcing HS v3.5, Anti-boot virus program ***

 This is a major upgrade. The previous version released on the Internet
 was v3.2 (a year ago). Viruses like the russian Strange using hardware
 stealth, and Stoned.Empire.INT_10.A and B using a new un-named stealth
 technique, has made it necessary to implement some new lines of defense.

 Version 3.5 will after installation detect all known boot infectors as
 of today. Any boot infector will automatically be removed to bring the
 system back to a virus-free condition. HS will probably also detect and
 remove many future boot viruses.

 Loaded as a device driver from the CONFIG.SYS it uses approximately one
 second to check if the boot sectors are infected. No memory is used, as
 it does not need to be resident to ensure a boot virus free system. The
 main program, HS.SYS, is less than 5 KB in size. Speed and size are the
 result of writing everything in assembly language.

 This version of HS should be compatible with MS-DOS 3.2 --> 7.0, PC-DOS
 3.2 --> 6.1, as well as with DR-DOS 6.0. Machines using the BootManager
 that comes with OS/2, as well as machines using Windows NT's Flexboot
 may also use HS, when booting DOS.

 Using this program together with one of the top virus scanners might be
 the ideal anti-virus setup for most personal computers. This is what I
 had in mind when I created it, and it has proven to be very successfull
 at the local university. Boot virus related problems only have to be
 fixed manually at times when a virus causes the machine to crash before
 the HS.SYS program has a chance to run. The recovery is then performed
 by inserting a DOS system disk containg a CONFIG.SYS that executes the
 HS.SYS from the floppy.

 HS v3.5 has been uploaded to several major anti-virus archives, and
 should be available by FTP and E-Mail shortly.

 Henrik Stroem

Subject: New anti-virus package announcement (PC)

   Hello everyone,

The new VDS (Virus Detection System) 3.0c Shareware Edition is uploaded to
Oak and some of its mirrors; the file name is VDS30C.ZIP.

This release of the package is intended to allow potential customers to
evaluate the suitability of the product to their needs. It is a fully
functional copy that lacks a few features of the Pro version (see the docs
for details). Most of the package is re-written to address some of the
compatibility issues that emerged within the last year. VDS is now Windows 3.x
and DoubleSpace(TM) compatible, and it offers better network support.

VDS 3.0c includes a fast virus scanner, a robust integrity checker with
anti-stealth capability, a generic virus remover, external signature support,
emergency diskette preparation, a very versatile decoy launcher, a low-level
disk recovery tool, readable documentation, excellent Netware support (not
just compatible), automatic and semi-automatic installation (with de-install
feature), and a redesigned object-oriented (seriously) user interface.

VDS 3.0 emphasizes integrity checking, but also provides known virus scanning.
Its catalog-based integrity database supports both DOS drives and Novell
volumes. Newly-added installation program simplifies protecting workstations
by offering complete electronic distribution and configuration options. Once
in place, VDS can perform periodic (user-definable) integrity checks and
scans without further user intervention.

System requirements:
   IBM PC compatible computer
   Hard disk (for integrity checker) with 512K free space
   420K of memory available
   Optional 192K extended memory for large catalogs
   MS/PC-DOS 3.0 or later

If you are looking for a comprehensive and up-to-date anti-virus package,
we invite you to try VDS. It's only an FTP away! Let us know what you think.
