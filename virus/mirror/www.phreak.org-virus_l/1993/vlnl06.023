This amusing non sequitur points out a common misconception.  For some
reason, there is the implicit assumption made by people outside the
academic community--and, distressingly, my many people *inside* it--
that student research has to be assigned or authorised before the
student is permitted to use university facilities in its pursuit.

RTM might have done a lot of terrible things, and he might have gotten
exactly what he deserved, but his worm doesn't fail to classify as
valid academic research only because he didn't get permission from
professors or university administration.

A "university" that requires such permission can hardly call itself a
university.  Any institution that treats students with that level of
contempt is better termed an "academic cattle drive".

As the old saying about statistics goes, "Figures don't lie, but
liars can figure...".  The problem is that 60% of the data *centers*
reported viruses.  Now.. Let's look at this in detail (using our
site as an example)...

Here at Virginia Tech, the main computing center has a 3090, a 3084, a
4381, several high-end RS/6000 boxes, a Vax 8800, and probably 75 to
100 desktop systems in the NeXT/Mac II/RS6K-200/Decstation class on
programmer's desks.  This is all in our main facility in the university
computing center, which is actually off-campus (it was cheaper/faster
to build a new building there).  The computing center also maintains
several on-campus computer labs that are usually stocked with some
386-based clone.

Now - if one of our labs gets wiped out by a virus, this will be a
disaster (at least for the guy in Operations who gets to clean up).  So
we're in the 35.5%.  It was virus based. So we're in the 60%.  And we
*do* have mainframes here.  So we would qualify, even though the virus
literally never got within 2 miles of our mainframes.

Of course, if Wilson's survey *specifically* addressed mainframe-*based*
viruses, that's a different story.  But I doubt that...

Subject: Re:Wank [Rob Slade:v06 ?21]

Comparing Rob Slade's report on Wank with the final report of
Th.Langstaff and E.Eugene Schultz from Lawrence Livermoore National
Laboratory with title: "Beyond Preliminary Analysis of the WANK and
OILZ Worms: A Case Study of Malicious Code" (and my own analysis of
WANK#1), I find several differences.  Among others, the password
attacks were not essentially on "system" etc, and moreover, these
worked only correctly in the 2nd WANK version (called OILZ according
to some field in the code) which was an *essential* update of WANK
(not "vary few changes"). Due to some self-modifying part (this worms
were oligomorphic!), there was some confusion in the initial analysis
about different versions of Wank. Code analysis showed that there were
essentially 2 distinct authors (plus one for arranging final code),
with clearly differentiated tasks and skills. Finally, the most
interesting part of WANK (which affected significantly less systems
than Internet worm) was how Incident handling was done, rather than
the worm's functionality.

While I generally favour Robert Slade's short reports in Virus-L on
network incidents, I strongly suggest that trustful sources of
detailed information are mentioned for further reading. The
Anti-Malware community should have enough experience that myths spread
much faster and live longer than plain truth -:)

It is just a matter of definitions. The difference expressed above
disappears if you consider that the whole OS of a computer is nothing
more than a complex program and a wrom "attaches" itself to the
execution of this program.

Maybe it is better to put it this way:

1) What Dr. Cohen calls "viruses" is what most other people would call
"programs that are able to replicate themselves". They include worms,
DISKCOPY, etc.

2) What most other people call "viruses" are programs that attach
themselves to the execution of other programs. They are not worms -
worms are stand-alone programs, not attached to the execution of a
"hast" program.

Sorry, there is a MS-DOS virus, called Dr_Watson, which does exactly
that. And we are still calling it a "virus".

The main problem is not in the definition of the word "virus". The
main problem is that there are several things (BSIs, companion
viruses, file system infectors, AUTOEXEC.BAT infectors, etc.) which
look much more like worms but we are still calling them "viruses"...

But the orginal question STILL remains: how are you going to find
the virus writers ?
The actions as described above kinda scare me.
There seems to be continous 'fright-propaganda' about viruses and the
idea is to let people think "viruswriter = criminal"

Let's say that someone leaked to the police that *I* was the one
responsible for the Michaelangelo outbreak.
Then let's say they find out that I hang out with a strange group Interested
in Assembly language programming and genereal computing 'hacking'.
If someone would ever look through my files and data they *WOULD*
find the sourcecode for MA, documented,  and some other viruses.
Where could that leave me ?

The moral of the story is just that, no matter what data you find, you can
NEVER prove anything based on that data .
As widespread as Viruses have come it does not take a long time to create
the source for, let's say, 1704 bytes virus and comment it to the point
that there is no trace of the source-code-generator.

Even if they actualy found the real writer of MA and all the code and test-
versions he probably made, they couldn't do a thing unless of course they
had some other information on him/(her?).

I don't remember what group it was but someone posted a request resently
for virus-code.
In short 'hell broke loose' almost anyone reading the posting seemed to
belive he was going to use that code for evil purposes.
It seemes impossible for those interested, to get the code/data for viruses.
Of course that does not surprice me, as I know what most people think of
viruses and that there would always be someone to misuse that.
On the other hand it shouldn't be that strange that someone offered to sell
the code/data to whoomever is interested.

In short : do viruses realy have to be that 'taboo'
Informing people about them and how they work and even distribute simple
samples could be just as effective as the fright-propaganda.
The reason for I learned Assembly language was to be able to write
a virus.  And so I did (I wrote a wariant of vienna).
Then Stealth-viruses came along and that tecnology excited me.
But as I learned more about them and how they work the 'miracle' tag
dropped off.

The idea of writing a virus doesn't excide me anymore.  I wouldn't be doing
anything new.  I got issue 1 of CVDQ and there virus there shows me that
poople have to spent anourmous time to make a virus that is going to
have a faint-change of surviving in the modern-world.
I guess that most of those who do write viruses and release them wouldn't
if they knew better.  They probably think that they're adding new variants
to a pool of a couple of viruses and that a lottsa people are going to
see and inspect/admire there code.

We all know that the viruses are here to stay and noone can stop
there spread.
If we choose to follow the path we're on it's just a question of time
when viruses will outnumber the scanners to the point that they will
drown of the sheer mass-code.
I guess most of us can aggree on that,that will happen sooner or later
the question is just what path we want to take to that point.

How come I get an engraved invitation?
...

	I must admit that I am now totally lost.  I don't understand
what you are trying to communicate.  Is it a proposed english language
definition of a virus and a pseudo-proof that detection is hard without
requiring infinite tapes? Is it 3 different proposed definitions and
three pseudo-proofs, one for each definition? Is it the concept of
conditional `infection'? Are you using a different concept than the
common one for the term undecidability? Perhaps we should consider
things piecewise - one definition per article - one point at a time.  It
just gets too confusing to deal with so many variations at once.  You
ask for my comment on a non-conclusive proof (designated by the phrase
`for all practical purposes') - but there is no such thing as far as I
can tell.  Either it is a proof or it is not.  If it is a proof, it is
conclusive, otherwise, it is not - that's what a proof is!

	You say you are trying to convince people with insufficient
background that virus detection is `undecidable'.  But without enough
background, the term itself is meaningless.  Maybe you are going after
the wrong thing.  Perhaps you should simply try to show them that it is
hard with a simple example.  That usually works for me.  See my short
course book for how I usually do it if you are interested.

Hi,
in my previous posting "+- viruses" I did not try to give another definition.
I was and am still missing the point wether a piece of software is necessary
for a user to do what he wants or not. If we add this question to the last
definition of Vesselin, then Diskcopy will not show up as virus, as it is
necessary to use this program to copy a floppy.

Hello,

Yesterday I downloaded ASIG9301.ZIP; some additional virus-signatures
for TbScan 5.03. I checked my hard-disk and got a virus-alarm!!!
TbScan reported that the file DIRX.EXE from DRX109.ZIP was infected by
the Necropolis virus.  Today I downloaed DRX109.ZIP from
ftp.terra.stack.urc.tue.nl (a simtel mirror), and the original
DIRX.EXE from DRX109.ZIP was infected as well.

Is this just a false alarm by TbScan ? (The Second in 2 weeks ...)  Or
do I really have a virus in my PC? (On my 20Mb disc only DIRX was
infected).

Please send any answers directly to robkn@blade.stack.urc.tue.nl and
put them on the net as well...

So how do you know that 3 files are infected by it? Who told you so?
Which scanner? Which version? Please, read the FAQ to learn what
information has to be supplied in questions like the above...

To my knowledge, mainly McAfee's SCAN calls the MtE-based viruses
"DAME". It is not -a- virus, it is a tool for building very
polymorphic viruses. In your case you probably have a false positive -
only 3 infected files doesn't sound much like any of the known
MtE-based viruses...

The version that we have here (2.1 with updates of December 1992)
claims to check for more than 1,400 strains, so obviously still need

When tested on our virus collection, NAV detects roughly 70-80% of
them, which agrees with its claims (1,400 is about 73% of 1,900 - the
number of different viruses in our collection). Unfortunately, I am
not able to provide a more exact number, because NAV lacks some
features that would be useless to its users but would greatly
facilitate the testing. In particular, it does not put the names of
the files is doesn't consider to be infected in its report file and is
unable to apply its algorithm for boot sector scanning to files
containing images of boot sectors.

For comparison - McAfee's SCAN gets about 90% and FindVirus and F-Prot
get about 95-98%.

Note: some people argue that such numbers do not make much sense,
because what really has to be tested is how well a scanner detects the
viruses that are in the wild. I am unable to provide such testing and
I disagree with this belief, for several reasons. Will describe them, if
there is enough interest.

Subject: Suggestion to the developers of resident scanners (PC)

Hello, everybody!

My colleague in front of me is working on an old 12 MHz AT, with no
ex{te|pa}nded memory and a slow hard disk. He's using Dr. Solomon's
resident scanner GUARD. In order to keep memory requirements low,
GUARD is swapping the virus signatures to the disk. This makes the
system -horribly- slow, so my colleague considers removing the
protection. There are versions of GUARD that swap to EMS, XMS, or to a
RAM disk, but this doesn't help him, 'coz he has none of these...

I understand that Frisk also intends to make a version of VirStop that
keeps the virus signatures on the disk and loads them when necessary.
This means VirStop will become almost unusable on the system I am
talking about too... What do you want, not everybody has a '486... :-)

One solution is to have an option that forces the resident scanner to
keep the virus signatures in memory. This is fast, but could take a
lot of memory as the number of viruses increases...

In the same time, more resident scanners provide the possibility to
scan executable files not only when they are about to be executed, but
also when they are copied. Of course, if enabled, this slows down the
system additionally.

I would like to propose to the developers of resident scanners to
provide the following mode:

1) Scan the file when it is executed ONLY if it resides on a floppy.

2) Scan a file with executable extension on CLOSE, if this file has
been WRITTEN TO -and- if it resides on the hard disk ONLY.

The advantage is:

1) By scanning files that are written to, you also catch viruses when
they are unpacked from archives, not just when they are copied.

2) If your system is virus-free, then you can catch a virus only if
you execute something from a floppy, or if you copy something infected
to your hard disk and execute it afterwards. The above methods catches
the virus in both cases.

3) When you execute files from the hard disk (the usual situation),
there is no overhead for scanning. Thus, the performance of the system
is less affected.

4) When you copy files between different directories of the hard disk,
there is no scanning overhead.

5) When you copy files from the hard disk to floppies, there is no
scanning overhead, which is a plus, because floppy disk access is slow
anyway...

Of course, I am not saying that this must be the only mode. Users
should be able to always scan on execution and/or copying, if they
want so. The behavior proposed by me should be provided as an option
- - a rather useful option, IMHO.

Any comments from the producers of resident scanners?

Norton anti-virus detected Twelve-Tricks virus on one of our PCs but
f-prot 2.06a reported the PC as clean. Is this virus one that the
current f-prot misses or have we found a NAV false +ve?

Subject: STONED, Scanv99/Clean 99 Questions/Concerns (PC)

Over the past several days our school has been dealing with the
Stoned virus.  We've come up with some questions about what might
be going on:

1) When Untouchable is used, it says that No-Int has been found but
that it cannot fix it.

2) When McAfee's Scan v99 is used, it finds the Stoned virus,
and the Clean can clean it.  HOWEVER, when scanning AGAIN for the
virus, we find it in memory.  This is after having booted from a
write-protected virus free floppy disk.  Further tests apparently
show that Stoned can load into memory by a simple read on an
infected disk.  The documentation I've read via FTP land say that that
is impossible.  Some people have suggested that Scan is not correct.

Questions: Why doesn't Untouchable work right?  CAN the Stoned virus
load into memory by a simple read from an infected floppy??  Is there
a strain of stoned that can do this?

Thanks for any help/suggestions.

Ulysses.

A friend of mine has a 486 that recently crashed.  After booting on a
clean disk, I ran ScanV100 on it, and found that it had the Stoned
virus.  I cleaned it off, and ran scan again, only to find that it now
had Michaelangelo virus.  I ran clean again, this time with [Mich],
and it reported that the virus had been cleaned off.  However, after
cleaning, ScanV100 still reported it was in the partition table, and
the drive will still not boot.  Both floppies in the computer are
write protected and are virus-free.  I have now run Clean c: [Mich]
approx. 30 times, each time, it says it cleaned the drive, and then
after rebooting, Scan still reports the virus is there.  Any ideas?

Thanks-

SCAN 100 detected an 1575 virus on an 286 AT with DOS 3.30. The virus
was detected during memory scan after any kind of TSR program was
installed residently. I then found, that COMMAND.COM was 4 bytes longer,
than the original COMMAND.COM: 86h,05h,86h,05h, if I remember correctly.
(or was it 05h,86h,...?). Anyway, that shouldn't be dangerous. I reloaded
COMMAND.COM from that PC's original DOS 3.30 disk, and no viruses were
reported.
