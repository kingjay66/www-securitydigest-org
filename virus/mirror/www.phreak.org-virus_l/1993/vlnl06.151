Subject: Bleeding edge & scanners?

      I've seen a recent rash of "Is this the newest version?" and "where
   else is this package available" messages on here ...

      Since it's beginning to look like a large number of anti-virus ppl
   are on the net (whatever gave me that idea?  :^) - how about a possible
   solution to these that would keep the FAQs up-to-date, and the dates &
   CRCs for the most recent versions in "authorized" sites?  With c.virus
   being a moderated list (and I'm not complaining or offering to replace
   the moderator - I'm lucky to keep up with the messages as is) any time
   a new release is "announced," there's a bit of lagtime between it's
   actual release and the announcement circulating.

      This morning I grabbed FP_210.zip (ftp://oak.oakland.edu/pub/msdos/ -
   virus/fp_210.zip) which has a Nov 21 (yesterday) date.  Generally I don't
   worry about CRCs, secure archives - the whole shooting match.  But - by
   the same factor - I am often a couple of weeks behind releases of F-Prot.

      I checked the newsgroup to see if there had been a release note - it
   hasn't come through yet.  So - I'll probably end up sitting on this one
   until I see a note because I have no way to be sure that it's legit.

      Perhaps it's just a minor point, but it might be an overall answer to
   some of the "most recent" questions if the AV people could keep verbose
   archive listings in their .plan files ... or have a dummy account with a
   listing in it's .plan file.  I suppose that this would be asking everyone
   to check the FAQ before asking "recent version" questions ... but we all
   do that already, don't we?  :^)

Most analogies are, including yours, as I will show below.

While they are indeed not living organisms, they can very well
"escape" against the will of the person who has them, if this person
it not knowledgeable and/or no careful enough. I am certain that many
readers of Virus-L/comp.virus can confrim that, based on their own
experience. Heck, even I have once accidentally released a virus on my
computer and the sucker succeeded to infect al lot of four files,
before I figured out what's happening and was able to stop it.

That doesn't prevent them from spreading rather well.

The main properties of computer viruses I was refering to were
"spreading" and "causing damage". Is *this* what you are calling
"non-existent properties"?

> If you take a couple of

If you take the proper preventive measures, you can prevent even a
tiger from escaping. You have completely missed my point. My point was
that *if* the tiger (or the virus) escapes and causes damage, then you
are liable for it.

Your analogy is flawed too. You are standing on US-centric positions.
The world is wide and there are many countries in which owning,
buying, or selling a weapon *is* illegal, regardless of whether you
misuse it or not.

(Please, folks, it is not my intention to start a gun/anti-gun
flamewar here. I just want to point out that just because something is
allowed in your country, you should not assume that it is also allowed
everywhere else in the world. Also, unlike guns, computer viruses
*are* able to spread and to cross national boundaries.)

Nope. The bottom line is whether damage is caused. And spreading
computer viruses *is* causing damage.

You all know? Then all your knowledge is wrong. :-) First of all,
there is no such thing as a "CARO virus collection". It simply doesn't
exist. Each CARO member is maintaining his own virus collection.
Second, anybody can claim whatever they want (e.g. "I have the CARO
virus collection", or "I wrote the K-4 virus", or "I know who killed
JFK", or whatever). However, irresponsible claims tend to lower the
reputation of the person who is making them.

Yes, I would agree with the above. That's why, the more limited the
circle of people who get malicious code is, the better. This is one of
the reasons why I am opposed to the virus exchange BBSes. It is just
irresponsible to distribute malicious code without any control
whatsoever on who will get it and what it will be used for.

If this "someone" manifactures firecrackers and distributes them to
children, telling them "look how great it will be to put some fire on
that building" - yes, such person should be held liable.

Besides, there are many *useful* applications for firecrackers. I have
yet to see *one* useful application of a computer virus (as most
people understand it, not as Dr. Cohen undertsands it) that cannot be
performed (often much better) by a non-viral program.

Not quite. All I am saying is that the computer viruses as we have
seen them -can- and -are- destructive. I don't think that anybody
thinks otherwise. If you do, you are seriously fooling yourself.
Whether computer viruses are inherently destructive in theory is a
different question and I will be glad to do some research in this
direction, but we are not talking about the theory now. We are talking
about the viruses that exist *now* and that destroy data *now*.

You seem to have missed you lessons of formal logic. Maybe you should
have payed more attention at school. We are not arguing that it is
proven that there isn't a good use for a virus. We are just saying
that none has been found yet and all the currently created ones are
destructive - some of them intentionally, some of them not.

Hello, everybody!

The November issue of "Virus News International" has published an

I have had the fotunate experience of not having taken any law classes,
so this makes me seem much more like a "common sense citizen" - at
least, that is how I think of myself.

Why are there laws (in my country, at least), that say you can't take
other people's property, or kill people?  Maybe my... er, uh, religion,
says this is okay.  However, the rest fo society doesn't think so.  They
think that would be unethical.  So they make laws.  Laws, in this
country, are supposed to be made by the people, to protect the people,
for the people.  And, laws DO change.  Can you say, "repeal",

Yes, laws do need to be defined well, and that is why we have this stuff
called voting in this country - so we pick people that we think will make
laws which represent our thoughts.  If they don't, then we get someone
else that does agree with us.

I am not going to get into the what is a virus definition here, but
the user is clearly benefitting from the use of Stacker or DOuble
Space.  They want to have it.  They think it's a useful piece of software.

By them willingly installing the software on their computer, they are
saying, "I authorize this program to work on my computer".  Now, they
don't have so much control over a virus, do they?  I'm not talkign about
the scanty few which tell you they are infecting a file or what-not, but
the general population of viruses - the 99% that don't do that.

Yes!  If you are negligent.  There are laws which will charge a parent with
manslaughter if a child finds a gun that has not been properly secured and
shoots someone.  And if you want to still use this analogy, if I buy a
gun (a program) but the firing mechanism blows up in my face (trojan/viral
code), yes the gun manufacturer is liable.

Subject: Percentage of virus that infect boot sectors

While discussing anti-viral strategies with a user the other day, the subject
of backups (naturally) came up.  Of course, a good backup strategy should be
your first line of defense against virus problems.

I noted that use of a tape backup can be especially effective against boot
sector virus, as there is no boot sector on a tape to carry the infection
into your backups (as opposed to a file infector).

My question is, what percentage of known virus are boot sector infectors?
What percentage of common (ie., "in the wild") virus are boot sector?

Subject: essex virus (PC)

Recently, there have been a number of infections of the Essex Virus here
on campus...I've searched far and wide for more information on this virus
only to find nothing on the net...I've even gone so far as to check the
documentation of Scan and Central Point AV, as well as write McAfee's
support line on the net (which didn't know anything about it, although the
program detected it)...

An individual within the department found a way to remove the virus from
HD's, but I'm unsure if this will remove it from floppies also...it was in
the following batch file:

  FDISK /MBR
  SYS C:

I know this works fine for the hard drive, but will it also work for
infected floppies (of which I have several dozen to disinfect)...only a
handful of the floppies are boot disks (therefore the "sys" command won't
help out there)...

I would also appreciate any other information about the virus (ie actual
location of infection and method of infection [besides boot rec virus, etc)...

please e-mail me at mosier@moose.uvm.edu as I do not subscribe to this
list, as well as to save bandwidth...

I believe this is a bug in 7.0, because Qualitas has released a upgrade of
7.0 to 7.1 (a EXE-file called M700A.EXE). You will also have to load VIRSTOP
before the 386MAX.SYS.
I don't know if this M700A.EXE-file is available public, but I guess you can

Hmm... From the above description, I get it that the code that tells
the BIOS to "enable" the (normally hidden) reference partition is in
the boot sector. The fact that it is possible at all via software,
looks like a security hole to me. What would prevent a virus writer
from implementing the same code in a, say, boot sector virus and make
it infect the reference partition at boot time? And, as you said
yourself, it is not trivial to disinfect it...

What was the reason to introduce this reference partition at all?

Hm... SCAN indeed can report more than one virus when only a single
one is present. However, I am not aware of any cases when it reports
Stoned twice. The duplicate reports for SCAN 108 and boot sector
viruses from my collection are:

CARO virus name:	Viruses reported by SCAN 108:
================	=============================
BootEXE.452		BFD [BFD], Generic Boot [Genb]
Joshi.B			ExeBug1 [ExBg1], Generic Boot [Genb]

The duplicate (and even triplicate) reports happen much more often
with file viruses. This is a bug reported to McAfee Associates more
than half a year ago, yet it has never been fixed. If there is enough
interest, I can post the full list of multiple reports for file
viruses.

1) Between the Del_Old_Dos.1 and the STEPUP directory (which must be on C if
   you use the defaults) and the new files, make sure you have at least
   6-7 Mb free before you start. I saw no check for this.

2) Machine seemed to hang for a very long time at about the 81% mark
   (5% note in lower right of screen). At this point the new IO.SYS and
   MS-DOS.SYS files have been copied but the new COMMAND.COM is not yet
   present. If you abort here, I suspect the PC will not boot properly.
   Eventually it does continue but that particular sequence is very slow.

3) The installation found *something* wrong with mode.com and memmaker.exe
   & refused to update them (told the setup to continue anyway & would
   suggest this - see last two sentances in (2). (Both were originals dated
   3-10-93)

4) If you have downloaded the "supplemental" files for DOS 6.0, these are not
   included and will probaby whine "incorrect version". Skilled use of
   Ben Capstricum's UNP (UNP312.zip) plus DEBUG (look for the string 30 cd 21
   and change the CMP AX,0006 that follows closely to CMP AX,1406) "fixed"
   this without using SETVER (no garentees at all 8*). Curiously while most
   DOS programs use Packed files, CHKDSK used PKLITE. The very annoying
   disclaimer about using SCANDISK instead can also be removed with DEBUG.

5) The NOVELL NETX332.EXE for MS-DOS 6.0 had the same problem - not liking
   the 6.20 version number. I just do not like SETVER - Note: of the
   multi-screen default SETVER load, NONE of the entries were what I use.

6) HIMEM.SYS now has a lengthy (10+ seconds on 286 with 4 Mb extended) check
   of extended memory but at least it tells you what it is doing.

7) As previously mentioned, no update to MSAV appeared to be performed
   (files still dated 3-10-93)

8) Like on a full instalation, DELOLDOS will remove the "old" DOS directory
   but does not remove the STEPUP directory - you'll have to do that manually.

9) Do not use DBLSPACE on this machine so have not tried as yet. SCANDISK is
   nice but take a coffee break.

Everyone deserves to be blasted sometime.  But this is not our time.

VSAFE is *not* a Norton product!

VSAFE is from Central Point and all you have to do is listen to Vesselin

Several people have written suggesting that this may be a bug in
some versions of Scan, or an interaction with other software.
However we also encountered the message, and have established
that it is not a bug, but a normal feature of both Scan108 and
Scan109 (Yes; the McAfee version, not the one with the new
Ignorant virus, which I am told is widely available on Aussie
BBS's).

Have just done some tests with the help of a TSR called Grab,
which does just that - it grabs a chunk of memory and sits on it,
but does nothing else.

Here is what we found with Scan109

     Available memory    Result

          393K           Appeared to run normally till I scanned
                         a dirty directory.  On one pass it just
                         stopped after maybe 200 files with no
                         message.  On the next it checked almost
                         400 files, then gave the message

                             Sorry,I need more RAM memory.
                             390K bytes should be enough.

          381K           Announced "Scanning boot sector of drive
                         E:", then gave the message and stopped

          360K           Message immediately after "Scan 9.20V109
                         Copyright ..."

          280K           Immediately got message "Abnormal
                         program termination."

Incidentally Scan109 has almost established another milestone; it
takes 9M 40 sec to scan a nearly full 360K floppy on an XT!

By comparison VET 7.5 will do a normal scan, with no limitations
whatever, if there is 260K available, and will do a partial scan
(which will detect the 200 odd viruses which are at all common,
and automatically repair infected files and boot sectors) if
there is 140K available.

Oh, and it checks the floppy on the XT in 21 secs.

Cheers!

Subject: need help with possible virus (PC)

Greetings all,
I have had a strange occurance happen to a new pc that I am setting
up in a classroom. The pc came with Windows and Dos 6.0. Another group
at my work has setup NCSA 2.3 for tcp/ip operation, and I was setting
up our Novell access software. While editing one of the batch commands,
MFE (my favorite editor) had experienced one of the keys to change.
Specifically, the escape key began to print one of the upper ascii characters,
I am not sure what the ascii number is. However, I couldn't do anything
like save or abort, all I could do was reboot the PC. The pc rebooted
OK and I could still access the tcp/ip and novell hosts OK. But when
I try to go in to Windows, it fails. So I run my favorite file manager,
XTgold and I see a strange file in the Windows directory. The file name
begins with the strange character that my escape key turned into then
the music symbol then press.ent (**press.ent). This file has read only
and system attributes. I ran Norton disk doctor which showed my FAT
was hosed up, then promptly locked up. I can't exactly remember what
the NDD message was. I ran chkdsk which showed about 1100 crosslinked
files. One of the files that is hosed is msdos.sys. My question is obviously
have I experienced a virus, if so which one, and how do I clean it. The
machine still boots up, however, I cant get rid of **press.ent and when
I run XTgold, it shows subdirectories with the music symbol. I humbly
await your advice.

Well, how do you suppose DOS manages its filing system? If well-written,
code to give read-only access to a DOS drive without using DOS is likely
to be much *faster* than DOS. There's a lot less work to be done, and much
less housekeeping -- no writes to worry about, for a start.<<

Well, his point was that if I were to try and trace (in reverese) the ownership
of each sector, it would result in a slower scan.... and he`s correct.  However
what he (and you, apparently) does not know is that my design (on paper) does
not intend to do that. The only time the scanner I`m designing would bother to
look up the ownership of the file is when it finds a string matching one in the
virus table.

The reason for this design is that you are also correct; scanning without going
through DOS has the potential for going FASTER, (with certain provisos, of
course) and, as suggested, also will not infect as it goes.

>>Sure, it would be incompatible with all the not-straight-DOS implementations
of DOS drives around (emulators, compressed drives, networks...). So, in
those cases, use the regular DOS calls to talk to the filing system.<<

Note my earlier response on being limited to standard solutions to non-standard
problems, because of weird iron.

There is no need to check for the DOS version. A program working at
sector-level would most likely not work very well with OS/2 and
Windows-NT. Since the low-level support on these platforms are not
sufficient to do "safe" sector reading the same way you do in DOS. A
different program would be needed for running under OS/2 and Windows-NT.

But, talking about future DOS compatibility is something else. The
type of filesystem (FAT/HPFS/NTFS/etc) is described in a one-byte
field in the partition-table (contained in the HD's first sector). And
as long as your program is able to read at sector-level, it should
have no problems finding out what kind of file system it is dealing
with, and use different routines for the different file systems.

To handle the low-levels of HPFS and NTFS may not be as easy as
handling the FAT filesystem. So programs like TBScan might have to
tell the user that only FAT partitions may be scanned in a low-level
manner.

Hi gangs.

I allways supposed that Virstop.EXE from the F-Prot package was capable
of detecting diskettes infected with a boot sector virus, even a simple
one:  Stoned.

VShield shows a message when I issue a DIR command over an infected disk,
but Virstop does not say anything.  F-Prot.EXE identifies it correctly.

Is this a bug?  Or a feature (just because boot sector viruses do not
get active when a DIR command is issued)?

I've already fixed the problem. HS is currently at v3.5 and the decryption
routine has been changed to avoid false positives from SCAN 106-109.

HS v3.5 (or 3.6) will probably be available on the InterNet before christmas.
I just want to verify that the new Int_10 MBR infector doesn't trick v3.5
before I release it ;-)

If you take the trouble to handle the low-levels of the FAT
filesystem, you must of course also take the trouble to handle sector
reading and writing in a similarly "secure" manner. This would be
accomplished by calling the ROM BIOS handler for INT 13h directly, or
by writing to the ports of the harddisk controller (good luck :-0). It
will make things even more complicated, but it is nothing the average
antivirus programmer can't handle (right? :-)).

Subject: F-PROT 2.10 now available (PC)

I just uploaded F-PROT anti-virus, version 2.10 to my primary distribution
site (oak.oakland.edu), and to garbo.uwasa.fi as well.  The file should be
available for download on Monday, November 22nd.

This new version adds detection and identification (and in most cases
disinfection) of a record number of new viruses - over 500 new ones
since version 2.09f was released two months ago.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

>From the NEW.210 file:

Version 2.10 - major changes:

   We have re-designed the method F-PROT deals with new variants of
   known viruses.  Previously it would always refuse to disinfect a
   virus, even if it was only slightly different from a variant it
   recognized.  Now it will attempt to determine if the new variant
   is sufficiently similar to a known variant to attempt disinfection,
   using the same method as for the known one.  We still would like to
   ask F-PROT users to send us samples of all viruses that are reported
   as new, modified or unknown variants.

Version 2.10 - the following problems were found and corrected:

   2.09 occasionally missed samples of the Tremor and Phoenix.2000 viruses -
   fixed now.

   When disinfecting certain viruses, such as Jerusalem from .COM files,
   F-PROT would not retain the date/time of the file, but instead set
   it to the current date/time.  Fixed.

   If F-PROT was run twice in a row from interactive mode, and found some
   viruses on the first pass, it would occasionally claim the MBR was
   infected on the second pass.

   F-PROT would only search for user-defined patterns in boot sectors in
   "Quick" mode, not in "Secure" - it should have been the other way around.

   Version 2.09 could not reliably disinfect the "Monkey.B" virus - it was
   handled correctly on 360K diskettes, but just reported as new or modified
   variant of Stoned otherwise.

Version 2.10 - minor improvements and changes:

   We have significantly increased the use of "exact" identification
   of viruses, where F-PROT uses a 32-bit checksum to distinguish
   between very similar variants.  This is one of the explanations
   for the extremely large number of new variants listed below.

Version 2.10 - new viruses:

   The following 58 viruses are now identified, but can not be removed as
   they overwrite or destroy infected files.  Some of them were detected by
   earlier versions of F-PROT, but only reported as "New or modified
   variant of..."

Subject: 1.2 Getting Started (CVP)

BEGPAN4.CVP  931015

                       1.2 - Getting Started

You likely have more resources than you realize.  First of all, your
own observations.  If you can keep cool, and not panic, you can
probably note and recall more than you think.  Don't consider this
as a potential loss of your accounts receivable, look at it as a
detective story.  Look for the clues.

Get some paper and a writing implement.  (Pen, pencil, sharp piece
of coal: in this situation, who's fussy?)  You will want to be as
accurate and detailed as possible.  Most crimes aren't solved by
"Elementary, my dear Watson," cerebrations, but by "Just the facts,
ma'am," deliberations.  Start writing now.  What type of computer is
it?  What operating system?  What version of the operating system?
What happened?  (In detail.)

Now start to inventory your resources.  First, you want anything
that can tell you about this machine.  Do you have invoices with
details of the machine such as the operating system and version?
Invoices for the software?  Was a file created for this machine?
Have you got a file listing from the last time anything was added to
it?  What *was* the last thing added to it?  Have you got a file
listing from when it was first set up?  Have you got a recent
backup?  (You do?  Fortunate mortal!)

Next, look for software that can tell you things about the present
state of the machine.  You do have some.  There is a fair amount the
operating system itself can tell you.  How much disk space is left?
Has that changed a lot?  Memory is a *very* important factor.  The
Mac system info will tell you what programs are using how much
memory.  The MS-DOS CHKDSK program will tell you not only about the
disk space and other interesting things, but also about the "total
memory," which can sometimes pinpoint specific viral programs.  If
you have MS-DOS 5 or higher, MEM/C can give you a *lot* of
information.  Even if you can't use it, people you call on for help
might be able to.

Do you have utility or disk tool programs?  These can also give you
valuable information.  Both commercial and shareware utilities can
help here.  If the computer is still working reasonably well, look
at the memory statistics.  Look at the files.  Are there a lot of
hidden files?  Are there a lot of new files?  Are there a lot of
files with very close "creation dates"?  Look at the disk boot
sector, and the master boot record.  There should be some common
system messages there.  If you don't see them, or see some odd
messages, that's an indication, too.

Are you writing all this down?  Or, if the printer is still working,
printing the screen to save all the data?  (Starting to feel less
panicked?  Yes, you usually feel better when you have something to
do.)

Please send updated versions of antivirals to Rob Slade at 3118 Baird Road,
North Vancouver, BC, Canada, V7K 2G6.  Please note that all shipments from
outside of Canada should state very clearly that the material is for evaluation
and has no commercial value.  In addition, it is advisable to declare a media
cost of $1 per disk and an "intellectual property" value of $1 per item such
that the total does not exceed $15.  Neither Rob Slade nor V.I.R.U.S. take any
responsibility for shipments delayed or refused at Customs for failure to
follow these directions.

Subject: Administrative: Call for volunteers

VIRUS-L/comp.virus readers:

As you're all aware, there are several ongoing activities that are
made available to this group, such as the Frequently Asked Questions
(FAQ) list, the archive site maintenance, etc.  Most of these are
"background tasks" that people have volunteered to work on over the
years.  I'm personally finding less and less time to devote to these
things, so I'd like to solicit volunteers to spearhead a couple of
these things.

Specifically, I'm looking for volunteers to do each of the following:

- - Update and maintain the FAQ sheet.
- - Coordinate and post product reviews.
- - Maintain an anonymous FTP area containing the VIRUS-L/comp.virus
  archives (i.e., back issues, documents, reviews).

If anyone would like to take on any or all of these tasks, please let
me know.  Unfortunately, all that I can offer in return is my
gratitude, and due credit on all of the work.  I can also guarantee
that you'll meet plenty of interesting people.

Thanks,

Ken
