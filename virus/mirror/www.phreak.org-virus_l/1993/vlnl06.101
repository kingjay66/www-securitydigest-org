Program: TechNation ... Americans & Technology
Release: July 7, 1993
Content: Virus/Anti-Virus

On this week's "TechNation ... Americans & Technology," hosted by
Dr. Moira Gunn:

     Moira interviews Urnst Kouch, publisher of the "Crypt Newletter,"
an electronic newsletter for computer virus writers, anti-virus 
writers, and the computer security industry.  The discussion describes 
computer viruses, how to gain access to underground networks in order
to collect libraries of virus code, how to place your virus, and, 
from a virus writer's standpoint, how susceptible a user is to viruses.

     In the second half, Moira speaks with John McAfee, founder and CEO
of McAfee Associates, the leading manufacturer of anti-virus software.
McAfee describes the techniques that anti-virus software uses, who should
have anti-virus software, whether the publication of virus code should
remain legal, and how the anti-virus writers stay ahead of the virus
writers.

     Network connectivity for Internet Talk Radio is provided by 
UUNET Technologies.  Support for "local" broadcast of TechNation is
made possible by Sun Microsystems and by O'Reilly & Associates.

Subject: Arj-virus? (PC)

Hi! I use Arj verision 2.41 (The best). Well, i have a memory-resident
program, that says if files are being changed. Everytime i access .exe
files that belong to arj the program warns me that the file has
changed.  Has this happened to you? Will you test the problem?

Ok....write to this article if you find out something....

Thanks!

Subject: SatanBug infection (PC)

I'm trying to disinfect a machine that appears to have come down with
the [SatanBug] virus.  At least this is what McAfee Scan v106 reports.
Unfortunately v106 of Clean doesn't seem to be able to rid my .exe and
com files of this menace.  The name [SatanBug] also does not appear in
the VIRLIST.TXT file.  Anybody had any experience eradicating this pest?

It sounds like you may have an unknown stealth infector. I would 
deffinately recommend for you to send some of the affected files to a virus 
researcher for study.

1. I am running DOS 6.0 as well, and I have not experienced any problems 
other than DBLSPACE. ;-) 
3. If there is a stealth infector resident, the filesize will remain the 
same. One quick way to find out for certain would be to copy some of the 
affected files to diskette, then take that diskette to an unaffected 
machine, and view the directory of the diskette. If the files are larger 
than they are supposed to be, it's a safe bet that a virus is present.
5: It deffinately sounds like a fully stealthed virus that is capable of 
disinfecting the host files when they are opened for any reason. When you 
uploaded the files, the virus could have disinfected the host files prior 
to the upload process, and re-infected them after the host files were 
closed.
6: Try F-Prot 2.08a. It is a very good scanner, and it can detect new or 
modified variants that other scanners may miss.
7: I haven't heard of a new stealth virus that only infects .EXE files, but 

it's possible.

I hope it helps.

I had a similar problem with my A: drive and it turned out that the cable
had worked loose a bit and wasn't making good contact.  Open the case and
make sure that the controller and power cables are tightly connected.  Try
switching the cables (and CMOS) to make the the A: into B: and vice versa.
If they both work switched, then switch back again and try again.  That
should isolate any drive or controller problems.

Subject: Re: Tremor (PC)

You needed Informations about TREMOR :

        Name      : TREMOR
        Original  : Germany
        Known since march 1993
        infects   : EXE und COM
        SCANNER   : F-PROT 2.07+ finds it
                    TREMEX,TFIND.
        CLEANER   : TBCLEAN cleans it
                    TREMEX Scans for and cleans it
                    TFIND scans for and cleans it


    infected files grow 4000 byte
    the files date is set to year:=(old-year+100)
    intercepts int 21h,15h,9,24h

    Tremor-self-recognition :

        MOV     AH,2Ah
        int     21h
        MOV     AH,30h
        INT     21H
        MOV     AX,0F1E9H
        INT     21H
        CMP     AX,0CADEh
        JE      _tremor_im_speicher

    the virus is polymorphic with a build-in code generator.
    you cannot find a classical scanstring.


    tremor starts trying to get upper memory and to copy itself to this region.
    first tries the DOS-way then the XMS-way.

    it traces to int21-entry

    it patches the master-psp in such a way, that on every termination of a 
program the commandinterpreter itself gives control to the resident virus.
    it always tries first to infect the commandinterpreter as defined in 
COMSPEC.
    the computer seems to be "lame" with tremor in memory, everything needs 
more time.

    CHKDSK always shows the correct numbers.
    If CLEAN,SCAN,MEM,CHKDSK,F-PROT,MIRROR,SYS,HB*,SI,ARJ is started then 
these files will be desinfected ON THE HARDDISK == physically.

    if a scanner runs, the opend files are "desinfected" in RAM.


    it extensively looks for VIRSTOP/VIREX and tries to refuse any actions, 
that could cause warnings.

    it simply switches "OFF" vsafe/mcvsafe.

    you cannot detect an infected file if tremor is actice.
    what you can do is : perform its selftest :)

    the filesystem itself is not attacked by tremor (no FAT-attacks, no writes 
directly to any sektor). it infects only files _as_ files.

    pressing ctrl_alt_del may simetimes result in displaying the following 
text         -=> T.R.E.M.O.R was done by NEUROBASHER / May-June'92, Germany <=-

                   .MOMENT.OF.TERROR.IS.THE.BEGINNING.OF.LIFE.

    the text will be moved some bits in a circle (frequest DEMOVIR.EXE to see 
it). after this it will reboot. this text is separately encrypted.

    to find the virus in memory you can use the following sequence of chars :

        "CHMEMIF2F-SYSIPMRJKZAH"

    these are frgments of filenames who are handled specially by tremor (
desinfection).

    desinfections are made with every "open-file"-command with AH=3D02.
    closing the file will result in  re-infection.

    you can frequest this report in german as TREMOR.RPT at my bbs.
    you can frequest TREMEX*.* at my bbs, too.
    I wrote an additional scanner : TFIND.EXE (same bbs :)

    greetings, stop this beast :)

Subject: Re: FORM virus (PC)

In reply to Yves Riedrich's request for help with the FORM virus:

I hate to keep bringing this up, but cleaning software is bogus!  You
do not I repeat NOT need it, and it does NOT, I repeat NOT work 100%
of the time.  Yves problem is an example of this.  Okay, so you have
FORM, now what do you do?  Well, FORM is a DOS Boot sector virus
meaning that if you reboot the system from a clean DOS diskette with
the same version of DOS as that of the infected computer and execute
the SYS C: command, this will wipe it out since FORM will be
overwriten by a new DOS Boot sector.  That's it!  You're done!

Since I am on the soap-box, let me go on for a bit more on the topic
of cleaning software.  Most cleaning software will clean a specific
known virus from a hard disk or program file.  There are some that do
generic cleaning, and this is preferred, but still not worth it.
Let's look at some examples in defense of my position.

Your hard disk becomes infected with FORM, you try to use cleaning
software after re-booting the system from a clean DOS disk, and the
cleaning software fails.  If you knew about the virus, then you could
have simply run sys to clean the system once and for all.

Your hard disk becomes infected with the Michelangelo virus, you
reboot from a clean DOS diskette and (if running DOS 5.0 or above) you
run FDISK /MBR and viola, the virus is dead!  Again, nothing up my
sleeves, and no cleaning software.

Your hard disk becomes infected with an unknown MBR or DOS boot sector
virus.  Cleaning software doesn't know what to do, or if it does it
only performs a FDISK /MBR or SYS command respectively anyway so why
not do it yourself?

Your hard disk becomes infected first with Stoned and then with
Michelangelo (don't laugh, it's happened more than once as Virus-l can
attest).  Your system becomes non-bootable.  Upon scanning the
hard-drive, you find that it is infected with Michelangelo (no, not
Stoned and Michelangelo, just Michelangelo) so you clean it for
Michelangelo.  The cleaning software knows where the Michelangelo
virus puts the old MBR so it copies it from that location without
checking to see whether it's even valid.  You try to reboot, the
system still hangs, when you re-scan it, what a surprise, you find
that you are infected with Stoned and the cleaning software is unable
to clean it.  Eventually, you have enough sense to run FDISK /MBR and
your system is functional again.

A program becomes infected with a virus.  Who cares what it is?  Not
me, since I simply reboot from a clean DOS disk, run a CRC and delete
any programs which have changed and should not have.  I replace the
erased programs from originals or clean back-ups and I'm done.  I
don't care if the virus is MtE, TPE, Phoenix or King Kong's
Illegitimate Love Child, it's dead, gone, kaput!  No doubt, and no
cleaning software.

You get a program that is infected with two viruses, your scanner
detects the latest infection, you clean the program of this virus, and
you still have the other virus to contend with.  If you had deleted
the file and replaced it from a clean backup you'd be done by now, but
instead you have to repeat the whole process over and over again.

You get another program that is infected with a virus recognized as
the BOGUS virus.  You clean the program using cleaning software,
unfortunately, the virus was a varient of the BOGUS virus that the
cleaning software does not know about and it trashes the file.  You
end up erasing it and replacing it with a clean back-up.

Last example, you get a virus, the scanner identifies it, the cleaning
software attempts to clean it and thinks it has done so successfully.
The program will not run, however, when you attempt to run it.  So you
end up erasing it and replacing it from an original.

Is the light-bulb beginning to go on?  Any cleaning of viruses from
other than the MBR and DOS boot sector is a decision made under
uncertainty.  So why not be certain and do it right the first time?
Cleaning software?  Just say NO!

P.S. If you still want to buy some cleaning software, I'll be glad to
sell you a copy!  In the words of P.T. Barnum ...

  ** NOTE: July 10 is the deadline for discounted registration!! **

			  PRELIMINARY AGENDA
	   5th Computer Security Incident Handling Workshop
Sponsored by the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST)

			  August 10-13, 1993
			    St. Louis, MO


TUESDAY, August 10, 1993  Full-day Tutorials

1.  Creating a Security Policy
    presented by Charles Cresson Wood:

      [no abstract available at time of posting]

2.  Vulnerabilities of the IBM PC Architecture: Virus, Worms, Trojan
      Horses, and Things That Go Bump In The Night
    presented by A. Padgett Peterson:

  An intensive look into the architecture of the IBM-PC and MS/PC-DOS --
  What it is and why it was designed that way. An understanding of
  assembly language and the interrupt structure of the Intel 80x86
  processor is helpful.

  The day will begin with the BIOS and what makes the PC a fully
  functional computer before any higher operating system is introduced.
  Next will be a discussion of the various operating systems, what they
  add and what is masked. Finally, the role and effects of the PC and
  various LAN configurations (peer-peer and client server) will be
  examined with emphasis on the potential protection afforded by login
  scripting and RIGHTS.

  At each step, vulnerabilities will be examined and demonstrations made
  of how malicious software exploits them. Demonstrations may include
  STONED, MICHELANGELO, AZUSA, FORM, JERUSALEM, SUNDAY, 4096, and EXEBUG
  viruses depending on time and equipment available.

  On completion attendees will understand the vulnerabilities and how to
  detect attempted exploitation using simple tools included with DOS
  such as DEBUG and MEM.

3.  Unix Security
    presented by Matt Bishop:

  Unix can be a secure operating system if the appropriate controls and
  tools are used.  However, it is difficult for even experienced system
  administrators to know all the appropriate controls to use.  This
  tutorial covers the most important aspects of Unix security
  administration, including internal and external controls, useful
  tools, and administration techniques to develop better security.

  Upon completion, Unix system administrators will have a better understanding
  of vulnerabilities in Unix, and of methods to protect their systems.
