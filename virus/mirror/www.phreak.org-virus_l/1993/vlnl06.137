The specific purpose is to update my information for a workshop being
sponsored by the NCLS (National Conference of Lawyers and Scientists),
and the AAAS (American Association for the Advancement of Science),
entitled "Legal, Ethical and Technological Aspects of Computer and
Network Use and Abuse".  The focus of the workshop will be on ways in
which the law, ethics, and technology can contribute to shaping the
bounds of acceptable behavior in shared computing environments.

I have received a lot of mail via other nets, requesting information
about admission to the conference, etc.  Since this is a very large
network :), let me say here that this is an invitational conference.
However, according to the documentation I have received, the Proceedings
will be published, and findings disseminated through various means,
including symposia, articles in popular media, and seminars for
policymakers, educators and computer users.

Again, thanks to everyone for the responses so far!

I've gotten several responses to this effect and, while I don't want
to go round and round on the question for days, I'd like to say
just one more time that as far as I know we have *no* evidence
that the lack of protection mechanisms in the PC world has anything
to do with the fact that viruses have spread there.  Numerous
people have by now demonstrated that there's no *technical*
barrier to viruses spreading quite merrily around in Unix systems
*without* finding or exploiting any security holes.  They can
simply spread through *authorized* channels (from programs
that I'm allowed to run to programs that I'm allowed to write
to), of which there are quite a few on any real-life system.

So, while it's very easy to say "well, Unix system have security /
access control / permission bits / whatever, and this will make
it harder to write a virus", I don't think we have any evidence
that it really *will* make it harder.  Viruses can spread anyway,
through authorized channels.  Another way to look at it: most
PCs are still standalone machine even these days: there's *no*
way for a virus on one machine to get to another machine unless
someone intentionally carries or transmits something from one
to the other.  All a virus can do is spread within a single
machine, and hope someone will carry / send an infected object.
And that works!  We have lots of infected PCs.  In the same
way, even if all a virus can do in Unix is infect the programs
that it currently has authority to write to, and hope that eventually
one of those will be executed in another administrative domain,
that might well be enough to lead to a Unix virus problem, if
the culture of program sharing were sufficient.

We're probably all agreeing with each other loudly here, but
I like to raise a little red flag whenever anyone casually
implies that things like access controls have to be broken
before a virus can spread...

Vesselin:

Wouldn't it be better to copy all .COM and .EXE files to non executable
extensions?

This would speed up the process greatly.

Of course Hard drive space may be critical, and they would not be able to use
this trick.

I used .CVM, and .EVE as the non executable extensions when I needed to get
rid of an accidental FRODO infection about a year ago.

I selected the extensions above because I didn't want to confuse .COM files
for .EXE files and vice versa.

Neither of the tricks will work unless the users have a write protected
bootable diskette available.

Some weeks ago, Stephen Joseph Smith <sjsmith@cws.UMD.EDU> wrote about a
possible DOS/Windows virus, as a result of an oddly worded letter from
Stephanie LaMarca of Cheyenne Software to Great Game Products.

CompLink is a systems integration company that has a very close
relationship with Cheyenne Software.  As CompLink is installing a mission
critical system here, I asked one of their Vice President's, Mark Spinner,
to follow up on the letter with Cheyenne Software.  Eventually, I received
the following response from Andrew Boyland, Director for Security Products,
of Cheyenne Software.

"Ms. Stepanie LaMarca was employed by Cheyenne as a summer intern.
Her primary responsibilities included the development of a software
inventory module of our network monitoring products.  To that end,
Ms. LaMarca was collecting certain information from software vendors to
help her develop this module.  I apologize if her letter seemed suspicious
and can assure you that Cheyenne maintains the highest ethical standards
in the industry.  For your reference, Ms. LaMarca's internship ended
about 3 weeks ago."

Subject: Satan Bug (Virus alert) (PC)

The following was found on our internal network this morning:

- -=-=-=
The following is from the October 11, 1993 issue of Network World:

Vendors of antivirus software are scrambling to update their products
to cope with the Satan Bug, an encrypted, polymorphic virus that is
attacking government computer systems.

The subject of a recent alert from the DOE virus watch, group called
Computer Incident Advisory Capability (CIAC), Satan Bug is described
as particularly difficult to battle because it is encrypted.  Satan
Bug can render files inoperable, change dates, and shut users out of
LANs by damaging LAN interface drivers.

(It attacks DOS computers, damages .COM, .EXE, .SYS, AND .OVE files
and makes LANs inaccessible by damaging LAN drivers)

: :  :

The CIAC bulletin noted that encrypted viruses like the Satan Bug are
particularly difficult to remove from an infected program.  Encrypted
viruses attach themselves to a computer program, capture a small piece
of the program and replace it with virus code.  The virus then
encrypts itself along with the captured piece of program.

*For an antivirus program to be able to patch an infected program, it
must be able to decrypt the encrypted virus to find the piece of
missing code so that it can be put back where it belongs.  The Satan
Bug has up to nine levels of encryption, the level being different for
each infection.*, the CIAC bulletin stated.

The encryption will also make the virus invisible to antivirus
scanners dated before August.  *Virus scanners must open a file to
scan it, and if your virus is in memory, the act of opening it for
scanning will infect it.  And, if you run an infected antivirus
scanner, nearly every executable file on the disk will be infected.:

. based on its sophistication the Satan Bug is probably the work of a
20-year old American male (as opposed to a mischievous 14 year old).

 *Satan Bug is a complicated virus, and it9s hard to detect*, said
Roger Thompson, president of Marietta, Ga-based Leprechan Software,
Inc., *It has an encryption / decryption loop, and it decrypts itself
by using a key anywhere between 40 and 2,000 bits long.:

 Question: Why are "popular `industry-known' " virus scanners such as
McAfee's ViruScan, CPAV and NAV so slow to adopt heuristics when it's
proven to be THE best method of virus detection...

 It's a REAL SHAME that products such as Thunderbyte and FProt aren't as
popular as otherwise lame and overrated products such as the
"industry-known" scanners.

 Just a comment. I've been out of the scene for about 5 months and
noticed that things haven't changed much...

 Can anyone reading this from the big companies explain why you are so
behind everything and giving your customers a sub-standard product and

Subject: Odd problem on 486 (PC)

Hello!

Several machines at a computer lab at our university are experiencing
a strange problem and I was wondering if anyone has seen anything
similar or has any clues as to how to solve it.

The machines are all DECpc 466d2LP with 245M hard disks and 8M of RAM.
They are all running DOS 6.0 with the compression utility
de-activated.

Last week, a user noticed that one of the data files created by the
ap- plication Constats (a statistics program) had been set to 0 bytes
in the directory listing. It has previously contained several thousand
bytes of data but is now unusable by the program.

A few days later, the entire directory listing for Mystat (another
stat package) had been converted into a file of 0 bytes and the
application will not run, ("file not found").

Shortly thereafter, the same thing happened to the entire directory
for WordPerfect. It had been converted to one unusable file.

The problem is consistent in that it always happens on the same
machines at the same time. So that all of the machines lost the
Constats data, then the Mystat, etc. together.

Norton Utilities found no lost chains or clusters. Norton Anti-Virus
hasn't turned up any known viruses although we are going to try other
anti-virus packages to see if they might find anything. Since this is
a public lab, it is very possible that someone has simply been
tampering with the files. But because the problem is so systematic and
unusual (as opposed to someone simply deleting the files), this seems
unlikely.

Could this be something specific to DOS 6.0/DEC? A new virus?  Any
ideas and suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Please send
replies via e-mail to:

I'll let somebody else reply regarding SCAN, but for F-PROT the status is as
follows:

    The last version we "officially" distributed was 2.09f, which was
    sent out earlier this month.  I had also given a gopy to a few people
    at the Amsterdam VB conference last month - the only significant
    difference is that the file describing new features was named NEW.210
    by mistake in that version.  We sent 2.09f by mail to all our
    subscribers, as 2.10 was behind schedule.

    Internally we are up to 2.09h, but 2.10 will be released later this month.

I lost my hard disk, it just died.  The h.d. was under warranty and
when I installed the h.d., i noticed the company had already put dos

utilities (which was nice of them, since the same programs came with
the computer I originally purchased from this company).  Sadly, the

I believe that she is trying to say that the virus appends it's code
to the end of the file that is being infected, as opposed to, for
example, prepending the file (like Jerusa-lame .COM infections), or
overwriting the infected file, etc..

Sorry, but wrong.  What about the AT we have at work where the first HD
partition is E:--Yes, E:.  Boots fine, gets MBR infections just as it
should, etc, etc.  Because of the multitude of hardware installation and
setup options, referring to a HD partition by its DOS name is next to
meaningless when discussing MBR infectors (and possibly some/most OSBR
infectors ?).

I know people are probably getting sick of me repeating this, -but-
there are still machines out here with such "peculiarities".  No, I do
not need yet another explanation of how this all works--I know it.  The
issue really is that saying, for example, in reference to hard disks
that "Stoned can only be on drive C:" is, has always been and will
continue to be, incorrect.  The point where it is -useful- to use such
terminology in a public forum where a huge range of systems knowledge is
represented and the point where it gets in the way of a (semi-)technical
discussion of a particular virus is something contributors here should
pay more careful attention to.

As an additional note to Vesselin's comments on Ludwig's Timid, a buggy

supposedly in the wild.

Sent a copy, along with my commented disassembly and the bugs noted, to

dismissed it as "probably an escaped researchvirus", being unaware of Mr.

Parasites usually can't live for very long without their hosts, and since
file infectors require host files in order for them to replicate, they are
parasitic.

Horng,

if you are referring to the ANTIX Trojan, just have it deleted from the
file server: nobody in their right minds would ever want to use it.

If you are, however, refer to ANTHRAX virus, watch out: this is a
multipartite virus that infects COM and EXE files, and the MBR.
Replace all infected files with clean copies, and clean the MBR (if
infected) as reported earlier in VIRUS-L.

ap- plication Constats (a statistics program) had been set to 0 bytes
in the directory listing. It has previously contained several thousand
bytes of data but is now unusable by the program.

A few days later, the entire directory listing for Mystat (another
stat package) had been converted into a file of 0 bytes and the
application will not run, ("file not found").

Shortly thereafter, the same thing happened to the entire directory
for WordPerfect. It had been converted to one unusable file.

The problem is consistent in that it always happens on the same
machines at the same time. So that all of the machines lost the
Constats data, then the Mystat, etc. together.

Norton Utilities found no lost chains or clusters. Norton Anti-Virus
hasn't turned up any known viruses although we are going to try other
anti-virus packages to see if they might find anything. Since this is
a public lab, it is very possible that someone has simply been
tampering with the files. But because the problem is so systematic and
unusual (as opposed to someone simply deleting the files), this seems
unlikely.

Could this be something specific to DOS 6.0/DEC? A new virus?  Any
ideas and suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Please send
replies via e-mail to:

NOTE: Frans is (as far as I know) not able to read USENET. However, he
      could well be on the virus-l list. I don't know.
      If you want to be sure he reads your mail, email him personally !

And now the answer to the question about the alse alarm:
Yes it has been fixed in v6.07. I just got an E-mail from Frans telling me
this. He also told me that the newwest version will be available in about
two weeks.
And I just got a new chance of uploading tbav607.zip, tbavu607.zip and
tbavx607.zip (eg the complete, update and optimized versions) to SimTel
(thanks to Keith !!)
They should be available soon (for those of you who don't have ftp and just
have a mirror of one or two sites).

So does IBM AntiVirus, at least in some cases, and I disagree that
it's necessarily a "mistake".  It's a tradeoff: following your rule
would decrease certain kinds of false alarms, but it would also
mean that (say) a Jerusalem variant that loaded in higher memory,
or a Tiny variant that loaded elsewhere would be missed, whereas
it might otherwise have been detected.  Each manufacturer, in
partnership with the customers, has to decide where the right
balance is.  From what I've seen in our customer set, this
particular kind of "paranoid" behavior seems to be what the
customers want, at least in many cases.   Of course, it should
probably be an option (hehe), but too many options also
lead to confusing and/or wrongly-used programs...

Subject: "Killer Mime" virus - what detects it, and can it be removed? (PC)

Subject pretty well says it.  Which products will detect Killer Mime,
or is there a way to positively detect and identify it through DOS
utilities?  Is there a disinfectant method for hard disk infection
other than low-level reformat?

Thanks in advance.

We are all glad to see Jimmy Kuo's response to Jeff rice's message showing
that NAV 3.0 now handles MTE encrypted viruses correctly. I would be
interested in hearing if Symantec now has the capability to identify
the newer polymorphs (TPE,Satanbug,etc.) and how they are preparing to
deal with others not yet in the field?

WHAT'S NEW

     Version 5.54B108 ("108-B") of VSHIELD fixes the following
problems from the prior release.

o     VSHIELD displaying a "This program requires
      Microsoft Windows" message when the /SWAP and
      /WINDOWS switches are used together.

o     VSHIELD /ACCESS, /BOOT, or /COPY exiting Windows
      when a virus was found.

o     VSHIELD failing to load if more than 768 bytes
      of system environment space is used.

o     VSHIELD /CF {filename} falsely reporting that
      files have been modified when run with QEMM by
      Quarterdeck.

VALIDATE VALUES

     The validation results for the VSHIELD 5.54B108
should be:

FILENAME:     SIZE:      DATE         CHECK METHOD:
VSHIELD.EXE   S:52,113   D:10-07-93   M1: 4547  M2: 120D

NOTE:  Only the VSHIELD.EXE file has been changed.  All
       other .COM and .EXE files remain the same from the
       prior release.

Subject: fp-209f.zip - Version 2.09f of the F-PROT anti-virus package (PC)

I have uploaded to the SimTel Software Repository (available by anonymous
ftp from the primary mirror site OAK.Oakland.Edu and its mirrors):

pub/msdos/virus/
fp-209f.zip     Version 2.09f of the F-PROT anti-virus package

The reason this version is called 2.09f instead of 2.10 is that some major
changes were planned for 2.10, but that version is behind schedule.  In
order to keep F-PROT users up-to-date with respect to virus detection, we
released this version.

Version 2.09f - the following problems were found and corrected:

   When running under OS/2 2.1, version 2.09 and earlier did not recognize
   HPFS file systems, and just reported "Error reading C:", unless boot
   sector scanning was disabled, which unfortunately meant that the
   MBR was not scanned either.

   2.09 was unable to disinfect certain boot sector viruses, such as
   Stoned.NoInt from hard disks, and would simply report "Original MBR
   not found".

   False "Ultimatum" positives were fixed.

Version 2.09f - minor improvements and changes:

   The /TROJAN and /NOTROJAN switches have been eliminated, as searching
   for Trojans does not require any significant extra processing, as it
   used to.  F-PROT will now always search for the Trojans it recognizes
   and report them if found.

   F-PROT now reports which program have been modified by adding the
   Central Point/Turbo Anti-Virus self-check code.  We do not recommend
   adding external integrity checking code to programs, as many programs
   perform their own interlnal self-intecrity check, and will consider the
   added code a virus infection.

Version 2.09f - new viruses:

   The following 21 viruses are now identified, but can not be removed as
   they overwrite or destroy infected files.  Some of them were detected by
   earlier versions of F-PROT, but only reported as "New or modified
   variant of..."

        Australian Parasite.143
        Burger (498, 505, 505.B, 505.C, 505.D, 505.E, 505.F, 509 and 560.K2)
