9MB? You musta been very quick in powering the PC down :-). Ah, joking. Okay, 
it may be possible to recover _something_ in some instances, if Mich didn't 
touch one copy of the FAT or your files weren't too fragmented. You need a big 
bucket of luck to recover "all you want" :-)

Hi Chris!

Yes - get a virus-free DOS 5 boot disk containing FDISK and a sector editor, 
boot from it and issue "FDISK /MBR". If this does not help at all, it means 
your partition table entries have gone, too. In that case take the sector 
editor, look for the DOS bootsectors on your hard disk (if you ever saw an 
intact DOS boot record, you know how it looks like) and insert the right 
parameters into the new-built MBR's partition entries. A little difficult, but 
works.

Subject: Port Writes (PC)

Hello everyone.

A couple of days ago, I first succeeded in compiling and running a routine to 
access disk using port writes only, therefore avoiding any interrupt 
whatsoever.

Needless to say, this piece of code is not going anywhere.

However, this raised a question.

Is there any EXISTING control program to inhibit such access? If a virus were 
to use port writes, no anti-virus shield would be able to stop it.

According to Alan Solomons VENCYCL it "Plays music, or beeps."  It

This is almost never necessary, and will usually cause far more 
trouble than waiting till you can get proper advice.

If VET had been installed on the PC it would have been able to put 
back the saved copy of the DOS boot sector, but as this virus 
infects the DOS boot sector it can readily be removed with the 
command "SYS C:"

In their enthusiasm to protect themselves from every possible risk 
systems administrators often specify security measures which render 
users PCs almost inaccessible.  The inevitable result is that the 
users find some way of disabling the security measures, and so they 
end up having no protection whatsoever.

When we were designing our program VET we started from the 
assumption that if it added more than about 20 seconds to the normal 
startup time it would be disabled, so we set out to provide an 
adequate degree of security without exceeding this limit.  The 
measures we adopted are:

  1.  We made VET as fast as possible.

  2.  During Installation we take copies of both boot sectors, so 
      that any change can be detected.
      
  3.  We record the top of memory, so the user will be warned if 
      a virus goes resident here.
      
  4.  We check memory for known viruses, and then fill unused memory 
      with a diagnostic code, so that if a new virus should hide in 
      memory without protecting itself the PC will lock up, after 
      warning that unused memory has been executed.
      
  5.  We calculate signatures for our program files, after adding 
      the information relating to the users PC, and for COMMAND.COM 
      (or equivalent).  The signatures are embedded in the program 
      files, and these are then encrypted, and new signatures 
      are calculated and recorded.
      
  5.  By default VET will check the first 50 executable files it 
      finds.  Most program viruses will spread rapidly, so this will 
      detect nearly all infections the next time the PC is booted.

Using the default options VET takes about 16 seconds to check an XT, 
and 4 to check a modern 486, but it will identify nearly all viruses 
that are remotely common, recover files and hard disks infected with 
most common viruses, and warn of most infections with new viruses.  

The author of the locally written Gingerbread virus went to 
inordinate lengths to hide it, but if it infected a PC with VET 
installed the user would be warned in the normal boot that the top 
of memory had been changed.  After a clean boot VET would also warn 
that the MBR and the VET file were corrupted.

Subject: Re: Booting password (PC)

Can't you go into the setup program?  I had the same problem with
a DTK 486DX 50Mhz computer:  I could not execute the setup utilities,
because it allways asked me for the setup password.

What I did follows:  I wrote my own setup program (CMOSEDIT.EXE) which
allows me to modify any register in the CMOS.  Particularly, I changed
the hard disk type number to other number and then booted up again.

The DTK BIOS POST routine tried to recognize the new hard disk type
parameters, checking them against the real HD installed.  Of course,
the comparison failed and the POST suggested to get into the setup

Voila... No setup password were asked.  Try it, you can use any CMOS
modifier utility; there are several on InterNet (Mark Aitchison has
written CMOS.EXE version 2.99 which is very good.  FTP for it in
cantva.canterbury.acs.nz under the PC directory, file CMOS299.ZIP,
login as anonymous).

Good luck

Subject: Superstor and McAfee (PC)


 I'm posting this question for a friend.  He has had some problems using
 McAfee and Superstor.  He scanned the files on his Superstor disk, and
 McAfee reported no viruses.  However, he could not access the Superstor disk;
 he could only access the regular disk with the Superstor temporary files.
 Luckily, when he rebooted, all was fine-- he could access his Superstor
 disk and all files were in tact.

 Are there any problems with using Superstor and McAfee?  What may have
 caused his inability to access the Superstor disk?

 Thanks,

I have discovered a bug in FixMBR.EXE v2.7 and 2.7b included in the
FixUtil4.zip file that may trigger an "Sector Mismatch..." error on
some partition tables. This bug does not exist in the 1.x versions
in FixUtil3. I will put together a fix that will be posted as FixUtl4c.zip

Again, this will only occur on certain oddly partitioned PCs in which

The problem is that the Zenith looks at the hard disk entry first.
If the type is NONE (as when a hard card or any disk requiring its own
controller) is in use, it will ALWAYS boot from A: reguardless of the
boot select setting. If this is the case, first check to see if you
can turn the controller BIOS off and use the Zenith BIOS instead (seen
frequently when upgrades from 159s to 248s and 386s occured & the
old disk and controller were kept.

IMHO this is true. A MBR or BSI could still occur with a dropper or if
an insider "helped" but most of the currently "common" viruses of
this type will be stopped.

GENB is McAfee's designation for a generic boot sector infector.  So it is 
not a specific virus.  If it later said Form, then you have Form.

Well, what did you expect?  The startup line shows that the copyright is

Just to see if the CW was right, I tested MSAV on my rather small collection

MSAV caught 308.  Quite a difference!  Microsoft oughta be ashamed...

	Vi-Spy consistently pick the Central Point Antivirus files like 
vsafe.com or Vsafe.sys saying that Flip virus is found.  I think I have used a

I think what you're saying here is that pklite can't expand it, but its pretty
easy to write one that does!(?)  If that is the case there seems to be little
point in using PKLITE Pro!

As an aside, and without giving away any "trade secrets".  Can you use the
compressed programs built-in ability to uncompress itself, or do you have

  You're so right.  Some idiot recently posted on the Fido-Net
  Batchpower echo the debug script for what was described as a tiny
  disk cache program.  At least two users have reported that the
  program trashed their drives, even though it had been scanned.

  Investigation showed that the file was compressed with PKLite
  1.15, and that a hex editor was used to replace the PKLite
  signature with null characters.  This apparently defeated SCAN,
  which treated it as an ordinary file.  After uncompressing the
  file with PKLite, one user said SCAN apparently identified it as a
  virus, though I suspect it's more likely to be a trojan.

  I've saved both the debug script and the related messages in case
  anyone is interested (offer only open to bona fide virus
  reserachers whose names I recognise).

I always use the term 'polymorphic' in a different way to 'encrypting'. What 
you describe under 2) is an encrypting virus, what you mention under 3) is a 
polymorphic one.

Isn't the term 'polymorphic' specifically reserved for viruses who
have their encoder changed along with every copy by exchanging instructions 
etc. in a way that there can be no signature extracted?

tested experimentally, 
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have tested Untouchable against viruses that the scanner couldn't 
detect.
 
Untouchable can detect these new viruses by integrity checking. and was 
able to restore most of the infected files.
 
Untouchable does this by integrity checking.

Also, (this may be related), how do UNTOUCHABLE and other non-scanner
anti-virus programs work?
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have tested Untouchable, and recommend it.
 
With it's use of scanning, resident virus detector, and integrity 
checking, it can detect the presence of new or unknown viruses.

Subject: Which CRC/scanner to use. (PC)

I currently use f-prot/virstop/ and Integrity master on my machine.
(a 386/40 pc).  I was curios if anyone could give me their opinions
as to which scanner would be the best to use.  I have been in a 
high risk group for computer viruses and have found that Integrity 
master's crc checks and f-prot's heuristic scans have done pretty well.

If anyone has opinions on my setup, or could suggest any other
alternatives please mail me.
