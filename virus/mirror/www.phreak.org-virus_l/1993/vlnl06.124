Sorry for the VIRUS-L/comp.virus down-time, folks.  I was away at a
conference, and my network connection back $HOME was less than usable.
I'll try to get the backlog of messages posted asap.

Also, we've been installing some new systems here, and I understand
that some e-mail to me bounced for a short while.  Again, apologies.
The problem appears to be fixed, and e-mail is now flowing as before.
If any of you got bounced messages from me, please re-send.  Please
verify that the correct e-mail address is: krvw@assist.ims.disa.mil.
(My old "agarne" system is going away.)

Thanks for your patience.

Subject: Virus Ad

I was very dismayed to open my October issue of PC Computing and find
an ad for a CD-ROM disc that specifically mentions "Virus Code" (top
half of page 460). While much of the content of the disc would be
considered controvertial, it also included information on "Phreaking"
and "Tone Box Information", the use of which is illegal. I think
anyone that feels their accepting an ad for a disc listing computer
virus code is unnacceptable should send a letter to the editors at:
	PC Computing
	950 Tower Lane, 19th Floor
	Foster City, CA 94404

The only way to influence their decision on whether or not this is
appropriate is to let them know that we feel its not only
inappropriate, its irresponsible (that is, if you feel that way too).

Subject: Virus scanning for Unix (UNIX)

I need to implement virus protection on our Unix machines.  Can
someone suggest a common mechanism for doing that?  A coworker
suggested getting a Workstation to pre-scan software of files about to
be uploaded.  Is this a good approach?  What's the most bullet proof
approach to doing this?  Right now our operator only scans the files
on the PC before the upload.  I just don't think that makes sense
because that doesn't guarantee the files don't contain "Virus for our
HP/UX".  Please help.  Please reply by email as much as possible.
Thanks.

You still need some -hardware- way to allow the ROM change. If it can
be allowed only in software, then a virus could do it. The easiest way
to implement it is as a switch, or more exactly as jumper.

Ah, c'mon, Anthony, I didn't expect -you- to say that... Every
software distributor should ship their software on permanently
write-protected diskettes - so that the users will not involuntarily
infect the original disks... We have enough trouble with those
manifacturers who to not do that. As Roger Riordan mentioned at the
Virus Bulletin conference - the first thing the user must do when
getting new software is not scanning it, not even making a backup copy
of it, but checking whether it is write-protected and to write protect
it if it isn't.

Besides, what you are proposing above is nothing more than a copy
protection scheme. On the top of that, the diskette has to be
protected from copying - otherwise I could make as many copies as I
wish before the installer has had any chances to decryment any
counters... So, you mean that I must not be able to make a backup copy
of the disk? No, thanks. I'm glad that you are not the manifacturer
and if you were, I wouldn't buy your products which are protected this
way... :-)

I guess that Dr. Cohen means that the updater of the ROM must have
some way to AUTHENTIFY that the update is a legitimate one - e.g., one
coming from America Megatrends and not from The Mad Hacker. The most
convenient (and secure) way to do that is with public key
cryptography. Unfortunately, having in mind the patent problems
surrounding this field in the USA, such scheme is unlikely to become
widespread soon...

Why is it totally excessive? How much cost adds a jumper? Is it better
to have the ROM freely changed by software? Doesn't the PC with MS-DOS
have enough security problems already?

[Description of Intel's Flash ROM update procedure deleted to save
bandwidth.]

It is not clear to me how is the ROM address space enabled for update.
Is it through a switch or jumper or is it through writing to a port?
In the latter case, what prevents a virus to do exactly the same?
Hell, it even doesn't need to be in the virus, it could be a dropper
that contains part of that same "init block", uses them to enable the
ROM modification, and then modifies the BIOS to install from time to
time a copy of the Stoned virus on the first hard disk...

Security through obscurity. It never works. How much time it will take
until the hackers disassemble the init block and figure out what it
does?

It certainly doesn't appear so to me... You must physically open those
other PCs and replace a chip; you can't just walk to them with a
floppy, run a magical program and make the BIOS do something
completely different...

Well, you have been wrong, nevertheless... There are several viruses
which attack McAfee Associates' software in one way or another. The
most widespread attack is to avoid to infect it, although it could be
argued that this is not an attack but a surrender... :-) However, some
are not so benign... The Tequila virus removes the checksums added to
the files with the /AV option of scan. (I know at least two people at
McAfee Associates to whom I have explained this; it's strange that you
have not heard about it.) The Jerusalem.2225 virus turns on its
"format the hard disk" switch when a program called SCAN or CLEAN is
run. There are many other examples.

We have it here. The author calls it Lockjaw-zwei (not zwie; "zwei"
means "two" in German); standard CARO name is Prot-T.LockJaw.2. It's a
companion resident virus. It targets several anti-virus products,
meaning that it deletes files with particular names if they are
executed with the virus active in memory. In particular, those names
are:

	*IM.*	(Integrity Master)
	*RX.*	(VirX PC)
	*STOP.*	(VirStop)
	*AV.*	(CPAV, MSAV)
	*PROT.*	(F-Prot)
	*SCAN.*	(SCAN)
	*LEAN.*	(CLEAN)

After deleting the file(s), the virus displays a visual effect.

SCAN 107 seems to have a serious bug, which makes it hang sometimes.
Besides, I have not seen it on the usual archive sites (Simtel20,
Garbo) - only on McAfee's site. I guess that it has not been released
"officially". BTW, SCAN 108 is already out and that one -is- released
officially.

Subject: Removing the Form virus using MSDOS 5.0 SETUP (PC)

I recently suffered an a attack of the Form virus on my machine, a TI
TravelMate. Form inserts itself in the boot sector of disks; in fact, the
infection was traced back to an accidental boot off of a non-system disk
(NB: always check the floppy drives before booting!).

The infection was reported by SCAN 102; however, CLEAN was unable to remove
it. The virus was subsequently removed by booting off the OEM distribution
of MSDOS 5.0 (NOT the retail upgrade), and reinstalling DOS.

My question is: would I have saved myself some time by using FDISK /MBR to
write out a new copy of the boot sector? Or do I have the definitions of the
Master Boot Record and the boot sector mixed up?

     This is not a virus, but a message from Blinker, a popular linker.

     From the Blinker 2.0 documentation:

     <begin>
     Run Rime Error Messages

     1211: overlay manager stack overflow

      The Blinker overlay manager maintains a reload stack used in the
      management of dynamic overlays, and this stack has overflowed.  The
      most common cause of this error is uncontrolled or unintentional
      recursion within an overlaid procedure or function, where a particular
      procedure or function is calling itself repeatedly.
     <end>

     If this is a recurring problem, you should contact your comm program's
     developer and report the error.

     Hope this helps.

Subject: Satan Bug virus (PC)

Recently I have been getting reports of a virus F-prot209d refers to
as the Satan Bug virus locally.  It may be coincidental, but both PC
class systems running Dos 6.0 had problems with keyboard charactors.
In one case, all keyboard entries were switched to upper case only.
In the other case, the "-" key was not recognized.  In the second
case, pkzip 204g would not run either. Again, may be unrelated, as I
do not have any info on Satan Bug.  Has anyone else run into this
virus before.  So far, FP-209D has reported it in one gif file and a
couple of *.pcc files that were part of a game.  While I grant the
files may be false positives, still, FP-209D checked the same files on
another system and showed them clean.

Subject: Tremor Virus and McAfee VIRUSCAN (PC)

In Germany the "Tremor" virus is a widespread virus.

McAfee VIRUSCAN 9.17 V 106 identified - not always - this virus
as "Tremor" with the following entry in VIRLIST.TXT:

Tremor [Tremor]         Clean-Up    . x x x x x x . . .   Varies O P

The new version 9.18 V 107 identifies - more often - this virus now
as "Tremor2" with the following entry in VIRLIST.TXT:

Tremor2 [Tremor2]       Clean-Up    . x x x x x x . . .   Varies O P

The "Tremor"-entry was removed or replaced and there is now only the
"Tremor2" identification.

No other anti-virus product uses and knows a "Tremor2" virus.  We had
a lot of questions, if this is a "special (?)" Tremor variant and what
are the diffences of Tremor and Tremor2.

Question to McAfee Company:
Why uses scan V107 this curios identification name ?

Hi Netters,

	I thought I could trust Central Point Anti-Virus but it did
let me down very badly.... maybe I am too harsh to say this but this
is what I have seen on my computer.............

	My hard disk was infected by V-Sign virus after lending to a
friend.  This virus, I think, creats a copy of it's own BOOT.CPS which
Bootsafe in CPAV uses to check against hard disk boot sector and
partition table.  Needless to say, nothing was reported wrong with
Bootsafe.  I am not sure if this virus is CPAV specific but judging
from the way it behaves, it seems like it is.

	The Virus was detected by f-prot 209d and ViSpy version 11.0.
CPAV failed to recognize anything wrong with MBR and partition table.
The TSR, VSafe did not prevent MBR from being overwritten.

	To my disappointment, CPAV that comes with PCTOOLS v8 and For
windows could not recognized this virus after scanning through it's
database.  It also kind of surprise me that this virus is specifically
designed to work around CPAV.

	I hope some people out there can tell me more about this virus.

	Has anyone tried the newest Version of CPAV... Version 2????

	Many Thanks.

Subject: Hong Kong? (PC)

  Recently, a virus has been discovered in my college's computer lab.
  According to the scanner, it's called Hong Kong.  I haven't touched
  the pc's so I'm just relating what I heard.  The main thing of this
  virus is that if you try to write to a disk, the disk gets completely
  trashed.  Anyone know anything about it?

I've seen cases where someone is using WordPefect, and they load in a file off
an infected disk (or save a file to the disk) and the hard drive that
WordPerfect is on gets infected with the virus. Scary, eh? We used Vshield to
stop that.
