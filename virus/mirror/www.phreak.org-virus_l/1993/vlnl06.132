Actually, the original Dark_Avenger.1800.A virus is quite sloppily

better.

Yes, that was a novel idea at the time. Nowadays we call such viruses
"fast infectors". Dark_Avenger.1800.A was the first fast infector.

I assume that by "a good virus" you mean "a well-written virus", but
even then I can't agree with you. This is definitely not one of the
better written viruses. If you admire tight programming code and lots
of tricks, you should look at Number_of_the_Beast or Dir_II viruses.
If you like a clean and straightforward programming style, which is
easy to follow, you should look at the Eddie-2 virus. I always use
this one when I have to train somebody to disassemble viruses.

they are impossible to catch - there are several scanners that do it

Wrong again!!

(Bad day Rob ??)   8-)

Copy a .com (or .exe for that matter) file which has an obvious but
harmless consequence to a dir on your path (or to the current dir) as
DIR.COM.  Try executing the command "dir.com".  The DOS internal dir
command will run.  (I concede that Rob -may- have meant "specify the
full -path-", in which case he is correct--see above!).

Another test.  Copy two different .exe's or .com's to TEST.EXE and
TEST.COM in the current dir.  Try executing the command "test.exe".

The program copied to TEST.COM will run.

The lessons?

COMMAND.COM checks -first- for a path in the command string, --and-- it
- -ignores- whether you have a filename extension on the command or not.

As I'm here, I'll mention this again.  Those with a bent to hacking
COMMAND.COM might like to look for the string "COMEXEBAT" and modifying
it.  If you replace, say, the "EXE" part with "exe" (and reboot!) none
of your .exe's will run from the command line (COMMAND.COM uppercases
file names in directory entries and does a case sensitive comparison
against its internal list--a similar trick can be used to disable any
internal command such as dir, vol, set, path, etc, etc).  Alternatively,
you may want to change the precedence order to, say, "BATEXECOM" or
change the file extension for .exe's with say "COMEZEBAT" (remember to
rename all your .exe's to .eze!!).

Don't even ask about how batch processing works!    8-)

It is difficult to write a bait file that viruses will attach to.

8tunes refuse to infect anything smaller than 9K.
Zerohunt looks for an area of 0s in the file and plants the virus there. This
is Zero Hunts way of infecting files without an increase in file size.

This is why I use bait files from 2 bytes - 29696 bytes.

If a stealth virus is suspected, or doesn't appear to infect any of my bait
files, I use my little .BAT file (published in Volume 6 issue 100) to see if
the virus is semi stealth, or fully stealthed, but doesn't restore the file
to it's original state. If this routine doesn't report anything, I cold boot
my test machine from a write protected bootable diskette.

I believe there is a current sale of IBM AV/2 for registered OS/2 owners,
reducing the price to some ridiculous level (I think $25 sounds right).  All
I can suggest is contact Indelible Blue (big OS/2 distributor) or call IBM.

What exactly makes you think that the zombie virus has infected your
system?  Some "ps" style utilities for OS/2 label DOS sessions (VDMs) as
"-ZOMBIE-"s because DOS sessions don't register themselves as having names.
If some utility program is telling you that a "-ZOMBIE-" task exists on your
system, it is most likely merely indicating that a DOS program is active.

I agree - unless you have the DOS box open permanently, the zombie virus
could never survive under OS/2.  There's be no DOS API for it to access!

This is the classic symptom of the Cascade family of viruses.  However, the
activation of the virus is very rarely seen since it is supposed to activate
only in the fall of 1988 by the computer's system clock.  This leads me to
suspect that someone is using one of the non-viral "joke" programs that
simulate this effect, without actually duplicating themselves.  Imitations
of Cascade are very common, since the falling letters are so unique.

To be sure it is not the real Cascade virus, you should get hold of a copy
of F-prot via FTP.  Turn your computer off and reboot from a clean diskette.
(Your original DOS disk is a good one to use.)  Unzip F-prot (preferably
using a fresh, new copy of your unzip program) and scan your hard disk.  If
F-prot turns up nothing, check your AUTOEXEC.BAT file for programs that
you did not add-- one of them could be the joke program.  F-prot may even
find it since it does scan for a few of the common "joke" programs.

To help protect yourself in the future, you should install the VIRSTOP.EXE
program that comes with F-prot as part of your CONFIG.SYS.  This will help
keep your computer virus-free, by notifying you before a program infected
with a known virus can be run.

You do not need a virus to play havoc on your disks; standard DOS
suffices to do this bad trick :-(

There has been a severe bug in MS-DOS for at least 4 major versions
(DOS 2 to DOS 5) that exhibits exactly this behaviour under particular
circumstances. It is widely (or is it?) known as "The Critical-Error-
Handler Bug", and works thus:

1. User asks for something to be written on a floppy disk (e.g. save the
   file he/she is editing), but the disk is write-protected.

2. DOS enters its Critical-Error Handler, which displays the notorious
   "Abort, Retry, Ignore" message.

3. User notices that the wrong disk (henceforth "W") is in the drive, and
   replaces it with the disk ("R") he/she had intended to use, then user
   asks the system to go on and "Retry" the writing operation.

4. Now DOS seizes the opportunity to destroy disk R by writing W's FAT
   over R's. This holds even for DOS 5.0, when both R and W have been
   formatted under earlier versions of DOS.

So take my advice: Whenever you are asked the ominous question, choose
the "Abort" option, and start your writing action over again! In this
case, DOS will use the correct FAT from disk R.

Done. However, our TeX installation generates PostScript for Apple
LaserWriter printers. (It even names the files *.dvi-alw, not *.ps.) I
know that PostScript is supposed to be portable, but bear the above in
mind if you have any problems printing it.

NONSENSE! If you don't have the correct knowledge yourself, at least
try not to mislead the other people.

ALL variants of Stoned infect the MBR of the PHYSICAL disk ONLY.
Almost all of them (I'm tempted to say ALL of them) infect the first
physical hard disk ONLY. They usually (I'm tempted to say ALWAYS) do
that ONLY when loaded from a floppy. Almost all of them infect only
floppies in the first physical ploppy disk drive. NO Stoned variant
will ever infect logical drive D:.

What you may refer to is that on computers that use compressed
volumes, the first physical disk APPEARS to be logical drive D:. But
the Stoned viruses infect it at boot time, when it is still physical
drive 80h and nothing else.

> WARNING:  Do not use FDISK/MBR for this.

Just the opposite; FDISK/MBR almost always disinfects correctly the
Stoned viruses. Even, with most of them (and certainly with the most
widespread variant), you can do this with the virus active in memory
and the virus will not reinfect the disk - because it does this only
at boot time. Nevertheless, such practice (letting the virus active in
memory) is strongly discouraged.

> In some situations it will simply delete the partition.

FDISK/MBR will not work only with some encrypted variants of Stoned
(like some members of the Empire group), which either encrypt or
overwrite the whole MBR, including the partition table.

The Beijing virus (or, more exactly, the Stoned.June_4th.* viruses) is
a Stoned variant and as such infects the MBR of the first physical
hard disk. Try booting from a write-protected uninfected MS-DOS 5.0
(or later) system diskette and execute the command FDISK/MBR. This
should remove the virus from your hard disk.

Drive A: is a 3.5" high-capacity drive, right? The error is caused
because the virus trashes the BPB in the boot sector. I think that the
latest version of F-Prot can get around this problem by accessing the
floppy in a physical level, so you should try it. I'm not sure that it
will work, though.

> Nortons Disk Editor also fails with the General failure message.

Try starting it in Maintnance mode (option /m) and read the floppy as
physical sectors.

No. Unlike the Mac, the IBM PC hardware does not provide means to
alert some software component when a diskette is inserted in the disk
drive. The only way to do that would be to have the floppy disk drive
motor constantly running and polling the "diskette changed" status.
Some backup programs do this, but for anti-virus purposes it is not
practical. The closest thing to have is a resident scanner, which
scanns the files as they are copied or executed and alerts the user
if a virus is found in them.

Not quite. What is easy to detect is that -something- is in memory. To
*recognize* that this is Satan_Bug is a bit tricky, because the virus
keeps itself encrypted even in memory.

However, it is also quite likely that the same person will forget the
infected floppy in drive A: while rebooting, which will result in a
hard disk infection. :-( It would be much better if VirStop displayed
a proper warning message, even in a Windows popup window. There are
programs which can do that, so it should be possible.

Another problem I had with VirStop is that I am not able to use it
with DR-DOS. It hangs, or leaves a "hole" in memory when loaded, or
other such problems.

I got it personally form Frisk when we met in Amsterdam and he told me
that it is for distribution. I have also noticed the file with the
wrong name; guess that has been a minor mistake from Frisk's part.
Don't worry, it's a legitimate version.

That's a common mistake about the Form virus - it can be found in
Patricia Hoffman's VSUM and even in our Computer Virus Catalog. The
truth is that the virus activates on the 18th of every month; not on
the 24th. Also, it will activate only on computers with BIOSes that
support INT 1Ah (usually AT and above).

Well, that's uncommon. From is not intentionally destructive; maybe
the above problems are caused by something else, or there's some
incompatibility in your system.

My friendly advice is to try something else. BTW, Symantec has just

It's not the machine that supports this; it's DOS. And it's not
FORMAT, it's FDISK. And it works only with DOS 5.0 or above.

Mark Ludwig, are you listening? Your virus is in the wild and is

There are at least 13 different Timid variants, and they do different
things, so I cannot answer the above question without som additional
identification of the particular variant. Could you please specify the
infective lenght (i.e., with how many bytes do the infected files
grow)? Or run F-Prot on the infected files and tell me what it
reports?

In general - with a debugger, yes. However, it is not recommended if
you are new to the virus problem. Try first disassembling the virus
and figuring out what exactly it does.

If I examine the file, I'll be able to tell whether it is infected or
not. And if it is and you send it to the author of F-Prot, chances are
that the next version of the product will be able to handle it.

Please, read the FAQ for information about how to ask such questions.
In particular, which scanner reported a virus with this name (and
which particular version of the scanner)? There are several variants
of the Phoenix virus, but I am not aware of any scanner that calls any
of them "Phoenix 3". Could you please run F-Prot on an infected file

             Memoirs of a ("gifted") virus researcher

Note to lawyers: the following is fiction.  It must be, right?

And it came to pass, that a certain Manufacturer said unto itself,
Let me make unto myself a system controller, that many may buy it,
and I become wealthy.  And it took of its gurus, and said, now that
the controller is complete, make unto us a "sexy" application for
this new controller, that we may hype it in the marketplace.  And
the one said, Let me, for I shall use the controller to smite the
slime that infests many machines.  And the Manufacturer saw that it
was good.

And when the app was completed (or almost completed, which is as
good) then did the Manufacturer say unto the elders of AV, Look now,
upon this app which is completed (or almost completed, which is as
good), is it not fair?  And lo, it shall control the slime that ye
revile.

And lo among the elders was one (actually, a rather short one, whose
disks and CPUs were but few, but others put up with him) who spake
and said, Well, I kinda specialize in looking at apps, so I could
give it a crack, if you want.

And the manufacturer did rejoice, and did promise unto the samll
elder many things.  And after many trials did the app, in a box,
appear before the elder, wherefore he brought forth his tools and
looked into the box.  And he spake and said unto himself, This is
odd.  And he looked some more and spake and said unto himself, This
is an absolute mess!  And perchance could I make some observations,
but they would be as like as apples unto oranges unto the other
apps.  Therefore shall I clean this, that I might have a baseline to
measure against.

Therefore he strove mightily (or as mightily as a small elder can
strive) against the mess, and also (truth be told) against the app.
And after many days (or what seemed like it, anyway) the box was
again calm.  But there had arisen, during the strife, certain lost
clusters, which were now made into the form of files.  And the small
elder gazed upon them, that he might determine if they were, indeed,
needful to the app.

And one file was very large, and as the small elder gazed upon it,
he beheld its data structure, like unto a ZIP file.  And he said, I
shall extract these files.  And forth did come AIDS and Ambulance
and Anti-Pascal and BADBOYS and Beast and Burger and many others, so
that they filled the directory, and their number was like unto 875.

And the small elder pondered all these things.  And on the third day
after the small elder returned unto the Manufacturer the box and the
app saying, And if thou art so keen to combat slime, why hast thou
not yet come up with a dip switch that can be used to write protect
the hard disk, and wouldst cost but half a shekel?

But before he did, he overwrote the whole hard disk.

Subject: "Shockwave Rider" by Brunner

BKSHKWAV.RVW  930923

"Shockwave Rider", John Brunner

Two science-fiction books are generally mentioned in regard to computer viral
programs.  "When H.A.R.L.I.E. Was One" by David Gerrold is the other.
(Interestingly, both books had two editions:  in both cases the role of the
viral-type program was reduced in the later edition.  Further similarities I
cannot comment on--I have been completely unable to locate a copy of Gerrold's
work.)

A reasonably crafted and amusing diversion.  A little slow off the mark for my
taste, but the "psychodrama" cerebrations of the start give way to action by
about the one-third mark.  Good wins out over evil, the nice guys finish first
and "appropriate" technology wins the day.

Enough small talk.  What about the virus?

The "tapeworm", as it is referred to in the book, comes in very close to the
end.  It is a creation of the hero (a computer genius, naturally) used as a
tool to end the secrecy and oppression of the ruling elite.  The world of the
"Shockwave Rider" (the United States of the not very distant future) has a
universal information network.  Audio, video and data channels are all tied
together, and anyone can request information about anything from any terminal.
The elite, of course, get the information, the masses get sanitized info and
propaganda.

The tapeworm is a security-breaking program.  It is not clear, from the text,
whether the tapeworm reproduces.  There seem to be some reproductive references
to multiple "Leads":  these might be additional copies of the initiating
program.  However, unlike programs we think of as viral, the tapeworm does not
copy itself and attach to existing files.  Instead, the tapeworm adds existing
data and programming to itself.  This allows it to provide information to
requesters, and to circumvent the security and privacy measures of the ruling
class.  (The tapeworm is also incredibly intelligent.  It is able to assess and
correlate completely dissimilar data points and present them appropriately to
the user.  Hypermedia to the max.)

References to the tapeworm indicate a size that would preclude reproduction.
The authorities are not unable to kill it because of defence mechanisms or
numbers of copies.  Rather, the authorities are prevented from even attempting
to kill the tapeworm as the tapeworm has assumed into itself the network
programming.  To kill the tapeworm is, therefore, to kill the net.

Reasonably good read.  Zero information about "real world" viral programs.
Interesting conjectures.
