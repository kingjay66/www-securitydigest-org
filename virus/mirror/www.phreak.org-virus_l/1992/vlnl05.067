That's a pretty good question.  I wondered the same thing, but no one
at HAC had either the answer or even the virus.  By the way, another
person who was born on March 6th is Pink Floyd lead guitar David
Gilmour.  Coincidence or coincidence?  You figure it out:)

Hi Y'all,
        Just wondering if anyone has anymore info. on the DIR virus,
FPROT says it originates in Bulgaria and doesn't seem to contain any
destructive code, even though i can't read anything when i go into a
certain directory on my floppy.  It just churns out a load of garbage.
Deleting all the files in the directory and removing the directory
also was no good and ended up infecting the root directory on the
floppy.  I then did a CHKDSK /F on the floppy and it told me all of my
files had an allocation error, weird, Hmmm.

Subject: New variant of Friday 13th ? (PC)

Sorry this is second hand but a colleague has someone who lost files
on his PC last Friday.  He said he had scanned it on Thursday (12th)
with FPROT (2.02) and "my own antivirus program" (not sure what this
is), and nothing was reported.  On Friday he got "disk error" when he
booted the machine.  After booting from a boot backup disk:

 " got into my PC but discovered I had lost thirteen files
  including Windows, PCTOOLS, etc.
  These files now had thirteen 'candles'..."

 The missing files each showed up as:

   ^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^
   1111111111.111           03-01-60  8:13am

He eventually came to the conclusion that they could not be recovered
and he reformatted his hard drive and restored from backup.  (only
about 70% of his software was backed up on floppies - sigh).

I have scanned thru back issues of VIRUS-L but didn't find any
previous descriptions of the above symtoms.

 Does anyone out there recognize them?  Any suggestions ?

I have lumped these two questions together since both require an
understanding of how a load operates.

MBR (Master Boot Record) - absolute sector 1

In the first case, it is safe to use FDISK /MBR with any version of
DOS that supports a hard disk since all it replaces is the executable
code and does not touch the Partition table. Since the MBR must be
compatable with everything (including OS/2 and Unix in those PCs), it
is about as generic as you can get.

Note that in the case of the P-table itself, this is not necessarilly
so. As DOS matured the number of types of extended partitions increased
and while you *may* be able to boot a DOS 5.0 FDISK with DOS 3.3, it
might not recognize some partitions. In general, you are safe booting
with a higher OS but must be careful in the opposite direction

DBR (DOS Boot Record) - not sector 1 - others possible

This record also consists of data (the boot parameter block) and code
but is specific to derivatives of DOS be they from Microsoft, IBM,
or Digital Research and is specific to the operating system in that
it performs a search for one of IO.SYS or IBMIO.COM and lower versions
expected it to be in a particular place. For this reason the SYS
command and FORMAT/S will load the boot record and the two hidden files
during execution. This makes a generic replacement a touch more difficult.

Incidently, I am working on the third part of my FIX trilogy - FixDBR
- - to fill this gap - however have run into some incredible
inefficiencies along the way - looks like a Microsoft attempt to make
one-size-fits-all (IMHO badly). You may remember I was going to put
something together to retrieve extended partitions cut off by
Michelangelo & some of the techniques discovered were interesting such
as the ability to provide a redundant check on P-Table and BPB values
while adding integrity management to both 8*) The nice part is that it
seems to work with everything including DMDRIVER.BIN (more later).

Of course, the good news is that there are a limited number of DOS
cases to fix so a "smart" program can determine which to use easily
(remember the Music-Bug ? Remove the virus and the disk becomes
unreadable ? Declaired "unrecoverable" by one publication ? You might
also remeber I published on Virus-L two different ways to recover
using SYS and DEBUG (in words of one sylababble or less 8*).

In any event, the questioner is correct that a DOS 3.3 FORMAT/S or SYS
can render a large disk unuseable if DOS 5.0 was installed (depends on
whether a large partion (over 32 MB) was used. At best, the utilities
bundled with DOS will all return "wrong version" since COMMAND.COM is
also replaced.

Similarly SYSing with DOS 5.0 a DOS 3.3 (or earlier) disk will work
except that the system will now boot DOS 5.0 and the utilities will
*probably* not work either (REAL early ones, before version checking,
might).

As mentioned, the real problem is that SYS and FORMAT/S replace not
only the DBR, but also the two hidden files & COMMAND.COM. The real
answer is to replace just the DBR when necessary with something
accesptable to all Disk Operating Systems. RSN.

Subject: Re: Possible virus? (PC)

Keys locking up in caps-lock mode can be caused by TSR programs that
hook the keyboard interupt vectors. If the TSR has quite a few
instructions before the call the the original interrupt, subsequent
calls can miss interpret the SHIFT key status & lock the keyboard in
shift mode. This can also happen of the KEY shift bits are not
correctly saved between interupt calls.

I found this out the hard way when I wrote a screen blanker that was
working on systems that used a multi tasking shell. I now have fixed
the problem & all works fine.

Check your TSRs before you look further. You may have to install them
differently.

Would you not classify this as a trojan-horse rather than a virus?
Have you seen an ANSI file keypress replicate itself in other ANSI
files?

Subject: TNTVIRUS and LIBERTY II (PC)

Using VIRX we found on several computers a "Liberty II". But as we
looked exactly at the files we saw a Code from TNTvirus at each file.
So we found out that these files were protected against viruses from
TNTVIRUS after an virus "accident" some months ago. After the
disimmunition no "Liberty II" virus was found.  Is that a usual
reaction of VIRX (and F-PROT,too) or is it an anormal function of
TNTvirus?

May the discussion be opened...

Subject: Michel Angelo I am going to get you. (PC)

Hello everyone,
   I have a big problem, I found out that my computer is infected with
Michel Angelo.  When I run my norton Utilities virus detection program
it tells me that it found a trace of Michel Angelo in the partition
table of my hard drive.  My hard drive was partition into C: & D: and
I can't get into D: at all, it doesn't even recognize it.  I try to
get rid of the virus with the same program (Norton Util), but ones I
scan the disk again the virus is still in the same place.  How can I
get rid of it, and save the data in my D: drive.  By away I don't have
any backups or copies of the FAT table.  Should I use unformat to try
restoring the partition table to its original position, or maybe use
Norton Disk Doctor.  I just don't want to infect any of my utilities
programs. I appreciate any help.  Thanks guys.

Subject: Fdisk /mbr and Jonah virus? (PC)

Will FDISK /MBR fix any boot sector infector?  (I guess I don't really
mean _any_ just more common known ones.)

I guess people are still trying to get answers from IBM or Microsoft
about what exactly FDISK /MBR does... but could someone elaborate on
the dangers of using it to remove boot sector viruses.

Is FDISK /MBR a reasonable way to remove viruses like Stoned?  We have
been getting lots of calls on our hotline about Stoned infections.  I
would rather not trust a disinfecting program.  I am wondering if
FDISK /MBR is a viable way of dealing reasonably safely with boot
sector viruses like Stoned and Michelangelo?  (As long as we hand-hold
the ones that need it and make sure they don't try to repartition
their disks.)

We've got a machine here infected with a virus that VIRx identified as
Jonah (sp?).  I couldn't find anything about it in the Brunnstein list
of viruses or in the list distributed with McAfee's stuff or in the
list that came with the Norton Michelangelo version.  Could someone
suggest a good source of information about specific viruses or know
anything about this one in particular?  VIRx said it was a boot sector
infector.  So now you see why I was wondering if FDISK /MBR can be
used generically to remove viruses known to infect the boot sector.

This question is about the safety of Bulletin Boards checking for

the Ziplab program that does this on many PC-Board BBSes.  My question
is: Is it safe to check for viruses this way?  Wouldn't it be
possible, if a virus is found, that it could infect your BBS software,
because it is in memory?  And does anyone have a perfect way for
checking for viruses in BBS uploads.  I currently take my BBS offline,
shut down all the programs I have running then scan with a write

I helped one student here at Indiana State University rid her disk of
the Joshi ...I believe that's the spelling, virus.  I had personally
never heard of this virus, which affected the boot sector of her disk.
VSHIELD caught it quite effectively, however the program froze the
computer up as well.  Scan detected it and Clean eradicated it.
However, I have heard already of seven other cases just today.  Might
I ask, how is this virus passed, and what exactly does it do?

It is with their marketting claims that I have a bone to pick.  They
cause people to depend upon UT for disinfection.  This is very unfair
to the consumer and no doubt leads to lost data when UT finds it can
not safely disinfect the files.  I don't fault the product in this
area (as far as I know it's disinfection capabilities are as good as
any other) but simply the claims made for it.  How can you trust the
integrity of a product when it is sold in this manner?

This corresponds to what I understand about UT.  It can only handle
simple viruses which attach at the begining or end of each file.

Subject: FLIP virus... (PC)

Hi fellow netlanders,

I have a PS/2 model 70 which has what is called a FLIP virus. F-PROT
antivirus program detects it but it cannot remove it. I also tried
scan and norton antivirus. Does any of you have a program that will
remove that virus?

Thanks very much in advance.

Subject: New Amiga linkvirus? (Amiga)

A friend of mine unfortunately got his harddisk trashed by a new virus.
We tried checking with VirusTracker 2.37, but that one found nothing.
Vscan reported 'Memory glean' instead of 'Memory clean'. We know it's
a virus, because an older backup doesn't have it. Other programs
from the s/startup-sequence also 'hang'. Is there someone on the internet
who's a member of the anti-virus programmers team by Erik Loevendahl
Soerensen who would be interested in finding out what thing it is?
Or maybe I should use a newer viruschecker first ?
It's really not nice to have a virus and no viruskiller :(
Thanks,

  Oh,no!
  But answer is simple: virus writing started with wide PC using and
anti-virus writing started when people recognized couple of viruses on
their PC's.
  So, do you really think that Bulgaria and not US was the first
country in the world using PC's widely?
  The fact is that before starting of Bulgarian virus storm there were
more than 100 viruses written all over the world and 90% of them were
written by US hackers. Bulgaria added not more than 20 new viruses for
them. Just now antiviral researches report about more than 1000
different known viruses - from US, Europe, Japan, former Soviet Union.
Wait some years and we can get reports about viruses from Africa.
  The same reasons are valid for anti-viral activity. American programmers
at first wrote some anti-viral products, all other - later.

Subject: Viruses in Depth course

Hi all,

I will shortly be co-giving a course entitled "Viruses In depth" here
at the Institute Of Systems Science, National University Of Singapore.
Our target audience are mainly Systems Engineers/Adiministrators and
others. That aside,we plan to build expertise and a databank here.
Hopefully we can transfer tech. to Singapore's large and expanding IT
community to help fight the menace.

Some points/queries/requests.

1> Are there ftp sites where I can get scanners, monitors etc.? I am
  interested in source code for anti-virus programs , especially monitor
  programs.

2> Has anyone come across hardware protection schemes ? Last year
  a small Indian company demonstrated at the  IT91 trade fair held here, an
  anti-virus card that takes  over the PC bus before the bootstrap and
  thereafter monitors unauthorised memory access and other potential virus
  activities.  I haven't got their address but does anyone know of similar
  devices ?

3> How and where can I get a copy of the most recent version of
  Patricia Hoffman's virus information listing ?

4> I need some information on network issues of viruses. Is it possible,
  for example,to bypass the read-only server options offered by 3COM,
  Novell etc ?(personally I think so).

Much obliged,

Suresh.

Several new files have been placed on risc.ua.edu for anonymous ftp in
the directory pub/ibm-antivirus:


            tbresc18.zip (replaces tbresc17.zip)
            tbscan33.zip (replaces tbresc32.zip)
             aavirus.zip (new file, snarfed from Simtel20)


A description of aavirus.zip is below.  Also, if a updated version of a file
appears on INFO-IBMPC or Virus-L, it will usually be on risc that same day...
even if I forget to announce it.  :-)

AAVIRUS.ZIP     Check/save/restore disk boot record/MBR

I've made a (yet another) "anti virus" program, called AAVIRUS ("ACCU Anti
Virus").  This simple utility checks the integrity of the DOS bootstrap
system on a bootable disk against a checksum file created by the program
at installation.  The checksum file also holds a copy of the boot sector
of the disk, and - if it is a hard disk - a copy of the master boot record,
containing the partition table.

Follows the nice part of the story: AAVIRUS is able to restore these boot
records even if the file is lost (but not overwritten) and even if DOS
can't access the hard disk anymore.  The "emergency" option uses the BIOS
level to scan the entire hard disk for the most recent copy of the
AAVIRUS data file, using a timestamp and checksum.

I carefully tested the program on different systems and DOS versions, and,
being a quite experienced systems programmer, I don't expect you run
into trouble using this program, if you have a common pc and DOS version.
But you never know.  So:

(1) read the documentation included with the program,
(2) you use this program at your own risk. Nor I nor my employer accept any
        liability for damage caused by or following the use of this program.

I hope you'll enjoy it.
