Subject: Anti-virus Product Info (PC)

This may be FAQ, but is there any good references as to which
anti-virus (SCANv85,VIRex, Central Point, etc) are the best for the
money or more effective than others?  After just reading postings for
this group for a few days I am disturbed how often I see the a certain
virus was not detected by Product X. Does anyone have any personal
opinions on this to give some help and understanding to a novice?
  Thanks!

I don't know how exactly have you managed to "find" this "file". On
the previous DOS versions it usually appeared when you execute
Norton's FileFind and look for aux*.*. Unfortunately, I'm using MS-DOS
5.0 right now, so I can't confirm this.

BTW, regardless what you do, use the same method to look for the
"files" CON, COM1, COM2, LPT1, etc... You'll "find" them in all
directories as well. Don't worry, these are just reserved names for
the DOS device drivers. In many ways they behave as files. If you have
any other installed device drivers, you'll be able to "find" them as
well.

Just ignore them and don't touch them; everything will be OK. BTW, the
"length" has nothing to do with the real size of the driver in memory.
Ignore this information as well.

Hope the above helps.

	One possible explanation for missing 1 kB area is that
	you have e.g. SCSI disk controller that needs some 
	RAM work space. The memory area is stolen from 
	BIOS by setting smaller number into location of 
	memory that tells the size of the memory during the
	boot time of the PC. However, if you boot from the 
	floppy and the size is different, then that is not the
	case.

	Another explanation is that some BIOS'es take some 
	memory for example for IDE/ST-506 disk type information.
	My AMI BIOS is an example for this. This memory is
	used for storing user defineable disk types (i.e.
	if the BIOS doesn't know the disk type, you can tell
	the number of head, sectors and tracks manually). 
	But also in this case, it should not depend from where 
	you boot.

	Have you tried to boot the PC from HD with no CONFIG.SYS and
	AUTOEXEC.BAT files. Maybe you have some strange 
	drivers? Is the operating system version in floppy and HD
	the same?

Well, if there is someone keeping track, at the University of Florida
approx.  half of 30 computers tested (SCANV85) had the Michelangelo
Virus.  They seemed to be successfully cleaned by CLEANV85.

HOWEVER, I found the Michealangelo Virus on two of the four 5 1/4"
disks in my posession.  The other two had a stoned related virus.
None of my fifteen frequently used, unwrite-protected 3 1/2" disks had
any viruses.

One of the two 5 1/4" disks gave strange "cleaning results".  First, I
cleaned for the [Mich] virus.  CLEANV85 replied "virus removed".
Second, I re-scaned the disk.  SCANV85 replied "found stoned [Stoned]
related virus"

Third, I cleaned it for the [Stoned] virus.  CLEANV85 replied "virus
removed" Fourth, I re-scanned the disk.  SCANV85 replied "found
Michealangelo virus" Finally, I cleaned it for the [Mich] virus again,
but CLEANV85 replied something like "virus could not be removed".

Has anyone else had similar results?

It would be interesting to have a list of places infected by the
Michealangelo virus.  Since I don't normally read this group, I don't
know if one is usually posted.  Anyway, if anyone reading this message
has been infected by the Michealangelo virus, email me and tell me
about it.  (I have no solutions on how to kill it (besides SCAN), but
I would be interested in finding out how wide spread this virus
is--especially since it was on the 6 o'clock news last night)

(The virus testing softward CLEANV85 and SCANV85 used are both
licenced by the University of Florida.)

Subject: Maltese Amoeba / fao McAffe Associates (PC)

Hi all.

No peace for the wicked! Two days after finding the Green Caterpillar
virus, around, a more nastier virus has been found. This virus is the
Maltese Amoeba, (according to Bate's Viscan), or the Irish virus
(according to Viruscan). When I ran an infected file whilst running
"FluShot", the computer just hung. I don't think any infection took
place.  Curiously enough, scan ALSO reported that the Brain/Asher
virus was active in memory. This message only appeared once, and I
assume it was a false alarm.

Has any one got any more information about this virus?

(Concerning McAffe).  I recently was "testing" the Jerusalem virus,
and I noticed that Scan failed to detect it under certain
circumstances. (I won't elaborate here, to avoid giving the 'worms'
ideas). Version 85 was used.  If McAffe associates would post their
e-mail address, I'll send some private mail.

Many thanks,

Chris

Subject: Ohio Virus? (PC)

This is my 1st posting... excuse me for any foul-ups!

Last weekend, I encountered a strange situation using McAfee's Scan84.
When scanning a disk, it said : [Stoned] related virus found.  And on
the next line, it said: 3 viruses found.  Well, I cleaned off the
[Stoned] with Clean84, then re-scanned the disk.  It then said: [Ohio]
virus found in boot sector.  When I tried to use Clean84 to clean it
off, it said: [Ohio] virus cannot be safely removed.  So I formatted
the disk.  The funny thing was I later checked Virlist84, and could
not find any mention of the [Ohio] virus.  3 questions:
  1. is there an Ohio virus or not?  Was it accidentally left out in Virlist84?
  2. what is the 3rd virus on the diskette?  (it said 3 viruses initially)
  3. can boot sector viruses be safely removed with clean84?
Thank you!

Pentagon?! You said Pentagon? Not possible, must be a false positive.
This virus does not exist in live form - nobody has succeeded to make
it replicate. It -must- be a false positive.

> Pentagon virus was NOT FOUND by SCANv84, but it was found with SCANv69.

This explains the problem. Scan version 69 is a pretty old thing and
certainly contains bugs. FYI, the latest official version I know about
is 85, but I have heard about something, called Scan version 86-beta
to float around. Could we get a comment on this from McAfee
Associates?

Naw, doesn't put itself in the FAT. It infects COM & EXE files and the
boot sector.

Hmm, to my knowledge, most of the variants of this virus play a
melody. If you press Ctrl-Alt-Del while the melody is being played,
some of the variants will overwrite the beginning of the hard disk.
But then the damage will be much more serious, not just slight FAT
corruption or bad sectors...

> Also, it doesn't possible to copy it.

To copy -what-? The virus? If it cannot copy itself, it won't spread
and therefore is no virus. Or do you mean the bad sector? Then it
probably means that the sector is indeed bad, and this has nothing to
do with the virus... BTW, how did you identify the virus? What program
reported the name Plastique? McAfee's SCAN?

At least the following programs are able to remove the virus: Fprot
2.02, Dr. Solomon's Anti-Virus ToolKit, McAfee's CLEAN 85.

We have had an outbreak of what appears to be some sort of trojan,
that has been described to me as a program called scramble.  This
program renames the first part of every .com file on the hard drive to
a random 8 character string.

I would like some sort of confirmation that this is a trojan or just a
malicous program as opposed to a virus.  Also, is there any known way
to defend against it?

It's basically random (about one boot in eight boots) BUT it only
happens when the system is booted from an infected *floppy*.  Booting
from an infected hard disk never displays the message.  That's
probably why you didn't see it, and why people in general can have the
virus for a long time without suspecting...

Thanks to all who replied.  It seems that older versions of Gatekeeper

The strange behavior you describe is, as far as I can tell, exactly
the same as the strange Mac behavior I posted about around the
beginning of January.  Same Gatekeeper alert, in particular, under
similar circumstances.

Since the Mac I posted about has nothing particular in common with
yours (it was a Classic, for starters) it sounds like it's time to
raise the virus alarm after all.

I have seen instances where vendors have distributed software on disks
manufactured to not be writable (no notch on a 5.25", no tab in the
3.5") and STILL contain a virus that was picked up and put on the
master during development.
 
Anybody who puts ANY software on a machine without checking it for
viruses is assuming a risk.
 
Another of my favourite virus infection vehicles is the "infected
backup"...  in my work I have seen incidents of reinfection due to
failure to screen bckup disks/tapes when the virus was first
discovered.
 
I have also encountered people with virus infections who were
oblivious to it.  One user I asked "how long has your computer been
saying 'you are now stoned'"?  He replied that it had done that since
he had been there (over 2 years) and that it was "just some joke that
someone put in my startup so I never bothered to take it out".  That
cost us a lot of man hours scanning about 500 disks.
 
I guess that the key is not so much for a bunch of propeller heads
(:-) to sit around and discuss that viruses exist with each other, but
to educate the non-power user that there are dangers out there and
those dangers are real.

Well... There's no an easy answer to this. First, don't expect your
laser printer to infect your PC this way. However, there are printers,
which can be connected to a network as separate devices (not attached
to any particular computer). These printers are quite intelligent and
in fact are computers themselves. There's a very interesting
discussion about this on comp.risks, I'm just wondering why nobody has
forwarded the appropriate messages here. (Ken?) Such a networked
printer can do a lot of things, probably log as an active computer, or
impersonate one of the computers on the network, or even locate the
computer which is usually used to boot the network and instruct it to
write something on its disk.

Again, this does not hold for simple PCs, Novell LANs, or laser
printers, but it is theoretically possible and while it's certainly
not true that it has been used in the Gulf war, it poses a particular
security problem, with which we'll have to deal in the future.

Unfortunately, my knowledge on networking is not enough to provide a
more detailed information, sorry.

Right, but as Prof. Spafford has pointed out on comp.risks, they could
do much better without actually using a virus. For instance, a small
trojan horse, which causes inpredictable delays, which youd be
critical for a computer used in an air defence system. (E.g. suppose
the computer pauses for a moment to display the "printer out of paper"
message just while in the middle of tracking an attacking bomber...
<grin>) Or a small device in the printer, which just broadcasts
everything that is said by the people around...

Subject: IBM Anti-Virus Product 2.1.9 (PC)

A new level of the IBM Anti-Virus Product now exists.   It should
be available now or shortly from IBM Marketing Reps, Branch Offices,
the Electronic Software Delivery section of IBMLINK, and on Promenade
(the PS/1 support BBSy-thing).   I'll attach the contents of the
WHATIS.NEW file.   As I said a bit ago, I'm not an Official Anything,
so don't send me your money!   *8)

As before, the U.S. terms are $35 for an original license, $10
for an upgrade (for terms outside the U.S., contact your country
IBM).  Note that these prices are for an *enterprise* license, so
if you are a company with a thousand employees, it's $35 for all
thousand copies.

The last released version was 2.1.5, this is 2.1.9.   Versions
in between were internal IBM versions, and not released.

One of the large items, as usual, is a whole bunch of new
signatures.  Many are from our usual analysis of viruses, of
course, but some are from the UK magazine Virus Bulletin.  I'd
like to thank VB for their permission to use their signatures (or,
more accurately, their emphatic statement that no permission is
necessary, since they don't consider the signatures to be their
property!).  We ran all the new signatures through our usual
false-positive screening first, of course.  *8)

The following are the highlights of the changes and enhancements made
to the IBM  Anti-Virus Product, since the release of Version 2.1.5:

    - Added approximately 250 new signatures.

    - Audio alert (i.e., beep) sounded when viruses are found, even
      if output is redirected to a file.

    - Provided explanation of "*" option.

    - Increased maximum signature length to accommodate viruses with
      larger signatures (e.g., Grain of Sand virus).

    - Names of files to scan accepted on the command line, in addition
      to drive letters and directories.

    - Semicolon now allowed as a comment line delimiter in signature
      files.  Lines beginning with a ";" character ignored.
