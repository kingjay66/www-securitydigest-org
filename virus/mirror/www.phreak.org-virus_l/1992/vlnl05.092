As I promised, here is an extract of the document that mentioned the
problem:

The document is by James Brown (James_Brown@NPD.Novell.COM) and he
further suggests that for any security-related problems and especially
viruses you contact Eric Babcock at (801) 429-7895. Unfortunately, I
don't have Eric Babcock's e-mail address.

Now, maybe I misunderstand what the above quote really says, but to me
it means that some versions of the NetWare have a serious security
bug - the rights that you revoke remain in effect until you logout.

Could somebody who knows Novel NetWare well explain us whether it is
really so, and if yes, in which versions of the NetWare is this bug
really present.

Subject: F-Prot & DATAMON (PC)

  Hello,
The following message appears on several known to be clean machines.

    c:\virstop
    VIRSTOP cannot be installed.
    This may be caused by an active virus or an incompatible DOS.

Config.sys
  FILES=40
  BUFFERS=30
  DEVICE=C:\DOS\EMM.SYS
  DEVICE=C:\UTIL\FPROT\VIRSTOP.EXE
  DEVICE=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE

Autoexec.bat
  @echo off
  ...  < deleted >
  c:\pctools\pc-cache
  DATAMON /TRACKER+

Obviously virstop is indeed loaded.  If the DATAMON line is REMoved then all is
fine and we get the normal message "VIRSTOP is allready loaded." DATAMON is
PC-Tools v7.1 Data Monitor.  My Question is has Virstop been disabled?  Will it
detect a virus on this machine.  In general how can a user verify that the
anti-virus software he/she has installed is actually operating as expected?
Would it be possible for AV authors to include a test string/file (NOT A VIRUS)
just a file that contains some dummy string that the software looks for?
Then at any time the user could verify the proper operation of his software.


                                   Thank You in advance,
                                   Norm J. Harman Jr.

Have you ever tried Thunderbyte Scan? it has an option (-direct), this
options allows TBSCAN to run and scan your disk without risk (no
matter if a virus is resident in memory), because the programs
includes a debugger (I think Vesselin calls this tunneling) which is
able to find the entry point for Int 21h and Int 13h thus skipping any
TSR monitor/virus loaded in RAM.

Subject: Re: Polymorphic Viruses (PC)

I am new to this news group - please bear with me.  I am taking a
technical writing class this quarter in which writing is done in
groups.  My group has tentatively decided on the topic of identifying
polymorphic viruses.  We are all computer science majors but have
little experience with viruses.  One of our concerns is that there may
not be enough information available on the topic to write a 20 page
document.  Can anyone make any suggestions as to whether they think
this topic would be 'researchable'.  Can anyone provide sources of
information for polymorphic viruses for PC's (IBM).  ANY input would
be appreciated.  Thanks.

Yes.  Somebody from Symantec confirmed that "Vlad the
Inhaler" is an, ah, feature of Norton Desktop for Windows.

Trashed disk most likely a conflict with the new version of
SmartDrive & my SCSI drive.

No virus (Oh joy!).

Perhaps it is necessary to divide the polymorphic viruses into several
groups - depending on how great the variability is.  Assuming the
viruses are encrypted, and we only consider the difference between
different instances of the decryption routines, I see the following
possibilities:

 1) Identical code - only different constants.  This does not qualify as
    polymorphism in my opinion.

 2) Identical code, but with "garbage" instructions in between.

 3) Variable code, but the differences are small enough so that a
    single virus signature (possibly including a wildcard) is possible.
    (Ontario is an example of this),

 4) Veriable code, but it is possible to use a small set of signatures,
    (Whale falls into this category).

 5) Code too variable for signatures to be possible - such as the MtE.

This doesn't surprise me a bit. CPAV and other scanner do not mix
well. What probably is happening is that CPAV is not excrypting the
scan strings in memory, so scan SCAN thinks it sees that virus when it
scans memory. Try deinstalling CPAV.

     Yes, you can or you can't run it. So for everyday work you run it
but in few cases, when you try to restore loosed data from disk,
reformat it and so on you can't install this antiviral systems.

   By the way, my program makes ReadOnly bit stronger but not removes it.
Virus programmer can remove this defence if and only if:

           1. He has all DOS'es, for what this defence was made
              (now - MS-DOS 4.0, 4.01 and 5.0, tomorrow MS-DOS 6.0 and
               may be COMPAQ-DOS or DR-DOS)

           2. He has all my programs for these DOS'es, because even in
              DOS 4.01 and DOS 5.0 changes in MSDOS.SYS are differs greatly

    NCACHE don't, but it uses other virus-like trick, so you can load it before
my programs. But many of Norton Utilities, such as NDD, UNERASE, CALIBRATE
really do. And at least one editor ( BRIEF, if I am not mistaken ) accesses
disk directly via Int 13.

  They could restore modified parts of MSDOS.SYS and IO.SYS. Just now it's
not very hard to do it. But if somebody can support this idea (or can support
me :-) and can write
such defence for other DOSes or regularly place it at other positions of
MSDOS.SYS and IO.SYS then virus had to:

         1. Define difference between PC-DOS, MS-DOS, DR-DOS, ..., of the
            same version, because all of them answer: "I am DOS X.Y",
            but their codes differs too much

         2. Have in its (virus) codes original and not very short parts of
            IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS files for any of the above DOSes
            (to replace by them modified parts of files)

         3. Select concrete position and length of modified files

         4. And be sure that with new DOS version all this big efforts
            would be lost.

Subject: New Datalock variant found (PC)

   Hello everyone,
It was brought to our attention that a variant of Datalock virus is
found in the wild (DC/Virginia area). We received a copy of the virus,
and did a quick-and-dirty analysis. It appears that the virus is a new
strain of Datalock, or rather a hacked and a very buggy version of
Datalock.
   The only reason for our concern (and thus this posting) is that the
latest versions of common virus scanners (Scan 89b, F-prot 2.03a) fail
to identify the virus in EXE files. Our VDSFSCAN fails in a similar
way, but works when WHOLE flag is set to YES (meaning scan every byte
of the file). Original Datalock signatures are valid and can be used to
identify the virus. Being quite dumb, this variant is not a serious
threat.
   Here is an overview based on a preliminary analysis. The following
information may be inaccurate, so you are warned. Also, we would like
to mention that the analysis was done using Dis86 (an interactive
debugger written by James R. Van Zandt (603-888-2272), and the program
is available on Simtel and its mirrors):
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
* Location/Date: DC/Virginia area, April 1992
* Related virus(es): Datalock
* Suggested name: Datalock-2
* Responds to RU-THERE calls as follows:
   ...
   mov  AH, BEh
   int  21h
   cmp  AX, 4321h
   jz   virus_is_resident
   ...
  (In English, the virus establishes a new function for Int 21h, and
   sets the contents of AX register to 4321h to indicate its presence.)
* Signature to identify the virus:

   C3 1E A1 2C 00 50 8C D8 48 8E D8 81 2E 03 00 80 00 40 8E D8

* Takes 80h paragraphs (or 2K) of memory when resident. Directly
  manipulates memory control blocks to remain resident.
* Hooks INT 21h, and during infection INT 24h
* Virus body is appended to the end of files, and file size grows by
  1043 bytes. Both EXE and COM files are infected similarly. Due to
  bugs in the viral code, infected EXE programs will not further the
  infection. Original CS:IP is left intact, and scanners checking
  around the entry point will not be able to find it.
* For COM programs, a jump is inserted at the beginning of the program
  so that the control is directed to the virus at the end of the file.
* Damage trigger: After 1 (or more) hour of memory residency. Uses DOS
  INT 21h with subfunc 2Ch, and checks CH (hour).
* Payload: Formats track 0 on any diskettes in drive A: and B:, and
  second physical hard disk (81h).
* Infection trigger: Load/exec (4b00), open existing gile (3d), and
  find first (11h). Checks for READ-ONLY attribute, and changes it to
  ARCHIVE if necessary. File date/time stamp as well as the original
  attribute is preserved after infection. Files less than 9316 bytes
  are not infected. There are many instances of hooking INT 24h and
  restoring it, suggesting sloppy coding. Infects COMMAND.COM. Due to a
  bug, the virus will corrupt files besides COM and EXE, such as the
  ones with TXT extension.
* Does NOT contain the string 'Datalock version 1.0'
* Note: The virus is well-behaved enough to spread in network
  environments if Modify and Write rights are given. However, we did
  not get a chance to test this hypothesis. (The LAN admin here keeps a
  butcher's knife in the ofice; yes yes, he is a CNE and knows all
  about viruses :-)).

Exactly! As viruses become more and more "just another business expense",

And virtually no reviewers know how to test whole "products". All they seem
to be able to do is run scanners against a few kilobytes of different viruses
and chalk up numbers--the "hundreds and hundreds" numbers game again.  Odd
since only about a hundred viruses have ever been seen at more than a
couple of sites "in the wild." (IBM lists 82 viruses with more than one
incident reported, including only 21 with more than 10!) And some of the
"Hundreds" marketeers' products miss some of those 21!

The only review I have seen to date that had a full product review--including
an "unknown virus detection" catagory was the National Software Testing Lab's
Software Digest Report of November 1991. They based their analysis on the
twelve points listed in Peter Denning's "Computers Under Attack" (ACM Press
1990).

FYI, the 12 points (which NSTL actually expanded upon) are:

 1. Impact on System Performance
 2. Dependence on User Intervention
 3. Impact on Productivity
 4. False Alarm Rate
 5. User Experience and Acceptance
 6. Effectiveness Against Viruses (Including scanning numbers.)
 7. Post Mortem Analysis (Audit trail, etc)
 8. Impact on System Resources
 9. Compatibility
10. Training/Usability
11. Supplier/Developer Background
12. Additional Features (NSTL looked at 60)

"May the twelve points of Peter rest on your future analytical meditations."

Subject: Biohazard symbol for computer viruses?

Someone said that there is no ambiguity between biological and
computer viruses in using biohazard tape to warn of both, since
"computer floppies etc aren't likely to get biocontaminated". Aren't
they!? If a PC is used in a lab that handles bio-infected matter,
animals, etc, there is every chance that computer-associated matter
will get biocontaminated! Anyway, the biohazard destructor man wants
to be able to routinely destroy anything with a biohazard label on
without having to wonder whether it is a computer- associated item or
not, and without having to waste vehicle fuel and incinerator fuel etc
taking a Michelangelo-infected diskpack or whatever to a secure
incinerator as if it was a boxful of cholera-infected animal
dissection bits or whatever.

          I have been misquoted a lot, but that last virus-l goes a
bit too far.  I never said that because you can't get 100% of all
viruses you shouldn't try - and it was not a hypothesis.  It was (and
still is) a proven theorem.  I also said "There ain't a horse that
caint be rode, there aint a man that can't be throwed" - in other
words - there's no perfect defense, but there's no perfect attack
either.

          As to getting large percentages of viruses (or at least
large classes) I have never said you shouldn't try - but I have said
that scanners are not as cost effective as integrity techniques as a
day-to-day practice.  I backed it up with some numbers and invited
others to debate the issue.  So far - all of the other analyses have
agreed with mine.

          As for the book - yes, it describes how two secure systems
may produce an insecure network when combined - and many other things
that may have long and short term impact.  As for advertising on V-L I
have to agree - all the other companies seem to use V-L to sell their
products.  I have written to Ken about it before, but he didn't want
to publish my opinion on that subject - perhaps this one will make it.
Having said that, I won't tell you wjere to get the book unless you
contact me directly - after all - that would be advertising.  FC

[Moderator's note: As I said in my note to you, it was not your
_opinion_ that I rejected in your posting, Dr. Cohen.  Your posting
would have been accepted had it adhered to my guidelines - one of
which is that messages be _polite_.  I welcome discussion on the
product announcements which I allow here on the group; based on
feedback from readers, I have accepted the announcements because they
provide a public service.  However, if the majority of the group feels
that they should be eliminated because they are commercial, I will
reject all announcements of commercial products.]

                    Antiviral checklist - part 9

                          For each office: (cont.)

_ Memory and disk mapping utilities

In an earlier column I mentioned the need for memory and disk lists
for each computer.  These areas do not need to be checked constantly,
in most situations, so there is no need for a copy of these utilities
with each computer.  The utilities should, however, be available
quickly and easily, should anything prompt a check.  Checks should
also be done on a regular basis, and these tools can be used on each
computer in turn.

Having said that, many of the utilities needed are already a part of
the operating system.  In the MS-DOS world, CHKDSK, while it will not
show you a graphical map of the disk, will provide information on the
number of bad sectors or hidden files.  With MS-DOS 5, the MEM
program provides needed information regarding memory and interrupt
usage.  The Mac world, and the GUI OSes in general, tend to provide
less of these tools, but I believe that ResEdit is now part of the
Mac OS.

In any case, these utilities are widely available both commercially
and as shareware.  Commercial utility packages often do "double
duty": PCTOOLS probably is sold most often for its backup capability,
but can provide helpful information for other areas as well.
Shareware tools sometimes lack the interface of the commercial tools,
and more often are dedicated to a single task, but frequently have
useful features not found in their commercial counterparts.  (Neither
PCTOOLS nor Norton have the ease of access to specific sectors that
the shareware SHOWFAT has.)

I would also like, at this point, to bring up a related issue.  I
have been receiving feedback, from many sources, all tending to the
same theme: "why not just scan the computer and have done with it."
It has, perhaps, escaped the attention of these readers that at no
point in this checklist have I required the purchase of any specific
antiviral software.  This is deliberate for three reasons.  First,
this checklist is intended as a conceptual guide and is, as far as
possible, intended for the non-specialist user of any system.
Second, it is intended to show that virus protection is possible
without specialized software (although antiviral software can ease
the burden tremendously.)  Third, the most important aspect of virus
protection is that the user know the system.  That cannot happen if
the user is relying on some "magic bullet": there never will be a
magic bullet that will give 100% protection.
