Let me guess - QEMM 6.0?  I've installed over a dozen copies of this
with exactly the same results -- you see it while doing the stealth
testing.  I also scanned the disks, found nothing & shrugged it off --
no problems to date...

I'm also running MS-DOS 5.0 -- if I do a "dir aux" (or com1, com2, prn,
lpt1, etc) I see a 112 byte file no matter what directory I'm in.  Yes,
these are just the reserved names showing up, but you can see them
indeed!

Hi,

   I downloaded virx20.zip. The $toc file didn't match the zip file.
Size, time stamp, CRC are all ok, but the compressed size are
different. Apparently the zip file was repacked using a different
zipper than the one generated $toc. Can someone upload an original
copy? Thanks.

Seems to be caused by the "generic virus detection" technique. As far
as I understand, SCAN is trying to guess wither the boot sectors look
as they should... Or maybe performs a checksum on them and stores it
somewhere (maybe someone form McAfee Associates can comment on this?).
When you ran SafeMBR, it really installs itself in the MBR, so SCAN
reported the change. You probably ran it in "update checksums" mode,
so the next time it didn't detect the change. BTW, this could very
well happen had SafeMBR be a virus...

And Vesselin suggested they were an artifact of Norton 4.5 in
conjunction with DOS (MS or PC?) 3.30.

That happens to be the combination I use.  (I'll get something more up
to date when the department deems it necessary.)  I tried what he
suggested.  It didn't work with "FF C:AUX*.*", but it DID work with
"FF AUX".  It reported a file name AUX present in all directories and
all subdirectories.  Further it stated they were 112 bytes long and
the date and time stamp just so happened to be the current day/time.

Further experimentation got the same results for CON, PRN, LPT1/2/3
and COM1/2/3/4.  (COM5 and LPT4 didn't work of course.)  Then I tried
AUX again with the /A (report on all drives) parameter and noted that
the date/time stamps were STILL current (matched my watch).  Guess
that is even definitive enough for horse shoes/government work.

CHKDSK AUX reported "all specified files contiguous."  EDLIN AUX hung
the machine.

Hello Mr. Powell,

We have not been able to duplicate your problem with SCAN V86-B
hanging on your system when you type SCAN \ to scan the root directory
and boot sector of your system.

If you are running access control or other anti-viral software,
network drivers, or from a DOS shell or menu program, this could be
the reason for the problem.

Another possibillity is that you have a damaged copy of SCAN.EXE, in
which case you may want to obtain a new one.

Please note that just like Stoned, Michelangelo infects only diskettes
in drive A:.

Not all. About the first 11 Mb of it only... :-)

The number of sectors given is for hard disks. It is 1-9 for 360 Kb
diskettes and 1-14 for anything else (usually high-capacity floppies).

The "random characters" are what happens to be at address 5000:0000h.
Very often this is zeroes.

If it has Unix partitions, they will become unaccessible not just on
March 6, but as soon as the virus infects them. The same holds for
Stoned.

Why? As far as I know, it handles 1.2 Mb diskettes properly...

Yeah, and the problem will occur as soon as the disk gets infected by
both viruses.

As a result, the hard disk becomes non-bootable (although accessible).

Not "may". Will. Of course, if by "damaged" you mean a disk infected
by both Stoned and Michelangelo. If Mich has activated on March 6,
then low-level formatting is usually the only solution for most
users... Of course, you should pay attention to the technical
specifications of your hard disks, since as far as I know, some kinds
of hard disks must not be low-level formatted.

To my knowledge, no valid TSR program does this, since it is caused by
decreasing the total amount of memory from the top, while the TSRs are
normally loaded in the low memory addresses. The decrease in size can
be caused by a specific BIOS/hardware configuration though.

Also, I had one case, when a user observed the decreased memory
problem when booting from the hard disk and didn't observe it when
booting from a floppy. This sounded clearly like a virus to me and I
asked him to send me a copy of the boot sectors. However, there was no
virus in them, so I couldn't solve the problem. Unfortunately, I also
lost this person's e-mail address, so if he's reading this I would
like to tell him that I have finally found the solution.

I looked at his copy of the master boot sector not as a program (as I
did when I was looking for a virus), but as a partition table data. I
discovered then that his active partition (the one which gets control
when he boots from the hard disk) is not DOS at all, but something
called (according to Norton Utilities 6.01) 386/ix. Obviously he used
to boot from the 386/ix partition and then to chain to MS-DOS. It
seems that the 386/ix loader does some dirty things and reserves
memory just like a normal boot sector virus... :-)

Avoid making such experiments unless you know perfectly what you are
doing. This is a general message to anyone of the readers, not
particularly to you.

It does not "fail" to infect; it just never tries. In fact, it
carefully checks the accessed drive, and if it isn't drive A:, it does
not infect it. In theory this means that you can disinfect the virus
from the hard disk even if the virus is active in memory, but I do not
advise anybody to rely on that.

It had to happen sooner or later.  The "original, write-protected DOS
floppy" from which one is supposed to boot in the event of an infection
is no longer 100% guaranteed clean.  *NOW* what do you do?  You hope that
you have a machine with a B: drive the same size as your A: drive, do
FORMAT B: /S, add a write-protect tab, and use it instead of your
original.  But that only works for "Stoned" and other viri which only
infect diskettes in drive A:.  Something else is bound to sneak onto
another DOS diskette sometime.

What the [censored] is "Stoned" doing on a disk-duplicating machine
anyway?!?  Do they do their duplication on a true mass-duplication
machine or on a regular PC (which might be used for other stuff, too)?
Or do their employees pirate copies of the software with their personal
machines before duplicating it, possibly infecting the original in the
process?  How the [censored] is such a old, common virus like "Stoned"
finding its way onto production diskettes?

About a year ago, Padgett Peterson wrote to the effect, "Bring in the
lawyers!" to which I replied (not in so few words), "Not yet, they'll
take care of things themselves."  Well, perhaps it's time to agree with
Padgett.  I can understand how a company which exercises at least a
little care in checking their disks might have a fairly new virus, which
isn't detected by their virus checker, get onto their production
diskettes.  But allowing an ancient one like "Stoned" onto their disks
just jumps up and down and shouts "Negligence!"

Some federally-purchased Win computers were bought off of a government
contract, and were packaged with XENIX rather than MS-DOS 4.01, but what
fraction of the total number this is I don't know.  Those that we have
here were bought that way (thankfully).  Still, this is a *serious*
problem.

Hmmmm...  Either this report is exaggerated, the observations were made
on a machine with a high-density floppy and an unusual hard drive, or
we've got a destructive variant of "Stoned" on our hands.  Send a copy to
McAfee, Frisk, Dr. Fischer, Vesselin, or someone else qualified to make
an analysis of this bugger.

Nah, Yankee Doodle just infects files which are executed after it becomes

It will also prevent some protected-mode programs from running correctly.

Ain't no such thing as a *fun* virus.  Before Yankee Doodle was
discovered on a machine here, a lot of productivity was lost because
Lotus 1-2-3 Release 3 and Windows/386 (this was a while back) wouldn't
work with the virus in memory, and after it was discovered, many man-
hours were spent tracing its source and spread.  Perhaps if your
supervisor had to do all the diagnosis, cleanup, and follow-up work
himself, he/she would see just how much *fun* it really is.

There is a "Mirror" virus, but (to my knowledge) it doesn't leave a big
file on the drive.  Instead, it occasionally causes the display to make
a mirror image of itself.  IMHO, if there really is a big "mirrors" file
on the drive, it was most likely created by the PC-Tools "Mirror"
feature (which actually creates two files, "MIRROR.FIL" and a smaller
file "MIRORSAV.FIL"), and not by a virus at all.  If these files are NOT
present, then check for a slight (928 byte) decrease in available memory,
and for .EXE files to increase by about 927 bytes or so.  It's been around
for a while, so current versions of most A-V programs should detect it.

    I've TRIED to use FPROT v2.0 and it doesn't seem to work on my XT
computer.  All it does is give a blank blue screen and that's all.

    I've followed it's install.doc file, but it still gives me the
blue screen.  I know this might be a bit old considering that v2.02d
is out, but like I was wondering if FPROT works on XT's.

    Has anyone else have that kind of problem?

Fprot 2.02d worked yesterday (2/13) on a dual floppy Sperry 8088 XT without
a problem (no hard drive installed in the system).  Slower than mollasses
in January, b-u-t it worked.  Nailed "STONED" in a flash.  The menus looked
a little funny, light and fuzzy due to the type of screen in use (probably
the oldest color monitor still in use around here...), but it worked
flawlessly.

Fprot 2.02d also works fine on a Tandy 1000TL (80286 w/8 bit slots),
however, it can't check the boot sector on C:\ if one is using the MS-DOS
in ROM (which is fine since the ROM is READ-ONLY <grin>).

Is ANSI.SYS in the config.sys file?  Have you tried making a bootable
floppy off a known clean systems disk and then copying fprot onto that new
bootable floppy?  Also copy ANSI.sys off the know clean systems disk.
Write a short config.sys file (maybe just include files, buffers, device =
a:\ansi.sys and device = a:\f-prot\virstop.exe statements.  Then you could
boot off the floppy and see if Fprot runs on your computer properly.  Try
that and see what happens.....also play with the contrast and brightness
buttons on your computer---maybe they need some adjusting to display
Fprot's screens.

It that doesn't work, come back and we'll see what else we can think of on
here....

I've been waiting for this.  As a matter of fact, I proposed this in
answer to another question about Stoned (Which is probably still in
the queue due to being sent from a less stable machine.)

Yes, the Stoned virus will infect non-DOS formatted disks.  We have
seen that it will infect UNIX machines, even though the result will
not be infectious.  (It won't even work.)  The PCTOOLS backup disk
format is non-standard, and there is no reason to even suppose that
the disk, so infected could even be recovered.

Subject: Trojaned SCAN (87) (again) (PC) (sorry for all the parens)

I have had a report today of a trojaned (no!  I did *not* use that
noun as a verb!) version of SCAN.

The program is contained in a SCANV87.ZIP file, and was obtained from
a local BBS run by one of the larger local computer stores.  When
unzipped, the file displays the -AV codes.  The license number is not
known at this time.

When run, the program apparently deletes and "zeros out" both files
and the FAT.  PCTOOLS MIRROR was running on one machine and was unable
to recreate anything.  UNDELETE was able to recover only five small
batch files from a 120 meg disk.

The program initially appears to perform like, or rather behave like,
SCAN.  Files on the disk are listed (this is probably while they are
being wiped out.  The program then presents a screen referring to the
Illuminatus.  (This reference tickles at my memory, but I haven't
research it yet.  Yes, I know what the Illuminatus is, but I recall
some reference to it in a virus or trojan.)

I will be getting a copy for study tomorrow and will submit further
details.

Yes it does. When you boot the disk the virus will be loaded into
memory, infect the hard drive, and then tell you that your disk is not
bootable.

This was actually a pretty good book despite the translation from the
French and was probably the impetus for that army study on
radio-transmitted viruses.  In this case, the malicious software was
planted in the operating system of a supercomputer sold to the
Russians. The trigger (not a virus) was sent by a weather station in
the Virgin Islands (St. Kitts ? - do not have the book at hand)
reporting an impossible temperature. Since the computer was tied into
world-wide weather forcasts, this was a reliable means of
transmission. Made lots more sense than the "small business" RFP.

It is unfortunate that some people are so POSITIVE that it cannot be
done with a serial printer.  I have encountered "turnkey" systems
which could use the same port for a modem or printer.  If a serial
printer with "viral ROMs" were plugged into such a port, it could
easily find getty running there.  It may be IMPOSSIBLE on some
machines, but given the dismal state of awareness among the general
populace (and even our own ranks), it is definitely POSSIBLE on some
Unix machines, depending on the configuration.

Speaking for myself.
Just because it's incredibly stupid doesn't mean it isn't done 1,000 times
every day.

Subject: Latest Test Of PC Virus Packages By NCSA

The February 16th issue of Network World has another report of virus
software being tested by the National Computer Security Association (NCSA).

Here are some excerpts from the article.

	NOTE: I didn't do the test, I don't know why they did what they,
	I didn't pick the viruses, the packages, or set up the computers.
	Etc. I'm just passing this on. Bug the NCSA if you disagree with
	something. Whew. There. I said it.  (Typos are mine however.)

Nineteen packages were involved in this test:

	Central Point Software Inc.  Anti-Virus V1.1
	Certus International Corp. NOVI V1.0
	Commcrypt Inc. Detect Plus V3.08
	Computer Consulting Group Inc. Virus Clean V2.11
	Dr. Solomon's Toolkit FindVirus V3.2
	IBM VirScan V2.1.2
	International Microcomputer Software Inc. Virus Cure V2.24
	IRIS Software and Computers Ltd.  Antivirus-Plus V3.7
	Leprechaun Software International Ltd. Virus Buster Doctor V3.75.0
	McAfee Associates Pro-Scan V2.01
	McAfee Associates Scan V7a9V84
	Microcom Inc. Virex-PC V2.0
	RG Software Systems Inc. Vi-Spy V7.0
	Fridrik Skulason's F-PROT V2.0
	Sophos Ltd. Vaccine Sweep V2.30
	Symantec Corp. Norton Anti-Virus V1.5
	Harry Thijssen's HTScan V1.15
	Trend Micro Devices Inc. Pccscan V3.02
	XTree Co, ViruSafe LAN V4.50

Test setup involved a single workstation hooked up to a server running Netware
3.11. The server was a Compaq Systempro with 12M of memory and an 840 MB hard
disk, dual 33 mhz 80486 processors. The workstation was a 80386 SX PC clone
(brand unspecified) with 8M of memory and a 207 MB hard disk. Scanner software
was loaded on the server and run from the workstation.

There were two broad categories tested: detection, and features (including the
user interface).  There were a maximum of 76 points possible for features and
77 points possible for detection (total 153).

The article doesn't seem to mention what viruses were used or how many. For
features, they looked at such things as performing a self check on invocation
and being capable of sending reports to a printer or a file.

They devoted several paragraphs to scanning speed. This was evaluated by
scanning a hard disk containing 4,868 files in 148 directories. There were
147 Mb of files, of which 36 Mb were executables. A package got 10 points if
it could complete the scan in two minutes or less. Certus International
completed the scan in 60 seconds (caveat: it also scored lowest in detection)
and Dr. Solomon's Toolkit finished in 84 seconds. Central Point's AntiVirus
took five hours (!) in its "thorough" scan mode, 7 minutes in its fast mode.

Now the part you're waiting for: results, ranked by total score.
