ACMBUL 1st International Conference on Computer Viruses: Call for papers

VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  (The complete set of posting guidelines is available by
FTP on cert.sei.cmu.edu or upon request.) Please sign submissions with
your real name.  Send contributions to VIRUS-L@LEHIGH.EDU.
Information on accessing anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue
archives is distributed periodically on the list.  A FAQ (Frequently
Asked Questions) document and all of the back-issues are available by
anonymous FTP on cert.org (192.88.209.5).  Administrative mail
(comments, suggestions, and so forth) should be sent to me at:
<krvw@CERT.ORG>.

Subject: POLL: Should vendor-specific support questions be disallowed?

VIRUS-L/comp.virus readers:

A long-time reader and contributor to this group recently requested
that I disallow product-specific questions on the group.  The
rationale presented was that most vendors have their own product
support mechanisms (including BBS, toll-free lines, etc.) for this
sort of issue, and that they merely add to bandwidth on this group.

While I have my own opinion on this matter, I'd like to poll the group
to see what others feel.  If you have an opinion on the matter, please
let me know.  I'll keep all responses on-line and then tally them up
in one week from today (read: send in your vote before midnight
(EST=GMT-5) on Thursday, 17 December 1992).

While on the subject of suggesting format changes to the group, please
feel free to send in your comments on changes that you'd like to see
for the coming year, Volume 6.  (Send them separately from the above
vote, however, as I want to automate the voting as much as possible
and may well miss imbedded comments; votes should contain a simple
"DISALLOW PRODUCT SUPPORT QUESTIONS" or "ALLOW PRODUCT SUPPORT
QUESTIONS".)

Thanks all,

Ken

I've checked this package and I keep getting updates for it. It
ability to detect unknown viruses is *VERY* good and also it's restore
engine is good.  I've seen it in action when the Emmie virus was
found. Untouchable detected changes in the infected files are restored
them whitout any delay. The restored files where 100% as the original
uninfected files.

Subject: F-PROT & CLEAN won't remove this one !!! (PC)

We may have found a new variety of STONED on our campus. It seems to
infect the partition table of infected DOS machines, disabling both
the COM: ports as well as doing some unusual things to the root
directory. F-Prot 2.06a identified it as a STONED virus but refused to
remove it. Ditto with the latest version of CLEAN. After mailing Frisk
and receiving a response indicating he believed it was not a virus
(basically a blow off) we disassembled the virus code. ( we have a
site license for F-PROT and believed, up until now that F-PROT
provided superior performance AND technical support over Mcaffee's
product ) . As it turned out CLEAN *will* remove this rascal but only
after telling CLEAN that it is identified as AZUSA. SCAN *does not*
identify it as AZUSA. I have requested our systems programmer who
discovered this strain to send the disassembled listing to CERT as
well as to Frisk ( gee, maybe it *was* a virus !). Details will
follow.

Subject: Is this a real virus? (PC)

We had a lab machine die in one of our computer labs yesterday.
SCAN8.7BV95 said it had a "Generic Boot Virus" (real useful stuff, that).

I am wondering if anyone can suggest what hit me?  The machine runs
VSHIELD, so I believe someone must have booted a virus from the floppy.
But I want to make sure its not something that got by VSHIELD.  We
normally get a warning from VSHIELD when someone has booted a virus
from the floppy and infected the hard drive.  This is the first time we
have ever actually had a trigger incident.  We are fairly used to dealing
with STONED and at least three versions of PING PONG, but these seems to
be something different than the others.  Damage from all our other virus
hits has been mostly due to bad code.  Stoned has garbled many floppies,
and we have seen Marijuana messages and bouncing balls, but this is the
first destructive hard drive hit we've seen.

The virus began in Sector 0, and wrote variations of ASCII 0-255 all the
way through the boot sector and the FAT table.  (Or so it seemed to me
from using Norton Utilities in Maint mode...)  Luckily, it stopped
before it actually hit the data area, and we were able to quickly restore
the machine to working condition without loss of data.  CLEAN did no
good for us, so we just SYS C:ed from a DOS floppy and we were back in
business.  It seems to have not written over both copies of the FAT,
since we were instantly able to go about our business.

When I said that companion viruses began to appear only in 1990, I
meant those which appeared in "the wild".  Correct me if I'm wrong,
but I don't think that was true of TP_Worm (at least in 1989 and
probably regardless of date).

Oops, my mistake, Vesselin.  CHKDSK recovers lost clusters, not bad
ones.  To recover a cluster marked as bad, you'll need to use a sector
editor such as Norton, Mace, PC Tools, etc.

In a reply to Shlomo Brill about Filler, I said:

>It is not supposed to be in the wild.

I have just been informed that it has been detected at an institution
in NYC and (of lesser confidence) in Canada.

It is a stealthy boot sector infector.  On an infected machine, you
will not be able to detect the infected sectors on disk.  But from a
clean boot, you should have no trouble.

Since all the reports here have been about finding the virus in memory
and not when from a clean boot, it's still likely to be the false-id
conflict we've been talking about.

Subject: Fred Cohen's/ASP's Integrity Toolkit (PC)

I think it was '87 or '88 when Dr.  Harold Highland and Elsevier,
publisher of Computers & Security (of which he was editor-in-chief),
decided to create his Computer Virus Handbook.  Dr.  Highland and I
were the 2 "lab" test sites cited in the book, and the products
(which, by the way, far outnumbered the viruses) were also field
tested by sets of capable people throughout the world.

One of the products then tested was that of Dr.  Cohen.  The consensus
opinion, as I recall, was that it was an outstandingly capable
product, both in concept and implementation.  The human interface,
though, was [quite] a bit less than ideal, and the documentation was
thought to be a bit much for he average user.

I have been in close contact with this product as it has evolved over
the years.  It has gotten even better from technical perspectives, and
both the human interface and documentation have improved (although
neither is yet likely to be voted Most Beloved by, say, a secretarial
pool).  He has, for example, added default settings which are fine for
individual users, to the point that the documentation needn't even be
read in many (if not most) cases.

(For the record, IT is a security product, rather than an anti-virus
specific product; this makes it stronger, though, not weaker as a
virus defense.)

I do not mean to imply that Dr.  Cohen's product is best, most cost
effective or other marketing superlative.  It is certainly worth
looking into, though, if you're serious about virus protection over
the long haul.  You'll be impressed by both its capabilities and its
performance.

                                                               Jon

PS:  Don't prejudge the product by the ratty sweater he always wears.

McAfee Associates does not make any kind of memory-resident "filter"
type program to look for Trojan horse programs because it is (1)
extremely simple to write a Trojan horse, as your batch file example
shows; and (2) prone to false alarms on legitimate actions, such as
formatting a disk or running DEBUG.  Given these two conditions, it
makes it very difficult to write some sort of program that will
accurately detect malicious activity while not giving any false
alarms.

The report of the Filler virus being reported in memory is a well-known
and documented incompatibility with another anti-viral program which,
by coincidence, happens to use the same piece of code to detect the virus
but does not cipher (hide or otherwise encrypt) its virus search strings
while in memory. 

Considering that the other anti-viral program appeared several years
after VIRUSCAN was released, I think it is fair to say that SCAN does
not contain a "shoddy scan string," rather, (1) the other program was 
not adequately tested against existing anti-viral programs for 
compatibility problems before release; (2) the other program does not
cipher its virus search strings, opening the possibility of false alarms
with other anti-viral programs which use the same search strings, and
(3) this problem is not adequately documented in the other programs'
documentation.

In one of my chats with the other programs' technical support staff, I
was told that the problem should be fixed in the new version of their 
software.  Hopefully, this problem will disappear as users upgrade to 
the current version of the program.

- -----

Moving right along, this does bring up an interesting issue:

When a new anti-viral program is brought to market, who should be
responsible for compatibility-testing it to ensure that no false
alarms exist with existing programs?  And to what extent should
testing be done?  And who should be responsible for fixing any
incompatibilities?  Comments, anyone? <G>

[Moderator's note: WARNING - INCOMING OPINION...  :-) I believe that
trusted, independent testing, along with vendor product announcements,
would be extremely beneficial to all.  The testing, of course, must be
entirely objective and the (ever-changing) test criteria should be
made public.  The problem then becomes one of finding an unbiased
benevolent organization to do the work.  BTW, Vesselin's recent MTE
tests, in my opinion, performed this valuable service for the specific
instance of MTE-based viruses.]

Hello there

I have been having strange problems with my PC/Windows. The background
picture keeps changing from what I have set it to be every time I
start Windows again. Also, when I copied directory and subdirs with
files from C: to D: with File Manager, quitted WIndows and restarted
using Ctrl-alt-del, all the files I copied to D: were gone. The
directories were there though...

Also when I was compiling a windows application with Borland C++, and the
compile did not succeed, I found a file rek.obr in the directory where
the Borland project file is (the name of the exe file to be compiled was
rek.exe). The rek.obr had some mess in it, but also text "Object bro!"
and the character table of PC, first in lower case letters and then
uppercase letters.

There is some other strange behaviour, but I will not describe them here.
Can some one help me with this?

Now what's the frown supposed to mean?  Since when did a little
innovation hurt anyone?

OS/2 implements file locking: if a scan program tries to scan a file
that is currently in use and can't handle the resulting error, it may
choose to die.  (I find that anti-virus utility authors are overly
dramatic by nature, and love to have their programs crash and burn
with scary-sounding warnings whenever they encounter a strange error.
You know... if it can't find its overlay it'll say "Program Integrity
Breached!  Reformat your hard disk immediately!")  Anyway, the file
locking is the likely culprit.

There is a McAfee SCAN (V97) OS/2 beta available from
"ftp-os2.nmsu.edu:/pub/os2/2.0/diskutils/os_scb97.zip".  You'll
probably need "UNZIP 5.0" to unzip it (i.e. the current version of
PKUNZIP won't work).  You might want to try that out.

To reach an audience with a maximum density of OS/2 users, leave this
question on the "comp.os.os2.misc" or "comp.os.os2.apps" Usenet
groups.  BUT, leave out the ":-(".

You can get it from ftp.cs.purdue.edu, in /pub/spaf/COAST/Tripwire.

Not a problem!  (Plug time :-)) As it happens, there's also a Unix
clone called Linux available, free, with full source, that runs on
3/486 based PC compatibles.  finger torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi for
info.  Anyhow, I just got Tripwire to compile under Linux this
evening, without much effort.  And since Linux is able to mount Dos
file systems, I can also use Tripwire to keep tabs on my Dos
partition.  In the background.  Without having to boot from a floppy.
I couldn't ask for a better deal.

Hmmm.  I may take a stab at it.  That would definitely take a bit more
work (and time), though.

   As far as I know, Prof. Eugene Spafford and a few others from Purdue
   University are working on a platform-independent user-programmable
   scanner. It will be released in source, free of charge. Initially it
   will have routines to access Unix file systems, but since it will be
   written in C++, nothing will prevent other people from writing the
   appropriate interface to DOS, MacOS, AmigaDOS, or whatever. As you see
   - - no deep secrets.

This is one of the projects under my COAST lab.  It is being done
primarily by Sandeep Kumar, one of my grad students, with assistance
from me.  A paper on the scanner was presented at the most recent
Computer Security Applications Conference and contains details on its
inner workings.

Our work on the scanner is unfunded right now, so it is not high
priority.   We hope to have a beta test version for limited
distribution sometime in late January.  If a sponsor comes forward
for COAST with this as a priority, the program will be provided to
them first, with a general release sometime later in the year.
Otherwise, we expect a general release of the base program to be in
March.

In general, scanner code is not provided with commerical programs
because it represents a competitive advantage for the vendor.  Knowing
how to scan quickly, without generating false positives, is not a
trivial task.  Furthermore, having good patterns is also a competitive
advantage, and not something many vendors wish to give away.

Our scanner is general, and can be used to scan for any arbitrary set
of patterns in any file.  It uses generally-available, published
algoriths (e.g., Aho-Corasick) without any special shortcuts.  It also
is based on a text pattern file, with or without regular expressions.
For our experiments, we are using the published patterns from the
Virus Bulletin.  Thus, our scanner is not likely to be significant
competition for established virus detection programs (and ours doesn't
do disinfection, either).  However, it should serve as a basis for
anyone wishing to build their own in-house, special-purpose scanner.


   > Does the same thinking generally apply to
   > integrity checkers? 

   Yes. :-) An integrity checker has been already released (free, with
   full source). Prof. Spafford is involved in its creation too. It is
   called Tripwire and is available from cert.org, I think (Ken?). It is
   oriented towards the Unix platform, but, hey, you get the full source,
   feel free to port it to whatever you want. It includes several
   checksum methods, including CRC-32 (with a fixed generator, sigh... I
   hope they'll improve this in the next version), Snerfu, MD4, MD5,
   MD2... You can even plug your own checksumming method...

Tripwire was written by Gene Kim, under my direction.  Again, it is a
product of the COAST project.  It is available for anonymous ftp from
ftp.cs.purdue.edu in the pub/spaf/COAST/Tripwire directory.

The program was written to allow plug-in of other checksum/signature
routines, so other CRC routines can be added without undue difficulty;
we didn't put in a capability for a variable generator on purpose,
because we don't expect the majority of people using Tripwire to
understand how to build CRC generation functions properly.  Actually,
we deprecate CRC use in favor of other checksum methods -- they are
stronger and not significantly slower on reasonable machines.

That's why Tripwire uses published algorithms like MD5 and Snefru.
They are not secret.

   I am not aware about a DOS-based off-line integrity checker, available
   in source. Maybe somebody would volunteer to port Tripwire?

If someone funds the effort, I will get some COAST students to port
Tripwire to MS-DOS, Macs, or other systems.  Otherwise, we will be
happy to see someone else do it, or I will get a student to do it as
an independent project over the summer.  Full source is available to
Tripwire, and the copyright is such that it can be modified in this
(or any other) manner provided that it is not sold or used for
commercial advantage.

distinguished keynote speakers, and the presentation of high-quality
accepted papers. A high degree of interaction and discussion among
Conference participants is expected, as a workshop-like setting is
promoted.

Because ICVC'93 is a not-for-profit activity funded primarily by
registration fees, all participants are expected to have their
organizations bear the costs of their expenses and registration.
Accommodations will be available at reduced rates for conference
participants.
