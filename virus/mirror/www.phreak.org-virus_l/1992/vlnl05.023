Subject: Re: Ohio Virus? (PC)

Ohio virus is real there are 5 or 6 variations on it at least. It is a
realtive of Denzuk - seems to be an older version of it. Typical boot
sector virus - relatively harmless as such things go. Read about den
zuk in Virlist84 it probably mentions it..

 f-prot from skulason will remove it. mdisk will remove it
 (does clean remove and boot sector viruses? i thought mcaffee left that
to mdisk).

i had a lot of damages with a ps1. sometimes the hard drive stops
suddenly. i t ried to find viruses by unvirus 14 and no viruses was
detected. But i find an o ther hard drive (perhaps reserved for the
ps1 system). uv14 doesn't want to sca n it | some letters were
replaced by others on my screen |

can  somenone explain me what has happened ? thanks a lot

I don't know what the discrepancy is, but I went looking around with
Quarterdeck's Manifest, and QEMM because I found the same thing.  In
my system, the addresses 9FFE and 9FFF are taken up by something.
QEMM reports they are unused, but the whole 1K block cannot be mapped
because something wants them.  This has always been this way and I am
certain there are no viruses on my machine.

I think it's a case of "it's always been that way and people just noticed now"

Is anyone having trouble running Fprot's 2.02 virstop? I am running
the program after the shells from a novell 3.11 net. I have ipx v3.02
and the shell is 3.22 revA. on a machine with dos 3.3 i always get a
boot sector infection error when virstop trys to load. however when a
move to a machine with dos 5 it loads without any problems. i have
scanned the machine with 3.3 and no infection shows. thanks in advance
for any help!

We have been seeing Michaelangelo here in the woods of Maine.  The
McAfee utilities seem to take care of it, but we have noticed unusual
behavior not yet reported (apparently) with this virus. Cross-linked
files and random execution of batch files on bootup have been
reported. Unfortunately, we did not keep a copy of the virus for
examination, but we would be interested in knowing if this activity is
known to be caused by Michaelangelo or if we have another problem.

Mark, it is in VSUM.  If you look in the cross reference under '#' you
will see that it is cross referenced to the Copyright virus.  1193 is
its scan id.

This also brings me to reply to:

cbdz05mx@grtheun1.earn (Dimitris Milosis - Tasos Magoytas):

What your friend may be referring to is the DIR-II virus - its scan id is
D2.

I hope this clears up some mis-understandings.

Subject: Details on Haifa virus (PC)

HAIFA VIRUS REPORT:  (Copyright 1992, by Stiller Research)

A while ago, we analyzed the Haifa virus in order to bring Integrity
Master up to date.  Since existing information on this virus is fairly
sparse and/or inaccurate, this should supplement VSUM and other sources.

Haifa uses the variable encryption technique common in Casper and the
V2Px series.  It is a resident infector of .COM and .EXE files.  It will
not infect overlay or .BIN or .SYS files.  Haifa appears to add between
2350 and 2400 bytes to each file.  I could not get Haifa to spread on a
386 machine or when invoked on a floppy drive on any of 7 PCs.  It's
first action is to locate the command interpreter (eg. COMMAND.COM) via
the COMPSPEC= environment variable.  Contrary to some reports, Haifa
does not load itself into the highest block of memory but rather at
8000:0100.  This address apears to fixed.  DOS is not informed of
this, so no change to available memory will be visible.  If a large
program is loaded, the PC will hang because the virus code is overlaid.
After infecting the command interpreter, Haifa will infect files in the
current directory and files in directories on the DOS path.  On Aug 24th
or Apr 8th, the virus will display several lines of text begining with:

  HAIFA VIRUS V1.12
  WRITEN BY ........

The PC will then hang.  The virus will overwrite the first 76 bytes of any
.ASM file with code to overwrite track zero of the first hard drive.  Any
.PAS files with have the first 23 bytes overwritten by:

CONST VIRUS= "HAIFA";

.TXT or .DOC files will have the following text planted near their center:

 OOPS! Hope I didn't ruin anything!!!
 Well, nobody reads those stupied DOCS anyway!

(note the spelling of stupid; does that tell you anything about the author?
<g>)

When executed the virus seems to infect from two to four programs, but will
eventually infect all programs.

This virus has no stealth capabilities and can be picked out quickly by
using any directory listing program.  When Haifa infects a file, it will
set the minutes field of the time stamp to an even value (it clears the 0
bit) and it will set the seconds field to 38.  Unusual numbers of progarms
with seconds set to 38 are a possible indication of this virus.

Subject: SafeMBR and SCAN8.3B86 (PC)

Just thought I'd pass this along... When I ran McAfee's SCAN (8.3B86)
having SafeMBR installed on my MBR, SCAN reported a changed MBR, and
asked if I wanted to continue.  When I ran SCAN again, this message
did not come up.

Anyone have similar experiences? SCAN V85 didn't do this.

In my search and destroy mission of the Michaelangelo virus, I came across

info on this particular virus, could you send it to me.

As always; many, many thanks.

Subject: More about the '- -' virus. (PC)

   Well... err... uhm...

   The information about crashing .EXE files was a bit exagurated.. In
fact, it has hardly anything to do with truth. Anyway, I'm not the
one, who originated this. When I have checked it, all programs were
running correctly.

   The effect with blanking screen and so on, I have seen myself, and this
makes me still think, that it's a virus. However, I couldn't repeat it
afterwards. Ican imagine two reasons for it:

   1) Perhaps it is a boot virus, and the machine, I have seen it on is the
only one, that I use, which is booting from 3,5" floppies.

   2) Or it's not a virus at all, and the effect was caused by hardware.
(You know, you may expect nearly *everything* from old XT laptop, like this
machine..). But isn't it a bit to complicated to be caused by the hardware
jam?

   BTW:(I have resolved this shortcut, hooray!) could someone of you
explain me the following:
   a)IDE (it's a kind of harddisk, I suppose..)
   b)FAQ (is it something like Foolish Questions?)

Subject: different versions of F-PROT 2.02 (PC)

There are twor or three different files named F-PROT202.ZIP available
for downloading at various sites - this does not indicate hacked
versions, but just a lack of thinking...

I uploaded a new version, and forgot to change the file name...anyhow
- - the very latest version should be named 2.02B - I uploaded
FP-202B.ZIP just a few hours ago - there are no significant
differences between this version and 2.02, but a few minor changes
like a correction of the mailing address of the Finnish distributor
detection of the SBC virus, and a correction of a false alarm
(TUTOR.COM in WordPerfect 4.2 had a partial match with the Sylvia
search string).

So, don't worry, and there is no need to download this "bugfix"
version, unless you have actually encountered a problem with 2.02.

Subject: Looking for old Apple ][ virus reference (Apple ][)

	I'm in the process of writing up the story of an Apple ][
virus I wrote in late 1981 / early 1982. I'd like to reference another
early Apple ][ virus which was better known, called "Elk Cloner".

[That one would print out on every 50th boot

    "Elk Cloner:  The program with a personality

	It will get on all your disks
	  It will infiltrate your chips
	    Yes it's Cloner!

	It will stick to you like glue
	  It will modify ram too
	    Send in the Cloner!"
]

Its author (at the time his address was skrenta@blekko.commodore.com)
told me in April 1990:

>Cloner was also mentioned in Computer Recreations (Scientific American,
>March, 1985 I think), and also made it into Time (November 4, 1985).
>The most complete description of its creation appeared in The Daily
>Northwestern, a college paper.  Ask me for a copy if you're interested.

Unfortunately after that one message I never heard a thing from him again,
despite my attempts!

	SO...

	Does anyone have a copy of that "The Daily Northwestern" article
they could send me???? I'd be most grateful, and I'll ACK you in the paper.

	Thanks!

ABSTRACT                 The "Worm" programs were an experiment in the
                         development of distributed computations -- programs
                         that would span machine boundaries, and also
                         replicate themselves in idle machines. A "worm" is
                         composed of multiple "segments" each running on a
                         different machine. The underlying worm maintenance
                         mechanisms are responsible for maintaining the worm
                         -- finding free machines when needed, and
                         replicating the program for each additional
                         segment. The worm control procedures require some
                         careful design, but this mechanism makes each worm
                         a very dynamic and robust program.

I talked with Bob Bales of the National Computer Security Association (NCSA)
the other day.  The NCSA section of the virus forum is now open on
compuserve.
Type "GO NCSA" from any ! prompt for free help in identifying and removing
infections of any sort...contact Bob at 717-258-1816 for more info
about the group.
Also, for those reading the bulletin second-hand (who don't have net
access), the newest versions of SCAN/CLEAN, F-PROT, and TBSCAN are
available on the NCSA BBS at 202-364-1304 (n/8/1, 14.4k v.32/bis)

Subject: 20 questions (comp.virus style)

Greetings,

I was wondering if some of you might want to answer a survey of 20
questions?  Any reply would be greatly appreciated.  The list of
questions is from a piece of mail that was sent to a buddy of mine as
an advertisement for a virus seminar.  I figured that a reply on the
net is just as good and I save over $700.  Anyways, if it interests
you, please answer as many questions as possible and reply to my
address.

Thanks

    and maintenance time in rehabilitating the network?

3.  What are the symptoms and indications of a virus infection?

4.  How are viruses transmitted through networks?

5.  What steps should be taken in diagnosing and identifying unwanted
    viruses?

6.  How can I tell if the problem is from a virus or from a computer
    bug or software problem?

7.  What protective measures should be put in place to prevent viruses
    from infecting our network?

8.  How can I check for viruses on my existing computers and networks?

9.  What are Trojan Horses and Worms?

10. How do I distinguish between computer viruses, hardware failures and
    other "false alarms?"

11. What should I do when a virus cannot be removed with anti-virus
    tools?

12. How do viruses replicate and propagate?

13. How can I identify a virus if my scanning software does not
    recognize that particular strain?

14. Which anti-virus products (scanners, checksum progrms, TSRs, removal
    tools) are the best for my organization?

15. What's the best way to classify new viruses, and what methods
    should I use to automate virus classification?

16. How often should we upgrated our anti-virus tools to minimize
    software and labor costs and maximize our protection?

17. What policies should be put in place to avoid virus
    contamination, especially since the problem is becoming more common?

18. What are the most effective policies for systems design and
    configuration for securing the network against viruses?

19. What is the best way to remove the virus so that downtime is short
    and losses are low?

20. What practical recommendations and helpful tips regarding computer
    viruses can you offer to systems designers?
