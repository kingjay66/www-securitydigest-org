Is there a bug in Scan version 86b?  I have a copy on my PC and when I
run SCAN with the command line:

SCAN C:\DOS\*.*

Everything works fine.  However, when I attempt to SCAN the whole disk
(SCAN C:) or when I try to SCAN the root and boot sector only (SCAN
\), I get the following output:

SCAN 8.3B86 Copyright 1989-92 by McAfee Associates.  (408) 988-3832
Scanning for known viruses.
Scanning partition table of disk C:

(The 'S' at the beginning of the third line then changes to an ascii
character and then the following message is produced, '*'s replace
garbled ascii....

Sorry, ***********************SCAN 8.3B86 Copyright 1989-92 by McAfee Associate

I hope that's a bug and not a virus....SCAN v85 works fine and finds noting
wrong.

Subject: Are there any viruses that disable both floppies? (PC)

I'm wondering if I have a virus on my computer.  Both my floppies
won't format (can't write boot sector) and I can't boot from Drive a.
I can't read any floppies - I get "sector not found error".

Is this a virus or are my floppy drives just screwed up.

I checked the floppy controller cables and they're secured ok.

Yes, this is a concern.  I hear that the Empire Virus uses this technique,
and is therefore a real pain.  All of my (known) viral infestations
have been from stoned, thank goodness.

I'd appreciate a source for this software and a 2-line description of
what it does.  The beauty of my semi-effective approach is that it is
extremely fast (unlike McAffee) and therefore can be used literally
dozens of times per day (particularly important on our many public
access PC's).  The problem with many of the anti-viral measures I have
seen is that they are not all of: fast, effective, cheap, and able to
be run invisably by the most computer illiterate on public access
machines which have no consistency in use.

Don't worry, you're not the only one a little confused!  This might
make a good FAQ entry, Ken, if there isn't already one on it.  Here's
a proposed answer:

[Moderator's note: Thanks for the FAQ, Dave.  It's now in the file.]

Any diskette that has been properly formatted contains a working boot
sector.  If the diskette is not "bootable", all that boot sector does
is print a message like "Non-system disk or disk error; replace and
strike any key when ready".  But it's still a boot sector, and still
vulnerable to infection.  If you accidentally turn your machine on
with a "non-bootable" diskette in the drive, and see that message, it
means that any boot virus that may have been on that diskette *has*
run, and has had the chance to infect your hard drive, or whatever.
So when thinking about viruses, the word "bootable" (or
"non-bootable") is really misleading.  Almost all diskettes are
bootable enough to carry a boot virus.

Regarding the recent posting from the guy who found files
named AUX in all his sub-directories:

We had a tech call from a user this week who was dual-booting DOS and
OS/2 2.0.  He had a problem using VIRx to scan his OS/2 partition.
The scanner would go along fine until it hit a file named "COM1", then
it would lock up the machine.  It turns out that under OS/2 he had
created a legitimate file named COM1, for some reason, and while
running DOS this file was visible, but not properly handle-able.

So which commercial products have been infected with the virus?  I had
the virus infect my computer from a commercial astronomy program
called Distant Suns about four months ago.  Distant Suns (PC version)
had just been released and I was one of the beta testers for it.  My
virus checker immediately detected it and I removed it right away.  At
the time I didn't know it was a destructive virus.  I contacted the
company who made Distant Sun, Virtual Reality Labs, and they were very
shocked.  They contacted all the people who bought the program (around
100 I believe) and notified them of the virus.  There were able to
track down the source of the Michelangelo virus to one of their
newly-purchased 486 computers.  Apparently the computer was bought
pre-infected with the virus.

Subject: Pathology of computer viruses

Hi,

A brief note to apologise for a small number of technical inaccuracies
in my book (A Pathology of computer viruses), in particular the 4096
virus operational technique and the location of the boot sector
mentioned in the PC virus chapter (an unfortunate typo). As always
when this type of book is produced (the text was completed about
January 1991) a number of omissions, factual errors and new
developments creep in. My intention (if Springer is interested) is to
produce an extended second edition.

In this regard I would be keen to correct any errors, and to extend
the coverage of material for the second edition. In particular I would
like to address the new developments in PC virus techniques; extend
the coverage (and detail) given to theoretic analysis of virus
replication and detection; add a new extended section on virus
replication rate and spread modelling; add a section on US legislation
and finally extend the sections on UNIX viruses to include information
on developments in secure system models beyond Bell LaPadula including
typed object systems, capability based architectures, etc.

If you do come across any inaccuracies (opening flood gates now!)
please drop me a note. I would also be extremely interested in details
of any material which you think should have received coverage,
particularly if the material is historically, technically or
theoretically important.

Many thanks for your time

   I think, the definition both authors are proposing is too confined, or
   too narrow.

   Rather, the term should cover more than variable decryption routines.
   I'll state my proposed definition as a FAQ list entry, so Ken can put it
   into that list, if most people agree. Could a kind soul, who has a better
   command of English and/or better knowledge of viruses than I have,
   proof-read the following contribution, before it goes into the FAQ list?

   Recently, I have learned of another good term for this kind of viruses:
   Alan Solomon calls them Multipartite Viruses. I think this is a rather
   compelling term, as "polymorhic" is for the phenomenon I've dwelt on,
   in my FAQ contribution above.

   > For "Viruses using variable encryption with a variable decryption
   > routine" I would suggest the word "variable".  Polymorphic seems
   > inappropriate as the form is still the same:
   As to my understanding, the latter viruses vary their form and not their
   function; hence "polymorphic" seems just appropriate.

   Hence, I plead to use the following terms:

   * polymorphic : for viruses that produce varying instances by the
		   techniques described above (unrespective of them being
		   self-encrypting or not),

   * multipartite: for viruses that exploit several distinct infection
		   paths, and hence will be found attached to varying
		   pieces of code (i.e. at least two of the following:
		   program files, overlay files, program libraries,
		   source programs, device drivers, boot records, etc.)

I agree.  The term 'polymorhic' has been in use for a while now with
slightly different meanings.  It can be used to generically describe
code that changes itself.  We could then use more specialized terms if
needed to describe the different ways in which this happens like
encryption or instruction mangling.


"zmudzinski, thomas" <uunet!imo-uvax6.dca.mil!ZMUDZINSKIT> adds:

	2.  At that, I'm not happy about his use of "multipartite" [which
	really means "divided into many parts"].  I would suggest using
	either "cross-infector" or "multivectored" as the group label for
	critters that infect .EXE, .COM, etc.  [After all, we're stealing
	from pathology when we speak of "viruses", so why not "borrow" a
	little more?]  And I'd reserve "polymorphic" [meaning "having,
	assuming, or passing through many or various forms, stages, or
	the like"] just for the signature changers.


And back to Otto:

   If (when?) viruses will be able to operate on various hosts, we should
   coin a new term for them, perhaps something resembling the terms "cross-
   compiler" and "cross-assembler".

Though technically not a virus, the Internet Worm had the ability to
operate on various platforms by both using the host machine to compile
portions of itself to having special code for Vaxen and Suns.  The
terms we pick should represent the larger class of self replicating
programs.


This very interesting message I recieved adds some more food for
thought.  Enjoy, jv.

 Organization: Universite Catholique de Louvain (Belgium)

 If you want to use vocabulary in common with biology, it should have the
 same meaning.

 1.A polymorohic virus is a virus which THE OUTHER shell has changed it's
 composition. The immune system can't recognise it anymore.

 2.The word polymorphic means 'many forms'. The form means it's apprearance
 to the world.

 If you want to make a parallel to biological terms which is a not a bad
 idear, it should be accurate.

 We could (or you already) associate genetic code to program code.

 The morphology of a virus is the outher shell form, composition and
 structure. It is on this basis that the computer may recognise a virus.
 Virus (biology) are not recognised on the genetic code.

 A polymorphic virus (biology) is a virus which changes it's MORPHOLOGIC
  APPEARANCE.
 The code is left unchanged !.

 A POLYGENIC virus (biology) is a virus which changes its genetic code.
 Which than change it's morphological appearance.

 I think the word POLYGENIC is more accurate than POLYMORPHIC for the type of
 computer virus you want to use it.
 In the computer world, virus are recognised on the program code. In the
 bilology world, virus are recognised (by the immune system) on the morphology.

 The equivalence of MORPHOLOGY in the computer world virus, is not clear.call v
irus in computer science dont have shells equivalent around them.
 Most of the time, computer virus are just pieces of code that may be
 copied at different places.
 The biological equivalent of genetic code parts that may be copied are
 REPLICON. REPLICON are even simpler than virus, they just have the required
 genetic code to be copied around. This term is more accurate to what computer
  scientists call most
 of the time VIRUS.

 But, by shure, there is no specific limits between these concepts.

 I can currently not post this mail to the news. If you find this information
 relevant for the community please spread it. Sorry for mistakes, english is

 I refined the suggestion to the following:

 POLYCODE virus - A virus using variable encryption with a
      variable decryption routine to avoid detection by its
      "signature".  V2P6, Whale, Maltese, Amoeba, Russian Mutant
      and PC-Flu 2 are examples.

 POLYMORPHIC virus - Any virus that changes it's
      behaviour such as infect different types of host or change
      their mode of operation.  A virus that infects both .COM and
      .EXE programs as well as boot sectors can be considered
      polymorphic.

Subject: VIRx v2.0 Released ! (PC)

Microcom's Virex for the PC Development Team and Ross Greenberg
announce the release of the new version 2.0 of VIRx, our
detection-only anti-virus scanner.

We added in detection of new viruses, as usual, and something new.

Michelangelo Virus is scheduled to "trigger" on March 6.  It is very
widely distributed, from what we are hearing.  We suspect a large
number of people have infected machines who are unaware of this.  We
do not want to have them find out on March 6th, when the virus
overwrites an essential area of their hard disk.  So, until after
March 6, VIRx 2.0 will not only detect MICHELANGELO virus, but will
also safely remove it from the infected drive(s).

The use of VIRx is free to individuals and educational institutions,
still.  Corporate and governmental entities should note the changes
