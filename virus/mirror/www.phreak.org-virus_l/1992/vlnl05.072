OK, here's the deal.  If the last two bytes of sector 0,0,1 are
055h 0AAh, then FDISK /MBR leaves the PT area of sector 0,0,1
alone and just writes the MBR to it.

If the last two bytes of sector 0,0,1 are *not* 055h 0AAh,
then FDISK /MBR fills the PT area of sector 0,0,1 with
*nulls*.

The moral of the story seems to be this:  FDISK /MBR will clean
a boot sector virus from your PC only if the virus code in
sector 0,0,1 does not encroach into the PT area, *and* the virus
code did not modify the last 2 bytes of sector 0,0,1.  Michelangelo
meets both these requirements (at least the strain we've seen here
does), and so FDISK /MBR works.  But it is not a general-purpose
solution for every boot-sector virus.

What are the obvious reasons? I a virus does all the following...

  - saves a copy of the original sector 0,0,1 when it installs itself
  - loads and executes the original 0,0,1 when the PC is booted
    ( after executing itself, of course )
  - intercepts int13 and returns the original 0,0,1 when an app
    calls for 0,0,1

.. then I don't see why the virus has to leave the PT table area
of the MBR alone.

I believe this is correct.

> Doesn't FDISK /MBR just rewrite the MBR program? Does is try to

Yes and no.  I tried the following two experiments:

1) I filled the entire sector 0,0,1 of a Compaq 386 with the letter
'E', booted from a DOS5 diskette, and ran FDISK /MBR.  This created
a nice MBR in sector 0,0,1 but the PT area of 0,0,1 was now filled
with nulls.  So in this case, FDISK /MBR changed the PT (from all
'E's to all nulls ).

2) Using a sector editor and a saved copy of the original sector
0,0,1 I restored the PC to its original condition.  Then I garbaged
up the MBR part of 0,0,1 but left the PT area alone.  Then I ran
FDISK /MBR again as above.  This time I wound up with a bootable
disk.  FDISK /MBR left the PT area alone.  Seems like FDISK /MBR
is smart enough to leave a "good" PT alone? Go figure.

I have some questions: (at least one is not a faq)
1) Is there a possibility to get the latest version of scan via email?
   If there is one, where can I get it?
2) Now the FAQ: (I make some statements and ask for a short yes or no)
  a)Michelangelo is NOT a *.COM or *.EXE or *.SYS infector.
  b)Therefore you can't be infected from downloaded programs.
3) Is there really a FAQ-list?? If yes, when will it be sent ?

A virus can't do anything unless it gets executed.  If someone just
uploads a file to a BBS, and the BBS software just examines it, as
data, there's no way anything in that file can run, including a virus.
Of course, if somewhere in that process the uploader (or an accident)
can arrange for the data in the file to be -executed-, all bets are
off.  This means, for instance, that the scanning process must be
careful that the programs it runs come from some safe directory, and
that there's no way a name-conflict can cause the program that's being
examined to be run instead!

Only a slight misapprehension!  *8) The situation is complex, and
there are a number of ways to describe it, but I think it's clearest
like this:

  - There's a small family of boot-infecting viruses called
    variously "Campana", "Telephonica" and so on, which infect
    only boot records (no effect on files), and do nasty
    damage and display a message against some telephone
    company after a number of boots.  They are basically
    normal boot infectors, and spread just fine by
    themselves.

  - There's another group of viruses, called things like
    "Telecom", which are memory-resident file infectors
    (some infect only COM files, some both COM and EXE).
    As a side-effect, these viruses *install* the above-
    mentioned boot infector onto various disks.

So it's perfectly possible to have just the boot-infector (in fact, it
seems to be much more widespread than any of the file-infectors, most
of which are rather buggy).  On the other hand, *if* you have one of
the file-infectors, you almost certainly have one of the
boot-infectors as well (since the former install the latter).

In your case, I'd guess that you have a normal infection by one of the
boot-infectors, acquired by booting from an infected diskette, and
that your files aren't involved at all.

Subject: SBC Virus identified by F-PROT (PC)

I have run F-PROT and had the message returned identifying one file as
having an error "ERROR IN C:\GK4\GK4.EXE" and an SBC infection in
"C:\IDM\RS1.EXE".  The machine is an old XT (belongs to a friend) and
IDM is the brand name.

The GK4.EXE file was a "demo" program lent by a salesman almost a year
ago.  Recently, problems with setting the system date have surfaced on
the machine - no matter how often you reset, the date resets on
re-boot to 01-01-2000.  I thought initially it might be the backup
battery failing - but when I dropped by to check out the machine,
Norton Utilities shows the 20 mb hard disk as having 8.5 mb of files,
1.2 mb free, and ~9 mb in "unmoveable sectors/files?"

I assume this virus has been running along merrily, writing these hidden
"unmoveable sectors", and gradually filling up the hard disk.

I guess the only option is to back-up the uninfected files, reformat the
hard disk, and start over.  I've never run into a virus before (being
relatively paranoid about files from unknown sources - I always check a
disk before copying it) - so F-PROT can identify it ... now what do I do?

Has anyone else had these symptoms?

Am I solving the problem the right way?  HELP!!

Off course, the exact offset depends on how many partitions you have.
E.g. on my (compatible) PCD-2M, which has only one partition, these
Bytes are at offsets 1F6..1F9. Generally speaking, you'll have to look
at 1F6, 1E6, 1D6, and so on, and choose the smallest starting address
you can find.

Subject: Michelangelo bug ? (PC)

I have a PC XT running under MSDOS 5.0 and recently discovered that
the boot disk along with some others was infected by Michelangelo
virus.  Funny thing is that all the contaminated diskettes had been
unused for at least 2 months.  So,is Michelangelo more older than
already assumed ?

But the strange in this occasion is elsewhere : after i cleaned ALL
the other diskettes (using Viruscan 85 by McAfee) i thought i could
test the boot disk to see how the virus works.  Well, no matter how
many times i tried, Michelangelo never activated, although i used no
other program to monitor it.  This, along with what i wrote on the
first paragraph, makes me wonder if there is a serious bug in
Michelangelo's code or whether there are two versions of it ( or even
more).

Anyone out there with some idea?

 ParaScan is a joke program that simulates a virus scanner.  It acts
like it is scaning your computer for viruses and then it displays
messages like
  "Hot Damn! You got one!"
  It then "identifies" the "virus".  For example, there is the "Gerald
Ford" virus (Predecessor of the "Dan Quail" virus).
  It's a fun program.  If you are interested in it, I recommend the
book "Stupid PC Tricks" It includes a disk with 10-20 amusing programs
for the PC, including ParaScan.  It should be in your local bookstore
(B. Daltons, WaldenBooks, etc.)
  Have Fun!

I've used both F-PROT and CLEAN on a diskette infected with the stoned
virus where the "original" boot sector was missing, and appreciate the
problem the software has in finding a good boot sector to replace the
infected one with.  There are, as I understand it, legal problems with
a commercial product carrying its own copy of a MicroSoft boot sector
(although I don't understand why, since the distribution disk is
allowed to have one, surely). Anyway, for what ever reason, these
disinfecting programs insist on trying to use the original boot
sector, if they can find it on the disk. I know F-PROT 2.02 will
refuse to disinfect if it finds the replacement is not a valid boot
sector, not necessarily infected, by the way, but (in my case) all
zero bytes. While SCAN seems to not care what it contains.  I must
admit that allowing an infected boot sector to be written there is a
surprisingly bad flaw.

There seem to be two better possibilities...

(1) hunt around the current disks (all hard disk partitions anyway),
    looking for a good boot sector, and copy that, or

(2) carry with the program a good, but not copyrighted, boot sector;
    I've got one if anyone is interested, by the way.

Now there is a problem with all this: it is impossible to produce a
boot sector which will be truely bootable with all versions of DOS.
Not only does it have to cope with calling the "invisible" files -
even when they don't start at the second cluster, but the DOS seems to
makes calls back to locations inside the original boot sector for disk
I-O, and those entry points vary from version to version.  So the
answer is to make it a non-bootable diskette - which most would be
anyway, and if anyone wants it bootable they must redo the SYS
command, which is a darned good idea anyway.  Of course, the
disinfector would have to have to fix up the BPB to suit the disk.

There are some disinfectors that do this sort of thing now.  Why don't
the major ones like CLEAN and F-PROT?  Surely it is easy to implement,
and very safe.  Is there some disadvantage I'm missing?

And look for the smallest nonzero 32-bit number (least significant

(All those are starting sector numbers of partitions).  Also, those
are in 9th to 12th columns, not 8th to 11th like I said before.  They
start at offsets 1C6, 1D6, 1E6, and 1F6 in the actual MBR.

McAfee's SCAN calls this DenZuk; I don't know why F-Prot calls it
Mardi Bros (virus names are the 8th wonder of the world). What it does
is replace the boot sector with something that calls the main part of
the virus from the 41st track with high sector numbers.  (Most, but
not all, diskette drives let the heads go pas the 40th track - viz pas
track #39).  There's quite a lot in teh virus, can't remember it all
at the details at the moment.  What would you like to know about it?

Yes. All you need is to boot from a DOS 5.0 diskette and use the FDISK
program from there. It doesn't matter what DOS version resides on your
hard disk. FDISK /MBR rewrites the master boot sector program, which
is not DOS version-specific. (It is operating system specific,
however, for instance, some versions of Unix might use a different MBS
boot program.)

This is called a ghost false positive and is caused by Scan's silly
way to check the memory. It scans the whole memory for the virus
signatures, instead of looking for them only where they have to be. In
your particular case, it finds the Form signature in the DOS buffers.
It is there, because DOS has read the infected boot sector when you
tried to obtain a directory listing of the infected diskette. The
virus code is not active, though, since it never gets control.

Yes, this is a false positive. CPAV is silly enough not to encrypt its
scan strings. Throw it away.

Yes. Throw them away.

Subject: Central Point and OS/2? (OS/2)

Does anyone have experience using Central Point's Anti-Virus with OS/2
2.0 and a HPFS partition?  I am planning to upgrade to OS/2 and was
wondering how CPAV would deal with the partion and boot sector.

Thanks for any help/insight.

                    Antiviral checklist - part 6

                          For each office: (cont.)

_   List of all hardware and software purchased, supplier and serial
         number

As I mentioned before, this is one of the items that should be a part
of any office computer "kit" simply on the basis of good management.
The reason for its inclusion on the virus fighting side is partly in
an attempt to track where a virus came from.  (Again, as I have
mentioned before, originals should be protected, copied, and the
"copies" protected before installation.)  More and more companies are
becoming aware of the need for software auditing, and this may become
very helpful here.  (It is less helpful in those companies which take
a "righteously indignant" stance against shareware.)  The hardware
list is also valuable, as certain pieces of hardware will affect the
operation of the computer, particularly in regard to memory
utilization.

_ Designated machine for receiving/ testing new disks/software

Now *this* recommendation I *know* is going to stir up a storm.  It
always does.  Why spend good money on a machine that is going to be
used for nothing except testing software?

This appears to be based in the deeply rooted prejudice which says
that the only important part of a computer system is the part you can
see, feel and throw through windows at times of stress.  Let's look
at the picture in real financial terms.  If you buy two copies of a
commercial antiviral program (for an "office" of, say, twenty
computers), plus the "upgrade fees" for a year, you've spent about
$400.  $300 will get you a bare bones PC for testing, and, in
addition to antiviral testing you can also detect trojans, which
relatively few antiviral programs do.  (An AT level machine should
only be $500, even low end Macs can now be had for about $1500.)  A
designated machine also allows you "pro-active" rather than reactive
protection.

Besides, very likely you already have a computer that no one in the
office will use because of its age and "obsolescence".  However, a
word of warning is in order here: we have seen cases, most recently
with Michelangelo, where older machines will not detect the full
range of functions of the viral program.  There are also a number of
viri which are "version specific" in terms of the operating system;
but it is relatively easy to set up a situation which allows for
quick changing of the operating system.

One point I also stress in regard to testing is to make sure that the
hard disk is not empty.  There are some "prima donna" viri which
refuse to operate unless it is "worth their while" in terms of the
amount of file space used.  Keep the drive about 80 percent full.
