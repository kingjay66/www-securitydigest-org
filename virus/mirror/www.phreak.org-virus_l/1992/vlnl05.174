Subject: scan with compressed drvs?? (PC)

   I couldn't find the FAQ post, I hope this isn't covered, If it is
please forgive me.  I have questions in relation to use of NAV. with
superstor. I know when I was using stacker I had to run NAV from
within a stacked drv to insure proper scan results due to problems
with stacker I have switched to superstor and while it(in my opinion)
is a more stable and superior compression prg. the documentation
sucks. I have called them and got half an answer (perhaps this is why
stacker is #1)
  MY QUESTIONS:
 1> should I run NAV from within the superstor container also- I
assume so as the basic concepts between the two are the same.
 2>can I run NAV from within a stacked container and get proper
results on a scan of a non stacked drv.
please Email answers to confused@cwis.unomaha.edu
 THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME

I sincerely hope that no anti-virus program will be that stupid! Under
OS/2 in 32-bit mode, when your program (or a virus) wants to "address"
a memory chunk, it must first allocate it. And when it allocates it,
the OS nicely wipes it out. Therefore, there's virtually no hope to
"find" the virus in this way - the most you could do it to wipe it
out. But you cannot do even that, since memory allocated for one
process is protected from the other processes, so they cannot just
poke around...

Correction: the discussion is not based on the percentage hit rate.
There is no such thing as percentage hit rate when you are speaking
about a known virus. Your scanner either is able to detect it
reliably, or it isn't. My tests are trying to show which scanners are
NOT able to detect the known MtE-based viruses reliably (because I
cannot prove that I scanner DOES reliable detection - I can only try
to find out an example that proves that a scanner is NOT able to do
reliable detection).

Simple. :-) Reliable detection of the MtE-based viruses is -extremely-
difficult. Therefore, only anti-virus companies with very capable R&D
departments are able to solve the puzzle. (Note: this is not a flame
to anyone; for instance I don't know how reliable detection can be
achieved.) The current tests clearly show that very few AV companies
have indeed solved the puzzle.

BTW, it was demonstrated to me that no scanner can be made to detect
reliably unknown unencrypted MtE-based viruses. Sorry, but I cannot
discuss the details in public. The important thing is that the virus
could do some tricks to prevent this. None of the currently known
MtE-based viruses does this trick, so this fact should have any
impact on the current MtE detection by the scanners.

Am I sure about -what-? That SCAN 97 does not detect Commander Bomber
reliably? Yes, I am sure about it. It doesn't detect it reliably. It
misses this virus in some of the infected files.

Couldn't people get their facts right before posting? Anyway, here is
the correction:

1) Dark Avenger has indeed been involved heavily in the development
of the MtE, but according to some sources, this is not -entirely- his
product.

2) All the MtE does by itself is to take a piece of code, encrypt it
using a random key, generate a random decryptor, prepend the decryptor
to the code, and return a pointer to the area of memory that contains
the decryptor and the encrypted code. Nothing more. Not a virus per
se. Everything else has to be supplied by the virus writer. The
changes of the file sizes, checksums, and other info that you are
mentioning come from the virus, not from the MtE. It is perfectly
possible to write a stealth MtE-based virus, that will hide these
changes.

3) The latest available version of MtE is 0.90-beta. What has been
distributed as 0.91 and what many people blindly believe to be 0.91 is
just a bugfix in the random number generator (not in the MtE).

4) No self-respecting anti-virus researcher will distribute the MtE
package to anybody except other anti-virus researchers.

Changes filesizes and checksums???  You've missed the entire point of
MtE!  MtE (Mutation Engine) is a method for converting a given virus
into a *polymorphic* one, i.e. one which looks different on each
infection, because of variable encryption and/or because of replace-
ment of some instructions by others which have the same effect.
  MtE consists of an .OBJ module which, when linked to a assembled
virus containing a call to it (and to a random-number generator
supplied in another module), causes the virus to become polymorphic.
  There are several specially designed scanners which claim to achieve
perfect detection on MtE'd viruses, and these claims are often correct
in the case of mutations in which the viral code is actually encryp-
ted.  But in some cases MtE does not perform an encryption, and some
scanners fail in such cases.  A few scanners succeed in detecting all
such viruses in some existing text suites, but it is apparently
impossible to obtain 100% detection on all possible MtE mutations
(i.e. even when the underlying virus is unknown) in those cases in
which an MtE encryption is not performed.

Don't blame Borland for what it not their fault. VCL is created with

It creates buggy, usually not running, not optimized at all, stupid
overwriting .COM infectors. Some of them can overwrite just all files
(*.*), but this does not mean that they can correctly infect EXE files
(i.e., without damaging them). It can also produce lame trojan horses.
It also tries to produce companion viruses, but they don't work.

You mean, if you are good enough in assembly language, you might find
the bugs in the viruses that VCL generates and eventually fix them. I
mean, fix the viruses, because you cannot fix the VCL program itself -
it's too buggy for that. But why bother? Anybody who is able to fix
those bugs should be able to write a virus himself, instead of using
the stupid things that VCL generates... :-)

Of course, it doesn't create any serious problems. The only serious
problem is the trend - it's much harder to deal with 2,000 virus
creation tools than with 2,000 viruses... Fortunately, it is much
harder to write a working virus creation tool than it is to create a
working virus...

Hello, everybody!

The following is part of a posting to one of the newsgoups. I am
submitting here the relevant part, which I believe to be of interest
to the readers of VIRUS-L/comp.virus.

Regards,
Vesselin

Subject: MSDOS 5.0 chkdsk WARNING!
Date: 30 Oct 92 19:12:47 GMT
From: john@attcan.UUCP (John Benfield)

[stuff deleted]

(This is NOT an official report from Microsoft or AT&T. It's just
 my own friendly posting to try to help)

Program: chkdsk
O/S    : MS-DOS 5.0

Symptoms: Users running chkdsk with the /f option have 256 copies
          of the FAT written onto their hard disk starting at the
          first copy of the FAT. The result being that all directory
          information and a significant amount of the data in the data 
          area are irrecoverably destroyed.

Affected users: Any users using 256 sector FAT's. 

How to tell if you're at risk: 

          Run chkdsk WITHOUT the '/f' option and check the 
          "Total allocation units on disk". If this number is
          more than 65280, you're at risk. DO NOT USE CHKDSK TO
          CORRECT ANY DISK PROBLEMS if this is the case. You'll
          trash your disk.

Solution: Call Microsoft and request the 5.00A upgrade. They know
          about the problem and they've fixed it. They've also done
	  some diddling with the following programs: (though I don't
          know what they did to them.)

	deloldos.exe	diskcomp.com	diskcopy.com
	doshelp.exe	dosshell.exe	dosswap.exe
	emm386.exe	expand.exe	format.com
	himem.sys	mirror.com	qbasic.exe
	recover.exe	setver.exe	undelete.exe
	xcopy.exe

Apparently, the only place that Microsoft posts information of
known bugs is on CompuServe in something they called the Microsoft
Knowledgebase. If there's anyone out there who regularly reads this
forum on CIS, maybe you'ld like to volunteer to cross-post to this
group?

No. During boot, you'd simply install Virscan as your first step, and
let it trap anything that attempts to load while infected.

On booting, the memory contents are ignored and overwritten, so there's 
no need to scan it.

No, not to me. I want to see a high hit rate from a large suite of 
test files, using every MtE-based virus known to generate the test
files. I'm not concerned with the algorithm, for a few reasons:

a) I'm not writing viral or antiviral code, so I have no use for it;

b) The authors of the antiviral products have invested a considerable
amount of work in them, and I see no reason to disclose that information
to their competitors (free information is a nice idea, but won't work in
other than a utopia, which we're not in...);

c) Disclosing how the scanners detect MtE would assist Darkie in finding
ways around detection, something I'm *not* in favor of;

d) There are independent surveys of the effectiveness of the scanners,
listing how well each of them do in identical environments.

If VIRUSCAN did not pick up unencrypted copies of a virus, that means
that we do not have a copy of the virus.  Readers may wish to note
that sometimes the MtE produces an "unencrypted" virus, that is, one
where no MtE encryption is performed.  In this case, no MtE virus
would be found, and VIRUSCAN (SCAN) would have to look for the actual
virus code.  If we do not have a copy of that particular MtE-based
virus, then unencrypted copies will not be found until we receive a
copy and analyse it.

Since OS/2 is a virtualizes memory in DOS sessions, you would only
have to check the memory allocated for that particular DOS
session--not all the memory available to the system.

Hello Vesselin,

SCAN missed 317 out of 15,996 viruses, or about 0.02% of the samples.  
Rather than post the "alarming" results, do you not think a message to
myself (or better yet, to one of our programmers) would have sufficed?

A detection rate of approximately 99.8% on a virus, or set of MtE-based
viruses does not seem especially bad, in lieu of the fact that we have
not received any confirmed reports of the virus yet [outside of virus-
exchange BBS's and the like].  

[...comments about detection of MtE-based viruses added in SCAN V97 
from myself and your comments about downloading V97 deleted...]

>The results are rather poor - they clearly show that version 97 of

Yes, you have, and I am not so much questioning this as the manner in
which it was reported.

Next time, perhaps you could check with us about your results?  I think
it would be more appropriate to say "SCAN missed X out of Y samples of
the Z virus.  I've notified McAfee Associates of the problem and they
will (hopefully) fix it shortly." than your earlier post, which seemed
rather alarmist to me.

You did download V97 of SCAN as fast as you could and repeat your
tests, which I find commendable.  Even if I don't agree with how
you reported the results.

>an article posted somewhere (maybe even here), which described how

McAfee Associates has sponsored (that is, paid for) anti-virus product
testing by a number of independent organizations, using then-available
versions of competitors' anti-viral programs.  To do otherwise would be
worthless.

True, but they all of them are also widely-used, at least here in
America.  In Europe, I would imagine that Dr. Solomon's AVTK is used
more widely, etc.

Hopefully they will be published together at once.

[Moderator's note: Vesselin's MtE tests are available from:
   cert.org:pub/virus-l/docs/mtetests.zip
   ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de:pub/virus/texts/tests/mtetests.zip
For those without FTP access to the net, I have broken Vesselin's
tests down into multiple chunks and will be posting each separately.]

[...rest of message deleted...]

Bugs can be fixed.  Bearing in mind that I am, after all, a McAfee
Associates employee, I believe that McAfee Associates (and myself) have
been very forthcoming to users about reporting bugs, fixing them, and
suggesting workarounds while the bugs do get fixed.

We have just located a Goblin Virus on a researcher's disc who has
come from Mexico.  I have used the latest version of Dr.Solomon's
Toolkit to erase the virsus but just wanted to know how wide spread
Goblin is and whether the disc I repaired should still be used, in
case any residual affects remain.


I look forward to hearing your views

Subject: Outdated F-PROT?? (PC)

Frisk and all,
             I am currently using F-prot 2.04b on my machine and am
using Virstop.  I haven't had any problems until recently.  I wanted
to use F-prot 2.05 but since there was some mention on problems, i
decided to stick with 2.04b.  Anyway, now when i boot up my machine,
when it loads Virstop, it gives a message that sounds something like
"This version of F-prot is rather old and ..." overall what it is
trying to say is the version of f-prot i have is old and that i should
replace it.  Is this some form of virus, a way of your program
notifying me to switch or what?  This message comes on the screen
without fail for the past 2 weeks.  Any help would be great.  BTW,
what is the scope on the latest version of f-prot?  Thanx.

	Until I received a disk error this morning, I had a copy of a

Subject: Am I Infected? (PC)

I had the stoned virus and I was getting 1701 (or 1710, I forget)
error on bootup. Supposed to indicate a hard disk error, I think.

I replaced the hard disk and controller, virus scanned everything that
went into the new disk. Ran the machine for a couple days with no
problems, then, after leaving it powered down for two weeks, it came
up with the 1710 (or 1701, I for...) error again. Now it boots
erratically, but it will boot from a floppy, which it wouldn't do with
the old drive. (Won't access the hard drive after floppy boot.)

Am I stoned or hardware failured? Help, help, hellanddamnation.

FP-206A.ZIP     F-PROT 2.06a: Virus detection/removal software

I don't know why this always happens....but right after I uploaded
F-PROT 2.06, I got a message about a problem, which forced me to
release 2.06a

The problem is as follows - if a single copy of the program is
installed on a network, it can only be used by one user at a time -
attempting to run the program while somebody else is running it will
generate a sharing violation.

I'm really sorry about the inconvenience....
