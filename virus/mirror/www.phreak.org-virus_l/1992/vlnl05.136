This really isn't very odd, since Michelangelo is a "version" of
Stoned.  I have seen SCAN report Michelangelo as Stoned at times.
Which version of SCAN are you running?

It is, of course, possible that this is a modification of Michelangelo
or Stoned which is similar enough to the original to be "found", but
identified differently by different scanners.

Overall, though, I'd go with the Vi_Spy id.

I am a distributor of Victor Charlie in Canada.

It takes a radically different approach to virus control than McAfee's
products.  It is a generic product which looks for virus activity and
can detect all viruses even those previously unknown.

It has a range of utilities the most useful of which are:

  - a quick (3 second) routine which runs bait files and checks key
  files and areas to detect active viruses.  Once detected the signature
  of the virus is captured in real time and a reboot is forced to purge
  it from memory.  Because of this feature you do not have to depend on
  updates from the developer nor risk extensive damage to your files due
  to a virus unknown to the version of the scanner you have;

  - an audit routine that allows you to record encrypted checksums of
  all your executable files and later run a comparison.  This will
  detect all changes to files and allow you to track down elusive
  viruses;

  - a low level AI routine to learn from each new virus detected and
  develop methods for detecting viruses within that "family" of viruses.

VC is a highly secure product designed to foil viruses which may be
specifically written to attack it.

It currently does not use a TSR due to the vulnerability of TSR virus
monitors to such targeted viruses.  VC's checks are easily put into your
applications menu or batch files which allow it to be run automatically
(and silently) frequently during your computing day.

It is, one might say, a scanner in reverse.  Rather than relying on
scanning new files for viruses which the scanner knows about, VC is run
after a new application is run to see if any viruses have gone active.

VC does have a scanner which it updates itself.  One can use it for
scanning new files but it is primarily for used for tracking down a
virus once detected by the method described above.

Given the stealth viruses and polymorphic viruses which are out there,
scanners are becoming more and more limited in their effectiveness.

VC retails for $139 and requires no updating.

It is distributed in the States by Computer Security Associates at
(803)-796-1935 and in Canada by Lannatec Associates Inc, 166 Anna
Avenue, Ottawa, Ont. K1Z 7V2 tel (613)-724-5978.

Subject: F-Prot and Stoned (No-Int) Virus (PC)

We are evaluating F-Prot.  I saved a copy of the No-Int Stoned virus
on a floppy disk for later testing.  When using F-Prot on the disk, it
says it can not clean the virus because it can not locate the original
boot-sector.

The No-Int Stoned virus is about the only virus that gives us trouble
around here.  Does anyone have any experience with cleaning up Stoned
with F-Prot?

We have a program to restore the boot-sector of the hard disk from a
good copy of it, but it doesn't work to restore floppy disks.

This is for glratt@rice.edu.......

As to your problem about your c: drive being write protected,  I have
encountered this before myself.  The problem would appear to be with your
compression system Stacker.

Apparently, if you have stacker set up to swap C: and D: at boot up so that
c: is the stacked drive, and the contents of config.sys get messed up, then
you will not be able to write to your boot drive C:.  The only way that I
found to correct this was to reformat the hard drive.

Anyone else have any ideas??

I want to thank Fridrik for answering this so the discussion can be cleared

The Wonder-2 false-id situation existed for the original June update.
Upon hearing of the false-id situation, a subsequent update was released
which does not have the problem in it.  The original June update would be
20A04.DEF or 15A09.DEF (depending on whether you're using 2.0 or 1.5).
Loading any updates beyond 04 for 2.0 or 09 for 1.5 will remove this
problem from your system.  We are about to release (or have already released
by the time this posting is made) the August update set which are 20A07 and
15A12, respectively.

The Michaelangelo (actually spelled Michelangelo) is simply a hacked
version of the stoned virus (which has 18 or more off-spring according
to Patricia Hoffman's VSUMX205.

Either your two different scanners are picking up different pieces of
code VI-Spy recognizing a part of the code which is found in
Michelangelo and SCAN (which version?) picking up code which is found
in both Stoned and Michelangelo.  What you may have is a new variant
which is neither one but still detectable by scanners looking either
for the stoned or Michelangelo.  The virus hacker was not too skillful
as with just a little more work, he or she might have made it
invisible to both scanners.

Some scanning software also uses some heuristic techniques to find
families of viruses and this is what may be happening here.

Scanning is a very imperfect art as viruses can be hacked to fool
scanners.

I certainly agree that IDEALLY one would like to identify the exact
virus and be able read up about it and also have a utility to clean it
out of the system.

However, in practice, there are too many viruses coming out for any
anti-virus company to keep up, you risk not getting updates in time even
if available, cleaning is not 100%, new polymorphic viruses are
self-mutating and as they improve will become invisible to scanners and
other heuristic techniques.

Rather than look for the perfect scanner, one should accept their
limitations and only use them as gross filters for incoming software.

Generic protection virus control is essential in a modern computing
environment.  There are a number of products in this category including
TSR virus monitors and integrity checkers.

Our firm distributes Victor Charlie which can deal with all known and
unknown viruses.

Generic products do not identify the virus, they just detect it and
purge it from the system.

Topic: New Shareware anti-virus

Stiller Research announces release of Integrity Master(tm) version 1.23a

Integrity Master is ASP shareware providing complete, easy to use, data
integrity for your PC plus virus protection.  It can also be used to
provide file change management and security on your PC.  As well as
scanning for known viruses, it detects unknown viruses and unlike other
products will detect files which have been damaged but not infected by a
virus.  INTEGRITY MASTER PROTECTS YOU AGAINST ALL THREATS TO YOUR DATA
AND PROGRAMS NOT JUST VIRUSES!

This upgrade provides the following new features since version 1.22:

1) We added a new option to do nothing but scan programs in the current
   directory for known viruses.

2) The COMMANDS menu now contains an "uninstall" option to remove
   integrity data files from the directories on the current disk.  This
   allows you to easily remove protection from a disk.

3) We added three new command line options to scan files and system sectors
   for known viruses.  These parameters are:

  "/VA"  Check ALL files on a disk (not just executables).
  "/VO"  One time quick screening of programs on current disk.
  "/VR"  One time quick screening of programs in current directory.

  (REMINDER: Scanning by itself is not sufficient protection against
viruses!)

4) 35 new viruses and variants are identified by name.

Yep, Stacker does exactly this when the disk is messed up, but you need a
special program (supplied with Stacker) to properly fix it, or you can copy
everything off to diskette while you can, then reformat the disk (not low
level, just clear the partition and re-install Stacker and you backed-up
software).  But don't trust the present copy of the files on the disk!
Hopefully you have a backup of everything.

Stacker and DRDOS's SuperStore do the same thing, its just with SuperStore that
DRDOS's CHKDSK/F does the appropriate fixing (not very well, perhaps, but
consider that PKZIPFIX can't work miracles either).

So the message didn't come from a virus but I suspect the gif viewer has a bug!
The method of testing unknown programs - whether you are worried about a virus
or a bug - is to keep your valuable hard disk safe - ideally have a machine
somewhere you can practice on, or unplug your hard disk, or change the
partition table at the very least.

I see in the new PC-Week that MS-DOS 6.0 is scheduled to contain anti-
virus software from Central Point. Makes sense since MS & CP have been
working together for some time now & CP has a number of utilities in
MS-DOS 5.0.

Too bad that they have chosen the one product that is notorious for
leaving viral signatures scattered in memory though hopefully that will
be fixed by the time 6.0 comes out else MS support lines are liable to
be swamped with calls.

This is interesting in that back at the start of the year once again I sent

         The Vancouver Sun, Saturday, August 1, 1992,
              "Ocean", p. A6 (continued from "Deep Dark Secrets", p. A1)

    "If that weren't enough, the computer software meant to help guide
    ROPOS developed a virus.  To the shock of the scientists watching the
    first nerve-wracking descent, the system suddenly froze and "Your

Editors, The Sun
Fax: 732-2323

Gentlemen:

I am writing to correct some errors in your article "Deep Dark Secrets" (p. A1
and A6, Saturday, August 1, 1992).  I was quite interested in the article, and
would normally never dare to question the facts therein: oceanography is not my
field.

However, your mention of the virus in the computer needs some correction.
First of all, the "software meant to help guide ROPOS" did not "develop" the
virus.  (It was, in fact, written by a high school student in New Zealand about
four years ago.)  The virus would have been carried to the computer on a floppy
disk, probably unknowingly, by one of the people concerned with the project.
Secondly, the system did not suddenly "freeze", at least not because of the
virus.  This virus, most often referred to as "Stoned" because of the message,
does not stop systems.  (It will, with certain types of disks, overwrite the
pointers to some files.)  In all instances that I am aware of, the computer
would continue to function without interference to any programs.  Thirdly, the
message was "Your PC is now Stoned" (not "system") and it did not "flash" on
the screen.  If the message appeared at all, it was displayed when the computer
was turned on or "rebooted", and then only if a floppy disk, itself infected
with the virus, was in the A: drive of the computer at the time.

Why do I bring up these points at all?  They do not have anything to do with
the oceanographic studies.  However, the expedition could have lost valuable
data.  The tragedy would be that the virus infection could easily have been
prevented.  Unfortunately, media attention to computer viral programs is so
sparse (and so often inaccurate) that the general run of computer users have no
idea as to the danger, nor what steps to take to combat the problem.  At the
current time, a business with 200 PCs can expect to be hit by at least one new
virus infection every month, and the problem is growing rapidly.  The rapid
growth is primarily due to the fact that most computer users take no
precautions against viral programs, and those precautions are often
insufficient or directed against the wrong type of problem.

Hopefully, at some point accurate information about computer viral programs can
be promoted, and the threat will diminish almost to nothing.

This is accurate for infection of EXE files, but not for COM files.
For these the code is *prepended* to the file (at least in the case of
the original Jerusalem virus).

I agree with almost everything here, but I think it's a bit presump-
tuous to conclude that the reason for the name "1813" had anything to
do with avoiding anti-semitism.  To the best of my knowledge, this
name was first given to it by Alan Solomon, who at that time (1988)
gave a numeric name, based on the size of the added code, to *all*
file viruses.

I think you're confusing the Jerusalem with another virus here.  The
above story and name fit the Frodo (= 4096) virus.  To the best of my
knowledge, they do not fit the Jerusalem.

                   The "Jerusalem" virus - part 3

Although it is difficult to be absolutely certain about
pronouncements as to the provenance and family history of viral
programs, it is almost certain that the Jerusalem virus is, in fact,
two viral programs combined.  Among the Jerusalem "family" are three
"sURIV" variants (again, named for text in the code.)  It is fairly
easy to see where "virus" 1, 2 and 3 come from.  sURIV 1.01 is a COM
file infector, COM being the easier file structure and therefore the
easier programs to infect.  sURIV 2 is an EXE only infector, and is
considerably longer and more complex code.  sURIV 3 infects both
types of program files, and has considerable duplication of code: it
is, in fact, simply the first two versions "stuck" together.

(Although the code in the sURIV programs and the "1813" version of
Jerusalem is not absolutely identical, all the same features are
present.  The date of the "payload" is April 1 in the sURIV variants.
There is also a "year" condition: some of the payload of the sURIV
variants is not supposed to "go off" until after 1988.)

Perhaps this explains the "popularity" of the Jerusalem virus as a
"template" for variants.  The code is reasonably straightforward and,
for those with some familiarity with assembly programming, an
excellent "primer" for the writing of viral programs affecting both
COM and EXE files.  (There is, of course, the fact that Jerusalem is
both "early" and "successful".  There are many copies of Jerusalem
"in the wild", and it may be simply availability that has made it so
widely copied.  Its "value" as a teaching tool may simply be an
unfortunate coincidence.)

Of course, not every virus writer who used the Jerusalem as a
template showed the same good taste and imagination in what they did
with it.  Not all of them even fixed the obvious flaws in the
original.  The "variations" tend to be quite simplistic: there are a
number of "Thursday the 12th", "Saturday the 14th" and "Sunday the
15th" programs.  (Some of the "copy cat" virus authors added errors
of their own.  One of the "Sunday" variants is supposed to delete
files on the "seventh" day of the week.  Unfortunately, or perhaps
fortunately for those of us in the user community, nobody ever
bothered to tell the author that computers start counting from zero
and Sunday is actually the "zeroth" day of the week.  The file
deletions never actually happen.)
