Subject: Michelangelo threat (PC)

With the latest announcement of Michelangelo being distributed on
BitCom disks packed with modems, it seems apparent that the spread of
this virus is getting out of hand.

Accordingly, between now and the 7th of March, 1992 I am suspending
the requirement for submission of any shareware fees for my FIX
utilities which will detect and may be used to remove the Michelangelo
virus - consider this a "free trial" period just PLEASE read the
.DOCs. The bundled FREEWARE, NoFBoot, SafeMBR, CHKMEM, CHKBOOT, and
SafeFBR may, of course, be used without restriction so long as they
are not modified in any way.

The current versions may be retrieved via Anonymous FTP from
urvax.urich.edu (141.166.1.4) as FixUtils2.zip and only these latest
versions should be used.  Permission is granted for this .ZIP to be
posted at any site.

Editorial: I am astounded that today, nearly six years after the discovery
           of the first BIOS-level infection, the OS manufacturers: MicroSoft
           and Digital Research have not yet included these simple rules
           in their products. IMHO simple addition of the SafeMBR and SafeFBR
           code to FDISK & FORMAT would rapidly stop the spread of those
           viruses currently accounting for over 50% of recorded infections.

             This virus has really surprised me. When I first say it,  my
        thought  was "yet another STONED" (and not as well written),  but
        it  seems  to  be spreading & spreading  &  spreading...  If  Rob
        Slade's estimate is right, for every report we see, there are  at
        least three other infected computers that we don't. March 6th may
        just be interesting.

             Some time ago I did a number of experiments concerning  boot
        sectors  in general since we seemed to have good protection  from
        DOS viruses but few people were working at the BIOS level  before
        DOS ever starts. IMHO, since over 50% of the reported  infections
        begin  at the BIOS level, then that is where the checking  should
        start.  The  first experiments (written in 1988) were  a  set  of
        integrity checking programs, two of which were CHKMEM and CHKBOOT
        (now FREEWARE) that could be used to detect all "common"  viruses
        -  I  presented a paper on this at last year's Virus  &  Security
        Conference  in New York (March 12 & 13 this year  call  (800)835-
        2246 x190 for info - plug).

             These  operate  from the DOS level. About two years  ago,  I
        began studying a BIOS level approach - at this point the Intel PC
        is  a fully functioning computer with access to all  peripherals,
        it is just not yet a DOS (or Unix or OS/2 or...) computer.

             The  first  result  was  the  DISKSECURE  program  that  was
        designed  as  a technology demonstrator &  performed  BIOS  level
        integrity checking and protection of the MBR, hidden sectors, and
        DOS  boot  record.  Many  researchers  seem  to  like  it  as  an
        additional layer of protection.

             DISKSECURE's biggest limitation was that it could do nothing
        about  a floppy boot (only hardware can prevent this) and  I  was
        and am convinced that a global solution had to be software  based
        - not for technical reasons but for logistical and economic ones.

             The  next  effort  was SafeMBR - a BIOS  level  Master  Boot
        Record  replacement  that  performed integrity  checking  on  the
        system  and which would halt a boot if "something" was wrong  and
        used  lessons learned in DISKSECURE to avoid conflicts  with  the
        incredible  array of disk controllers, BIOSes, and  DOS  variants
        that exist. SafeMBR is FREEWARE.

             Late  in 1991, I extended the SafeMBR concepts to a  similar
        floppy disk replacement SafeFBR to provide a generic floppy  disk
        boot record replacement with warning messages.

             Concurrently  with  SafeMBR, I addressed the  "floppy  boot"
        problem as far as possible with software, a TSR (512 bytes needed
        & can be loaded "high") was written to intercept the Ctrl-Alt-Del
        sequence  and test for a floppy in drive A. If one is found,  the
        reboot is denied. This taught me more about the inner workings of
        the BIOS and the Interrupt Controller. NoFBoot was the result and
        is also FREEWARE.

             The  final parts FixMBR and FixFBR were extensions  of  this
        concept  used  to install SafeFBR and SafeMBR. FixMBR  came  from
        hours spent disinfecting machines infected by MBR viruses and was
        designed to automate the repair based on the fact that ALL  leave
        an  intact partition table SOMEWHERE. Given an  intact  partition
        table,  all  that  is usually necessary is  to  replace  the  MBR
        program. Generally I use the SafeMBR code to do this.

             For  some time, I was hesitant to release  these  techniques
        but then along came the Azusa virus...

             FixFBR works essentially the same way except that only  four
        Boot  Parameter  Blocks are needed (does not work  with  2.88  Mb
        floppies yet). Since it also incorporates the CHKBOOT techniques,
        it will also flag potentially infected disks.

             This last is the key to the concept. None of these  programs
        (well  maybe NoFBoot) will prevent a virus infection.  What  they
        will  do  is  to  detect viruses  almost  immediately.  Flag  the
        "anomaly"  in  a  way  the user cannot  ignore,   and  provide  a
        recovery mechanism. They do not "identify 1000 viruses" but  will
        tell you that "something" has happened at the BIOS level  without
        going  resident.  They  are designed as one layer  in  a  layered
        protection (I use four layers myself).

             Similarly,   either  CHKBOOT  or  FixFBR  will  detect   the
        Michelangelo virus on floppy disks and report them as  "suspect".
        FixFBR will then remove the problem.

             To  me  this  is  a  vital  element  in  fighting  malicious
        software,  knowing  early on that "something"  has  happened  and
        isolating  the  abnormality  to as  narrow  range.  I  personally
        believe  that  if  these techniques  were  used  globally,  those
        viruses responsible for over half of reported infections: Stoned,
        Azusa,  Aircop,  Brain,  Joshi,  &  Michelangelo  would   quickly
        disappear.

             But   today  there  appears  to  be  a  very  real   threat:
        Michelangelo  that  needs to be addressed. I have never  seen  so
        many  reports  of  a  virus in so short  a  time  before  and  am
        particularly  disturbed  about  the  number  of  "shrink-wrapped"
        reports.  Consequentially, while normally I "suggest"  a  nominal
        SHAREWARE fee ($1.00) for the two "FIX" utilities, from now until
        7 March, 1992, payment requirements are suspended and they may be
        freely used, posted, & transmitted without limitation so long  as
        they are not modified.

                                           Warmly,

I believe you will find that this is due to a change in the size of
IO.sys and the option to load dos high.  Try mem /p>mem.txt and then
read mem.txt.  My Dos 5.0 book indicates 0000h to 002670h is used by
System interupt, IO and MSDOS.sys.  I think this is smaller than Dos

Subject: yet another commercial Michelangelo (PC)

The Michelangelo virus was found at the University of Alberta on a
diskette from "Meridian Data, Inc.", who seem to be involved in CD-ROM
extension software for MS-DOS systems.  The diskette was shipped
write-protected, and the infection was detected immediately.  Meridian
Data have been informed of the problem.

Is that 5 confirmed commercial distributions of Michelangelo, now?
This is beginning to smack of conspiracy.  What are the statistical
odds of one relatively dumb boot sector infector being this
"successful"?  Or do the various companies have something in common:
same supplier of pre-formatted diskettes, maybe?  Same
diskette-copying service?  Recipients of the same "Demo" disk that
required a system reboot?  Beta testers of some software that does a
reboot for installation purposes?  I find the "pure coincidence"
interpretation a bit too unlikely, though I have no statistics to
support my hunch.

Tim.

Hello Joe,

VIRUSCAN (SCAN.EXE) will check the partition table (alias MBR) for
non-standard code, but it also has a feature to check the partition
table against a checksum stored in a hidden file in the root of the
drive named SCANVAL.VAL.  If this file were not updated and SCAN was
run to check validation codes, it ouwld then report that the partition
table has been changed.  To fix this, run SCAN with the /RV option to
remove validation codes from your system, and then /AV todd new
validation codes to it.

I think, the definition both authors are proposing is too confined, or
too narrow.

Rather, the term should cover more than variable decryption routines.
I'll state my proposed definition as a FAQ list entry, so Ken can put it
into that list, if most people agree. Could a kind soul, who has a better
command of English and/or better knowledge of viruses than I have,
proof-read the following contribution, before it goes into the FAQ list?

[Moderator's note: Thanks for the FAQ submission, Otto!  The list
grows...]

Q: What is special about polymorphic viruses?  Why are they called
   "polymorphic"?

A: In order to eradicate a virus infection, all instances of this these routine
s would be plainly visible in any instance of
   the virus (e.g. the Whale virus does it this way, if I am not mis-
   taken). A signature-driven virus scanner would have to exploit several
   signatures (one for each possible encryption method) to reliably
   identify a virus of this kind.

   A more sophisticated polymorphic virus (e.g. V2P6) will vary the
   sequence of instructions in its copies, by interspersing it with
   "noise" instructions (e.g. a No Operation instruction, or an
   instruction to load a currently unused register with an arbitrary
   value), by interchanging mutually independent instructions, or even
   by using various instruction sequences with identical net effects
   (e.g. Subtract A from A, and Move 0 to A, have the same net effect).
   A simple-minded, signature-based virus scanner would not be able to
   reliably identify this sort of viruses; rather, a sophisticated
   "scanning engine" has to be constructed after a thorough research into
   the particular virus.

   The advent of polymorphic viruses has rendered virus-scanning an ever
   more difficult and expensive endeveaour; adding more and more search
   strings to simple scanners will not adequately deal with these
   viruses.

Recently, I have learned of another good term for this kind of viruses:
Alan Solomon calls them Multipartite Viruses. I think this is a rather
compelling term, as "polymorhic" is for the phenomenon I've dwelt on,
in my FAQ contribution above.

As to my understanding, the latter viruses vary their form and not their
function; hence "polymorphic" seems just appropriate.

I agree that self-encrypting viruses (e.g. Cascade) should *not* be
termed "polymorphic", if only the encryption key makes all the dif-
ference. However, there are viruses which exploit varying encryption
methods (requiring entirely different decryption routines) and/or
varying instruction sequences.

Hence, I plead to use the following terms:

* polymorphic : for viruses that produce varying instances by the
                techniques described above (unrespective of them being
                self-encrypting or not),

* multipartite: for viruses that exploit several distinct infection
                paths, and hence will be found attached to varying
                pieces of code (i.e. at least two of the following:
                program files, overlay files, program libraries,
                source programs, device drivers, boot records, etc.)

If (when?) viruses will be able to operate on various hosts, we should
coin a new term for them, perhaps something resembling the terms "cross-
compiler" and "cross-assembler".

I agree whole-heartedly! Hence, I thank Frisk for bringing up this topic
so we can discuss it, and I hope that we all can agree on a common nomen-
clature, even if some of us will have to rephrase existent text files or
message strings.

Let me take a wild guess and say that you have used Norton Utility's
Speed Disk!?  This program will create a file in the root directory of
the disk being defragmented containing information about the disk and
the name of this file is SD.INI.

Subject: Help! Michelangelo and Windows (PC)

 I have a lab of twenty 386 PC machines.
 I need some advice. I have purchased a copy of Norton Anti-Virus with
the definition of Michelangelo strain included. However, most
applications I run in this lab are Windows based.  An alarm sounds
each time I access an executable file and from a DOS prompt It asks to
proceed, innoculate. This screen is not visible from within Windows.
The alarm sounds, and you are not sure if it is a virus warning, or if
it simply wishes to innoculate a file. I can't tell if it's trying to
innoculate the same files over and over.

Is there a better way? Can anyone provide a suggestion to not only
clean up the lab, but from the autoexec and config level - pre scan
accessed files from within Windows - where you are shown what's going
on?

These alarms in the dark are driving me crazy.

Hello Lucius,

The LZ Virus was added to Version 86 of SCAN after the VIRLIST.TXT was
created so it isn't listed in the VIRLIST.TXT file.

SCAN V86 gives a false alarm on the virus, so a new release named
Version 86-B was made to fix this.  Version 86-B of the programs is
available from the wsmr-simtel20.army.mil, garbo.uwasa.fi, and
beach.gal.utexas.edu anonymous ftp sites, as well as any site that
mirrors them.

Subject: Virus Descriptions

Hello,
  Does anybody know how I can obtain a detailed description of all, or most, of
 the current viruses.
  I have a reference to a list that a Patricia M. Hoffman owns, but I have no
idea of how to get to her.

  If anyone can help, I would be grateful,

  Thanks,
     Colin.
