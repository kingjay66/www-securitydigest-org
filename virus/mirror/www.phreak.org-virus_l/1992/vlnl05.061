Subject: System clocks on PS/2 Model 30 (PC)

I know that this post does not really belong here but I discovered
this due to the MICH virus.

The IBM PS/2 model 30 computer system clock is not programmed for Feb.
the 29th.  Hence on the 5th of March when I wanted to change the date
just for extra precaution I noticed that the computer was already on
the 6th of March.  Hence there was no use changing the date and as
nothing had happened I was relieved.  We have about 6 of these
computers and all of them had the same problem.....Therefore there are
computers on the market which have defective system clocks........

Subject: Frodo PC

Although I rarely believe the people on the news today, I just heard a
supposed expert say that on Sept. 21 a virus called Frodo would hit.
No big deal, but he also said that It could not be detected by virus
scanners. period.  Any truth to these claims?

Subject: If I use stacker on my hard disk (PC)

    Hi

    If I use stacker on my hard disk (which compress all your files in
hard disk and leave more space for you) So I scan my hard disk several
time, and I found nothing (with scan86 and CPAV the lastest release).
And and I got a virus, which change all my pointer to file in
partition talbe. and I can not boot my disk any more So I formatted
all my hard disk.

My Question is, if I use stacker, does scan86 or CPAV can detect virus
with compressed file ??

Thanx
Bum.

Subject: Michelangelo virus (PC)

Hello, there, I started read this group yesterday, and am going to ask
a few questions here, please forgive me for ignorant.
My questions are about the  Michelangelo virus:
(1) is it because some hackers send it to the network on the special day(Mar. 6
),
	or is it a virus stored in the floppy somewhere that explodes on Mar. 6
?
(2) How does it affect you PC and disk? Why doesn't it affect MAC or, SUN?
(3) What is the working mechanism of this virus, how does it spread?
(4) could I get these kind of information from somewhere?

all comments are welcomed, thanks in advance!!!

The "CAPS LOCK" behaviour was present in 386 -12/16 machines running
MS-DOS 4.0 and MS-DOS 3.30, running resident "History" (which keeps
the last 20? commands interpreted by command.com), after removing the
history the problem vanished. It has sense to somebody?

P.D. I miss pointed out that usual keyboard behaviour was  recovered
if you press "SHIFT"+F3; but after a while the problem return.

Some software are delivered with a floppy without tab, thus they are
write protected and someone wrote on them!

I use to think that write protection was just a software protection.
After looking the IBM PC (not PS) technical reference listing for
diskette, I found no software check for write protection.  Thus, in
"recent" PCs, write protection will likely be hardware.  But, were not
the older PCs and some clones, designed with software protection for
diskette?  Thus, a virus could on some PC or clones move on a
write-protected floppy.  Or am I wrong or are my souvenir outdated?
Software dealers may modify their hardware...

: There is no info with F-PROT that describes an SBC virus.  I noticed

:
: Is there an SBC virus?  If so, where can I find a description of it?

We've come up with multiple instances where F-Prot flagged a file as
infected with the SBC virus.  I have not yet heard of a case where
more than one file on a machine was flagged as infected [which says to
me that (1) SBC is relatively benign, at least in how it spreads, OR
(2) F-Prot is generating false positive ID's on SBC infections].

One file that many users have had flagged as infected with SBC is part
of Natural Connection, some mainframe connectivity software from
Software AG in Germany.  The person here who deals with their software
has contacted Software AG, who tell him that the SBC virus originated
in Germany, and that it does typical file infector stuff - loads into
memory, may affect file linkages, ....  They claim what they
distribute has not been infected.  They use McAfee's SCAN to check for
infections.  The file in question (the name of which I don't have at
hand) has come in various versions.  Version 2.2 and 3.22 get flagged
as infected with SBC by F-Prot 2.02D.  Version 3.21 does NOT get
flagged as infected.

So it seems to me that either McAfee's SCAN is coming up with false
negatives (not recognizing SBC infections) or F-Prot is coming up with
false positives (flagging non-existent infections).

I will be sending a copy of the file in question to Fridrik Skulason,
author of F-Prot, and will include a second file flagged as infected
if the user who told me of it still has a copy and sends it to me.

I also found No-Int (with Stoned) on 15 out of 50 PCs.  I'm not sure
about what it does.  I pushed the date ahead to Fri. the 13th
(3/13/92) and nothing happened.

Maybe Stoned/No-Int is corrupted.  Can I get my money back?

Has anyone seen a virus that will not allow "scan" to be run?  When I
type a:scan I get bad command or filename.  When I type dir a:scan*.*
I get file not found.  When I type dir a:, scan is present.  Sounds
like something weird to me.

BTW: This pc is running DR Concurrent Dos, IBM PS/2 mod 50

Any Ideas?

Subject: McAfee 8.3B86 and EDV - *HELP* (PC)

I can't seem to get rid of the EDV virus on my PC. I am using McAfee's
Scan/Clean 8.3B86 software. The virus is showing up in my active
memory but not in any of my files on the hard disk, according to Scan.
Here are the details:

1. I ran Scan (scan c:) and it discovered the [Invader] virus in my
   active memory.

2. Scan c: /nomem /a revealed no viruses on hard disk files.

3. Clean c: [Invader] /m /chkhi yielded a report that active memory was
   infected by [V800], [Carioca], [Loz], [Invader], [EDV], and [Ohio]
   viruses, but no files were reported with viruses found.

4. Powered down and rebooted system with clean floppy with neutered
   config.sys (files=20, buffers=20) and autoexec.bat (prompt and path
   only) files.

5. Ran scan c: /m /a /chkhi and found no viruses in active memory or
   in files.

6. Powered down again and did regular boot-up from hard drive. Ran Scan
   again. Lo and behold, found [EDV] in active memory again!!

7. Powered down (again) and rebooted with clean floppy. Scan again found
   no virus in memory or in files.

8. Powered down again, rebooted normally from hard disk. Scan finds [EDV]
   again!

WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE?

I tried running Clean c: [EDV] /a /m /chkhi. But it stopped after checkin
g the memory and didn't check any of the files! How come?

I am admittedly new to the virus-busting game, so I may be missing
something here, but it seems to me that the [EDV] virus is on my
hard disk somewhere and Clean won't kill it. Autoexec.bat/config.sys
seem to reinitialize the virus into my active memory. How, I don't know.

Can anyone help me figure out what is going on here and how I can fix it?
Also, what are the dangers of the [EDV] virus?

Oh yes, the only indication of a virus problem seems to be that when I
try to run certain programs from DOS, I get a "Packed file is corrupt"
error message. But when I power down and reboot with the clean floppy,
everything runs fine!

Please help me if you can. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
Please send email and I will post a summary to the group.

Thanks in advance...

Subject: dir-2 virus (PC)

I was checking several computers for the Mich. virus when I came
across the Dir II virus on a couple of machines.  One is a IBM PS/2
model 50 running DOS 3.3 with a 20 Mb HD.  The other is a IBM PS/2
Model 70 running DOS 4.0 with a 120 Mb HD and running Blue Max memory
manager.

Both F-Prot and Scan86 detected this virus.  On the 50 F-Prot did a
good job of removing the virus.  However, using Clean86 on the 70
resulted in the machine locking up.  Using F-prot, the virus was
removed but several files, mostly Blue Max, were not cleaned due to
some kind of "compression".  Upon use Norton disk doctor, it was
discovered that several sectors were cross referenced, this left for a
very confused HD.

I had virus checked each of these machines a couple of weeks ago, so
this is a recent infection.  I have yet to discover the culprit.

Does anyone have experience with the DIR II virus?  What does it do?
Is it a normal occurance for the McAfee program to crash on certain
virus or circumstances?  I will have to reinstall DOS and the Blue Max
programs.  Should I worry about the other .exe programs that were not
processed?

Subject: Friday the 13th info (Mich. date) (PC)

	I was told by several people that Michelangelo would
trigger(Format the Disk), on the 6th of March only.  Is this the only
date that it would trigger, or is it the date that from then on it
would perform the formatting.  In other words, are the people who have
set the date on their PC's forward by one day(skipping 3/6/92), immune
from Michelangelo until the end of 3/5/93?  Basically nobody could
give me a definite answer on that, other than comparing the triggering
method with other viruses, and concluding that it would be acting like
the older viruses like Jerusalem or DataCrime.  I read also that it
would look at the CMOS clock to trigger, but is there any other
evidence.

	Also, note that Jerusalem virus does trigger on every Friday
the 13th, however, as far as I know that virus has been rather
controlled.  The attached document is a list of some of the Friday the
13th viruses that I have found in my older documents.  I do not
remember the original sources and their validity, and some of the info
may be out of date, but still they might prove to be helpful.

Hi VIRUS-L readers, Keith

Below are a few new signatures to add to the VSIG9201 signature list.
They are embedded in an original message from the VSIG maintainer.

VSIG can be used by the following scanners:

  - TBSCAN (current version 3.2)
  - TBSCANX (current version 3.0)
  - HTSCAN (current version 1.6)

All files are available from SIMTEL20 and mirror sites.

On March 15 and November 1, the "Grain of Sand" virus (also known as
the Maltese Amoeba or Irish virus), will corrupt your harddisk by
overwriting the FAT and directory. The signature for this virus is not
in the latest release of VIRSCAN.DAT, so I'm posting the info her.
The virus uses random encryption, so we need multiple signatures to
detect it:

It is there now!  Also, for us more mundane, postscript-less people, it is
also in plain ascii-text, which, believe it or not, some people prefer!

That may be slight hyperbole.  DR-DOS does include virus protection,
and incidentally, a compression scheme.  There is little motivation
for a virus writer to include code to bypass such sparsely distributed
code.  It is the sixty million systems out there with no protection
that make up the population of interest to virus writers.

Note that there is no rememdy available to the operating system writers
that will have any impact in this population in the short run, even if
they gave it away.  Look at the acceptance of all the free virus
protection software that is already available.  The use of this is very
sparse, even compared to the use of fee software, much less compared to
operating systems.

Perhaps we will never stop looking for magic for dealing with this
problem, but neither the bios nor the operating system are it.
They are simply not as universal as we think of them as being.  While
they should provide protection and while they will protect individual
systems, they will not in themselves stem the epidemic.  We will have
viruses as long as we have diskettes and that promises to be a decade or
more.

You can dload SCANV86B.ZIP and CLEANV86B.ZIP from the Carnegie Hall
BBS at 913-832-1011 at 14.4k baud, V32bis, V32, HST, V42B, etc.!! (we
run on a 14,400 baud USRobotics Dual Standard modem).  I only get the
virus detection programs DIRECT from MacAffeee.  It's quite nice...

Hi!

I just uploaded the following two programs to oak.oakland.edu:

tbscan32.zip
tbscnx30.zip

They replace the following files in /pub/msdos/trojan-pro:

tbscan31.zip
tbscnx29.zip

Together with the signature list uploaded a few days ago,
the descriptions are as follows:

TBSCAN32.ZIP Thunderbyte Virus Scan 3.2; needs VSIGyyxx.ZIP
TBSCNX30.ZIP Thunderbyte XScan v3.0 TSR; needs VSIGyyxx.ZIP
VSIG9201.ZIP Virus signatures for HTSCAN/TBSCAN - v92#01

Subject: Sent me E-mail lately ?

As everyone in the anti-virus field knows, the past two weeks have
been a bit crazy - to say the least.

A personal side-effect of this is that I have hardly been able to
reply to my E-mail the past days, and there are now 400+ messages
sitting here and waiting for a reply.

So, if you have sent me E-mail and not received a reply - don't worry
- - it did not get lost....

However, I am leaving today for the New York - plan to take a few days
off before the virus conference starts...so I will not reply to any
E-mail at all until the middle of this month.

One final comment - F-PROT 2.02 will report a false alarm (AIDS) in
the Pro-Cite, Pro-Search and Biblio-link programs....my apologies -
that's the problem with virus scanners - false positives are
practically impossible to avoid...every scanner I know of has reported
them at one time or another.
