"Come on now" yourself!  You know very well that the day after I wrote
the lines which you quote at the top, I published a clarification ex-
plaining that I did not mean "fastest" in an absolute sense, but the
fastest *practically secure* mode, and that I conceded that since I
would never be able to convince you that IM's quick update does not
meet that requirement while UT's does, I was withdrawing my former
claim concerning relative speed.  Moreover, you know very well that I
sent you a personal copy of that clarification and that you acknow-
ledged it!!  So why are you now, a week after my clarification, rever-
ting to what you know very well is not what I intended????

Absolutely, if you request it.

Just why do you decide that "UT's quick check will miss this"?  In the
great majority of infections, it won't miss it even on a single run.
And if it does, it will eventually be picked up because of the fact
that the quick check actually does a full check on a random 10% of the
viruses.  (Btw, I like Vesselin's suggestion of making this percentage
selectable by the user.)

First of all, I don't see that *you* say anywhere that *IM* cannot de-
tect such a virus, although what I wrote above is just as true for IM
as for UT.  Did you ever think of such a virus?
  Secondly, I state for the third time that I have not seen FGS's ads.
However, Vesselin has stated:
 >Oh, the guys from the marketing company did a pretty good job! They
 >wrote: "Only Untouchable guarantees 100% safe recovery of infected

What you have claimed is that this might be interpreted to mean that
UT can be relied upon to provide recovery of all infected files.  Ok,
so please take your complaint to FGS, not to me.  I'm a satisfied
user of UT, not the defense attorney for FGS's advertising dept.,
though you seem to be trying to force me into that position.


  From an earlier reply of yours to Vesselin:
>IM has the quick check for a totally different reason than UT's.
>Actually IM calls it a "quick integrity update".  This does not do a
>sampling as UT does, but provides a fast way to do a full check of all

Since almost all viruses preserve the date and time, that means it
will not detect viruses which do not change the file size, i.e. those
(like Number of the Beast) which hide the increase behind the eof
mark, those (like ZeroHunt) which inhabit stack space, and those (not
yet in existence?) which compensate for an increase in size by com-
pressing the file.  (Of course, that's also true for stealth and
semi-stealth viruses which are active in memory, but that's common to
all programs if booting isn't done from a clean diskette.) Admittedly,
such viruses are not very common.  However, in contrast to UT's quick
check, which eventually performs a full check on all files, the above
types of viruses will *never* be detected as long as only IM-type
quick checks are performed.  That's the main reason why I wrote that I
consider UT's quick check to be more secure than IM's quick update.

    Just now there is no any idea to increase scanners capability of checking
    polymorphic viruses. It looks like virus scanners would be removed from
    front line of battle against viruses. It seems to me that there is time
    for non-traditional methods for preventing virus infection. I made some
    testing of what would be if I can change some codes of MS-DOS resident
    part to make it more virus-safe.

    First idea was to make ReadOnly attribute stronger. I wrote a little
    program that makes changes in MSDOS.SYS (in memory, of course, not
    in disk file). After that nobody can remove ReadOnly attribute (it
    receives error code: Access denied), so it can't infect files with this
    attribute set via file operations (open file, write to file, close file).
    More than that, you can freely set or remove all other file attributes
    except ReadOnly. For info purposes my program also writes red border
    on EGA/VGA display if somebody tries to remove ReadOnly.
    It is possible in my program (called RLock) to restore old MS-DOS
    attributes manipulations if you really need to do something with protected
    by this method files (for examle, to delete it or move).

    Results were surprising - nearly 95% of viruses were unable to infect
    files after setting RLock defence. Some of them even didn't try to remove
    Readonly and failured, other failured with removing and very intellectual
    viruses that used tracing Int 21 chain to jump directly into MS-DOS
    Int 21h routine failured too because RLock protection of ReadOnly attribute
    became a part of MS-DOS itself.

    And what about 5%? These viruses used direct access to disk via Int 13h
    or DOS internal tables to infect files without removing ReadOnly attribute.
    I used the second idea to prevent their deeds: wrote another programm
    modifying IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS that can prevent direct access to disk
    to all programs EXCEPT COMMAND.COM. As a result disk is opened for any
    standart file IO (open, close, write, read) and any file editors and
    compilers work correctly, but it is WRITE PROTECTED for direct writing
    to it. And also I filled this programm with trips that can make impossible
    for virus to access DOS internal tables. If anybody tries to do it,
    resident part of my second programm (called HDD - Hard Disks Defender)
    returnes COPY of the DOS table with incorrect values in critical fields.

    RLock and HDD are DOS-depended and were written for MS-DOS 4.0, 4.01
    and 5.0.
    As a result only very DOS-depended viruses can ignore this defence.
    I don't know such viruses just now, but even if anybody can write them,
    these viruses can die with the next MS-DOS version because of their
    DOS-dependence.

    I think that idea of writing of virus defence as native part of DOS has
    future. Anti-viral packets can be simply modified and quickly sent to
    PC users when new DOS version was upgraded, while viruses have long way
    to their "users".

    And what are you thiking about it?

	Please answer these questions for a new computer owner.

	1.  If I set the attribute of all files on disk to read only,  would
        that trip any known/popular virus that trying to infect say command.com

        (i. e. dos would say *.com readonly    message alert me to
       	virus present).

    	2.  Can virus infect  any file extension or just .com and .exe?

	3.  Can virus infect( not destroy)  a disk with no .com and .exe
        files and no bad sector

	4.  Can virus infect a nonbootable floppy with only .zip file with no
        bad sector ?

  Did you ever del the command.com in the root directory?   Take 3 weeks
to find/learn that only dos 3.3 or above can access 40meg partition HD
when I first buy a computer.

Subject: Queries about F-Prot 2.02D (PC)

I    find  that  (running  in  interactive  mode) I only get a report if
something "suspicious" was found.  It doesn't appear to consider  packed
files  as  "suspicious",  so  there  is no mention of them being present
*unless* I have some sort of problem, eg viruses present or some kind of
"invalid" file.  When I *do* get a report, it notes all the PKLITE, DIET
and EXEPACK files as "not scanned".  I thought  2.02D  was  supposed  to
scan  such  compressed  files - is this a bug in the reporting, or is it
really not scanning them?

Personally, I think that all files genuinely not scanned should *always*
appear in a report, regardless of whether or not  F-Prot  "thinks"  that
there was a "problem".

Also, I notice that some of the viruses in the "information" browser are
picked-out in yellow, and these ones  have  an  asterisk  against  their
names  when  you  look  at  the  accompanying  text.  Any idea what this
represents?  Didn't notice any link between them.  Couldn't see anything
in the documentation about it (don't think it's been updated for 2.02D).

Subject: The word 'Cascade' in my hardware ?? (PC)

I just recently got Norton Utilties Version 6.0, while checking out all
the new features, I noticed on System Info under the 'Hardware Interrupts'
the following:

Number   Address   Name                       Owner
 -----  ---------  -------------------------  ---------------

IRQ 00  1934:003C  Timer Output 0             DOS System Area
IRQ 01  1934:0045  Keyboard                   DOS System Area
IRQ 02  F000:1F1A  [Cascade]                  BIOS
IRQ 03  F000:1F1A  COM2                       BIOS

Cascade ? Cascade the virus ?
This was on a 286, IBM PS/2 Model 30. I checked it out (With Norton 6) on
a friends 386. Same thing. So I scanned the memory for the text 'Cascade'.
Sure enough I found it, but thats about all it was....the word 'Cascade'....
just sitting in my memory. I booted up from a clean floppy. And it was still
there. I'm not worried, nothings wrong with my computer and I doubt
a simple virus like Cascade could be in my ROM, but it sure is intriqing.
I also checked it out with Norton 5.0 and PCTools but it failed to show it.
Is this some Norton 6.0 thing ? Any info on this would be appreciated.
Thanks.........

This is why my FixMBR takes a different approach, looking at the P-Table,
determining its validity, and (preferably though at the users option)
replacing all of the code. The major differences between FDISK/MBR and
FixMBR is that the SafeMBR code adds BIOS integrity checking to the boot
process and, unlike FDISK, FixMBR looks at more than just the first sector
for valid partition tables.

Again, code operating from the BIOS level can do this kind of checking
without such risks (ask Rob Slade), it is only after DOS has loaded that
the path gets murkey. IMHO BIOS code can establish such hardware paths,
authenticate them, establish system integrity at this point, and pass such
information onto software loading after the OS.

Further, since disk compression drivers often make it impossible to check
they system files, boot record, MBR, or even CONFIG.SYS  safely or
reliably from the DOS level, such BIOS checking will become even more
necessary in the future (only been pushing it for two years now).

- ----------------------

Having said that, I would like to solicit some help. As you know FixFBR
is unbootable repair for floppy disk boot records. Like FixMBR, it does
not trust code on an infected disk, instead replacing the entire boot
record, generating the BPB from scratch if necessary.

My current project (code named "FixDBR") will complete the loop by
providing code replacement with virus detection to bootable disks
both hard and floppy. The code is complete and I have tested (so far)
with fourteen different DOS variants ranging from PC-DOS 2.10 to MS-DOS
5.0 and intermediate stops at Compaq, Zenith, & DRI.

What I have discovered is that unlike most MBRs where the termination
status is easy, Boot Records are liable to expect particular values to
be left in memory and in the registers. There is enough difference that
for example a boot record configured for Compaq 3.31 will hang a Zenith
3.30+ OS and turnabout even though both call their first system file
IBMBIO.SYS so a small custom "termination" module is necessary.

The problem is that while it can handle all OSs that I have seen, samples
are needed of the "off-brands" to ensure compatability. In particular,
I need the European "ERS" and "P16" variants (the first hidden file is
called ERSBIO.COM for the first and P16BIO.COM for the second. I do not
know if there is more than one variant of each or what DOS # they are
analogous to.

If anyone on V-L has copies of these, I do not need the whole thing
(though a formatted, bootable floppy with COMMAND.COM, FORMAT.*, and
DEBUG.* or equivalent would be welcome). What I need is:

1) Name of the Operating System
2) Ascii dump of the DOS boot record (NOT the MBR if from hard disk)
3) Name, size, and date of the first hidden system file (*BIO.COM or *IO.SYS)
4) Ascii dump of the first executable sector of the above file
   (may start with a Jump - I need the initial code that is executed).
5) When booted, what does the "ver" command return ?

UUencoded Zips are the easiest way to E-Mail. I can also handle TeleDisk
or SendDisk (can be very small if a newly formatted bootable 360k floppy
disk is used containing only programs (COMMAND, DEBUG, & FORMAT) described
above and then ZIPped).

In particular, I would appreciate such copies of those systems for which
a generic anti-viral remover (such as M-DISK) has *failed* OTHER than the
Zenith varients (I have them). In any event I should be able to release
a "beta" RSN.

This is my experience. Michelangelo generated lots of interest in
virus protection here. Thanks to Frisk's F-Prot, we could easily
afford to give virus checkers to all PC users here. In the few weeks
before March 6 we found plenty of Stoned, Yankee Doodle and Forms
viruses--but no Michelangelo. We even found a number of other critical
problems (no working floppy drive, corrupted DOS programs, general
confusion about PC fundamentals) which we were able to identify and
fix. (Well, I'm sure there is still plenty of confusion about the PC.)

Thanks to the publicity about Michelangelo we raised general awareness
about viruses here--at least for now. However, if people had used
programs which only detect Michelangelo (and some probably did) we
would not have found the real virus and other problems our PC users
face.

This would not be effective against stealth BSIs unless there is
additional security checking.  To the best of my knowledge, there are,
as yet, no polymorphic BSIs.

Yes.  Padgett Peterson's DISKSECURE, FixMBR and SafeMBR work along the

necessary.  I have not, as I said, fully reviewed AAVIRUS, but at

This is indded a false alarm, as you suspected - Version 2.02 of F-PROT
did produce some false alarms:

      "Possibly a new variant of Sylvia" in TUTOR.COM (Word Perfect 4.2)
      "Shirley" (Quick Scan), in DIET 1.10A overlay-mode compressed files.
      "SBC" in several small EXE files.
      "Yaunch" (Quick Scan) in a few programs.
      "AIDS" in a few programs from Personal Bibliographic Software

The reason was basically that in 2.02 I rewrote my scanning "engine"
completely from scratch, and a few problems slipped in...they were all
corrected, and no false alarms have been reported from users of the
current version (2.03a)

I just hauled it down and had a look at it.  It simply doesn't deal with
stealth at all.  If I do a checksum, then infect the system with a
stealthy Empire virus, then use aavirus to test the system, it claims
the system is ok.  The same thing happens if I install DiskSecure in
the interim, since Disk Secure uses similar "stealth" methods to protect
the Main Boot Record.

The other serious shortcoming is that if a boot sector virus is already
in the MBR when aavirus is "installed", the program happily makes a chksum
that is dependent on the virus.  This is not good, and not necessary.
The program does have one or two lines in the documentation telling the
user to first scan for known viruses, before "installing".  It should
do some checking of its own, as well, though.

Subject: Possible SYSMAN trojan horse (VAX/VMS)

	This warning came across my desk today from our security
people.  I have typed it in verbatim.

SUBJ: COMPUTER VIRUS WARNING
1.  A POTENTIAL TROJAN HORSE EXISTS WHICH INFECTS THE SYSMAN.EXE
UTILITY ON VAX/VMS SYSTEMS.
2.  THE SYSMAN.EXE TROJAN HORSE WILL PROVIDE A KNOWLEDGEABLE USER
WITH A BACK DOOR INTO THE VMS OPERATING SYSTEM AND INCREASE USER'S
PRIVILEGES.
3.  DETECTION METHODS:
          A. CHECK FOR A LIBRARY ENTRY -
SYSDOLLAR SIGNLIBRARY:OBJ.EXE
          B. THE LENGTH OF SYSDOLLAR SIGNSYSTEM:SYSMAN.EXE EQUALS
             166 BLOCKS
          C. EXECUTE THE FOLLOWING VMS COMMAND:
       DOLLAR SIGNANALYZE/IMAGE SYSDOLLAR SIGNSYSTEM:SYSMAN.EXE
                 CHECK THE IMAGE IDENTIFICATION INFORMATION SECTION.
                 MAKE SURE FIELD IMAGE NAME EQUALS SYSMAN, NOT VA6
4.  NOTE:  ANY OF THE ABOVE COULD INDICATE THE PRESENSE OF THE SYSMAN
           TROJAN HORSE.

Comments:

	It is interesting how someone tried to translate some special
characters into english verbs and made this message much harded to
read.

	The things to check are the existance of a file
sys$library:obj.exe.  The author also mentions checking the size of
the sys$system:sysman.exe file to make sure it is 166 blocks.  While
sysman.exe may have been 166 blocks long for a previous release of
VMS, currently under VMS 5.4-2 it is 192 blocks long.  The VMS 5.3
version is 179 blocks long.  Not a very good check.

	The third way to detect the trojan mentioned should have read:

$ analyze/image sys$system:sysman.exe

That might be a good check to see if it was linked as the program
SYSMAN or VA6.

	I have no direct knowledge of this reported trojan horse.  I
am simply passing along information given to me in the interest of
computer security.

Subject: Does anyone know what are companies doing about viruses?

Hi, I am writing a paper about the virus scare. In particular I would
like to get information on:

1) past trends: a general history of where viruses came from
2) current: who's creating viruses now (a friend told me Bulgaria !)
3) what are corporations doing to protect themselves
4) and finally, what should corporations be doing?

I realize it may be hard to explain, but I am very interested in what
steps companies take to prevent spreading a virus through their
products.

Does anyone have answers to the above questions, or have any
suggestions on where to find answers for them?

I would like to give credit where it is due, so all suggestions unless
accompanied by an anonymity request, will be properly cited to
whomever responds.

Responses can be to me via e-mail (preferred since it will make it
easier for me to track who said what) or through this group.

Thanks very much in advance...

Maybe I am missing something, but I fail to see the value in
cataloging the source of all incoming diskettes for later use in
tracking the source of virus infections.  It seems to me that a scan
of all incomming diskettes will reveal any known viruses and prevent
an infection in the first place.

Once the diskettes are delivered to users across the company, the
actual source of a virus infection could be any machine that the disk
touches, providing that the disk is not write-protected.  Therefore,
if you really wanted to track the source and history of a virus
infection, you would need to keep a record of every machine which
every disk touches.  This is not a viable tool.

I believe that a better approach to tracking virus infections is to
use principals of epidemiology to trace possible infections.  See "The
Application of Epidemiology to Computer Viruses" by Bill Murray in the
Procedings of the Fourth Annual Computer Virus and Security
Conference.

In actual practice, it is not always easy to trace the infection path
without missing a disk, or, more commonly, without loosing the scent.
My experience has been to trace an infection back one or two machines
before loosing the scent.  If you can't trace the infection back to
where it entered the organization, it will always come back to haunt
you.  When this hapens, you can pick up the scent again and try to
find the source.  In an organization with thousands of computers which
share media across multiple locations, the task becomes very
interesting to say the least.  Add to all this a large network and you
have a headache.

Subject: International virus symbol..

I have had a bigger reponse than I expected to the virus symbol stuff
so...  The virus symbol is now available in .PCX .BMP .EPS and .GIF
formats. Mail me for a uuencoded copy of the .ZIP file. Also the virus
symbol in any of it's format is (C) Copyright 1992 Vaughan Bell but is
released into the public domain so it can be copied, printed,
distributed or whatever free of charge.

Also I have been told that people have had trouble printing the
PostScript file, It was produced from Harvard Graphics 2.6 and
exported to postscript. So if any one has had problems mail me for a
new copy, this should hopefully work...

Personally, I like the standard "biohazard" symbol (a vertical line
and two lines at 120-degree angles, each splitting into two curved
lines) as a symbol for computer viruses.  The meaning is reasonably
unambiguous -- there is very likely not any literal biohazard
associated with a computer diskette.

Hello Everyone!

	It is with great pleasure that I make the following
announcement. Thanks to Ken van Wyk, eugene.gal.utexas.edu
(129.109.9.21) now carries almost all of the anti-viral and
security-related documents and software found on cert.sei.cmu.edu.
This is in addition to the latest in anti-viral software. As part of
the re-organization, the anti-viral software can be found in
/pub/virus-software rather than /pub/virus. If you encounter any
problems accessing the new files, please send mail to
perry@eugene.gal.utexas.edu.

Subject: New Integrity Master (PC)

 Stiller Research announces release of Integrity Master version 1.12b

Integrity Master(tm) provides complete, easy to use, data integrity for
your PC plus virus protection. It can also be used to provide file
change management and security on your PC.  As well as scanning for
known viruses, it detects unknown viruses and unlike other products
(such as McAfee's scan) will detect files which have been damaged
but not infected by a virus.

New with V1.12:
- --------------
  Version 1.12b recognizes over 50 additional viruses by name (since
  V1.11a).

  For people who want to run totally unattended or who don't want to have
  to hit a key to acknowledge serious problems, we have added the /NE
  (Nonstop except for Emergencies) command line parameter and halt option.

  IM does additional consistency checking between the files themselves
  and their associated directory entries.  This allows detection of
  missing or incorrectly chained clusters even if IM has never been used
  before on the disk.

  The programs SETUPIM.EXE and IM.EXE are now further compressed for use
  on smaller disks.

  Unattended (batch) checking runs faster.

Integrity Master V1.12b was released on March 18th and should by now be
available on most systems. It is available on all SDN and ASP afiliated
BBSes as well as SIMTEL-20 here on internet.
