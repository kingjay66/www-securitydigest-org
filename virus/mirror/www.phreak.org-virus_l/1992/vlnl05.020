Good summary of the situation!  We always use "MBR" for the MBR around
here, so I like the choice of term...  *8)

One tiny extra complication: I believe that the secondary boot sectors
(the ones that the MBR loads) sometimes behave just like the MBR does;
that is, they divide up the space that they own into still more
partitions, and load and pass control to yet another level of boot
sector.  I've never had this confirmed directly, but of course since
those boot sectors can do anything at all, they can certainly do this.
The important question is whether or not the third-level boot sectors
can get infected by any existing virus; I think the answer is no, but
I'm not sure (It would also be nice to know if DOS ever does this,
with "logical partitions" for instance, or if it's just theoretically
possible.)

We tend to use "System Boot Sector" for this, since that's the boot
sector that actually loads an operating SYSTEM.  An even less
ambiguous term, for when confusion is likely, would be "Operating
System Boot Sector".  Although that's a little long for everyday use.
OSBS?  *8)

Subject: .SYS Infector Mentioned In Ferbrache's Book (PC)

I'd asked about .SYS infectors in an earlier post. I came across a
mention of one in David Ferbrache's new book (A Pathology Of Computer
Viruses).  This .SYS infecting virus was called Pac-Man (makes a
pacman character that eats characters on the screen). It infected
MSDOS.SYS and was reported to this list by its author, Roger Gonzalez.
Time frame for this was around 1988 it appears. The virus was never
released. Apparently its purpose was only to demonstrate the
feasiblity of .sys infectors.

Hmmm. I wonder if I feel motivated enough to poke through the archives
of this list to find this old reference... :)

If anyone has any documentation about this virus, please let me know.

Just like to add some experience with recently putting DOS 5.0 on my
machine.

I noticed when running DOS 3.3 on my IBM PS/2 Mod50Z that chkdsk used to
report 654336 of memory.  Now, with DOS 5.0, CHKDSK reports 655360.
I don't really know what the cause of this was, and I'm not too
interested in finding out (now that I'm DOS 5, I plan to wipe out
all my DOS 3 bootable utility floppies, and recreate them with DOS 5).

More interesting, though, is the new MEM command available with DOS 5.
When I run MEM, it reports 655360 total conventional memory, and
654336 bytes available to IBM DOS.  Since I'm reasonably sure that my
DOS distribution diskettes were clean (and write protected), and I
know I haven't booted from a floppy since installing DOS 5, I am
reasonably sure that my system is not infected.  F-Prot 2.01 also reports
that the system is fine.  However, the F-MMAP program from F-Port 1.16
reports 654336 (639K) base memory.  This could be because it is talking
to DOS, and not the hardware.  The memory allocation analysis part of
F-Prot 2.01 doesn't reveal anything abnormal.

Does anyone have enough experience with DOS 5 to explain this 1K
discrepancy (Padgett?) ?

Stoned (or at least Stoned-E) displays its message according to the
following:

        1.  If the machine was booted from an infected floppy, and
        2.  If the timer byte at 0000:046C is 07.

So, for all boots from infected floppies, this has the effect of
displaying the message in a pseudo-random pattern, averaging about 1
out of every 8 boots.  This number matches what I have seen, both
experimentally and "in the wild."  However, the hard disk will be
infected following ANY boot from an infected floppy.

If the machine is booted from an infected hard drive, the message is
never displayed.

Hope this answers your questions.

Subject: virus or hardware failure ? (PC)

Hi, folks.

I'm having a problem with my PC and I'm wondering if I've got a virus.
Lately I've had problems running certain programs which had been
running fine.  These programs fail with illegal instructions (trapped
by QEMM) or they just won't load.

The problems have been getting progressively worse.  And yesterday, my
floppies died and the whole machine now locks up if I hit "Num Lock".
I figured it must be hardware failure or a virus, but hardware diags
and McAfee Scan don't report anything unusual.

I also thought it might be a UMB conflict, but I removed QEMM and it
still croaks.

Any clues ?  Does this sound like a familiar virus to you ?

Thanks!

Subject: Flip Virus and Prof. Brunnstein (PC)

In light of the recent conflict between Fprotect and CPAV I decided I
was interested in getting more information about the Flip virus.

I was astonished to find that it's not contained in the copies of
Prof. Brunnsteins virus list at cert.sei.cmu.edu, nor at any of the
other ibm-anti-viral sites.  Does anyone out there know where I can get
a complete up-to-date version of this list?  Does anyone know where I
can get a good description of the Flip virus?

Additionaly, where are Patricia Hoffmann's virus lists at?  Are they not
available as shareware?  I know this has likely already been covered in
Virus-L but my memory is only so good :-)

Thanks very much in advance for replying to my post.

These would actually refer to the same thing only that the PBR (I like
Logical Boot Sector or LBR better)

The following applies only to a DOS system though I would expect similar
constructs to exist in OS/2 and Unix for Intel platforms.

DOS Boot Record (DBR)     : The first logical sector of a DOS partition
                            (first logical is also the first physical sector
                             on most floppies)
                            Contains the BPB (Boot Parameter Block - analagous
                             to the partition table) and Boot Record Code

DOS Boot Record Code      : Executable code found in the first logical sector
                            of a DOS partition. If the partion is to be used
                            for booting (is ACTIVE partition), it must conform
                            to DOS specifications.

DOS BPB                   : Data table found at a specified location in the
                            first logical sector of a DOS partition that

One of my clients has a contract which specifies that some VMS

checking that to the best of our ability. (Like Norton Anti Virus for
VMS). Its obvious to me that such a package would not be foolproof,
but at least it would show a prudent man effort. I have heard of one
VMS DECnet worm, but no viruses, and I would be interested if anybody
had heard of a VMS virus. Please email responses and I will summarize,

Vesselin makes an excellent description of logic (which I haven't entirely
gone through, yet) but do wish to reiterate a simple concept.

Computers are designed to run programs. Viruses are programs. e.g. Computers
are designed to run viruses. - Old Adage

Viruses perform actions which SHOULDN'T occur during normal computer operation
except in special cases. - My thought.

Viruses cause changes - its in their charter.

Therefore, viruses ARE detectable by looking for changes (or attempted changes)
that should not occur.

The basic problem with most anti-virus defenses is that they are layered on
top of the operating system while according to industry reports most infections
occur before the operating system is loaded.

For several years, I have been trying to present the concept of BIOS level
integrity management & have been giving away demonstrators, yet no-one seems
particularly interested. I do believe that if simple integrity checking were
put into the code used by FDISK and FORMAT, the spread of MBR infections
including STONED, AZUSA, AIRCOP, EMPIRE, MICHELANGELO, etc could be stopped.
Period.

   Hmm, the definition is not that bad, but I think that a more exact one

In a clinical sense your definition is correct but in reality can
apply to most "real" programs, like DOS.  When I think of a Trojan
Horse program I would think of something like the "tampered" versions
of PKZIP that were around a year or two ago.  Or a program called
soemthing like FREESEX that would lecture you about morality and lock
format your hard disk.

    I have been watching in the list the message treads on the Iraqi printer

	   1. Postscript printers receive printouts in the form of Postscript
	      Program Code, which is in turn run by the printer to printout
	      the Page. Now if that Postscript printer is on a Network and

Yes, this is entirely possible, but not very likely.  It would be
especially hard for the postscript code itself to contain a virus or
worm.  I am speculating about what could be possible with a bogus
printer.  Note that this is an entirely separate issue from the
postscript password issue.

Some types of networked postscript printers:

Appletalk - I am not an expert on the protocol and it may be that
  "printer" devices cannot legally go out on the network of their own
  accord.  But one could, in theory, mimic being a computer itself and
  alter files on connected machines.

TCP/IP Etherent (BSD spooling) - Here the printer is actually a full blown
  "host" computer as far as the network is concerned.  It could, in
  theory, use NFS, Telnet, FTP, finger, etc., and exploit whatever
  holes there are to be found.

SCSI - Not a full blown network but if the hosts system's disks are on
  the same physical bus then the printer can get at them any way it
  wants.

I suppose some people might think that the computers in Germany
