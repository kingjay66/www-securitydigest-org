Something "very similar" is the Jerusalem virus and its more than 94
different variants... :-) However, you probably have the main one. It
is memory resident, infects files when you are executing them, append
1805 bytes to the COM files (yeah, they -do- get infected) and 1813
(plus up to 15 bytes for padding) to the EXE files. The latter are
infected each time you execute them, since the virus does not mark
them as already infected.

Michelangelo and Stoned put the original boot sector at one and the
same place on hard disks and on 360 Kb floppies. They put it on a
different place on high-capacity floppies.

While I have not seen the product, I bet that is cannot disinfect "all
future viruses", or even all the existing ones for that matter.
However, there -is- a generic disinfector, which can remove all
possible viruses, if it is applied before the infection takes place.
It is shiped with every DOS disk. It is called BACKUP. :-)

Ken, I got the impression that this is a FAQ too...

[Moderator's note: Added to the FAQ file, thanks!]

CPAV does not encrypt the scan strings is uses. Therefore, and program
that scans for scan strings and uses the same scan strings as CPAV,
will flag it as infected.

In general: Every virus scanning program -MUST- encrypt the scan
strings it uses. Furthermore, good anti-virus programs (like F-Prot)
do not rely on just finding a signature somewhere in the file, but
also require it to be at a specific place, otherwise they refuse to
try to remove the virus. The even better anti-virus programs (like Dr.
Solomon's Anti-Virus ToolKit) even perform a checksum on the
non-variable parts of the virus, and refuse to remove the virus, if it
is not identified exactly.

Right, according to the text in the $TOC file, the original has been
created with PKZIP 1.01 (Ross, aren't you going to update your
archiver?). Probably someone re-packaged it with PKZIP 1.10, since
version 1.01 is buggy and sometimes causes CRC errors to appear in the

Subject: A quick Michelangelo question (PC)

From information I've read about the Michelangelo virus, it seems that
the virus can be spread from an infected floppy diskette to a hard
drive only by attempting to boot from the floppy. A recent article in
a local newspaper sta ted that the virus can be spread from a floppy
diskette to a hard drive simply by doing a DOS dir of the floppy disk.
I think this is an incorrect statement.
  Can someone substantiate it for me?

Thanks again for all the help.

In fact, there is one reason that even a good checksumming program
needs a pretty up-to-date scanner. How else are you going to make sure
that the system you are installing the checksums on is virus-free?
(OK, I know that you know that; it was aimed mainly at the other
readers.)

I got this impression the last time I dicussed this with you. I'll
send you a more specific question about the security in private mail.

No. It was based on the fact that (sometimes in the past) I asked you
whether it is able to detect a particular kind of attack. As far as I
recall, you answered that you have not been aware of the possibility
of this attack. My apologies if it wasn't you :-) or if you have fixed
the problem.

I never objected speed. I objected security.

> It apparently detects more known viruses with its scanner component

Yeah, I clearly mentioned that the Untouchable's scanner has a
miserable detection rate. Something around 50 %. And nowdays anything
that has a detection rate below 90 % is considered not worth to use.

The latest thing I have seen is definitively older. 1.02b or something
like that. Hope the security problem has been already fixed. Otherwise
I agree that your integrity checker is one of the best available - as
Frisk's F-Prot is one of the best scanner/removers...

Subject: Device Drivers, Enough with the AUX awreddy (PC)

[Moderator's note: This is a re-posting of Padgett's earlier posting.]

>From:    KARGRA@GBA930.ZAMG.AC.AT
>Subject: auxfiles (PC)

Ok folks, this has gone far enough to be confusing so lets sort it out
once and for all. MS-DOS provides the capability for device drivers to
intercept character based transfers to themselves as if they were
files. One of the effects of this is the ability to "pipe" the output
from various sources. For example "dir >dir.lst" will redirect the
output from a directory listing to a file called "dir.lst". In the
same way "dir >prn" will redirect the output to the printer. Most can
also be used bi-directionally as the classic "copy con autoexec.bat"
demonstrates.

In DOS there are many such character devices that can look to DOS like
files: CON, PRN, AUX, CLOCK$, LPT1, LPT2, NUL, COM1 et al (installed
as part of IO.SYS). Memory managers often are installed in the same
way e.g.  SMARTAAR & EMMXXXX0. Additionally, at least one anti-viral
product (Enigma-Logic's Virus-Safe - also one of the few that can be
installed from CONFIG.SYS) uses this to return validation that it is
installed ("type swvsvers" will return the logo if installed, fail if
not).

The "DIR" command supplied with DOS is smart enough to be able to
separate a real file from a device driver but many other programs are
not - note that the intercept only occurs if the explicit name is used
- - CON or CLOCK$ will work, C* will not. This happens because the
device driver is doing the interception, not DOS, and it only reacts
to an explicit name, not wild cards.

Consequently, those programs that follow DOS rules or use the DOS
"dir" mechanism (DDIR - Double Dir is one) will not pick up device
drivers.  Those that do not (e.g. SDIR - Sorted Dir) will display the
driver.  Evidently, Norton's FF is one of this, as will probably be
any program which does not look for attribute bits.

Since these programs simply use DOS rules to change directory and then
look for the file, AUX, CON, or NUL for that matter will be found in
every directory and will probably report the current time and date.

Hopefully, this will answer the question.

					Warmly,

						Padgett

I had similar problems last week trying to run F-Prot 2.02D on an
old Zenith MS-DOS computer.  I think it, too, was running DOS 2.11.

I first tried unsuccessfully to boot from a diskette with DOS 5.0
on it.  I formatted a diskette (/S) using the DOS on the hard disk,
went to another machine, tested for infection and found none (two
other PCs in that office had been infected with Stoned), then
transferred F-Prot to the just-formatted diskette.  It booted OK,
but when I attempted to run F-Prot, I got the same message as above,
"*.TX0 not found".

I have not had a chance yet to try an intermediate version of DOS.

Subject: Joshi information, please (PC)

Greetings!

I've just been infected by my first virus, it turns out to be Joshi.
It seems to only infect 3.5" diskettes, I used F-prot 2.02 and the
newest version of Scanv86 to detect it.  F-prot described Joshi as the
SBC virus, anyone know what that is?  My question to everyone is what
does Joshi do?  I would even appreciate an FTP site which contains
virus documention.  My second question is how do I remove this virus?
F-prot said it could not remove the virus, but I did rename the file.
I cannot use my cleanv85 because the floppy turned out to be an
infected.  Help please!

General Description:

Menu or command line driven resident and non-resident scanner and change
detection software.  Operation restricting features remain untested.

                  Comparison of features and specifications



User Friendliness

Installation

The program is shipped on one write protected 5 1/4" disk.  The program
can be run off the disk, or installed on the hard disk through an
installation program.

Ease of use

The menu interface is generally straightforward and simple.  There are
some exceptions; in particular the list of viri that can be dealt with.
The screen format, and cursor movement keys, of the list and the
resulting information do not match.  However, it is helpful to have this
feature onscreen.

Help systems

Limited.

Compatibility

Additional virus signatures can be added in an external text file.  The
format for the signatures is given in the READ.ME text on disk, and is
not difficult to figure out.  However, the format is not compatible with
the fairly widely used IBM VIRSCAN format.  Also, a maximum of 64
signatures can be added in this way.

Program testing on machines fitting the hardware requirements
occasionally failed.

Company Stability

Unknown.

Company Support

Unknown.  The package, as received from the manufacturer, was somewhat
mislabelled as to the contents and version of the program.

Documentation

The documentation is quite brief.  The first page basically states that
the program can be run without reading the documentation, and the
remainder, while clear, is quite terse and seems to be designed for the
more advanced user.  Much of the documentation is a description of how
the menuing system and command line switches work.  No specifics are
given as to how functions (such as "revealing the presence of" unknown
viral programs in memory) are accomplished.

A very helpful feature is a "latest information" button on the menu
interface which presents the disk READ.ME file.  Thus the latest program
info, helpful hints and the hardcopy errata can be browsed onscreen.

Hardware Requirements

At least two disk drives, one of which must be a floppy, 512K memory and
DOS 3.0 or higher.

Performance

It is gratifying to note the importance that EliaShim gives to boot
sector viri.  The package contains provisions to save and restore the
boot sector and partition records for the hard disk.

Testing of this program was very problematic.  The program would not run
properly on the primary testing machine (a NEC Multispeed).  The system
locked up, repeatedly on most attempts to invoke any of the programs in
the package, including the installation and menuing program.

Testing of the programs is not as complete as I would prefer.  However,
it can be said that the claims made for this package exceed performance.
The package is able to detect known viral programs, and can deal with
most effectively.  Performance with viral programs not known to the
authors/program indicates that these viri are able to bypass
protections.

Local Support

Not provided.

Support Requirements

Users at any level should be able to run the program without assistance.

                                 General Notes

The package has a multilayered approach to virus detection and
prevention.  It should be suitable for most users in situations of
normal risk.  While the package would effectively deal with the bulk of
infections one would normally encounter, some of its claims would appear
to be overrated.  Nevertheless, its use would significantly reduce risk
of infection.
