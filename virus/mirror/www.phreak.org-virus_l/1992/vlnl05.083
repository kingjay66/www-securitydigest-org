When you ask McAfee CLEAN to remove a boot sector virus it simply
puts back the hidden sector, but does not check if it is clean.
When I was a lecturer it was not uncommon to find two BS viruses
on the same disk.  CLEAN will merely replace the first virus with
the 2nd, so you must run SCAN 3 times & CLEAN twice to make sure
such a disk is really clean.

Occasionally we would find Stoned/Brain/Stoned.  If you run CLEAN
repeatedly on such a disk you will get the two viruses
alternately for ever, but no warning that the disk is still
infected.  IF you use CLEAN to remove a BS virus ALWAYS run SCAN
again to make sure the disk is really clean.

So the original disk may well have been infected with both
viruses.  I have confirmed this is still true for CLEAN 8.3V86.
I can supply test disks if anyone wants to verify this.

I assumed in the above that "disk" meant "floppy", but notice a
reference to MBR on re-reading.  I think the above still applies
(I am none too enthusiastic about putting two BS viruses on any
of our hard disks, and many combinations are fatal), but CLEAN
has a 2nd serious bug in fixing MBRs.  In Australia dealers often
booted PCs from infected master disks before partitioning the
hard disk.  CLEAN puts back the whole of the hidden MBR, including
the now incorrect partition information. This has also been
confirmed for CLEAN 8.3V86

Thanks for the suggestion, but every time we try any trick like this
we can guarantee a flood of support calls from users with obscure
versions of BIOS, DOS, disk managers, hardware, etc, etc.

eg  You can retrieve the path & program name from the environment
    under DOS 3 or above, right?  (Duncan; Advanced MSDOS, says
    so, while Hogan; The Programmers PC SourceBook, asserts this
    applies to DOS 2 up.)

    Not on some Epsons running DOS 3.1 to my certain knowledge.

With things like Stacker, etc, around we will be very wary of doing
any more delving in the hardware.  If a virus crashes on 30 (or even
50)% of PCs it will still propagate happily, but if our program
crashes on one PC in 1000 we will get complaints about it.

Peter Norton visited Australia in early 1990 (Jan or Feb if my memory
is correct), and gave a public talk at Melbourne University.  I asked
him if his firm was planning to do anything about viruses.  He
launched into a tirade about urban myths, starting with the story
about crocodiles in the NY sewers, and going on to a story going
around in his youth about a girl with a beehive hairdo.  A spider
built its' nest in it, then bit her & she died.

From the vehemence and length of his answer I am sure he had given it
many times before.

Peter Stuckey didn't write anything.  He merely acted as postman for

but the relevant authorities seem to be hiding from us at the moment.)

I won't answer Vesselins comments in detail, except to re-iterate
my statement;

   "IF you replace any boot sector VET does not recognise on any
    new disk, or any disk that has been in anyone elses PC, you
    CANNOT get a pure boot sector virus."

I did not explain that our documentation says that if you get any
valuable software from anyone else the first thing you should do
is to check if the disks are write protected, and if not write
protect them. Then check them, & if VET does not like the boot
sector (or finds a virus) copy the files to a clean disk & check
(& disinfect) that.  This way you won't destroy anything valuable,
& if a disk is infected you still have the evidence, & can't be
accused of infecting it yourself.

A lot of viruses arrive on shrink wrapped disks, etc, but a lot
more (especially the ubiquitous BS ones) are caught from
"harmless" data disks, usually by people who "never boot from
floppies".

Many of us are so busy thinking of obscure holes in each others
products that we overlook the fact that 99% of viral incidents
involve a few well known & readily detectable & removable
viruses.  It is nice thinking of ways of preventing exotic
attacks, but meanwhile our PCs are being overrun with Stoned, M,
& similar trivia.

I fully agree that no system is foolproof, and we never claim so
in our advertisements, but keeping viruses out is very largely
good housekeeping, and almost any scanner will detect the vast
majority of actual virus attacks. Furthermore a scanner is the
only form of defence that will detect viruses before they have
any chance do anything to your system.

Assuredly someone has to be hit by a new virus before the
scanners can find it, but refusing to use a scanner because it is
not 100% secure is like refusing to use a condom because they
sometimes have holes in them, or may burst.

Integrity checkers provide a valuable second line of defence, but
they are not entirely reliable unless the user can be persuaded
to boot from a clean DOS disk, and experience has shown that they
do not work well in the hands of unskilled users.

Relying entirely on an integrity checker is akin to relying on
blood checks to protect yourself against AIDs.  Granted they will
usually detect viruses before they do any damage, but are you
prepared to stake your life on it?

There is one reason - (but I'm not saying it's a good reason)

We have several "stealth" viruses that work on a file basis - that is,
when an anti-virus program opens a file for scanning the virus may
intercept the operation, and either disinfect the file (and infect it
again when it is closed) or mess with the read operations, so that the
file appears "clean".

One way to bypass these viruses is to access the file system on a lower
level - that is, read the root directory directly with INT 13 or INT 26
calls, and "walk the FAT" - bypassing the DOS file system entirely.

Now, using INT 26 should not cause problems with stacker, as it operates on
a cluster by cluster basis - but INT 13 calls would just return garbage.

So, if anybody produced a virus scanner, which scanned the disk with
INT 13 calls - or simply JMPing directly into ROM, we could expect
horrible compatibility problems with Stacker and similar programs.

Well, at least the documentation in version 0.91-beta states that the
source is not available.

However....

At least two people that I know of have been contacted by "Dark
Avenger" and offered the source code for $5000 - to be paid to Todor
Todorov, I think, who would then forward the money to DA.

If the source is indeed available, I guess somebody must have bought
it...  :-(

Anyhow - my program now detects all three MtE viruses, and *should*
(no promises, though) be able to detect new MtE viruses .

Oh no...

   consider: people may simply have left their (infected) computer
             turned off all day March 6th.

   or:       somebody got infected, removed the virus but did not
             disinfect all floppies - the chances of becoming re-infected
             are fairly high.

However, in my opinion the real danger is elsewhere - some companies
distributed Michelangelo-specific detection programs free of charge -
many people may have received them, found that they did not have
Michelangleo and belive their machines are "clean"....but in reality
they may be infected with "Stoned" or any other (common) virus.

Well, it is related - in version 2.03 I now identify the three members
of the family as Denzuko (NOT Den Zuk), Ohio (alias Hacker) and
(Mardi Bros).

The reason for the mis-identification was that the Mardi Bros signatures

The reason for this is that the programs use OPTLINK, (a linker which

heuristics did not include a rule to specifically exclude OPTLINK
(I have rules to exclude PKLITE, LZEXE, DIET, KVETCH, ICE, EXEPACK etc)

This (at least WORD.COM) is a documented false positive - see ANALYSE.DOC.
I am working on reducing the number of false positives, but I fully agree
that heuristic analysis should only be used by experienced users....there
are still some false positives....

This is theoretically impossible - just ask Fred Cohen :-)

[Well, it is easy to see if it is a true DOS boot sector, but there will
always be some "unknowns"...]

However, it is *nearly* possible in practice, although you will always
get a few false positives, a few false negatives or both.

I am working on my heuristic analysis - which (and I think nobody in
the anti-virus community disagrees with me) is able to detect the
majority of unknown viruses, but it is not perfect - I don't analyse
boot sectors yet, and I detect only a low percentage of viruses
written in high-level languages.  However, as I said...the analysis is
improving.

Vesselin is right - it is the actual scanner.  What happens is - I have
a set of signatures for Stoned.  If I find at least two, I assume a
boot sector is infected and proceed to identify the variant) but if I find
only one I suggest it may be a new variant.

Now, as my program knows that "Stoned" is a BSV, and should not be found
in a com file it displays the message

    XXXXX.XXX seems to be a Stoned-dropper

if it finds 2 (or more) Stoned-signatures in the file.  If, however, the
scanner only finds one signature, it will display the message

    XXXXX.XXX  possibly a dropper program for a new variant of Stoned.

So, in this case the problem is caused by a bad (too short) signature
string for Stoned.  I changed the Stoned signatures in 2.03, so the
problem may have gone away - but I cannot test it - I can't find
2to1 or safembr anywhere...

As I keep telling you :-) there is a good reason why I don't do that -
I like my "sufficiently exact" variant identification, because it allows
me to disinfect a virus even if it has been modified by changing a single
byte - if I used exact identification, I would determine it was a new
variant and had to give up on disinfecting it...On the other hand, if the
virus is modified more - source code modified & reassembled in particular,
I will detect that as a new variant and refuse to disinfect, avoiding
any damage to the files.

Some disagree with my strong emphasis on disinfection - but my experience
is that it is necessary - most users don't keep proper backups... :-)
That's why I can disinfect a higher percentage of viruses correctly than
any other anti-virus producer....at least according to Swoboda's recent
test of disinfection of 24.000 infected files. [If the moderator thinks
it it accecptable I can post his results here...]

Uh, how could you get polymorphism without self-encryption - moving

encryption...

Of course, one program that is (usually) effective against polymorphic

   there are a few viruses that I don't detect - either very new ones
   that Alan has, but I don't or "garbage" viruses that don't work...
   For example, the AVTK detects the Starship virus, but as far as I know
   nobody in the West has been able to make it replicate, so I have
   simply not bothered to detect it.

   Also, If you consider my heuristic analysis (yes, yes, Vesselin, I

"OMICRON" is (perhaps among other things!) another name for the
viruses that we call "FLIP".  There are two that are reasonably common
in the world: the 2153 and 2343 strains.  They infect both files and
master boot records of hard disks.  The most reliable removal is to
erase and replace the infected files, and use some MBR-fixing utility
(see previous traffic in this list about the /MBR option of FDISK) to
fix the hard disk master boot records.  Or you could get some other
anti-virus package that can do it automagically, although that's not
as reliable.  (Or he could call CP and ask them if they have an update
to CPAV that will do it.)

The 2343 strain (the rarer of the two) also patches COMMAND.COM, so
your friend might want to replace that, too, just in case (it doesn't
make it viral, it just makes it lie about some file lengths and/or not
work at all).

Nope!  Not unless someone is using "OMICRON" to refer to some other

Subject: Re: MDISK & FDISK - Are they the same? (PC)

Hello David Swayze,

The FDISK program is MS-DOS's utility to partition a hard disk after
low-level formatting or change the sizes of the partiions, etc.
M-DISK is a set of utility programs for replacing the Master Boot
Record (partition table) and DOS Boot Sector code when infected by a
virus.  M-DISK works for MS-DOS (and PC-DOS) 3.00 through 4.01.
MS-DOS 5.00 has it's own built-in "M-DISK" for removing partition
table infectors.  It's the undocumented /MBR switch, which will remove
the existing code in the MBR and replace it with a clean copy from
inside itself, while leaving the data (the actual partition table)
intact.

Subject: Post March 6 Michelangelo Infections (PC)

      YAMP (yet another Michelangelo posting).....

      Re: the discussion of the probability of more Michelangelo infections,
my lab got its first (at least, first known to me) post-March 6 Michelangelo
infection today, April 2, 1992.
      A student put her floppy disk in the A: drive, and THEN obeyed our
signs posted on each PC to "RESET BEFORE USING."  Frisk's Virstop caught it
and prevented the PC from completing the boot, so there was no harm done.
We successfully removed it from the floppy and hard disk using F-prot 202d.

      Now, this is the real reason for posting.  Before cleaning the student's
diskette, I used Diskcopy to copy the virus to another diskette, so I could
look at it (I know, curiosity felled the feline.....).  Took it home, booted
my pc, put the infected diskette in the A: drive (my b: drive is wrong size
for this disk), did a Dir, deleted the student's assignment files, then ran
F-Prot on the A drive.  I had previously confirmed the infection at school
with F-prot.  F-prot said "The Stoned virus search pattern has been found
in memory..."
      My "understanding" was that Mich. would only do anything at boot time.
I reset the PC from the hard disk using ctrl-alt-del, and re-ran F-prot. No
infection on disk or in memory, so I assume whatever was in memory that
triggered f-prot did not infect my hard disk.
      Is this something as simple as Dir copying the boot sector and FAT into
memory and F-prot finding it there, or is there a risk of infection from
(this version of) Michelangelo even after booting?  I also re-booted from
my sanitized and hermetically sealed Dos boot disk and re-scanned the disk. It
was still clean.

      Thanks,   Scot Carpenter

Subject: some research subjects, info wanted

Hello,

As from this week I am doing research into the following issues:
- - how to determine from a virus program which soft- and hardware the author has
  used for developing the virus (well at least how to make a good guess)
- - whether or not it is possible to prove that a certain virus is the result of
  a certain previous version (with previous version I mean an _unfinished_
  virus program)
- - if there is much room for improvement in the "heuristical" search method, and
  if it will eventually become the standard method for virus detection

I would very much appreciate a response concerning:
- - how far current research into these issues has developed
- - suggestions where to look for more information, apart from this list

Thanks in advance,

Subject: New Anti-viral Product Announcement

        New Anti-viral Package Featuring Real Intelligence,
                         not Artificial

      with exceptional capability to handle "stealth" viruses as well
              as others that target PCs running MS/PC-DOS

   Description: VDS (Virus Detection System) 2.0 is an anti-viral
software package designed to contain the spread of computer viruses by
providing early detection and quick recovery. What distinguishes VDS
from other anti-viral products is that its operation is based on
analyzing viral behavior rather than just looking for known byte
sequences extracted from virus samples. Therefore, VDS does not
require frequent upgrades.
   VDS uses a proprietary triple-pass verification technique to catch
the most evasive "stealth" viruses even when they are active in
memory. Coupled with its blazing operational speed (thanks to its
optimized internal cache), VDS represents the strongest software
solution currently available.
   VDS generates a customized device driver during installation. The
device driver barely adds three seconds to bootup time and catches all
system infectors with ease. It can recover vital system areas such as
the master boot record and the partition boot record automatically,
and place a copy of the affected area in a file so that the user can
examine it later. The user is given an opportunity to embed his own
message inside the device driver. This message is displayed if a
possible infection is detected.  Businesses will find this feature
very useful since it can be used to prompt users to report any
incidents as instructed by the message. The device driver can also be
configured to freeze the computer after displaying the customized
message to ensure that it is not ignored.
   A unique feature of VDS is its decoy launching mechanism.
The decoys are used to lure any viruses active in memory and to
capture them in a POV (Prisoner Of VDS) file for examination.  The
captured intruders can speed up diagnosis process since you will know
which virus you are dealing with or whether it is a new virus.
   VDS documentation rivals many books on computer viruses not
only by its readability but also by its technical content. It offers
practical guidelines and a risk analysis test designed to evaluate the
vulnerability of your computers to viral attacks.
   The package includes a special utility program that helps users to
recover from all system infectors that target vital areas of hard
drives such as the master boot record. Another program in the package
allows users to search DOS-compatible (including network) drives for
known viruses.  This program sports an easy-to-use menu-driven user
interface as well as a spartan command-line mode for individuals who
do not mind remembering half a dozen options. It also has a mechanism
to add new virus patterns externally.
   Availability: VDS Advanced Research Group offers different
versions of VDS: trial, personal, academic, charity, business and
complimentary. Trial version is only $7 and can be ordered directly
from the developers. It is also available on several BBSes and can be
downloaded for free. Personal version sells for $25 (plus shipping)
and can be used on as many computers as the user personally owns.  If
the user chooses to become a registered user after ordering the trial
version, the $7 is credited towards the payment for the personal
version. Site licenses for businesses can be negotiated.  Business
version allows all employees of a company to use VDS on their home
computers at no extra charge.  What's more, site licenses need NOT be
renewed periodically!
   System Requirements: IBM PC/XT/AT/PS2 or compatible computer with
256K RAM, MS/PC-DOS 3.0 or higher, a hard drive and a floppy diskette
drive.
   How to Order: Phone orders can be placed by calling (410) 247-7117
and providing your name, address and the diskette size (of A: drive)
you need. You must pay by C.O.D. or request to make another
arrangement if your company policy does not permit C.O.D. purchases.
To order VDS by mail or if you have any questions, you can write to:

************************ Posting Follows *************************
     A new "IBM Anti-Virus" services offering for PC's and Personal
Systems is available.  It is currently available in the U.S. only,
although it may be marketed to U.S. multinational firms.  It is
currently available by special bid and is planned for announcement as a
regular services offering in the future.

     Basically, the offering makes available to customers the software
and techniques that IBM has been using internally to combat viruses for
the past several years.

     The service consists of:

     o  Access to all of the anti-virus software used by IBM (VIRSCAN,
        VSTOP, Verifiers, Disinfectors, CHECKUP) plus any new software
        developed on any platform during the contract period.

     o  Access to the Anti-Virus Bulletin Board where the latest versions
        of the tools are available, virus alert information, access to
        IBM Virus Expert Assistance.  The Bulletin Board is available
        via an 800 number   and is available 24 hours/day.  It is
        monitored during prime shift and the board has the capability to
        alert the virus personnel via a pager of a virus incident
        24 hours/day.

     o  Personnel to provide advice and consulting in cleanup of a virus
        incident.

     o  Capability to reverse engineer any new viruses to add signatures
        to our tools.  This service, performed in conjunction with the
        Watson Research Lab in Hawthorne, usually can respond within
        48-72 hours.

     The service is priced on the number of PC's/PS2's protected by the
service.

     The service is just starting and has a great deal of interest from
the customer accounts.  It is marketed by the Branch Marketing Reps and
revenue flows to the Trading Areas, while the service is performed by my
group.  The biggest problem we have had is explaining the service to the
branches.  We are NOT marketing software such as Dr. Soloman and Norton,
but are offering a service to our customers which include tools
necessary to perform the service.  The software remains the property of
IBM and the customer has a license to use the code.  Our advantage is
our ability to respond quickly, assist the customer in cleanup of a
virus incident, and the access of new tools (potentially on other
platforms if a virus is discovered, i.e. AS/400).

     U.S. customers who want to learn more about IBM Anti-Virus Services
can call 800-742-2493.

Subject: FP-203.ZIP - Virus detection/removal/prevention/information

I just uploaded version 2.03 of my F-PROT anti-virus package to SIMTEL20.

[Moderator's note: See follow-up 2.03A posting below!]

pd1:<msdos.trojan-pro>
FP-203.ZIP      Virus detection/removal/prevention/information

Version 2.03 - major changes:

  The program can now scan inside PKLITE (1.03, 1.1 and 1.13), LZEXE, EXEPACK
  and ICE-packed files.

  A list of all viruses that are found is now displayed while the program
  is running in interactive mode, instead of just being displayed
  afterwards.

Version 2.03 - corrections:

  If F-PROT 2.02 was run with just the /HELP option, it might leave the
  cursor turned off on certain types of display adapters - fixed.

  User-specified file extensions were saved correctly to the setup file,
  but not restored the next time the program was run - fixed.

  The rewrite of the virus scanner engine in version 2.02 resulted in some
  false positives, and the search patterns have now been changed as
  necessary.  The following false positives were reported and corrected:

      "Possibly a new variant of Sylvia" in TUTOR.COM (Word Perfect 4.2)
      "Shirley" (Quick Scan), in DIET 1.10A overlay-mode compressed files.
      "SBC" in several small EXE files.
      "Yaunch" (Quick Scan) in several programs.
      "AIDS" in a few programs from Personal Bibliographic Software

  The program also no longer reports certain files from Central Point
  Software as Flip-infected - it seems the programmers there used the same
  signature string as F-PROT uses, but they did not encrypt it.

  The command BREAK=ON could sometimes cause F-PROT to crash - fixed.

  F-PROT might not return the correct return code (ERRORLEVEL), when it
  found a boot sector virus, unless the virus was active in memory.

  Quick Scan would leave the name of the last file scanned on the screen,
  even if it was not infected - fixed.

  2.02 produced an ugly error message if it attempted to scan a .SYS file
  under Netware, which was in use by another program - now it simply says
  "Error opening ......"

  When operating in command line mode on old IBM XT's with monochrome or
  CGA adapters, the program sometimes produced unexpected characters on
  the screen - fixed.

Version 2.03 - minor improvements:

  The /TROJAN command-line switch is now default, instead of /NOTROJAN.

  Primary names are now highlighted in the virus list.

  The following command-line switches have been added:

      /PACKED  (default) scan inside packed files.
      /NOPACKED          don't scan packed files.
      /NOSUB             don't scan subdirectories.

  The set of default extensions now includes OV? instead of OVR and OVL.

  Long lines (>80 chars) in the scan report now wrap properly.

  The heuristic analysis did not identify files that had been compressed
  with OPTLINK, but instead reported them as moving around in memory in a
  suspicious way.

  If the /REPORT command-line switch is used, and the report file already
  exists, the new report will be appended to the previous one.

  The F-TEST.COM program is now included again - see VIRSTOP.DOC for
  details.

Version 2.03 - new viruses:

  The following 81 new viruses can now be detected and removed.

  The following 6 "viruses" are now detected/identified.  They don't
  work at all, due to serious internal errors, but the reason I bother to
  detect them is because they are included in some "virus collections",

  detect them already.

The only change between 2.03 and 2.03A is a fix for a very minor bug -
the heuristic analysis module in F-PROT.EXE thought (incorrectly) that
VIRSTOP.EXE was using some suspicious techniques.
