Subject: New Virus? (PC)

I have recently encountered a virus wich seems to only infect .com
files and add 322 bytes to infected files. I have not (as of yet) had
a chance to s study this "new" virus. Infected .com files contain the
text "The Troi Virus". This virus escapres detection from both scan85
(I do not have the newest version) and F-prot202d. While running the
heuristics scan from f-prot I get the warning that "it is most likely
virus infected" on a purposefully infected file. I have "watched" this
virus attempt any new .com file being executed to be infected once it
is memory resident.  I have sent a copy to one expert allready -- I
have no idea of the others locations to send virii to.

Actually, this is extremely common behaviour in MS-DOS machines in
general.  I have often had machines that would suddenly behave as if
all the keys were "shift"ed, "ctrl"ed or "alt"ed.  Some could be
recovered, and some couldn't (at least I never found a way to do it.)
None were virally infected.

A trojan horse that pretends to be the latest version of McAfee's SCAN
program has been seen locally.  So far all versions have had -AV
codes, although none have been reported with the McAfee license number
(NWN405).

The "parent" file is titled "CLEANV87.ZIP", and contains most of the
files from the normal SCAN package, including file called SCAN.EXE.
(SCAN.EXE is normally distributed in an archive named SCANVxx.ZIP,
while the associated CLEANUP program is generally shipped in an
archive named CLEANxx.ZIP.)  The SCAN.EXE file is slightly shorter,
65,765 bytes, than SCAN version 86B.  The SCAN87.DOC file contains
validation codes which match those for the trojan.

The program initially runs similarly to the normal SCAN program,
identifying itself as SCAN8.5A87.  It finds no viri in memory or on
disk, and then says it will write REPORT.SCN.  At this point, if the
system does not have a hard disk, the program crashes with "Runtime
error 105 at 0000:2725".  If the system does have a hard disk, the
program will display a message about the Illuminati and will then
erase, and "zero out", all files on the disk.  Directory structure is
left intact.

There is one report that the REPORT.SCN file contains a message to the
sysop of the Gallows Howe BBS, referring to the BBS number in the West
Point Grey area of Vancouver, with reference to a voice number in
Richmond.

Running multiple configurations of memory management and
network/non-network set ups, I've had any number of occasions where
something was left hanging in memory which wasn't cleared up by a warm
boot - either c-a-d or one of the software types.

News item in The Washington Post, Sat. Feb. 29, 1992, Page B1.

"The Michelangelo computer virus has infected roughly 80 percent of
the 3,000 personal computers at the New Jersey Institute of
Technology.  Computer specialists at the Newark Campus have launched
an emergency effort to test each machine and remove the virus before
it can activate and destroy stored data on March 6, the Italian

	A little caution with this is in order however.  Someone told
me about attemting to wipe a disk with a magnet.  The final results
was a 3.5" disk whose metal cover could lift a pen.  While it would
undoubtably erradicate any evil code on the disk, it would also do
wonders to the drive head of the system in question...

Subject: What does the Tequilla virus do? (PC)

We found several PC's that were infected with the Tequilla virus [Teq]
using McAfree's scan 86b program.  We were able to use clean to remove
the viruses from the infected hard disks, although it destroyed the
boot sector and we needed to restore it with Norton's Disk Doctor.

Does anyone have any experiences or comments about the Tequilla virus?
Does it have a trigger date?  How does it spread?  Are there any
machines or operating systems that are "immune"?  How long has the
virus been around?  Is it a particular problem in Belgium or has it
been more prevalent here?  Any information would be appreciated.

I guess the publicity over the Michelangelo virus is helping us to
ferret out the other ones.

Thanks in advance.

Yes, write protection will absolutely protect you.

Note, however, that this must be H A R D W A R E write protection such
as provided by floppy disk tabs. Few off_the_shelf winchester hard
disks offer this option, although it used to be standard on HDU's on
minis. The RK-05 and RL-02 come to mind.

It's no big deal to add a HW write protect switch to a MFM/RLL drive. I
have not looked at doing this to an IDE or a SCSI, though.

(Trouble with F-PROT finding ENGLISH.TX0)

I might have missed the response from Frisk on this.  I suspect a
similar problem may arise when F-PROT is run from certain menu
packages.

When a program is executed, DOS 3 and up passes a message telling the
program it's name and path.  It seems F-PROT uses this feature for
locating its own directory, at least on my machine running DOS 3.30.
The absence of this message under DOS 2.xx may be tripping up F-PROT.
Menu systems have been known to fail to pass this message, too, even
under DOS 3 or higher.  In case of similar ("Can't find .TX0...")
trouble with F-PROT.EXE being run from a menu under DOS 3 or higher, a
workaround is to instead run COMMAND.COM with command line parameter
"/c path\F-PROT".  A workaround for DOS 2.xx is possible, too.

Is there not a danger that, once there exists a "standard" way in
which such infectors are detected, a virus could reach into the boot
code and disable this checking at the time that it infects?

Apparently they have confused Michelangelo with Joshi to some extent.
Maybe it was the word "Birthday" that managed to stick in their
memory?

When Joshi triggers (on January 5th) you must type "Happy Birthday
Joshi" in order to continue. Michelangelo does not ask for any input:
When it triggers, it just starts writing over the first 256 tracks on
the first four sides of the boot disk(ette). Bye-bye data!

A simple hardware level device driver for the normal AT type
controller is only several screen fulls of C code.  I would venture
that it would not be theoretically impossible to have such a thing in
a virus.  But, I think it is impossible to deactivate the disk
activity light.  So, in the above test method, I would keep a sharp
eye on the disk activity light, just in case.

If it's that important to have a good anti-virus tool (which it is)
then it should be mandatory on all PCs.  It's now come to the stage we
spend too much time chasing viruses and ant-viruse cures.  PCs are
supposed to be useful, productive and cost effective means of
computing.  I feel it's come to the stage that MSDOS should have
anti-virus tools as standard with the provision for updates through
normal computer stores or electronic means.  In other words, why
should we put up with so many different forms of anti-virus tools when
one should be enough and made a permanent feature of all PCs.  That
way the spread of viruses would be much harder since every system
would stop the spread as close to the source as possible.  Then we can
get back to using PCs for other more productive uses.  Otherwise, we
will quickly come to the stage of having so many new viruses (one per
day or worse) that we spend most of our time doing
backups/restores/virus-checking/etc.  If it's not that important to
make every system safe then the opposite argument becomes true, namely
we are all becoming paranoid about viruses (which I don't think is
true).  You see, you can't have it both ways.  Either we take it
seriously or not.

The following files have been placed on risc.ua.edu for anonymous FTP:

stealth.zip
 This is an anti-virus protection utility that uses a 32-bit CRC to test
 the integrity of the running program and any supporting files.  It also
 performs a basic system check for any viruses that may evade detection by
 a file check.  Supporting code is in C and Turbo Pascal and full
 documentation is included.  (DOS)

Below is a file listing from risc.ua.edu (130.160.4.7) pub/ibm-antivirus files.
If you see an outdated file, please let me know which file so I can replace it.
Thanks.
