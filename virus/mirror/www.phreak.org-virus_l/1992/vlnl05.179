It doesn't infect anything in the B: drive. It also doesn't infect
3.5" 720 Kb diskettes (due to a bug), even if they are in drive A:. It
can infect 3.5" 1.44 Mb diskettes in drive A:, but the infection makes
them unreadable on some systems.

This is what the author thinks. In fact, he is wrong, there are no
more than 96 different techniques. Of course, if you count the two
versions of PC-MPC, this gives you 192 significantly different
viruses.

This probably means just three possible ways to install in memory. I
don't see what the high memory has to do with it.

Frisk does. F-Prot 2.06a calls the viruses generated by both versions
of PS-MPC "New or modified variant of PS-MPC", except one of the
viruses, which is called "PS-MPC (644)".

Dr. Solomon's Anti-Virus ToolKit calls all the viruses generated by
both versions of PS-MPC "like PS-MPC encoded".

SCAN 97 detects very few (4 of 195 infected files in our tests) of the
viruses and calls them "Zeppelin [Zpp]" or "644 [644]". Probably they
don't have this virus generator yet. I am sending both versions of it
to them. Hopefully, the future versions of SCAN will be able to detect
all PS-MPC generated viruses. After all, this is relatively easy -
PS-MPC is not MtE...

Subject: F-Prot Bug (PC)

I just got version 2.06a of F-Prot but I think it is still buggy.
When I check the Virus Information, the program quits whenever I
selected information on the second virus I pick, exactly the second
virus.  Otherwise the program works very well.

I hope this is something that is easily fixed.

Subject: Dangerous bug in CLEAN 97 (PC)

Hello, everybody!

Some time ago, somebody complained that CLEAN is damaging some
Michelangelo infected diskettes. I had reports about such thing since
long time, but when I first tried to reproduce the problem, I didn't
succeed. Now we did some more complete tests at the VTC-Hamburg and we
can confirm that yes, this is true, there is a bug in CLEAN 97 (and in
the older versions too), which makes it damage the 1.2 Mb diskettes,
infected with the Michelangelo virus. Here is what the bug consists
in.

Michelangelo is very similar to Stoned. In fact, it is a Stoned
variant. When the virus is in memory, SCAN 97 reports Stoned, not
Michelangelo. This is a bug too, but not that serious. SCAN 97
correctly identifies the virus on the boot sector as Michelangelo.

When CLEAN 97 is told to remove the virus [mich] from a diskette, it
reads the boot sector, makes sure that the virus is really present
there, then reads the original boot sector from Side 1, Cylinder 0,
Sector 3 and writes it onto Side 0, Cylinder 0, Sector 1. The
procedure for removing Stoned is exactly the same and it is quite
possible that one and the same routine is used in both cases.

However, Michelangelo is -not- Stoned! One of the differences is that
on 1.2 Mb diskettes it saves the original boot sector on Side 1,
Cylinder 0, Sector 14. Therefore, what CLEAN does results in
overwriting the boot sector of the 1.2 Mb diskettes with the third
sector of their root directory. Very often this sector contains
zeroes. On some systems, zeroing the diskette boot sector means that
the diskette becomes completely unreadable.

Therefore: Beware of CLEAN 97! Don't use it for disinfection of
Michelangelo from 1.2 Mb diskettes, or you risk to lose your data.

McAfee Associates has been notified of the bug and they are probably
already working on the solution. Hopefully, the bug will be fixed in
the next release of CLEAN.

Meanwhile, if you have some 1.2 Mb diskettes, infected with
Michelangelo (which is rather probable, because the virus is
relatively widespread), you have the following options:

1) Copy the files from the infected diskette to somewhere else (don't
use DISKCOPY, copy them as files), format the infected diskette, then
copy the files back.

2) Use the command

	clean a: [genb]

to remove the virus, not "clean a: [mich]". This works slowly, but
removes the virus correctly.

3) Use a different virus removal program.

Vesselin

Has anyone on this list heard of the CANSU virus?  Many of the

anyone know of other anti-virals that will detect and/or disinfect it?

Don't know about Windows, but Castle Wolfenstein 3D has locked up on
me on a number of occasions.  The DOS prompt appears on the graphics
screen, but as a number of dots spread widely yet still discernable,
like some mad pointillist artist had taken over.  The computer is
unusable since Wolf3D's interrupt handlers are apparently still in
place.  I say apparently because there's no response to my keystrokes,
and the music keeps playing on my Adlib.  This happens with both
versions 1.00 and 1.11 of the .EXE (look at the time on the file).
 
What do you mean by latest versions of the scanners?  The numbers
change so frequently that you must specify.  SCAN was 97 but is now
97-B, and F-Prot is 2.06a.  You might look for VirX 2.4 or TBscan
from the usual places, but it sounds to me like you're just being
bitten by bugs in Wolf and Windows.
 
Another thing to try would be Integrity Master 1.24 (i-m124.zip) to
see if any files are being modified.

Nobody doubts that SCAN is one of the best packages for telling you if you
have a virus at all (whether it, Alan's FINDVIRU or my own F-PROT does best
in testing, depends of course primarily on whose collecion is used).  The
point is, however, that SCAN is occasionally not very accurate in determining
exactly which virus you have.

The problem with this one is that you don't really know where to look for it.
It is not hard to detect by scanning the entire file, but that is really
time-consuming. It is a problem - and I think most scanners will have a hard
time detecting it.

No, it is NOT equivalent. The difference is that you have a right to expect
a 100% detection of normal samples of all viruses - MtE or otherwise.

However - it is not fair to expect 100% detection of all virus droppers.

Suppose I had a program X, which contained an encrypted copy of the virus Y.
When you run X, all it does is to decrypt Y and execute it.  Would you
insist that my scanner (and all other scanners) should detect this program
as a "Y-dropper" ?

If "yes" - then how on earth do you expect that to be possible for all
programs X, using all possible encryption method ?

If "no" - then why do you think I should detect the program originally
discussed, which is nothing more than an example of a program of this type ?

I would like to be able to detect all virus droppers, but you see, that is
simply not possible. It is also not very critical - virus droppers spread
much more slowly than the actual viruses.

Well, possibly - but it would be a bit difficult - in particular if
the file is bigger than available memory. If it is
multiply-compressed, I don't see how I could uncompress only the
relevant portions of it.  If you can see a way to do that, please let
me know :-)

Well.  I have such a list - most of it is in Ralf Brown's book - which is
not surprising, as I the list to him - however, I don't really recommend
this approach.

The problems are:

    some of the calls conflict with some other software (such as NetWare),
    so the result may be totally unexpected.

    you will miss a very large part of the viruses, because they use one of
    the following tricks:

        stay resident at a fixed address, and just check whatever is there.

        check if some fixed address contains a "magic number"

        compare the INT 21 entry point code to their own handler (meaning that
        you can load multiple copies of the virus if you load an INT21
        hooking TSR after the first one.

   I would rather recommend scanning for signatures in memory, but anyhow,
   here is my list.  Please note that many of the names it contains are
   obsolete - maintaining this list is not high on my list of priorities.

Subject: SCAN Ver 97 & Monkey Virus (PC).

I have recently found one of my many DOS PC's and an OS/2 PC plus
diskettes infected with the Monkey virus. The virus was identified
using SCAN ver 97 and displayed the virus code as being of type [Mon].
It could not be removed with CLEAN because CLEAN found the virus code
active in memory and suggested the PC should be booted from a clean
copy of DOS and run SCAN to check the extent of the infection. When I
did this, SCAN could not access the hard disk because DOS had not
loaded the block disk device driver as the partition table had been
seriously modified.

SCAN ver 91
Found Generic Boot Virus [GenB] in boot sector.

SCAN ver 97
 Found the Monkey [Mon] Virus in boot sector.
 Found the Generic Boot [Genb] Virus in boot sector.

Virus [Mon] did not appear in the VIRLIST.TXT file v97. Can anybody post
me some information on how this virus operates.

 Many Thanks

Hello Folks,

Just to report the availability of the new versions of the Mcafee
Associates programs.

Following is an excerpt of Aryeh Goretsky announce message:

	VERSION 97-B RELEASED

	Version 97-B of VIRUSCAN, NETSCAN, and WSCAN has been released and
	uploaded to simtel, garbo, and risc.  This release fixes a bug in the
	validation codes (/AG switch) processing.  Seems that the scanning
	engine would generate an exception error on PC's using QEMM or EMM386
	if the last file scanned ended in a .SYS extension.  Some sort of a
	weird compiler optimization bug, I'm told.  In any case, it's been
	fixed.

Thanks Aryeh!

Subject: Need some help disinfecting NOP virus (PC)

We are experiencing an outbreak of NOP viruses on our campus.  Does
anyone have any recent experience with disinfecting this virus from
floppies and hard drives?  How about any suggestions on doing this
easily to a large population of several hundred users?  Are McAfee's
SCAN, and M-disk the best utilities to do this?  Are there any others
which work better?

The variant we have "obtained" will not let you access a
write-protected diskette unless the virus is already on the diskette.
It will give a "General failure reading Drive A:" if the diskette is
uninfected and write-protected.  As soon as you drop the write protect
tab and unprotect the disk, the drive will access the disk, give an
A:, and load the virus.

We have a variety of IBM's and compatibles, running on MSDOS 4.0 and
5.0.

Subject: Latest IBM Anti-virus stuff (PC)

I've traditionally posted announcements of new levels of the informal
IBM Anti-Virus Product here periodically.  It's that time again, and
this time I have something rather new.  IBM AntiVirus/DOS and IBM
AntiVirus/2, described in the attachment, incorporate the same
scanning technology that's in the familiar IBM Virus Scanning Program
(VIRSCAN), but also include resident monitoring, virus verification
and removal, and some heuristic new-virus detection stuff, all wrapped
up in a menuy user interface (there's also a command-line version of
most of it for the menu-allergic, hehe).  For those of you who know
something about IBM's internal tools, and those offered to customers
of the Anti-Virus Service Offering, the new function includes the
functions of the VIRSCAN, VSTOP, VERV and CHECKUP programs (with much
nicer interfaces, and all integrated together).

Phone numbers and prices and all are in the attached.  I'm afraid
I'm not sure how people outside the U.S. can get a copy at the
moment.

WEAPONS AGAINST COMPUTER VIRUSES

     In late October 1992, IBM announced two new anti-virus products
developed at the Thomas J. Watson Research Center.  The products, IBM
AntiVirus/DOS, operating in both the PC-DOS and Windows* environments,
and IBM AntiVirus/2, operating in the OS/2** environment, provide a
fully integrated set of facilities to counter attacks by computer
viruses.  The products are designed to automatically monitor and protect
the system without manual intervention.  When manual operation is
desired a full featured Common User Access (CUA) graphical user
interface is available.

     The new protection package, called IBM AntiVirus, is the
culmination of five years' work at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research
Center here, incorporating the experience and expertise that IBM
researchers have established in handling computer-virus incidents around
the world.

     IBM AntiVirus is designed to operate in the background without user
action, providing constant protection against viruses.  Hard disks can
be checked for viruses automatically when the computer is booted or at
times the user selects.  It detects and eliminates all common viruses
and over a thousand uncommon ones.  It will even detect viruses that
have not yet been discovered.

     The product's advanced technology virtually eliminates the false
alarms that plague many other anti-virus products.  The highly reliable
virus-elimination actions will not damage programs while they are being
disinfected, as many other anti-virus products do.

     There are two versions of the IBM AntiVirus product:  IBM
AntiVirus/DOS that includes anti-virus programs for both DOS and Windows
systems, and IBM AntiVirus/2 that provides protection for IBM's OS/2
operating system.  Each is available for $29.95 by calling 800-551-3579.
Information on site licensing and a full range of IBM's anti-virus
services for enterprises is available by calling 800-742-2493.

     This software is available for licensing to major software
publishers, who may contact Steve White at 914-784-7368.

I have uploaded to WSMR-SIMTEL20.Army.Mil:

SCANV97B.ZIP    VIRUSCAN 97-B checks PC's for viruses
NETSC97B.ZIP    NETSCAN 97-B checks LAN's for viruses
WSCAN97B.ZIP    VIRUSCAN for Windows 97-B

WHAT'S NEW

Version 97-B of VIRUSCAN, NETSCAN, and WSCAN fix a bug in Version 97
that would cause the programs to crash when scanning files while EMM386
and QEMM (and presumably other memory managers) are present.  No new
viruses or options have been added in this release.
