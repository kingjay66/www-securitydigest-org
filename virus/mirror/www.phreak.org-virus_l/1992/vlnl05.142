Subject: new virus found (PC)

A new virus not detected by McAfee's Scan93 nor Virx version 2.3 was
found in Brazil. F-prot said it's a new variant of jerusalem.  This
virus is a file infector for both .com and .exe files, including
command.com. Infected files grow of 1870 bytes (.com) or a variable
lenght of 1870 to 1885 bytes (.exe). Command.com grows 77 bytes, the
virus seems to overwrite some portion of it.

It can be found using the following string: (hex)
 56 56 56 00 00 00 43 4f 4d 4d 41 4e 44 2e 43 4f 4d 00 2a 2e 43 4f 4d
but this string is not much secure, because the virus was not
disassembled yet.  Samples were sent to well known virus researchers.

Subject: Re: Need Advice on Evaluating and Ordering Antivirus Software (PC)

We evaluated anti-viral software for MS-DOS.

We used the criteria:
Cost
Distribution off campus (the data doesn't stay on campus).
Frequency and quality of updates (anti-viral programs require
                                  frequent update)
General concerns about the nature of the supplier.
Prophylaxis as well as identification/removal.
"Ease of Use"
Co-existance with dos, windows, networks, various apps.

We ended up liking McAfee's product and Fridrick Skuulassen's product.
Bought f-prot on the basis of ease of distribution off campus.
We think we gave up some technical support by making this decision.
We very much admire McAfee's company and can testify to the support
they have to offer.

This is a known problem with some BIOSes. There is a set of programs
Out There Somewhere (tm) which fix it. I came across them under the
name INT099FI.ZIP, so look for that name wherever you usually get your
shareware and PD software.

Yep! And the WALDO-error also pops up if you use Corel 2.0 + win 3.1 +

Subject: New "Vengeance" virus on Fidonet (PC)

In a message in the Fidonet VIRUS_INFO discussion area, a poster
identified as "Richard Head" from 1:105/609.0 included a virus he
identifies as "Vengeance".  It was sent as a "DEBUG script"; a set of
commands which will instruct the DEBUG program shipped with every copy
of MS-DOS to make a copy of the virus.  The fact that it was published
on Fidonet means that many "virus-writer-wannabes" around the world
will be able to make copies and release them locally.

The poster states that SCAN version 86 is unable to find it: F-PROT
2.04B identifies it as a Vienna variant, SCAN 95 identifies it as
"Parasite", TBscan 4.1 identifies it as suspect through the
"heuristic" analysis.  (HTScan 1.18 with VSIG9207 and VIRx 2.3 do
not identify it.)  Those who do not have these scanners can check
programs with a file viewer for the words "Vengeance" and
"SKISM/Phalcon" near the end of the file.

The poster claims that it is a "hardware damaging" virus, but the
"author's notes" accompanying it indicate that it will only "format"
the first 32 tracks of the C: and D: drives, thus erasing the system
data.  The strings "*** Vengeance is ours! ***", "$ SKISM/Phalcon
'92 $" and "PATH=*.COM" can be found unencrypted in the body of the
virus which is appended to the infected file.  The name of the
infected file is also found, but this does not transfer to
subsequently infected files.  Infection is by "direct action": one
.COM file will be infected each time the virus is invoked.
Activation date is on the 20th of each month.

Subject: 15xx problems (PC)

My brother recently asked me to disinfect his computer as scan
reported that he had been infected with the 15xx virus.  After
verifying I ran clean to remove the virus.  Then I installed vshield
(both wer v89) Thinking everything was now clean we started doing some
more work.  Vshield then caught 15xx again and notified me.  I ran
clean again thinking that somehow I missed something.  Sure enough a
little while later another file seemed to be infected.  I then scanned
again with the all parameter.  It picked up an infected file in one of
the subdirectories.  When I ran scan again with that file name it
didn't seem to identify it.  I went into the subdirectory and found a
file with a name something like '.xxxxx.exe' I can't remember the name
but the important thing is that it started with a period.  I deleted
it and ran a scan again on all files.  Everything seemed clean.  I
recently found out that 15xx mutates.  After telling my brother that
he may still be infected, he told me that might explain why he has
been freezing randomly on boot up (right after vshield finishes
checking memory).  It also seems like a few more files have been
corrupted.  So how do I get rid of this and make sure that none of the
floppies are infected?

Thanks

Subject: On integrity checking (PC)

Hey, Vesselin, all that talk about knew products and detecting unknown
viruses...  Blech.  Wouldn't this fool an integrity checker, if the
virus were installed to a new system.  Maybe install a bad term, makes
it sound intentional.  If the system were infected...:

Assume a stealth virus, which disinfected on the fly - really flying -
disinfecting on file opens, reinfecting on a file close, and also on
findfirst/next calls.  If the virus is unknown to the integrity
checker, then woulnd't it fake it out if it were in memory at the time
of the scanning?

Making a multi-partite infector could have some other interesting
options,0as well thrown in, and make inital infection much easier if
the integrity checker had a memory resident part notifying you of a
change to a file...

Or is there something I am missing?

Hi.

On a local BBS, a file called SCAN95.ZIP was uploaded, with the claim
it was fetched from McAfee Associates BBS - as well as some other
files.  The upload was reported to me by the SYSOP of the
above-mentionned BBS.

What are these files (beside SCAN their names escape me)?  Alpha

I do not mind getting the files and making them available on the net,
but I'd like to be sure first...

Thanks in advance, Claude.

That's because it _HAS_ changed.  When you boot back to DOS you are
using a different boot sector. I don't use boot manager myself but I
use dual boot and experience exactly what you're talking about.  The
simple solution would be to check your boot sectors under either DOS
or OS/2 (but not both) and stick to that or else use separate .SID and
.SRL (sector ID and Sector reload) files for each system.  You could
use a batch file to switch the files when you boot the other operating
system.

Also, as I understand it, Boot Manager may switch the active
partition.  This change alters the master boot record (AKA partition
sector).  If this is the sector IM is reporting as changed, (it calls
the MBR the "partition sector" as opposed to the "DOS Boot sector" to
avoid confusion.

What do you mean by "self executing" program?

All boot sectors may contain a program.  Integrity Master does not
talk about "self executing" programs so I'm baffled as to what you are
asking about here.

Please be more specific.  What problem does it say there is.  I have
gone out of my way to make sure that Integrity Master is very clear
and very specific.  It uses simple language to explain exactly what it
finds wrong.  It won't just say "there is a problem", it will say
exactly what is wrong and also suggest what might have caused the
problem and then suggest specific steps to correct the problem.

You're correct; battery failure is the most likely explanation for
these symptoms.

Yes, please see my prior comments.

See my prior comments.  All of your boot sectors contain executable
code or do you mean something else by "self booting"?

This sounds normal, you need not be concerned by this.

A virus or trojan certainly could modify your CMOS but this is much
more likely to happen due to hardware or software glitch or even an
unknowledgeable user executing the setup program on your PC.

Subject: Unix servers and DOS viruses (PC) (UNIX)

Well, it's worse than I thought it would be.  Unix experiments through
last night showed that viruses succeeded in infecting files that
didn't have read or write access.  I could even run programs with no
read, write, or execute privileges!  It seems that the Unix networking
allows far more than the access controls permit to the local Unix
user.  Directory protection seemed to work right, but then, I was able
to load and execute files from directories with only Execute
permission - not a good sign.

I got a lot of mail about the last posting.  I don't think I'm a
moron, and if someone can break Novell in 2 days, I don't think the
situation gets better by spending more time.  Novell version 3.11 - I
used the default installation with no 3rd party software - I do know
the difference between file attributes and directory rights, and the
inheritence does indeed work the oposite of the way the manual
describes it.  I am replacing the renowned virus marketing expert John
McAfee at the Vbull conference - first speaker on the first day - I
think.  Full details of the experiments will be published at that
conference, and after we get some more experiments done, I hope to
submit to Computers and Security.  Perhaps some of you should read the
paper before making assumptions and calling me names.  In anticipation
of more questions about Unix, System V3.2 with Sun's PC/NFS on the
PCs.  Default installation - I still don't think I'm a moron - No I
haven't tried setting the file system to Read-Only, I am only looking
at how an average network might be installed by an average
administrator, not at how the world's leading expert on Novell might
do it after spending a year to get it right.  Want to repeat the
experiment?  I think the paper provides adequate documentation to
allow a thorough repetition, and we repeated the test with independent
people watching to make sure we weren't doing something wrong.  By the
way, the peron installing the Novell has done a number of commercial
installations before, and to claim that they know nothing about how to
make Novell safe is confirmation of the fact that it is hard to
understand the way inheritence, rights, and attributes work together,
and that many Novell installations may be unsafe.  I doubt if any
legitimate and knowledgeable people from Novell will disagree with my
findings once they come to the conference and/or read the paper.

	Which brings me to one last point.  I got a lot of complaints,
but only one person wanted to perform similar experiments to confirm
our results.  There is a big risk associated with unconfirmed (or
refuted) results.  I don't believe all I read either, but if I really
want to know, I repeat the experiment or ask for more details.

AP "Wire" (I suspect he got it off Compuserve):

Online Today

CANADIAN CHARGED WITH PLANTING ALDUS COMPUTER VIRUS

  (Aug. 20)
  Former Canadian computer magazine publisher Richard Brandow, 28,
has been accused of planting a computer virus that tainted thousands
of copies of Aldus Corp. software in 1988.
  According to The Associated Press, Brandow, who now writes for
"Star Trek," has been charged by prosecutors in King County,
Washington with malicious mischief and could face up to 10 years in
on if he is convicted.
  Brandow said he finds the charges surprising. "What are they going
to do?" he asked, "It happened four years ago, and I am here in
Montreal."
  He told AP that he arranged for a message to flash briefly on
computer screens that wished peace "to all Macintosh users around the
s were designed to educate the public
to the danger of viruses. Brandow included his name in the message so
he could be contacted.
  The virus made its way eventually to Aldus where it infected a
master disk for producing copies of Freehand, an illustration
program. After the virus was discovered, Aldus recalled 5,000 copies
of Freehand and replaced another 5,000 copies it had in its
inventory. The incident cost the firm $7,000.
  Ivan Orton, King County senior deputy prosecuting attorney, told AP
it was the first time the state has brought such criminal charges. He
also said he believes the incident was the first time a virus had
tainted commercial software.

Subject: Network Virus protection. Help.

We currently have 10 DOS based machines and 10 Macintosh machines
spread out in 10 medical student labs.  Although we have been very
lucky and only the Mac's have ever been infected with a virus, we are
about to network these machines together.  We will be using Novell
Netware 3.11 with an Intel 486 server running Windows 3.1 on the DOS
machines and System 7.01 on the Mac's.

What are the best (cost/capability) approaches to virus protection
that we should consider.  Are there any virus protection packages that
are NLM's and are they reasonably priced?  Based on discussions on
this list I have been leaning toward using F-PROTECT for the DOS
machines and DISINFECTANT for the Mac's.  Of course I will gladly pay
the shareware fees.  I would even entertain purchasing a set of
protectors if there are significant operational or detection
advantages.

Any help would be appreciated.

                        (c) Brain - part 2

Who wrote the Brain virus?

Well, it's quite simple really.  In one of the most common Brain
versions you will find text, unencrypted, giving the name, address
and telephone number of Brain Computer Services in Pakistan.  The
virus is copyright by "ashar and ashars", so we have two brothers
running a computer store who have written a virus.  Simple, right?

(Oh, the danger of simple answers.)

First of all, Alan Solomon's analysis and contention that ashar is
older than Brain is quite convincing.  Also, in the *most* common
version of Brain, the address text does not appear.  Further, it
would be a very simple matter to have overlaid the text in the ashar
or Brain programs with the address text.

What motive would the owners of Brain Computer Services have for the
writing of a virus?  One story is that they sell pirated software, a
practice that is legal in Pakistan, but not in the United States.
Therefore, the infected disks were sold to Americans in punishment
for their use of pirated software.  Unconvincing.  The moral
attitude seems quite contorted, Brain would have no reason to
"punish" the United States (its major source of software) and the
Brain infection is not limited to the western world.

Another story is that Brain wrote some software of their own, and
were incensed when others pirated *their* software.  Unlikely.
Infected disks would be most likely to be sold by Brain Computer
Services, and this would tend to mean that a customer would be more
likely to get a "clean" copy if it was pirated.  (The hypothesis
that Brain is some kind of copyright device is absurd: the virus
would then be going around "legitimizing" bootleg copies.)

Given that Brain is relatively harmless it is possible that the
virus was seen as a form of advertising for the company.  Remember
that this is the earliest known MS-DOS virus, and that the hardened
attitude against viral programs had not yet arisen.  Brain predates
both Lehigh and Jerusalem, but even some time after those two
"destructive" infections viral programs were still seen as possibly
neutral or even beneficial.  In those early, innocent days, it is
not impossible that the author saw a self-reproducing program which
"lost", at most, 3k of disk space as simply a cute gimmick.

Sorry, it was not I, I have no opinion on the naming of the 1813

Oops, Rob Slade, not Padgett. Apologies, I've been overworked lately.
