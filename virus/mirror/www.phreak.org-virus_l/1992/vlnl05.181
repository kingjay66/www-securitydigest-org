VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  (The complete set of posting guidelines is available by
FTP on cert.sei.cmu.edu or upon request.) Please sign submissions with
your real name.  Send contributions to VIRUS-L@LEHIGH.EDU.
Information on accessing anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue
archives is distributed periodically on the list.  A FAQ (Frequently
Asked Questions) document and all of the back-issues are available by
anonymous FTP on cert.org (192.88.209.5).  Administrative mail
(comments, suggestions, and so forth) should be sent to me at:

Subject: Administrivia - a new FAQ, and proposed new V-L message ordering

VIRUS-L/comp.virus readers:

A new V-L/c.v FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions (and answers)) document
will be posted to the group in the next day or so.  It is currently
available by anonymous FTP on cert.org (192.88.209.5) in
pub/virus-l/FAQ.virus-l, or by e-mail from listserv@lehigh.edu (just
send a note to that address saying, "info virus-l").  It will also be
posted to news.answers periodically.  My thanks to everyone that
helped out in this release!

On another note, a V-L subscriber recently requested that I change the
ordering of messages in each digest such that non-PC postings come
first, followed PC postings and the rest of the postings.  The
rationale for this request was that the PC postings make up the vast
majority of the messages on V-L/c.v, so non-PC people could locate the
messages of interest to them quicker.  Your comments and suggestions
are welcomed.

Cheers,

Ken

I have tested 2.06a for the bugf you reported. I/We cannot reproduce
it on our machines!!

So probably Frisk cannot do it either, and that makes it difficult for
anyone to help you with your problem.

Try again and be sure that you either have installed all files -
belonging to 2.06a (I had a similar problem reported from a user had
an earlier version of FRISK's database on his disk) on your harddisk,
or the program diskette in a drive!!

Hope this might
help

I don't know what Vscan is, but when comparing the virus-related
stuff, F-Prot is much superior to NAV, IMNSHO... F-Prot doesn't have
the same flashy interface (which I don't like, BTW), but has better
virus detection, -much- better virus removal (although I claim that
disinfecting viruses is a bad idea), better virus identification,
- -much- better virus classification, seems faster (I'm not certain
about this; it's difficult to tell the difference on a '486), uses
(slightly) less memory, etc.

Both, I guess... But we have a virus expert (Jimmy Kuo) from Symantec
who is reading this forum, so he might be able to provide you any
additional information...

> Approximately how many viruses does it detect? 

Haven't done detailed tests recently, but I would bet that version
2.1 (and I have not heard about a newer version) detects less than 90%
of the viruses in our collection... Probably something around 60-85%,
but I am unable to supply a more reliable number right now, and the
above number is -not- reliable (i.e., it is not based on recent tests).

> Does it detect all the "important" viruses? 

Probably, yes. Define "important".

> How often is it upgraded?

Hm, I don't know... You should ask Symantec about this.

Ooops, as several people pointed me out, I've got my activation dates
messed up. The virus activates on November 1 and March 15, not the
other way around. Sorry for the misunderstanding.

tck@bend.ucsd.edu (Kevin Marcus) writes:

> Yeah, please post up a description.

The virus is a memory resident COM file infector. File size increases
by 4096 bytes. The installation check ("Are you there?") is INT
21h/AX=424Fh; if it returns 4D42h in AX, this means that the virus is
resident. The virus infects on file execution only; not on copying.
True Execs are intercepted (AX=4B00h), which means that no overlays
will be infected. The virus is not encrypted and contains two plain
text strings: "COMMANDER BOMBER WAS HERE" and "[DAME] [DAME]". The
"COMMAND" part of the first string is used to check the names of the
infected files - the virus refuses to infect a file, the name of which
begins like that. Therefore, the file COMMAND.COM will not be
infected. The virus does not infect files smaller than 5120 bytes. The
type of the file is checked (both MZ and ZM checks are performed) and
only true COM-type files are infected. The date and the time of the
infected files are preserved, but the attributes are not. The ReadOnly
attribute will not stop the virus from infecting the file, although it
will remain turned off after the infection.

Well, essentially, this is all. All of the viral code, that is. It
occupies about 560 bytes. The remaining is code aimed to conceal the
virus entry point. The virus can reside anywhere in the COM file.
Furthermore, it consists of about a dozen tiny parts and one main
body. The tiny parts do essentially nothing - just a few insignificant
instructions and then transfer control to the next part. The
generation of these parts is very polymorphic; meaning that they can
be -very- different from one infected file to another. The main part
is not even encrypted, which means that it can be detected with a
simple (even not a wildcard) scan string, but in order to do this, the
scanner must scan the -whole- file (which slows down the scanning
considerably). Smart tricks like scanning at the file entry point, or
at the beginning and at the end of the file only, do not work with
this virus.

The second string found in the virus suggests that Dark Avenger
(because he is the author of this Commander Bomber virus) intends to
combine it with the MtE polymorphic mechanism for variable encryption.
Detecting MtE with a scanner now is a nightmare, even if you know that
the file entry point points to it. Detecting an MtE-based virus with
the MtE-generated decryptor which can reside just anywhere in the file
will be a double nightmare, if you care not to produce any false
positives... Fortunately, it is not so easy thing to do...

It is is obvious that the Commander Bomber virus is yet another
"demonstration" virus, like Dedicated. It is an attempt to show that
known-virus scanners can be made obsolete. It is also a buggy virus -
due to some reasons (not clear to me yet), the virus crashes after
some infections. Other than that, there is no destructive payload in
it (or any other payload for that matter).

The above remark would be fine if we were discussing a beta version of
a program, or a theoretical approach how to detect this virus. But,
hey, we are discussing a widely used known-virus scanner! In this
particular case it means that it is not able to reliably detect this
virus! Any comments about it "being on the right track" is simply
irrelevant! Fortunately, the virus is not spread in the wild - it is
available mainly on the virus exchange BBSes... On the top of that, a
bug in it causes it to crash from time to time...

This is one point where I (and Yisrael Radai, I believe, will support
me) disagree with Dr. Cohen. Deriving the CRC coefficients it
"trivial" only if you have enough file-checksum pairs. If you are
really smart and don't care about the file size, "enough" can be
reduced to "one". However, most self-respecting checksummers also
record the file size, so this is just a theoretical speculation.

Otherwise, i.e., if the checksum database is kept off-line and out of
the reach of the virus, there is no way to derive the CRC
coefficients, without knowing the polynomial used for the CRC. And, if
the virus -does- have access to the signature database, then all bets
are off, since it could go stealth instead, modify the database, and
lots of other nasty tricks.

Not quite exact. The virus tries to infect the hard disk only at boot
time, i.e., when you are trying to boot from an infected diskette. If
the virus is being booted from the hard disk, or if it is already
resident, it doesn't try to infect the hard disk any more. Thus, it
can be disinfected from the hard disk even if it is active in memory,
although this is not generally recommended.

Yes, this is what Yisrael means. It is not possible to achieve 100%
detection of some unknown MtE-based viruses when they are in
unencrypted replicants. However, it is possible to achieve 100%
detection of all known MtE-based viruses in both encrypted and
unencrypted replicants.

All I know is that there is a boot sector infector which SCAN calls
like that. Unfortunately, SCAN is very unreliable in identifying
viruses exactly. On the top of that, I am unable to test it on boot
sector viruses, because I don't have them in live form - only as
binary dumps of the infected boot sectors.

So, I have no clue what the "NOP virus" actually is. Could you please
try to run F-Prot 2.06a on an infected diskette and tell me the
results?

Maybe we should clarify to each other the particular version of CPAV
we are speaking about. The latest version we have here is 1.3. In the
same time, I have seen a clone of the program that is rumored to be
supplied with MS-DOS 6.0 and it doesn't have the unencrypted strings

I was unable to reproduce your problem here. Could you please supply
more information? How much is the amount of free conventional memory
on your machine? Version 2.06 had one bug that caused it to do strange
things when there was not enough memory, but as far as I could test,
it has been fixed in 2.06a - this version checks the amount of free
memory and warns you if it is not enough...

This is essentially what Frans Veldman says in the documentation of
TbScan, but it has to be understood correctly; not followed blindly.
First of all the problem for detecting reliably all MtE-based viruses
(or at least all replicants of the known MtE-based viruses) consists
of two separate and equally difficult problems:

1) Detect all files that contain the MtE-based virus as infected.

2) Do NOT detect any file that DOESN'T contain any MtE-based virus as
infected. In other words - avoid the false positives.

It is possible to do some statistical analysis to see what
instructions are usually present in the MtE-generated decryptor, but
you are running the risk to miss some infected samples. It is also
possible to raise an alert any time you see one of the possible
instructions in the decryptor that actually to the encryption - they
are not that many and the variety of addressing modes uses is also not
that great. But then, you are running the risk to cause a lot of false
positives... The really smart trick is to combine both ideas in a
sensible way and to detect all viruses without any false positives.
Currently very few scanners have achieved this.

Yes, and it seems that all MtE detecting programs are using this. But
it is pretty slim as a clue; you need much more to achieve reliably
MtE detection...

And you'll end up with yet another unreliable MtE detector... :-)

Not quite. It is analogous to the problem for detecting viruses in
self-compressed files. My own opinion is that instead of forcing
everybody's scanner to be able to handle all the dozen
self-compressors available, it would be much better to have the
scanner only warn you about the compression and have a separate
program that can strip the compression off.

However, I agree that if somebody's scanner claims to be able to scan
inside compressed executables, it should be able to do so any find all
viruses that it normally can find in uncompressed files.

NAV 2.1 can detect and disinfect it.

Cansu has the ability to permute a small number of its instructions to
make itself look different.  (12 permutations).  Once in memory, it
has a consistent memory signature.

The strain of Cansu with which we are familiar does not damage
systems.  It only has the capability to display a large V on the
screen.  This large V accounts for its aliases as V-SIGN and BigV.

I guess we can add PA/NJ to the list.  Sigh.  Previously, it had only
been seen in Europe and Southern US.

  A local user believes he had a virus. I am waiting for more
information from him, but I was wondering if anyone could identify the
problem or the virus from the following limited information:

  "There seems to be a new virus on the market right now, and it does
only one thing.. It scramble both FATs and writes them to disk.. So
when you comeback to copy or read or pull a file from that floppy, you
get the ARIF error {Abort, Retry, Ignore, Fail}.. If you have it, you
will find that even a low level format will not clear the problem.
Nortons is about the same, with the virus. Both are useless. The
survival of a perfectly good disk depends on unmarking the 0 sector.
The virus apparently marks this sector bad on the disk and you must
then remove it. Nortons disktool will not even read the disk. It just
throws a low level format screen up. The only way is to go manual or
toss the disk."

  None of the locally prominent viruses resemble this vague
description.  Does anyone have any idea what problem (virus or not)
could scramble both copies of the FAT and mark the first sector of a
floppy as bad?

I'm not sure that I agree with that.  While it's good that the second
generation infections will be detected, (and, presumably, eradicated),
if the original vector for the virus remains undiscovered, further
infections will inevitably occur.  If nothing else, this would be a
continual time waster, as sysadmin's go around cleaning-up detected
instances of the virus and trying to find the source of the problem,
which could be right on their own PC.

Of course, if a person didn't take the time to check the .COM for
virus before converting to .EXE (or compressing with PKLITE/LZE/etc),
s/he is asking for trouble anyway.  But that doesn't exclude a baddy
from doing this on purpose to make the virus harder to detect.
