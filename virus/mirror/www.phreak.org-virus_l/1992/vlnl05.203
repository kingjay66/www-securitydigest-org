Final note - I was just looking at the memory after executing Central
Point Anti-Virus dated 6-15-92 (CPAV.EXE) and found the following 
strings:

"Central Point Anti-Virus...Authors: Eli Shapira...Yuval Sherman",
"CARMEL", "Anti-Virus Version 1.3", "CARMEL Software".

Well, Lotus used to have SMURF so why not.

As always, the adds are overstating the features of the product and do
not mention some of its drawbacks. Of course, it is possible to write
viruses that the product will not stop (and will even not detect). Of
course, its restoring engine cannot disinfect all kinds of viruses.
Nevertheless, the product is -very- good, especially the integrity
checking part of it.

This is an unfounded understatement... The product can deal
successfully with WHOLE CLASSES of unknown viruses and is able to
detect ALMOST ALL types of known viruses.

Yes, of course. One third of 17 known types of virus infection still
means an INFINITE number of unknown viruses that the product is able
to disinfect correctly.

Sigh... It depends on the definition of "in the wild"... It has been
"in the wild" in the Technical University of Sofia, at least for a
short time...

Side note... Till now we all thought that PATH companions are just a
theoretical attack and no such viruses exist yet. Looking carefully at
the source of the TP Worm, I see that it has been not only the first
companion virus, but also the first PATH-companion... When it is first
started on a clean system, in its "initial burst", it spreads a lot of
its spoofing bodies in up to 10 randomly selected directories from the
PATH variable...

Hmm... Very strange... It -should- work... What does %NETDRV% get
replaced with? What DOS version are you using? What command
interpreter (COMMAND.COM/4DOS)? In any case, it is not a problem of
SCAN; it is a problem of the operating environment you are using...

[Moderator's note: I agree that this appears to be a problem with the
operating environment, and I'd like to request that follow-ups get

It is just not possible to do such a detailed comparison, because
there are features present in only one of the products.

No, VIRSTOP doesn't have such feature (yet). Other differences are:

1) VShield can check the authentication codes added to the files by
SCAN /AV (it is a BAD idea to modify other people's files!) and refuse
to run those that are not "checksummed". Unfortunately, this feature
can be trivially bypassed (i.e., it is trivial to write a virus that
adds a correct checksum to the file it infects).

2) VShield can scan a file while it is being copied. VirStop does not
have such a feature yet, although Frisk is promising it since a long
time.

3) VShield uses much more memory than VirStop.

4) VShield can be swapped out to the disk, in order to reduce the
amount of memory used. This slows down the loading of the programs.
VirStop does not have such an option (although Frisk intends to
implement it), but then the memory requirements for VirStop are much
more modest.

5) VShield implements some kind of access control - you can tell it
which programs are allowed to run.

6) VShield can be removed from memory (very BAD idea!).

7) VShield can be installed before a network shell is loaded. With
VirStop, you must either install the program after the network shell,
or run without protection. Frisk is expected to fix that problem soon.

I guess, he is referring to the resident scanner called VIRSTOP.EXE
from the F-Prot package. BTW, the IBM product is not "internal use
only" any more; they have released it as a commercial (but cheap)
product.

Help! My default dos foreground color is Pink not low intensity white.
Is this possibly a virus? I booted from a protected floppy master disk
- - no change!  Virustop runs but identifies no virus. My screen turned
pink in the middle of a Kermit download. I use NOrton contro center
and it indicates that my default color is a pink but in the low
intensity white position in the selection chart. I try to change the
color but when I exit to dos the default is back. Any ides gladly
accepted.

Earlier this year a represtative from Fifth Generation Systems was in
New Zealand showing Untouchable off to the public.  At that time I had
only seen fairly early versions of Untouchable and it definitely was
NOT untouchable.  The newer versions are pretty good though.  Making
random modifications to files or corrupting files doesn't stop
Untouchable for making repairs.  Every time the files come out 100%
restored.  I was quite impressed at the time.

While I am quite impressed with Untouchable, I know of some infection
techniques which it does not detect and cannot recover data from.
Untouchable is not completely generic and it is certainly not
untouchable.  I imagine it won't be long before there are a number of
viruses using infection methods which Untouchable will not detect so
don't put too much faith into it.

CPAV is known to cause SCAN to false alarm on some viruses. CPAV does
not encrypt it's search strings and these that match McAfee's strings
cause it to detect CPAV as a virus.

Just tried the VER /R trick after booting from a (relatively) old floppy
with IO.SYS, MS-DOS.SYS, and COMMAND.COM all dated 03-22-91 5:10a. Guess
what the report was:

MS-DOS Version 5.00
Revision A
DOS is in low memory

Further, COMP finds no difference between this COMMAND.COM and the one I
just expanded from a new set of distribution disks that is dated 11-11-91.

However, COMP *does* find a difference between the earlier CHKDSK.EXE and
the one dated 11-11-91, which has a three byte change (to make sure that
the CH value is cleared ?)

Assuming that this is causing the problem, DEBUG will find the string: 

 8b 4f 0f 8b f9 (MOV CX,[BX+0F] MOV DI,CX) at offset ds:263e in the "old" and
 8b 7f 0f 32 ed (MOV DI,[BX+0F] XOR CH,CH) is at the same offset in the "new"

CHKDSK.EXE. Both are 16,200 bytes long.

Sounds like there may be more than one revision A  (or why ver /r is
undocumented).

                                        Warmly,
                                                Padgett

Note: this was done without any advice/observations from Mircrosoft &
      only represents what I found in minimal testing. Caveat y'all.

Subject: OS2-stuff (OS/2)

Hi folks,
I have downloaded from MCAFEE.COM OS2SCAN and OS2CLEAN. I checked
OS2SCAN but not OS2CLEAN, as I don't have any viruses in my system and
hope to keep it so. I ran it on my home-PC, with 2 IDE HDs with HPFS
format. At work I have no OS2, but at home I even don't have a modem.

What I found to be improved:
1) You state in the documentation, that there are several switches, which do
not exist in the OS2 versions. But if you invoke "OS2SCAN /? " you will see
all switches available under DOS. You should update these pages of help.
2) After scanning is finished, the program asks constantly if I want more
help. "OS2SCAN C: D:" does not ask for help, does it?
3) Watching the filenames that pop up for short, I got the impression, that
OS2SCAN does not scan *.DLL, *.DRV, *.ADD files. You can correct this either
with /A or /E switch. But these do belong to the standard executables and it
should not be necessary to think about these. Probably there are more ex-
tensions to be included.
4) Did you think of the built-in undelete-function ? I hope the /D switch
works correct. You need to overwrite first, and then delete the file to en-
sure it does not survive as a deleted shadow.
5) A minor problem, but still annoying for OS2ers: VALIDATE should become a
genuine OS2 program. For shure it does not need a fancy outfit, but why do I
have to start a DOS session, just see the results of VALIDATE ? If I in-
voke VALIDATE from an OS2-window a DOS window is created and closed immediately
after it finished. I know, I could change the settings, but why do I have to
do this for a single check ?
6) Another nice thing I miss is a background-scanner, that checks all in-
coming files, be they from floppy or modem or whatever. Probably you can't
check what the floppy is reading, but you can do a check on all newly
appeared files on HD. I admit, that I still have no idea, how to check files
executed from floppy. But at least all or specified drives could be scanned
every n miutes or on request.
7) Maybe a kind of *.INI file could help to maintain the settings like drives
and directories to scan and a userdefineable list of extensions and other
often used options instead of writing them directly into OS2SCAN. I know of
the parameterfiles you can create, but wouldn't look an interactively created
setup (like the one you have in WSCAN) much nicer ?

8) SCAN for DOS rel.9.0 V99 (most recent on Dec. 12th, 1992) does not do any-
thing within a OS2 DOS-box. Neither windowed nor fullscreen. Although I read
the readme.1st and *.DOC, where I found a suggestion to use the /MAINT switch
and/or the /AD option, it either told me it can not access my HPFS-drives
(no options or /AD) or that D: is incompatible with /MAINT (/AD /MAINT) or no
errors were reported for scanning drive C: (scan c: /maint), but nothing was
scanned (no disk-access) and the program returned almost immediately.
9) In Virlist I found a passage for the fam*-viruses where no information
is provided about their behaviour. Is this correct ? And if so, why ?
I thought, that Mutation Engine is a .OBJ-file to be linked with viral coding.
So DAME itself would not be a virus to be listed this way in VIRLIST.TXT.
It would be better to introduce a new column for viruses using MtE.

10) I did some testing on F-Prot 2.06a too. The /NOBOOT switch is the thing to
make it run on HPFS drives. What I miss in COMMANDS.DOC is the /EXT= switch
to force scanning of other extensions. Especially within WINDOWS and OS2 we
find extensions like *.DLL, *.DRV and the like. The should be scanned by
standard too, as they contain executable code like any *.OV?. Also an example
in the *.doc file for /EXE=switch would be nice. I did not manage to make it
recognise multiple extentions. Does it work and if, what is the delimiter ?
11) A thing I could not recreate, but looking kind of funny: I did a heuristic
scan on all drives and all files. No viruses found so far, but a suspicious
file: my C-compiler (QC 2.5). It didn't say it looks like a virus or so, but
there are opcodes which will make the program crash. "CRASH" was the word it
used. Maybe due to the fact, that F-Prot checked for the CPU and found itself
running within a virtual 8086. Frisk?

12) As Vesselin is getting sick of reiterating his answers on faqs: how about
posting the last recent faq-list ? I think it is almost a full year, since the
members of this list received one. Nobody seems to download and read it by
him/herself. I suggest that faqs should be answered in a way like:
email to "listserv@lehigh.edu" with the letterbody  "get faq-list" (not exactly
to be copied, but you know what I mean)
13) A more special question. I hope I didn't miss it in the faq-list: What is
exactly a companion virus? I mean, under which circumstances does it infect
and in which environments. Somehow I have the impression, they are especially
dangerous within networks. Vesselin? Padgett? Anybody?
14) Sometimes even mailers seem have their DEJA VU ... :)

Subject: SCAN for OS/2 uploaded to mcafee.COM... (OS/2)

I have uploaded to mcafee.com

pub/antivirus
OSCAN99.ZIP     SCAN for OS/2 Version 99 scans OS/2 PC's for viruses

VIRUSCAN for OS/2

This is the first release of SCAN for OS/2 (OS2SCAN).
Like it's DOS-based counterpart, VIRUSCAN (for DOS), OS2SCAN
searches PC's for computer viruses. However, OS2SCAN contains
several important differences:

- -     Since OS/2 operates in a protected mode environment it can
      only check its own area of memory or "memory image" for
      viruses.  Viruses in a DOS session or VDM will not be
      detected in memory by OS2SCAN.

- -      OS2SCAN checks "extended filenames" and HPFS-partitioned
       drives as well as DOS (FAT) drives.

- -      OS2SCAN does not have the /CHKHI, /M, /MAINT, /NOMEM,
       or /UNATTEND switches that VIRUSCAN does.

- -      The /SAVE switch does not modify the OS2SCAN.EXE file.
       Instead, it creates a SCAN.INI file.

- -      OS2SCAN does not return an ERRORLEVEL for DOS batch files.

OS2SCAN Version 99 detects all viruses the current version of VIRUSCAN
does and is otherwise similar to VIRUSCAN.

NOTE:  OS2SCAN requires IBM OS/2 Version 2.00(GA) or above.


VALIDATE for OS/2

To validate the OS2SCAN.EXE file for changes and/or tampering, a new
version of the VALIDATE program has been created, OS2VAL.EXE.  It
should be used to validate all OS/2 executable files, as the DOS-based
VALIDATE.COM will return incorrect information for Check Method 1 if
run against an OS/2 .EXE file.


OTHER OS/2 PROGRAMS

CLEAN-UP for OS/2 (OS2CLEAN.EXE) is still in the beta-test cycle and
should be available around the end of the month.


VALIDATE values are as follows:

SCAN FOR OS/2 V99 (OS2SCAN.EXE)     S:178,352  D:12-09-92   M1: 78A3  M2: 10CA
VALIDATE for OS/2 (OS2VAL.EXE)      S:39,824   D:12-09-92   M1: BFD6  M2: 09DB

HISVIRM.CVP   921022
 
                    CHRISTMA Wannabes - part 2
 
(continued from last week ...)
 
In December of 1988, VMS systems on DECNet networks were hit by a
worm based on a file called HI.COM.  COM files on VMS systems are
similar to the REXX exec files and MS-DOS "batch" files.  They are
"programs" in VMS DCL "source" code.  HI.COM used the fact that
DECNet nodes had, by default, a standard "anonymous" account that
could be used, by the network and other machines, to gain limited
access to a machine.  This account was able to start processes
running.  The process that HI.COM started was intended to replicate,
submit itself to other machines, to inform a specific account at a
specific site, and to wait until midnight on December 24th, 1988,
and then start mailing Christmas greetings to all users.  The
content of the message and the notification address seemed to
indicate a German author with access to an account in France.  The
first notifications of this infestation came from the NASA SPAN
network and the US Department of Energy's HEPNET.
 
HI.COM owed a number of features to the Morris worm.  One was a
"stealth" technique, whereby the file was copied into memory and
then erased from the disk.  Another stealth procedure used by HI.COM
was the use of a process name suggestive of normal mail routines.
 
Spring of 1989 saw a resurgence of interest in mutating the original
CHRISTMA on VM systems.  A modified version (BUL EXEC) was released
from the EARN backbone site in Turkey on March 8, ORGASM EXEC was
released from Pennsylvania State University on April 4, and HEADACH
EXEC found at the University of Ottawa on April 8.  DIR EXEC,
discovered November 1989, purported to be a version of the MS-DOS
DIR command for VM systems, but was a dropper for CHRISTMA.  There
was a Turkish version EXEC in November 1990, called TERM MODULE, and
a reposting of CHRISTMA EXEC to alt.hackers in December of 1990. 
The latest reported sighting was as GAME2 MODULE in January 1991.
 
The WANK/W.COM worm of October 1989, and its successor, owed most of
its inspiration (if you can call plagiarism inspiration) to the
Morris worm and HI.COM.
 
Finally, there was the XA1 Christmas Tree PC virus in March 1990. 
Although it owed no technical or programming detail to any of the
network worms, it seems to have been written "in memoriam".  It
contains (in German) the message, "And still it is alive : The
Christmas Tree !"
