Subject: Reading on Novell & virus defenses (PC)

   Novell's Netware Application Notes dated March 1992 contained an
excellent article titled "Detecting Viruses in the Netware Environment" by
Mr. Morgan B. Adair.
   It is a realistic overview of the virus problem as far as Netware LANs
are concerned and provides useful info on many issues such as why boot
sector infector cannot infect the server from a workstation, and describes
a scenario a LAN admin may face.
   It also includes a section titled Prescriptions. Although concise and
well-done, the article seems to underestimate the trouble a LAN admin can
get in if a virus manages to infect commonly used apps on the server.
Downtime in such cases are usually longer than just an hour or two, not
because the server recovery takes long but because of the fear and
confusion it entails.
   It is usually difficult to contain the spread in networked environments
because the number of virus entry points are numerous, not because the
server cannot be cleaned easily. Reinfection is a bigger problem in such
cases. Anyway, interested individuals are encouraged to read the mentioned
document at their convenience.

   Here are some specific comments on the article:

   On page 7:
      "Some viruses also infect overlay files (.OVL) or the hidden DOS
system files (IBMBIO.SYS and IBMDOS.SYS or IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS)."

   Comment: This is a little misleading. It is not common for DOS viruses
to target hidden DOS system files. In fact, they are avoided. BTW, it is
IBMBIO.COM and IBMDOS.COM on many systems.

   On page 10:
      "Resident Above Top of Memory, but Below 640K. A large number of
viruses place themselves resident at the top of memory, just below the
640K boundary. They then redirect BIOS interrupt 12h, which reports the
total amount of conventional memory available in the system."

   Comment: Most viruses do not hook Int 12h for such a purpose. Many boot
sector infectors simply reduce the value at 40:13, which contains the base
memory size. File infectors remain resident by directly manipulating  DOS
memory control blocks to protect themselves. This, again, does not require
hooking Int 12h.

   On page 18:
      "If you suspect a virus infection:
         Do not log in as SUPERVISOR.
         Power off the suspect machine.
         ...
      "

   Comment: Although, this advice is reasonable, a better approach exists.
Creation of an account, say HUNTER, which has only FILESCAN and READ
rights on every file in every directory. HUNTER can safely scan the whole
server even when his workstation is infected, and the virus is active.
Since HUNTER cannot write to any executables, the virus cannot spread.

   Non-Malicious Hackers (NMHs) take note: The article also mentions a
program, rather an NLM, that provides integrity checking for Netware
servers. The source code (in C) is supposedly available by mailing in a
card.

Some of our PC compatibles have been infected by DIR-2 virus. It was
detected with SCAN86 but not cleaned. Attempts to clean with SCAN86
damaged more files.

What can we do? Please e-mail directly. Thanks for any help.

I can really recommend F-PROT. I just tested several scanners against
my virus collection and F-PROT 2.03a catched almost all of them (98%).
Dr Solomon's Anti-Virus Toolkit 5.56 detected only one virus less than
F-PROT though.

I must disagree with you on this point, Tarkan. More and more users in
the Intel world are using the items Vesselin mentioned and many
others. In fact, what you claim as a "standard" PC system is becoming
an endangered species.

(I love this part:)

How can your software package be the strongest software solution
available, yet not be for everyone? It seems to me that you may have a
very good package for a limited user base, but if it can't be run on
every system configuration that someone might use, it's not a really
viable package in the current market. I can (for example) user F-Prot,
which works under every setup I've been able to throw at it, and I can
use it for FREE! As far as I can tell, because I haven't taken the
time to test it, your program may be just as effective as F-Prot, yet
you imply it's better because it won't run on my Stacker-ed hard disk,
and F-Prot will. Sorry, I can't buy that.

>And if you repartition the hard drive, re-installation is a safe bet.
>On alike machines, it may work fine, but why not install it as intended.

I'll give you a darn good reason: computer-phobic students. I pass out
F-Prot to any student who wants it that comes into my lab, and they
*very simply* go home and copy it on their hard disk. Boom. I even
wrote a thorough stupid- user batch file for installation for those
kids who don't even know how to do a directory on their computer at
home. What's the point in doing backups of your software if you have
to reinstall packages every time you make a change on your hard disk
or it crashes and you get to start from scratch?

I'm sorry, but I just can't see using a program that has limited use
on different hardware/software/OS configurations and recommends
reinstallation (not a trivial task from the description I read) any
time a change is made.  I hope you and your organization rethink your
approach.

In my experience, these "exceptions" are the rule with people who use
virus protection.  If a user has the experience/presence of mind to
install virus protection, I'd give good odds he/she is a fairly
advanced user, and may well have Stacker, DR-DOS, NDOS, $DOS, or any
of a number of "exceptions" which make a PC easier to use.  What if a
user shells to DOS from Windows and tries to use your program?

This is quite apparent.  It seems to make poor economic sense to limit
the compatibility of your product so tightly.  You had some good
ideas, it is a pity those who are best suited to use them can't.

>> Besides, the decoys seem to be launched only in the root directory, so
>> it's pretty easy to program the virus to avoid them.

>  Aha, a direct attack. Yes, you are correct, that is always possible.

Vesselin seems to have been a bit unfair here.  It is a given that a
virus can be written to evade any given detection scheme it knows
about.  But we have so many virus detection methods that is seems
impossible to write a common virus that will evade ALL detection
schemes.

I really like your idea of launching "decoys".  I use this quite a bit
to see if my system is infected.  If I think I might have a virus, I
pop in a diskette which has been newly formatted or wiped clean, which
has a 4 byte .COM file on it that does nothing but terminate.  If I
notice any changes in the file (after rebooting from a know clean
disk, of course) odds are I have both proof of viral activity, and a
clean copy of the virus for analysis.

This method is far from foolproof, it is merely another layer in my
virus defense armada. (Scanners, heuristics, TSR virus interceptors,
integrity checkers, and common sense.)  For example, Cinderella won't
infect my file since it is less than 390 bytes long.

Here is the tiny file, uuencoded, for any who wish to use this method
of virus detection.

Subject: Impossible error occurred in SCANV V89B (PC)

I don't really know where to send the report, here seems like a good place.
The other day, scan v89b reported something like:

Impossible error occurred:  Error number 4494

And it immediately aborted.
Well, normally, I would not be so picky, but since it is a virus scanning
program, I'd very much like to know what this supposedly impossible error
is all about?

Anyone from McAfee who cares to comment about this?
In case it helps, it was a 80286 running MSDOS 5.0

I've been hit by a virus that slows my PC down to almost the speed of
an XT !  It happened at 17:30 (ish) Thursday 23rd April GMT to two
other machines as well.

Scan 89B was not able to detect it. After a while it disappeared

I have uploaded to WSMR-SIMTEL20.Army.Mil:

pd1:<msdos.trojan-pro>
HTSCAN17.ZIP    HTScan virus scanner v1.17; needs VSIGyy##.ZIP
VSIG9204.ZIP    Virus signatures for HTSCAN/TBSCAN - 920412

Please note there was a version number mismatch in the description of
the previous version of HTSCAN (it read 1.6 and should have been 1.16).

Here is an excerpt from the `whatsnew.doc':

Version 1.17 (April 1992)

- - Starting with version 1.17 HTScan will be available in several languages.
- - With /$? it is possible to get help for the advanced options.
- - A new option /$M has been introduced. With this option you can specify a
  directory to which infected files should be moved.
- - An other new option /$U has been introduced for running unattended. When
  used HTScan will not ask whether a file should be moved, renamed or deleted.
- - The boot-record markers are no longer checked. This will eliminate the high
  number of warnings about an unusual boot-sector.
- - HTScan now supports AVR's (Algorithmic Virus Recognition) modules.
- - HTScan will use the new ADDNSIGS.DAT file.
- - HTScan now check's the checksum in VIRSCAN.DAT
- - HTScan now supports external compressed file signatures in the file
  COMPRSCA.DAT
- - HTScan will abort with errorlevel 75..99 if a run-time error occurred.
- - It is now possible to generate a more accurate message with the first
  character of the signature.
