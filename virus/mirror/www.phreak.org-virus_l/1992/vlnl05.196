As soon as I get the newer version, I'll redo the tests and will
publish the results - just as I did with SCAN 99.

Maybe, but I had no way to know that. I just used the latest version
available to me.

Acknowledged. Although I interpreted the handwriting on the diskette
as "NAV 2.1 (on the first line) 114 (on the second line)". But I admit
that the character that looked like "1" to me can be indeed recognized
as "beta". However, the program itself (when run) DOES NOT identify
itself as a beta version.

:-). Well, McAfee Associates complained that I have not used a recent
enough version. You are complaining that I have used a "too recent"
(i.e., beta) version... :-)

Anyway, I am doing my best to publish proper test results. As soon as
a newer version of any of the tested scanners is received by me, I'll
redo the tests and will publish the results. In the cases when the
product is shareware, I can get it myself. However, with the
commercial products, I am forced to use whatever is sent to me. This
holds not only for your product - I suspect that the versions of Dr.
Solomon's scanner I am using are all betas, not yet shipped to the
customers. I have received more than a dozen of copies of the German
product AntiVir IV (from H+BDEV) and all of them were marked as beta
versions. Since I don't have anything else, I have used the latest of
them in the MtE detection tests. And so on.

Ah, c'mon! There are two modules - the random number generator and the
MtE itself. The RNG is supplied in source and is short; the MtE is
supplied only as an .OBJ file and is long, sophisticated and hard to
understand. If anybody can change -it- this is Darkie himself. On the
other side, it is relatively trivial to change the RNG. I sincerely
hope that nobody is stupid enough to pick a signature for their
scanner from the RNG...

OK, but you still didn't answer my question. My question was aimed
towards those who think that they can live with imperfect detection.
Note, I didn't say imperfect MtE detection - after all, the current
MtE-based viruses are not spread at all.

My question is just that: suppose you are given a scanners that misses
one infected file in every N for a particular virus. For what values
of N will be happy to live with? If there is no simple answer, i.e.,
if the answer is related with the value of the information on your PC,
with the speed increase as a function of N, with the spread of the
virus that is missed, then just give me some examples. Not only you; I
am asking this questions to all readers of Virus-L/comp.virus. Also
consider the possibility that there -are- some scanners which will
- -not- miss any infected files AND will not give any false positives.

What do you mean by "the files can't readily be repaired"? That the
MtE-based viruses cannot be disinfected? But this is simply not true;
there are several product on the market which a doing this. Or, at
least, they are claiming to do it - I have not done detailed tests,
because (1) testing for disinfection is more difficult (all your test
set has to be rebuilt after each test) and (2) I have always claimed
that virus disinfection is a bad idea.

But, if you are interested, CPAV 1.3 does disinfect some MtE-based
viruses, AntiVir IV too... A Russian anti-virus program from Eugene
Kaspersky does it too, but I have not received a copy of it yet, so I
cannot test it. Furthermore, the generic disinfector TbClean from the
ThunderByte Anti-Virus package (version 5.01, shareware, available
from Simtel20) can be used to disinfect the MtE-based viruses too. It
works most of the time, especially with COM files (with EXE files,
some fields in the EXE header are not restored, but this is properly
explained in the documentation).

If you bother to read the results of my tests carefully, you'll see
that the "big guns" (CPAV, NAV, SCAN) failed, while a small freeware
program (CatchMtE) succeeded...

Agreed. What the user needs is a 100% reliable detector that gives no
false positives. No disagreement here. My point was that some of the
tested scanners -did- achieve this. But NAV 2.1 beta 14 didn't.

What the users actually need is reliable protection. Unfortunately,
they are not competent to evaluate which anti-virus protection is
reliable - they are able to evaluate only the speed, size, easy of
use, etc. That's why I am not testing these things - they can test
them themselves. Besides, the computer magazines are full of
anti-virus reviews that test only the above qualities...

What I am testing is the actual protection that the product provides -
because I have the necessary knowledge to do it. I am publishing my
results, to share this knowledge with the users. I understand very well,
that this is not the quality that "sells" the product, so many
producers are unhappy when I demonstrate that a nice looking, easy to
use, popular product provides in reality a rather poor anti-virus
protection. But this is life and I don't intend to change my position.
If some users disagree with me, they need just to stop reading my
reviews. If some producers of anti-virus software disagree with my
position, they have two options - ignore my messages, or improve their
product. The market will show which alternative is more profitable.

Back to your initial statement, I don't believe that the detection of
MtE-based viruses is only an academical issue. This virus creation
tool is relatively widely available, so we must have also widely
available reliable detectors of the viruses generated with it. It
doesn't matter how spread the -current- MtE-based viruses are - if we
don't have reliable detectors, they (or other MtE-based viruses)
- -will- become widespread.

Furthermore, there -were- full-featured scanners that were able to
show 100% reliable MtE detection in our tests. Some of them seemed to
be even faster than NAV, but I cannot claim this for sure, because I
was not interested in this issue and didn't measure the speed exactly.
Besides, (1) it is rather difficult to measure the speed difference on
a 486, and (2) it is not fair to measure the speed in an infected
environment - because the programs are usually used in a clean
environment. But, it seemed pretty much to me that F-Prot was faster
than NAV. (I do not intend to test this further, anybody who has both
products and test it for him/herself.) Furthermore, the current
detection and disinfection rate of F-Prot is also significantly higher
than the one in NAV, so F-Prot is hardly less "full-featured" than
NAV...

Even if you compare the size, F-Prot is significantly smaller than the
NAV package. What else? OK, F-Prot does not have integrity checking
and monitoring programs, but first those programs in NAV are
relatively trivial to bypass, and second, I don't see how this affects
the MtE detection.

As far as I know, Prof. Eugene Spafford and a few others from Purdue
University are working on a platform-independent user-programmable
scanner. It will be released in source, free of charge. Initially it
will have routines to access Unix file systems, but since it will be
written in C++, nothing will prevent other people from writing the
appropriate interface to DOS, MacOS, AmigaDOS, or whatever. As you see

Yes. :-) An integrity checker has been already released (free, with
full source). Prof. Spafford is involved in its creation too. It is
called Tripwire and is available from cert.org, I think (Ken?). It is
oriented towards the Unix platform, but, hey, you get the full source,
feel free to port it to whatever you want. It includes several
checksum methods, including CRC-32 (with a fixed generator, sigh... I
hope they'll improve this in the next version), Snerfu, MD4, MD5,
MD2... You can even plug your own checksumming method...

In general, that's true, but there are still some "trade secrets"...
:-) Like fast file access, how to implement intelligent file checking
(i.e., only selected parts of the files), anti-stealth techniques,
etc.

> The related question, I suppose, is this: are there any integrity

If you are asking the question like that, then Tripwire is the answer.
But I somehow think that you are meaning a DOS-oriented integrity
checker, right? In this case, I know only about Stealth Bomber. It is
available in source, but first it is not secure enough, and second, it
is not an off-line integrity checker or an integrity shell; it is a
module that you must include in your own programs so that they check
their own integrity when executed.

I am not aware about a DOS-based off-line integrity checker, available
in source. Maybe somebody would volunteer to port Tripwire?

It's, of course, up to Mr. Goretsky to respond, but nevertheless, here
are my two cents worth...

This has been indeed the practice in the past - the version of SCAN
showed the number of viruses that it can detect. However, it is not
like this any more - otherwise we would have 1561, instead of 99
(according to the file VIRLIST.TXT that comes with SCAN 99, it can
detect 1561 different viruses). Even if you count the virus families
only, the version number should be 865 (according to SCAN99.DOC).

Furthermore, McAfee Associates definitively don't need to invent new
viruses or to wait until a new virus appears. Hey, the new versions of
SCAN appear averagely one per month, and currently the appearance rate
of new viruses is up to three per -day-!

Can anyone tell me anything about Jabberwocky/812? One of my users
recently received a DOS disk that contained a packed archive; when she 
unpacked it (on a UNIX system (Sun)) there were a couple of apparently
empty files, (empty to Unix, that is) one of which was called
'jabberwocky.txt'.
Since the system is running Unix, i guess its safe from DOS viruses.

NO PROBLEM!!! What you do is turn off scanning of the boot sector for
your HPFS drive. Otherwise f-prot will work normally. I run f-prot
under os/2 all the time and its quick and easy. I turn off the boot
sector virus detection and run a full check on all my drives (two fat
and one hpfs). Then I go in and specific drive C, do a boot check
only, then drive D, do a book check only, and I'm done.  Takes a
couple of minutes at most. I still recomend f-prot as one of the best
and friendliest programs. I just wish it knew enough to recongize os/2
and not bother even dealing with it. My it will be added, who knows?

God.. v99... scan is making me ill.  A new version every four days.  I
gave up on keeping up. I don't regularly use scan anymore. Its just
too much of a pain for me. I like little menus and the tests that are
reported on this list consistantly show f-prot as being better in all
areas than scan.

>My question:
> What are people running OS/2 using/running as anti-viral software?

Well I use mainly f-prot and Integredity Master. At the present time
its important that you know which files should be unreadable or have
changed and which haven't, otherwise IM will make you crazy.

Also I just bought IBM's new toy, this virus detection program from
their high integredity lab. Unfortunatly I haven't had a chance to
install it yet (all 1.5 frigen megs of it) but apparently its
completely background run. You tell it how often to scan your drive
and it takes care of the rest. You never need to explicitly check it
or deal with it. If theres a problem, it tells you. Also if you want
to get the quarterly updates (all the nifty new scan codes, though
it does offer 'fuzzy scan' (i.e. it looks for viral codes like the
ones it already has) and 'heuristic scan') it costs around $50 for a
full years worth. Kinda steep, but if it works, probably worth it.
I"ll report back to everyone on how it worked on my system.

The number after the "V" _used_ to be the number of viruses detected
by VIRUSCAN (SCAN.EXE).  This is why the first release of VIRUSCAN,
which detected 19 viruses, was called Version 19 instead of Version 1.
When a new virus was discovered, a new release of SCAN was made to
detect it and the version number was incremented.  This continued on
through around the 40's, at which point viruses were coming in faster
then we could release individual versions of VIRUSCAN.  So then what
we started doing is releasing a version that would detect 3 or 5 new
viruses at a time and incrementing the version number by one.  Today,
50+ viruses can be added in a single release, and the version number
will only be incremented by one.

>in order to skip a versionnumber which was already used by a trojan?

When a Trojan horse version appears, we just skip that version number
and go to the next one.

That is correct. IMHO there needs to be a "real-time" component that 
runs essentially unnoticably.

Needs some definition here, I have never seen a system that I could not
break manually that did not encrypt the entire disk (and some that did).

The question is really "is the integrity checker secure enough that it
is easier to disconnect it than to fool it ?". Note that one of my 
requirements is for a different algorithm & seed on each machine (figure
out how to fool A & it won't work on B).

The key word is "yet". It is not difficult to be "Stacker compliant",
any DOS program can do that. The DOS bypass checkers are proof against 
most stealth and *that* is more difficult to do.

Thought I had said (possibly some time ago) that integrity of the *system*
had to be a first priority. Besides, it is simple to say "NO low level
formatting without explicit approval" (something it shouldn't be doing).

>At last, the examples used by you are not very correct. MtE and

Afraid you missed the point. I have seen an IMHO disturbing trend by
some integrity checkers to use a "turbo" mode that only validates the
first and the last bytes of a file. This is not a good thing.

>Is it surprising then that they defeat the

We have discussed this. Again it comes under the heading of "system 
integrity" & is why SafeMBR was able to detect STARSHIP before that
virus had been seen. BRAIN is just as easy to detect.

Agree to a certain extent - I use scanners but mainly as a labor saving
device but feel they should be confined to those who know how to use
them. Disinfectors even more so.

Not in a "complete" system. If I can guarentee that my code will run first
(and with boot selection I can), then that code can be "armoured" and can
be later validated. Now a virus will have to find the armouring and turn it
off before it can change the "20 bytes". Sure, you or I could still spend 
some time with DEBUG and remove it, but software is not going to have an
easy time of it, particularly if I add a few ROM loops into the intercept.

Part of the problem is that what was reasonably simple four years ago has
evolved into a very complex field. I try to keep my postings simple and
confined to a single point but this is getting more and more difficult - 
I regularly spend an hour just discussing what the TOM in an IBM-PC should
look like (e.g. what CHKDSK returns & why MEM may return a different
number).


Am starting to think a book on integrity management and the IBM-PC
architecture (NOT how to write a virus) might not be a bad idea. Now
if I just had some free time...

Subject: Trojan detection/protection (PC)

With my limited understanding of this subject, i assume that a trojan
is NOT technically a virus but a programming modification that alters
programs and causes them to run harmfully. I even saw a trojan batch
file in Digital Free Press (volume 1, issue 4) which would *gasp* do
an absolute write to the first 9 sectors of my Hard drive! How
malicious! I was wondering, how do i protect myself? is there a
version of McAfee's V-Shield for Trojans? and if i do get hit, how do
i go about recovering?!

The number is correct.  I am informed the line has been down on some
of the previous weekends.  Apparently, it needs a manual boot up.

I too would be interested in hearing what people have to say about the 
various memory-resident scanners that are available.  It seems most of
the discussions in this newsgroup tend to focus on the non-resident 
scanners.

In a similar vein, I am a bit curious as to why a version of VSHIELD
is only about half as long (approx. 40K) as the same version of SCAN
(approx. 85K).  What extra things are being done in SCAN that aren't
being done in VSHIELD??

Sigh... It's in the FAQ and I am really tired of answering this
question... You are using CPAV or TNTVIRUS. Their resident part keeps
its scan strings in memory unencrypted. This is what SCAN finds. When
you boot from a floppy, the resident scanner CPAV is not present, so
SCAN finds nothing. Read the docs for CPAV, it plainly says that it is
incompatible with any other anti-virus software.

> Does anyone out there know how we can get rid of the [Filler] virus? 

In this particular case you should just get rid of CPAV...

This is in the FAQ and has been answered here multiple times. An
infection by both Stoned and Michelangelo results in a non-bootable
system which most scanners/removers refuse to disinfect, because the
original MBR is lost. The only way to cure it is to put a new MBR,
which is exactly what FDISK/MBR does. See the FAQ for more details or
scan the back issues of Virus-L/comp.virus.

> So would anyone please tell me what virus is this one, thanks.

You have two of them - Stoned and Michelangelo.

Ha, this gives me an idea! Several people complained that they are
unable to run SCAN 99 on an OS/2 machine. Just an advise: try NETSCAN
99 instead. It might work... If it does, please post the results, I am
curious to find it out too, but don't have an OS/2 machine handy...
