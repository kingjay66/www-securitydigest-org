There are two parts to eliminating the virus.  The first is to put a
correct boot sector back onto the infected floppy, or into the
infected DOS boot sector of the hard disk.  The second, if you are a
sticker for thoroughness, is to recover the disk cluster that the
virus has marked <BAD>, where the second part of the body of the
virus, and the clean boot sector, are hidden.

On floppies it is easy to clean the boot sector, if it has been
infected.  Get a clean boot sector from the same format of diskette.
Programs like Padgett's fixfbr do the job very well, and don't require
getting all that technical.  It can be done quite easily with debug,
too, but then it is a bit more technical.  To restore the boot sector
of a DOS hard disk partition is a bit trickier, because the data
fields in the boot sector that say what the partition's
characteristics are will differ from partition to partition -- there
aren't simply four standard partition sizes.  In this case,you might
have to search the FAT for the cluster that is marked bad, and look
there for your original boot sector.  But here I am getting beyond my
knowledge level.  I don't recall, first, whether FORM uses a fake
<BAD> cluster to hide in, on hard disks, or if that is only done on
floppies.  It may be that when it infects a hard disk partition, the
boot sector is saved in the same area of unused sectors that stoned et
al. use.  Second, I don't recall whether FORM keeps the boot sector's
data fields in place, in the virus, in which case you could get them
from there.  And I'm afraid I don't have time to test it out.  But if
you look around a bit with Norton Utilities, or some such, you might
be able to figure it out, and let me know.

SYS C: should do the trick for hard drives. Or, if you want to 
have a go with NU, DISKEDIT or similar, then you'll find the
original boot sector in its hiding place -- which is the last
physical sector on your drive, if I remember correectly. Just go 
to [maxtrack-1.maxhead-1.maxsect] and have a look -- you should 
find your boot sector there...or thereabouts.

You'll also find, thereabouts, somehwat less than savoury mention

Not surprising. FDISK /MBR refreshes the partition record [0.0.1], or
Master Boot Record, of your hard drive. Form, however, is a "DOS" boot
sector virus -- on your hard drive, it lives in the boot record of the
logical drive C:. SYS C:, as you noticed, refreshes the logical boot
sector, and thus obliterates Form. FDISK doesn't touch the viral
code...F-PROT was telling you the truth.

Subject: Technical Information in V-L (PC)

Recently a reader (no names) made the comment that there does not seem
to be much technical information posted on viruses other than
signature strings. IMHO that is definately a "bottom duck". In the
time that I have been active there has been a tremendous amount of
information published - a few of the author's of a-v products have
even told me that the information published was the inspiration for
their products.

Just from memory some of this included:

a) a simple matrix driven algorithm for computing checksums individualized
   to each PC.
b) how to block ANSI bombs including the exact offset (61h) in DOS
   5.0 ANSI.SYS of the byte to change.
c) BIOS source code for detection of every MBR replacing virus (seen recently
   in a commercial a-v product)
d) Full description of FDISK /MBR
e) Explicit removal instructions for the DIR-II
f) Explicit recovery instructions for the AIDS Trojan
g) Explicit recovery information for the MusicBug Virus (thought impossible
   for some time).

Further, several times in the past I have published a "suggested
reading" list mostly of books I have found at BookStop, Walden Books,
or B. Dalton's (plug) that, if studied with enthusiasm, would leave
the reader with a much better understanding of the architecture than
that of most virus writers. You'll even be able to spot all of the
mistakes in the "Little Black Book".

For that matter the best learning tool I know of comes free with DOS -
DEBUG.  Though generally I use MASM now even for MBR code, often the
first pass of a new program is done just with DEBUG - once the
principle is proven, I back it through SOURCER (plug) and use WordStar
and MASM thereafter (double plug).

Finally, there is the FAQ. Again IMHO if all the virus-writer-wannabes
would read the FAQ first they might give up before ever starting. As
has been said before, many, many times, There are only a limited
number of vulnerable points in a PC and if you block them and check
the blockers dynamically, the success rate for a virus goes waaaaay
down. It is only the fact that a PC has NO, Zip, Zero defenses as
delivered (well there are some BIOSes...) that encouraged viruses in
the first place.

In fact if the anti-virus writer is devious enough to plan ahead for
possible directed attacks and leave some easily detected holes
(remember Tim ?), eventually the virus writer will realize that there
really is a "home team advantage" after wasting a lot of time.

Then we get to the Network and a real chance to protect ourselves in
spite of the Turing problem since a client-server environment is a
dual-state machine that has capabilities beyond any single-state
machine. In fact a client-server environment is potentially stronger
than a 3090, VAX 9000, or even a Multics machine (emphasis on the
"potentially").

In short, please review the literature.

						Warmly,
							Padgett

No, you can never be absolutely sure.  The MtE is a set of linkable
modules.  Specifically, it links an independent random number
generator though one is provided.  You can't prove for modules not yet

Vesselin, this is obviously governed by 1) whether there's money at
stake and 2) whether you own one of those that manages 100% detection.

The idea right now regarding MtE is, because the files can't readily be
repaired, if someone is actually hit by MtE, they WILL require help.
And, as has been pointed out in a different posting, they call in the
big guns.  And the big guns bring along different tools, presumably tools
which will detect 100%.

Certainly it is better to have 100% than 99% than 50%.  There is no
debate there.  And 100% is always the goal.  But remember yet another
comment elsewhere, all this must be weighed against the common scenario
that an antivirus program is run most often in a virus-free environment
and must not be intrusive.

It is fair in an academic environment to compare the standalone MtE
detector with the full blown anti-virus package claiming to detect MtEs.
But it is not fair to make this comparison in a commercial environment
without a whole bunch of factors which are not covered (speed, size, ease
of use, ...).

Therein lies the debate.  There is no right or wrong.

The tests conducted by Vesselin on NAV 2.1 were based on a beta
version I had given him the first day of September.  We are attempting
to get the real product to him so he might be able to redo the tests
and update the results.  And I understand we are still not successful.
We'll keep trying.

I can confidently state that the shipped version of NAV 2.1 does far
better than the results he gathered from the beta version.  I might
jokingly say that the version we shipped detects 101% of MtEs (false
ids) for which a patch is now being distributed.

Anyway, the results are not representative of the shipped product.

If Vesselin responds to this posting, I hope he acknowledges that the
diskette I gave him is clearly labeled "NAV 2.1 beta 14" (the beta
being the symbol form).  And I do acknowledge he tested with the
latest version he had available.  :-)

While the wording is not quite equivalent, the end result would be the

If he had, it would be very likely that we would be sued or at least

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

                                         Contact:  William S. McKiernan
                                                   (408) 988-3832

    Dark Avenger Mutation Engine No Threat to Protected PCs

   Santa Clara, CA -- May 11, 1992 -- McAfee Associates confirmed today
that users of its suite of VIRUSCAN anti-virus products have nothing to
fear from the new generation of mutating or polymorphic viruses.

   McAfee Associates, the nation's leading anti-virus software company,
has been swamped with calls from concerned corporate PC users worried
about the threat of the so-called Dark Avenger Mutation Engine.
"Actually, we cracked this engine some months ago and have been shipping
product capable of detecting the Mutation Engine since March", said
William S. McKiernan, vice president, McAfee Associates.

   The Dark Avenger Mutation Engine, which first appeared on European
bulletin boards a few months ago, is a new kind of virus threat. In the
past, viruses such as the Jerusalem or the recent Michelangelo strain
had distinct, single identities that made them relatively easy to detect
and control. "The Mutation Engine, however, can be used by virtually
anyone to create a mutating virus which is very difficult to detect,"
said McKiernan. "The fact that it is widely available on bulletin boards
makes it that much more freightening."

   The Mutation Engine uses encryption techniques to avoid detection.
Before a virus can become active it needs to decrypt itself. Ordinarily
the code used for this decryption remains constant, allowing the use of
standard byte matching techniques for detection. The Mutation Engine,
however, uses a special algorithm to generate a completely variable
decryption routine each time. "The result is that no three bytes remain
constant from one sample to the next," said Igor Grebert, senior
programmer at McAfee Associates. "This makes detection using conventional
string-matching techniques impossible."

   VIRUSCAN, however, has no such problem. According to McKiernan, the
downloadable shareware contains a new generation of virus detection
algorithm capable of statistical and numerical analysis. It detects
the Mutation Engine by "sensing" its presence rather than by attempting
to actually spot it in a byte-for-byte string comparison. VIRUSCAN
consistently detected all iterations of the Mutation Engine in tests
done at McAfee, McKiernan said.

   Santa Clara-based McAfee Associates first received reports of the
Mutation Engine early this year. It is believed that the Engine is
a product of the Bulgarian virus creator responsible for the original
conventional Dark Avenger virus.

   Though some viruses using the Mutation Engine have already appeared
in the U.S., the engine is not expected to present a widespread problem
for some time, McKiernan said. Typically the McAfee "early warning"
network identifies new viruses months before they are a threat to the
U.S. market.

   Nevertheless, the PC world has reacted emotionally to the presence
of the Mutation Engine. "It is clear that the game is forever changed,"
said columnist Steve Gibson in a recent issue of the computer journal
InfoWorld. "The sophistication of the Mutation Engine is amazing and
staggering."

   The presence of the Mutation Engine on bulletin boards may be more
of a threat than the virus itself. "You no longer have to be particularly
clever or experienced to use it," said McKiernan. "Now if you have a
modem you can be in the virus business overnight and the potential for
proliferation is a sobering thought."

   McKiernan said that conventional viruses are turning up at a rate of
10 to 20 per week. "We expect that the Mutation Engine will increase this
problem exponentially for those with unprotected systems," he said.

It is not surprising that it does not disinfect the file properly when
SCAN cannot even identify it.  Freddy is NOT a Jerusalem variant.
Attempting to remove it with a Jerusalem-specific disinfection routine
is certain to produce some strange results to say the least.

To take one fundamental difference - Freddy appends itself to .COM

At first I need to tell, this NO FLAME. I'm just curios. Mr. Goretsky
wrote, that the number after the "V" tells how many viruses are found
by the version.  That seems somehow strange. Do you invent a new virus
in order to skip a versionnumber which was already used by a trojan?
Currently I assume, you just wait for the next virus to appear, then
add it to the update, and skip the trojan's number. Is this the right
way to see things ?

The amount of your free conventional memory is the problem. F-Prot
2.06a requires about 450 Kb free memory. When I am running DesqView, I
have about 350 Kb free memory in a DOS window. F-Prot is able to
detect that it might not be enough and outputs a warning. Obviously,
the 396 Kb of free memory that you have are not enough either, but
they are too close to the limit and the program does not detect that.

BTW, F-Prot is still able to work when there is not enough memory. I
mean, to work as a scanner, in command-line mode. The functions that
need a lot of memory are the heuristic analyzer and the virus help
database. So, if you are not using them, you should have no problems.

But I agree that not detecting the fact that the amount of free memory
is not enough is a bug and has to be fixed.

There are several possibilities.

The most reliable one is to write an 80286 emulator and to interpret
the decryptor of the virus, until it has decrypted itself, then use a
standard scanning technique on the decrypted virus body. As far as I
know, UTScan uses this, and also an anti-virus program, written by the
Russian anti-virus researcher Eugene Kaspersky. The drawbacks of this
method are that it tends to be slow.

Another methods is to use some kind of heuristics, in order to sieve
out those files that are obviously not infected and then apply careful
analysis on the rest. I believe that F-Prot and Dr. Solomon's
FindVirus do something like that, but I am not certain.

A third method is to write a finite automate that can recognize all
possible decryptors, generated by the MtE. It's rather difficult to do
it, since it requires a very detailed analysis of the MtE and deep
understanding of what it does. Furthermore, you have to combine this
method with a simple scan string search, in order to spot the
unencrypted replicants, because they don't have decryptors. I believe
that the MTE.AVR module for TbScan/HTScan by Frans Veldman does
something like that.

A fourth method is to look for the instruction in the decryptor that
actually performs the decryption. It is either a direct XOR, or the
xor function is performed in the registers (sometimes - using a
combination of NOT, NEG, etc.) and the result is MOVed at the
appropriate place. This is achieved with a relatively limited set of
addressing modes (unlike the V2P6Z, where almost all possible
addressing modes are used), so it's relatively easy to spot. The fact
that the decryptor always ends in a JNZ backwards helps to reduce the
false positives. The program CatchMtE does something like that.

A fifth method was told to me by Gary Watson (all my attempts to
contact him by e-mail failed). You could scan the first few bytes of
the files for a JNZ backwards (the decryptor seems to never exceed 161
bytes), make sure that no instruction before it jumps after it, then
modify this JNZ to an instruction that points to your own code, so
that you receive control on every decryption loop, and then execute
the code. This is extremely dangerous, because if the virus writer
knows that you are actually transferring control to his code, he could
do a lot of nasty things to you... Just interpreting the code (the
first method) is much safer.

There are certainly other methods to do it. If anybody knows something
that I have missed, it would be nice to see it described here. For
instance, I am interested which method exactly is used by the IBM
scanner - it detects the MtE-based viruses very reliably...

64 of the about 150 existing Amiga viruses are described in the
Amiga section of the Computer Virus Catalog, published by VTC-Hamburg.
It is free and can be obtained by anonymous ftp. Get the file

Wot?

Breaking the rules is par for the course under DOS. If it weren't then
we shouldn't have tools to sort directories, defrag discs and other
wonderful features every powerutility set's got these days.

Also, tunnelling viruses don't really display "virus like" behaviour.
Active monitors have their place, but as for "useful for all PCs" --
I sincerely doubt it.

Subject: source for tools

It's been stated many times in the past why source for scanners is
kept a deep secret.  Does the same thinking generally apply to
integrity checkers?  It occurs to me that a given integrity checker
should not rely on secrecy of its own checksumming algorithm, for
instance, for its "security" -- rather, algorithms should be freely
distributable [because someone will soon figure it out anyway!] and
the security mechanism should be based on some seed key which is
unique to a given system -- in short, a type of encryption technology
in which a virus would need to know the "key" to try to defeat the
integrity checking mechanism.

The related question, I suppose, is this: are there any integrity
checking packages floating around the net that include full source?
'Twould make *me* feel better about running it, anyway...

While this may be the case the CHRISTMA virus used a users nicknames
file to fi nd user ID's to send itself to. It stands to reason that
the majority of users will have nicknames for users who have nicknames
for them. Therefore ( if you f ollow the above ) any userwho sent on
the CHRISTMA virus would be bound to rec eive it again by return
whether it had erased itself or not.
