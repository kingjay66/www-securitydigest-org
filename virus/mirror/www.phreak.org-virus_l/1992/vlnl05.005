Subject: Virus Update disk for Central Point Antivirus (PC)

Does anyone know of an ftp site that carries the virus update file that
comes out quarterly from Central Point? I just got my first Virus Update
Bulletin and I can't afford to download this file through their BBS or
pay to get the Update Disk (another poor university student!!) and I
don't really want to type in all the hex codes.

Any help will be greatly appreciated!

IMHO, you've just been lucky, but not incredibly lucky.  "Stoned" will
only infect a hard drive if you boot from an infected floppy; however,
since you operate the PC in question with a batch program, it is
unlikely that you ever have the need (or take the opportunity) to boot
from a floppy.

Your hard disk's having the drive letter D: has nothing to do with the
"Stoned" virus' ability to infect it.  Drive letters are assigned by DOS,
but "Stoned" operates at a much lower level than DOS -- through the
disk interrupt, INT 13H.  At this level, all disks are specified by
a sequential number, according to drive type.  Floppy drive numbers start
at 00H and hard drive numbers start at 80H (numbers are hexadecimal).
For a system with one floppy and one hard disk, Drive A: is 00H and drive
C: is 80H.  For your system, Drive A: is 00H, Drive B: is 01H, Drive C:
is 02H, and Drive D: is 80H.  As you can see, the number of the first
hard drive, regardless of letter, is always 80H to INT 13H, and therefore
to "Stoned," which infects drive 80H via INT 13H.

You may want to consider installing VSHIELD or a comparable TSR anti-
virus package, in spite of the speed (or lack thereof) of your machine.
Or if speed really is a major concern, Padgett's NoFBoot will at least
prevent you from warm-booting with a floppy in drive A: (the cause of
hard disk "Stoned" infections).

BTW, listing the directory of a floppy disk is NOT "prime infection
activity," at least not in the sense of getting a virus FROM the floppy
TO the hard disk.  Now, if the machine was ALREADY infected, listing the
directory of a floppy (or any other floppy access) WOULD be "prime
infection activity" in the sense of getting a virus FROM the hard disk
TO the floppy.  With ANY virus (not just "Stoned"), the viral code must
be EXECUTED to infect a clean system, not just viewed.

Hope this is of some help.

European products in this domain will be recognized internationally.

For stoned to infect a hard disk, the computer must be booted from an
infected diskette.  It may be that in its current setup no student ever
reboots the computer from any diskette, because the computer has
only one function -- disk copying  -- and is always already on and 
ready to go.

Many of the diskettes being copied may be infected, but because the
copy station isn't started from these infected diskettes, the virus
doesn't get onto the station.  Nor is it transferred between the
diskettes during the file copying process.

Stoned is a problem in multi-use computer labs, where students reboot
the computers from diskettes, either because they are using copy-protected
games that must be booted from the diskette, or because they don't know
any better -- don't know how else to get to the task they want to run.  

I'm afraid I'm not a guru, and for all I know there may be something
about stoned's INT 13 hard disk reads and writes being set with DL=80h
rather than 81h, but I don't think so.  (Padgett?)  I would suspect the
above explanation in the case of a dedicated, one-use computer like
you describe.

The test is to intentionally boot the computer from an infected
floppy, then see if Stoned is on the hard drive.  This test is only to
be done if you know what you are doing, of course!

Tim.

If VSUM says that, it's wrong.   All you have to do is fix the master
boot record; the undocumented /MBR option to DOS 5's FDISK command
can do that (with the caveats noted in the last VIRUS-L), or your
local guru can do it with DEBUG, or you can use any of various
commercially-available utilities that I'm sure are out there!   *8)

While Mac antivir. pgms.  may scan your SoftPC hard disk file, they
are not designed to identify PC virii.  You can install a PC antivir.
program on your SoftPC drive (or keep it on a locked floppy).  I have
McAffe's SCAN and CLEAN installed on mine and they work fine.  Just
treat your SoftPC virtual hard drive the way you would treat any other
PC drive.

SoftPC also allows you to designate a Mac folder as your E: drive.
There may be problems trying to scan this folder from SoftPC because
it is not a real drive and doesn't have all of the normal structures
(no boot blocks for example)

Subject: a trojan horse - literally!

(from UK newspaper "Daily Telegraph", Mon 6 Jan 1992)
[Trojan horse workers trick factory guards]
A trojan horse used by protesting wheat farmers during President Bush's visit to
Australia was used by locked-out workers to slip back into a factory today.  The
13-foot horse, which was made up of metal drums had been used by farmers outside
Canberra's  Parliament  House on Thursday when the Americal President was in the
capital. It bore the sign: "Not a New World  Order,  a  New  Wheat  Order."  The
farmers  were  protesting  at United States grain subsidied that Australians say
undercut their crops in world markets.
Yesterday the horse found a different use  when  it  was  driven  on  a  trailer
through  the  gates  of  the  Bryant  Group  heavy transport firm which had been
repossessed by the Commonwealth Bank because of a mortgage dispute.  The  guards
left on the factory gate by the bank thought the horse was being returned to the
plant  after  being used in the demonstration. Then about 20 workers spilled out
of the horse and into the factory. The security guards  left  after  they  found
that  they were outnumbered by the workers. Police said that no charges would be
laid. Bank officials were not available for comment. "It's business  as  usual,"
said  Mr.Joe  Bryant,  managing director of the Bryant Group. "If we have to pay
the bank, we have to generate income, and we do that by working" - AP

Subject: Trojan definition? Special case

Hi,

I heard there was a collection for a FAQ list. Maybe this question
belongs to it: What is the exact definition for "trojan"?

I would like to present you a special case where I would say,
this is one, and I'm very interested in your opinion.

Some week ago, someone uploaded a program in a BBS where
anonymous uploading is possible. The program description given
had some attributes that were sufficient to make the program a
widely downloaded one. Keywords were: "sex","porno" et cetera...
To admit, the author did all not to say what the program really
was for.

What the program did: It asked the user to free 20MB of hard
disk space (if not already free), created a file with that length
fully filled with "6"es and stuffed it on the screen. This should
apparently be a joke since in German the words for "sex" and for
the number 6 are spoken the same way. So the program actually
intended no damage, but some users with small hard disks had
problems with Murphy's law when freeing the space (they deleted
files, you know).

The story still is not ended because the program writer later
claimed it to be a "scientific experiment"...

So, is this a trojan or not? Where is the border between "damaging"
and "not damaging"? Is it sufficient for a program to be a trojan
if it does not what it says or intends?

BTW: I know that the users are to blame for not maintaining some
security on their system, but that's not the point.

Thanks for answers   R Stephan

The January 1992 edition of the EDP Audit, Control, and Security
(EDPACS) newsletter includes an overview of an article that appeared
in the October 1991 Massachusettes Institute of Technology Review.
The Review reported that Software and Electrical Engineering (SEE) was
one of two organizations preparing reports for the Army Center for
Signal Warfare on the deliberate use of computer viruses and worms to
incapacitate computer networks.  The center identified the desired
effects of such a use as including data disruption, denial of use, and
affecting the operation of processors and the management of data
storage.  SEE's contract was reportedly for $50,000; however, it stood
to make as much as $500,000, according to this account, if it received
a contract for the follow-up phase of the project, which involves
devising particular viruses, demonstrating them, and devising possible
defenses against their use.

I am indebted to Padgett Peterson for reminding me of some

I think this one belongs with the users who can't find "Any"
keys, photocopy floppies and can't see whether the screen is on
because the power is off.

2) "CMOS" virus
3) "BIOS" virus
4) "Battery" virus
These three are all variations on a similar theme.  These types
of viri are reported regularly.

First of all, BIOS is ROM BIOS.  The RO in ROM stands for "read
only".  The BIOS, therefore, cannot be infected by a virus.  At
least, not yet.  Intel has already developed flash EEPROMs which
it is pushing as "upgradeable" ROMs for the BIOS.  It *is*
possible to get "bad" ROMs, and it is even possible that a run
of BIOS ROMs would be programmed such that they constantly
"release" a virus.  It hasn't yet happened, though, and it is
extremely unlikely, as well as being easy to trace.

The CMOS is stored in RAM, and can be changed.  However, the
CMOS table is stored in a very small piece of memory.  It is
highly unlikely that a virus could fit into the "leftover"
space, even though the theoretical limit of the "minimal" family
is about 31 bytes.  More importantly, in normal operation the
contents of the CMOS are never "run", but are referred to as
data by the operating system.

We have had "joke" reports of electrical "metaviri" (eg. "they
cluster around the negative terminal, so if you cut off the
negative post you should be safe ...", "they transmit over the
"third prong", but occasionally leak over onto the others ..."). 
However, there are also a number of reports that changing the
battery in a computer damages the CMOS.  This is probably
because no matter how fast you change the battery, there is a
loss of power during that time, and therefore the data is lost. 
Some computers do have a backup system that does give you about
10 minutes to change the battery, but by no means all.

Next week: the dreaded modem virus.
