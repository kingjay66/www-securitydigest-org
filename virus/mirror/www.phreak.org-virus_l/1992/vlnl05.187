Since the program is already out and in production, this is a moot
point.  What is important is that it be fixed, esp. before the virus
becomes more common.  In case a new virus does become widespread
between releases, we can always move a release date forward to get a
new version capable of detecting that particular virus out.

Igor is one of seven programmers working at McAfee Associates.
Although their duties are pretty much shared, there does tend to be
some job specialization on their part.  That's the reason I asked.

Subject: Bug in F-Prot2.06a (PC)

     I have also found that F-Prot2.06a will conk out on me when I try
to look at virus information.  The circumstances are somewhat complex,
so it's hardly a pure example, but other people seem to be having a
problem recreating it, so here it is:

     Using a 486/33 with 8 meg of ram, and using QEMM, I executed
XTreeGold 2.5 from within DESQView/X.  I then select F-Prot2.06a from
the command line within XTree (which now shows 405,744 bytes available
in convetional memory.)  After getting the F-Prot menu, I select
"Viruses," then "Information."  When I then select any virus, I find
myself out of F-Prot with the message "Out of Memory Error," and back
at the command line for XTree.  As I said, hardly a pure example...

     While I'm here I think the idea of putting non PC virus posts
first is a good one.  (That way they can avoid most of the bickering
that the rest of us must endure.) <sad grin>. I think it's funny,
though, that the same issue that suggests this idea ENDS with a post
asking if any of us know anything about Atari ST viruses! ;-)

hello, I am new here. I hope someone could give me some information
about the INVOLVE virus.  I know that it changes the date on the files
that it infects.  One thing I ran across that bothers me.  I deleted
all the files that SCAN reports and rescan the system with "No virus
found" message.  Then about a month after, close to the same date,
SCAN reported "INVOLVE virus found."  I have not load any new file to
the system during that one month period.  Any information wil be
greatly appreciated.

Subject: MODE.COM vs. DAME virus (PC)

We got a positive indication of the DAME virus on an old compaq dos disk.
mode.com is the only file identified.  It appears to have a length of about
4k or so.  Dame was not found in memory, just on this disk.  Dumping the
file with psa Dump utility, shows a batch of strings at offset c60..
"The compaq...version 3.1" etc.  The file ends at offset 1050.  This is
from a copy.  That is, I copied the mode.com off to dame.vir on the hard
disk.  The info I see on Dame indicates that it is a stealth virus, and 
adds about 3K to the file.  It appends it's self to the end of the file.
I have a hard time believeing that mode was less than 1K long, when offset
c60 has an obvious string that belongs there.  I presume that this is a
false positive?  Any comments?
Cheers

Subject: HELP!! Ever hear of this virus before? (PC)

I am hoping that this is not a truly dumb question.
I was running the unreal.demo for the fourth time when it stopped,
the screen went blank and two little red eyes appeared in the upper left
quadrant of my screen.  I erased the demo.  I ran the only (old) version
of winscan I had, it didn't report anything. I restored from backup tape.
I don't believe that the backup erased any files before restoring, so all of
the new files remained, it just replaced duplicate files. Bummer.   

I have the dos version of 'ls'.  Whenever I run 'dir' on the system disk, 
everything appears normal. However when I run 'ls' on the system disk,
two bizarre files show up at the end of the listing. They have the form
like:   chnsyz27asu   (not exactly that)  but no '.' and they change
every time I do the 'ls'.

Now what the $#!@& did I catch?????????    Anybody ever run into this???

There is no problem.  This situation has to do with the Novell
drivers, and is not related to VIRSTOP.  There is a text string
"problem with" at the point in memory where the program names are
expected to be found.

This is because most of the entries in VSUM are incorrect somewhere.
It is decent for a quick generalization about a virus, but is not at
all near correct for all viruses it mentions.

Patricia Hoffman doesn't have the viruses she writes about, and gets
most of her information from McAfee Associates.  And, since we already
know that (as Vess has pointed out...) most of the info in VIRLIST.TXT
isn't accurate, neither is the info in VSUM.

Seems to be around 95% PC folk, 4% MAC, and 1% everybody else.

I haven't even used an ST or looked at any Atari viruses, however you seem
to be lacking much response, so I'll give it a go!

Basically the Atari ST is a copy of the IBM PC, but using 68000 processor.
It uses similar disk formats, and TOS copies most of the functions used
by DR/MS/PC-DOS.  The inclusion of GEM in ROM makes writing GUI and graphics
programs a lot easier than for IBM compatibles.

Rather than the COM and EXE program types on a PC the ST has several
different ones:
    .PRG    a program using GEM support
    .TOS    a program that disables GEM while running
    .TTP    as TOS, but if executed from GEM a dialogue box will
            open to take program parameters (eg a filename for an editor)
    .ACC    'accessories', programs permanently loaded by GEM (eg calendars,
            calculators, etc..)

ST viruses operate similarly to a PC: infecting disk boot sectors; or
executable files of one or more of the types listed.


Previously you asked, without reply:
> On the Atari ST a bootsector has to have a checksum of $1234, if it is

True.

Perhaps it loads as an accessory, by modifying the start up script (sorry,
I can't remember what it is called - equivalent to AUTOEXEC.BAT for MS-DOS).

Subject: What is this "AV BBS list" nonsense? (general)

I have been asked to explain where the antiviral BBS listings come
from, and how it is compiled.  Fair question.

Basically, someone wanted an AV BBS list, so I thought I'd give it a
try.  Most of the listings come from info I can glean from postings to
the Fidonet virus related echoes.  Now that I have "seeded" the list,
I am also getting info from people who want to get on the list.  (I
try to note which boards do "virus exchange" and exclude them.)  I
have included BBS numbers from commercial software houses that produce
antiviral software as well.  Thus the listings come from a variety of
sources, and while I try to do some weeding, I can't vouch for
everything on the list.  I appreciate all additions and corrections.

Eventually I hope that I will be able to start "reviewing" the boards
as well.  One group has asked for that sort of thing, but they aren't
ready to start funding it yet.  When that happens, I will be better
able to "standardize" the listings, which are pretty ragged at the
moment.  I have tried to include, where I have any information, the
"system" bias of the BBS, as well as the Fidonet or VirNet "echoes"
(discussion groups) that the board carries.

Part of the purpose of the list is to direct those on the Internet and
want an entre into the local BBS community.  A very specific purpose
was to find a board in the Edmonton area.  This must be considered a
complete failure: despite numerous requests, I still have no listing
within a 200 km radius of Edmonton.  :-)

Well, I was not on vacation when this happened.

I do remember some of the backbones of VNET being taken offline
briefly while it did a purge of CHRISTMA EXECs.  And then, the daemons
were put in place and that was the end of that.  (Certainly, the
daemons could not have been distributed if the network was down.)  It
didn't take more than one morning for everything to hype up and cool
down.

So, VNET was not shut down as a whole.  Messages sometimes were just a
little slower getting there that morning.  People who were uninvolved
probably didn't notice much (except for the sysadmin's mail
admonishing people from running EXECs without reading them) since
worse delays could be caused by controlled downtime due to "lightning
in the area."

It is my firm belief that magnitudes more of mail traffic occurred
talking about this than occurred from the actual problem.

No it is certainly not the end, there are a great many other tools yet
to appear.  Of course people must be convinced of the need for other
tools before they can be produced, (ie sold).  The tools currently
used give a range of protection:

SCANNERS
Require:    (detailed) knowledge of specific viruses.
Result:     recognise known viruses in files, and some variants.
Usage:      resident or (usually) interactive.
Failings:   may miss viruses if knowledge is incorrect, may give false
            alarms for innocent programs.
Purpose:    vetting programs before use or distribution.


INTEGRITY TOOLS:
Require:    general knowledge of viruses, and how they may attempt to
            deceive integrity tools.
Result:     detect changes [or attempted changes] to system.
Usage:      interactive - check summers, etc...,
            [resident - integrity shells, etc... ].
Failings:   alarm on normal system activities, check summers only warn -after-
            virus activity has occurred and must be used frequently for
            timely warnings.  Cumbersome.
Purpose:    sentry system for desktop PCs, (can be difficult to manage over
            networks), not useful for 'public' PCs or those without a local
            techie to provide support.


ACTIVE MONITORS:
Require:    some detailed knowledge of viruses.
Result:     detect 'virus like' behaviour.
Usage:      resident.
Failings:   may not recognise new viruses.
Purpose:    sentry system, useful for all PCs - very few false alarms


HEURISTICS: rule based extensions to any class of tool.


OTHERS:     well, I hope to show you all some of my ideas early in the new
            year.

This is certainly the impression given by most producers of a-v tools.

I'm not announcing any new techniques till I've got product(s) ready that

More generally, a-v tool producers don't want to loose their 'unique
selling points' that make them better than the competition.
Also -detailed- description of techniques is only useful to 2 groups of
people: a-v producers and virus writers.  While I am happy to discuss
approaches used and some of the considerations applied in a public forum,
(ie here), I want to keep details of a-v operations as far away from virus
writers as possible.  I know that other responsible a-v producers feel
the same.

There is no "conspiracy of silence", just a realisation that the virus
problem will worsen faster if particular product implementations are
disclosed publicly.  Few companies put a notice on the front door saying
when the wages will be delivered, this is just a sensible degree of caution.

If you wish to discuss the relative merits of different a-v approaches, or
the philosophies of the producers of a-v tools, or the principles of
operation for classes of tool, then these are entirely appropriate for
this forum.  I am sure you would draw out a wide range of views on any
of these topics.

Hope this helps,

Subject: Mr. Slade's listings

I am constantly amazed that ASP has not yet made Mr. Slade's lists.
We have been in the antivirus business since 1986, and yet the list
has hundreds of products/services/research groups/BBSs/etc. that have
been in existence for far less time, and with a very broad range of
different expertise.  I simply cannot believe that Mr. Slade is not
aware of the existence of ASP.

	And then we have the hundreds of bug reports and fixes posted
about various products on Virus-L.  Why is this?  Don't these companies
deal with their customers over the phone?  Or is it just PR to keep
their names in front of the Virus-L public all the time?

	I wish Virus-L's moderator would make a defined policy about
what goes on V-L and stick to it.  I could use the daily plug for my
products and services too, and yet we don't see all that much PR from
many of the companies that have products, only a small number that seem
to be in the Virus-L elite.

	By the way, Today, ASP created over 1500 new viruses (using our
automated program evolution system), and NONE of the scanners listed as
the best around detected ANY OF THEM!  That means that the current
detection rate of the best scanners in the world is only 50\%, and in 
another few days, we could knock their detection rates down to under 10\%
without much effort!  When will we start to see analysis based on the
likelihood of getting a virus not detected by a particular scanner?

	Example:  (taken from Jon David's original example several years
ago - with modifications)

	Virus 123 represents 0.12\% of reported incidents
	Product X detects Virus 123
	=> Product X gets 0.12\%age point toward a 100\% rating
		of REAL WORLD EFFICACY!

	If you want a second (and far less important) rating scale, you
might include a rating of detection against the CARO list (or some such
other thing) with weightings associated with the age of a virus in the
CARO list.  Hence you get worse ratings for not detecting older viruses
which are more likely to have spread further.

	And then we have the problem of fair evaluations.  I don't see
how it is unfair to report any evaluation as long as you provide the
details about the testing methods used to determine the results and let
others respond to them.  Perhaps V-L should ONLY publish ratings under
the proviso that the details of the tests are provided with them!

	Well, that's my view of it all.  I figure I'll get plenty of
grief for having posted it (if it indeed gets posted), so don't bother to
complain directly to me - this is the sort of discussion we should have
on Virus-L in front of the whole world.

Subject: MtE detection tests (part 3/5) (PC)

Hello, everybody!

Here is the long awaited report about the MtE detection tests that we
performed at VTC-Hamburg.  It is rather longish, so maybe Ken should
consider splitting it into parts.  Normally, I should have put it for
anonymous ftp, instead of publishing it here, but the preliminary
results of the tests raised enough interest and discussions, so I
decided to publish it in a whole in this newsgroup.  Nevertheless, it
- - -is- available for anonymous ftp as

ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de:pub/virus/texts/tests/mtetests.zip

[Moderator's note: The complete text of Vesselin's MtE tests are also
available from:
      cert.org:pub/virus-l/docs/mtetests.zip 
As I had previously indicated, I have broken Vesselin's tests down
into five parts and will post each seperately.]

Enjoy.  Comments, questions, and suggestions are welcome.

Regards,
Vesselin

3. The scanners.

The following scanners were used in the tests. For each scanner we are
indicating its full name, its version, the company that produces it,
its status (commercial or shareware), and its codename, which will be
used for short in the report of the results.

We did our best to test all scanners that claimed to detect the
MtE-based viruses and to use the latest versions of them. Of course,
it is possible that we failed to do so - most of the scanners are
commercial and we are just not able to always aquire the latest
versions of all commercial anti-virus products.

If we made a mistake - i.e., if a newer, fixed version of some of the
scanners is available, which is supposed to show better results, or if
there are other scanners that are able to detect the MtE-based
viruses, or if I have failed to indicate some essential information
(e.g., the date of the drivers that the particular scanners uses), we
would like to hear about it. If a newer and better version of any of
the products listed here is supplied to us, we are ready to repeat the
tests for it and to publish the results.

order of their codenames.

Subject: McAfee VIRUSCAN V99 uploaded to SIMTEL20 (PC)

I have uploaded to WSMR-SIMTEL20.Army.Mil:

pd1:<msdos.trojan-pro>
NETSC99B.ZIP    NETSCAN 99-B checks file servers for viruses
SCANV99.ZIP     VIRUSCAN V99 checks PC's for viruses


WHAT'S NEW

     Version 99 of the VIRUSCAN and NETSCAN programs adds detection of
90 new viruses, bringing the total to 865 viruses, 1561 variants.
Version 98 was skipped because of a report of a Trojan horse from San
Francisco, Calif.

     A new Dark Avenger Mutation Engine (DAME or MtE) detector has
been added in this realese.  This detector is different from the
previous version and should offer a higher rate of detection as well
as greatly reduce the number of false alarms.

     A new switch, /AD, has been added to VIRUSCAN.  When run with this
switch, SCAN checks all local volumes (drives).  No drives need to be
specified when run with SCAN is run with this switch.  (Thanks for Martin
Kiff for the suggestion!)

     SCAN no longer stops and displays an error message if an attempt is
made to check a non-existant drive.  Instead, it will display an error
message and continue to the next drive.

     NETSCAN Version 99-B replaces Version 99, which wouldn't scan some
network drives.  Version 99 was not released on the Internet.

     VSHIELD and CLEAN-UP are in beta-test and will be available later
this week or early next week, barring any unforseen problems.  WSCAN will
be slightly delayed since Spencer Clark, our Windows programmer, just had
a baby (more precisely, his wife did... :-).  Congratulations to the Clark's
on the birth of their son.
