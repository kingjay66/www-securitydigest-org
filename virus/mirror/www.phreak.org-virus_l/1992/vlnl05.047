The mystery of the .BAT file contents tightly prepended to the front
of WP.EXE, and the other corrupted non-executable files, seems to be
solved (thanks again, cgordon in Chicago!).  The phenomenon could
easily have been caused by a defragmentation program that squeezes the
contents of files and later writes them back to newly freed clusters,
being interrupted prematurely.  (Hence the filename, etc., being
packed with their contents).

No, Steve, CHKDSK found no problem (which is a surprise if a defragger
left corruption when it got interrupted).

Subject: Scan False Alarm (PC)

I have a problem with a false virus alert (15xx) to be exact from
MacFee's Scan V8.3B86.  The program claims the virus is in memory.
When the /M option is used to check memory for all virii.  I know that
there is no virus present.  (If anyone's interested I can explain how
I know this but it's a bit superfluous to my question.)

Problem History.

The virus warning occured on two machines in a lab of 15 PS2 model 30s.
Each machine is of standard configuration but with a Western Digitial 8
bit ethernet card in them.  In the lab we use a technique called
Rebuilding to keep a constant software set on the machines.  This works
by letting each machine, when reset, to logon to a server which contains
a software backup set and copying any files which differ on the remote
machine, from the file server to the remote machine.

I have used Macfee's latest version of Netscan to check the network and
it reports no virii.

The two PS2s in question both report a 15xx virus in memory but not on
any files.  Clean 8.1v85 fails to spot or remove the virus and running
scan without the /M option stops the error report.  Findvirus from
Solomon's does not find the virus.

The only way that these two machines differ from the other fifteen is
that they did have multiple partitions under Dos 3.3 and when I upgraded
them to dos 5 I used fdisk on dos 5 to remove these partitions.  Could
this be the problem? Should I have used Dos 3.3 fdisk? I would low-level
format these machines but no-one seems to know how to access the
facility on a PS2 model thirty.

Is there a problem with Scan.  I am positive that the virus alert is a
false alarm.

It would seem impossible for a virus to do anything intelligent to a
non-existant hard disk unless the virus was constructed specifically
to do something damaging to one of the basic drive types - like
4-615-17 (hd-cyl-sect).

Can't you stuff commands past the bios even if the drive isn't set in cmos?

My guess is that the computer will crash, the NetWare won't be loaded
and probably some of the vital system information on the server will
be destroyed. Recovering it might be possible, but will require -very-
qualified help. And, of course, if you try to do this on March 6, the
server's disk will be overwritten - just as any other IBM PC
compatible disk.

That's right, but:

1) Sometimes SYS A: will simply not work (because of an older DOS
version, which does not permit the two hidded files to be anywhere on
the disk; or because there is simply no room on the floppy for the two
DOS hidden files).

2) Designing a generic bootable boot sector is -very- difficult, I
would say near to impossible. The boot sectors of the different DOS
versions are different and in general incompatible between themselves.
And there are some really weird boot programs. For instance, the boot
loader of DR-DOS occupies 2 sectors... No, I don't believe that it is
possible to write a generic bootable boot sector... Instead,
IBM/Microsoft should include a special option in the SYS command -
just like FDISK /MBR overwrites the master boot sector, the SYS /BOOT
or something similar should replace the boot sector -only-, without
trying to put the two hidden files.

Won't a system reset which goes throught the POST overwrite all the
memory during the testing?  Wouldn't this eradicate the virus from
memory.  I'm refering to hitting the "RESET" button.  Doesn't hitting
the reset button inititate a COLD BOOT?  I prefer to hit RESET so I
don't have to wait for the hard disk to spin down after turning the
power off (beleiving that I need to wait to avoid a head crash).

Wait a minute! Do you mean that SCAN reported Joshi and F-Prot - SBC?
This might mean that you either have two viruses, or one of the
scanners gives a false positive... Joshi infects the master boot
sector of the hard disk, while SBC is a file infector. Where was the
virus reported? Which version of SCAN did you use - 86 or 86b?
Because, 86b is able to recognize SBC, if I recall correctly... The
virus is pretty new, so no wonder that F-Prot does not remove it
yet... Or, wait, maybe you mean SVC? It has several variants, some of
which infect both files and master boot sectors...

Ah, damn't, of course! How could I miss this... Silly me... :-) Thanks
for cleaning this up, Dave. Since the virus checks just for 360 Kb
diskettes and infects everything that does not have this format in a
particular way, without any further checks, I couldn't understand why
it should avoid 720 Kb diskettes...

In fact, this seems to depend very much on the computer type... I
received a report from somebody, who said that the virus infects 1.44
Mb diskettes, but they become unreadable. However, they could be still
read on the infected computer... This confused me, since the virus has
no stealth capabilities. I asked him for a copy of the boot sector and
actually installed it on my machine (PS/2 Model 50Z) and tried to
infect a diskette. (I -very- much dislike such kinds of experiments
and always prefer to disassemble the virus.) It infected a 1.44 Mb
diskette without problems... I tried it on another computer, and it
was perfectly readable!... :-)

   I've noticed various folks  talking about bulk magnetic erasers,  and
they're fine if you happen to have one handy.   But I picked up a floppy
zapper at a trade show that's the cheapest one around  (free,  that is):
it's just a refrigerator magnet  (one of those thick, flexible jobbies).
One slow scrub up & down, then left & right, and presto!  Those annoying
little magnetic particles  have been thoroughly confused.   The key here
is that it's the rate of change,  not the field strength,  that destroys
the magnetic  orientation  on the media,  and the magnetic  gradients on
your typical "rubber"  magnet are incredible.   I've rendered both 3.5"s
and 4.25"s  unreadable  by any of the  machines to  which I have access.
And I _always_  zap my floppies before I throw them out  (one experience
reading an "unreadable" floppy was plenty)!   I've learned to respect my
freebee floppy zapper's power  --  I keep it  'way at the top of a steel
doorframe (more than a meter from any floppy as it's carried through the
doorway).

I agree, of course. You are right. Furthermore, the virus can even
activate its destructive payload if you just press Alt-Ctrl-Del. For
instance, if you do this while the Jerusalem.AntiCAD.4096.Mozart virus
is playing its tune, it will overwrite the beginning of the hard disk.

I perfectly agree with the above statement. SOME viruses are indeed
able to survive the Ctrl-Alt-Del SOMETIMES.

We are having a lot of requests to eliminate TIME virus from several
machines (PCs).
    A vendor and us started investigating about it in our organization and
found some strange facts (we used an antivirus called anti-kot that he
brought):
- - first we found out that not only com files were infected but text files
did also.
- - we found a machine with no infected file except symbol files from Harvard
Graphics (this computer did not have problems while working)
- - not all of the com files that we ran in a computer that was supposelly
infected, got infected.
- - and similars.
   So, what would you think?  Is it the anti-kot program or is it that this
virus doesn't really exist?  In any case, what damage can it cause?

Yes, it can get infected. What will happen? Probably, NetWare will be
corrupted, since it's a different operating system from DOS, and wherever
the virus copies the original boot sector will probably not be unused.

Scan your floppy first. It's easier than reinstalling your server.

Can we define "boot a Novell network"?

If you boot a workstation from an infected disk, the workstation will
become infected.  The infection on the workstation will not "travel"
to the server, at least not over the network.  Since the infected
workstation will be churning out infected diskettes, it may well
travel around the office on "sneaker net".

If you boot the server from an infected diskette, the server disk will
become infected.  What happens then depends upon the server.  If the
server uses the proprietary Novell disk format, the disk may fail due
to the non-standard format (as is the case with UNIX and some OS/2
disks).  If the server uses a standard DOS/FAT format, the server will
become infected, and operate as per any normally infected DOS machine.
The possibility of infection of the network is the same as for a
workstation.

Subject: Timescar (Mac)

My FilemakerPro is running very slow and crashing seemingly at random.
A coworker's wife has discovered a virus at her work on her filemaker
pro called "timescar", which she located with a program called
"rad-x".

Had anybody heard anything about either the supposed virus of it's
supposed cure? They are both becoming my personal bigfoots. (bigfeet?)
S.A.M. say's nothing is wrong with my mac. Disenfectant finds nothing
either.  (That's disenfectant 2.6 - I thought it may be that wbdef
whatever...)

As always, any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks

Wildstar

Well, there will be a FAQ shortly.  (We *believe* there will be a FAQ!  :-)

[Moderator's note: There will indeed be a FAQ sheet shortly.  A first
draft went out to volunteers today.  Soon, real soon...]

For further information, there is a series of "one page" articles from
a weekly column published here.  (Actually, the author is terribly
behind at the moment, and soon Ken will having to be dealing with a
flood of catch-up material but ...)  The articles are archived at
cert.sei.cmu.edu (192.88.209.5) for ftp from the directory:
