Subject: Vshield vs Virstop (PC)

Hi All! I have a small question, Which antivirus TSR would you
recommend me to use? Vshield or Virstop? I have seen them both but the
big difference is the memory used by them...Which one has better
performance catching viruses? Virstop seems awfully small to have all
those signatures inside itself, as opposed to Vshield which is big and
(probably) has all the signatures inside. I don't have memory
constraints but the smaller the better as long as it performs
well...Anyone has any scan benchmarks done on these 2 programs? I
would to see some suggestions...Thanks! :-)

Hello,

We have a mild problem here. Scan v97b detected the [Filler] virus with
the command line:
	scan c: /chkhi
The program instructed us to power down and then reboot with a floppy.
We did this but then we could not detect the virus again. This of course
meant that Clean failed.

We opened some applications and then closed them. After trying scan again,
the virus reappeared.

Next we tried f-prot v206a and it told us that we had a possible Stoned
virus. wouldn't run unless we bypassed the memory check. Any clean
attempts failed here too.

Does anyone out there know how we can get rid of the [Filler] virus? 
ANY help would be appreciated.

Well, you are probably referring to the Pakistani Brain virus (ashar
brain, whatever you wanna call it).  It is a VERY old boot sector
infector (some of the newer varients can infect the MBR).  This means
they infect disks, and not files.  It uses some steath techniques, so
that it hides the it's infection by redirecting calls to read in the
boot sector to the location of the real boot sector, while in memory.

I supose you could say a normal virus wouldn't do that.

Luca Parisi asks about a leftover string "Carmel" plus other oddities

It is my understanding that the Central Point Anti-Virus program was
originally obtained from a company called "Carmel" in Isreal with 
an interesting background. I *suspect* this is the source.

If you look in the file AGENTS.TXT that comes with the SCAN suite,
you'll get a surprise! It turns out that International Data Security
is an official agent of McAfee Associates... Maybe when you see that,
you won't be that much surprised by the published results... I guess
that the message in Newsbytes did not say that it is a publicity, did
it?

Me? What about me? I have several times complained in this forum that
McAfee's agents are misusing our results for incorrect advertising...
This has happened four or five times... McAfee Associates always have
a nice excuse about it... You should ask them, not me...

Versions 20 and below of the scanner (UTScan) are very bad. Versions
23 (the latest one is 25, I think) are good enough. Remember - the
scanner is not the main feature of the package. It is used mainly
during the installation, to ensure that the main part - the integrity
checker - is installed on a virus-free system.

> Any comments on this package would be appreciated as I have some

The main feature of the package is its off-line integrity checker. It
is one of the best in its category - secure, fast, unobtrusive, easy
to use and with a nice user interface. Very few of the integrity
packages I know are as secure as it... Off the top of my head, I can
recall only Fred Cohen's ASP Integrity Toolkit, but it belongs to a
different class, since it is a resident integrity checker.

Another thing that the authors of Untouchable are very proud of, is
its ability to do "generic disinfection", i.e. to disinfect an unknown
virus. The disinfection is based on some information about the
uninfected file, stored in a database and on some heuristic rules
(that's why I prefer to call it "heuristic disinfection").

One important thing to have in mind is that the product is very good,
but not as good as the advertisements are trying to suggest you. Some
advertisements (in France) say that it is "the absolute weapon against
computer viruses" and that no virus, even an unknown one, is able to
bypass it. This is not true; even some of the known one do. For
instance, the integrity checker will not detect the replication of
Brain (because it infects only floppies) or of Darth Vader (because it
infects only on modification).

Other ads say that "it guarantees 100% disinfection of the infected
files". Don't be fooled to think that this means that 100% of the
infected files can be disinfected. It doesn't. What it means is that
if the product happens to disinfect a file, it guarantees that the
file is 100% restored to its original state (which is not that bad;
most of the current disinfectors cannot achieve this even with
Jerusalem). There are about 17 ways a virus can infect a file, and the
generic disinfector can handle about one third of them. The authors
have promised to achieve about two thirds soon. (Some viruses just
cannot be disinfected heuristically.)

As far as I know, the authors are working on a very powerful virus
description language (e.g., they can easily write an MtE detector in
it). I am not aware whether this language is already available in the
commercial versions of the product.

There are two features that would definitively improve the product. The
first one is a resident integrity checker, compatible with the current
off-line one. The second feature is true generic virus removal, the
kind of thing that is provided by TbClean from the ThunderByte
Anti-Virus package. This is a very nice idea and I would really like
to see it more widely used... Well, maybe some kind of monitoring
program will be useful too (they already have a resident scanner),
regardless that such programs are usually trivial to bypass...

Obviously, one of your requirements is that the integrity checker must
be resident (i.e., to be an integrity shell), otherwise you would
probably have mentioned Untouchable... Also, I have not seen the first
two product, but don't think that Virus Buster's integrity checker is
secure enough... VDS is also a robust system, but unfortunately it
is not compatible with user-installable volumes like Stacker...

Not that I disagree with you - integrity checking is indeed a much
stronger line of anti-virus defense than known-virus scanning.
However, it also has its place... For instance, before installing an
integrity checker, you must ensure that you are installing it on a
virus-free system, otherwise you might get some bad surprises...
Currently, the only known way to do that is to -scan- the system
before installation...

Furthermore, when the "something detector" detects that "something has
changed", you still need a program that tells you -what- has caused
the changes (hey, it might format the disk after 30 seconds!). You
also need a way to detect all infected files. Integrity checking
helps, but it cannot always determine the source of the infection.
And, if you cannot find it, you are running the risk to get infected
again...

At last, the examples used by you are not very correct. MtE and
Commander Bomber are attacks against known-virus scanning, not against
integrity checking. Is it surprising then that they defeat the
scanners and not the integrity checkers? How about that: worried that
your integrity checker cannot detect Brain, or Darth Vader, or fails
to detect the replication of StarShip, if it is already present in the
system? No problem, get a recent scanner/remover - it will identify
the infected files/diskettes and will remove the virus... :-)

Yes, the multi-layered approach is the best solution. But you still
need a known-virus scanner as one of the levels. Not a very strong
level, but a necessary one...

Unfortunately, it also takes about 50 bytes to locate these 20 bytes
and to change them to "do nothing" or "shut up"... :-)

Otherwise, no disagreement with your main points...

Seems to me that by removing the "feature" that allowed SCAN 97 to
work on networked drives, McAfee Associates have removed a bit too
much... :-) Just kidding, of course, but those two things might be
indeed related...

Hi
	Some people at the institution where i work believe it is impossible
 for an IBM mainframe 43xx series computer to become infected by any kind
 of virus, due to the unique operating system setup at each site.

	I believe otherwise,

	If you have known of a case that a definite virus has been discovered
 in a similar class machine, please e-mail me the details, as i would greatly
 appreciate it.

	Thank you

                    CHRISTMA - "Trusted" source
 
Commentary prompted by the CHRISTMA EXEC ranged over many topics. 
One subject was that of the "trusted source".  That is, that you
only run a program when you "know where it's been".  This is a good
principle for data security in general, but it is interesting that
it came up in discussion of this particular outbreak, since the
messages, after the initial spread, would have all come from
"known", and presumably trusted, sources.
 
Also interesting, in view of the fact that the EXEC actually
contained the source code, was the "opinion piece" which suggested
that only source code should be trusted.  This piece seems to have
been written by someone firmly settled, not only into the UNIX
community, but also into the UNIX culture.  It states that there is
no reason for not having the source code for everything you run. 
The author further asserts that there is no reason for software
producers and publishers not to give you the source code to every
program you buy.  (One can only surmise that he was a tad frustrated
at having to deal with some piece of commercial software.  One can
also surmise that he wasn't, himself, a software producer or
publisher.  :-)
 
However, most interesting of all was that this latter poster had
included an error in his posting, and thus killed his own argument
almost as soon as he made it.
 
(You can check this out.  I think it is one of the most amusing
threads in the whole archives of virus research.)
 
The first article appeared in Issue 6, number 2 of the RISKS-FORUM
Digest, Monday, January 4th, 1988.  (Another mistake was made in
that number: PGN had included the year 1987 in the masthead.)  The
posting is not exactly fanatical, but certainly strident, and
includes the "adage", "IF YOU CAN'T READ IT, DON'T RUN IT".  It also
contains the statement that testing unknown programs on "write-only
harddisks" is useless.
 
Well, I'd agree.  In fact, I'd say a "write-only harddisk" was a
pretty useless piece of equipment.  However, two further
respondents, the next day, quoted that exact passage (one defending
the thesis, one attacking it), without commenting on the error.  It
wasn't until a few days later that another posting pointed this out.
 
It also pointed out that the original poster did not catch this
error in the three paragraph "source"; that two further authors
quoted the error without noting it; and that the moderator, known
for his love of pun-laden editorial comment, missed it all three
times.  Obviously, the ability to catch a loophole hidden in several
thousand lines of source code is not a defense.
