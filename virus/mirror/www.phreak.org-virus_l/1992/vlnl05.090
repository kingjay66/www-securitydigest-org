		    New Macintosh Virus Discovered
			    17 April 1992

Virus: CODE 252
Damage: some, possibly severe (see text)
Spread: unknown (see text)
Systems affected: Apple Macintosh computers. All types, but see text.

A new virus, which has been designated "CODE 252", has been discovered
on Apple Macintosh computer systems. This virus is designed to trigger
if an infected application is run or system booted between June 6 and
December 31, inclusive.  When triggered, the virus brings up a dialog
box with the message:
   You have a virus.
   Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha
   Now erasing all disks...
   Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha
   P.S. Have a nice day.
   Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha
   (Click to continue...)

Despite this message, no files or directories are deleted in the
versions of the virus we have seen; however, a worried user might
power down the system upon seeing the message, and thus corrupt the
disk -- this could lead to significant damage.  Furthermore, the virus
may interact with some applications in such a manner as to damage
them.

Under System 7, the System file can be seriously damaged by the virus
under at least some circumstances as the virus attempts to spread.
This may lead to a system that will not boot, crashes, or other
unusual behavior.

Between January 1 and June 5, inclusive, the virus simply spreads from
applications to system files, and then on to other application files.
At the present moment, we have no indication that the virus causes
direct damage to any existing applications.

The virus does not spread to other applications under MultiFinder on
System 6.x systems, nor will it spread under System 7.  However, it
will run on those systems if an infected application is executed.
Even if you are running one of these systems, we recommend you obtain
an use one of latest versions of appropriate anti-virus software.

As of the date of this announcement (17 April 92), we have had limited
reported sightings of this virus.  This, combined with the nature of
operation of the virus, leads us to believe that the virus is not yet
widespread.

The current versions of Gatekeeper and SAM Intercept (in advanced and
custom mode) are effective against this virus.  Either program should
generate an alert if the virus is present and attempts to spread to
other files.  The Virex Record/Scan feature will also detect the virus.


Authors of all major Macintosh anti-virus tools are planning updates
to their tools to locate and/or eliminate this virus. Some of these
are listed below. We recommend that you obtain and run a CURRENT
version of AT LEAST ONE of these programs.

Some specific information on updated Mac anti-virus products follows:

    Comments:
    Gatekeeper should find this virus if it attempts to infect your
    system or applications, and thus does not need an update.
    Gatekeeper Aid will need an update to "know" exactly what virus it
    is seeing so it can remove the virus, but the update is not
    crucial for continued protection.  As Gatekeeper is freeware and
    Chris has a "real" life, this update may not be immediate.

From:    Werner Uhrig <werner@rascal.ics.utexas.edu>
Subject: CODE 252 - urgent new virus warning. (Mac)

	a new Macintosh virus has been "caught" and "dissected",
	and was given the name "CODE 252".

	a more detailed announcement about it and anti-viral updates
	will follow shortly.

	updates for all the anti-virals are in the pipeline and
	most will be released later today.

	Whereas the initial analysis of the virus did not indicate
	that its structure was cause for (great) alarm, it has
	now been confirmed to me that its (mis)behavior may well
	be the cause of a lot of trouble reports I have seen lately,
	which seem to indicate corrupted System files.

	The virus makes an attempt to bypass the SAM protection,
	but is not succesful in a majority of cases, but rather
	will set off SAM's alarms (so if SAM-users have seen
	new alerts lately, you may have been "visited")
	It infects both Applications and the System file, and
	it is in the infection of the System file that it can
	corrupt it in a way that can cause crashes, either at
	boot up or later.  If you have seen such happening lately,
	it is a possibility that you have to replace your System
	file (if you do not know about such things in some detail,
	you may have to reinstall from distribution floppies).

	The only anti-viral which will reliably stop it from spreading
	AT THIS TIME (until updates are announced) is GateKeeper, and
	I recommend at this time that anyone with problems should
	install the latest version of GateKeeper (Vn 1.5.1+) *NOW*
	(it was just recently distributed in comp.binaries.mac and
	is FTPable from RASCAL.ICS.UTEXAS.EDU in binary format, in
	the directory mac/virus-catchers, and in binhex format from
	MICROLIB.CC.UTEXAS.EDU in the directory microlib/mac/virus;
	many other FTPable sites also have it available)

	Given that GateKeeper reports not only all KNOWN viruses,
	but ALSO (what it considers) SUSPICIOUS BEHAVIOR, be advised
	(read the docs) that GateKeeper may complain about some
	activity on your computer which is permissable (and until
	you have recognized those in YOUR particular environment,
	you may have to add some things to the GateKeeper permissions
	list, to avoid warnings which are not caused by a virus
	infection)

	If, like me, you normally keep GateKeeper installed always
	in NOTIFY-ONLY mode, you probably would have also already
	noticed (and acted upon) any reported attempts to modify
	the System file (which is the ONE indicator that everyone
	infected by the virus is likely to see, and which should
	cause you to investigate whichever program is doing this).
	In any case, I recommend that you switch GateKeeper mode
	to NOTIFY & VETO now, and reboot and exercise some of the
	applications that you most often use, to see if any cause
	alerts of attempted modifications which seem  "unreasonable"
	(it may also be a good idea to move the System file out
	of the System folder, and replace it with a back-up
	copy -- I routinely always make a copy of the System file
	after an installation, keep it around in stuffed format,
	for just such occassions.  One caveat, however, if the
	System file backup was never used together with the
	latest Tune Up extension:  the first time it is booted,
	Tune Up WILL modify the System file, so don't let that
	one surprise or alarm you (once you see GateKeeper veto it,
	simple modify GateKeeper's permissions appropriately - read
	the docs - and reboot; that should take care of that one,
	at least, and is a good exercise to familiarize yourself
	with GateKeeper management anyway ..;-)

Removal of the virus:  Disinfectant neither notices nor can remove
	this new virus and, currently, I believe that only GateKeeper
	can stop its spread reliably, but cannot remove it from an
	infected application (that will require a new release of
	GateKeeper-Aid). But the important thing at this time, is
	for you to become aware of the infection, should you have
	it. And to stop the spread.  I will post updated information
	about all anti-virals shortly.

I apologize in advance for any errors or unclear advice, but
I hope to be able to provide better thought out information shortly.
do not flood me with question or request for advice today, though,
I am likely to ignore it, but may get helpers to respond back to you
later.  But this is not a good weekend, Easter and all, and many
helpers are travelling to attend a conference next week.

Subject: best integrity checker? (PC)

I think I know what the best scanners are, but what do you all (especially
Vesselin Bontchev) think is the best integrity checker?

I would be interested in opinions of the best with out regard to cost, and
the best cheap alternative if not the same. Unfortunately money must always
be factored into such a decision.

In general, you are right. The polymorphic viruses are viruses which
look differently in the different infected files. For this purpose,
the currently existing polymorphic viruses are using variable
encryption and modification of the encryption routine. Some viruses
use only variable encryption (Cascade), but they are not polymorphic,
since they can be detected by their decryption routine, which is
always one and the same.

Some of them weren't, in fact, but "a large portion" is too strong. See
my other message on this subject.

The current - yes, although it is not mandatory. And, they usually
change the decryption routine only. Very few of them (Whale, MtE)
change the algorithm as well.

Wrong. It's enough that the decryption routine changes (as it does
with all the representatives of the V2Px family). This makes it hard
enough to detect that the file is infected at all.

Yes, but it is usually used by them.

It doesn't do it well enough to make memory scanning prohibitive.
Whale is much better in that; it uses the so-called "sliding window"
technique much more, but it makes it slow down the infected machine a
lot and likely to be detected by the user.

Subject: Novell virus, Jon David, etc. (PC)

   Hello,
For those of you interested, here is some relevant information about the
purported Novell virus, or a variant of Jerusalem that was supposedly able
to bypass Novell security, as claimed by Mr. Jon David in 1990. I will also
quote sections from a response published in Netware Connection (Sep/Oct
1990), titled Comments on Computers Viruses & Netware Security by Mr. Eric
Babcock. This way, we will be looking at both sides of the story.

   Computers & Security published an article titled "The Novell Virus" by
Jon David in volume 9 (1990) 593-599. In this article, the author tells
about the experiments he and a few others performed in a Netware 2.15c
environment, and the results based on the performance of a virus
identified as Jerusalem-B. Some of the points in the article:

   1. Even though the worksation was given only Open and Read-Only access
      to programs on the server, the virus was able to change the date/time
      stamp of the program without being able to modify their contents.
      The article claims this is a violation of Netware security.

   2. When the workstation was given the Modify write, but not Write
      right, the virus was able to infect programs on the server.

   3. The virus was able to delete programs even if the workstation did
      not have Delete right, but only Write and Modify.

   Mr. Babcock wrote:

   "On a netware network, a workstation without the right to alter a file
can change the file's date/time stamp. Novell was not able to include
protection of the date/time stamp because a number of applications would
not operate without the ability to manipulate the stamp."

   He did not name any such applications. Even if this is true, it seems
that a correctly-implemented network app should not need such a capability.
Anyway, Jon David's claim in the first case is too strong in my opinion.
Although the ability to change a file's date/time stamp without Write
permission can be considered strange, it does not provide any virus with a
plattform to spread infection. As such, Netware security in this regard
is not flawed.
   Mr. Babcock continues to explain the Modify right and file attributes.
He states that much confusion exists in this area since Novell rights and
extended file attributes are mechanisms enforced by Netware quite
differently.
   Jon David's second observation, if true, is quite alarming. If a virus
can alter files that it should not be able write to, then something is not
working correctly. Did anyone out there perform similar experiments?
   Anyway, everyone is encouraged to read the references above before
paying attention to Network World hype which implied that the virus in
question had Netware-specific code to bypass security, which is incorrect.

Subject: Viruses via MS Windows OLE? (PC)

Microsoft Windows v3.1 provides a facility for embedding executable
code within datafiles (part of the "Object Linking and Embedding"
philosophy).  It occurs to me that this could allow viruses to sneak
in through the anti-virus procedures adopted by many organisations -
scanning "standard executables" and boot-sectors only.

Also, I have heard that some virus scanners search for virus patterns
only in places where the virus code would occur - if this means, for
example, the beginning or the end of a file, would this make a virus
invisible to such "smart" scanners?

Any comments would be appreciated.

Does that mean that they will fail under QEMM 6 STEALTH mode?

Subject: Virstop Stops (PC)

I just downloaded F-Protect 2.03a and ran into a strange problem. If I
run VIRSTOP twice, the machine hangs, the 3-finger salute doesn't work
and I have to cold boot. The first time virstop appears to work
properly; at least according to F-Test.

To be more specific, the machine locks up immediately after displaying
the message that virstop is already installed. No system prompt, no
keyboard response.

Just to make sure, I went back to the virstop from version 2.02d and
it does the same thing. I also checked the system very carefully,
including re-booting from a known clean copy of DOS 5.0 and running
F-Prot 2.03a over the whole system, which found nothing.

I am running a Zenith 386/33 with MSDOS 5.0 and PC-NFS (but virstop is
run after it loads).

Is this something new, or did I just miss this quirk before? I would
imagine that this could cause some difficulties for novice users. Me
included, obviously.

BTW could anybody tell me why some of the entries in the virus
informaiton list are coloured yellow and others are white (in v. 2.02d
- - I haven't had the time to look at 2.03a's information panel yet)?

Thanks.

Did you try booting from a clean floppy? I'll bet that your infected
with a boot sector virus...  If not, then DOS is doing something....
Maybe it could be the DOS internal device drivers that are causing the
reading.  Give more info... Like giving the name that the lister gives
on it.  If it says something to the effect of unknown, then you'r
probally infected with a computer virus that has either infected the
HD master boot record OR has infected the MS-DOS main system files.

Don't worry.  Vlad was just a phony label a programmer put into an
earlier (pre-release) version of NDW.  Either by omission, or because
it's kind of a funny name, it was left in there subsequently.  It's
not a virus, and I'm sure old Vladimir wasn't the culprit in your disk
crash.

  On a Netware server, the file SYS:SYSTEM\NET$OBJ.SYS contains the
"bindery" information for the server, similar to SYSUAF.DAT with VMS,
or passwd with UNIX.  It is locked and inaccessable during normal
operation of the server, but if you truly want to see what's in it do
the following:

o login as supervisor
o cd to SYS:SYSTEM
o run BINDFIX.EXE  (type bindfix, hit return)
o answer the prompts (bindfix is a maintenance program for the bindery)

  When BINDFIX is finished, you'll have a file called NET$OBJ.OLD,
this is the old version of NET$OBJ.SYS.  If for some reason you want
to restore your old NET$OBJ.SYS, go through the previous instructions
and substitute BINDREST.EXE for BINDFIX.

  To summarize (isn't verbosity a virtue on this list? ;-) There's no
need to scan NET$OBJ.SYS for infection; it's both inaccessable through
common means, and non-executable.  You might try using F-PROT for
server scanning, I've found it very convenient to work with.

  Log in as a READ ONLY user with read access to SYS:, map a drive to
SYS: (or the 'root' of whichever volume you need scanned) select
"network" as the target and go.  For the whole story, look up BINDFIX
in the "Utilities Reference" manual.

    Ok, you just know about it. If you or somebody tries to write virus
that removes this protection, you can:

         1. Have DOS 4.0 , 4.01 and 5.0 ( if you don't want to make virus
            very DOS-depended, i.e. to write virus, that removes protection
            in DOS 5.0 but can't in DOS 4.0 ).

         2. Analyze different methods (and they are REALLY different) of
            RLock protection in DOS 4.0 and 5.0.

         3. Be sure that I can't make changes in RLock, especially in
            its splicing position to DOS (and I MAKE them regularly).

         4. Be sure that your virus can't work in DOS 6.0, because RLock
            method would be changed again for the new DOS version.

    Direct calls to Int 13 are not allowed for any program at all, except
DOS itself. Some software can't work with this restriction, but all other
can. 99% of text editors, spreadsheets, compilers don't need direct
disk access.

  If you ask DOS nicely about BIOS direct access then my defence can
answer to your asking nicely too, but you can not receive address of
BIOS itself. This call returns with address of Int 13, and becomes
equil to call of Get Interrupt Vector. I doesn't find any software
that worked incorrectly while receiving this address (except viruses,
of course :-)

>   Am glad to see people thinking about solutions though.

  I don't propose solution for all times and peoples. I look to thing
as they are, without any optimism. But this idea can work for some time
(may be long enough to move from DOS to OS :-) preventing DOS and disks from
95-99% of file viruses.

Subject: Does any virus do this...? (PC)

A quick question:
does any virus write a byte (generation number or whatever) to the first
byte of the boot sector (the rest of the boot sector remaining okay)?
I know it would be a silly byte to change, but I recall that some viruses
change a byte somewhere (and I can't imagine how it would have changed
to zero otherwise).

Thanks in advance,
Mark Aitchison.

No offense, but this is a terrible and dangerous idea.  The whole
point of a distinctive biohazard symbol is so that people will notice
it and take appropriate action.  If it becomes something that is just
seen around casually, and has multiple meanings it will completely
lose its impact.

Hello.
I am please to announce the availability of FTP processing of the new version
of VIRX, as VIRX22.ZIP.  Following is the announcement sent (with the file) by
C. Glenn Jordan of the Microcom team.

Thanks Glenn!

		 Announcing a new release of VIRx !
		 ----------------------------------

   Microcom, Inc. and Ross Greenberg are proud to release
 the 2.2 version of the VIRx anti-virus scanner.  As always,
 it detects the vast majority of known MS-DOS viruses.  This
 version detects 126 new ones, for a total of 852 signatures.

   It does not disinfect or provide integrity checking like our
 commercial VIREX for the PC product suite, and Microcom does
 not provide any support to VIRx users.  However, it is free for
 individual or educational institution use.  It is not shareware.

   It is available from the usual Anti-Viral FTP sites, CompuServe,
 GEnie, Fido-Net and our own support BBS at (919) 419-1602 v.32bis.

 Below is the archive VIRx22.ZIP's contents as distributed:
