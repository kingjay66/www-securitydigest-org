VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  (The complete set of posting guidelines is available by
FTP on cert.sei.cmu.edu or upon request.)  Please sign submissions
with your real name.  Send contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU
(that's equivalent to VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).
Information on accessing anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue
archives is distributed periodically on the list.  Administrative mail

  My 386DX with DTK's multi-I/O (2s/1p/1g w/ 2floppy & 2 IDE) card,
and Western Digital's WD93044A 43Mb harddrive was recently infected
with the Michelangelo Virus (detected by Mcaffee's SCANV85).  Several
bootable and non-bootable 5-1/4" (both 360K and 1.2M) floppies were
infected.  (My PC has a 1.2M A: drive and a 1.44M B: drive) No 3-1/2"
floppies were found to be infected, although several
non-write-protected ones were used while the hard disk was infected.
My harddrive is partitioned into to logigal drives C: and D:.

  Indications of the virus were SLOW floppy disk access with DRDOS 6.0
on both floppies and the 2,048 bytes missing just below the 640K
barrier, as reported by CHECKIT 3.0.  The slow floppy disk access was
partly due to DRDOS's practice of actually reading more data off the
floppy disk than MSDOS 5.0.

  Note that My PC booted just fine numerous times from the harddisk
when it was infected.  Maybe your disk hardware was interacting differently
with the virus, causing it to not boot from it. Just a guess.

  BTW, I used McAffee's CLEANV85 to "remove" the virus from my harddrive.
Luckily, I overrode my usual laziness and backed up C: and D: before
doing so. When I "CLEANED" the harddisk, the partition table became
corrupted and I was unable to acces my 37Mbyte D: partition.  I've read
here that CLEANV85 will clean the harddisk, so maybe my hardware didn't
allow the CLEAN program to work correctly (no surprise, since IDE's
are fluky anyway.)

Thanks for the advice BUT:

Mine 286 did also JAM after i GOT THE SCAN85.ZIP!!!!!
Well, I have to admit that the extended/panded memory of mine isn't
working quite as it should, but now, after I got the scan it is
jamming more often than ever. And most of the time from COMMAND.COM!
Say I make a cd command and after pressing enter the gadget is stuck!
It happens every now and then.  I'd say once every 1 and a half hour.
I have not yet (after 3 active days) noticed any files missing. And
nothing is ever displayed, so if it is a virus, it has not gone off
yet. No scan nor any other program notices anything.  Not even memory
mappings. But still something weird is going on. Once (but only once)
the screen was blinking white and purple while the thing was jammed...
I had to reset the computer, as always when it jams.

After the first notions I have frequently scanned the whole computer,
with cv switch. But the only scan I have is this particular scan 85!!
So here is some info about the discussion. If you still think it is
not a virus, then good.  Is this just panic, or is it happening (on
the twilight zone)?  Programs, if they start, work so far normally...

Thanks for listening!! :))

Subject: SCAN configuration question (PC)

Could anybody tell me how to configure scan so that every time the a: and b:
drives are accessed it will automatically execute scan first and then do the
interrupt service routine for the disk access.  In other words what interrupt
vector is used for the disk service routine.

              Help greatly appreciated

Some of our computers on campus do not have enough hard disk space to

VIRSTOP.  What files are necessary to run only VIRSTOP?  Is this
possible?

A printer <does> send to the computer!, e.g. the "out of paper" signal  and  the
"hang on while I finish printing what you gave me before" signal. A printer does
not usually send bulk data because it has no means of receiving bulk data except
from the computer; but if the printer had its own microprocessor programmable by
user  or  supplier  or  virus/trojan, the printer could quite well keep emitting
copies of its virus.  Some  computers  are  quite  able  to  receive  data  from
printers,  e.g. I have a Cifer T4 terminal which can receive from its downstream
printer port in case that port is used for not a printer but e.g. an experiment.

Ha, you managed to get infected by a pretty new virus - I received a
copy of it yesterday. Haven't disassembled it yet, but at first glance
it seems that:

1) The virus is encrypted, but not polymorphic.

2) It is memory resident; uses INT 21h/AX=4BFFh to detect its presence
in memory.

3) It is a fast infector - infects both when you copy and execute
files.

4) Infects both COM and EXE files. The EXE files are padded up to the
next multiple of 16 before they are infected.

5) The virus is 1024 bytes long. The minimal lenght of the infectable
files seems to be 1536 bytes.

6) The virus is semi-stealth, i.e. it hides the fact that the files
become 1024 +/- 16 bytes larger. You won't notice the file increase if
you use the DIR command.

7) Couldn't find any intentional destructive routine in the virus
code.

There might be more, or some of the above might be incorrect, since I
haven't looked at the virus code very carefully; only glanced at it
while reading your message.

Hope the above helps.

Vesselin

Dennis, 
	There are a few programs that will detect and eliminate the
WDEF virus and any relatives.  There is a quick way to get rid of it
on your hard disk by rebuilding your desktop file.  This can be done
by holding down the Command and the option keys while your Mac is
booting.  You should get a dialog box that asks if you want to rebuild
your desktop.

The program that I use to keep my hard disk relatively virus free is 
Disinfectant (current version 2.5.1) There are two parts to this program
1. The viral scan and elimantion application
2. The system init that prevents viri (??) from entering your hard disk.

This program is available from most users groups or from various
internet archives is if you have ftp capability from your host.

Gatekeeper and Gatekeeper Aid are two other system inits that will
keep a virus from invading your hard disk.  The problem with these
progarms is that they must be taught what programs are allowed to do
operations that look similar to what a virus does. (Some what time
consuming)

	you don't have a WDEF virus, you have a messed-up file-system
	(due to a bug in the OS one hears about from different sources);

	you can try running DiskFirstAid and Diskinfectant first,
	but it won't help, probably.

	back-up, reformat, reload you disk.

	btw, your report failed to indicate what OS-version you
	are running and why you assumed that you had WDEF; you
	also don't indicate that you have run DFA and any anti-viral
	utilities (and what they reported) - why not? all anti-virals
	(latest version) handle all known critters just fine (and
	WDEF for a couple of years now), and several free ones are
	available.

	rumours get started that way ...

   It is hereby proposed that the term "polymorphic" be used fore this

How about this additon the glossary:

polymorphic virus - A virus using variable encryption with a
