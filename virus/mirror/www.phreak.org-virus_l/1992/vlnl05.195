Subject: WARNING - Vacsina Loader in Pkunzip.exe (PC)

Hi gang,

a user brought in a diskette with a driver for the Star LC24 printer.
He has obtained the diskette from the German branch of Star micronics.
Its sticker is labelled thus:

         <Star logo>

                       Star LC24-10

         Format: MS-DOS 720 KB
         Type A:\install

The diskette contains two .Doc, and one .txt, files (in English and
German), various .zip files, and two program files
         File-id        length    Creation date & time
         Install.exe    24436     26 Feb 1992  15:58h
         Pkunzip.exe    23660     10 Jul 1991  14:25h

The latter is "infected" with the Vacsina Loader,  i.e. no virus, but
the preparatory step of a Vacsina infection. VIRSTOP 2.06 will not allow
this file to be run.

We will inform Star micronics of this fact. I think, there is no
actual danger (the loader does not replicate by itself), rather an
inconvenience. Still, the Vacsina loader in a program file hints at
a possible Vacsina infection in one of the PCs used to produce that
disk, or the Pkunzip.exe copied to it, and we will tell the supplier so.

A note to Sysops of FTP servers: Please check your Pk-ware with F-Prot
2.06 (or any other scanner capable of detecting the Vacsina Loader).
The user told me he had obtained a Pkunzip.exe, including the Vacsina
Loader, from an Ftp server (though he cannot remember which one).

The copy of Pkunzip I use personally is clean:
         File-id        length    Creation date & time
         Pkunzip.exe    22540     15 Mar 1990  01:10h
Note that both copies of the Pkunzip.exe display 1.1 as their version
number.

Best regards,
                    Otto Stolz <RZOTTO@DKNKURZ1.Bitnet>

"Brain" is the name given to a small family of diskette-boot-infecting
viruses that appeared very early in the history of viruses (1987/88).
So a "brain virus" is just one family of viruses; nothing particularly
unusual about them.  They seem to be extinct in at least most of the
Western world.  The fact that they don't infect hard disks has a lot
to do with that, I suspect.  The original Brain virus was one of the
first to be "stealthed" (if it's active in memory, you can't see it on
diskette), but that fact doesn't seem to have done it much good!  *8)

Just to avoid confusion, since there are several anti-virus programs
that might be associated with the name "VIRSCAN", the one that Vess
was testing was IBM's Virus Scanning Program.  The current incarnation
of that technology in the U.S. is IBM AntiVirus/DOS and IBM
AntiVirus/2 (see a recent VIRUS-L for my brief announcement of those
products).  Still commercial, still cheap!  *8)

(Users outside the U.S. should contact their country IBM to see
what flavor of IBM's anti-viral software is available there.)

This is a very common support problem in our part of the
world...people notice a file has grown by ~950 bytes, and send it in
for analysis. Of all such calls, perhaps one or two have ever admitted
to having run the TAV "immunise" utility; most deny it categorically!
I don't think they intend to lie -- I think they actually have no idea
what software they've used, and certainly no idea what the
side-effects of its various options are.

No wonder that viruses have such a strong foothold round here :-)

Subject: does McAfee SCAN remove viruses? (PC)

    I recently got version 97 of SCAN and ran it on a 386 pc.  The pc
was STONED, and so I decided to check the disks that I had just used in it
(brand new harddrive so I knew that one of the disks was infected)

I did a "scan a:" on a writeprotected DOS diskette.  After checking the 
640 k of memory, it prints:

Scanning for known viruses.
  Virus removed.

Disk A: contains 2 directories and 7 files.

 No viruses found.

What's going on?

Subject: Is this a DOS virus? (PC)

	On one of our PC's we are observing some odd behaviour of our
DOS files.  The symptoms are: certain DOS files, share, dosshell and a
few others report that their size has been altered when I run a
CHKDSK.  Also we have been getting non-fatal errors during Windows
sessions.  In addition, one file reports that it has been "reallocated
to block 505."  I have ran F-prot 206, and pro-scan on it.  When they
read the files they report that the above files are "unreadable."
	I was wondering if anyone else is experiencing the same
behaviour, or if anybody has some ideas of what to look at.

Subject: Re: Untouchable (PC)

  Rick Wirthlin writes:
> I was wondering if anyone else is using the Untouchable virus scanner
> and how they find it.

This product was discussed here extensively about a year ago, so I'll
try to make this relatively brief.
  First of all, Untouchable is not itself a virus scanner in the usual
sense of the term, although it includes virus scanning modules (UTSCAN
and UTRES).  It is mainly an *integrity checking* package.  I'm not
sure whether you're asking specifically about those scanning modules or
whether you've confused the terminology and are really interested in
Untouchable as an integrity checker.
  UTSCAN has the ability to examine archives and compressed executa-
bles (recursively), includes one of the better MtE detectors (its
inability to detect some Groove mutations was corrected even before
Vesselin's report appeared), and is quite fast.  Moreover, the low
scores of previous versions of UTSCAN in terms of percentage of
viruses detected seems to be a thing of the past (the authors claim
that the latest version of UTSCAN scores higher on the CARO test suite
and disinfects more reliably than F-PROT 2.06a).  However, UTSCAN
requires a lot of RAM.
  The integrity checker UT is, in my opinion, excellent.  It is one of
the few which also perform generic disinfection.  Moreover, at every
stage in time, UT seems to detect some types of viruses which other
integrity checkers do not.  For example, even early (1988) versions of
UT (under the name "VirAlarm") were able to detect companion viruses,
which began to appear only in 1990 (most other integrity checkers
added this capability only after such viruses appeared, and quite a few
checkers can't detect them even today!), and UT still detects a couple
of types of viruses which have not yet appeared.

  I take this opportunity to say that imho, Robert Slade's recent
evaluation of Untouchable misses the mark.  I won't go into details
here, but in general, it gives more weight to lesser important things
(like the damaged diskette which he happened to receive, rarely needed
features of UT, and slowness on an XT) than to the really important
ones.  (I'd be glad to discuss these with you by personal e-mail, Rob,
if you're interested.)

Subject: Virus naming cross-reference updated (PC)

Hello, everybody!

I finally managed to update the virus naming cross-reference. A full
listing of the files in out collection, divided into boot sector
viruses, file viruses, trojans, jokes, etc.; information how the three
scanners with best detection rate call the different viruses (and
other pieces of malware); the standard CARO names; etc.

The three scanners used are:

	- Dr. Solomon's FindVirus 6.07 with drivers of 19-Nov-92.
	- F-Prot 2.06b
	- McAfee's VIRUSCAN 9.0V99

The first one is a commercial product. I have no idea what is the
actual version shipped to the customers; I used the latest version I
have received from S & S International.

The second product I have not yet seen this version on the usual ftp
sites; Frisk sent it directly to me.

The third product I have downloaded directly from McAfee's ftp site.

The last two product are shareware, as you probably all know.

A few people asked me why I do not include other scanners in these
comparative reviews. The answer is that they are NOT comparative
reviews. Their purpose is not to show which scanner is better
(although a lot of information about the scanner can be extracted from
them). Their purpose is to show the standard CARO names of all viruses
known to us (i.e., to VTC-Hamburg), together with a cross-reference of
how the three scanners with best detection rate are calling them. It
would be useless to include other scanners with a lower detection
rate, because they will give just no names for a serious part of the
viruses...

OK, the files are available from our ftp site,
ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de, in the /pub/virus/texts/tests
directory. Here is a short description of each of the archives:

reports.zip	- ASCII file, containing a multi-column listing (about
		  220 characters per line) of the file names, the 
		  standard CARO name of the virus in the file, the 
		  name used by Findvirus, the name used by F-Prot, and 
		  the name used by SCAN.

reps_ps.zip	- Same as above, but in PostScript, 4 bp.

naming.zip	- Four documents, describing the CARO virus naming
		  scheme and the names of every single boot sector and 
		  file infector, known to the VTC-Hamburg. Some other 
		  forms of malware are also listed.

namng_ps.zip	- Same as above, but in PostScript.

The listings are relatively up-to-date. They reflect the contents of
out virus collection on December 1st. However, there are about half a
dozen new viruses from Poland, which are not classified yet, and as I
am writing this a bunch of new viruses just arrived in the mail...
Sigh... :-(

As I said, John McAfee was -quoted- to have said that. Here is what
the article says:

    "If your product competes with mine, I'd like for those customers of
mine to know that your product isn't as good as mine," he [McAfee] said.

In the beginning I was sending them to you, since you were the person
from McAfee Associates who were most present on the net. I also used
to discuss the technical questions with Morgan Schweers, who was more
technically competent on the subject. Some time ago, you told me that
Igor is the one involved in the detection/disinfection problems, so I
should report such problems to him. He also told me to send copies of
such reports to him. That's what I am doing. If you insist, I'll send
them to you instead. However, I definitively refuse to send them
- -twice-. Is the internal communication between the employees of McAfee
Associates really so bad? Isn't it enough that I am finding the bugs
in your software and sending you reports about that, so that you are
asking me to do it twice?

Ken De Cruyenaere asks

Speaking of native OS/2 applications, to my knowledge IBM has the only
shipping OS/2 antiviral product available.  The old version was called
simply the IBM Scanning Program.  They just came out with a new
version with a CUA interface called IBM AntiVirus/OS/2 (and a DOS
version too).  I have ordered this product but haven't received it
yet.  Dr. Solomon was supposed to have an OS/2 version of his product
available some time ago, but I don't think its seen the light of day
yet (maybe now that they've introduced their Windows version...).
Also, ASP says they will be coming out with an OS/2 version of their
Integrity Toolkit sometime.

Yes, I too wish that F-PROT, otherwise an excellent product, could be
modified to recognize the fact that it may be running on an OS/2
machine (from my perch of ignorance, it seems to me that it shouldn't
take more than a few lines of code).  Maybe Frisk is waiting for the
infamous "critical mass" of complaints.  :<)

You can find the McAfree and Virus Scan for OS/2 (BETA!) at
ftp-os2.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151) under /pub/os2/2.0/diskutils.  The
file you want is os_scb97.zip. You also need to use Info-ZIP's UNZIP
5.0 to unzip the files from this ftp site. I haven't had any problems
with the software on my FAT partitioned drives. Also this only runs
under OS/2 2.0 not 1.x.

Subject: Second generation problems (Philosophy)

One of the ways I can tell what people are thinking about is by the
kinds of problems they are having. First generation problems are the
ones that "come with the territory" such as preventing viruses like
STONED when a reboot checks the A: drive first.

Second generation problems are the ones that only become apparent when
a "fix" for the first generation problem is applied e.g. Some BIOSes
allow selection of C: as the boot drive. Sometimes you *want* to boot
from A: (to remove disk cacheing so that disk defragmentation can take
place) but do not want to change the CMOS & boot several times to do
so.

At first glance, the problem seems easy - write a DOS program to boot
from A:. On trial it becomes apparent that things do not work that way
primarily because during the boot, the MBR and DBR expect certain
values to be just so and they are different after DOS has loaded.

As I mentioned earlier, the answer is fairly straightforward - some
code in the MBR (pleanty of room) so that if a certain key is struck
during boot, it will be redirected to the A: drive. This works.

But it brings up a third generation problem: If this is done, is the
original reason for selecting the C: drive in the first place negated
since we have just reopened a window for infection OR does this
provide an avenue for those who have not utilized the CMOS boot
redirection because of an occasional need to boot from floppy to use
the additional protection ?

In other words, if this were added in conjunction with boot drive
selection, would overall protection go up or down ? I *believe* it
would go up for the second reason and, since it takes an overt act
(pressing a key) one might have a reasonable expectation that the user
checked the floppy in the drive first. Comments ?

(Incidently, it is very handy at home to bring up the LAN since QEMM
and the other TSRs normally loaded must be suppressed but still want
to maintain my *other* protections). You *can* have your cake...)

ps for those using 3COM 3C503 cards in early XTs, the 3C503.EXE diagnostics
   program has a not-very-well-documented /S switch. I had a *situation*
   where the card failed the diagnostics (RAM/ASIC test) but the LAN seemed 
   to be working just fine. With the /S (slow?) switch the diagnostics passed.

  Rather than one node per virus indicating reported incidents, I'd
rather see nodes for each geographic area, so that results imply (?)
product A does better on common eastern European viruses, product B is
better for common Australian viruses, etc. (standard Epidemiology?)

  As a virus spreads, it would then have more non-zero nodes affecting
the composite, and a larger influence on the rating of the anti-viral
product being tested. Age of the virus is moot if it doesn't spread.
("Lab animals" would have zero or one node)..

  The problem, of course, is the quality of reporting:
  - duplicate reports of a single incident must be disallowed, while
multiple or recurring incidents need to be differentiated and included.
How does the test site tell if these are discreet incidents?
  - accuracy of virus identification by the reporting sites is always
suspect (but then, if they were 100% accurate, they'd be using the
product we're looking for, right? :-)).
  - reports on the growth side of the curve may be fairly accurate,
but reporting on the plateau and decline sides is erratic.

  What is needed is an independent site with statistically varied but
controlled "tripwire" sites to sample the activity worldwide. That
implies an international effort with international funding, staff, and
a formal reporting protocol. (see, Padgett, someone is listening....)

The copy that showed up on my queue 12/9/87 (the 5th anniversary is
almost upon us) used "mohn tack jeah" for "month day year" and variable
names like "wer von wo ist rest", which agrees with this origin.

   The REXX exec actually invoked the SendFile command with the "ACK"
option, requesting delivery confirmation, adding to overall traffic.

 The last line of the one I got was "ERASE CHRISTMA EXEC", but that only
removed the file saved to disk (as the exec completed it's run).
Some users saw that line and disabled it before they ran it.
Others received the file, but did not run it.
In those cases, it remained on user disks.

Perhaps I can clarify the confusion about whether or not CHRISTMA
erased itself, and also give justification to my classification of
CHRISTMA as a Trojan Horse, not a worm or virus.

The VM operating system does not lend itself to either worms (as in
the Morris worm) or viruses.  This is one of its strengths.  Mr.
Slade's description of Rexx is correct, it is an interpreter (altho a
complier is available) and thus a Rexx file is a program and can be
edited as data.  Such a file can be sent to other users on the same
computer or it can be sent to other users on different computers via
the RSCS BITNET network and the VNET network.  The CHRISTMA exec was
distributed this way.  It was not a worm because no connection was
made between two systems to establish a portion of a program which, if
it found the environment hospitable, would drag the rest of the
program along behind it as the Morris Worm did (the same way an inch
worm moves).  It was not a virus, because it did not attach itself to
other programs or data when it executed.

The file, when sent, physically was delivered to the receiving
computer's spooling system.  VM maintains a common area for all users
for mail and files sent to them.  When a user logs on he can list the
files he owns in this common area.  He can display them and if he
chooses, can receive them onto his minidisk.  The CHRISTMA program
then, appeared in users' lists of spool files as a gift from someone
else (as was the Trojan Horse).  If the user received the CHRISTMA
exec onto his disk, (taking the Horse inside the gates in the analogy)
that copy was deleted from the spooling system (which may be the
origin of the idea that it destroyed itself).  Then, IF the user ran
the program (opening the Horse and releasing the soldiers) a christmas
tree was drawn on the screen and copies of the program were
distributed.  The program remained on the users minidisk and could be
executed any number of times.

The best defense, of course, is not to take the horse inside the
gates: don't receive any program files from someone you don't know,
and don't run programs without reading them to find out what they do.

This note and my previous one are sent in the interests of accuracy
and are not intended to be flames.

We deleted our reference copy of CHRISTMA just a little while ago, now
I wish we hadn't so I could verify my information.  We had two copies
of it, one from the initial distribution and one from the second the
following year.  It could very well be that someone altered the
original program to erase itself in order to make it more difficult to
track down.

I do remember erasing copies of the program from users' minidisks and
also checking their netlog files to determine what other users had
been sent copies.  So our first version, at least, did not erase
itself.
