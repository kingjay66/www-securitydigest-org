In an idle moment I put together the following batch file to convert
the 04-09-91 version of CHKDSK.EXE from MS-DOS 5.00 to the 11-11-91
model (only a three byte change after all). No guarentees but it seems
to work ok on my PCs. Please follow the instructions exacticalylylyly.

Subject: Posting Philosophy (PC)

Recently I have been posting too many things about CHKDSK.EXE and wish
to apologise to the readers. It does point out a desperate need
though.  (Yes, Virginia, we are back to a National Laboratory).

Consider all of the bandwidth that has been used to say three things:
1) What the risk was.
2) How do you tell if you are at risk.
3) What do you do about it.

And really this should have occurred sometime before 11-11-91 since it
was known then. For me, it was just chance that the disk purchased
just over a month ago did mot suffer the same fate (one partition is
within 100 "allocation units" of the danger mark). True, it has been
just in the last year that big disks became common and since most disk
compression routines use 8,192 byte clusters, they were not at risk
(though the day before yesterday I saw a system with a 600Mb STACKed
disk - guess what the number of clusters was ?)

But, if we had at any time a responsible posting giving the three
elements above as an "advisory", note would have been taken,
corrections made, and we would have gone on. It wasn't and disks had
to become corrupted before public notice was made and then knee-jerk
reactions were made (does this sound like Michelangelo).

NIST has apparently abandoned the PC. Magazines try but they are not
necessarily looking at the right things or looking the right way. So
it is relegated to us amateurs & like most things "you get what you
pay for".

                                And a Merry Christmas to all,

Good morning Vesselin,

The Generic Boot Sector and Master Boot Record (partition table) virus
detection routines are actually looking for several common instructions 
that appear over and over again in different viruses such as Stoned, 
Joshi, and so forth.  By looking for these, we can detect variants/new
viruses based on older viruses.

The Generic Boot Sector/MBR code is not doing a "fitness check" to see
if the partition table (the actual data) or 55 AA signature is valid,
since those would not neccessarily be due to a virus infection (e.g.,
could be an unformatted drive).  Likewise, we don't do a filename check
since that could cause false positives with non-DOS operating systems 
such as Unix and OS/2.

If it's only one file, or is not a COM or EXE file, or is less than
2K, you most probably have a false id.  DAME=Dark Avenger Mutation
Engine.  It's what everyone else is calling MtE.  I believe only
McAfee calls it DAME.

If indeed you are using McAfee, they'll probably want a copy of the
reported file to investigate.

Uh, not correct.  VirStop CAN swap its signatures out to disk (with the /DISK)
switch, in which case the memory requirements drop down to 2K or so.

Well, of course it does not give a name - it does not match any of the
known variants.

There are several possibilities:

    1) Really a new variant.
    2) An old variant, perhaps corrupted by something, so the checksum
       does not match.
    3) Previously infected, but incorrectly disinfected.

However, without further information I really cannot say what is going
on.

You should not use this, unless you have actually defined some new
strings...othewise it will just slow the program down a.

Without further information it is hard to tell.  What program reports

I have varients of stoned which copy to 0,0,15, and 0,0,7, as well as a

Please read the FAQ for a description how to report such cases. In
particular, you should state the name and the version of the program
that reported the virus.

"DAME" is the name that SCAN gives to all MtE-based viruses. However,
a few other scanners use it too... The MtE detector in SCAN versions
before 99 is not good enough and might sometimes report false
positives. Did you get a report only about one infected file or about
several files?

It is not possible to tell you "what the DAME virus does", because
there is no such thing as "the DAME virus". There are several
different viruses, which are using the MtE for polymorphism and they
do different things. All of them are reported as DAME by SCAN (except
some of the unencrypted replicants, but this is irrelevant).

At last, a low level format is never necessary. Just delete all
infected files and replace them with clear originals.

Vesselin

The MBR is DOS ver. independant.  Simply boot his DOS 3.0 machine with

This tail is a form of integrity checker, and is added to the file 
(in exactly the same way as a virus) by part of the CPAV/CARMEL 
anti-virus software.  When you run the program it is run first, and 
warns you if the start of the file, or the length, has been changed.  

This is a nice idea, but unfortunately this product has caused a 
number of users a lot of problems by protecting pre-existing viruses 
it has failed to detect. "Intelligent" scanners will generally fail 
to find viruses protected in this way, as the initial entry point 
goes to the CPAV software, instead of the virus. Logically "dumb" 
scanners ought to find the virus, but may not do so in practise.  

We have just received a new strain of Zerotime (or Slow) in which 
the decryption procedure has been patched to avoid detection.  The 
sample disk we received had many files in which the virus was 
protected in this way.  Because the CPAV software overwrites the 
start of the file (after saving it elsewhere) it has split the 
encryption procedure in two.  Neither part is long enough to detect 
reliably, without causing many false alarms, and so it is not 
possible to detect the virus unless the CPAV software is removed.

The virus will emerge, and make itself obvious by infecting new 
files (and also the ones with the "protected" virus), in the normal 
way immediately you run an infected file, but the source will remain 
hidden.  If you are having trouble getting rid of a virus you should 
treat any files "protected" by this product with extreme suspicion.

In investigating this we re-examined samples we had collected from a 
shop having virus like problems.  At the time we did not know about 
this product (which had been added by the proprietors son, without 
permission), and assumed it was causing the problems.  However when 
we looked at the files again we found that Padded virus was hiding 
behind the Carmel software.  Neither McAfee Scan nor Dr. Solomon's 
Toolkit can find the virus in these files. 

We know of two strains of this product, and have added signatures 
for them to VET 7.11.  This will flag affected files as "Packed with 
CPAV anti-virus."

I know almost nothing about OS/2, but are these files really
executable? OK, I understand that they contain executable code, but
can they be started from the command line or by clicking on them? You
see, there are currently no known OS/2 viruses. Any known-virus
scanner for OS/2 can only scan for DOS viruses. Therefore, it makes
sense for it to scan only things that the known DOS viruses can
infect. In order a known DOS virus to infect something, it must either
have an executable extension, or it must be executed by the Exec
function call. Are the files with the extensions mentioned by you
executed in this way? If not, then it does not make sense to scan them
for viruses...

What do you mean? If a file is really overwritten before it is
deleted, then what's the point to undelete it?

Please, try NETSCAN 99B instead and post the results. Be aware,
however, that it will not check the boot sectors.

The Fam* viruses reported by SCAN are something like heuristic scan
strings. They are signatures (usually very short) for code that is
often found in viruses. In this way they can detect a lot of silly 
viruses with a few short signatures, but no identification of the
virus can be obtained. Don't consider such reports as indications of a
particular virus; instead consider them just as reports for viral
code.

Correct, but SCAN (as most other scanners) is not able to distinguish
between the different MtE-based viruses. I agree, however, that the
description of the "DAME virus" in VIRLIST.TXT is completely bogus.

> It would be better to introduce a new column for viruses using MtE.

A better idea is to introduce a new column, for polymorphism. This
would be more general, since there are many other polymorphic viruses,
not only the MtE-based ones...

Probably, yes. The delimiter is a dot. In my tests I am using the
switch like this: "/EXT=COM.EXE.SYS.BOO". It was me who insisted that
Frisk includes something similar in his program, so I knew the
syntax... :-) Isn't it explained well in the docs?

See the FAQ, question B8), "What is a companion virus?". :-) We've put
quite a lot of effort in this FAQ, it would be nice if at least some
people read it... :-))

This is not actually a problem. Since the scanner runs in its own area
of memory, protected from the other processes, it cannot be fooled by
a stealth virus and cannot be made to spread a fast infector on all
files it scans... In fact, I am wondering why a memory check is
performed at all by an OS/2-based scanner...

Do you know any way in which a known DOS virus can infect an extended
filename on an HPFS partition?

That's good news! It would be a good idea to make SCAN for DOS act the
same way! This will be one self-modifying program less...

The interesting fact is that as far as I know this is a concept that

Exactly. The same argument may be used about privacy concerns and ANI/

Subject: Viral Based Distribution System

Fred Cohen has brought up the point that virus design techniques can
be used for beneficial purposes. In his example he describes a
network product that installs itself without the user ever having to
know its there.

Instead of discussing a variety of basic problems involving
distribution and maintance of a viral based system, all of which are
system specific and a nit picker could find ways to solve each and I
could come up with a new problem ad inifnitum ad nightem. Instead I
will discuss one major, system non-specific, problem:SECURITY.

For a destructive program to do damage, it must be executed in one
form or another. The nature of the program, virus, trojan, or just
badly writen, is not relevant. The first line of defense against
these types of programs is through tracking and control of all
executable programs. Viruses, by their very nature, are a wildcard.
The only effective means of executable control is to keep absolute
control over access to the executables. That way accurate records
can be kept on file size, content, check codes, etc. A virus, by
it's very nature, denies this ability. For a virus to be effective
it must be executed. How is it to be executed? 

If the purpose of the program is to automatically cause some
'change' in various computers, then the program must execute from a
loader or an infected file. If its being launched from a loader then
the need for the distribution system is nullified. Assuming the goal
is to still keep absolute system security, then the loader will be
'allowed' in by the administrator but the virus it is loading won't
be allowed to attach itself to another program, just make the change
for the single user that activated the loader. If this is an
effective means of distribution then why use a virus at all? 

If, on the other hand, the loader can not be trusted, then a virus
may come in to play. If I can't be sure that all my users will
execute the loader and update their system then I can have a virus
go through and infect all sorts of executables until I finally hit
one a user will execute and thus have their system updated. Leaving
aside the question of how effective this sort of distribution
mechanism is, there is the question of executable integrity. If the
virus distribution system is to work it must be able to violate
system security. It must be able to infect the system executable
files. This means that file size, content, checksum codes, and so on
will all change in an unpredictable manner. This quickly turns
system security into system guessing. An unacceptable situation.

In conclusion, a system that changes in an unpredictable manner,
that uses hard to track mechanisms of change, is a security
nightmare. Just as self modifying programs have been given a very
bad reputation for very good reasons, a viral based distribution
system deserves a similarly bad reputation.

Subject: Request For Polymorphic Virus paper references

I am currently writing a paper on polymorphic virus design and
detection. The paper's focus is on designing self modifying programs
(my interest in this area comes from my interest in Artificial
Intelligence, the concept of a program that can alter it's own code
facinates me) as well as problems associated with detecting a specific
polymorphic virus.

However I have no desire to reinvent the wheel. Along
this line I have been trying to track down any articles written on
the subject. Unfortunatly, UCLA's computer index leaves a bit to be
desired when it comes to finding virus articles and books. As such
any pointers to articles and books that address the issues of
polymorphic viruses would be appretiated. I am not interested in
loading mechanisms, distribution mechanisms, or payload design. Just
the mechanisms of causing a program to swap, insert, encrypt, or
otherwise alter itself so as to fool scanners and like programs.
