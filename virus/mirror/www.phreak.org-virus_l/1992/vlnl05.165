Hi all!

I just wrote the 'void MtE(int Len)' subroutine. It's my old subroutine
Emulator_86() but it is very optimized. This subr is maked on Borland-C,
I know that it's better to write this on Assembler, but the time ... :-( .
I erased the analyse of all instructions which are not generated by MtE and
add the 286 MtE instructions.

This routine decrypts 'Len' or more bytes of MtE-encrypted code.
It works not fast - up to 1/2 seconds per file infected by MtE-based virus
on AT-286/16Mz. It removes the virus very slowly, may be 1-2-4-8 seconds per
infected file, but the all the files are cured OK!
The noninfected files are checked very fast.

I also use the next method: I try to MtE-decrypt every file for 80h
bytes of the virus body. After this procedure I (my antivirus) check
the decoded codes for the first bytes of the MtE-viruses, if the some
bytes are equal to virus' bytes then I decrypt more bytes (if it's needed).

So it's needed several minutes to append a new MtE-based virus to my
anti-viral database.

This routine is ready, but it needs some optimization and checking for
several thousends of MtE.


A problem:
I try to infect the files on the 'sartifical XT' - and some files (about 1/3)
are infected incorrectly! and these files are infected OK on 'sartifical AT'.
Why? Where are the bugs of MtE algorithm?


The question:
Are some of the MtE-based viruses 'wild' in the West?

In Russia these viruses are not wild. The MTE090.ZIP and magazine 40Hex are
not available in Russia (it's very good), but the russian wirus-vriters
tries to make polymorphic viruses. For example, the "ABC" virus and the
viruses from "Mutant" family. I think that they are Russian because they are
not known to western antiviral programs. These viruses uses the algorithms
of en/decryption which are more difficult that the "V2P6" and "Amoeba"
algorithms, nor that MtE.


The best MtE-regards,

Subject: Virus slowing down PC and causing beeps at boot? (PC)

Does anybody know a virus which slows down the system and causes a
beep sequences if one reboots the computer?  I have this problem when
I work with WordPerfect5.1 on my 386.  I think it's not because of
swapping and system memory management that it takes so much time to
move the cursor in the WP51 document.  It's the same strange behaviour
in big as in small documents.

Additionally I sometimes have difficulties in using the printer from
inside WordPerfect5.1.  That means sometimes one can print and
sometimes the print job's just stuck in the printer queue whereas the
printer is ready and idle.  If you try to change printer setup one can
sometimes read "cannot find WP.FIL" and as soon as one changes to
'printer control' the program locks up.  Its occurence still is
unpredictable.  Although I did several different ways of new
installation I always got this printer problem since around 21./22. of
September '92.

If there's anybody who could help me or give me any hint, his reply
would be really appreciated!

Thanks in advance,
 Markus.

Subject: WordPerfect Mutant Files & Novell (PC)

There has been a recurring problem here that I am hoping someone else
has had and can give me a few pointers about.  I am new to this
newsgroup, so I apologize if you have discussed this ad infinitum and
I missed it.

Some background, I work in an University computer lab.  We are open 24
hours/day, 7 days/week.  There are 120 or so IBMs and compatibles
using NetWare 3.11.  True, this is not the most secure environment,
but we take as many precautions as possible.  (McAffee Vshield, and
scan as many incoming disks as possible).

The problem is that for the past year or so (maybe longer), every so
often one of our WordPerfect files "goes mutant" on us.  This hasn't
happened on a regular basis by any means, but it has occurred often
enough for us to pin down the problem.  What happens is that one of
the User's temporary files .BV1 .TV1, will grow to be over 1 meg or
more of disk space.  All computers will get the System message "Server
Almost Out Of Disk Space".  The "mutant" files will not show up on the
server until the person's computer has already locked up and they have
rebooted their system already.  Too make the situation more
interesting, we keep about 100 megs free on the server.  Once the
mutant file is deleted, all the disk space frees up.

If any of you have seen this problem, please e-mail me.  If anyone
would like to know more details, I'll get 'em.  I would like to think
there may be an explanation for the problem.  But that may be wishful
thinking.

Thank You In Advance

Subject: Michaelangelo on Driver Disks (PC)

An infection of Michaelangelo has been found on some factory sealed
diskettes owned by an associate of mine.  They were discovered during a
routine scan of floppies originating from his machine.  Once the
infection was discovered, he ran F-PROT V205 against the disk and his
entire collection of floppies, including the factory sealed (write -
protect tab is under the factory provided label or has no write protect
notch).  His hard disk, of course, showed infection as did the VGA
driver floppies (these are factory sealed).  Identification on the
floppies was:
	PVGA 1024x
no manufacturer.  As the VGA card and floppies were obtained from a
Pacific Rim distributer, it is assumed that these diskettes are of
similar origin.
	Sorry if this is a repeat of an old posting, but if it is, then
there appears to still be a crop of these babies out there.
	BTW, my associate sends many thanks to "frisk" for the use of
his program. (It kept him out of hot water with his 6 year old who
"shares" the computer with him.)

Subject: HELP! (Re: IBM password) (PC)

I just posted this to comp.security.misc, but I figure I'll post it
here for anyone else that has suggestions:

We have just installed a new lab of Gateway 486-33 machines with IDE
hard drives.  The BIOS (Phoenix 4.03 00) doesn't have a documented way
of password protecting the machine.

A student has installed some form of password protection on the
machine.  If you boot from a floppy disk, the machine hangs.  If you
boot from the hard-drive, the screen clears and the word 'Password:'
is displayed.

We suspect it's some form of commercial or shareware password protection
that imbeds itself in the partition table or some other place where it
will be activated during power-on self test.

Do you have any suggestions (besides removing the hard drives - which
we're considering ?)

Incidentally, it's quite likely that the student responsible is reading
this forum.  Also, apologies if this is a FAQ, I'm constructing a data-
base job to search the archives now.

Subject: SCAN 95b doesn't find MtE in EXE files (PC)

Hello, everybody!

I was preparing an updated review of the ability of the popular
scanners to detect the MtE-based viruses. The tests are not finished
yet, but the very preliminary results showed that VIRUSCAN version 95b
from McAfee Associates NEVER detects EXE files infected with these
viruses. ALL of the generated 4,000 infected EXE files were missed!

Currently there are two MtE-based viruses that infect EXE files -
CoffeeShop (infects only EXE files) and Groove (infects both COM and
EXE files). The scanner also missed hundreds of infected COM files,
but this is another story...

Having in mind how popular this scanner is, I thought that I should
post an urgent warning: DON'T RELY ON SCAN FOR DETECTION OF MtE-BASED
VIRUSES!

If you suspect that you are infected with a MtE-based virus, try the
program CatchMtE. This program detects MtE-based viruses ONLY and is
freeware. If you need a scanner that is able to detect other viruses
too, try F-Prot (shareware, free for individual use). Version 2.05
(might not be the latest) was able to detect ALL MtE-infected samples
in our tests. Both programs can be obtained from our ftp site,
ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de (IP=134.100.4.42), directory
pub/virus/progs, files catchm14.zip and fp-205.zip.

Actually you have two options: The first is since the bootup selection
is stored in CMOS, all that is necessary is a) knowlege of which byte
makes selection and b) a small (c.a. 10h byte + ASCII) .COM to check
that it has not changed.

Just for one source (more kudos) AMI maintains on their bulletin board
a number of technical documents (albeit in WP format 8*( that describe
the CMOS addresses and meanings), that how I found mine.

The second is my FREEWARE program NoFBoot (found inside the FixUtil3.Zip)
that will protect against warm boots from floppy. IMHO such a three layer
protection is probably enough.

As a sidelight, in another lifetime when I was involved in the design of
digital flight controls for the F-16 and F-111 one of the major elements
was failure and redundancy management. As a general rule, flight critical
systems were designed to two-fail-operational, third-fail-safe (the last
was aka "Land It Now !"). Among other things, the failure to detect a failure
was considerd an automatic second-failure (of course detecting the 
failure to detect was Yet Another problem. Such considerations color many 
of my V-L postings).

ps Finally bit the bullet and bought a 14.4 Fax/Modem (Under US300 + US20 
   for the Caller-Id ROM from a mail order house, abt 3/4 list price)
   and the difference over my old 2400 unit is amazing. Should pay for itself
   in short order (I get a volume discount from Sprint). (Does this make
   a 300 baud TI Silent 700 a collectable ?).

   What seems really incredible is that some people are still selling data-
   only modems and trying to get the same price and more...

   Another interesting point is that the magazines cannot keep up with 
   the rate of change anymore. A recent review includes this modem but
   since the review ROM changes added fall-forward and MNP-10, both 
   impressive features. Anymore, you just about have to call the company
   to find out what the special-of-the-week is, I'm finding it nearly
   a full time hobby just staying current.

   Suspect 14.4 *might* be a limit for a while since the PC serial port
   hardware, particularly the 8450, is straining a bit at this level,
   the 16550AFN has a 16 byte buffer and is better but at 57,400 effective, 
   the Windows overhead becomes excessive. 

   Can see a market opening up for serial cards with 16k (32?, 64?) byte 
   I/O buffers RSN particularly if VSUM gets any bigger ('09 is 700k).

Ha! This is an understatement - I would say that they don't know how
to write any working code at all... If you manage to get their program
running (which is not that trivial, as you have observed), you'll see
that the viruses that they are generating are extremely buggy (besides
being simplistic non-resident COM infectors). Most of them do not
assemble, those that do hang the machine when executed and those that
don't hang usually refuse to spread...

Let's hope all virus writers will write code with this "quality"...
It's just so boring to disassemble it...

> to get it to work on a 286 with a black and white screen (HGA)?  Or do

Probably the routines for the flashy window interface do not know
about this video adapter and write to the wrong address when accessing
the video RAM. Try an EGA or even CGA adapter - it might work.

No permanent damage. Transient damage: every fourth time the virus
infects a file, it displays the message "Larry on a Screen".

Correct, the virus infects them only on execution (not on copying) and
the file type is recognized by the file extension (not by the magic
number in the first two bytes.

The virus uses an interesting trick to preserve the date of the
infected files. It normally opens the file for reading and writing,
without bothering to get the date & time. Then, just before closing
the file it has written to, the virus consecutively does
GetDateAndTime and SetDateAndTime. Seems that the trick works...
Probably because DOS updates the time & date information during the
Close operation, not during the Writes.

From my experience, VCL needs a color monitor.  I tried to install it
on our mono 286 with no luck.  Actually, we got it to install with
difficulty on a color system.

No, I haven't.  My statement above is misleading and I apologize.
Neither Stealth Bomber nor any other virus detection package, present
or future, will detect all possible viruses.  In addition to doing a
CRC check (which will catch any non-stealth file virus) Stealth Bomber
looks for suspicious behaviour in DOS related to stealth viruses.
Unfortunately, some versions of DOS exhibit virus-like symptoms
(DR-DOS 6.0 comes to mind) and I have the same problem with false
alarms that Fridrik Skaluson has with the heuristic virus search in
F-Prot.  Because of the nature of my package, false alarms are
unacceptable and I have to specifically exclude such behaviour from my
tests.

My resources are somewhat limited, so if anyone can provide me with
details on exactly what DIR-II and other stealth viruses that Stealth
Bomber misses do, I will gladly try to check for them as well.
Stealth Bomber is a public domain package, and any help in maintaining
it will be greatly appreciated.

The file BOOT.DOS is one which OS/2 creates upon installation on your
hard disk (which is why it isn't on any of the OS/2 distribution
diskettes).  It contains an image of your original DOS boot sector,
allowing you to dual boot to DOS.  When you dual boot to DOS, the BOOT
program copies this image file back to the boot sector location and
changes your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT back to their DOS versions,
so DOS can boot.  If you have a DOS virus in your boot sector, OS/2
will make an image of that virus when it creates BOOT.DOS.  The way to
get rid of it is to dual boot to DOS, reboot using a clean DOS
diskette so that FORM isn't active, and then run a disinfection
program on your hard disk.

Subject: DOK-V 1.00 Alpha-A test engine ready to FTP. How do I do it?

Hi Everybody! :)
 A while ago, I had posted a notice requesting information on virus signatures,
and and relevant information on PC Based viruses, I would like to thank all the
people who have helped me thus far in obtaining, verifying, & in some cases re-
obtaining and verifying the information for my humungous project. I believe the
largest stumbling block was the development of the actual database engine. but
through much patience, perseverence, and good ol' plain stubborness, I believe
I actually now have something worth using as a research tool for the process of
identifying viruses. it's called:

            DOK-V  DATABASE OF KNOWN VIRUSES -- PC EDITION
                   VERSION 1.00000A1  ALPHA - LEVEL A
                   Copyright (c) 1992 Bits-N-Bytes Computer Services
                   All Rights Reserved

The information compiled in this database, comes from at least a dozen or so
different sources.  However being that the database engine in the first level
of alpha testing i'd like to get opinions from the the other professionals in
the field as well as any other poeple who deal with viruses on a day-to-day
basis, on what they think of it. To try to make things as easy as possible, the
database used is a .dbf format which means any program which can read the Dbase
(R)(TM) .DBF Format (ex. Dbase, Paradox, Quattro Pro, Lotus 1-2-3, etc...) will
be able to read and manipulate this database. I believe there are still quite a
few problems that will need working out being that this is the 1st stand-alone
operational version of DOK-V.  For right now, I only ask this;

  That you try DOK-V and if tell me what you think of it; meaning what yo  thin
  of the arrangement of the information in the program, how easy it is fo  you
  to get to the info you need, and to tell me about any problems you have w th
  DOK-V while you are using it.

as a side note, I've been trying to set DOK-V so that I could upload it to an
FTP site but I've had no luck.  Could someone help me out set up my virus data-
base program DOK-V so that I could upload it to an FTP site. What I have been
doing is using PKzip to compress it. then using uuexe 5.10 to set it up so It
could be uploaded in ZIP format to the mainframe center here, somewhere between
using these two to set it up things go screwy. ( I think I got a bad copy of uu
encode ) :'(  Can someone who more proficient at PC to Mainframe uploading\ dow
loading of binary files please give me a hand?

Subject: Memoirs of a (cross border) virus researcher (CVP)

MEMOIR2.CVP   920930
 
           Memoirs of a (cross-border) virus researcher
 
I suppose different people see me differently.  Some might only notice
my weekly columns.  Some might be more interested in the antiviral
contacts list, or the BBS list.  Some people definitely do not like
the quick reference list of antiviral software.  Many might disagree,
but I see the series of antiviral software reviews as my most
important contribution.
 
There isn't any budget for this.  I do not charge developers for
reviewing their products, and I don't (so far) receive any payment
from users.  However, the costs are not high.  Developers send free
copies of their product, and my only outlay is for the occasional
mailing to request antiviral materials, software and products.  Plus
my time.
 
At least, that's the theory.
 
Bear with me while I digress into politics for the moment.  Since I
started all this, the "Chin-That-Walks-Like-a-PM" has foisted upon us
something called the "Free Trade Agreement".  This is supposed to make
cross border dealing much easier.  In fact, just recently the
government has extended this deal to become the "North American Free
Trade Agreement", covering more ground, doncha know.  This means that
importing and customs are going to be much easier to deal with, as
well as cheaper.
 
At least, that's the theory.
 
So how come this has recently become so very much more difficult and
costly?
 
It used to be that my only worry was someone sending a package via
UPS.  (UPS seems to be congenitally unable to deal with national
boundaries.)  Most courier services seemed to be able to handle it,
although the good old national mail service was often the best bet.
All the developer or publisher had to do was write "evaluation copy,
no commercial value" on the package, and all was well.  I got the
software, and the reviews went forth.  Then we got the GST, and in
spite of there being no commercial value a "service value" had to be
charged.  (What "service value"?  I'm the one providing the service
here, and *I'm* not charging anyone.)  So a fictional (low) service
value has to be put on it, generally reflecting the price of the blank
disks.
 
No longer.  I have here a package from a software developer.  Via US
Mail and then Canada Post.  He has been very careful.  The package
has a customs declaration.  The material is described as "two
diskettes and printed material".  It is described internally as an
"evaluation copy, not for resale or use".  A value of $2 is
declared.  I had to pay $7.98 to receive it.
 
$2.98 is the GST.  GST is seven percent.  Seven percent of $2 is
$0.14.  Ah, but the value for tax is not the $2 declared.  The value
for tax is $42.53.  Where did they get $42.53 from?  I have no idea.
 
Even so, there is still $5 unaccounted for.  Ah, no, here we are. 
$5 "handling fee".  "Handling fee?"  This is the *post office*! 
They are supposed to handle mail!  Or maybe it's the $2.98 GST that
they are charging $5 to handle.  In that case, I didn't ask them to
handle it.  If Revenue Canada wants them to handle the GST, let
Revenue Canada pay the $5 handling fee to collect the $2.98.  Or,
since the $2.98 is a result of "mishandling", the $0.14 that they
should be handling.
 
So much for "free trade".  But then, like the man said, be grateful
you don't get all the government you pay for.
