VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  (The complete set of posting guidelines is available by
FTP on cert.sei.cmu.edu or upon request.) Please sign submissions with
your real name.  Send contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU
(that's equivalent to VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).
Information on accessing anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue
archives is distributed periodically on the list.  A FAQ (Frequently
Asked Questions) document and all of the back-issues are available by
anonymous FTP on cert.org (192.88.209.5).  Administrative mail

Subject: WARNING: New Mac virus (Mac)

		    New Macintosh Virus Discovered
			    30 June 1992

Virus: T4-A, T4-B
Damage: altered boot code; altered/damaged applications
Spread: possibly significant
Systems affected: Apple Macintosh computers. All types, but see text.


A new virus has been discovered, in two slightly different strains.
These were included with the game application GoMoku, versions 2.0 and
2.1.  These files were posted to the Usenet comp.binaries.mac
newsgroup, and uploaded to various ftp archives, including the one at
sumex-aim.stanford.edu. [Note: the game was distributed under a
falsified name. The name used in the posting, and embedded in the
game, is that of a completely uninvolved person.  Please do not use
this person's name in reference to the virus.  The actual virus author
is unknown, and probably used this person's name as a form of
harassment.]

When invoked, the virus attempts to alter the System file.  This
alteration attempt will be noticed by the SAM antivirus program (and
possibly by Gatekeeper, depending on settings).  The alert message
that is displayed indicates that "Disinfectant" is trying to make the
alteration -- whether Disinfectant is installed on the system or not.
This is evidently an attempt to fool users into approving the
modification attempt, thus allowing the virus to infect.

The change to the System file results in alterations to the boot code
under both Systems 6 and 7.  The damage may render some systems
unbootable, but will usually result in INIT files and System
extensions (respectively) not loading.

The virus also attempts to modify application files on the system
disk.  These alterations may damage some applications by overwriting
portions of the programs with the virus code.  These damaged
applications *cannot* be repaired but must be reinstalled from
distribution or backup media.

Once installed and active, the virus does not appear to perform any
other overt damage.  At least one version of the virus may print a
message when run after a certain number of files are infected by it.
This message identifies the infection as the T4 virus.


[Note: Although this note is unrelated to the T4 virus, we feel it
appropriate and important to remind Mac users that neither Apple
System 7 nor 7.0.1 should be used UNMODIFIED because they have the
"disappearing folders" bug.  Users should be sure they have installed
the (free) System Tuner 1.1.1 from Apple on these systems; versions
1.0 and 1.1 of the Tuner are outdated or buggy and should not be used.
Tuner 1.1.1 is available from authorized Apple dealers, from many user
groups, from commercial networks, and on several places on the
Internet.  Also, System 7.0.1 is *not* the same as System 7 with the Tuner
installed; 7.0.1 is a later release of System 7. System 7.0.1 also
needs the update installed.]


Authors of all major Macintosh anti-virus tools are planning updates
to their tools to locate and/or eliminate this virus. Some of these
are listed below. We recommend that you obtain and run a CURRENT
version of AT LEAST ONE of these programs.

If you discover what you believe to be a virus on your Macintosh
system, please report it to the vendor/author of your anti-virus
software package for analysis.  Such reports make early, informed
warnings like this one possible for the rest of the Mac community.

Also, be aware that writing and releasing computer viruses is more
than a rude and damaging act of vandalism -- it is also a violation of
many state and Federal laws in the US, and illegal in several other
countries.  If you have information concerning the author of this or
any other computer virus, please contact any of the anti-virus
providers listed above.  Several Mac virus authors have been
apprehended thanks to the efforts of the Mac user community, and some
are awaiting trial for their actions.  This is yet one more way to
help protect you computers.

From:    Kenneth R. van Wyk <krvw@cert.org>
Subject: IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT - new list address!

To ALL VIRUS-L readers:

Since the first VIRUS-L message was posted on Fri, 22 Apr 1988 at
07:48:39 EDT, a trusty (but rusty) IBM 4381 mainframe computer has
been dutifully distributing all VIRUS-L messages and digests.  This
machine, IBM1.CC.Lehigh.edu (aka LEHIIBM on BITNET), is going to be
going away in the near future.  Not to worry, however, since it is
going to be replaced - by a series of IBM RS/6000 systems running AIX.
This will mean that some changes will occur to the mailing list.  Note
that the comp.virus newsgroup should NOT be affected.  The short term
changes are as follows:

o Next week (6 July 1992), I will be moving all current VIRUS-L
  subscriptions over to the new (UNIX-based) LISTSERV.  When I do
  this, I will lock the old LISTSERV to prevent any new subscriptions
  from being added to the old list.  All such errors will be sent to
  me, and I will deal with them manually (fun fun fun).

o Once the old list is locked, all subscription (addition or deletion)
  requests must go to the new LISTSERV.  The address of the new
  LISTSERV is: LISTSERV@Lehigh.edu.  IMPORTANT: DO NOT SEND ANY
  SUBSCRIPTION REQUESTS TO THAT ADDRESS BEFORE NEXT WEEK; THEY WILL BE
  DELETED.

o Note that some of the user-level commands are going to be somewhat
  different with the new LISTSERV.  If you are not familiar with the
  UNIX LISTSERV that we'll be using, send mail to LISTSERV@LEHIGH.EDU
  saying "HELP".  You will then get a list of valid LISTSERV commands,
  along with some general information.

o VIRUS-L submissions sent to the old LISTSERV will be forwarded to me
  as normal, but this functionality will eventually disappear.
  IMPORTANT: Thus, all VIRUS-L submissions should be sent to
  VIRUS-L@LEHIGH.EDU as of 6 July 1992.

o Note that the new addresses (virus-l@lehigh.edu for submissions,
  listserv@lehigh.edu for LISTSERV requests) are not on BITNET.
  Therefore, BITNET users are going to have to route their e-mail to
  the new Internet addresses.  Contact your site administrators if you
  have questions on how to do this.

o Submissions sent to virus-l@lehigh.edu before I've installed the
  subscription list will be rejected by the new LISTSERV.

As with all new systems, there will no doubt be some teething problems
associated with this switchover.  I would appreciate everyone's
cooperation and patience in dealing with whatever problems arrise.
Duplicating the subscription list, for example, is going to be a
partially manual process, since the two LISTSERVs do not use the same
data formats.  There are bound to be some dropped or otherwise mangled
subscriptions.

Also, there will be further changes related to the switchover.  I will
announce those as they are implemented.

Thanks,

Ken

Subject: Anti-virus recommendatinos for LANs? (PC)

I would like to hear any comments from the network administrators out
there who have used any of the ANTI_VIRUS programs for their networks
specifically.  We are currently pursuing a much more complete solution
to the problem with something like Fifth Generations "Untouchable"
product that was just advertised.

We do have a site license agreement with McAfee for their NETSCAN,
but something that would monitor the network on a consistant basis
is preferred.

I am not aware of a virus called GROOVE, those of us producing or
developing anti-virus products, particularly scanners, can only
develop and test detection for viruses we have samples of.  It sounds
particularly urgent that you forward a sample if it is using an
undetected variation of MtE and/or subverting a-v products.

(Anyone discovering a 'new' virus)

While you are likely to forward a copy to the publisher of your
favourite a-v software, it may be helpful (both to the product
publisher and their users) to send copies to publishers of other
products.  Obviously there is balance to be struck between bypassing
the political barriers that stop some developers exchanging materials
and the artificial proliferation of viruses.

It would be helpful to those researchers that you forward a sample to
to include details of other researchers to whom you have sent samples
and the method employed (email, air mail, etc), so that they can
decide who else to inform.  Providing details such as how you acquired
the virus, whether you still have a problem clearing it up and
observed conditions for infection will help researchers in deciding
how dangerous the virus is and the priority to be given to its
analysis.

If you are a regular reader of comp.virus/virus-l you can probably
find contact details for a number of a-v developers & researchers
fairly easily.  However here are a few that commonly appear, and you
may wish to consider forwarding samples to, (alphabetically):

Well any increase in executable file sizes indicates that a virus infection
is probable.  The sizes quoted, and the additional symptoms of system slow
down & scrolling window, indicate that you have the Jerusalem virus or a
close variant, (also known as "Friday 13th" as it deletes programs as they
are run on any Friday the 13th).

All Windows programs will be corrupted, as will some applications such as
Word Perfect, these must be deleted, later restored from backups or original
disks.  Whether you can 'disinfect' and recover other programs will depend
on the features of the A-V software you are using.

What you should do now is find the MS-DOS/DR-DOS diskette supplied with
your system, hopefully you write-protected it before or at least have done
so now.  (Note MS-DOS 5 upgrade disks are not bootable, which is extremely
stupid & awkward in this situation).

Boot your PC from the DOS diskette, do NOT run any software from the hard
drive, now load Norton Anti-Virus from it's original diskette, (I presume
this was supplied write-protected, if not protect it before use).

If you hear a grinding sound this indicates that the virus is trying to
infect Norton Ant-Virus, this means that your DOS diskette is infected,
(in particular a program called in your AUTOEXEC.BAT, or otherwise run before
before NAV).  I hope that Norton searches system memory and will report
finding Jerusalem virus in memory if it is there.

As Jerusalem virus only infects programs when they are run it should be safe
to scan the hard drive with NAV even if Jerusalem is in memory.  As Jerusalem
is one of the oldest PC viruses all anti-virus scanners should detect it,
unless you a have a new variant.  If NAV doesn't detect the virus you have
several choices: contact Norton/Symantec; get a shareware A-V product from
a reputable archive on the net (eg FPROT); contact a virus researcher with
a copy of an infected file, (I have just posted a list to comp.virus).

Hope this helps, Anthony Naggs

Subject: McAfee 91 versions (particularly VSHIELD) (PC)

There has recently been much confusion regarding the validity of the
91 version of McAfee's antiviral suite, particularly the VSHLD module.

I have found there to be at least two versions of the VSHLD91.ZIP
archive in circulation.  Both contain the McAfee "authentic
verification" envelope, and both are identical with the exception of
the VSHLD91.DOC file.  The older version of the doc file (May 27th)
indicates that VSHIELD.EXE should (via the VALIDATE.COM check) result
in 33DA for check method 2.  The real result, as noted in the later
(May 28th) doc file, is 11CF.

SCANV91.ZIP and CLEAN91.ZIP archives, obtained from the same source as
the "early" VSHLD91.ZIP show no problems.  None of the files show any
sign of tampering, viral infection or "trojanization".

I agree that virus detectors tend not to do a good job of identifying
the viruses, (especially SCAN - but you could say their names are
right and everyone elses are wrong:-).  Of course their main job is to
spot and get rid of viruses, and exact names might not be important
(although I can think of one time when F-Prot and Scan's confusion of
a virus name caused me trouble, and I think neither had it "right").

I presume Vesselin will follow with where to find the reports he has
prepared listing CARO names for viruses plus the names given by some
virus scanners.  Here's a bit of his report (a condensed version of
the start, rather than selected to show just the disagreements, so
reasonably typical of the degree of match between these products)... I
don't know what the latest version of SCAN calls them.

At this point I could mention that I think it is silly for all these
virus detectors to use different names, and how standard names (like
CARO, or my own automatically-generated names) are a good idea, or how
you can get my UPDATED freeware program BOOTID via anonymous ftp from
newton.phys.canterbury.ac.nz [132.181.40.1] in /pub/local to identify
at least boot sectors. Automatically generating names for file
infectors is much harder (well, I can do it, but the name doesn't stay
constant from infection to infection). I suspect that, with the likes
of the Mte, it will be impossible for an automatic namer to work
without at least some knowledge of the engine or a large collection of
viruses that are supposed to be given the same name; the alternative
is automatically generated names that are different for at least some
infections, I expect.

I don't know if it is the same.  From a brief inspection...  This 1530
infects .COM files only, including COMMAND.COM.  At some stage it
writes to the screen (in teletype mode ie int 10h) a message which is
encrypted (not by any complicated method) in the code at the end:

        DataRape! v1.1
        (c)1991 Zodiac
          RABID, USA

Smaller .COMs aren't infected (eg 100 bytes size and less), and when
it infects COMMAND.COM, things slow down noticeably, especially a DIR,
which (at least in DOS 5) requires a few keypresses to get through.
The thing goes TSR whenever an infected COM file is run, and the
memory change is noticeable.  Newly infected COM files increase in
size by about 900 bytes or so.  Anyone know more about this one?

Subject: Memory decrasing 1K (PC)

We have an IBM PS/2 Model 30 in our Department. IBM DOS 5.0 was
installed on it. Recently I tried to install DR DOS 6.0 but memory
decreased 1K. I realized that Dr DOS diskettes carried a virus to the
computer and I decided to reinstall IBM DOS 5.0. We have the original
IBM DOS 5.0 diskettes so I was sure that the problem will be solved.
When I install it the problem remained unchanged. I formatted the disk
(20 MB) and tried reinstall DOS 5.0 but I failed. I scanned the disk
with SCAN91 and it could not find any virus.

Does anyone have any comment ? Is this a kind of virus ?

The Azusa virus as detected by NAV is a boot sector virus which is memory
resident.  A repair is also provided if you are using NAV 2.0.

Although the chance of a false detection exists always, chances that the
Azusa definition in NAV might create a false positive is very small.  The
definition requires approximately 30-some bytes to match exactly and
specifically over a 40-some byte range.

In the time since writing that, another hundred files got infected,
accounting for about all of the .EXE and .COM files on the one hard drive.
I obtained F-PROT which reported that the virus is Enemy, not Scr-2.
Either way, the virus was supposedly unremovable.

I figured out that I could PKUNZIP the files to a 3.5" disk without them
getting corrupted in the process.  So I did that and write-protected the
3.5" disk, then rebooted from a 5.25" (can't boot from B:), then ran the
scanners from the 3.5".  See, just gimme a minute and I'll figure these
things out :)    The scanners didn't detect the virus in memory when
booting from the floppy, whereas they did when booting from the hard drive
even without CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT.

An anonymous tip from another victim of this virus told me that it was
actually neither Scr-2 nor Enemy, but was actually a variant of 696.  He
said (this was relayed through a couple of people, actually) that 696 could
be removed with McAfee Clean.  So... I got Clean and tried it out, like
this:

B:\> clean c:\dos\command.com [696]

It reported that it "Found Scr-2 Virus [696]" and successfully removed it.
A check of the file size showed it was back to normal, so I figured "success!"
and proceeded to work on cleaning up everything on C: drive.

B:\> clean c:
B:\> clean c: /a      <--I did this afterwards to be doubly-sure...

Here's where the new set of problems began.

1. After booting from A: (the 5.25" drive) I had access to A:, B:, and C:,
but not D:, which is the second hard drive.  If I boot from C:, I can access
D:, but not if I boot from A:.  Booting from C: means I get the virus.
Can I access D: after booting from A:?

2. F-PROT assumes that the virus it detects is what is really there.  So
F-PROT was useless to me.  There were no discrepancies between what
files it said were infected and what files McAfee Scan and Clean said
were infected... just what the infection was.  This is a complaint I hope
the F-PROT people will take into consideration... :)

3. F-PROT said I had Enemy, Scan & Clean both said I had Scr-2.  Well,
which is it?  And if it's 696, or something else... agggh.  I heard there
was I place I could send infected files to for diagnosis.  Is there such
a place?  An FTP site maybe?

3. Every time I ran Clean it scanned memory for "critical viruses."  Fine.
But it stopped at 640K.  Why didn't it scan my other 512K?  This is a
complaint I hope the McAfee people... :)

4. Clean successfully removed whatever the virus is from all but about 35
out of 225 files by the above process.  Unfortunately, it took forever to
do, because of what looks like a bug in Clean.  (No, it wasn't infected,
remember, I was running it from the write-protected 3.5" on a system freshly
booted from an uninfected, write-protected 5.25"...)
When Clean would find an .EXE file that it couldn't safely remove the virus
from, it would stop and ask if I wanted to delete it.  No matter what my
answers were it would crash on every THIRD time it encountered one of these
files.  The third time it would tell me it couldn't safely remove it and ask
me for Y/n to delete or not, like the other times.  But if I said yes, it
would say "Sorry, can't re-open file ...".  If I said no, it didn't say
anything.  But whether the answer was yes or no, it would do the same thing:
it went on scanning the rest of the drive (or the rest of the directories and
files specified in the command line) but didn't look at any of the files
like it did before.  It zipped right through and skipped right to the end,
telling me I had x number of files infected, y number disinfected, etc. etc.
It didn't even see the rest of the infected files!!!
So I had to keep running Clean over and over and over to get through all the
files.  Very frustrating.  Anybody have any theories as to why it did this?
McAfee people...? :)

5. Here's the killer.  After getting rid of every un-disinfectable file and
disinfecting the rest, then rebooting and running both Scan and F-Prot to
make sure C: was not infected [D: was not accessed ever], I re-renamed
config.sys and autoexec.bat to their proper names, and rebooted.  (all of
these reboots are cold, by the way)
 My config.sys lists several device drivers, all of which were previously
infected.  Some of them didn't work after disinfection.  First it told me
that \DOS\SETVER.EXE was invalid or missing (not true!) but didn't crash
there.  Then it loaded a few other drivers including GMOUSE.COM without
complaint.  It crashed (hung up entirely) upon loading the Directory
Scanner driver.  Okay, I thought, I don't use DS much, I'll remove that line
from CONFIG.SYS.  Getting that done was a task unto itself.  Eventually I
succeeded and was able to reboot.  This time it crashed after loading
the mouse driver.  Great, I thought, and turned off the computer, flipped
it off (y'know what I mean :), and went to bed.  I haven't touched it
since then.  Next step will be re-scanning, which I'll have done by the
time all of you are still with me get to read this.

6. It occurred to me that there are probably infected Hidden files...
Why aren't these files scanned by any of the programs?

Well, that's about all for now.  I hope somebody can help me.  Please
zing some Email my way if you can.

Thanks,

Mike

Anyhow...I recognize a few of the names..

Scorpio is garbage. It is intended to be a virus, but as far as I can
see it does not replicate, and never will.

Russian Mirror: works ok - a 482 byte virus (Resident, Com files
only), which I have never analysed in detail.

Bad Taste is just one of the many variants of the Murphy virus - not
terribly interesting, 1188 bytes long.

Anti Faggot is based on the Vienna virus, but I have never figured out
why it does not replicate - must be a bug somewhere in the code.

>specific problems that require some better design work.

Let's start with the statement "IT [Cohen's Integrity Toolkit] has
never produced a false positive to my knowledge ...."
  That would seem to depend on what is meant by a "false positive".
If it means the sounding of an alarm by an integrity checker even
though the file has not been *modified*, then the claim is certainly
believable, though hardly significant.  So I shall assume it means
the sounding of an alarm even though the file has not been *infected*.
But under that definition, there are situations (e.g. after replace-
ment of an existing version of a program by a new version, modifica-
tion of setup info in an executable, etc.) in which the great majority
of integrity checkers will give false positives.  True, in *most* such
cases, knowledgable users will be able to identify such situations and
to realize that while there has been a modification, there has not
been a virus infection.

  However, Fred seems to be suggesting that a well implemented integ-
rity checker doesn't require users to make such decisions, and that
the decision process can be fully automated (relative to the values of
policy makers).  I know of one integrity checker which in effect
differentiates automatically between viral infections and other
modifications and does a pretty good job of it, but it isn't perfect
and I doubt that there is any other integrity checker which does as
well (or does it at all).

  Moreover, it is possible to have a virus which exploits this diffi-
culty of differentiation and causes a true positive to masquerade as a
false one, namely a virus which does not infect a file *except when
that file is being modified (or created) by normal means*, so that the
user will think that the modification was solely the result of his own
deliberate actions, and therefore will ignore the alarm.  Examples of
suitable conditions for infection would be during copying of files,
compilation of programs, and formatting of diskettes.

  Unfortunately, integrity checking as such cannot distinguish between
normal modification and infection by such viruses.  (I'm not saying
this could never be done by *any* means; in fact, I'll mention a couple
of methods below which *partially* solve the problem, but it would no
longer be pure integrity checking, at least as I understand the term.)

  When I first thought of such viruses four years ago, I called them
"ambiguity" viruses since they exploit the ambiguity of the situation.
However, when they began to actually appear during the last year or
so (Darth Vader, Compiler and StarShip, though the latter two are not
*pure* ambiguity viruses), they were called "slow" viruses by Vesselin,
since they spread rather slowly.
  In any case, while no program can detect such viruses by modifica-
tion detection alone, fortunately there are some other (partial)
measures which can be taken against them.  Viruses which infect when
files are copied could be caught by comparing the source and target
files after each copy.  However, one would want the comparison to be
performed *immediately* after every copy since the target file might
be on a diskette which is about to be passed on to another computer
(like those which StarShip infects), and there would have to be assu-
rance that the virus wasn't distorting the comparison by stealth tech-
niques.  In the case of viruses (like Compiler) which attack newly
compiled executables, one could adopt the rule of never releasing the
result of a compilation unless it has been performed immediately after
cold booting from a clean diskette (and that the compiler and loader
are also clean).  Unfortunately, there is no solution which is gua-
ranteed to work in all cases of ambiguity viruses and which is not too
inconvenient.  Still, most of us agree anyway (even without the lesson
of ambiguity viruses) that no one anti-viral technique is sufficient
by itself.

(I will ignore the moderator's note since this is going to be a short
reply.)

  It all depends what you mean by "formula".

  (1) Basically, CRC-n is computed by considering the file as a poly-
nomial with coefficients limited to {0,1}, multiplying this by x^n,
dividing the result by a given monic n-th degree "generator" polynomial
using modulo-2 arithmetic, and using the residue as the hash value.
  Translating this into English, it means appending n binary zeros to
the file (considered as a binary number), dividing the result by a
given (n+1)-bit number with leading bit = 1 using "long division"
slightly modified (e.g. subtraction is replaced by XOR), and taking
the remainder as the checksum.

  (2) Here's a simple algorithm, written in a pseudo-high-level
language, which treats the file and the generator (excl. the leading
1-bit) as *bit vectors* F (of length m) and G (of length n), resp.
(C is an auxiliary vector of length n+1):
    For j=1 to n+1 do C(j) := F(j);
    For i=1 to m do {
      K := C(1); For j=1 to n do C(j) := C(j+1) XOR (K AND G(j));
      If i < m-n then C(n+1) := F(i+n+1) else C(n+1) := 0       }
and the n bits of the CRC value are given by the first n bits of
the final value of C.  (Remark: The first statement of the algo-
rithm assumes that m > n; if this is not the case, C must be padded
with zeros.)

  (3) If by "formula" you mean a practical program, that's another
matter ....
