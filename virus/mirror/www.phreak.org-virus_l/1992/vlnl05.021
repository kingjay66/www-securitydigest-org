News Release

		 DaVinci Discovers Michelangelo Virus
		  Warns users of possible infection

RALEIGH, North Carolina, February 1, 1992 - DaVinci Systems announced
today that a recent shipment of eMAIL 2.0 demonstration disks and
30-day kits may be infected with a computer virus known as
Michelangelo.  Approximately 900 customers and potential customers
were sent the infected disks.  Of these, over 600 were DaVinci
resellers.

DaVinci Systems immediately notified its resellers of the problem via
electronic mail and will mail a new set of disks to all recipients of
the infected disks by February 6th.  DaVinci Systems also advises
anyone who has received a DaVinci eMAIL 2.0 demo disk or 30-day kit
between January 20, 1992 and January 31st, 1992 not to use the disks
they received.

According to Bill Nussey, President of DaVinci Systems, "While there
is only a slim chance of one of our customers contracting the
Michelangelo virus from these disks, we wanted to take every possible
precaution."

The Michelangelo virus sits passively on infected machines until March
6th (Michelangelo's Birthday) when it corrupts data on a user's hard
disk.  FORTUNATELY, THE VIRUS CAN ONLY BE CONTRACTED BY BOOTING UP AN
INFECTED FLOPPY.  Because the infected disks are not bootable, most
users who have received these diskettes will not contract the virus on
their machine even if they run the demo or install the software on
their hard disks.  The only way users could catch the virus from an
infected disk is if they inadvertently boot up their computers with
the infected floppy in driver A while the drive door is closed.

DaVinci officials are still investigating the source of the virus.
Although DaVinci's master disks are routinely checked for viruses, the
virus software used apparently did not detect Michelangelo.  "We are
now using multiple virus-detection products and insisting that our
duplicating contractors also check for viruses", said Nussey.

The Michelango virus can be detected by Microcom's Virex version 2.l1
or later or by McAfee Associates shareware program VIRUSCAN version
7.9v84 or later.  DaVinci users and resellers can download VIRUSCAN
from DaVinci's BBS at (919) 881-4342.

Based in Raleigh, North Carolina, DaVinci Systems Corporation is the
leading independent supplier of LAN-based electronic mail
applications.  The company's products run under acknowledged personal
computer network and operating system standards such as MS-DOS,

Subject: More infected floppies from vendors (PC)

This is getting silly. Then again it indicates that a real understanding
of the architecture is not a prerequisite for success in vending software.

What has happened is that the vendors do not know what the disks they are
sending out are supposed to look like. This is understandable since there
is an incredible number of disk formats since every formatter puts in
Boot Record (and MBR for that matter) code that is different from
everyone elses.

This was part of the reason I developed the FREEWARE SafeMBR and SafeFBR
code, so that I could take a quick look at the code from a clean machine
and determine that it has not changed. Since the boot records of all my
floppies are the same (other than the four different BPBs), it makes for
an easy check whenever a floppy is put in the drive.

Nonwithstanding the anti-viral aspect, when a vendor prepares a distribution
disk, statistical sampling should permit a quick scan and comparison with
a "gold copy" cryptographic checksum. For some time, it has been my belief
that Scanners are best used for identifying a problem, not in the first
notice that there is a problem.

Since we have now reached the point at which floppies are not expected to
have bad sectors (I do not use any that do), the FATs and Programs on a
disk and their locations should be stable in a duplication process. Given
a stable Boot Record, then all distributed disks should be mirror images of
each other. At this point normal statistical sampling should be sufficient
for integrity management.

What I do not understand is why the vendors refuse to acknowlege this - I
would think that it would be a selling point. Not only would this make it
very difficult for viruses to spread, the incidences of corrupt files on
distribution disks (have been receiving quite a few lately) would be
sharply reduced. It would also provide a defense against claims of "shrink-
wrapped" viruses though more vendors seem to be picking up on "notchless"
floppies.

Maybe that's why I am not a vendor.

					Warmly,
						Padgett

Subject: Campana virus: how to cure it (PC)

My PC is apparently infected by a virus. The symptom: most of the
time floppy disks formatting fails and when it succeeds,  a dir
command shows very odd caracters.

I was told that this virus might be Campana. Norton anti-virus, which
I purchased last October, does not detect it. It is not the the viri
list anyway.

Does anyone has an idea on how I could get rid of it. May be there is
some freeware virus checker which could do the job. I'm not familiar
at all with the PC stuff, especially for downloading software. If
anyone recommends a program, can I download it on my Mac and then save
it in DOS format via Apple File exchange?

Thanks in advance for your help.

I've  also  noted  one  other  response to  Kathy's question that was of a
similar  nature.   It  seems  to me that BOTH respondees missed the thrust
of what she was asking.

While  it is true that AUX is another  name for COM1 what  we are  dealing
with  is a logical HANDLE.  What she  is  ASKING  about is  the  existence
of  numerous FILES which carry the  name AUX - and I believe  that that is
             ^^^^^
an  entirely  different matter.  I don't know the answer to  her  question
(sorry  Kathy)  but  it  seems that answers are  occurring to people based
on a faulty reading of same.

  What meager knowledge I've obtained to this point tells me that all of
  these device drivers are memory resident!   I see NO REASON AT ALL for
  numerous 112 byte FILES to've been created residing in EVERY directory
  (including all sub, sub sub, and sub sub ... etc ones?  Ohmygawd!!) of
  (what I presume is) Kathy's hard drive!

Pardon  any misunderstandings on  my part but I feel that those of you who
are trying to help those of us with lesser knowledge (and we DO appreciate
it, believe me!) should try to be sure that you are answering the question
we ASKED,  not the question you that you've ASSUMED that we asked  (due to
a too quick read?).  I'm very interested in  knowing  what  WOULD  cause a
proliferation of 112 byte files that would appear to be redundant.

                                         Thanks for reading,

Gateway 2000s come with an AnyKey Keyboard that allows you to redefine
the keyboard with macros.  You're description sounds like someone
redefined the space bar to enter the above characters instead of a
blank space.  The fact that you can the backspace over them may
support this.  Has anyone had the opportunity to mess around with his
computer?  I've accidently redefined a key on my keyboard, though it
doesn't sound like the above would be accidental.

      When you run CHKDSK under Dos 3.3 on a PS/2, shouldn't the

The Pentagon "virus" is not a real virus - for a simple reason - it
simply doesn't work...never has, and never will.

However, if it was found on a diskette, I see two possible explanations

    False alarm - (very likely) A problem in v69 that was corrected later

    New and updated version of the virus - (highly unlikely)

Frankly, I wouldn't worry to much about this...

If your computer isn't that important,and/or you have all stuff backed
up, try setting the file privs for those programs in Gatekeeper. If
your computer goes crazy,at least you're not in the dark anymore. You
may simply have an error in your Gatekeeper INIT,it may be
incompatible with a new program or init/cdev,if you have just
installed one. Or it could simply be a hardware problem... I have not
heard of any viruses that would do something like that... It may be a
new strain? (shrug)

One Amiga virus which caused many problems here in Holland was/is the Saddam
virus, which can infect memory as soon as you insert an infected disk (are
Amiga viruses more advanced than PC viruses? ;-). I use VirusChecker
by John Veldthuis to protect, and in conjunction with FixDisk to wipe it off.

Personally, I had no real problems with it, but many beginners in my
computerclub still have...
