Hmm, problem is, since version 91 SCAN is -very- unreliable in
identifying viruses. For instance, it calls "1530 [1530]" the
following viruses, some of which are completely unrelated:

	Dark_Avenger.1530
	Dark_Avenger.Father
	Dark_Avenger.1028
	Eastern_Digital
	Hymn.Hymn
	Hymn.Sverdlov
	Murphy.Brothers
	Rape.500
	Rape.747
	Rape_II
	SVC.5_0.C

Hmm, F-Prot 2.05 detects all of the above... Seems that you have a new
variant. I suggest that you send a copy to Frisk.

Sounds like a Dark_Avenger variant to me... Beware, most of the
Dark_Avenger viruses are very destructive!

Yes, I noticed that too. Seems like a bug to me. If you setup your
system with the country code for Germany (049) and then start the
program (and if you don't have the German language modules), F-Prot
will display a window saying (in German) that a German version of the
product is available. At the bottom line of this window, you can see
the percentage counter for the memory scan. I have to verify whether
the pure-English version of the product actually scans the memory
(without displaying a counter) or does not perform memory scan at
all...

Haven't tried this. Also seems like a bug to me, unless it is a

That's normal, there's no file USER.DEF in the distribution package,
so the installation program does not try to copy it. It is created by
the user and it is the responsibility of the user to take care of it.

I am evaluating McAfee and Central Point Anti-Virus as part of a

similar comparison between the 2 products. I would appreciate if you
could e-mail me a copy your reports. From the limited testing that I
have done, it comes down to cost and frequency of upgrades for McAfee
and ease of use for CPAV.

Any help would be appreciated

Dos 5's Format.Com does indeed have the -stack!- string repeated in it
a number of times. The size of the file is 33087 bytes and the CRC-32
for the file is 2087080915 Dec or 7C6653D3 hex.

I must respectfully disagree. Every version of DOS since then
including DOS 5.0 provides a method for validating the original Int
13h vector.

Personally, I use a program that runs before DOS (from the BIOS level)
to check it and it is posible to plant a vector flag in memory that
would be impervious to all but a specifically directed attack (and
even that is detectable)

Unless Andy has a different version of Dos 5 to mine then I think he
really might have a problem. My copy is not PkLited, nor are any of
the Dos 5 files for that matter, nor does FP-205 report any infection.
Backup.Exe is 36092 bytes and the CRC-32 is 5591A20A hex.

Dr. Cohen's equations, given in his paper, are slightly different. See

Ummm... I disagree... I'll give the secure settings here (quoted from
Dr. Cohen's paper) and invite everybody to check whether their LAN is
set in a secure way. You'll be surprised how many of them are not...

In Edinburgh somebody from Novell quoted a public domain NLM that
performs integrity checks. As far as I understand, it will be possible
to subvert it by using any of the attacks against integrity checking
programs, described in my paper, but nevertheless I would like to give
it a try. It was reported to be available through CompuServe.
Unfortunately, I forgot its name... (Was it NETCHECK?) Has anybody
heard about this utility and could any kind soul make it available for
us ftp users?

Oh, and BTW, where is NETSHIELD available from? It wasn't on Simtel20
the last time I checked... (Please reply by private e-mail to this
question. I know that somebody posted the location some time ago, but
I lost the message... :-()

Hmm, why do you classify VSHield as an integrity TSR? Because you can
instruct it to check for the validation codes added by SCAN? This is a
bit forced, IMHO... VShield is mainly a resident scanner and is rather
far from a resident integrity checker...

Well, in our (probably faulty) educational system in Bulgaria, we are

Correct. This is one of the equations for secure settings, described
in Dr. Cohen's paper. (In ASCII I would denote it as "~S.~A.~M.Ro.)

For the companion viruses, see below.

Correct, this the second equation in the paper. (~S.~W.~A)

As you have pointed out, this includes protection against a virus
which knows about Novell NetWare and which can modify the
rights/attributes of the protected files, if the protection allows
that. If we restrict ourselves to the currently existing viruses only,
we get that ~S.(~F+~R+~W) is sufficient. (That is, NOT SUPERVISOR AND
ANY OF THE FILESCAN, READ, WRITE RIGHTS TURNED OFF.)

(Note that all the equations in this article are just quoted from Dr.
Cohen's paper; they have not been verified by my yet.)

In order to stop the companion viruses (more exactly, the regular
companions), you need to prohibit Modify, AccessControl, Create, and
Supervisor rights. Thus, combining the first two equations with this
requirement, we get the following settings for a secure installation:

	~S.~M.~A.~C.(~W+Ro)

That is: NOT SUPERVISOR AND NOT MODIFY AND NOT ACCESS CONTROL AND NOT
CREATE AND EITHER NOT WRITE OR THE READONLY ATTRIBUTE SET TO ON, OR
BOTH. Now, how many of the exiting LANs based on Novell NetWare are
set up in this way? And how many of the Novell LAN supervisors who are
reading this forum could figure out that the above are the -only-
secure settings themselves?

BTW, the above settings still leave the door wide open for a
PATH-companion attack. The exact attack is described in the improved
version of my paper, which I'll make available for anonymous ftp later
today (shameless plug). Fortunately, such infections cannot spread
between users.

Oh, and one last note. The above equations hold for the EFFECTIVE
access rights. That is, the rights that are effective after you take
into account all inheritance masks.

As Padgett said, in order to be able to do something under Novell, you
must have the Rights that permit you to do it, and not have any
Attributes that forbid you to do it. So, neither the Rights override
the Attributes, nor vice versa. They just complement themselves in a

This is a very key observation! It holds for all multi-user
environments, which provide discretionary access controls. It is
exactly this fact, which allows the viruses to spread in those
environments, regardless of the discretionary access controls. It is
not a Novell-specific problem, it's a general security issue.

  I doonu if there is a virus that clears CMOS but I've experimented
  that QEMM 6.02 is able to do it!!! Installing QEMM first times I've
  got many and many probs and at the end my computer locked up!
  I'm never able to enter CMOS setup! I must use jumper for resetting
  CMOS parameters then everything gone right! So I think there is a way
  to do it! If you think I've failed in something plz tell me. Bye

Subject: HELP!! Something is DELETING my files!!! HELP!! (UNIX)

I'm wondering if there's some sort of virus in emacs (or a
lisp-package). Or if there's a SERIOUS BUG in emacs.

I was happily reading my mail with VM, when I wanted to take a look at
the News. I use GNUS for News Reading. When I started up GNUS, I
realised that some of my files were missing:

          - ~/.newsrc
          - ~/.newsrc.el
          - ~/.mailrc

and all backup-files of these files.

This is the FIFTH TIME this happened in two or three days!! So I won't
accept that it's something I've done wrong.

Have anyone else experienced this??

I think it could be something with GNUS, VM, Mail or RMAIL in emacs.

I'm using an HP9000/720 with HP-UX 8.07, and my emacs version is
18.58.6.

PLEASE HELP!!!

AIX 3.2 has a virus checker built-in (/usr/bin/virscan). Check out the
man page in Info.

Stealth Bomber 2.2 should be available from several sites via
anonymous FTP (I've been off VIRUS-L for a while so I don't remember
where exactly).  Stealth Bomber is a set of C- and Pascal-callable
routines that perform a CRC check on the running program and do a
system check for any suspicious behaviour related to stealth viruses.
If you have trouble finding it, drop me a note and I'll send you a
UU-encoded copy via mail.

HISVIRA.CVP   920903
 
                       MacMag virus - part 1
 
(I know that nobody is going to believe the fact that my schedule of
columns for this series was set months ago.  No one is going to
believe my protestations that I have not been swayed by the recent
news reports of the charges against Richard Brandow (they were
right, I was wrong, that's how you spell it) so I simply won't make
any.  In any case, it's Canadian Content time.)
 
On February 7, 1988, users of Compuserve's Hypercard Forum were
greeted with an intriguing warning message.  It told them that the
NEWAPP.STK Hypercard stack file was no longer on the system.  The
notice suggested that if they had downloaded the file, they should
not use it.  If they had used it, they should isolate the system the
file had run on.
 
The story, on Compuserve, had actually started a day earlier.  A
user had earlier downloaded the same Hypercard stack from the Genie
system, and noticed, when he used it, that an INIT resource had been
copied into his system folder.  (In the Mac world, this generally
means that a program is executed upon startup.  Many of these
programs are "background" utilities which remain active during the
course of the session.)  The user, noticing that this same file was
posted on Compuserve, had put up a warning that this file was not to
be trusted.
 
The moderator of the Forum initially downplayed the warning.  He
stated that there was no danger of any such activity, since
Hypercard "stacks" are data files, rather than programs. 
Fortunately, the moderator did check out the warning, and found that
everything happened as the user had said.  Furthermore, the INIT
resource was "viral": it spread to other "systems" that it came in
contact with.  (At that time "system" disks were more common among
Mac users, as "bootable" disks were among MS-DOS users.)  The
moderator apologized, posted the warning, and a number of people
started looking into the structure of the virus.
 
The virus appeared to be benign.  It attempted to reproduce until
March 2, 1988.  When an infected computer was booted on that date,
the virus would activate a message that "RICHARD BRANDOW, publisher
of MacMag, and its entire staff would like to take this opportunity
to convey their UNIVERSAL MESSAGE OF PEACE to all Macintosh users
around the world."  A laudable sentiment, perhaps, although the
means of distribution was unlikely to promote a "peaceful, easy
feeling" among the targeted community.  Fortunately, on March 3 the
message would appear once and then the virus would erase itself.
