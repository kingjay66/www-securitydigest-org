Subject: Plastique Virus... (PC)

Hi everybody!
We have trouble with a virus whose name is PLASTIQUE.
I think it infect both .EXE and .COM files and place itself to FAT.
Once a file infected, then it does not working and operating
system (or virus itself) gives
"Sector not found..."
or
"File allocation table error on drive...."
errors.
Also, it doesn't possible to copy it.
After this information, does anybody know where can we get
an antivirus program which remove this virus from our PCs.

Thanks in advance...

Ooops, I published the address incorrectly. Mea culpa, sorry. The
correct name of the file is ccc91.zip, it is on
ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de [134.100.4.42], in the /pub/virus/texts
directory. Please note that we have only one (and quite slow) modem,
so I'll appreciate if the file is made available on more popular
archive sites as well. One more time sorry for the confusion.

I didn't express myself clearly enough, sorry. My arguments were
mainly against the generic disinfection, regardless how it is
implemented. I agree that keeping the information in a database is
much more correct than to attach it to the files, but I still claim
that generic disinfection is impossible in the general case (even if
using only the currently known infection techniques, and maybe even
with the currently existing viruses). Any, yes, I know that The
Untouchable does not destroy files when it tries to disinfect them,
since it checks whether the repaired file will have the same checksum
as the originals.

The device drivers (usually stored in files with SYS extension)
contain executable code, just as the COM and EXE files. They can even
be of the two possible types - COM-type device drivers, and EXE-type
device drivers. Well, to be exact, they have a somewhat special
header, but it is well documented in the manuals and anybody who
bothers to read them can figure out how to write a device driver
infector.

It is arguable whether a device-drivers infecting virus will have any
chance to spread only, but nobody said that it must infect only device
drivers... One could (in fact several people already did) write a
virus, which infects both EXE & COM files and device drivers... In
fact, it could infect boot sectors, partition tables, OBJ files,
libraries, etc...

There have been device drivers infecting viruses since more than two
years - the Happy New Year (Bulgarian) was the first one, but it's not
so easy to make it infect device drivers, so several people haven't
noticed that. Currently I can recall at least about two other device
drivers infecting viruses, both of Russian origin - SVC 6.0 and
Starship. Yet, I know only about one virus scanner, which checks the
device drivers properly - the Dr. Alan Solomon's AntiVirus ToolKit.

Hope the above helps.

Vesselin

The package includes the program in question, so you can read it
without problems. If you read it -carefully-, you'll see the
explanation why Patti switched to hypertext versions (hint: look at
the Revision History entry). Although I would like to be able to print
porions of it into files in plain-text mode, without using dirty
tricks and printer redirection...

Hmm, sounds more like a hardware problem, or a corrupted DOS... (No
problem to write a virus, which does the same, of course, but I don't
think this is your case. And it's certainly not because of SCAN /AV.
You could remove the checksums with SCAN /RV and check whether the
problems disappears. Another advise, boot from a clean DOS system disk
and perform a SYS on your hard disk (or use Norton's "make disk
bootable", if the version of your SYS is not smart enough). No
guarantees, but the problem may disappear. Also try CHKDSK and watch
for any reports about corrupted files...

Subject: Possible Virus, Help!! (PC)

I was working on a friends Gateway 2000 386SX-20 MHz computer this
weekend, when every time I hit the space bar on the keyboard. It stops
taking input from the keyboard, but the computer types out TUMARC FROM
CHINA on the screen and beeps for about 3 to 4 minutes. It then stops
and leaves the text on the screen. I can backspace it off the screen,
but as soon as I hit the spacebar again it does it again. I asked my
friend when it started doing this to him. He replied that it started
doing it a little while after installing Calender Creater Plus,
AddressBook, and one other program from Power-Up software. I am
wondering if anyone out there has heard of this problem or virus. I
looked in McAfee's virus list and it is not listed, so I am wondering
if this a new virus that has not yet been seen. If anyone has any
suggests at all please send me e-mail. Thanks!!!

Various words, including "aux", "con" and "prn", are reserved device
names in DOS.  If you try to do anything with them as though they were
files, various odd and unexpected things can happen.  "aux" actually
tells DOS to read to / write from the serial port; if the right sort
of device were hooked up there, it might actually work, although I
haven't heard of anyone doing it.  "con" tells DOS to treat the
keyboard/screen (the "console") as a file; this can be very useful (as
in COPY CON: TEST.JNK), but many editors will get very confused when
faced with "edit con".  Or "edit aux".  For more info, see the index
of most DOS manuals, under "device names".

Probably not a virus!   *8)

Subject: F-PROT/CPAV conflict (PC)

A user of F-PROT 2.02 just reported a conflict between that program and the
Central Point anti-virus program:

It seems that "Secure Scan" reports:

    VSAFE.SYS  Infection: New or modified variant of Flip
    VWATCH.SYS  Infection: New or modified variant of Flip

This means that both FLIP signatures are found in the program, but it does not
appear to be a normal infected file - perhaps a new variant.

Actually, this is a false alarm, caused by the fact that the folks at CP
use the same signatures as I do, and they do not store them in encrypted form
in the file - something any decent anti-virus program should do... :-)

So, if you get this particular message on these files don't worry...I'll do
something about this in the next version, although I really consider this
to be CP's problem....

Subject: very strange Mac behavior (Mac)

Hello -

I've got a Mac IIsi, system 6.0.7, that's behaving very strangely:

- - When anyone tries to access the Page Setup or Print functions from
just about any application, Gatekeeper says that the application is
trying to violate res(system) privileges against the System -
RsrcMapEntry(DRVR2).

- - The Mac was working perfectly happpily until a few days ago; the
user doesn't know of any changes that were made.  (But this is a
semipublic machine)

- - Some applications also trigger the warning when loading or when
trying to open a document.

- - Disinfectant 2.5.1 sees nothing wrong.

Has anyone seen this sort of this thing before?  I don't want to raise
the virus alarm prematurely; It's possible that something's been
corrupted by other means.

Oh yeah - replacing the System file and printer drivers doesn't change
anything.

Thanks for your help.

The signature virus is a joke.  You will note, on those sigblocks that
have it, the note "append me to your sig file".

It is strikingly similar to the "classified ads" virus.  The one that

DEFMTH8.CVP   920126

                     The "Commercial Safety" Myth

If I had to choose one viral myth which most contributed to the
unchecked spread of viral programs that exists today, it would be that
of the "safety" of commercial software.  Although there is little
agreement as to actual numbers, most virus researchers would agree with
the statement that the vast majority of viral infections are caused by
viri which are both easy to detect and easy to remove.  Yet one recent
survey of 600,000 PCs indicated that 63% had been hit with an infection. 
Why?  Easy.  Only 25% had any kind of protection against viri.  (Note -
even more disturbing - *at least* 48% *have been hit and STILL HAVE NOT
TAKEN PRECAUTIONS!*)

I am often faced with the assertion from computer users that, "Oh, I
don't need to worry about viruses.  *I* only use *commercial* software. 
If it doesn't have shrink wrap, it doesn't go into *my* computer!"  This
statement, and feeling of false security, relies on three assumptions:
1) that shareware is a major viral vector, 2) commercial software is
never infected, only shareware and pirate software are and 3) there are
no viral vectors other than software.

Although shareware has been involved in the spread of viral programs, it
is difficult to say how much of a role that it plays.  In nine years of
involvement with the local and extended communications community, I have
not yet downloaded a file which I found to contain a viral program
infection.  (Except for the ones that were sent to me as such.)  Note
that I am not making any claims to superior knowledge or expertise here:
my random sampling of interesting looking files off the nets and boards
has yet to pull in one which is infected.  Others say otherwise,
although it was interesting to note, in a recent conversation where
someone to the opposing view, that he finally had to admit he'd never
downloaded an infected file either.  In fact, for many years, shareware
antivirals were the only reasonable form of protection.

Every major microcomputer operating system except CP/M has had at least
one instance of a major commercial software vendor distributing infected
programs or media.  They take precautions, of course, but apparently
still don't give virus checking a high enough priority.

Besides which, there are other possibilities for obtaining viral
infections from "commercial" sources.  Most commercial software is still
distributed on writable media.  Software retailers will often accept
"returned" software, re-wrap it (shrink wrapping is easy to do) and
resell it - often without checking for any incidental infection. 
Hardware or system retailers are all too often selling infected systems
these days, not knowing or caring that they are doing so.
