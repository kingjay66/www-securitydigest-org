Subject: Stoned Help! (PC)

My PC (SONY-QuatarL, IBM competible) was infected by Stoned.
MacAfee's SCAN 6.9V75 told me "the partition table contains Stoned".
However, neither
	scan /d
nor
	clean
do anything for me.

Could anybody tell me how to detect it?

Many thanks in advanced.

Subject: FORM in mem (PC)

Hello there,

I discovered something strange ; I booted from a perfectly clean
system.  Then I asked the directory of disk that was infected by FORM.
After that I let Scan 86b search my memory for viruses and it said
that FORM was active in memory.

How come that a virus is active after just reading the directory list ?
( for your information ; FORM is a bootsector virus )

Hi,

I ran f-prot and it came up with vsafe.sys and vwatch.sys (both from
Central Point Anti Virus) being infected with a new or modified
varient of FLIP.  Is it normal for these programs to show up as
infected or is this a bonna fide infection that I picked up
somewhere??

The following is a forwarded message from John McAfee:

                           VIRUS ALERT

    Three new viruses have appeared in the past two months that
utilize the Bulgarian Dark Avenger Mutation Engine.  The source
code for this mutation engine has appeared on numerous virus-
exchange bulletin boards and is now in the hands of virus writers.
The source code can be compiled and linked with any .COM file-
infecting virus, thus making the virus undetectable to any string-
based scanning technique.

     Since stealth viruses and other viruses designed to avoid
filter- or CRC-checking- type anti-virus programs can be altered
using the mutation engine, this poses a real threat to current
security systems.  If a virus is specifically designed to avoid
memory-resident filters, and also cannot be caught by a scanner,
then there will be no protection against it.


    The three mutating viruses discovered so far are the Pogue,
Fear, and Dedicated viruses.  The Pogue has already been reported
and confirmed in the public domain in the U.S and Norway.  We have
unconfirmed reports from other countries.

    Version 86 of SCAN detects the Pogue virus but does not contain
a detector for other mutating viruses.  Version BETA89 of SCAN has
just been released that does contain an algorithmic-based detector
for all viruses mutated with the Dark Avenger Mutation Engine.  The
production version will be available March 20.  No versions of SCAN
prior to version 86 will be able to detect any virus mutated by the
mutation engine.

End of forwarded message.  If you have any questions, please direct them
to John McAfee directly at telephone 1-(408) 988-3832 or by fax 1-(408)

Subject: Is this a virus? (PC)

Last night I was working on my 286 AT clone at home, when I did a
command which corresponds to an executable in a utilities directory in
my search path, and my machine responded with 'bad command or file
does not exist' error message. I thought this was curious, to I went
to the directory and did a 'dir' and got a list of some files, and
then followed by a bunch of garbed junk! This was repeatable every
time I tried to look at the directory (and all directories it turned
out)!

I rebooted the machine and then the problem went away. Has anyone out
there seen this problem? I used SCAN and it didn't detect any thing.
Any clues?

(I hope this isn't some new virus going around :( I have been planning
on reformatting my hard disk anyways, so maybe this is a good time to
do it :)

GR> -=[ "Information is the greatest weapon of power to the modern wizard." ]=-

Unfortunately, it is dangerous to put a gun in the hands of a child, as
you have aptly demonstrated.  By posting the scan codes that McAfee uses
for common viruses, you have assured us (the rest of the world) that in
short order, a slew of 'old' viruses with these codes changed will
sprout up to annoy everyone.

GR>    Recently I began to wonder about the usefulness of 'virus scanners'
GR>and what if any difference do they have with a simple text/hex search
GR>program (like nortons filefind/ts). An if there was no real DIFFERENCE,
GR>how secure is the system that used them.

Two important differences are their storage of virus strings and
checking memory.  By storing the virus signatures encrypted, even at a
basic level of bit shifting, one scanner program will not 'detect'
another.  Your hex search program would find itself infected, because
it found the signature in its code.

Most scanners also check memory before they start to scan.  Your hex
searcher will spread viruses like Dark Avenger like wildfire by not
checking memory before searching.

GR>    What I found out was scan was just a simple hex searcher (that kept
GR>its data locked up till needed). It could also be fooled by any program

You were expecting maybe a computerized Sherlock Holmes?  What else is a
virus SCANNER to do but SCAN for known viruses.

GR>    So it seems my question was answered. Some 'virus scanners' just scan
GR>for a single string of hex character. This is fine if viruses NEVER changed
GR>or programs would NEVER use code similar to what a virus would (the smaller

Viruses don't change, people change them.  While this may seem like a
trivial statement, it is important.  This is why a program scans for
'variants' of viruses, and one reason that updates are so frequent is
because people have nothing better to do with their time than change
virus code to make its 'signature' different.

GR>    One thing that I think is a good idea is when a program allows users
GR>to add new footprint data to it (like nortons' virus package). For now

Correct me if I am wrong, but McAfee works this way too.  It has the
option of using external codes, so that any hex string can be searched
for.  Also, the license you get from McAfee is for one year (I believe)
which gives you as many updates as there are for that year.  This to me
is quite reasonable, due to the number/frequency of updates.

Subject: Recovery from a New Zealand Strike? (PC)

Thanks to the Michelangelo scare, we've been uncovering lots of other
viruses here at the University of Chicago.  The most recent call was
about one called New Zealand.  The details I've got are a little
sketchy.  I was talking to a rather distraught user over the phone who
knew very little about her machine.  It seems that she scanned her
drive with an old verson of IBM's VIRSCAN and it informed her that it
was infected with New Zealand.  What she did at this point is unclear.
She thinks she did something wrong.  The next clear thing I got out of
her was that the screen went blank and she restarted the computer.
Now it won't boot from the hard drive and she can't see the hard drive
when she boots from a floppy.

I've been told that New Zealand is a nasty virus much like
Michelangelo and Stoned.  I'm looking for some more info on it.  More
than that though, I'm looking for information on recovering from a
strike.  Possible?  I'm going to talk to her more but I would bet lots
of money that she doesn't have backups.

thanks,

Subject: re: Protection from boot-sector viruses (PC)

Roger,

Your boot sector virus protection system makes sense, as far as it
goes.

With a little extra effort, you could extend the protection to cover
"stealth" viruses as well.  Here's how:

For each PC, determine where is the ROM code which services int13
to load the MBR into memory during the boot process.  Then use
that code in your VET program instead of calling INT13 to read
the MBR.  i.e:

ROMINT13 LABEL DWORD
dw 0????h
dw 0F000h

  PUSHF                            ; use this instead of INT 13h
  CALL DWORD PTR [ROMINT13]

As long as memory address space for F000:???? is not re-mapped
into RAM (e.g. by QEMM etc), then the virus cannot corrupt it,
and you know you're getting what you asked for.  You can test for
this by trying to write to that memory and see if it changes.
( Save the original contents to write back in case it does
change ).

How do you find the Int13 entry point?  Simple, really.  Use
DEBUG to search system ROM for typical int13 code, and try it:

C:>DEBUG

- - s f000:0 l FFFF 80 FA 80

look at the first offset reported, and back up a byte (or two) if
the preceeding bytes are FB (or FC).  That will be your entry
point.  Un-assemble the code to make sure it looks like an
int13 service routine, then try it.

Another (sure-fire) way is to write a small machine-code program
to replace the boot sector of a diskette.  This program just
grabs the Int13 vector (before DOS or any virus can change it)
and displays it on the screen.  Boot off this diskette, write the
value down, remove the special diskette, and re-boot the PC. Voila.

Subject: Michelangelo ... just for the record (PC)

Dear list readers,

Just for the record and maybe spreading statistics:

At the Medical Faculty of the Erasmus University Rotterdam we had an
isolated case of Michelangelo infections. 5 AT-type IBM-PC clones were
infected with the Michelangelo virus. All have 5.25 inch 1.2 Mb
A:-drives (this confirms the statement of J.P. van der Landen, made
earlier on this list). The infections were found at a routine scanning
performed regularly on these PC's. Michelangelo was cleaned after cold
floppy-boot as recommended. Software used was our site- licensed
McAfee anti-virus package version 86B. Also the diskettes in the
department were scanned, and they found 10 of them infected, all 5.25
inch 1.2 Mb. Cleaning was no problem. All this happened two weeks ago
from now. At 6 march we had no problems with Michelangelo at this
department and no disasters were acknowledged at the whole university.

We are happy to be serviced by the virus-l list with warnings
concerning this lousy virus!

Subject: Stoned/Michelangelo/etc overwriting partition (PC)

I saw reports here of file damage left by Stoned infection.

If my memory serves, we have some hard drives that were formatted with
the first partition starting on the second logical sector of the hard
drive.  They were partitioned by Zenith's PART that came with a Zenith
DOS 2.xx version, I think.  Certainly FAT's would be corrupted when
Stoned or Michelangelo or some other MBR viruses infect such a disk,
since the 7th logical sector gets overwritten at infection time with
the original MBR.

Questions:

1. Do CLEAN and F-PROT and NORTON and friends check for matching 1st
and 2nd FATs when they disinfect these viruses, offering to copy 2nd
FAT to first?  (The damage is almost certainly in the 1st FAT, unless
the disk is like a 10Mb with 8K clusters).  Same question for
floppies, really, since sector 3 would usually be in the 1st FAT, too,
ain't?

2. Can it be relied on that FDISK or PART with newer DOS (like ver
3,4,5) would start the partition later on the disk (18th logical
sector is what seems more "normal", so sector 1 of head 1 of cylinder
0)?  So re-paritioning might reliably prevent file damage by
infection?

3. Assuming only DOS lives on the disk, are there other common reasons
for curruption of files when Stoned, Michelangelo, etc (strictly MBR)
viruses infect?

4. Has somebody out there got a simple "vulnerable to Stoned file
damage" testing program that reports the logical sector number of the
start of the 1st partition?  FDISK doesn't quite tell everything you
want to know about your partitions.

I guess I can answer 4 myself.  Padgett's FIXMBR can tell you: (It
dumps the partition table on the screen).  It shows 4 rows of 16
2-digit hex bytes.  Mine (2 DOS partitions) looks like:
	80 01 01 00 04 05 51 98 11 00 00 00 E5 A2 00 00
	00 00 41 99 04 05 D1 31 F6 A2 00 00 F6 A2 00 00
	00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
	00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
Read off starting sectors       ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^  from 8th-11th byte of each row.
	                        11 00 00 00
	                        F6 A2 00 00
Hex, 32 bits, least significant bytes first, so 1st partition starts at
logical sector 11H = 17D (0-based), 2nd partition starts at logical sector
A2F6H = <some big number>D.  So if row 1 bytes 10-12 are "00" and byte 8 is 6
or less, Stoned and Michelangelo will clobber files on that disk when they
infect. So, for example,
	80 00 02 00 04 05 51 98 01 00 00 00 F5 A2 00 00
	00 00 41 99 04 05 D1 31 F6 A2 00 00 F6 A2 00 00
	00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
	00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
is the partition table of a disk that will get FAT's clobbered by
Stoned infection. (Padgett - maybe report of starting sector of 1st
partition would be useful?)

In the MBR, those 4 bytes are at offsets 1C6-1C9 .

Thanks.  We get hit in our lab (shared systems) by Stoned quite a lot, and I'd
like to be prepared for file damage.

Subject: re: "new" Troi Virus. (PC)

Since the topic has been brought up again I thought this may be of some help
to those who are inquireing about the TROI virus. This "fact" sheet was
comprised from the help of various researchers and many may see alot of their
findings being repeated here but this submission was as close to the facts
in my opinion.

- -----------------------------------------------
The TROI VIRUS

Length: 322-324 bytes

Hex Signature: 2ac0cf9c80fcfc75

Virus easy to detect because it changes the times & dates for infected
files.  On 3/3/92 a file with the date 1-1-1992 was changed to
0-0-2048 and a file with the date 10-31-1989 was changed to 0-6-2045.

The virus requests 165 paragraphs when becoming resident.

Approximately 56 years is added to infected files.  The virus probably
checks the date of a file before infecting it.

Infects .COM files, but not those with the read-only attribute set.
Trying to infect a file on a write-protected disk will produce the "Abort,
Retry, Fail?" error message.

F-Prot V2.02D detects the virus with a heuristic search with the
following warning: Program contains several features which are
normally only found in virus programs.  It is almost certainly
virus-infected.  Scan V86B identified only one of the infected files
as the Best Wishes Virus.  The two viruses (Troi and Best Wish) have
similar characterics, but whether the two viruses are related is only
conjecture at this point.  The size differences between the two are
significant.

It is trully a new virus because no other virus protection program
has the signature for it.  However, programs monitoring disk activity,
such as writing to files, will trap the infection requests.

Subject: SCAN + VIRx Conflict (PC)

	Here's the situation.  Yesterday, I decided to check
everything for viruses, especially Friday the 13th.  I used VIRx (by
Microcom) and SCAN V80.  When I stopped VIRx with ^C and run SCAN,
SCAN reports the presence of a TAIWAN 3 virus and says shut everything
down immediately.  Which I did and then spent the next two hours
proving to myself that I didn't have a TAIWAN virus.  My guess is that
SCAN was picking up the virus ID clip that Virx was using.  This did
not occur if I allowed VIRx to complete its operations normally (i.e.
I didn't hit ^C).

	The other test I attempted was to dump the memory to a disk
file and then run both scanners on that file.  This produced no result
from SCAN, but VIRx reported a Hacker2 virus (which was good because I
could page through the file and found SCAN's virus ID table intact).
VIRx seems to stop after the first occurence of a virus because it
should have reported hundreds.

	Now my questions:

1) Do SCAN and VIRx look for the same key pieces of virus? (How similar
would their ID tables look?)

2) Why won't SCAN detect its own table when encountered in a file?

3) Do scanners typically encode the ID clips so that they don't appear
as viruses until decoded?  If they don't, do they alter the clip after
they have completed the scan so that all those pieces won't still be
in memory.

One of our users brought us a disk infected with the Stoned virus.  We
ran SCAN (V. 85) which reported it was infected, then we ran CLEAN (V.
85) which reported that it removed the virus.  re-SCANning reported
that the disk was infected with the Stoned virus.

We then used Norton to try to locate a copy of the original boot
sector, which we thought we found in sector 11.  We copied sector
11 over sector 0 and re-SCANed the disk.  This time Scan reported that
the disk was infected with the Azusa virus.

Well, after a bit of hemming and hawing we forced a new boot record on
the disk and this appears to have cleaned up the MBR.

Two questions: 1.)  Is CLEAN unable to remove some variants of the Stoned
virus? and 2.) was this disk originally infected with the Azusa virus?

Subject: SVC-5.0 detected (PC)

Hi netters!

On Thursday the 12. of march I was called to a user who has been hit
by the SVC-5.0 virus (his first report). The virus "crawled" into his
system from a set of disks of a vendor who distributes sort of
pricelists I really don't want to describe more in detail, as it is a
real big company and the user was warned by the firm that he should
get contact to someone who knows how to deal with this. I found the
virus on the system.  It infected only EXE-files.

Well I checked his Novell 2.15 Server with the following
1. F-PROT 2.02D
2. VIRX 2.0
3. IBM VIRSCAN (latest brand new revision 2.2.1.0)

- - Most of the infected EXE-files were related to the list (query progs)
- - The virus infected the LOGIN in \public _and_ \system (RO, shareable).
- - The virus infected the Backupprogram (they are doing daily backups)
Luckily the users are booting from write-protected floppies, so it was
quite easy to remove infections. But I have some questions now, and
maybe someone can shed some light...

a) The growth of the LOGIN and the Backupprogram indicates that the
   virus infects and infects..... w/o checking if files are already
   infected.
   True?

b) All three reported at least SVC-5.0; 1) reported additionally "possible
   mutant..."; 2) reported at least on SVC-5.0/VB (or VD) infected file;
   3) reported "possible new variant"
   Are there any new variants known out there?

c) F-PROT bombed when I checked the distribution-disks of the list. No warm-
   boot possible! The big red was needed.
   (I'll report this to FRISK)
   Any similar experiences under similar conditions. The disk contains some
   LZH-selfextractors which are packed using the "large" modell of LHARC.

The disks are the originals as sent from the distributor and an employee of
this firm installed them!!!

Any infos about this virus and the aforementioned problems etc. are welcome!
Please e-mail to me directly, as I don't want to discuss all in public and
I can read virus-l only once a week, but my mail daily!

Yeah, but listen to this....
I was reading today about the Mutating Engine 0.9. If anyone can
expand on this I'd be very appreciative (it sounds REALLY powerful).
Basically, just like a real virus, this virus mutates each time it
copies itself. That way, it's (I believe) impossible to check for it
with standard virus checkers. It uses encryption/decryption, and so is
very hard to check for. Anyone know more about this?? Sounds like this
will be THE virus to watch out for (and pray once you get it) because
of its genious design.

Tim,

The MBR on DOS disks is located at cylinder 0, head 0, sector 1.  Not
sector 0.

You may be confusing this with DOS logical sector 0, which is
the first logical sector in a DOS partition.

Recently, in this group suggestions were made to use FDISK /MBR
(undocumented) when using DOS 5 and being infected by a MBR-infector.
I'm wondering: suppose you've partitioned your hard disk into multiple
partitions, what then? I can't imagine FDISK being smart enough to go
scan the disk all by itself, hunting for boot records or things like
that, and making up the disk structure from that. Even worse: suppose
you have a DOS- and a Unix partition?

Hi Everyone,

I have a new IBM compatible.  With all the shareware that I use I am
afraid of viruses.  I was wondering if anyone can help explain to me
what are the best anti-virus I can get and how I can set it up on my
computer to where it will scan everytime I turn on the computer.
Thank you very much.
