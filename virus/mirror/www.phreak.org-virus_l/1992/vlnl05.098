Does anybody know if CPAV is planning to encrypt (hide of whatever) their
scan codes in any upcoming version?   It seems to me that ever fourth
"virus" comes up from some scanner seeing CPAV in memory.  This would
seem agrivating for those that like Central Point's interface.

Anybody know anything about it?

Hello Mr. van den Berg,

Error 4494 can occur if SCAN "loses" the current path.  Reasons for
this include running SCAN from a task-swapper or multiuser operating
system, or running SCAN from a disk drive to check multiple disks in
the same drive.

Unfortunately, you did not mention which options you are running SCAN
with nor tell about your operating environment so I can not suggest a
fix.  If you can mail this information to me, I'd be happy to help
resolve the problem.

Okay, I'll take a stab at it.  My organization has several hundred
PC's. A few of them use things like stacker, 4dos, etc.  Were we to
license VDS, most of them could be protected, but what about the rest?
Wouldn't they basically be a weak link in the chain?  You may have the
strongest solution for some individuals, but for large sites, it does
leave holes. We could buy a different package just for those few PC's,
but why bother?  It would be much less of a headache for us to just
buy the other package for all of them, wouldn't it?  Of course, for
the time being, VDS is out of the question anyway since almost all of
them are networked...

That's a lousy attitude.  In any case, your surveys seem to be
confined to individual users.  What about large
corporate/government/institutional sites?  You would be hard pressed
to convince me that networks are the exception, rather than the rule,
with them.  That's a pretty sizable chunk of the market you're
excluding.

Doesn't really matter what the scanner is compatible with.  In that
department, you are competing with several other excellent products
that are much more widely known. It's the integrity checker that makes
VDS different.  If I can't get that to work, then your product is
_just_ another scanner.

As long as VDS is compatible with the new software, that is.  Folks
who decide to try 4dos later on are in for a surprise. Not only do I
have to worry about what I'm running now, but also what I buy in the
future?  Seems a bit much to ask.  Whether you like it or not,
compatibility _is_ an issue for any type of software.  If any magazine
included VDS in a comparative review, your overall rating would
undoubtedly suffer (Of course, certain magazines will always favor
CPAV anyway, because it's prettier. :-( ).  If that happens, it won't
make much difference who your product is targeted for, will it?  I
really hope you'll work on it.

Subject: Joshi virus hit me, 4/28/92. (PC)

     This morning I noticed that every time I put a floppy in my
b drive, the computer trashed all the files on it.  I ran scan77 and
was truly horrified to see the "Shut off your machine NOW!" message.
How unpleasant!  After a scramble to find a boot disk and a lot of
fear and worry, I used clean77 and hopefully solved the problem.
     McAlfee identified the code as "Joshi."  Have any of you
encountered this one?  It sits in the file partition table of the
hard drive.  I don't know what program caused it.  I have been
deleting stuff off of my system lately and McAlfee did not find
it in any of the exec. files.  I have a feeling I got the thing
from a certain bbs to which I subscribe, but I withhold judgment
until I hear from the sysop.  His board is scanned daily.  I can't
imagine one got through.
     If anyone has any background on "Joshi" I'd love to hear it.

Yes (although they account for a small fraction of the total, and v3.1
much less common yet, let alone viruses written specifically for it).
But the main point is that these particular viruses would require data
files to be transferred, which often go less distance than executables
- - you might give some nice utility to someone to play with, but most
office files - word processing and whatever - tend to stay within the
same office, so the rate of spread might be slower than others.

This is part of what worries me - but of course it is not just a case of
looking in lots of different files, you'd have to look for new things. The
point I was trying to make with:

>> ... Any other extensions don't
>> need to be scanned for general viruses but for specific viruses, to
>> save time.

was that it takes a lot of time to scan, and people (well, people
around here) exchange data much more often than programs.  If all
files have to be scanned for more things, more often, there could be
big consumer resistance.  But I think that, since these data files
would be special, it could be possible to speed up the search by
restricting the list of scan strings - or the bytes to search - when
dealing with certain types of file.

But, as I understand it, you are worried that viruses might be missed
by any scanners that at present skip areas of files they think
wouldn't contain the viral code.  I might still be confused (chat via
e-mail, if you like) but wouldn't they have to be looking for totally
different scan strings anyway?  Presumably, if scan strings for any
new virus like that are added, the choice of where to look would also
be updated.  I doubt that heuristic methods would have any chance of
spotting such new viruses either.  The only exception would be if the
data file was used as a dropper for an existing virus, which would be
a bit silly (if anyone goes to the bother of doing that, it will be
spotted soon after the drop - surely the virus, if it uses this area
in the first place, would want to either stay there or use new virus
code, or both?

Have  you tried it?  I have, and I'm not convinced.

I  took a simple WRITE file of 640 bytes and embedded a copy of CALC.EXE
(43,072 bytes) by dragging & dropping from file manager.  The  resultant
file  was  46,464  bytes, which is big enough for the original datafile,
CALC.EXE and whatever information PACKAGER sticks in there.  I  conclude
from  this  that  the  executable  is  indeed  truly  embedded,  *not* a
reference to it - that would be linking.   It  would  appear  that  both
embedding  and  linking  may  be  carried  out  on either datafiles *or*
executables.

Double-clicking  on  the  CALC icon which is embeded works just fine.  I
can only conclude that, if a virus which will be "viable" under  Windows
can  attach  itself  to  CALC.EXE,  it  *will* be active in the embedded
version.

I  don't  have  access  to  a  library  of viruses.  I haven't yet heard
whether or not viruses (DOS ones or specifically-written  Windows  ones)
can  execute  under  Windows.   In  any  case,  I  don't have sufficient
experience/confidence with viruses to risk infecting some files  to  try
this  out  (leastways  on the firm's kit!).  Could one of you anti-virus
experts *please* try this out?

The CPAV program is the only anti-virus programs which has serious
compatibility problems with other anti-virus products, as far as I know.

In fact, the manual states that CPAV should not be used together with
anonter similar package.

As it is generally a good idea to use a couple of scanners, the solution
is simple....don't use CPAV....

It is perfectly natural for my F-PROT program to produce a false alarm on
this file.  The string "141$FLu" translates to the following sequence of
instructions:

              XOR     [SI],SI
              XOR     [SI],SP
              INC     SI
              DEC     SP
              JNZ     ??

Any assembly language programmer should be able to recognize that these
instructions are extremely unlikely to be found by chance in any program,
which is exactly why I use this 7 byte string as one of my Cascade
signatures.

There is nothing that can be done about it - if somebody takes a portion
of a virus, which just happens to include one of my signatures, and
includes that code in a text file, my program might detect the string.

However, note that the file is NOT reported as infected - only as
possibly containing a new variant of the virus....F-PROT will for example
totally refuse to disinfect it.

       About two days ago now I discovered that my Pc was infected
with the form virus. I have checked my diskettes and discovered that a
large number of them are infected as well as my hard drive. So I
aquired a program called Deform which was written specially to deal
with form virus since my normal virus program Scan dosn't deal with
form. However when I booted up with a clean floppy and ran Deform it
returned the message "Unable to read boot sector". Does this mean the
virus has overwritten the boot sector of the hard drive? If this is
the case is the only way of getting rid of the virus to reformat the
hard drive?  Also what are the actual effects of Form virus?
                               Thanks in anticipation.

Knowing your resident scanner is working is always a good idea. In
the Novell environment, eg, any program which hooks Int 21h Function 4Bh
*before* the redirector gets loaded is in big trouble when NETx does
go resident -- the redirector quite naughtily takes over all respon-
sibility (is that hyphenation right?) for Load_And_Exec. Forget your
earlier hooks: they don't get called no more!

I like resident scanners which blip and blink at you so you know
that they *seem*, at least, to be working (which is why my own has
just those features :-). As long as you can switch the sound off --
for some reason, users don't seem to share my taste!

I too noticed this in NS, and have written to them to query their
"advice". The really silly part is the bit about reformatting discs
sent back to you before reuse! Even in South Africa, floppy discs
are so readily available and so cheap that throwing away a disc
sent to you by a friend is probably more cost effective than posting
it back -- and you don't have to buy stamps or walk to a pillar box.

Ergo, one assumes that a disc returned to you has been sent back
because it contains data (apparently, there are even people
in the First World who aren't on the Net..) for your perusal.
Formatting it would then be, in my book, a little precipitous!
OK: I suppose they meant "format after you've lifted off the data".
But they didn't say so, did they?

And since when have portables with their OS in ROM been immune to
viruses? Try the venerable Sharp PC-6220, for example -- and that
neat little beast (286; <2Kg) doesn't even have a floppy drive!

A couple of years ago this myth got *lots* of coverage in the South
African media -- and there were people who were ready to *prove* that
a floppy format on a PC-clone could leave viruses behind. I seem to
recall that there were theories that the little beggars (the viruses,
that is, not the PC-clones) sneaked into the drive cables, or gnawed
their way into the parallel port, or something, and reemerged, foaming
at the mouth and raising two fingers (or one, if the virus had been
watching American movies recently) at the PC community.

Naturally, those with "proof" had been using one of those public
domain multi-version hyper-format utilties which one needs to "prime"
with a boot sector germane to one's own favourite DOS. They'd primed
it with Stoned by mistake and made themselves high-performance
droppers.

Anyway, it was funny at the time.

It isn't just theory, I've seen it happen, and no, the disk drives
don't normally seem to be very faulty - they read everything they
wrote, and most other 360Kb drives perfectly okay.  It is very common
for 360Kb disks to get data errors reading diskettes written by 1.2Mb
drives, that is why there was a warning against doing so in some DOS
manual I saw.  The sector error rate is normally something like 4% and
normally you'd never read the old data without CRC errors, but a
significant number of drives will give you much much worse error
rates, and sometimes read the old data off some sectors WITHOUT AN
ERROR. As I say, I've seen it happen, and the drive didn't seen all
that bad otherwise.  If you want to write data on a 1.2Mb drive and
read it on a 360Kb drive later, I always suggest wiping the disk with
a magnet and formatting it on the 1.2Mb drive.  Some people say to
format it on the 360Kb drive, but you can get unreported errors this
way (more likely you'd get reported errors, of course).  Remember that
360Kb drives tend to be older, and never needed to be so accurately
aligned in the first place.

If anyone still has doubts, I could go into it further in e-mail, in
the mean time think of what happens when the head is out of alignment
away from the thin 96TPI head's track and in the direction of the rest
of the rest of the 48TPI head's track.  It gets all of its own track,
half of a normal 360 Kb drive's track, but possibly almost nothing of
the 1.2Mb drive's track. Of course the field from the 1.2Mb drive's
head will extend a bit, but the question is what does it get most of.
It will almost always get a mixture, in a perfectly aligned disk it
will get about half the width from the new track (amounting to a lot
more than half of the signal, probably), but the head doesn't have to
be far out for the signal ratio to be about 50/50 (you get errors when
it is even slightly close to that), AND it can/does happen that the
ratio goes the other way sometimes! Not that I'm saying you'll get all
of the old disk contents without an error, nor that I've seen it
happen with a virus, and it isn't a "loop hole" a virus can exactly go
out and exploit, but it is worth rememberring to write 360K disks on
360K machines, or wiping the diskette first with a magnet.

check it too.  I realize that this would have to be done at a very low
level and that there would have to be an almost absolute assurance
that nothing else can write to disk, but is this possible?  What about
a virus-checking modem protocol.  I realize this wouldn't work for
.ZIPped files, and such, but it is absolutely possible for other
files.  .ZIP files could even be dynamically unzipped and then
scanned.  It would be a lot of work, but on a fast machine, it could
be done.

Any comments???

Subject: StarShip (PC)

Well, not having seen the virus itself, I do not know why it does not
replicate. However, for those concerned about it, the SafeMBR code
(v1.6 & later) contained in FixMBR will detect the changes it makes to
the MBR and warn the user that "something" has happened.

At this point, examination of the new table pointer should permit
determination if StarShip is present.

Reguarding the failure to replicate, I would have to ask if it has been
tested on a PC containing VGA RAM memory. Like the Michelangelo never
triggering on an XT, from what I have heard, the starship will not work
unless VGA RAM memory is present.

Though I haven't been sending out email lately, I *think* all the
recent file uploads mentioned on Virus-L have been placed in
risc.ua.edu in the directory /pub/ibm-antivirus.

The C source code for Info-Zips' ZIP and UNZIP is now available on
risc.ua.edu as /pub/zip10ex.tar.Z and /pub/unzip41.tar.Z.  Many thanks
to Info-Zip for getting unzip and zip to work on different operating
systems.

This is the latest listing of the files on risc.ua.edu.  If you see
something out of date, please drop me a line with an FTP site...or
upload it to /pub/00uploads and send a short email to me.

I think its a good idea, in fact, I've been working on various
versions of it.  But you're right, it's an awful lot of work.

In fact, there are two versions of it extent right now.  There is the
"Contacts" list that I've been trying to maintain (which is now of
auch a size that I can't put it all into one message, and which Ken is
undertandably loath to publish in the digest), and there are the full
reviews which are archived at cert, among other places.

Keeping the contacts list up to date, and trying to keep up with the
reviews (yes, I *have* received VDS, and the request for a review will
move it up the list) is already a fairly major task.  It is not eased
by the fact that very few of the producers of the products I have
reviewed have seen fit to keep me up to date.  (F-PROT and IBM's
VIRSCAN being notable exceptions, thank you frisk and Dave, and you
deserve better action on updated reviews.)

I can appreciate, myself, the need for "source" information regarding
the latest versions and ftp sites therefore.  I know that those who
maintain the sites have the same problems themselves.  I appreciate,
and try to support, the recent postings from eugene and urvax as to
the latest versions and uploads.  For more information, I also try to
keep current with the comp.binaries...archives groups, and use archie.

Therefore, while Mark's suggestion will be a hard act to follow, it is
a valid and useful exercise, and I will commit to try and put
something together in the next few weeks.  I will try to contain, in a
quick format, something to do with the name, version, type/category,
docs, ease and overall rating.  I will appreciate any further
suggestions as to what should be included, I will appreciate even
more, while I try to get it together, if those who send messges will
forgive me for not replying and possibly not using their ideas.  :-)

Subject: Administrivia (duplicates, address change, FAQ update)

The last two VIRUS-L digests that went out (96, 97) were inadvertently
sent twice.  I believe that this was due to the LISTSERV sending the
two copies.  Hopefully, the problem has been resolved.  Thanks to
those who alerted me to the problem - I do appreciate it when people
let me know that something is broken.  (I can't guarantee that I can
fix the problem, of course, but I will certainly try.)

Also, note that the moderator's network address is going to be
changing soon from krvw@cert.sei.cmu.edu to krvw@cert.org.  This
shouldn't affect the vast majority of you, especially since the old
address will continue to function.

Finally, I hope to be updating and sending out a new copy of the FAQ
shortly.  Now is a good time to send in comments and requests for
changes.  I'll get to the updating as soon as I've installed OS/2 2.0
(it just arrived today!) on my home machine and completed some course
work.

Thanks,

Ken
