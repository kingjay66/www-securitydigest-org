I'm presently very confused... not to mention panicking.  We've got a
load of systems exhibitng bizarre WordPerfect behaviour, but SCANV97
doesn't find anything.  SCANV97B, however, reports "Virus Removed"
while scanning, but "No viruses found" when finished.  HELP!!!!

Hello Jimmy,

in your message dated 3-11-1992 you wrote:

 JK> infected file.  The opposing side argues that it is not necessary to
 JK> detect such files as those above (or specific files found in some
 JK> reviewers' collections) which do not create children of the same form.

I don't agree.

If a virus infects your hard disk the first thing you should do is to
find all the infected files and clean or delete/replace them.

If a copy of the virus remains cause your a-v detector could't find it
you'll probably be infected again.

That's why I think a-v programs should be able to detect also these
forms.

 JK> Files such as those created above and certain files in reviewers'

 JK> endusers. 

Again I don't agree.

If you can't detect a copy of that virus, then it's possible to find
files like those on the Bulletin Boards all around the world.

If a user uploads that file and the sysop runs the usual a-v program
and cannot find the virus, that file will be made downloadable for
everyone.

 JK> you didn't note it, I'm sure all the files infected by your creations
 JK> were detected by all the packages above.

That's right, but if you leave the "creature" :-) on your hard disk
you'll be reinfected again.

 JK> Thus end-users need not worry about your peculiar forms of MtE files
 JK> because you're not going to put those files on anyone else's computer. :-)

Of course I won't, but if someone else (Jack Napier ? :-) knows the
trick ?

A new level of encription ?!?!

May be I didn't explain it well, I didn't compress it with LZEXE, I
just took a COM file with a length of XXX bytes and converted it to a
EXE file with a length of XXX+32 bytes, simply adding a 32 bytes long
header.

Yes, but if you leave a copy of the virus on your hard disk you'll be
infected again.

I didn't encrypt it, I just converted it from COM to EXE.

Again I didn't use LZEXE to compress the file.

I know this is a public echo and I hope that what I'm going to say
won't break your top-secret plans. :-)

I just had a look inside on how F-prot works :-) and these are the
results.

This is a part of the log:

[deleted]

.\0001.EXE  Infection: MtE (?)
.\0002.EXE  Infection: MtE (?)

[deleted]

These are COM files turned to EXE files by adding a 32 bytes long header.

The trouble is there were a third EXE file infected by Mte, as follows:

0001.exe         3091  31/10/92   8.25 
0002.exe         5152  31/10/92   9.37      Header length: 32    Body: 5120
0003.exe         5153  31/10/92   9.37      Header length: 32    Body: 5121

The start of the code is immediately after the header.

The difference between 0003.EXE and 0002.EXE is one byte added at the
end of the body, so they are virtually the same file.

The fact is that F-prot misses all the converted infected files if the
length of the body is greater than 5120 bytes.

I saw the length check inside F-prot, if the length is greater than
5120 bytes then the following controls over the file are skipped.

The question is:  why 5120 ?

Why not 6139 or 844786621 ???

How can you assume that if the length of the body is greater than 5120
bytes then the file can't be infected by Mte ?

Sorry for these technical infos posted here but I don't have a
Internet access and I didn't know how to contact you without have to
make a international call.  :-)

Well, Gobbler was able to detect Dedicated and Pogue also in the
converted form, but it still miss Spawn.

I never saw CryptLab or Fear, but TbScan misses all the unencrypted
forms.

To correct it I added the following lines at the bottom of the
VIRSCAN.DAT:

;
Mte - Unencrypted
COM EXE

It's not a problem with Mte, it's a problem with viruses that use it.

I mean it's very hard to detect it without cause false alarms.  To
avoid false alarms I must put some restrictive conditions, and these
could force my program to discard a possibly infected file if a
particular virus uses strange replicating tecniques.

Subject: F-Prot Bug (?) fixed. Thanks! (PC)

I think I've found the problem on the F-Prot 2.06a I have reported
earlier.  Frisk told me that it could be a memory problem.  So it is.
F-Prot 2.06a ran beautifully on the 386's and 486's but not on two
machines which are 286's without extended nor expanded memory and with
DOSKEY, SILENCE, NETMBX and three other TSRs loaded.  Removing DOSKEY
and SILENCE gave me more room for F-PROT to work in (hopefully, until
the department purchases the memory cards I need).

Thanks for your comments.

I've seen the same thing recently--we have an XT (one of many) running
DOS 3.30; twice in the last three weeks, it has done wwhat you
describe.  As you might expect, the floppies it trashed were
"irreplaceable", so I spent about three hours per disk tracing cluster
chains and rebuilding a usable FAT.  Norton Utility V4.5 showed the
FAT as containing random four-digit numbers in place of the normal
pointers to the next cluster needed.  (Yup, *both* copies.)

I tried SCAN V97, F-Prot 2.05, CatchMtE (in a university, anything's
possible!  :-( ) and the "free" version of VirX.  I got no reports of
anything.

If you can shed some light on this problem before I start replacing
working hardware out of frustration, I'd sure appreciate it.

BTW, has the Monkey virus been reported in Tennessee yet?

True.  But even if F-PROT could detect infections in such files, that
wouldn't prevent a baddy from using any of a bazillion other schemes.
Fact is, there are as many obscure ways to hide an infection as there
are twits who want to do it.  To expect F-PROT, or any other scanner, to
be able to deal with all of them is asking a bit much of it, and picking
out just this one would be pretty much pointless.  Myself, I prefer
seeing Frisk put his effort into more useful things.

Hi there,

Thanks for all the info regarding FDISK /MBR.  However, I attempted to
disinfect a PS/2 Model 55 with the FORM virus using a coldboot from my
DOS 5.0 disk created for such a purpose, ran FDISK /MBR and then ran
F-PROT 2.05 and it still reported FORM as being present in the boot
sector.  Using SYS.COM, then running F-PROT again showed the disk to
be clean.  Unfortunately I don't have the kit - or indeed the time -
to sit down and experiment as the machine had to be cleaned up as
quickly as possible.  Is this a case of 'ghosting' with a scan string
still left on the disk though the virus is inactive?

On a similar topic I see that SYS.COM works fine under DOS 5.0 for
this virus but under DOS 3.3 I have heard reports of there being
insufficent room to tranfer system when attempting to disinfect a FORM
infected hard disk. Is this due to the IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS having to
be in a particular location? I suspect so but again I do not have the
kit to try this out. However, I know the experts on this list do, so
can you help?  With the FORM virus using SYS.COM is often quoted as a
means to disinfect. So do I have to delete the hidden system files
first and then SYS?

As always thanks in advance

Subject: FORM VIRUS INFECTION IN GERMANY (PC)

Report of Computer Virus Infection in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany.

On 18 November 1992, we discovered the FORM virus on the boot
sector of 12 of our PC hard disks.

We were alerted when the computers started beeping with every
keystroke.  The McAffee scan indicated the FORM virus.

We informed the CERT Hotline, then removed the virus with a
commercial anti-virus product.

We suspect that we initally got the virus from a commercial
educational distribution diskette, but can not confirm this.

Question:  Outside of using a commercial anti-virus package,
           is there any way of eliminating this virus "manually"
           (ie. editing sectors on the disk)?

I've just pulled VSUMX (VSUMX209.ZIP) from Oakland and tried it out,
in search of info on Power Pump (not found :( ).  The main exe file is
a self-contained hypertext type database engine, and ran OK under DOS
3.3 on my PS/2 (386sx); I see no real reason why it shouldn't run on
an 8088 (I don't have anything much below 386sx :)) - there are no
warnings.

It seems quite well put together - you won't need any additional
software to run it.  The VSUMX version comes complete with a
validation utility (courtesy of McAfee) and a README file which gives
expected checksum values (assuming that no swine has gone and fiddled
with them to match their pet virus).

What you *will* need is either PKUnzip (1.10) or something compatible
(I used Xtree Pro Gold 2) to unzip the compressed file.

After that, it should be plain sailing.  Unless you're looking for
info on Power Pump (anyone oblige me ?).

Hello everybody (frisk in particular),

The other day I noticed that F-prot 2.06a hangs when it is instructed
to scan a diskette, while this diskette has not been inserted properly
(or the drive door has not been closed). F-prot DOES notice the
problem and prompts the user to correctly insert the diskette and to
press Enter when done. But nothing helps (except rebooting) from that
point on.  Glad to have the memory scan report back, though.

Sincerely,

Has anyone out there heard of a UNIX virus? Or a virus that could
infect a UNIX system?  Are there any good virus protection/scanning
programs out there?  Please post answer or mail to
sfc104@psuvm.psu.edu or sfc104@psuvm.bitnet.  Thanks.

I have recently been volunteering with a local cable public access

viruses and their symptoms, and solutions.

Thanks for any info,

Subject: MtE detection tests (part 2/5) (PC)

Hello, everybody!

Here is the long awaited report about the MtE detection tests that we
performed at VTC-Hamburg.  It is rather longish, so maybe Ken should
consider splitting it into parts.  Normally, I should have put it for
anonymous ftp, instead of publishing it here, but the preliminary
results of the tests raised enough interest and discussions, so I
decided to publish it in a whole in this newsgroup.  Nevertheless, it
- - -is- available for anonymous ftp as

ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de:pub/virus/texts/tests/mtetests.zip

[Moderator's note: The complete text of Vesselin's MtE tests are also
available from:
      cert.org:pub/virus-l/docs/mtetests.zip 
As I had previously indicated, I have broken Vesselin's tests down
into five parts and will post each seperately.]

Enjoy.  Comments, questions, and suggestions are welcome.

Regards,
Vesselin

[part 2/5]

2. The test conditions.

In order to test the ability of the scanners to detect the MtE-based
viruses, we at the VTC-Hamburg generated a large set of replicants of
the currently known such viruses, and tested how well the scanners
were able to detect them.

It is important to note that a scanner can do only one thing - detect
known viruses. If the virus is known, the scanner either can detect
it, or it cannot. There is no such thing as "99.99% detection". Even
if only one infected file is missed, this file can cause a
re-infection later. Furthermore, such "undetected replicants" may
accumulate in a system from several re-infections, until the whole
system eventually becomes infected only with samples that the
particular scanner used to detect the virus misses. This holds for any
known virus - not just for the polymorphic ones. But it is not
surprising, that the scanners usually "miss" some replicants of the
extremely polymorphic viruses.

Anyway, in our tests we give a boolean value to the scanners tested. If
they succeed to detect all samples of the virus, we say that they are
able to detect this MtE-based virus reliably. If they miss at least
one sample, we say that they are unable to detect the virus reliably.

In fact, this is not quite correct. Since the MtE allows the virus to
take an extremely large amount of different appearances, we are unable
to verify that a particular scanner is able to detect all of them. All
we can say is that we were unable to find any sample that that
particular scanner does not detect. This does not mean that such
sample does not exist - it just means that we were unable to find it.
However, when we are saying that a particular scanner is NOT able to
detect a particular MtE-based virus reliably, this means that we have
the proof that it is so - a sample of the virus that the scanner
misses.

We submitted the scanners to three tests: standard, additional, and
acid.

2.1. The standard test.

In our collection we have 7 different MtE-based viruses: CoffeeShop,
CryptLab, Dedicated, Fear, Groove, Pogue, and Questo. Dedicated is the
demo virus that comes in source with the MtE. CryptLab, Fear, and
Questo are just simple patches of it. CoffeeShop, Pogue, and Groove
are different. CoffeeShop infects only EXE files, Groove infects both
COM and EXE files, and the other viruses infect only COM files.

For each of the viruses, the following number of replicants was
generated:

CoffeeShop CryptLab Dedicated Fear Groove (EXE) Groove (COM) Pogue Questo
  2000       2000     2000    2000    2000         2000      2000   1994

The replicants are natural relicants of the particular viruses i.e.,
the virus was let to infect that amount of victim files. The
generation of that amount of replicants was not a trivial thing, since
some of the viruses (Dedicated and the ones similar to it) are not
very infectious - they are not memory-resident and infect only 2-3
files in the current directory when run.

The MtE sometimes generates unencrypted replicants (with probability
of about 7% during the generation of the test set).  The following
numbers represent the unencrypted samples of the above set.

CoffeeShop CryptLab Dedicated Fear Groove (EXE) Groove (COM) Pogue Questo
   148        131      137    141      161           135      119    150

Furthermore, the Groove virus is buggy and damages the EXE files it
infects with a probability of 1/512. Four of the generated EXE
replicants of this virus were damaged - 2 encrypted and 2 unencrypted
files. The damaged files cannot be executed - DOS displays "Error in
EXE file" and refuses to run the file. Therefore, such files cannot be
a source of infection.

The generation was done on a Novell NetWare 2.15 server, in a special
account with rights set in such a way, that the viruses couldn't
escape to any other directory outside the subdirectory tree where they
were let to infect.

The preparation of this virus test set was done by two visiting
students from the Rostok University - Dirk Harak and Jan Lankowski.

2.2. The additional test.

All scanners that passed the standard test for a particular virus,
were tested on the standard CARO collection of MtE virus samples of
this particular virus. This collection is much smaller and contains
the following samples:

CoffeeShop CryptLab Dedicated Fear Groove (EXE) Groove (COM) Pogue Questo
    3         1        108     28       1           21        102    100

2.3. The acid test.

During the generation of the test set of virus samples and the actual
tests, we received four new MtE-based viruses. They are closely
related and are of the companion type. Those scanners that passed the
above two tests for ALL MtE-Based viruses, were tested on these four
new viruses. Only one sample of each virus was used - we had no time
to generate 2,000 samples of each of them.

Scanners that succeeded to pass all the three tests were declared
winners of our tests. I would like to emphasize again, that this does
not mean that they are indeed able to detect all possible MtE-based
viruses with 100% reliability. It only means that in our tests they
did so.

It was verified that all replicants used in all the three tests were
different. That is, no two of the 16,362 files had one and the same
contents.

Note also that we tested only the MtE-detection abilities of the
scanners. (Although, when the programs are obviously buggy, this is
mentioned in the comments.) No tests were performed for detection of
other viruses, quality of the user interface and documentation, amount
of used disk space and memory used, speed, and other such things.
Therefore, the results of these tests should not be interpreted to
show that one scanner is "better" than another. As I already mentioned
elsewhere in this article, the results cannot be used even to show
that one scanner detects the MtE-based viruses "better" than another.
The only way to interpret our results is to show which scanners are
NOT able to detect the MtE-based viruses reliably.
