Subject: Banyan Vines "Trojan" identified (legitimate) (PC)

Would like to post this to hopefully save other Vines administrators
much headache chasing a problem that's really not a problem.

I discovered this problem while working on an end-user's system and
finding about 40 copies (in almost every directory on his C: drive) of a
file named "errlevel.com".  Not being an assembler programmer,
dissasembling this beastie was a royal pain (it is benign other than
eating disk space) and determining it's source took quite a bit of time,
coffee and hair pulling!

On Banyan Vines networks that have a 3270 SNA service with the File
Transfer Software the following will occur under the specified
circumstances:

         If the user has the FTS send.exe in his path before the
            z:\send.exe

         The user has one of the two following conditions on his system:
             1 - resident 3270 emulation is not loaded
             2 - resident 3270 emulation is loaded but no TSO session is
               active on the host

         The user types "send" at the DOS prompt (or from a menu that
            attempts to execute via the path)

The user will receive an error message from the FTS software. So far, so
good - the smart user will realize the error and follow up with "z:\send"
to use the desired feature.

The problem is that the FTS software (specifically ibmban.com) will,
upon error exit, create a 48 byte file named errlevel.com in the default
directory.  Apparently this file is used by some of the other spawned
programs to determine the specific error which caused ibmban.com to
abort.

The answer to the "problem" is to not be overly concerned and to simply
delete the spurious copies of errlevel.com that will accumulate and use
up disk space.  I hope my experience chasing this ghost will keep others
from burning the midnight oil chasing what turns out to be just a stupid
programming practice...

Well, Intel added some bits and pieces - basically (if I understood them
correctly) they took one of the existing scanners and changed it into
a program that would run on the server itself...

Sorry - V2P6 is a typical polymporphic virus...it is not necessary that
the encryption changes, only that the implementation of the encryption
changes - for example with the addition of "garbage" instructions in
between the actual instructions.

Subject: Error in SCAN V89B ? (PC)

Hi fellow netters,

I just stumbled over a weird error in SCAN V89B.  S.o. in our faculty
asked me to scan her PC she had bought somewhere around the stone age.
It has IBM-PC DOS 2.10 (don't laugh) on it.

As I started Scan it came back with the message `Sorry, I cannot open
"" to compute checksum.'  And that was it, it refused to work.  Then I
switched back to V86B and this time IT WORKED, no problem whatsoever!
BTW, my copy has not been hacked with. When I extracted it, it had all
the -AV codes in it, including John's number.

Now I know I c(sh)ould upgrade the f** machine but as for now I don't
have the time for that, neither do I have the time to RTFM.

Is this a known problem or is it something that could be fixed using a
parameter?

C u'round,
Rolf

   Rest assured, we pull a few other tricks :-) VDS is not a scanner, it
is an anti-viral centered around integrity checking. It is not prone to
such viruses as Dark Avenger, 4096 etc. because of the way it operates.
   Yes, it comes with a separate scanner which could be fooled to spread
infection if one crafted a virus after studying its operation.
   Specifically, VDS.EXE is the integrity checker that needs to be
installed on the hard drive. VDSFSCAN.EXE is the virus scanner that is
compatible with networks, even CD-ROMS etc. VITALFIX.EXE is a tool that
helps the user to deal with MBR/BR infectors and so on.
   You are invited to try it. It is on Simtel.

   The SPECIAL system is standard MS/PC DOS based PCs most people
use. They are prepared using FDISK, and are not compressed or protected by
an exotic security system. You seem to argue by the exception rather than
the rule :-)

  That's good. It is supposed to be installed properly first. As far as
DR-DOS is concerned, Bill Gates is not losing any sleep, neither are we:-)

  Well, the warning is a little too strong. Just make sure you use the
device driver generated for the same computer only on the same machine.
And if you repartition the hard drive, re-installation is a safe bet.
On alike machines, it may work fine, but why not install it as intended.

  Yes, the exceptions, but not the rules. It is honest about what it does
not like so that the user has a chance not to use it. What do you think
about the opinions in the docs? Are they totally wrong?

  Sharp eye, Vesselin. But again, you are arguing by the exception rather
than the rule. Most people do not run away from their beloved PCs because
a dumb virus hit them in the past, and they do not even bother to get
virus protection even after the attack. Well, yes, they run a scanner :-)

   Wait a minute. The section about virus attack methods is intended to
provide the unexposed users with preliminary information about how such
beasts work. Not a comprehensive chapter on slealth viruses. Maybe, it is
too preliminary for someone like you who has seen it all as far as PC
viruses go.

  Why don't you describe the methods you have in mind, and I will see if I
am allowed to tell you which ones defeat VDS scheme. Honest, I will.
Did you get a chance to see which pet viruses you have were able to spread
on a system protected by VDS? I mean, without being detected.

  Okay, I see what you had in mind. The problem with such verification is
that if the signature for a stealth beast is not known to the verifier,
the results are scary. We do not rely on simple signature checking in
memory like some others do. I hope you are not saying that it is sufficient
to do signature scan of memory.

   Please, take a closer look at it if you have time, and on a regular
system most people use, not DR-DOS or other fancy things. As far as UT
is concerned, just don't let a stealth fast infector UT does not have a

   Sharp eye again, Vesselin. VDS is meant to be installed on stand-alone
machines, not network servers. The identification part (VDSFSCAN) works on
networks, even on CD-ROMs!  Sure, VDS is not for everyone. It sure is the
strongest software solution available, maybe not as convenient as some
other packages with flashy user interfaces. Not as expensive either :-)

  Unzip VDS20T.zip onto a formateed, blank floppy diskette that can go in
your A: drive. Boot from a clean, MS/PC DOS diskettes. Once you get to A>
prompt, put in the diskette with the VDS stuf on it in drive A:, and type
INSTALL and press ENTER. Follow the instructions. Simple and easy.
  If you have DR-DOS, Stacker, or some other non-standard stuff on your
machine, please do not waste your time, VDS is not for such systems.

  Decoys are not for boot sector infectors. Non-resident ones, well you
know how common they are :-) Device driver infectors, damn, how many of
those do you have? StarShip actually infects!

  I see. I am told (thanks Jon) that the book is $24. Just a dollar cheaper
than the complete VDS package :-) It must be worth it since you seem to
like it so much. Is it true that it explores the effects of viruses in
environments where sharing of info is desired, but transitivity cannot be
contained? Situations like system A is secure, system B is secure, but when
they interact, it is a different ball game?

This is exactly why I initially insisted on names of unlimited depth
in my scheme! Unfortunately, several people objected. They even wanted
to limit the scheme to three levels, but for the file infectors this
is not always possible, so we decided to stick to a four-level naming
scheme..

As to your particular example, I tend to accept it (with only more
consistent numbering: 1, 2, 3; not 1, 4, 6). However, in order to
resolve -all- the virus names correctly, we'll have to study each of
the virus variants as carefuly as you have studied the Empires. With
the current ammount of about 1,300 viruses and averagely 100 new ones
appearing per month, this is simply impossible.

It has never been published that the particular virus that Jon David
observed to seem to bypass some of the Novell rights has been
IDENTIFIED to be the original Jerusalem. (BTW, currently there exist
at least two Novell-oriented viruses. The first of them is Jerusalem
based and has 2 variants, and the second is Yankee Doodle based and
has 4 different variants. These viruses do not bypass Novell's rights
- - they can't - but they are Novell NetWare-aware and collect the
passwords that the users use.)

I have a copy of the article that you mentioned above, which tells the
story from Novell's point of view. It seems to me that they are
right. However, the document mentiones something which I have not seen
in print. I am not a NetWare expert (in fact, my knowledge in this
area is minimal), but as far as understand it, it tells about a
serious security flaw. Nothing particularly virus-related; just the
fact that under some versions of Novell NetWare, if you log in with
some rights (e.g., supervisor) and then revoke some of them; the
rights in fact are still available until you log out. Have in mind
that I might have misunderstood what the document actually says; I'll
post the relevant part tomorrow.

I didn't see any followup to your note in virus-l digest, volume 5

The CIAC group put out two bulletins on this topic in early November,
1991.  The trojan was not widespread as first thought, it was found on
a very small number of systems.  Your information on the program is
(basically) accurate, and is good enough to check VMS systems for this
trojan.

I am getting somewhat bored with some of the recent postings
especially when they discourage new ideas, or enter an endless loop of
discussion which might be better off conducted off-line.  That said,
let me be more specific.  First, I want to complement Bontchev,
Stiller, Padgett, Skulson, Chess, and others for taking the time to
post and to answer some of the more mundane questions over and over
and over.

I am impressed with the ability of some people to be able to post
frequently and voluminously. :-) I would request that the postings cut
down on a lot of the product specific information, not so much bug
fixes as these are useful, but the endless arguing over which product
is best.  I suggest that no one product is the best for all people,
and that in fact, many products may offer the best solution for a
particular site, environment, or individual depending on things not
often discussed as being important.  For example, is a product which
identifies 3000 virus strains and is capable of scanning faster than
any other product necessarily better?  I would say maybe, but then
again, maybe not.  Where is the comment on user interface?  Ease of
administration?  User goof proofing?  Ease of dissemination within a
large organization?  I have seen none of these issues covered, and yet
I would suggest that they are much more important than many of the
other issues.  For example.  A power user may find CPAV to be the best
because s/he likes the interface and the fact that there are so many
options to configure.  A less literate user may like SCAN since it is
a pure vanilla product and is relatively simple to use, no need to
learn an interface.  A hacker may like some of Padgett's, Yetiser's,
Skulason, or UT.  No matter which product there may be someone who
feels it is the best for him/her.  So let's get back on track.

I would like to see a discussion of generic characteristics which are
desirable for different user classes rather than specific product
characteristics.  Then one can use the set of desirable
characteristics to choose among the miriad of products available.
Also, I find it discomforting to see people with new ideas such as
Alexander Shehovtsov, and Tarken Yetiser being immediately flamed by
someone posting that there is obviously a way around the method
suggested.  Any technique which yields new ways to prevent viruses
should be encouraged.  Truth be told, we could find a way around all
anti-virus programs if we really wanted to expend the effort.  The
point is not to build a product which can prevent 100% of all known
and unknown viruses, but to build products which decrease our risk to
acceptable levels.  This has been said before, but I feel like I
should reiterate the point.  No one product will protect 100% of the
systems from 100% of the viruses.  But, it's still fun to try :-)!  I
think that if we had accepted Fred Cohen's hypothesis that it is
impossible to build a virus detector that is 100% effective and so why
bother, then we would be in a pretty bad fix right now.  What has
happened is that we have accepted this hypothesis, but said, well, how
about 95% of all viruses?

As T. Yetiser states in his documentation, the counter argument to
Cohen's hypothesis is that while it may be true that no one can build
a program to detect 100% of the viruses, it can also be said that no
one can build a virus which is 100% non-detectable.  The fact that we
have found ways to detect even the most troublesome viruses points to
this fact.

So let's be kinder and gentler!  I want to see new ideas, even bad
ideas.  If no one ever shared their failures then we would all be
doomed to repeat them!  Also, I would like to call for a more robust
FAQ.  It is a good start, but given the continuing onslaught of common
questions not addressed by the FAQ it is obvious that it needs to be a
living document which continues to grow and become more complete.  I
would be happy to enter into a discussion with others on making
additions which would be mutually beneficial to all parties concerned.
Thanks for the bandwidth! :-)

Sincerely,

Brian Seborg

General Description:

VACCINE operation monitor, PHYSICAL scanner, CHECKUP change detection, SHELTER
operation restriction and XRAY CMOS backup.

                  Comparison of features and specifications



User Friendliness

Installation

The program is shipped on writable, but protected, 5 1/4" 360K media.  Although
a scanner is included in the package, scanning of the system to be protected is
suggested only after installation is completed.

Manual and automated installations are provided.  The manual installation is
incomplete in that the necessary final step to have *any* protection at all
lies in another part of the manual.

The automated installation is performed through a simple batch file which
creates a directory and copies the file into it.  An environment variable is
set and used, so the installation may fail on occasion.  A command is prepended
to the beginning of the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  Although the documentation
specifically states that the INSTALL program will work with a dual floppy
system, in fact it will not.

The VACCINE program, and operation monitoring, is stated to be the "soul" of
this package.  Any program which performs any kind of "suspect" functions must
be authorized.  Once authorized, the program can perform any of the restricted
operations without interference.

Ease of use

The VACCINE program requires a list of programs which are authorized to perform
restricted functions.  Since "restricted functions" includes such things as any
form of deletion, a number of programs will need to be added to the list.  The
list is a simple ASCII file of program names, one per line.  (The "ease of use"
of this can be determined by the fact that the documentation suggests EDLIN be
used to create or amend it.)

The creation of the authorized programs file would not be a simple matter.
Likely programs would have to be run "against" VACCINE to see if they trigger
the alarms.  I was surprised to find that the PHYSICAL scanner triggered
VACCINE, since it should only be performing "read" operations.  In this light,
the file could only be built in an environment guaranteed free from viri ...
which somehow seems to defeat the purpose.

Help systems

Although the manual talks about "online help", this is, in fact, restricted to
a list of command line switch options if you use the "-h" switch or improper
switch syntax.  Since "no switches" is not improper, one must read the manual
in order to know that there are switches.

Compatibility

As of this version, none of the Vaccine programs will function if a network is
present.  A network version is available separately.

Company Stability

Unknown.

Company Support

The package makes no statements regarding support.

Documentation

The documentation is sufficient to install and run the programs.  Its
statements and examples are clear.  However, it must be said that the claims
made for the program, and the discussions of viri in general, border on
misrepresentation.  There is *no* discussion of boot sector infectors, although
the signature list contains strings for several, and the only suggested method
for dealing with infections is to "*erase [the infected program] immediately*
using the DOS ERASE command".

A clever use of the documentation is that the command to "teach" VACCINE to
accept new "restricted" programs is buried in the documentation, and is not a
part of the online help.

Hardware Requirements

None stated.

Performance

PHYSICAL identified about two thirds of the common infectors presented to it.
A number of the viri were misidentified, but were, at least, flagged as
infected.  The choice of signature strings shows, therefore, promise for
identifying new variants.  Where multiple infections are found, the program
will scroll off the screen.

The Vaccine package as a whole has serious shortcomings with regard to boot
sector infectors.  The PHYSICAL program will not, apparently, identify boot
sector infectors in diskettes in drive B.  VACCINE will not catch a BSI in
memory on startup (Stoned was used in testing), and will falsely identify the
program that is trying to make a change to the boot sector.  (In the test case,
this was its own PHYSICAL.)  Since most activities that trigger Stoned to
infect will also trigger VACCINE, this is of no help at all.  (Short of
rebooting the computer, VACCINE offers no "protection": it is only an alarm.  I
would see this kind of interference as being almost worse than Antivirus Plus.)

The one bright spot is that the boot sectors of diskettes in drive A, if
present, are always scanned for viri.  If found, however, the suggested
remedial action is "Reinstall DOS": effective against a BSI on a floppy, but
perhaps misleading when the diskette is non-bootable and the "system" is on the
hard drive.

It should be noted that all "restricted" operations are considered together.
Therefore, once a program has been "authorized", it is allowed to perform any
operations.  If an "authorized" program becomes infected, it will be allowed to
infect all others.  (An authorized program can also "permit" a virus, already
resident, to operate.)

Local Support

None provided.

Support Requirements

It is unlikely that novice users could obtain significant protection from this
package.  Intermediate users could likely install it and make suitable
decisions regarding "authorized" programs, but in all likelihood advanced
support would be required for installation and creation of the authorized
programs file.

                                 General Notes

Although the "multi-layered" approach to protection is good, with this
package's reliance on operation monitoring it is difficult to find an
environment to recommend it for.  Low change, low utility use, no diskette use
situations may find it suitable.
