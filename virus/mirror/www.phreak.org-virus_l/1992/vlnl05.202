I don't have a definitve answer to the question Mike posed, but I can report
one way you *can't* tell which version you have... :-/

The VER/R command returns the following for **both** versions:

        DOS 5.00
        Revision A
        DOS in <low,high> memory

(The wording may not be exact here, but the Revision A part is correct.)
I have tested this on both versions, dates 04-09-91 and 11-11-91.

Since the "Revision A" message appears regardless of version, this is *NOT*
a reliable way to determine which version you have.  To be safe, check the
date.

BTW, by my reckoning, the 65280-cluster limit represents a partition of
about 130 MB.  No small bug, this... :-(

Hope this heads off any confusion or false security...

Infection by a stealth virus is a possibility, but simply regular FAT
corruption is a much more likely explanation.  Do the following:

    reboot from a clean diskette

    rerun CHKDSK

    if it reports that the file sizes are wrong, you just have regular

Sorry - this is not really possible.  You cannot use software to *prevent*
the hard disk from becoming infected, if you boot from an infected floppy disk,

This can be achived via hardware methods, but software can only detect boot
sector infections after the fact - not prevent it.

Well, VIRSTOP (or Quick scan) will not detect as many viruses as
F-PROT Secure scan.  It will miss all MtE viruses for example, and
most of the viruses which cannot be found using a signature-based
approach. While Secure scan will detect around 99% of all viruses,
Quick scan may detect only around 90% (however, it will detect a much
higher percentage of "in-the-wild" viruses).

Well, 12K isn't exactly small....and of that only 2K is code, the rest
is the signatures.  Of course, by using the /DISK command-line switch
you can get VIRSTOP's memory usage down to 2K, as the cost of a small
delay when running any program.

No, not yet.  However, I am working on adding several features to
VIRSTOP, which are lacking from it.  They are:

   option to scan files during copy (done, being tested now)
   option to scan boot sectors when disks are accessed (almost finished)

Well, unless I'm wrong, the description I got seemed to indicate an
old problem - the message "Possibly a new variant of stoned" happens
quite often on disks that have once been infected with stoned, and
improperly disinfected by a program that just overwites a part of the
boot sector with valid code, leaving a part of the virus, so my
program only gets a partial match.  That happens much more frequently
than new virus variants, so I just thought it was the case here too -
I apologize if I was wrong, but you see, without a copy of the boot
sector it is practically impossible to tell exactly what is going on.

[stuff deleted]

Hmmm.... The worst of all is that the real working virus (Dir_II)
*doesn't* contain such piece of code... Except... Well, there is one
"variant" of this virus, which tries to be polymorphic and uses
something similar to the above to variably encrypt/decrypt itself...
However, as pointed out by the Russian anti-virus researcher Dmitry
Gryaznov, this variant of Dir_II will never work, due to some serious
bugs in it... Maybe F-Prot should just not try to detect it?

Not really. It's rather hard to simply patch a virus, so that you
completely modify its memory installation strategy and still produce a
closely related variant. It's almost certain that you'll get a
completely different virus, which would be detected by a different
scan string.

I suppose that NAV is doing something similar to TbScan/HTScan - each
virus is described with the area of memory it can occupy. Such areas
could be: INT (in the interrupt table), DOS (in a memory hole in DOS),
LOW (as a normal TSR, like Jerusalem), TWIXT (shortening the last MCB
and copying itself above it), VIDEO (in the video buffer), UPPER (in
the memory between the video buffer and the 1 Mb boundary), AT (at a
particular segment), etc. There are a few other possibilities, which I
cannot recall off the top of my head.

This restricted memory search usually works in most cases. That is, it
is silly to look for Stoned in the DOS buffers, when you know that it
installs itself after the top of memory pointed by the BIOS variable
at 0:413h... The method has problems only in a few cases - for
instance, the Number of the Beast and a couple of other viruses
install themselves in the DOS buffers. When you copy an infected file,
there is fair chance that the virus code (although inactive) will be
found in one of these buffers - which is exactly where you should look
for this virus in the first place. The solution is to check whether
the signature is found in an -existing- DOS buffer (when the real
virus installs itself in a buffer, it removes that buffer from the
chain of the available ones), but I know about no program that bothers
to do that...

I disagree. It absolutely doesn't matter when the anti-virus program
has been released. What does matter is (1) when the program has been
updated to detect this virus, (2) when did the virus appear, and (3)
are there any other possible scan strings for that virus.

If a virus like Cascade appears tomorrow, and if it uses variable
encryption, so that the only possible scan string is the (short)
decryptor in the beginning, guess what will both McAfee Associates and
any other anti-virus company pick as a scan string...

Now, -that- is definitively fair to say. Any scanner-like anti-virus
program that doesn't do the above (and that doesn't clean up the
memory after itself upon termination) is plain silly.

Well, in this particular case, it is documented... :-) They just tell
you in the docs that their program is incompatible with any other
anti-virus software... :-))

Allegedly, a version of the product mentioned will be included in
MS-DOS 6.0. Allegedly, this particular problem has been already fixed
in that particular version.

That's a really good idea... As Dr. Solomon says, it's very easy to
create the perfect virus detector. It will achieve 100% detection rate
when tested with -any- virus collection. It can be just a short .BAT
file. Here it is:

echo %1 is a virus.

(or something similar, to include the boot sectors testing, but you
get the idea).

Unfortunately, such program has no practical use, since it gives an
infinite number of false positives. The tough problem is to create a
scanner that still has a good enough detection rate, but has no false
positives...

Unfortunately, there is no simple way to test a scanner for false
positives... False negatives are easy - you just get a huge virus
collection and count how many viruses the scanner -doesn't- detect...
I really don't know how a reliable false positive test should be
performed... One idea is to get all the MS-DOS software from Simtel20
(it is available on CD-ROM), unpack it and run the scanners on all the
executable files. Another idea is to run each scanner on a wide range
of other anti-virus programs, maybe even including itself. At the
VTC-Hamburg we are working on a test protocol about how anti-virus
tests should be performed, so any ideas are welcome.

I think that Jim Bates' anti-virus package has a program that does
something similar, but I have never seen it, so I am unable to provide
more information.

At least some packages do that already. (I.e., location, and size
checks. The "expected values" are a bit difficult, due to the lots of
different versions of DOS that are around - e.g., the German version
of COMMAND.COM has a different length than the English version of the
same file, even for one and the same version of DOS.)

Again, most full-blown anti-virus packages allow you to use only some
of their functions.

You mean, a monitoring program? Well, they are so easy to be
bypassed... OK, maybe they should be there as a protection at least
against the stupid viruses, but then such programs tend to be rather
obtrusive...

Three objections. First, I was speaking (in this particular case) about
a platform-independent -scanner-, not about an integrity checker.
Second, it is supposed to run without a virus being active in memory,
so there is no reason to check the buffers and other such stuff.
Third, as I said, it will be platform-independent. In order to port it
to another platform, you'll have to write the platform-specific I/O
routines. If you want to scan the memory, you'll just have to write
routines that provide access to it as a file. Not difficult at all.

First, Michelangelo is not that much platform-dependent... I mean, it
can perfectly infect a Unix-only system, if it runs on an IBM PC
compatible... (The fact that it will also crash the system and prevent
it from booting is a completely different story.) Second, in order to
use that scanner on such a platform, you'll just have to write the I/O
routines that provide access to the boot sectors - as simple as that.

Why different? As far as I understand, this is exactly what they are
doing (maybe Prof. Spafford can comment on this?). Just instead of the
ugly assembly language solution, they are using an object-oriented
approach and are implementing it in C++. :-)

In fact, it depends on the algorithm used. If you are using a CRC,
just using a different seed for the checksum does not make it secure -
you must change the polynomial each time. If you are using something
cryptographically strong as DES, MD4, MD5, MD2, or some such, then
just changing the seed is enough.

No, the problem is cause by exactly the opposite - both Stoned and
Michelangelo copy the MBR to exactly one and the same spot (on the
hard disk), which results in the original MBR being lost.

Removal of the above is very easy: you read 0,0,0, see Stoned in it,
get 0,0,7 and put it at 0,0,0. Since (according to your description),
it contains the real MBR, the problem is solved.

Correct, so in reality this is what happens:

1) Clean disk:

        0,0,0   (Real MBR)
        0,0,7   (unused)

2) After a Michelangelo infection:

        0,0,0   (Michelangelo)
        0,0,7   (Real MBR)

3) Now comes a Stoned infection:

        0,0,0   (Stoned)
        0,0,7   (Michelangelo, put there by Stoned, overwriting the
                 real MBR)

4) A scanner sees Stoned in the MBR and tries to remove it, by
restoring what it believes is the real MBR from 0,0,7 (where Stoned
puts it):

        0,0,0   (Michelangelo - fetched from 0,0,7 by the remover)
        0,0,7   (Michelangelo - still there, unless wiped out)

5) The scanners no sees the Michelangelo and tries to remove it by
restoring what it believes is the real MBR from 0,0,7 (where
Michelangelo puts it):

        0,0,0   (Michelangelo - fetched from 0,0,7 by the remover)
        0,0,7   (Michelangelo - still there)

And so on ad infinitum...

If the remover is smart enough, it will wipe out the sector at 0,0,7
at step 4. Also, at step 5 it will figure out that the sector at 0,0,7
now is wiped out and contains no valid MBR (this is what F-Prot does).
Now, if the remover is -really- smart, it will install a valid MBR
program that it carries with it, just for such cases... Of course,
there are some pitfalls with preserving the partition table data, but
they can be dealt with... Does anybody know a scanner that is that
smart?

Given the already-existing number of anti-viral product-related

to do this offline in email.  If Rob is willing to do the comparison,
I'd be happy to review a draft copy.

capture.com, however, 'modifies itself in a highly suspicious way...'
This wasn't my machine and I don't know Word5, so I don't have any

Sigh... Hints to all producers of scanners: Yes, indeed the most
important question that interests the users is "Am I infected or
not?". However, the NEXT important question is "If I am infected,
which virus is it, i.e. what can it do/has done to me?". (The THIRD
question is usually "How do I get rid of it?".) Reports like "Generic
Boot Virus" or "FamilyQ Virus" are not very informative... Users -do-
want exact identification (or at least "almost exact identification",
if we use Frisk's terminology)...

No kidding, you have seen the Marijuana message? On the screen??
Displayed by the virus??? Then you should have a new variant - none of
the ones we have here displays that message. The original virus
displays only the first part - "Your PC is Now Stoned".

Ah, this explains the "Generic Boot Virus" report... It seems to me
that SCAN is using some kind of heuristics (Aryeh?) and reports a
"generic" boot (or partition) virus each time when something seems
wrong with the boot sector(s) - like missing names of the hidden DOS
files, missing signature (0AA55h), etc. In your case the whole
contents of the boot sector has been destroyed, so its contents has
become obviously "abnormal". This has triggered SCAN's heuristics
(just a wild guess; I'm not certain that it is indeed so).

In your particular case, the crash might not be caused by a virus. It
might be a normal crash, or be caused by a buggy program... It's the
destruction of the contents of the boot sector that has caused the
report about the "Generic Boot Virus", not the "generic boot virus"
has caused the destruction...

I do have a copy of both variants of Involuntary, but the original

misleaded me. I have done a full search in my report files, instead of
a fuzzy one... :-)

Huh??? How can you achieve that?? As far as I know, the "year zero" in
MS-DOS is 1980 and you just cannot have a date before that... Speaking
about that, -how- do you know that the years have been in the 20th
century? The DIR command displays only the last two digits of the
year... Are you sure that the dates have not been from 2055 to 2065?

Well, that is reasonably easy to do.  However, what is really needed
is a way to find out if a given drive letter corresponds to a FAT or a
HPFS system.

F-PROT seems to work OK on HPFS systems (apart from problems with long
file names, like many other DOS programs), if it refrains from
scanning the boot sector.  This is on my list of things to do - but as
a temporary solution, just telling it not to scan the boot sector when
working on HPFS seems to work.

Glad you liked the program!   We're pretty proud of it.  I think
it's still the only OS/2 anti-virus program that has disinfection
features, an easy GUI interface, and all the rest.  Brag, brag!  *8)

The short answer to this is that it's an anti-virus program, not
a change-management or integrity-management program.  But that's
a cop-out.  We did test internally a program that showed you every
file that had changed (with hints as to which changes were most
likely to be a virus).  A few people liked it a lot, but most people
found it basically just noise.  Since programs change a *lot*, and
very very few of those changes are caused by viruses, people got
very tired of reading the change reports.  Most users didn't want
to know about a change unless it was caused by a virus.  They
didn't want to be told that SETVER.EXE had changed (because they
added a SETVER entry), or that 123.EXE had changed (because they
upgraded), or that their boot record had changed (because they
changed a volume serial number).

If enough people tell us that they want their anti-virus program
to also help with change management, we'll certainly consider
how to do that.  But in general change management and virus
protection seems to be mostly distinct; the vast majority of
changes are non-viral, and if you want to know about them
anyway it's probably because you have some other interest
besides viruses.

As usual, I'd love to hear from anyone who has different data;
if there are large classes of users who want to know about
every change on their machines, we'd like to help them, too.

That's it exactly.  If enough people also want to see an entry in
the log for every file that has changed, we'll look into making it
an option.  My fear is that, even if we say otherwise in big
letters, people will assume that if an anti-virus program even
mentions a file, that file must have a virus in it!  *8)

Well, maybe by "effective" Padgett also means "efficace" (sp?)
integrity checking? I mean, in Bulgaria I've seen a program, that
when run, used to modify COMMAND.COM of PC-DOS 3.30 in such a way that
it displayed the string "FluShot+ is STUPID! Press any key to continue"
and waited for a keypress each time the command interpreter was run...
This was achieved using tunneling techniques, so FluShot didn't detect
the modification of the file on-line. Furthermore, the file was
modified in such a way, that the (rather trivial) checksum algorithm
of FluShot+ didn't detect the changes... I can hardly call such
integrity checking "effective"...

Besides, Padgett does not claim that some company has suddenly
invented the integrity checking; all he says is that a company that
did not provide such features in their package, has finally decided to
do so... This is always good news; let's only hope that the integrity
checking provided will be secure enough...
