Subject: WARNING: New Macintosh virus (Mac)

		 New Macintosh Virus Discovered

Virus: INIT 1984
Damage: high
Spread: minimal
Systems affected: Apple Macintosh computers. All types.

A new virus, which has been designated "INIT 1984", has been
discovered on Apple Macintosh computer systems. This virus is designed
to trigger if an infected system is booted on any Friday the 13th in
1991 or later years. Damage from the virus includes changing the names
and attributes of a large number of folders and files to random
strings, and the actual deletion of a small percentage (<2%) of files.

The virus only infects system extensions of type "INIT" (also known as
"startup documents"). It does not infect the System file, desktop
files, control panel files, applications, or document files. Because
INIT files are shared less frequently than are applications, and
because of the structure of the virus code, the INIT 1984 virus does
not spread as rapidly as most other viruses.

As of the date of this announcement (3/19/92), we have only a few
reported sightings of this virus, including one from a site in Europe
and one from a site in the USA. In both cases, the virus caused
significant damage when infected Macintoshes were restarted on Friday,
3/13/92. Because only a few reports of damage were received, we have
reason to believe that the virus is not widespread. However, it is
conceivable that this virus might have affected Macintosh systems on
Friday 9/13/91 or Friday 12/13/91 without being recognized as the
cause of the damage.  If you think you may have been a victim of this
virus in 1991, please contact me via e-mail at spaf@cs.purdue.edu.


The current versions of Gatekeeper and SAM Intercept (in advanced and
custom mode) are effective against this virus.  Either program should
generate an alert if the virus is present and attempts to spread to
other files.

The virus affects all types of Macintosh computers. It spreads and
attacks under both System 6 and System 7. On very old Macintoshes
(those with the 64K ROMs), the virus will cause crashes at boot time.

Authors of all major Macintosh anti-virus tools are planning updates
to their tools to locate and/or eliminate this virus. Some of these
are listed below. We recommend that you obtain and run an updated
version of at least one of these programs.

Subject: Stalking the Wily FAQ

At long (!) last, the first draft of the FAQ (Frequently Asked
Questions) sheet is available for public release.  Thanks to all of
you who volunteered your time, effort, and patience to help out.  The
first release will be sent to VIRUS-L/comp.virus in the next
digest/batch of postings.

Whenever someone posts a question to VIRUS-L/comp.virus that is
covered in the FAQ, I will send a copy of the FAQ sheet in return.  I
hope that, over time, this will improve the quality of the group,
while still providing the necessary information for those that need
it.

Since questions change over time, so should the FAQ.  So, anyone who
wants to submit a Q&A for entry in the FAQ, please send it to me.
Likewise, if any questions in the FAQ are outdated, please let me
know.  The document is, in essence, a cache of questions and answers.

Finally, availability...  I'll get the FAQ loaded with the standard
file that goes out to new VIRUS-L subscribers.  However, since no
corresponding mechanism exists for comp.virus, I'll be posting the FAQ
periodically to the whole group, primarily for the benefit of
newcomers.  (Say, once a month?  Once every two months?)  In addition,
I will make sure that the most recent revision is always available on
our anonymous FTP site, cert.sei.cmu.edu (192.88.209.5) in:

pub/virus-l/FAQ.virus-l

(It's there now...)

Individual archive sites are, of course, welcome to keep their own
copy, as are bboards, individuals, etc.  Please, however, keep all of
the contact/credit information intact so that copies can be kept up to
date.

Subject: Telecom/Anti-tel (PC)

Can anyone enlighten me about this virus:

It has infected the boot-sectors of several diskettes yet i am unable
to find any infected programs. My understanding is that the virus is
spread by a memory-resident .COM infector, and that the
boot/partition-table infection will *not* spread by itself. Is this
right, or do i labor under a misapprehension?

(I have searched for the .COM infection after cold-booting from a
known-clean DOS diskette... so far, not a single infected .COM
file...!)  Secondly, the partition-table infection is alleged to do
horrible things after 400 boots. Where is the count of boots kept?
(Presumably in the partition-table somewhere, but where *exactly*?) I
would like to find this so i can try & develop some idea of how long
ago the infection occurred.

Thirdly, what does the infection do to 3.5 inch diskettes? Where does
the partition-table get moved to?

Subject: Michelangelo (PC)

In the March 16 Virus-L Otto Stolz asks the question: how can a
computer be booted after the double infection of first Stoned and then
Michelangelo.  I believe this was a rhetorical question in that Otto
has already figured out that it can't be.  In fact, this is where the
virus actually gives itself away in that the hard disk is no longer
bootable after a double infection.  In the scenario that I proposed:
first the Stoned infects a machine moving the MBR to sector 7 (at this
point the machine is still bootable), then the Michelangelo infects
the machine (copying the Stoned to sector 7 since it thinks it is the
MBR) now the machine is no longer bootable.  In both Viruses, however,
the partition table is not destroyed, only the partition program is
ovover written so the disk is still recoverable.  Also, the FAT table
is still intact and even if the partition table is destroyed it can be
reconstructed by physical ly lookin on the disk for the tell-tale
markers used to designate the beginning of a partition.  On my
collegues computer which was infected in this manner, it became
non-bootable and this is what alerted the user that something was
wrong.  Several antivirus packages were used to clean the disk, but
only NAV was able to actually clean the disk and reconstruct the MBR
and partition table.  That is not to say that all packages were tried,
but I know that a version of McAfee and CPAV were used to no avail.

Here are some observations on the Troi Virus. I hope this can help you
deal with it.  Since it is a new virus, I suugest that you identify
the infected files and replace them with clean copies from a backup.

- --
Virus Name:	TROI VIRUS
Discovered:	March, 1992
Symptoms:	.COM file growth; file date/time change; TSR
Isolated:	United States
Eff Length:	322-324 bytes
Type Code:	PRsC - Parasitic Resident .COM Infector
Detection Method:	Scan for string "The Troi Virus"
Removal Instructions:	Delete infected files

General Comments:

The Troi virus was received from Colorado in March 1992.  Troi is a
memory resident infector of .COM programs.  When the first Troi
infected program is executed, the Troi virus will install itself
memory resident as a low system memory TSR.  It will have hooked
interrupt 21.	Once Troi is memory resident, it will infect .COM
programs when they are executed.

Virus easy to detect because it changes the times & dates for infected
files.  On 3/3/92 a file with the date 1-1-1992 was changed to
0-0-2048 and a file with the date 10-31-1989 was changed to 0-6-2045.
Approximately 56 years is added to infected files.  The virus probably
checks the date of a file before infecting it.

The virus requests 165 paragraphs when becoming resident.

Infects .COM files, but not those with the read-only attribute set.
Trying to infect a file on a write-protected disk will produce the
"Abort, Retry, Fail?" error message.

F-Prot V2.02D detects the virus with a heuristic search with the
following warning: Program contains several features which are
normally only found in virus programs.  It is almost certainly
virus-infected.  Scan V86B identified only one of the infected files
as the Best Wishes Virus.  The two viruses (Troi and Best Wish) have
similar characterics, but whether the two viruses are related is only
conjecture at this point.  The size differences between the two are
significant.

It is trully a new virus because no other virus protection program has
the signature for it.  However, programs monitoring disk activity,
such as writing to files, will trap the infection requests.

It does not look like the Troi virus does anything besides replicate.

From:    Brian Seborg <seborg@brutus.ncsl.nist.gov>
Subject: Bogus report of Michelangelo in Neural Networks and Fuzzy Systems (PC)

Gene Spaffords comments on potentially damaging reports of viruses on
diskettes distributed with books also pertains to bogus reports of
viruses on any type of software.  I would like to propose a method to
prevent further bogus reports and that is as follows:

	1) When you get a new diskette from any source, the first thing you
	 should do is write protect it, if it is not already write protected.
	 On 5 1/4" disks I keep a role of electrical tape (the cheap plastic
         type) so that I can cut off a small section for this purpose.  It
	 never falls off (unlike those cheap tabs provided with many diskettes).
	 For 3 1/2" disks I make sure the switch is set so that I can look
	 through the write protect hole.

The rationale for doing this first is simple, if you then insert them
(the disks) into an infected machine, they cannot become infected.

	2) Scan the diskettes with your favorite virus scanner.  If the disks
     	 are infected, then you know the source was either the retail store
	 (since many take returns and re-shrink-wrap the software without
	 scanning them for viruses) or it the source was the software producer.

If the PC comes up infected at this time, you know you got the virus
from somewhere else given that the diskettes check out clean.  You may
have to modify these procedures for diskettes containing compressed
files.  But you can do this by simply scanning your PC to ensure that
it is clean before performing step 2, or before performing the
decompression and installation of new software.

This method has the added value of ensuring that you have sound legal
footing if in fact the software does come to you infected in that you
can show that you have a standard procedure which ensures that you
were not the source of the virus.

Subject: FDISK/MBR (PC)

In the March 16 Virus-L Michael Calanan asks whether FDISK/MBR can be
used in earlier versions of DOS.  My old Compaq MS-DOS version 3.3
manual in fact documents the use of FDISK/MBR for updating the MBR.
Therefore, I would imagine that this has been a feature of MS-DOS and
PC DOS since at least version 3.3.  No messages are given by this
command when it is invoked it only takes about a second or so to run,
and one is unsure that it has worked.  What I would suggest is to take
a computer you do not care about destroy the MBR by using Norton or
some other disk editor to write some bogus bits into it and then
attempt to use the FDISK/MBR program from whatever DOS version you
have.  My guess is that if you have version 3.3 or better this will
work resulting in your hard-disk becomming bootable again.

Let us know what happens.

Subject: November 30 virus? (PC)

Early last summer, a Korean customer informed me that he had found
"November 30 virus" on our distribution disks, using a Korean virus
scanner.  Further investigation proved that he had infected the
INSTALL.EXE on the distribution disk upon running it, as our
distribution disks were not write-protected at that time.  He had
found several other PCs in his company were infected with this
"November 30 virus".

At that time, I was told by several regular contributors to comp.virus
whom I contacted by email that there was no known virus named November
30 or known to trigger on November 30.  In a recent Hoffman VSUM
database, There is now a listing for a Jerusalem variant with a
trigger date of November 30, discovered in January 1992.

Perhaps this was the "November 30 virus" found early last summer in
Korea.

Subject: INFO wanted: BBS methods of virus detection (PC)

How safe is it to scan for viruses on a BBS.  I run a BBS, but I
usually take the line off-hook, shut down all my running programs
(including DESQview) and scan the uploaded files.  There are some
BBSes that scan the upload automatically as soon as it is recieved.
Is that safe?  Wouldn't the virus be able to infect the BBS program if
one is detected.  Depending on the type of virus of course.

Having everyone bring a formatted disc would increase the risk of
infection, as well. I think you'd need 3.3, 4.01, and 5. (For some
reason, Microsoft didn't bother to incorporate the DOS version or FAT
format information into the drives' FAT, which would have made life
a lot easier. This was a problem between 2.x and 3.x, as we.)

Haven't seen anything like this, but it shouldn't be too hard for someone
with DOS programming experience to write--just do track reads to build
the file, and track writes to create the new floppy.

Keep a master bootable disc from each version, and when it comes time
to distribute, DISKCOPY it to a distribution master, install the
anti-viral software on that, and DISKCOPY it to the distribution discs.
Unfortunantly, DISKCOPY doesn't have a multiple-output option, so it's
not necessarily the fastest method, but it'll work.

There are actually two DOS 5.0 commands that can be used here. The first
is the undocumented FDISK /MBR (or my more powerful FixMBR for all OS
versions 8*). This replaces the executable code in the MBR only. It does
not change the partition table values hence there is no need to search the
disk.

The second is documented and a switch on the UNFORMAT command, /PARTN, that
restores the partition table only (not the executable code). Unless you know
exactly what you are doing, this can corrupt the table so I recommend using
only as UNFORMAT/PARTN/L/TEST. L tells it to List the current data and /TEST
tells it not to make any changes. Use DOS 5.0 "HELP UNFORMAT" or see the
manual for more information.

Starting a boot record  on an even track boundary became a specification
of DOS 3.0 and was incorporated into PC-DOS (IBM) and MS-DOS FDISK at that
time though some semi-custom versions of DOS were not updated until much
later. Disks that were FDSIKed with the early version may also still have
this format despite having been updated to a newer DOS. Note that sector 1
head 1 track 0 is not always the 18th sector (depends on disk structure).

 I got hit by it, too.  I noticed it when it crashed an .EXE program
that I had renamed to .COM.  You can get rid of it by copying clean
versions of the programs over the infected ones.  If you know how to
use DEBUG you can repair the infected programs by finding the
beginning of the viral code, adding ten to that address, and copying
three bytes from the resulting address to the beginning to the program
(0100h).  That should inactivate the viral code.

 You can find all infected programs by searching for "The Troi Virus"
in .COM files.

FDISK /MBR only replaces the *code* in the master boot record; it
leaves the existing partition table alone.  So as long as the
partition table correctly describes your current setup (the best way
to test this, as Bill Arnold suggested, is to cold-boot from floppy
and make sure the hard disk looks OK from there), it will still do so
after FDISK /MBR.  Regardless of whether the partitions are single or
multiple DOS or non, etc.

Remember, of course, that the option is undocumented, and therefore
unsupported, and you should have good backups *first*!

One of the questions that appeared on this list was about Central
Point anti-virus programs, and Flip.  As a matter of fact, the Central
Point antivirus program does has the virus Flip as part of its
program.  Central Point indicated that they use this virus as a means
to detect other viruses.  F-prot detected that virus, we called
Central Point, and they confirmed the intentional presence of Flip.

Subject: TROI virus (PC)

A couple of people have mentioned that the TROI virus changes the
time/date of files that it infects.  While that's true of the version
that was sent to me, it's only because of the presence of a breakpoint
(INT 3, code CC) in the virus.  This was no doubt caused by someone
running the virus under DEBUG, and having a breakpoint set when the
virus copied itself.  Unless this was the original author, it means
that there's probably a version of the virus around without this bug.
The date-change is therefore probably not a reliable sign of the
virus, and people choosing signatures should be careful to avoid the
CC.  (The bug will cause files infected with this version of the virus
to malfunction in various ways, because the stack will be wrong; the
non-CC version of this virus will not have that problem.)

Subject: F-PROT warning: false positive? (PC)

I just tried scanning a program diskette using f-prot 2.02d; just to
see what would happen, I tried a heuristic scan of all files on the
diskette.  The program produced a long report, flagging all of the
text files as containing illegal instructions (reasonable), and ended
with an alert message saying it had found a stealth virus in memory.

I re-booted from a safe DOS 5.0 diskette and scanned the hard drive.
No viruses found, either with the full scan or a heuristic scan.

Is this a false positive, or should I be getting worried?  (The
diskette checked clean under the f-prot full scan.)

A related question: f-prot identifies nearly all the Norton Utilities
programs and several Microsoft Word programs as exhibiting virus-like
behavior, when the heuristic scan is used.  Is this also a false
positive?

It sounds like your user had multiple infections of Stoned and Azusa.

well the latest LINK virus I have heard of is SADDAM. I use VirusScan 5.32
which checks for Saddam, and Disaster Master 2. I have heard VirusScan 6 is
out though. Check for it. If you cannot find it I can uuencode a copy
of VirusScan 5.32 for you. Just leave me mail
