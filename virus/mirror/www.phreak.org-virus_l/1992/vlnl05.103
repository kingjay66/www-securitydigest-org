Subject: formatting system disks (PC)

   I would appreciate any feedback on this question that I have:

   I installed a memory resident virus detection program (Dr.PANDA)
recently and I just found a little problem (IMO): whenever I try to
format a disk on an external drive, the scanner kicks in and tells me
that a formatting attempt has been made and the scanner prevents this
from happening.  I have to deactivate the memory resident scanner
before I may try formatting a disk again .
   My question is this:
      If (hypothetically) there was indeed a virus in my system, and I
formatte a disk and made it bootable, would the virus (active) infect
the formatted disk (assuming it was a boot sector virus)?

   I understand the possibility of this question being brought up before. If
so, please send me a personal response at V$T6747@SRU (Bitnet).
Thanks in advance.

John,

	The following is the information that we released after some
modifications, for the University of Houston(Park) community on March/2/92.
I beleive that the problem that was encountered here was very similar to what
you were facing. Contact me if there was anything that I could do to help.

		Multiple Infection Problems(Michelangelo and Stoned)
		====================================================

	If your IBM_PC(compatible)  is being infected by both the Michelangelo
and Stoned, a reinfection by the Michelangelo would make the Michelangelo's
removal impossible.  This problem was first explained by Martin Zejma(8326442@
AWIWUW11.BITNET) from University of Economics Vienna(Austria).  This problem
was then checked and verified by the ACUS based on the available documents and
examination of both of these viruses.

	The pattern shown below, presents how the problem would gradually
develop.  Area one(Side 0, Track 0, Sector 1) is where the original bootsector
is being stored,  area two(Side 1, Track 0, Sector 3)  is where the Stoned viru
s
stores the original bootsector upon infection by the Stoned and area three
(Side 1, Track 0, Sector 14) is where the Michelangelo stores the original
bootsector upon infection by Michelangelo.


[ EVENT ]	  [ AREA  1]		[ AREA 2 ]		[AREA 3]
******************************************************************************

Original	   Original	   	   nil		  	   nil
  Disk		  Bootsector



Michelangelo 	  Michelangelo		   nil			 Original
 Infection							Bootsector
			|__________________________________________^



Stoned		  Stoned		Michelangelo		Original
Infection							Bootsector
		    |________________________^


Michelangelo	  Michelangelo		Michelangelo		Stoned
reinfection
			|_________________________________________^


	It could then be seen that upon the second infection by the
Michelangelo, the original bootsector would be erased.  When the antivirus
program is run, the Michelangelo would be shown on the bootsector(Stoned
would not be seen since at that point it is not on the bootsector).

	At this stage, by using an antivirus software, the Michelangelo virus
is then removed, which would be;



[ EVENT ]	  [ AREA  1]		[ AREA 2 ]		[AREA 3]
******************************************************************************

Michelangelo	   Stoned	   	Michelangelo	  	   nil
   Removal
		     ^______________________________________________|


	The antivirus program is run again, and the program will then show
an infection by the Stoned virus.  This would be the main indicator that
there is a double infection.

	Do not proceed  with the cleaning of the Stoned at this point and it
is highly recommended  that you contact the Academic Computing User Services
(ACUS) at 743-1587 or the Administrative Computing at 749-4911 so that a
consultant could help you on recovering your files.  The safest option at
this point is to bootup from a clean and protected floppy diskette and copy the
files from the harddisk to the other floppy diskettes. Note that you should
bootup from a DOS 5.0  bootable diskette, if you were using DOS 5.0 on the
harddisk.

	After the backup has been done, you may then proceed by reformatting
the harddisk.  Note that in general some bootsector viruses would survive the
total format by installing their code on high memory sectors and then they
would reinstall their code back on the newly created bootsector of the disk.
The solution to this is to simply bootup and issue the format command, from
a previously  virus checked and protected diskette.


	The reason behind above procedure is that after the Stoned is detected,
the removal  of Stoned would be;



[ EVENT ]	  [ AREA  1]		[ AREA 2 ]		[AREA 3]
******************************************************************************

Stoned	   	  Michelangelo	  	   nil			   nil
Removal
		     ^______________________________________________|


	When the antivirus program is run again the Michelangelo would be
detected, and removing Michelangelo would be refused by the antivirus program
since there is no original bootsector to replace it.  It is possible at this
point that the disk would be beyond repair(Due to the possible loss of the
file allocation table), however, if you are at this point, you may call the
ACUS or the Administrative Computing for help.  The SYS.COM can be used
in this case in an attempt to transfer back the system, in addition to some
other procedures that might be necessary to take to recover the files.  Those
procedures are beyond the scope of this briefing and should be handled by
our consultants only.


	The above procedure might be slightly different for the different
variants of the Stoned virus(26+ variants), which could make the recovery
procedures more cumbersome.  As always please note that having a backup
of your files is your best protection against computer viruses.

*************************************************************************
*************************************************************************

A friend of mine's machine recently stopped booting from the HD, so we
ran scan, and it reported that he was infected by Stoned.  We cleaned
that, ran scan again, and it reported that he was bitten by Mich.  We
tried cleaning that, and even though clean reported that it was
successful, upon rescan it was still there.  Even Norton Anti-virus
Michaelangelo didn't clean it correctly.  Any explanations and
solutions?

The short answers are
1. Nobody knows for sure.
2. Theoretically possible, depending on what program processes the data.
3. Little risk today.

1. All data is a "program" for some interpreter.  Showing that an
interpreter NEVER malfunctions for any possible input is a difficult
task.  So if a bad guy makes a floppy disk with a screwed up
directory, and gets you to DIR it, could it cause your OS's DIR
command to make a wild transfer into a data buffer?  Prove he
couldn't.. for all possible versions of DIR, for all possible
diskettes.

2. I have seen ill-formed data files cause word processing programs to
crash.  If they can crash they can make wild stores.  If they can make
wild stores they can overwrite code.  If they can overwrite code they
can drop a virus.  Many word processors, spreadsheets, picture
displayers, etc lack defensive code that checks all possible data
values before using them as indices or lengths.

3. As of today, nobody has reported such a program.  So the risk is low.

We should encourage software producers to write defensive programs,
and we should identify the ones that are weak, and we have to scan
everything.

Well done to Bill VanderClock & Harpreet Singh for their initial
investigation and analysis.  Did you have any special tools for this
or did you use debug?  I hope you don't have to do that too often.

Harpreet Singh (Singh_Harp@Bentley.BitNet) observed:

Most EXE infecting viruses damage Windows EXE files by either
overwriting the Windows portion of the program (in which case the
program size will not appear to change) or they correctly add to the
file but calculate garbage values for starting the host program.

Harpreet Singh asks:

Yes they can, if a memory resident virus takes active steps, like
this, to hide its presence then it is a stealth virus.  This would
make it much harder to perform the initial diagnosis, as you would not
see the 1k increase in file size that alerted you to the virus.

John R. Schutz (john@csrnxt1.ae.utexas.edu) reports:

The explanation is easy:
The PC was first infected with Michaelangelo (which is based closely on
Stoned), which placed itself in the Partition table sector (or Master Boot
Record - MBR) and moved the original to a sector further down the disk, and
things would apear to be normal.  When Stoned infected the system it did
exactly the same thing, but it placed the Mich virus in the sector that Mich
had already placed the original MBR - so now the original MBR is destroyed.

At boot time this would load & run Stoned, which would then load & run Mich,
but Mich will load & run Mich again, and again, ...  hence the PC failing
to boot.  Certain recovery software does not recognise the problem, so
it sees Stoned, and attempting to fix that it copies Mich into the MBR.
Run the software again and it now finds Mich but in attempting to repair
it it only finds the copy of Mich when Stoned infected the disk.  This
loop is as infinite as the failed boot.

Fortunately part of Stoned & Michaelangelo's attempt to disguise themselves
includes copying details of the first 4 primary partitions into the
infected MBR.  This allows DOS to find extended partitions, and means your
partition information still exists.

The solution is hard, unless you are using MS-DOS 5 in which case FDISK /MBR
should fix things for you.  Otherwise you will have some problems, what
you have to do is keep the partition information stored at the end of the
virus & match it with a suitable MBR partition table boot sector.  As
this seems to be a very common problem I shall write a small program to
assist & post it and details of how to use it over the weekend.

Hope this is clear,

Hi all,

	What would be the best line(s) of defense agianst viruses?  My
[limited] understanding is that at boot time a scanner and then a TSR
monitoring program.  Most AV software seem to have the two functions
built in.  Do the AV software also come with disinfectors or are they
separate packages ?
	Where do integrity checkers fit into the scheme of things ?
	Which are the "best" products for the different lines of
defense?  From where may copies be obtained (preferably UK sites) ?
	Communication welcome either via this forum or email.
	Thanks.

Due to some inter-human communication problems (other words for misunder
standing), I only heard yesterday why the problem is caused.

The description of the virus signature is limited to 30 characters,
TBSCAN is not quite helpfull in it's error message and the author
of COMPRSCA.DAT documentation was not pointed on this problem until now.

I really doubt that it's actually the game Moria. IT may have been
infected with a virus, did you scan it? Also where did your son get
this copy from? Since the source code is freely available I suppose
their is a remote chance someone put a trojan in and recompiled it.

I am glad that at last somebody in the West succeeded to activate
Starship (if only it is possible to be glad on this :-( )

It was me to supply Western anti-virus researches with Starship
samples.  I had got a sample more than a year ago. I had dissected and
analyzed it thouroughly.

>SO, DOES anybody have an explanation why this virus refuses to replicate

The virus refused to replicate on my PC by itself too. So I found out
the conditions under which it should:

    - there must be a RAM at segment 0BB00H (== 0B000:0B000; == 0B800:3000)
      It is a fourth (or third if counted from 0) text video page for
      CGA/EGA/VGA.
    - the active (bootable) hard disk partition must be a regular DOS one -
      e.g. less than 32 Mb.
    - 48 bytes at absolute location 0:4b0 thru 0:4df must be set to 0 or
      to any other same value.
    - BIOS must support int 13h, AH=08H - get hard disk parameters.

The only thing I did to get the virus to work on my PC AT was zeroing 48
bytes at 0:4b0 using DEBUG:
    debug
    f 0:4b0,4df 0
    q

Then I ran an infected sample and Starship successfully infected my hard
disk. The virus creates fake partition in the last 6 sectors of hard disk.

The virus goes resident and replicates only when booted from an infected
hard disk. It then infects .COM & .EXE files being created on either A:
or B: drives.

I copied several .EXE and .COM files from hard disk to floppy - they turned
infected. I sent them to Joe Wells, who reported he failed to get Starship
to replicate.

>last available absolute sector.So no currently available scanner
>should detect it, cause the MBR and the PBR remain uninfected, and the

There are at least 3 Soviet scanners (including my own, of course)
which detect and disinfect the virus for over a year already.

Subject: Starship (PC)

Vesselin Bontchev and David M. Chess write that the simple copy command
uses the 'create file' function (3Ch) of int 21h. It is expected to be that
way, but it isn't any more.
I inspected various PC / MS-DOS versions ranging from 3.2 to 5.00, and only
the ones before / including 3.3 use 'create file' in the COPY and XCOPY
command, since 4.00 an undocumented nice function (6Ch) is used , which accepts
a file name as input ( at DS:SI ) , and as output comes the handle in AX.
So simple copying won't work, and recalling your posting, Vesselin, it seems
that your test computer runs at least version 3.3 , too.

The possible variations of the virus when mutating are :

  4*2*3*16*2*2 = 1536 | (It seems I missed factor 16, last time :)

When asking about compilers, I naturally also meant linkers, but cause
most time I write in TurboPascal or TurboC , and these IDE's (nice
abbreviation) most time compile and link automatic, so I forgot the second.

BTW  Correction to Vesselin : 'cd02' should be 'cd03', sorry |

You appear to have encountered an entity called EM-Wurm.
Here is what I have been able to find out about it so
far :
   - EM-Wurm        (deliberately against EUROMAIL)
         doesn't survive reset
         always:
         writes in startup-sequence  $A0,$0A  (1st line)
         own Process: clipboard.device
         writes in c: $A0, length: 3888 Bytes (ASCII-Text available)
         writes in 5th Byte of c:protect (when available) $01
         Result: protect useless
         Damage routine:
         Works only when devices EM, EUROMAIL or EUROSYS are available.
         overwrites all Files in these directories with memory from MsgPort.
         In damaged files: from $BC text 'clipboard.device'.
         After that a pause of 3mins using dosdelay $259A
         After pause damage routine is called again.

I am not absolutely certain that this is what you have,
but it sure looks like it.

It's a minor point, but I believe that the proponents of the Sabin
Polio immunization system touted the fact that it used live "safe"
polio viruses because those "safe" viruses would spread to other
members of the family and neighborhood through normal human
(non-sanitary) contact, the same way that colds and the flu spread
among family members. The result would be beneficial because people
that had never been "officially" immunized would wind up immune to
polio.  At least that was the argument when those opposed to live
viruses balked at changing from the Salk vaccine, which uses dead
viruses.

I don't know if the proposed benefits actually turned out that way in
the last 30+ years since Sabin's method displaced the Salk method.
What is the current thinking? (Just a trivia question, I know this is
a computer virus group....)

Subject: Virus hides in printer (again)

New Scientist magazine suffered major injuries in the its recent 'revamp'/
'relaunch' losing several respected contributors and gaining an editorial
mess.  However it has again published a National Enquirer reject in the
Feedback column of the latest issue [No 1820, 9 May 1992]:

Theseer and wider to undermine peoplfidene in computers
and anti-virus products.  It is the duty of those of us who know better to
stomp on these stories.

I missed some of the previous debate on this subject, but my points for
refuting the story are:
1   Viruses need to propagate in order to spread, if
there is only ever
    one copy, (wherever it is), ipso facto it is not a virus.
2   Few, if any, printers have memory which can be read back by connected
    computers.
3   There is no mechanism in any pc operating system that will receive,
    store and execute data from a printer.
4   Such a viruscannot know all anti-virus software, so would have to
    move itself out of the computer while any program is run - therefore
    the computer is not infected anymore!
In summary such a virus would need cooperation from the printer and host
computer.  Coercing such cooperation would require parts of the virus to
be permanently in both machines, hence being present when anti-virus
software is used.

I have rung New Scientist 3 times already today but have been unable to
speak to anybody about this, however as I was typing this in they rang me
back.  They report that the original source for this story was Microsoft!
You certainly have my support if you stomp on Microsoft as well as the
story.

Subject: Anti-Virus Hardware survey


    Has anyone used any Anti-Virus Hardware products?

    I'm new to this newsgroup, so I'm not sure if there has been a
    discussion regarding Anti-Virus hardware -- but it would be great
    if someone could provide some detailed information about any
    hardware solutions that exist.

    It would be interesting to hear about how they work, how effective
    they are against file, boot sector and partition table viruses, and
    general pros and cons.

    If anyone has a good description, a comparision chart, or any
    information whatsoever about Anti-Virus Hardware --- I'd really
    appreciate it if you could mail it to me.

    If I get a good response, I'll be happy to post a summary on the
    net.

    Thanks,

Subject: Checklist part 13 (almost finished)



920508   PRTCKLD.CVP

             Antiviral checklist - part 13 (Lucky, eh?)

                         If infection found:

Once you find an infection, what do you do about it?

First thing is, don't panic.  Remember that a lot of viral programs
don't do any damage -- at least not intentionally.  While you should
not go blithely on as if nothing had happened when you find a virus,
don't overreact, either.  And, instead of focussing on the
immediately obvious problem of the infection itself, try to take a
few steps for future protection.

_ Send copy to recognized researcher

This step is vitally important, and all too often neglected.  Get a
copy of the virus.  Copy an infected program to a disk, or infect a
floppy disk with a boot sector infector.  The instant reaction is to
sweep it under the rug: that helps no one.  On the one hand, people
are afraid of the reputation of viri as being related to pirate
software.  However, if no one ever tries to find out how they spread,
how can we make the studies to determine this?  On the other, new
variants spring up all the time, and we need to track and trace these
mutations.

_ Isolate machine and disks

As mentioned, do not simply carry on as before.  The floppy disks
used in the machine are often neglected in the panic.  Remember that
the most successful of viral programs have always been boot sector
viri, and these are always spread by diskettes.

_ Perform minimal disinfection

Please let me stress the "minimal".  Do the *least* that you can do,
and still ensure security.  While there is some doubt as to the
wisdom of "disinfecting" of program files, it is surely better to
delete one file than to restore the whole directory.  It is better to
delete and restore one directory than to restore the whole disk.

And.  No one.  Ever, yet.  Has found a virus which requires a low
level format.  No LLFs.  Got that?

However, do perform a thorough disinfection.  Many people, while
going far too far in gouging an infection out of their workstation,
will fail to check out their floppy diskettes and backups.  One of
the most Frequently Asked Questions on VIRUS-L is "I cleaned off
Stoned but now it's back, how come?"  Easy answer.  You didn't check
your disks.

Also, with few exceptions, when disinfecting power down cold and
start fresh.  If you have a virus in memory, none of your
disinfection methods can be guaranteed, and some may even harm.

I will be giving a talk on viruses to the Bar Association shortly and a
selection of topical humor is welcome. I won't be able to use my large
collection of lawyer jokes, you see.

Complete the following in 50 words or less:

"Did you hear about the robot who got stoned?..."
"There was a young coder named Cyrus,..."
"A salesman, a manager and a programmer were sitting on a bus..."
"What do you get if you cross a virus with a ...?"

On second thought, maybe I'll go back to the lawyer jokes. What can they
do? Stone me?
