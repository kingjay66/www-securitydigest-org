Follow-up:

The tests were performed by Matias Jaenichen, using SCAN 97 downloaded
from oak.oakland.edu. The following viruses were used during the test:

	- Questo (1994 COM files)
	- CoffeeShop (2000 EXE files)
	- CryptLab (2000 COM files)
	- Dedicated (2000 COM files)
	- Fear (2000 COM files)
	- Pogue (2000 COM files)
	- Groove (2000 COM and 2000 EXE files)

Of the above viruses, CoffeeShop infects only EXE files, Groove
infects both, the others infect only COM files - this explains the
selection of infected samples. When infecting an EXE file, Groove
damages it with a probability of 1/512. Four of our samples turned out
to be indeed damaged. Currently only F-Prot is able to detect that a
file is damaged in this way.

During the tests, SCAN missed 319 samples, but since 2 of them turned
out to be damaged, I am not counting them. Therefore, SCAN missed 317
samples. More exactly, it missed:

	- 142 samples of Questo
	- 13 samples of CoffeeShop
	- 3 samples of CryptLab
	- 1 sample of Dedicated
	- 1 sample of Fear
	- 5 samples of Pogue
	- 154 samples of Groove (145 EXE files, 2 damaged EXE files, 7
COM files)

As you can see from the above, SCAN missed at least one infected
sample of EACH of the viruses. Therefore, the conclusion is that it is
UNABLE TO DETECT RELIABLY -ANY- OF THE MtE-BASED VIRUSES.

The missed samples occur relatively often - a set of 2,000 files is
not very large and is what the average user normally has on his/her
disk. (Just for comparison - I have ~15,000 files on my hard disk.)
Therefore, in a case of a serious infection (when the virus has
infected most files on the disk), SCAN 97 is likely to miss at least
one of the infected files, which is likely to cause re-infection.

Oh, BTW, all samples mentioned above were not modified in any way -
they contained the original, live virus (not modified or deactivated),
and were created in the normal way - we just let the virus infect.

I am currently trying to help McAfee Associates to fix the problem.
Let's hope that a future version will at least achieve reliable
detection.

I'll perform similar tests with other programs that claim to detect
the MtE-based viruses and will post the results soon. Meanwhile, both
F-Prot 2.05 and FindVirus 6.01 (drivers from 24 September 1992) were
able to detect ALL of the infected samples. Of course, this does not
prove that they are able to detect every possible MtE mutant - it only
shows that we were unable to find any MtE mutant that was not detected
by these two scanners. (FindVirus is from Dr. Solomon's Anti-Virus
ToolKit and is commercial. F-Prot is shareware, available from most
ftp sites, including ours.)

Subject: Key Press Virus & scan97 again (PC)

Well I solved my last problem by obtaining clean97. I also installed 
Vshield97 to stop the problem happening again.

BUT.....

My hard disk was cleaned with the last key press going with
whereis.exe as clean could not remove it. Two days later I used norton
disk doctor V5 to have vsheild cut in and say that the file was
infected and could not run it.  So I powered down, rebooted and
removed the virus. Scan 97 says there is no viruses present, but
whenever I run disk doctor key virus shows up.  so this Key Press
virus is hiding in an exe file and

scan 97 doesn't find it
clean 97 doesn't clean it
and vshield only finds it when the exe is run. 

And it's not a false alarm as if I run any other program after the exe, it 
also gets infected but scan97 does find and remove this. It almost seems 
that the virus is dorment and hidden in disk doctor and is activated on 
running the exe.

So the virus remains present and is still there. One way to remove it would 
be to remove the file, but this seems to be a different key press virus to 
any I've seen.

Has anyone had a similar virus?

why wil clean and scan not find it while vsheild detects when you run the 
exe?

Can anyone shead some light on this key press virus?

thanks

I have a slight problem concerning cleaning the form virus from my
hard disk and I was wondering if anyone out there could help.  I have
F-prot and McAfee v97 and both detect the virus on the disk, however
neither can remove it because they cannot find the old boot sector.  I
have DR Dos 6 and have installed SuperStor disk stacker (I suspect
after the virus infected the disk),but I presume the boot sector and
remainder of the virus program must be somewhere. Can anyone help? How
the hell to I get rid of it without having to backup and format the
disk????????

I can validate that report, as it was my work :-) The name
Terminator-II i decided to give to that virus, because none of known
me A-V program could recognize it.  But there is already several
"Terminator" viruses with different sizes : Terminator.526,
Terminator.918, Terminator.1501. All of them have nothing to do with
new virus, and therefore( by the way, there is a string inside virus
code "TERMINATOR") i decided to name it Terminator-II.  All technical
specification have been mentioned in my report, if you would like i
can repost it, or you can pick it on my board, or i can send it by fax
to you.

Hello Vesselin,

I'm sorry for long silence, had a lot of work to do, but i will send
you new Mte-related stuff as soon as possible.

Let me disagree with you, neither CatchMte nor Vdsfscan nor F-PROT
2.05 could get 100% hit rate in MtE detection in my test :-(. Also i
was confused when occasionally tested AVTK 6.0 on MtE "tester", it
also skipped some samples, but still i beleive that it's not a fault
of algorithm, but just a minor bug in i/o system of AVTK.

keep in touch

At this moment, my PC is also infected with V-sign.  I tried to use
F-Prot 2-05a to remove the infection but all I'm getting is this
message:

               Master Boot Sector Infection:  V-Sign !!
               This version of F-Prot cannot remove the virus!

Well, it is not verbatim but that is the gist of the message.  I tried
selecting either "Automatic Disinfection" or "Automatic Deletion" but
not one of them works.  When I check F-Prot Virus-Information, V-Sign
is not listed in there.

To anyone out there: if you know a way to help me rid of this virus,
please, please tell me!  I have $30,000 worth of PCAD, PSPICE and
other software packages in my PS/2, 386 computer, and I am in no mood
to do a low level format.

Also, should anyone of you know how to add a V-Sign signature to
F-Prot 2.05a, please tell me how.

Hello,

I am a consultant at UMass Amherst,

We currently run Vshield 97 upon boot-up on all of our PC's - 286's.
We frequently have students come in with a disk infected with STONED,
and we are always able to use CLEAN, to remove the virus. Recently, we've
had a two students arrive with Michelangelo on their diskettes - On two
separate days. Well, when I tried using CLEAN [Mich], I was given an error
message, saying that the diskette was bad. I tried taking a DIR of the disk, 
and it says Bad disk -- or somthing like that. I can't even format the 
diskette. I thought it was wierd the first time, but it has happened twice
now. 

BTW, they are 360k drives and diskettes.
Does Vshield set some kind of flag on the diskette, making it unreadable?
Is something wrong with Michelangelo?
Any answers would be greatly appreciated. You can post them here -- as I'm
always reading this group, or email me at cons067@titan.ucc.umass.edu

Thank you in advance,

Well, there is one potential problem.  FDISK /MBR does not touch the
partition table itself (bytes 1be-1ff in the MBR).  Of course, as most
boot sector viruses don't touch that table either, they can easily be
removed.  The problems start when the virus

  1) Modifies only the partition table - for example to create a new partition,
     and making it the loadable one.

     or

  2) Overwrites the entire MBR and uses "stealth" methods to make the original
     MBR visible to other programs. If you run FDISK/MBR with the virus
     active, it may not have any effect, as the virus could intercept the
     write operation.  If you run it after booting from a "clean" diskette,
     most of the virus body will be overwritten, but the table information
     may not be valid.

Fortunately none of the common MBR infectors belongs to either of those
categories.

Well, I am sure Vesselin will have something to say in reply to this [and
he has probably already posted a reply :-)], but the fact is that the
version of SCAN actually available to users at the time of testing did
not detect the MtE viruses perfectly, whereas other products did.

Normally this would not bother me - no anti-virus program is ever 100%
up-to-date anyhow.  However, what annoys me (no, make that "What upsets
me considerably") is a piece of advertising - from the UK, I think, claiming
SCAN to be in effect the "best and only" MtE-detector, when this is simply
not true.

It will only work on those MBR viruses that leave the partition table
data in place: stoned, michelangelo, Bloody!, and a host of others.
It will not work on those that either move the partition table data
(eg: Empire D) or encode the table data (eg: Monkey, but it moves 
the table too.)  The key* is to realize what FDISK /MBR does: it plops
the correct MBR code into place in sector 1, keeping whatever is at
offsets 1BEh - 1FDh (1FFh?).  If the correct table is found there,
then things work fine.  But if what is found there is a snippet of 
the (now dead) virus, the MBR code won't find a valid partition table,
and the bootup will crash.

One thing FDISK /MBR has over Norton's NDD (besides being a part of
DOS) is that it zeroes out the bytes between the last error statements
of the code and the first byte of the table, thereby solving the
"ghosting" problem common to MBRs fixed with NDD, where a (dead)
snippet of the virus left in that area will happen to contain the
strings searched for by common scanners.

>Will FDISK /MBR work for them all or are there any interesting "gotchas"
>using this method?

One obvious one, that always needs repeating, nonetheless: if the 
MBR virus is a stealth virus (eg: most of the Empire family) then
FDISK /MBR won't work if you booted from the (infected) hard disk,
since the virus won't let FDISK write to sector 1.

I've not heard of this happening before, which would lead me to
believe you have either a damaged host file or a variant of the virus.
However, without actually having an infected file to look at, all I

He doesn't need to re-install OS/2, I don't think.  Just issuing "BOOT
OS2" from the DOS session after the hard disk is clean should
re-create the BOOT.DOS file from the (now-clean) boot sector.

I recently got the McFee Scanv97 for Windows.  I'm running OS/2, but
when I want to run WSCAN I get the message that I cann't run the
program in a WINOS2 session.....

Any sugestions...

PS sorry I'm posting this article in the wrong group, but I thought
that I might reach someone using WSCAN97 on OS/2

Subject: Landmark legal ruling on software copyright

published today (10/22/92) in the San Francisco Examiner is the following legal
decision on disassembly of software (subject line is title of article):
- -----------------------(cut here)---------------------------------------
    "In the first binding ruling on the application of copyright law
     to a common process called reverse engineering, a federal appeals
     court said video game maker Accolade Inc. of San Jose could copy a
     video game system's code copyrighted by Redwood City-based Sega
     Enterprises Ltd. in order to design games for the Sega console.
     Reverse engineering is the parctice of taking apart a product to
     see how it works, and using the knowledge to design one's own
     product.  During the process, Accolade made a copy of Sega's
     encoded computer program, designed to exclude unlicensed game
     makers, in order to translate the information and extract the key
     to the code.  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal in San Francisco
     said the copying did not violate Sega's federally protected
     copyright on it's software package.  The court said Sega's
     exclusive rights over it's own programs did not entitle it to
     prohibit another company from learning how the Sega system worked
     and designing games that would fit it, as long as those games
     did not copy Sega games."

Subject: Scores virus (CVP)

HISVIRF.CVP   921016
 
                           Scores virus
 
The "Scores" Mac virus is very interesting for a number of reasons. 
I would, however, like to concentrate on two.  Scores is the first
virus which has a definite company and application as a target, and
of Mac viral programs, it definitely has the most interesting
programming.
 
I haven't kept the very earliest reports of the Scores virus, but I
believe it was detected very early in 1988, if not in late 1987.  It
baffled researchers, however, since, aside from reproducing, it did
not seem to carry any payload.  It was not until disassemblies and
studies of the actual code were done that it was found to be looking
for Mac "resources" identified as VULT or ERIC.  At the time, no
such applications were known to the general public.
 
(The first detailed account of the virus, including instructions for
disinfecting a system, was posted by John Norstad.  It is
interesting, going back over it, to see that at first he decided not
to write a disinfection program for it, since two others had already
been produced.  However, his reviews of the then current
disinfection programs turned up serious shortcomings in them.  This
may have reawakened his interest in producing the now widely
acclaimed Disinfectant.)
 
It wasn't until May of 1988 that EDS of Dallas finally spoke up. 
ERIC and VULT were identifiers of resources that were internal to
the company.  The company never did say whether the resources were
associated with a strictly internal utility, or if they had been
part of a project which never got released, at least not in that
form.  Whether utility or ill-fated application, it is clear that
the Scores virus was "aimed" at EDS.  It may be that the virus was
supposed to spread "into" the company, and then interfere with vital
internal applications.  Or, it may be that the virus was simply
supposed to lie in wait until a certain application was released for
general use.  Infected Macs would "misbehave", leading to
complaints, bug reports, or a bad name for the company generally.
 
One of the early copies of Scores studied was recovered from the
NASA HQ in Washington.  This led to reports of the "NASA" virus. 
Indeed, as late as 1991 I still saw reports in major IS trade papers
of how NASA had recently been devastated by the Scores virus as it
swept through, trashing hard disks and so forth.  (For those who do
not know, I take this to be error on the part of the journals.)  In
July of 1988, a Texas man was charged with computer related sabotage
and burglary, and it was reported, in error, that he was the author
of Scores.  In December of 1988, Apple sources were saying that they
knew who the author was, and the matter was int he hands of the
lawyers.  In December of 1990, it was reported that the Dallas
prosecutors office would be proceeding with charges, and reports of
damage were being solicited.  This was the last message relating to
the trial that I ever saw.

Subject: Call for Papers - The Third International Virus Bulletin Conference 

Amsterdam, 9th-10th September 1993

Call for Papers

The International Virus Bulletin Conference is the largest and most
prestigious annual event to address the computer virus threat in
Europe. The 1992 conference, held in Edinburgh, attracted over 200
delegates and 23 speakers, from more than 20 countries.

Abstracts of between 200 and 500 words outlining prospective papers 
for presentation at next year's Virus Bulletin conference are duly 
invited from all parties engaged in any capacity in combating the 
computer virus threat.

Papers will be selected for their originality and appeal to a diverse          
           
audience comprising corporate computer security staff, PC support              
    
specialists, hardware and software developers, government, military, 
public sector and corporate IT managers, researchers and others engaged 
in devising technical and procedural countermeasures.

Papers covering the following topics are particularly welcome:

* 	Case studies of genuine virus outbreaks.

* 	Post-attack recovery: tools, techniques and lessons learned.

* 	Evaluation methods and protocols for testing anti-virus software.

* 	Running a virus help desk.

* 	Protecting file servers.

* 	Dealing with viruses in compressed software.

* 	What should be in a virus hunter's toolkit?

The conference will be held in two streams: stream one will address the 
management of the virus threat, while stream two will concentrate on 
technical developments.

Abstracts should be completed by December 1st 1993 and should be sent to the
