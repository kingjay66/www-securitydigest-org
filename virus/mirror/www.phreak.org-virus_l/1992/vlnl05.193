Form is a boot sector infector (NOT a -master- boot sector infector),
so FDISK/MBR cannot be used to remove it. FDISK/MBR rewrites only the
Master Boot Record. It can be used to remove master boot sector
infectors like Stoned or Michelangelo, but not boot sector infectors
like Ping Pong or Form.

> F-PROT 2.05 and it still reported FORM as being present in the boot

Versions of F-Prot before 2.06a have a bug which prevents them from
removing the Form virus, if it has stored the original boot sector on
a track beyond track 255. Nothing will be damaged; F-Prot will just
refuse to remove the virus. Version 2.06 has the bug fixed.

Yes. SYS rewrites the two hidden DOS files AND the DOS boot sector
(where the Form virus resides), therefore it can be used to remove
this virus.

Yes. The two hidden DOS files must fulfill the following conditions:

1) Their directory entries must be the first two in the root
directory.

2) The files must come in that order - first the IO file and then the
DOS file.

3) The must occupy the first clusters on the disk and all their
clusters must have consecutive numbers. That is, the files must not be
fragmented.

In DOS 5.0 the restrictions are not so strong. In fact, there is only
one restriction - the directory entries of those two files must be in
the first sector of the root directory. The files themselves can
reside anywhere on the disk.

This might not be sufficient. Just deleting the files will leave
exactly as much space as they used to occupy. If SYS refuses to
install DOS on a particular volume, it is because this space is not
sufficient... I would advise you either to upgrade to DOS 5.0, or to
use a third-party utility (e.g., Norton's Disk Doctor) to "make the
disk bootable".

I already posted a (longish) test of SCAN 99 for MtE-detection. I
would like to shortly emphasize an important point here.

Users who are suspecting an infection by an MtE-based virus, must run
SCAN 99 with the /A option. Only with this option it achieved reliable
detection of the MtE-based viruses in our tests. This is not mentioned
in the documentation, and without this option SCAN 99 misses about one
infected file in every 15. This happens only with the Fear and Questo
(and possibly Insufficient) viruses; the others are always detected
reliably, even without the /A option.

Also, SCAN 99 is not able to scan networked drives any more - you must
use NETSCAN for that. A pity; SCAN 97 -was- able to scan networked
drives... :-(

See the FAQ about information how to report such cases. In this case,
it is difficult to help you, because you don't say WHICH scanner you
have used to detect the virus and WHAT version of the scanner it
was... :-( It seems that you have used some version of McAfee's SCAN,
but I am not certain about it...

Well, it's normal to find such strings in a DOS utility, no?

It seems that your information is from VIRLIST.TXT, in which case it
means that you have indeed used SCAN. Sorry, the information is wrong.
There's no such thing as "the DAME virus". There is a library (called
MtE, by the way), which can be used to make extremely polymorphic
viruses. Several such viruses already exist, but none of them is fully
stealth. They are all -polymorphic-, but VIRLIST.TXT has no field for
that information...

Mode is about 14 Kb in MS-DOS 5.0. You are probably confusing it with
MORE.COM, which is about 3 Kb (it used to be 300 bytes in DOS 3.30...
sigh...).

In any case, you probably have a false positive. I suggest that you
report it to the producer of the scanner used by you. If you have used
SCAN, I strongly advise you to upgrade to version 99 - the previous
ones are unreliable in detecting the MtE-based viruses.

It's up to Mr. Slade to reply to this, of course, but I personally got
the impression that he lists mainly public domain and shareware
products...

Or do you mean his product -reviews-? Well, have you send him a copy
of your product for evaluation? If you did, it would be really nice to
see a report about it - from my own experience, it's an excellent
resident integrity checker (integrity shell, according to your
terminology), although it's rather clumsy to install and maintain,
especially by inexperienced users...

Uhm, forgive me, but the first time when I saw the name of your
company, I thought "Ha, what does Fred Cohen have in common with the
Association of Shareware Professionals? Is his product shareware?"...
The name of your company sounds very confusing to those who have
experience mainly in the BBS world...

Well, most of the bug reports are by people who have found them; not
by the producers of the products... :-) IMHO, it's a good idea to
share such knowledge with the other readers of Virus-L/comp.virus, so
that they are warned about the bug...

Besides, nowadays most progressive software producers tend to provide
some kind of support for their products on the net - this is cheaper
both for them and for their customers...

Your product is excellent from the security point of view. I would
just like to see it with a better user interface. And if you make it
shareware and upload it to a few ftp sites, that will be a real bonus!
This way it will reach much more users...

Currently I have seen only two shareware integrity checkers that are
worth the disk space they occupy - Integrity Master and VDS.
Unfortunately, neither of them is as secure as your product. On the
top of that, VDS is incompatible with user-installable volumes (e.g.,
Stacker, DiskReet, DiskManager), and Integrity Master creates one
files with checksums in -each- directory containing executable
files... :-(

Dr. Cohen, it is statements like the above that are damaging your
reputation... Do you -really- mean that your company has created 
1500 new viruses? Do you understand how it will be interpreted by 
the average person/journalist?

Furthermore, at least -you- must know that the scanners are able to
detect only -known- viruses, therefore testing them with -new- (i.e.,
unknown) viruses is an extremely silly idea... Or are you trying to
sarcastic in some subtle way that I fail to understand? If this is
the case, what is the probability that LOTS of other people will
misunderstand you too?

Hmmm... Which version of SCAN? SCAN 99 never reports such name when
run on our virus collection. Also, no such name is listed in
VIRLIST.TXT. On the top of that, I have never heard about a virus with
this name... Maybe Aryeh can comment?

Aren't some PC manufacturers using Flash-RAM or EEPROM these days for
holding BIOS code? Certainly there are modems around [Zyxel?] which
utilise EEPROM and not ROM, so the manufacturer can make firmware 
upgrades and bug fixes available on their BBS.

This would certainly seem to be more user-friendly -- and much more

interlock could be used to ensure that subversive BIOS reprogramming
could not be carried out [a simple push-button would do -- most viruses
don't have fingers :-)].

We are both wrong, I recently downloaded version 5.01 from Simtel20...
:-) I haven't played enough with it yet, but from the description it
seems that this is a BIG improvement on the previous versions of the
product.

It is now a full-featured package, containing all known kinds of
anti-virus defense: scanner, resident scanner, integrity checker,
resident integrity checker, monitor, boot sector/CMOS save/restore
program, heuristic scanner, heuristic remover, generic remover, file
wiping, bulk disk on-the-fly encryption... Having in mind that the
same company also sells hardware virus protection, this makes the
list pretty complete... About the only thing I did not see was an
access-control system, a backup program, and a virus-specific
disinfector...

BTW, the integrity checking seemed -very- weak to me, but I have not
tested it completely... On the other side, the generic disinfector is
a very nice idea and sounds very promising... I have not seen anything
like this implemented yet... No, it's different from the "generic
remover" in Untouchable (which I tend to call "heuristic remover"),
although this is a feature also present in the package...

No, thanks. I am not going to spend that much effort, when I can just
use another user-programmable scanner (HTScan), which can work with the
same signature database, supports an even more flexible signature
format, and does not spit its heuristic opinion in the report
files... (Not that it is without drawbacks; if only I could turn off
all these stupid warnings about the incorrect file date/time or if at
least I could exclude them from the report files...)

Besides, if I -really- need to use TbScan's report files, I would
rather write an awk script to sieve out the reports about "unknown
viruses", instead of wasting my time to write my own scanner, using the
resident scanner's API... But I doubt that I'll do even this, just to
test the scanner... I have a policy to tend to refuse to test
products, which are "not suitable for testing"... :-)

Oh, I see, I was confused that you have actually LZEXE'd them... But
then, F-Prot doesn't claim to be able to scan inside files converted

LZEXE, PKLite, Diet, and ICE...

In fact, the term "encryption" is incorrectly applied to viruses. They
do not encrypt themselves (except maybe Cheeba, which uses a trivial
kind of Vigenere cipher to encrypt its payload); they -encode-
themselves. Converting a COM file to EXE format is a kind of encoding,
because you change the entry point "look alike"...

Hmmm... F-Prot prints a question mark on those replicants of the
MtE-based viruses, which are not encrypted...

Oh... It's, of course, up to Frisk to answer to this, but it indeed

Maybe because none of the known MtE-based viruses increases the file
size by more than 5 Kb?

Don't know about NDD, but FDISK/MBR (in DOS 5.0 only) does remove it.
Just don't forget to cold boot from an uninfected write-protected

A very good list of virus signatures is maintained by Jan Terpstra. it
can be obtained from Simtel20 or its mirrors, e.g.

	oak.oakland.edu:/pub/msdos/trojan-pro/vsig9210.zip

"The way to use it" is either of the two user-programmable scanners
that support this signature format - TbScan or HTScan. They can be
obtained from the same place, same directory. The archive names are
tbav501.zip and htscan19.zip respectively.

Also, a very good list of virus signatures is regularly published by
Virus Bulletin. It can be used (after some editing) by HTScan.
However, I am not aware of this list being available in electronic
form.

SCAN is wrong (as usually) on the identification of this virus. It
even does not belong to the Jerusalem family. Just take a look at the
way it infects the COM files - it appends itself to them, while all
Jerusalems are prependers...

Yeah, those are the sad consequences of lack of exact virus
identification before trying to disinfect a virus... SCAN is extremely
poor on identification. CLEAN does some additional checks, but even it
is far away from exact identification... While exact virus
identification on scanning only is not that essential, failing to do
it on virus removal means a risk to destroy the user's data, as your
test are demonstrating...

Subject: CatchMtE update (PC)

Hello, everybody!

I just received a new version of CatchMtE - 1.8. According to the
author, the old version has a bug which sometimes (very rarely)
prevents it from scanning some specific COM files for MtE-based
viruses. I wasn't able to find the bug in our tests, but after all, we
used only about 16,000 MtE samples... :-)

Anyway, the new version has been put on our anonymous ftp site. It can
be reached as

	ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de:/pub/virus/progs/catchm18.zip

Users of the older versions are urged to upgrade. I would also
appreciate if maintainers of the other archive sites that carry
anti-virus related stuff obtain this program too and make it available
(it's freeware), in order to reduce the load on our slooooowwww
communication line... :-)

Vesselin

Subject: Is this a new virus? (PC)

One PC at our site has a strange virus and we're not sure whether
we've got rid of it or not.  Here's what happened:

- - The system hung during booting from the HD, displaying two colorful
patterns on top of the CMOS screen.

- - A clean boot from floppy would allow access to the HD as ussual.

- - McAfee Scan 97 detected [Stoned] but Clean couldn't find it.

- - F-prot 2.05 found Stoned and removed it.

- - A second run of F-Prot found Michaengelo but unable to remove it.

- - Scan also found [Mich] but also unable to clean it.

- - Fdisk /mbr did get rid of the Michaengelo look alike and the system
reboot successfully from the HD. F-Prot and Scan then gave the system
a clean bill of virus.

- - Scanning all the floppies used on this PC shown one infected with
michaengelo, boot the system with this disk would get us back to the
beginning.

So would anyone please tell me what virus is this one, thanks.

(will report more behavior of this virus if noone can identify it)

The DOS SYS command can be used to overwrite the boot sector of
infected disks to remove the virus.  Afterwards, run the DOS CHKDSK /F
command to recover any clusters marked as bad by the virus (if using
DOS 5.00, make sure your disk can have CHKDSK /F run safely on it, or
upgrade to MS-DOS 5.00a).

What you'd like to see in an Integrity Checker is certainly reasonable.

I think, you've probably already got everything that your asking for <g>.

Integrity Master has always allowed you to keep your integrity data on
a diskette (but I guess you known that).  Integrity Master has had an
option to exclude specific files and directories ever since release
1.21a (June 92).  Although Integrity Master will scan memory for known
viruses, I strongly encourage cold boots.  As a matter of fact, when
you install, Integrity Master's will suggest cold boots if you
indicate virus checking as your purpose.  It presents this on screen
and also in the customized check list that it prepares for printing or
viewing.

	Scan 99 detected "Filler" active in the memory of my computer.
When I booted from a write-protected floppy the nasty virus was not

constantly running and it did not detect anything wrong.
	Does anybody know anything about Filler ?
	What can I do to get rid of the virus ?

No. Well, maybe not forever, but as far as there are no native 32-bit
viruses (I have never heard of any of these) this will not
benecessary.  The only problem is that if you have an active DOS
session, you might have to close it to eliminate a possible memory
resident virus.

I've noticed many PC clone vendors are shipping motherboards with
flash BIOS chips.  These can be updated by the user (according to the
ads).  How susceptible is this arrangement to a virus attack?  This
may be a naive question, as I have not seen one of the machines (yet).
Perhaps the set-up prevents unauthorized modifications?

This is not a virus, just the Logitech mouse CLICK program,
interfering with the format command. As near as I can tell, everything

Subject: Right Said Fred

For once I have to agree with Fred regarding his comments about the use of
this board by some vendor's as a user support service.  I also agree with
the point about making the criterion of virus testing known so that it 
can be replicated (I think Vesselin did a good job in his recent MtE
report, Rob, were you paying attention?).  I disagree with some extent
to his implication that zoo testing is not useful by his bringing up ASP.
Specifically, I think that since most users do not have access to zoos of
viruses which would allow them to make their own decisions, it is necessary
for those who do to test the claims of anti-virus producers.  I think if a 
company puts out a press release which says that they can detect MtE based
viruses, then they damn well better be able to prove it.  If they do not
stand up to tests, then they are negligent in their own quality control if
not outright guilty of false-advertising.  I do agree that a reality 
check needs to be applied to zoo tests in order that users can assess how
meaningful it is for them that an anti-virus product can catch the Coffee-
shop virus versus how important it is that it catch the Stoned or Jerusalem
virus.  But there is also something else which needs to be observed.  If an
antivirus product is unable to detect the MtE viruses dependably, then one
has to ask whether that company may have reached its technological limits.
If you miss it, then are you missing a more fundamental skill?  Have the
limits of understanding been met?  If so, get out of the business.  This
lack of capability speaks of the R&D departments not keeping up with the 
bleeding edge.  Fred is right, Scanners are not sufficient, products based
on integrity are necessary.  There is only so long that string based scann-
ers can keep up, and perhaps MtE has sounded the death knell for many of
those who have fallen by the way-side.  Scanners should be a line of
defense, or a tool in the arsenal, but we need to move to integrity based
products in order to have any chance of keeping apace with the current 
spread of new and hard-to-detect viruses.
