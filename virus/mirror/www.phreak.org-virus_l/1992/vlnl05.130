Subject: Various Qs (VirusCure, F-PROT, DIR II, UNIX) (PC) (UNIX)

Hi, everybody.  This is the first message I send to you.

Just some questions:

  -  Has anyone in the net ever heard of the IMSI antivirus product
     VirusCURE PLUS 2.37 (march 4th, 1992)?  It's documentation
     says that it is developed in association with McAfee, but
     VirusCURE detect less strains than ViruSCAN.  VirusCURE
     detects the DIR-II -"Creeping Death"- virus, which is widely
     spread here in Costa Rica, but is yet unable to disinfect it.
     Fortunately, since Clean89 release, it is getting under
     control.

  -  I've tried Fridrik's F-PROT 2.02D & 2.03A but it cannot scan
     the infected files ("Error reading <filename>"), so the virus
     is not detected.  Using Norton's DiskEdit I made a copy of the
     virus code into a new file called DIR2.COM in the same floppy
     disk and ran F-PROT again.  I got the same result with the
     infected files, but F-PROT identified the virus in the new
     file; however "Virus could not be removed".  OK, but F-PROT
     did not try to do so:  there were no more disk access after I
     answered 'Y' when asked "Disinfect (Y/N) ?".  Is it fixed in
     newer versions?

     I've studied DIR-II code with some detail.  Amazing.  Do you
     know that DIR-II cannot activate in MS-DOS 5.0?  I've heard
     that DOS 5.0 was totally rewritten from scratch in order to
     eliminate many bugs and make it more efficient.  When an
     infected file is run, DIR-II reuses some code in low memory
     (DOS kernel, I think), but returns to the prompt if DOS is
     loaded low (by means of Int 20h), or crashes the computer when
     DOS is loaded high.

     However, I think that the disinfection procedure is relatively
     simple, in comparison with those viruses that attach to the
     executable files, once the file first-cluster number decoding
     formula is known.

  -  I need information about Unix viruses and antivirus products.
     Could anyone give me information about, or tell me where can
     I find it?

  -  Finally, has anyone heard of Windows-specific viruses?

Thanks a lot,
Fabio Esquivel - fesquive@ucrvm2.bitnet

I am using a ibm compat with dos5 the system is protected with vshield93
when i tryed to run xtgold i recieved a message that the xtgold.com
was infected with PS10 virus I then scanned the disk with vscan93 which
reported no infection Mcafees virus list does not say any thing about
ps10 yet vshield picked something up
if any body has any information on this could you please drop a line

Yes.  No.  No.  Seriously intended to do both, but "twas too much trouble"
or so I thought.  I did wipe out everything I knew I wouldn't use, but
left intact Norton, WordPerfect, Procomm Plus, and a couple others I thought
I ought to keep because I might use them someday (Microsoft C...).

Quite.  Probably will never know.

>Did you scan it immediately upon purchase?

Yes.  F-Prot (Feb. 1992 version) said no problems.

>Did you ask the seller for the manuals and originals for all that neat

Yes.  The thing is, he got most of his stuff from work.

>Did you happen to run any of that stuff for the first time right before

The only things that I ran for the first time right before the
problems were two freebies: one was a graphics demo I got from garbo,
the other was the Screaming MeMe Hypertext magazine I got from a
friend, who got that from a bbs in his area.  The demo checked out
okay, but the Hypertext viewer HYPE.EXE *was* infected... it could
have just been passing the infection back to me...I had given him a
bunch of text files and LIST.COM a long time ago.  He didn't get
around to using it until the day he gave me MeMe.  He ran and then
Zipped MeMe *after* running LIST so I could have passed the virus to
him via LIST first, or perhaps he had the virus beforehand and I got
it from him.  Both of our systems had problems at the same time.

Thanks for the recommendation, but I would like to point out that F-PROT is
not exactly free.  The english language shareware version is free of charge
for PRIVATE USE ONLY.  I ask a very modest fee in other cases, but there is a
significant difference between a low fee and no fee at all.

Then of course there are several translated, commercial versions available
in several European countries, which are just distributed as regular
"shrinkwrap" software.

I have no proof, co I cannot name the company yet, but I suspect that
pre-formatted 3.5" 1.44MB disks from a *major* diskette producer are
to blame.

This cannot be proven until a sealed box, with infected diskettes is
located, however.

No, I delayed the release of 2.04B, because of an enormous flood of
new viruses - I plan to cover around more (in addition to the 50 or
so, that I have already added).  I sent out one single copy of 2.04b
to a person who needed it to disinfect a virus that 2.04a could only
detect, but not remove, but 2.04b has not been officially released
yet.

Well, I'm not surprised - I miss it too. :-)

Actually, I am not convinced this is a legitimate mutant of Whale -
this is just a single sample floating around under the name of
WHALE#33.COM, but structurally it is different from all the others.

However, the reason I have not added detection of it is simple - I
just cannot get it to work, and I have a suspicion this may simply be
a damaged file.

I would like to know what exactly the Spanish Telecom virus does.  I
have found an infested laptop computer (Toshiba) with it on.  As I
work in a large University Department I would especially like to hear
from other people who may have experienced this virus.  Does The
Dr.Solomon Tool kit deal adequately with this particular virus?  I
have just sent of for the latest version.  Any general advise to try
and track this virus down too?  I have at least 2 infested floppy
which are hit too.

Subject: McAfee Products (PC)

	Lately I have been seeing a number of questions involving
McAfee Associates use of the [GEN-P] and [GEN-B] identifiers with
reguards to low-level viruses. Earlier we were greeted by such cryptic
identifiers as NO-INT [STONED]. The reason is that the identifier in
brackets merely indicates to CLEAN what method it is to use to remove
the virus. If an MBR virus stores the original MBR in sector 7, the
STONED removal method is apt.

	Lately, there has been a more disturbing trend to leave off
the explicit identification and identify whole families of viruses
simply as [GEN-P] (GENeric-Partition). Since IMHO it is important for
those cleaning up after infections to know what it is they are dealing
with once an infection has been identified, I sincerely hope that this
trend will not continue.

					Warmly,

ChinaTalk is a Trojan Horse, not a virus.

Disinfectant does not attempt to deal with Trojan Horses, only viruses.

There will be no new Disinfectant release to deal with ChinaTalk.

The current version of Gatekeeper is 1.2.6, released 9 July 1992.
Version 1.2.2 (released 26 January 1992) introduced some changes for
compatibility with System 7 Tune-Up.

To get the most benefit from the use of anti-viral software, it's
extremely important to use the latest versions. Gatekeeper 1.2.6 is
available by anonymous ftp from all the usual places, including rascal

Subject: Resolution of 'what to do about virus distributors'

about a month ago I posted a message asking for input on how to deal
with a BBS system that was distributing viruses.

Legal recourse was essentially a dead end.  The problem was resolved
by applying peer pressure :-) Running a BBS system is, for many, an
ego oriented experience and this is one of those cases.  Finding that
several of the places he frequented no longer consider him a
worthwhile human being apparently caused him to rethink things.  (Or
at least make his indescretions private and unadvertised...)

Cheers,
Jan (Jmaaskant@uthscsa.edu / jan.maaskant@f255.n387.z1.fidonet.org)

From:    Ian Leitch <uqak940@ucl.ac.uk>
Subject: Book Review

Publications about viruses and other computer crime often seem either
to be technical material designed to assist professionals or to be
popular "hype" which mis-leads the general public. I was pleasantly
surprised recently to read a new book written in simple, non-technical
language to give the layman a comprehensive view of data crime.

It is called "Approaching Zero" (the subtitle of "Data Crime and the
Computer Underworld" is more meaningful) by Bryan Clough & Paul Mungo,
Faber & Faber, ISBN: 0-571-16546-X, cover price of 14.99 pounds
sterling.

This readable book presents detailed accounts of actual incidents of
phreaking, hacking, virus writing, and other keyboard crime. Although,
the main purpose is to describe the actions and motivations of the
perpetrators, these are interwoven with the reactions of the victims,
the police and legal authorities, and the "good guys" (such as some of
virus experts who contribute regularly to this list).

Although written like a popular novel, it conveys many factual
details. In illuminating the largely unknown world of the computer
underground, it dispels many of the widespread myths about it. The
authors show a healthy sceptism for many of the claims that are
commonly heard; they see their mission to describe (rather than to
propose remedies). However, they issue an extreme warning about the
direction events are taking: the expanding volume of computer crime,
particularly the growth and diversity of computer viruses, will cause
huge numbers of computers to "Zero out"; after all, the technology and
means to wipe out computer systems already exist.

The table of Contents is:

    Phreaking for Fun
    Breaking and Entering
    Data Crime
    Viruses, Worms, Trojans, Bombs
    The Bulgarian Threat
    Hacking for Profit
    The Illuminati Conspiracy
    Crackdown

Finally, for those who like to read such books in their native tongue,
the publisher's blurb says that editions are being prepared in Spanish
and American English.
