Subject: preliminary Groove analysis (PC)

   Hello everybody,
   we have done a quick analysis of the "Groove" virus, and would like to
   share this information with you.
   ---------------------------------------------------------------
   Suggested Name: Groove
   Type          : polymorphic, memory resident COM & EXE infector
   Unusual features: This is a "directed" virus that targets data files
                   used by certain anti-viral programs (see below).
                   It uses Mutation Engine to implement polymorphism
   Damage/Payload : deletion of certain files (see below)
   Interrupts    : INT 21h, LOAD/EXEC subfunc (4B)
   hooked
   RU-there call : mov  AX, FBA0h
                   int  21h
                   cmp  AX, 0ABFh
                   jz   virus_is_resident
   Scan string    :   8e d2 8b e3 8e d8 b8 a0 fb cd 21 3d bf 0a 74 5f
   (plaintext only)

   Date/Location : June 1992, U.S.A.
   Comments      : This is the first COM & EXE infector that uses the
                   notorious MtE. Although, it will display a message
                   saying that it's a research virus, it is in fact a
                   destructive, directed virus that erases the following
                   files:
                      C:\NAV_._NO
                      C:\NOVIRCVR.CTS
                      C:\NOVIPERF.DAT
                      C:\CPAV\CHKLIST.CPS
                      C:\TOOLKIT\FILES.LST
                      C:\UNTOUCH\UT.UT1
                      C:\UNTOUCH\UT.UT2
                      C:\VS.VS

                   The virus makes 5 passes to delete each one of these
                   files using INT 21h/subfunc 41h. The file attribute is
                   first cleared in case it is READ-ONLY.
                   On PCs with a real-time clock (INT 1Ah), it displays
                   the following message after 12:30 midnight:

                      This Virus is NOT dedicated to Sara
                      its dedicated to her Groove (...Thats my name)
                      This Virus is only a test Virus therefor
                      be ready for my   Next  Test ..

                   On systems with no RTC, the message is displayed every
                   time a file gets infected.
                   The virus installs its own INT 21h handler and monitors
                   LOAD/EXEC (4b) function as well as its RU-there call.
                   It only check if the loaded file is an EXE-type file
                   by looking at the first two bytes of the file. If they
                   are 'MZ' or 'ZM', it assumes the victim is an EXE-type;
                   other files are infected as COM files. Note that it
                   does NOT check the extension of the file name.
                   To determine if a file is infected, it compares the
                   word at INVERTED_CHKSUM field of the EXE header to
                   a value of 0FBA for EXE-type files, and checks the
                   6th and 7th bytes for BA and 0F respectively for
                   other files. The program entry point is modified
                   to transfer control to the virus which is attached
                   to the end of the hosts. At this location it contains
                   a decryptor generated by MtE (unless it is a null
                   decryptor). Once the virus is decrypted, it checks for
                   memory residency. If not already installed, it will
                   directly manipulate MCBs to reserve 140h paragraphs
                   of memory (about 5K). It copies itself over to the
                   new location. The virus is about 3K including the MtE.
                   File sizes will grow in variable amounts due to MtE.
                   It installs a new INT 21h handler using direct memory
                   reference to IVT. After that, the damage routine is
                   called.
                   Infected programs will not function properly, and this
                   gives away the presence of the virus. This is just
                   another badly written virus that relies on MtE to evade
                   easy identification. Fortunately, it is too buggy to be
                   of any significant threat.

  No one suggested otherwise. The point remains that it had a 0% hit rate.
I did not find any reference to this weakness in the documentation.

   Could be a good idea. Having a partial scan, and a complete scan makes
more sense.

   The 3 that were completely missed were encrypted and working
mutations of Pogue. Just with MtE added? Well, that's the whole
problem. People will modify viruses and use MtE to make them
polymporphic. If you cannot detect MtE reliably, whether they are
based on a lowly virus is irrelevant. What's so difficult about using
a string for plaintext Pogue mutations at least?

   Wrong in what sense? The test results are not speculation. They
revealed 3 (actually more after other tests) that were missed. They
were all of the same type. We now refer to these as single-reference.
By "heuristic", I did not mean your heuristic scanning method.
"Heuristic" as in "does not always work" :-)) What I used to call
Method-3 is an algorithm that reliably recognizes this type of
mutations in every case.

   Might be helpful, but I speculate that it will not be sufficient :-)

  Now that I can understand. We spent a good week on dissecting it.
It's not trivial. You can disassemble a virus to find out how it is
infecting files, boot sectors etc. With a little practice, it becomes
easier and can be done quickly. In the case of MtE, however, you will
have to go further than that. Forget hex dump, forget raw ASM output.
Binary-level analysis is necessary for 100% hit rate. Because, it
appears that Dark Avenger went to all this trouble himself, maybe for
months.

  I must quote one thoughtful paragraph here:

  "Perhaps the appearance of the Mutation Engine should be considered a
  torture test for the R&D departments of all the anti-virus companies -
  if they are not able to detect it in a couple of months they would be
  well advised to redirect their efforts to other pursuits.

  Anti-virus programmers (and teams) are already stretched - the Mutation
  Engine may well be the straw that breaks quite a few camels' back.
  This is the technical editor's personal opinion .... "

                              The Mutation Engine - The Final Nail?

   Much truth in that; I agree.

>PS: The heuristics are only used if specifically requested, and will

  Once again, the word "heuristic" above did not mean the heuristic scan
  capability of F-PROT.

  Keep up the good work. When are we likely to see F-PROT 2.05?

P.S.: A revised copy of Mutation Engine Report that addresses certain
      ambiguities and that includes a more detailed section on mutation
      types and a sample decryptor analysis is available. It will not be
      posted here again since it is long (Ken already made an exception
      for us). It is included with CatchMtE, which will be uploaded to
      Simtel-20 archives in a few days.

Subject: Re: Weak (but not puny!) algorithms for checksumming (PC)

The safest form of checksumming is where:
  (a) It is unlikely two files will have the same checksum
      accidentally, and
  (b) virus writers get no significant advantage in aiming their
      attack at it.

The first requirement is fairly easily met by a long enough checksum,
and not using a simple summing technique. You might even get a system
where it would take hundreds of years on the fastest computer to
"crack" it - but that degree of safety might not be required.

The idea behind the second is that even if somebody goes to the effort
of producing a file with the same checksum, it doesn't help a lot in
making the virus (or whatever) survive better - either because the
checksum is only one of zillions that *might* have been used, or
because going to the effort of beating the checksumming makes the
virus more noticeable (larger, side-effects, other tests in the
system, etc).

As far as multiple checksums are concerned, I think the 3x3 example
was simply to show you can make a lot of methods from a bit of code,
rather than saying 9 is enough - imagine even 4x4x4 with a
randomly-chosen offset - you'd be lucky to guess the method by only
looking at a couple of files). But I still think high order
polynomials (with random choices in parameters) are most secure. It
all depends on the application, though...

If you want to check all the files on your computer to make sure they
haven't changed, you'll want speed, and selecting from lots of
different fast methods will be most appropriate; if you want to be
sure that some file (e.g. PKZIP210) obtained from a BBS is the genuine
article then you can put up with a one-off slow check, which is what
is required, of course.

For what it is worth, the system used in the BOOTID hashcodes is a
combination of methods, including a strange polynomial and checks for
certain things being present or not present. That means it isn't
possible to simply change some bytes here or there to make the
checksum come out right.  And the system is not meant to be a
*detection* system, so even if somebody manages to get a virus to have
the same hashcode as a good diskette it doesn't stop them from getting
spotted by whatever detector the user would have as well as BOOTID.
The parallel with a file integrity checker on your system would be
that even if some virus changes infected executables in such a way
they have the original checksum, you wouldn't *only* be looking for
changes in files - the virus would be *more* obvious to scanners (of
whatever type) and to users.  As everyone says, it is important to use
a combination of anti-virus measures, carefully chosen to "protect
each other's backs" - but preferrably not all from the same company,
to avoid directed attacks.

The problem I see is still for programs being distributed that may be
trojans or otherwise bogus.  Publishing several checksums (of several
types, including for the archive as a whole and individual files) is
one thing (and yes, using different types of checksumming is a Good
Thing), but what about the many people who see some nice looking
program on a BBS somewhere and down-load it without knowing where to
find the "official" checksums (if there are any)? I presume that PK's
authentication system was designed to meet that need - but it doesn't
very well.  That seems to be what deserves the most work, surely?

This is absolutly true if the only place that your are looking for viruses is
on your hard disk. In that case not only should one re-boot from a floppy
(which really can't support Windows execution without running files on the
hard disk), but one should consider using multiple products so as to reduce
the chance of missing an infection.

However, if you are confident that your system is currently virus-free, and
your main concern is the prevention of new infections, scanning an incoming
file or diskette under Windows is no less secure than scanning it after a
re-boot from a floppy. Having the ability to vet new code without major
inconvenience is important since it eliminates the temptation to skip the
check "just this once". Therefore a windows tolerant scanner makes sense as
a form of "incoming inspection". I agree that it should not be used for the
periodic verification that the system itself has remained clean.

Subject: Re: 696/Scr2/Enemy (was Re: Scream II virus help?) (PC)

Hello again,

Re-scanning the hard drive (C:) with Scan showed no viruses, but
F-Prot reported that 136 .EXE files were "invalid" and "suspicious."
Attempts to run some of these files resulted in crashes (hangs),
requiring Ctrl-Alt-Del or shutdown to reboot.

I discovered that other .EXE and .COM files not listed as invalid
also did not work.  In fact, none of the supposedly disinfected
files I tried would work, even though they had (as far as I know)
the correct file lengths.

So what I figure happened is:
1. I got an infected program or a trojan from somewhere
2. Eventually the infection spread to half of my .EXE and .COM files
3. I ran an infected scanner, thereby infecting the rest of my .EXE
   and .COM files.
4. I disinfected everything with Clean.  The files Clean reported as
   not safely-disinfectable were deleted.
5. I rescanned the disk with Clean and Scan separately, reporting no
   viruses.  I scanned with F-Prot and got no viruses but a bunch of
   "invalid" .EXE files.
6. A quick glance over my lists tells me that ALL of the .EXE files
   that were successfully disinfected (supposedly) by Clean are now
   "invalid," although their file lengths are okay.
7. None of my .COM files work either, so Clean apparently made them
   invalid in the disinfection process as well.
8. problems with the scanners: F-Prot doesn't detect invalid .COM
   files, doesn't have info on my virus, tells me I have a different
   virus.  Scan doesn't detect any invalid files, tells me I have
   Screaming Fist II (I have since been informed that 696 is a
   variant of Screaming Fist II), but Scr2 is not a valid disinfection
   code for Clean even though Scan says to use Scr2.  Clean removes
   696 from most files but leaves them invalid.
9. I should have stopped numbering at 5.
10. The worst part is, I bought my computer used, so the hard drives
    came packed full of things I can't easily replace!

Thanks again to all who have responded by mail.  This adventure isn't
over yet!  I've still got another drive to clean, and I would like
to help the F-Prot and McAfee people refine their software...
If they care to address the problems above (in #8)...
To those who asked for uuencoded infected files: I will first have to
re-obtain uuencode/uudecode for my PC since those were among the
once-disinfected, now-invalid .COM files.  I'll be doing that at the
same time I post this.  If anybody would like to take a look at a
couple of disinfected files that don't work, I can send COMMAND.COM
and PKZIP.EXE (1.02) as well.  Or is the problem not the data in the
files, but something in the disk itself?  If so, can it be repaired??

We have a system whereby all PCs are running Dr.Solomons memory-resident
checker, hence reducing the risk of any PC getting a virus, in order to
put it onto the network. Combine this with checking the network drives
every fortnight or so, and you have a reasonable protection routine.

We have had the system up for about ten months, and have had no
instances of virus infections at all, compared to an (almost) full time
job keeping PCs virus-free before :(

I do not know of any software that can check remotely over a network, so
think that this type of approach is the most likely to work. Unless, of
course, technology has improved beyond what I know.

All those viruses are related, co all three names are "right" in some
sense.  The question is whether to call Enemy a member of the
Screaming Fist family or call Screaming Fist a member of the Enemy
family.

I have not analysed this family in detail, but it is near the top of
my list of things to do, and as the virus is in the wild, I will
probably add a disinfector for it right away...

Don't assume such things. It is very unreliable to assume anything
about the virus name and properties, when it is reported by SCAN
(especially by version 91). The only thing that you can safely assume
is that you indeed have a virus.

More exactly, SCAN 91 reports as Scr-2 [Scr2] the following viruses:

	Screaming_Fist.II.B
	Stranger

My guess is that you have the first one, since it is known to be in
the wild in the USA.

If you indeed have the first one, then I cannot help you - I don't
know of any disinfector that removes it - it is just too new. I think
that F-Prot is able to disinfect the second one (it calls it Enemy),
but I am not sure. In any case, I advise you to try F-Prot - at least
you'll be able to see which of the two viruses you have (F-Prot calls
the first one "New or modified variant of Enemy").

Ah, just boot from a non-infected write-protected system diskette and
use a non-infected copy of the PKUNZIP program. This way the virus
will not be in memory and will not infect SCAN.

This clearly shows why the option to continue when a virus is found in
memory MUST NOT be given to the users, unless the anti-virus program
is able to deactivate the virus in memory (which SCAN isn't able to
do).

Doesn't seem like a known variant of Ping Pong - none of them moves
the ball in a regular rectangle... Besides, Ping Pong is a boot sector
infector, so you should check the whole drive, not the files. As far
as I know, SCAN should be able to detect all the known variants of
Ping Pong. I haven't tested version 91, though - testing the detection
of boot sector viruses is not that trivial...

Meanwhile I ran SCAN 91 on our virus collection, so I am able to
supply some additional information. SCAN 91 reports as 1530 [1530]
virus the following viruses (using the standard CARO naming scheme):

	Dark_Avenger.1530
	Dark_Avenger.Father
	Dark_Avenger.SlowDown
	Hymn.Hymn
	Hymn.Sverldlov
	Murphy.Brothers
	Rape.500
	Rape.747
	Rape_II.Germ

As you can see, you cannot rely on SCAN for virus identification. I
suggest you to try F-Prot - it is significantly better and
distinguishes between all the above viruses.

Hope the above helps.

Subject: Norton Commander virus? (PC)

The Norton Commander of our boss has a strange behaviour since he FTPed
some games 8c)...

ONLY the norton commander (3.0) is affected.

Every file copy made with the Norton Commander is "binary mutated" -
randomly some bytes change, and so the copy is of NO USE at all.
(the source-file is not changed, only the copied file).

DOS (5.0) copy and all other programms work correct.

After re-installing the Norton Commander from the original Installation
Disk it works for some time (5 minutes?) and then start making nonsense
again.

I SCANed the whole harddisk of my boss with several Anti-virus-prg.s -
all of them from Jun 92 - and these prg.s found nothing.

Can anybody reply by PRIVATE mail to me if he knows more about this
strange behavior of the Norton Commander?

Scorpio and Anti-Faggot are not viruses - they are "wannabe"s. They
don't work. No idea what No Rezid is. Several viruses claim to be
written by "Virusoft", including the Bulgarian MG viruses and the
Russian Hymn viruses, so I don't know which one you are speaking
about. Clipper is a Jerusalem variant, identified as Jeru-Clipper
by Dr. Solomon's Anti-Virus ToolKit, as Jerusalem (Clipper) by F-Prot,
and as VD [FD] by SCAN 91 [sic]. There is one virus called
Even_Beeper, identified as such be AVTK and F-Prot and not recognized
at all by SCAN. There is also a virus identified as Russian_Mirror by
AVTK and F-Prot, and as Beeper [Beep] by SCAN.

Hope the above helps.

Bill:

The things us guys down the hall do that you never knew about. ;)

The reason you've not seen a recurrence is because all of the
Bitnet "core" sites run a "selective file filter" that catches
any of the "known" variants of CHRISTMA EXEC - so even if there's
an outbreak, it stays "upstream" in one small section of Bitnet..

Files caught by the filter are dropped someplace for manual checking.

This might be a semantics debate.  A process tree where the user must
make yes or no determinations before proceeding to the next branch is
automated decision making, in a sense.

But getting away from semantics, a couple ideas that could be implemented:
1) a standard location on a network drive could provide information to the
integrity checker of updates conducted or available through the network.
This would only be for a network environment.  If a sysadmin propogates an
update through his network, the integrity checkers should be made to check
this directory and verify the new copy of software before calling attention
to it to the user.  2) You should be able to tell an integrity checker which
of your own directories are work areas and which directories contain your
utilities which should never change.  You know this.  And your integrity
checker can be made to know this.  But viruses wouldn't know this.
The implementation of this idea relies more on how it's presented to the
user (the wording) than any technical challenges.

Too quick to write a smiley perhaps?  If the system is already corrupted,
you'd be booted from DOS, not being able to get to OS/2.  And from DOS, of
course you can use The Norton Utilities.  Fixing it depends of course on how
badly it was corrupted.  But "it cannot be used" is obviously an incorrect
statement.  But if it was so obvious, why am I pointing it out?  :-)

You forgot the most important one - memory protection. The user
