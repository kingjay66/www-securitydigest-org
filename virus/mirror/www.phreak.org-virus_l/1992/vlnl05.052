Subject: New Virus TROI (PC)

Upon further study of the TROI virus I have found the following:

It is a .com infector only. The Troi virus hinders execution of some programs.
Virus code is located at the end of the original .com file and is jmp'd to
as a FAR procedure. The virus adds 322 bytes to infected .com's.
If you are using a virus scanner that allows entry of new virus signatures
the following HEX string will detect TROI: 2ac0cf9c80fcfc75

I have not found a virus program that can detect this virus so that is
why I considered it "new".

Thanks, Vesselin, but we recently became aware of this false positive.
It's fixed for the next release.  Real PITA, too! <grin>

Virex-PC and VIRx pop out after showing a single infection of a
file.  The only multiple infections we show would be viruses we
find in memory.

Dare I suggest you go with tools which were well designed instead of
well-advertised?  I would think that the VWATCH and VSAFE drivers
either a)do not encrypt their viruses or b)leave all sorts of stuff
around in memory -- potentially in DOS or FILE buffers.

This is more likely a timing problem between the keyboard controller

What happens is the KEY-RELEASE code for the shift gets lost, so the

Subject: disabling drive through CMOS (PC)

There have been several questions raised regarding the safety of running
a suspect program on a PC whose CMOS drive table has been changed to show
no hard disk installed.

I may be wrong--all my assembly language work was on mainframes--but changing
the CMOS does nothing to protect the hard disk.  All you do is remove a
table entry that legitimate programs, working through DOS, need.  A virus
can get to the drive directly so long as the controller and drive are
installed and have power.

The virus will not even need to try all possible CMOS combinations to hit
on the right one.  This information was essential for the original MFM
drives, but current drive types keep that information on the controller.  I
recently had to recover the CMOS settings for a PC with no documentation,
and found that whatever I put into the drive table worked perfectly.  I do
not know definitely which controllers work this way, but suspect that IDE
and SCSI both do.

The only really safe approach is to run the tests on a system with no hard
drive, or with an external hard drive that has been disconnected physically.

Trying F-PROT 2.02 on a Tandon 286 PAC, (the PACs are some kind of
removable Harddisks, 30 or 40 MB), I cannot check these PACs, instead
I'm geting the error message "error on harddisk", no matter when
"search = harddisk" or "search = user-defined (c:\ resp. d:\)" is

Does anyone know how this problem can be circumvented?

Hm, the McAfee people have to answer this... I don't keep the old
versions, so I cannot check, but I think that version 85 was the first
to detect the virus... The latest one is 86-B, so you should
definitively upgrade... And one last thing - SCAN cannot remove the
virus at all, since it is just a scanner; you must use CLEAN for virus
disinfections...

Are you sure that it is you -BIOS- (the one that is in the EPROM chips
of your computer), which asks you this? And not some kind of resident
program? If so, then it will warn you about the infection attempt.
Could you please tell us the exact brand of your computer? I have not
heard yet of any computer, the BIOS of which performs this... It is
really a nice thing to have around...

With only a one-byte change in the BIOS, it is possible to disable the
floppy boots forever, but I guess that this is not what you want. Some
laptop and notebook computers can be configured (by a CMOS RAM
setting) from which drive to try to boot first - first A: then C:, or
first C: and then A: (only if the boot from C: has been unsuccessful).
I would like to see more such computers in the future...

Padgett Peterson has a .COM file (<grin>), which does this. However,
this solves only the Alt-Ctrl-Del reboot problem. In fact, most users
get infected because the forget a floppy in drive A: when they turn
their machine on. And this can be solved only at the BIOS level; not
add-on program will do the job...

Two possibilities. Either get a better disinfector, or (preferred) get
a MS-DOS 5.0 system diskette (should be write protected). Go to every
computer, boot from that diskette, and run FDISK /MBR. Should remove
the virus without problems.

If there is no loss of security, why is there a "full check" option?

That doesn't seem mathematically possible. Could you please clarify?
No matter what method is used (hash or such) at some point the speed
will decrease (even if it is in the billions). Perhaps
"will not be decreased in the near future" is more appropriate?

Assuming the user knows that those changes are not "normal" (i.e.
a virus that infects during writes, etc).

It depends on the particular virus. The so-called stealth viruses,
when active in memory, will subvert any read request to the infected
objects (files, boot sectors, or directories), so that the latter will
seem to be non-infected. The so called fast infectors, when active in
memory, will infect any object being accessed (e.g., for scanning).
Therefore the scanning may just spread the infection to all your
files. Some viruses are both stealth and fast infectors (in fact, all
fully stealth viruses -must- be fast infectors, otherwise you could
disinfect the files by just copying them), so the net result of trying
to scan for such virus while it is active in memory is that you won't
be able to spot it and it will infect everything that is infectable.

Even worse, some viruses may trigger their destructive payload
routine, when a particular number of infections is reached. Therefore,
you must -always- boot from a non-infected write-protected system
diskette, any time you suspect a virus, and before any attempts to
detect or remove it.

> Or will the scanner still pick it up?

If the scanner is good enough, it should be able to detect the virus
in -memory-. If the -virus- is good enough (<grin>), then the scanner
won't be able to find it on the -disk-. However, not that the scanners
are able to detect only -known- viruses. If there is a new, stealth
fast infector active in your computer's memory, then the scanner won't
report anything at all and will just infect all your files (and maybe
even cause the destruction of some).

Ah, that's a tough question... The best answer is: you should obtain
your scanner from a reliable source. Actually, there is no way to
- -prove- that you don't have a virus. Are you certain that the original
DOS diskettes that come from IBM do not contain an unknown virus, put
intentionally there? :-) Or, are you certain that the compiler that
they used to produce the DOS wasn't infected? Or that the compiler
that was used to produce this compiler wasn't infected? All this with
the only purpose to infect your PC? :-) Well, while you can be almost
100 % certain that this is not the case, you can never actually
- -prove- it, unless you disassemble any single instruction yourself
(and do you trust your disassembler? Do you trust the microcode in
your CPU?). There is an excellent paper on this topic by Ken Tompson
(one of the guys who created Unix), called "Reflections ot Trusting
Trust" or something like that.

In fact, Jerusalem is much nastier than Michelangelo... Believe it
or not. It is more widespread, and it sometimes destroys the files
that you infect, although you have no way to determine that the files
has been destroyed, unless you run it and it crashes. This is much
worse, IMHO, than just overwriting your hard disk on one day of the
year...

The only silly question is the one that hasn't been asked... :-) Hope

This is enough to conclude that you had a false positive. Brain does

Point Software's Anti-Virus. :-) Tell him to stop doing so, until CPS

Yep. Just don't put them back... :-)

The reason is that all those products are using one and the same
signatures for all those viruses... However, CPAV is silly enough to
keep the signatures in memory unencrypted.

Well, you should, since as you have seen even computers without hard

Let me guess, did you recently upgrade to a higher DOS version? Or are

F-Prot is very very good and poverful, is free for individual usage,
and costs only $1 per machine per year for corporate use ($0.75 for
educational institutions). If you need something even better, you'll
have to pay more... :-)

>   3.What can be done with a HD with virus/es on it?To throw it away?

Of course not! That would be silly, wouldn't it? First, you have to
determine which particular virus it is. If it is a master boot sctor
infector, just booting from a MS-DOS 5.0 system diskette and executing
FDISK /MBR will remove the infection. If it is a boot sector infector,
booting from a non-infected system DOS disk (the same version that you
have on the hard disk) and performing SYS C: will get rid of the
virus. If it is a file infector, then removing the infected files and
replacing them with clean ones from your backups (you -do- have
backups, don't you?) will remove the virus. Sometimes it is even
possible to safely remove the virus from the infected objects. In the
worst case, you could low-level format your hard disk (almost always
unnecessary).

Correction. Since you are using VShield, you should not be worried
about any viruses that VShield IS ABLE TO DETECT PROPERLY. Not that it
will not stop a new (unknown to it) virus.

But wait, being infected (11 times!) by Jerusalem seems pretty strange
for me, especially for a person, who uses VShield... Wasn't VShield
able to detect that a file has been infected and refuse to execute it?

This is to McAfee to answer, but I suspect (don't believe me when I do
not -know- something for sure) that version 85 was the first to detect
Michelangelo.

VShield is a TSR, which scans files on-the-fly when you try to execute
them and refuses to run them if it considers them infected. It also
intercepts the Alt-Ctrl-Del and will refuse to reboot, if there is a
diskette, infected with a boot sector virus in drive A:.

Every file -and- the boot sectors, -and- memory.

The latest - no. One of them is since yesterday... :-) But hopefully
"the latest viruses" have not had enough time to reach you... :-)

Michelangelo cannot spread over a network. It is a boot/master boot
sector virus.

I don't know why exactly CLEAN fails (it seems to me that it does this
quite often with boot sector infectors), but F-Prot -must- be able to
correctly remove the virus. If it doesn't, then maybe you have a
modified variant.

Yes. It requires an attempt to boot from an infected diskette.

does any one know if the f-dlock that came with the old fprot is any
good?

I have seen, once, this error from Disinfectant 2.6. (System 7.0.0, on
a cx, 8MB RAM, virtual memory, 32-bits addressing ON, very few
extensions, Disk Doubler)

I ran the scan once and it bombed, ran it a second time (after
restarting) and it worked fine. No probrlems since. There were other
apps open the first time, and files were open that had been disk
doubled.

But I can forgive one crash, especially since it has never happend
again.

The only reason I mention it is because it was the same error.
(Unimplemented trap)

I have received a note from a user who said that MBDF A ran perfectly
happily on his vanilla SE running System 7.  Can someone with a copy
of the virus please check this out?  From all the documentation I have
seen about this virus, this should *not* occur.  If it occurs on an
SE, can it not occur on a Mac Plus as well?

A while back, some data was damaged on my Mac Plus, when I retrived
the damaged macwrite files, the word ACNE was splattered throughout
the document and it was no longer openable. Is there such a virus? or
is this just a coincidence??  Thanks (holding our breath until the
