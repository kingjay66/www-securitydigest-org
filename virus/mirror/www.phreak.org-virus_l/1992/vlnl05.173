With my usual modesty I hope that the code Mr. Nehl is referring to is
Stealth Bomber.  Stealth Bomber version 2.2 (formerly CRCSET) is
available in the following locations (among others):

risc.ua.edu (/pub/ibm-antivirus/stealth.zip) and
ux1.cso.uiuc.edu.

Stealth Bomber is a programmer's tool: it is an anti-virus protection
utility that uses a 32-bit CRC to test the integrity of the running
program and any supporting files.  It also performs a basic system check
for viruses that may evade detection by a file check.  Please note that it
will _NOT_ detect all such viruses (for every check, there is a way around
it).  Supporting code is in C and Turbo Pascal and full documentation is
included.

For the moment, it is not available under UNIX.  It is also not possible
to use the CRCSET.EXE generation program to patch UNIX files unless those
programs are to be run on an Intel architecture (or any other chip that
has low-byte to high-byte integer storage).

Subject: ExeBug - other names and removal? (PC)

There is an outbreak of EXEBUG virus on campus.

It is easily removed by copying the original partition table from
H0,T0,S17 to S17.

It is also easily detected by SCANv97 and Doc Solomon v5.  Both
identify it as ExeBug, and SCAN gives the clean code [Swb].  The
problem arises here - VIRLIST.TXT does not list ExeBug OR [Swb].
Neither does Hoffmans VSUM 9206.  What is the name used for this virus
in VIRLIST.TXT and VSUM?

Another question: the virus formats an extra sector on floppies and
     copies the original boot sector there - how does one read this
     sector?  Does the virus have to be in memory?  It can be cleaned
     by copying a clean boot sector from another floppy over it, but I
     would like to be able to copy the original boot sector.

Any help and information about ExeBug would be welcome.

Thanks in advance

For file infectors, over the past 6 months, we've only heard of one or
two cases where the number of infected files were in the couple of
hundreds.  Otherwise, it was always one's and two's.  (Otherwise
equals a few hundred cases that got through Tech Support to the "Lab."
Chances are, if the numbers were huge, Tech Support would have
involved us, and did.)

Boot infections is a different animal.  Here we hear about "hundreds"
of machines (can't tell if the person telling us is exagerating to
light a fire) quite frequently.  And we had one case of a couple
thousand machines infected by the same boot virus.

This is probably as good a place as any to advance my own "infection
rate" theory.  I would propose that a virus will spread only until it
meets an anti-virus system.  Thus, it would be one exponential
function chasing another, which would reduce to a linear effect.

(There was a recent article by Jeff Kephart of IBM also noting a
linear effect on virus spread.  If I recall correctly, his explanation
involved topology.  I think my explanation is easier to comprehend.
:-) "A virus spreads until it encounters an anti-virus system.")

That "I always warn people not to use" covers a lot of territory! In
the business world, that password feature is very desirable. It keeps
casual users out of systems and reduces the risk of virus infection
because the PC so protected won't boot from ANYTHING until the
password test is satisfied. Naturally, this "feature" is not helpful
in a user lab situation :-(

You do, however, point up a bigger problem - the sad lack of options
when one wants a BIOS version to match a particular set of
circumstances. I suspect that there is a market for this - picure
walking into a better grade of computer store. A PC in the order area
presents a menu driven system. You select your present (or just
ordered) motherboard, then choose from a list of BIOS options like:

password on boot
selective boot from a or b
separate keyboard lock code
shadow RAM options
etc
 
Seclect what you need, then the system programs a set of chips (a
matter of minutes from direct observation.) Given the amount of effort
devoted to virus creation, the amount of work required to do this
seems small.  Do I oversimplify?

The equipment required to program the chips is not that expensive, nor
is it difficult to use. The biggest problem I see is the database
required to match the BIOS type and chip type to the motherboard in
question.  Perhaps those with more direct knowledge would comment?

Sorry to niggle but must point out that the above refers to MS-DOS
(and its close family) only. More specifically to an Intel based
system (PC) in REAL mode. Once operating in PROTECTED mode or with
virtual DOS boxes, all bets are off. I point this out only so that
people running Windows do not do a memory-only SCAN from a DOS box and
possibly miss an infection in another. If you are going to run from
Windows, it is best to check the programs on disk as well.

With the rise of network authentication, this may become important 
in the future.

Just to quell another fear about swapped boxes, "stealth" won't work
when swapped out either.

Vesselin is correct that no known virus (though I'm not sure about that
new Windows specific one - haven't seen it) exploits this though I
am sure that it is just a matter of time.

While my esteemed colleagues (election is three days off) are both
essentially correct, I suspect that the whole thing is getting a bit
confusing to some of the readers ergo I shall attempt to elucidate
eschewing sesquipedalian phrasology.

FDISK/ is a dumb program. What it does is not related to the OS
version at all though an internal check keeps current versions from
running under anything except its own version and the /MBR switch
appears to be available only in the DOS 5.0 version hence to use it
you must boot with DOS 5.0. (My FixMBR could care less - plug).

As has been stated before the /MBR switch merely dumps a new code
segment into the hard disk using a BIOS interrupt while maintaining
the Partition Table. The code is rather simple, just sufficient to
find the OS boot sector (DBR), load it, and get out of the way. The
whole thing can be accomplished in a few bytes. (as an aside, the
original IBM PC-DOS MBR also had the author's name implanted - wonder
if IBM knew 8*)

Vess is correct that the OS on the Disk is unimportant except in a few
cases: for instance Mark William's COHERANT uses a "dual boot"
selected by a switch in the MBR code. Run FDISK/MBR on one of these
and the ability to boot with COHERANT will be lost.

The caveat here is that anything other than the P-Table is going to
get overwritten with "new" code. Unlike many Anti-Viral utilities, no
attempt is made to restore the original MBR contents.

Further, no attempt is made to validate the P-Table so if it is
corrupt, FDISK/MBR is not going to help (on the other hand, I have
seen some "smart" anti-virals happily restore what they thought
*should* have been the correct information and lose the real P-table
in the process. Caveat y'all).

So, the bottom line is that while you must boot with DOS 5.0 to use
the DOS 5.0 FDISK which contains the /MBR switch, the OS(s) on the
disk are irrevalent. As Aryeh says, if after booting the DOS
partitions are DIRable, FDISK/MBR will probably work. Just be aware
that this does not test for *other* partitions as the (also DOS 5.0)
UNFORMAT/PARTN/TEST/L command will.

The 1704.Format variant was somewhat common in the wild, but because of its
nature it probably managed to wipe itself out.  Most of the other variants
have also appeared in isolated cases, but are not nearly as common as the two
Vesselin mentioned.

As another contributor in the same digest pointed out, there is a
great deal of acrimony in the exchanges in this field. The most
charitable explanation is that we have a sizable number of very
talented people who, because of the nature of the field, must have a
paranoid view of every file that comes along. All of them are True
Believers protecting the innocents of the world both from the virus
authors and from the scum who would prey upon the victims.

From a technical standpoint, the detection ratio argument can be
summarized as:

1) If you cannot detect every single file infected by the MtE, you are
likely to leave one behind that can restart the whole cycle of
infection.  The product will give a false sense of security, and the
user will keep thinking that some outside source is causing
reinfection.

2) The most important factor in fighting viruses is to detect that you
are infected. Even if we don't detect every infected file, we at least
alert the user to the fact that he has a problem. In all likeleyhood
all of the infected files will be detected, so a slightly less than
100% detection ratio, while it needs correcting, is not a major flaw.

3) Because virus scanners got MtE detection (however flawed) in their
products very early, virus authors are not using the .91b version of
the MtE and so the threat of getting infected by it has been
countered. It is now a minor problem, and we can improve the algorithm
at a leisurly pace.

So, pick your favorite point of view, and cheer them on.

hello;

My mom recently purchased a IBM machine (PS/1) and is complaining
about her virus checker deleting her autoexec.bat file,(she has the
standard virus checking program that came with the computer) this only
occurs when she gets an error message that says something similar to
"can't read autoexec.bat and procedes to delete it.  This sounds to
me not like a virus problem, but a file problem.

So my question is does anyone know anything about this problem and if
i told her right? (the program also deletes a text file from where the
search program is located on her hard drive, so I am at a loss on
this.  I know some programs delets file upon use (like workperfect and
others) but never have I heard of this happening.)

The FDISK/MBF will NOT work right on drives that are partitioned by
DiskManager program. If you have a DOS/DM drive and you boot from a
clean floppy to use FDISK/MBR, your DM partition is lost.  The DM
partition, for that matter, is any NON-DOS partition.

MtE stands for mutation Engine. What is does is hide the virus by
mutating it using a random number generator. This makes the virus VERY
hard to detect. MtE can be linked to any virus and is available as a
Module (like a libary for C for example). It's a very nasty pieces of

off some of these viruses and made a tricky work on them.

Do you know LZEXE ?

It's a worldwide spread package like PkLite, that is it compresses
executable files.

In the complete package there is a program called COMTOEXE.

LZEXE only works with .EXE files, so if you want to compress a .COM
file with LZEXE you have to convert it from .COM to .EXE.

The conversion is very simple, in fact COMTOEXE adds 32 bytes long
header at the top of the file, and the CS:IP points to the first byte
after the header.

Well, I converted the files from COM to EXE, and made some scanning
tests with the mentioned programs.

The results were a bit strange, in fact:

    F-prot 2.05
    Scan 97
    VirX 2.4

missed *ALL* the converted files, while

    Gobbler 2.99 beta 5
    TbScan 4.3

got each infected file.

The viruses in the files missed by F-prot, Scan and VirX in the .EXE
form were all found out by the same programs in the original .COM
version.

I have personally tried to infect a COM file starting from a .EXE

G'Day Folks

Recently, I have had a run-in with the so-called ExeBug virus.  I have
some information on it from BIT magazine, and was interested to find
out some more about it in VIRLIST.TXT v97 (from McAfee) and VSUM 9206
(Hoffman).  However, neither sources listed this virus at all.  Doc
Solomon v5 did list this virus, it could also detect and apparently
remove it too (from the partition table, while files had to be
deleted).  When I used SCANv97 it detected the virus as ExeBug [Swb],
in a 1.2 boot sector.  I used CLEAN 97 A: [Swb] /nomem to remove the
virus, and CLEAN reported that it had removed the virus.  However, on
rebooting (before any other programs were run), the partition table of
the HDD was infected! (Yes, the virus was removed beforehand, by
copying Sector 17 to Sector 1.  Also, [Swb] was not listed in
VIRLIST.TXT.

In the article by BIT magazine, it was stated that the virus formatted
an extra sector for itself, and copied the original boot sector there.
I couldn't find this extra sector with Norton 6.01's DISKEDIT, so
copied clean boot sectors from other disks to the infected disks.

My 1st question is: What is the actual name used by VIRLIST.TXT and
VSUM for ExeBug?

Secondly: How does one read this extra sector formatted on floppy
disks?

Thanks in advance

Dave

They do; I don't ;-) : it's "its"! (my typo: an apostrophe catastrophe).

I'm not either (I get enough abuse being a programmer).

Meanwhile, software publishers are *rushing* to remove the offending
clause(s) from those envelopes in which commercial software is
shipped. You know: the ones with the contract you accept by opening
the envelope? Right. First thing next Tuesday. Is Bill Gates (or the
Dark Avenger, for that matter) losing any sleep over this?

CATCHM15.ZIP    Algorithmic MtE virus scanner and MtE report

CatchMtE is designed to recognize viral code based on the so-called
Mutation Engine distributed by DarkAvenger from Bulgaria.  CatchMtE
uses sophisticated algorithms to determine if a program is infected by
an MtE-based virus.

We have tested it on MS/PC DOS 3.3+ as well as Netware 386 based
disks.  On network drives, some files may not be opened and will
generate an error message.  The program uses handle-oriented DOS file
access for compatibility.

                     Scores virus - functions
 
The Scores virus has a complicated structure and operation.  There
are time delays, and the use of both the system and application
files for reproduction.
 
It starts simply enough.  When an infected application is run on a
new system, the system folder is infected.  Two invisible folders
are created, one named Desktop and the other Scores (hence the
name).  Thus the Scores infection gets to start early and go
"resident".  (INITs of 6, 10 and 17 are created.  This led to later
problems with other INITs numbered the same way that were mistakenly
thought to be infected.)
 
The Note Pad and Scrapbook files, if not already present, are
created.  The file types for these files are changed, as are the
normal icons.
 
The virus waits two days before it starts to infect applications. 
Thus the Scores might almost seem to be an early form of the
multipartite virus, since it "toggles" between system and
application files.  However, it is only after the infection has
entered the system folder that the other activities take place.
 
Four days after the infection of the system folder, the second part
of the virus starts up.  At this point, it looks for applications
which, when run, identify themselves as ERIC or VULT.  If such an
application is run, the application will be terminated after 25
minutes of operation.
 
Seven days after the infection of the system folder the final part
of the payload comes into play.  Again operating on applications
with the VULT resource, it will force errors and termination on a
complicated series of timings and operations.
 
The timing sequences and complicated arrangements for triggering of
errors and program termination would seem to indicate that the
author saw this program interfering with an application in a normal
environment, and generating "normal" problems.  An intermittent
"bug" would be difficult to trace, and would be less likely to be
effectively attended to as a virus.  This would tend to support the
idea that the author thought to cause trouble for ERIC and VULT as a
released application.  It does not, however, rule out the
possibility of creating trouble for an in-house utility.
