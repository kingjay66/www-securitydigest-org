Well, that is the problem with heuristic analysis - it generates
occasional false alarms.  This particular message simply means that at
least three "virus-like" features are found within the program.  The
reason I don't tell exactly what features is simple - I don't want to
make it too simple for virus authors to hide their viruses from my
program, by telling them exactly what I detected.

In this case the most significant feature is that it opens the file
when it is to be executed, as you expected, but it finds some other
minor features as well....I guess I have to make some minor changes to
my database of rules but please keep in mind that this program is
attempting a theoretically impossible task - differentianting between
viruses and non-viruses, so a few false positives and false negatives
are unavoidable.

Subject: exact damage of Michelangelo on 3-06 (PC)

Could someone tell us what the exact damage would be on the ominous 6
March when the Michelangelo virus awakes? The rumours vary on this
subject. Does it only affects e.g. the partition table, does it
destroy the FAT (in/excluding its copy), or does it really perform a
low level format of the hard disk.

We haven't discovered the Michelangelo virus at our university yet, so
we can't try it ourselve.

Thank you all in advance.

Subject: Preventing virus infection by disabling the hard disk (PC)

Before testing new software on my 286/386 machines, I disable the hard
disk by changing the CMOS hard disk type to 0 and reboot from a
write-protected floppy disk.  I proceed to evaluate the new software
on floppy disk and monitor for any suspicious activity.

It seems that DOS and most programs cannot access the hard disk from
this point.  However, are there any viruses (actual or theoretical)
that can infect the hard disk after the CMOS disabled it?

It this method sufficiently safe or is it necessary to disable the
hard disk by physically disconnecting the cables?

Subject: AUX, Mirror, etc (PC)

Ok, I grabbed our old copy of Norton Utilities 4.5 and checked two
machines. One was DOS 3.31, the other 5.00. On both FF didn't find
anything for "FF C:AUX*.*". But it did find a 112 byte AUX file (with
the current date/time!) in every directory for "FF C:AUX".

My gues is that Kathy tried to create a file called AUX, and was
(correctly) told that it already existed. Then she did an FF AUX. The
results we know...

As for the person looking for a "Mirror" virus, Central Point's MIRROR
program creates a huge hidden file named MIRORSAV.FIL. This is to enable
recovery after an inadvertent format of the drive. I believe that this may
also be used by DOS 5.0

Just to add another one.
I tried to find these miraculos files. I managed it by using Windows 3.0 File-
manager. All I did was: Alt File, Find, and then I used "AUX:" as filename.
The window showing the found files got filled with 1 file in each (sub)director
y
By the way: I use MS-DOS 5.0 and the german version of windows. The problem why
some of you did not find the AUX-files might be, that they forgot about the
colon.

I heard a scare item on an Irish radio station this morning about a
virus called "Forms", which, according to the annoucer will trash PC
system files on the 23rd of the month.

Does anyone know anything about this virus, particularly how to
detect/remove it? It's a matter of urgency if it's true about the 23rd
of the month.

On a more general note (and I apologise if it is too general, I
couldn't find a FAQ file in this group), can anyone advise me on
procedures for regularly scanning a PC for viruses? This is something
I have not done up to now and I think I should start. I noticed a
program VIRX mentioned in this newsgroup - is it good? Should it be
used in conjunction with other programs and if so which ones, and
where can I get them?

Any help with the above questions would be greatly appreciated.

I have some curiosity questions about the way "boot sector" viruses
infect the "hard drive" and "the system (memory)", (or is it "the
system (memory)" and then the "hard drive"?), only because I have been
reading the Digest for awhile and do not recall this being addressed.

I understand how the floppy does not need to be "bootable" because the
virus can exist on the floppy in the area where the computer "looks"
first when attempting to "boot" from any floppy in drive "A".

First example:

We, (you, me, anybody), have a "powered-off", non-infected, MS DOS
based, PC computer system with one 5.25" floppy drive and one hard
drive.  Let's say I have an infected (Michaelangelo virus) 5.25", 360K,
"bootable" floppy.  Let's put it into our "A" Drive and close the
door.  Now, turn on the power to the computer and let it "boot" up.  We
now have a DOS Prompt.

1.  Is the virus in memory?  I believe yes.

2.  Has the virus infected the hard drive?   In most systems, yes.

Second example:

We have the same "powered-off", non-infected, MS DOS based, PC computer
system with one 5.25" floppy drive and one hard drive.  Let's say I
have an infected (Michaelangelo virus) 5.25", 360K, "NON-bootable"
floppy.  Let's put it into our "A" Drive and close the door.  Now, turn
on the power to the computer and let it attempt to "boot" up.  Instead
of a DOS Prompt, we now have "Non-system disk or disk error; replace
and strike any key when ready" or something like that--you get the
idea.  NOW, instead of replacing and rebooting, let's turn the power
off.

1.  Is the virus in memory?  I believe no, since the power is off.

2.  Has the virus infected the hard drive?  (I do not know.  Can
                                              someone answer for me?)


The point I am getting at is this:  Most people will FIX the "non-boot"
problem by opening the floppy drive door and then use the three-key
(CTRL-ALT-DEL) combination to "reboot" from the hard drive without
turning the system power off, possibly leaving the virus in memory, but
maybe the virus has not infected the hard drive yet, giving it the
opportunity to now infect the hard drive, after the second, now
successful, "boot" attempt.

If we were to turn the system power off, killing the virus in memory,
and then reboot from a "non-infected" floppy disk, would the hard drive
already be infected?

Please let me know if this makes sense and/or is understandable as
written?  Thank you for any input and for taking the time to think this
out.   ---Randy

This sounds like a hardware problem instead of a "virus" problem.  I
had a similar problem some time back and found out that the floppy
disk drive on an AT system the diskette changeline signal is used to
determine whether the disk has been changed. The DC signal has a value
of 1 unless a disk is present in the drive and a ste pulse has been
received by the drive to move heads, in which case the signal is set
to 0.  When you move the door lever on a high-capacity drive, the DC
signal is reset to 1.  After the disk has been accessed and until the
door is opened again, the signal is set to 0.  The drive initially
reads the contents of the disk into memory and unless the signal is
changed (by inserting another disk into the drive), the directory will
be read from memory.  This speeds up the accessing of the disk
contents by avoiding a read to the disk every time.  This problem can
be caused by an incorrectly configured drive, as well as by a drive
where the door switch mechanism no longer operates correctly.  A
temporary solution to the problem is to remember to press the
Ctrl-Break or Ctrl-C combination every time you change floppy disk in
the drive.  These commands cause DOS to flush the RAM buffers and
reread the directory and file allocation table on the next disk
access.  Hope this helps.

I have seen a case where a 1.2M diskette was rendered unreadable by
the virus on a specific older PC.  I actually saw this happen.  When I
brought the unreadable diskette to a newer-model PC, the disk was read
with no problem.  I tried to read this diskette on a variety of PC's,
and the older model PCs sometimes had trouble reading it, whereas the
newer models didn't.  The real strange thing was that >sometimes< the
drive would read the disk, and >sometimes< it wouldn't.  The disk
was readable by that drive prior to infection, according to the
user.  The message received was a General Failure error.

To this point, NCSA has provided no viruses to Intel.  The intel
product was, however, reviewed by NCSA.  The product was tested
against the full NCSA library.
As for virus access, the NCSA complies with the wishes of the Anti-Virus
Product Developer's Consortium in order to help determine who will gain
access.  Basic requirements are to demonstrate a true "need" for
viruses as well as agreeing to the code of ethics and non-proliferation.
These, of course, are in addition to showing that a prospective group
has (or is in development of) an anti-virus product.
As was the case with Intel, NCSA does perform independent evaluations
of anti-virus products (as well as other security products).  By
this means, developers improve their products and are better able
to combat the global virus problem.

The tests were done, as was stated, on a Netware 3.11 network with a
compaq systempro (2 486-33's) containing a hard disk with 4868 files
in 148 directories.  All of these files tested seem to contain a virus
of one sort of another.  Without question, there are duplicates, but
we now recognize over 1,000 completely different samples.  The setup
with directories was designed to approximate that of a real "live"
site.  The full report is available from the NCSA office at
717-258-1816 or from the NCSA research center at 202-364-8252.  It

The best way to do a "clean" format is to boot the machine from an
un-infected R/O floppy and then format the disk.  This way You are
sure no virus is in memory.  Don't forget that on DOS 5 you need the
/u switch to do an unconditional format so that "all" existing info on
disk is gone (not possible to do unformat, so therefore not possible
for virus to reappear).  -Don

Well, in terms of boot-sector infectors, I don't think that there is
any possibility, but since I don't know enough about Novell, I won't
rule out the possibility completely.  I'll post to comp.sys.novell and
let you guys know more about this.

There is a possibility of infection if you use the remote-boot roms,
however.  This would involve the infection of the "original" disks
from which you generated the boot image files.  (Yes, I do believe
that Novell creates an exact sector-for-sector image of the floppy)
I am not sure if virus checkers would scan the boot-image file and
detect a virus correctly.  I'll have to look into this...

In terms of file-infectors, it is impossible to infect a file unless
you have write access to the file.  This is because the server performs
all write/read/accdess right checks, not the workstation.  However, if
the virus is written specifically for Novell, they might know about
some holes in Novell.  Also, you could set the files to Execute-only,
in which case NOBODY has write access to the file.  Of course, this
will not work for all programs, such as those which use overlays
(according to Novell documentation.  I haven't had to deal with such a
program yet).

(Just fyi, I have been working with Novell for the past 5 years now)
