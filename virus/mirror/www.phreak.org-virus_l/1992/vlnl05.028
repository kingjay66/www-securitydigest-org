According to the University's telephone center, the VTC Hamburg
received 3,000 phone calls for the last week. This happened after we
told the media about the virus... :-)

Booting (or attempt to boot) from an infected floppy (not hard disk)
gives a 1-in-8 chance to see the message.

Subject: Maltese Amoeba? (PC)

A friend approached me the other day to ask if I new anything about
the virus Maltese Amoeba. Not being a virus expert (or one who has
ever had to consider such things, our Centre deals with it) I could
not answer. However, on asking `our man' he could not help either, so
I turn to you... I am also not a regular reader of this group so
please cc. any replies to me.

The only details she had were:

1) It is believed to have originated in Malta (hence the name!)
and been passed to their system.

2) It was detected when the disk space was used by an unknown source,
and no other programs could be run. There has been no further
disaster with it but they are obviously concerned.

3) It was detected just after Christmas but they have only ever heard of
one other occurrence of it.

I have scanned the current postings for any details on it but the
only reference I've seen is a query like mine and that perhaps its
alias is Irish Virus.

So if you can help, all suggestions would be appreciated.
Thanks in advance,

Reference the AUX file in every directory.  Check the date each file
was created.  It may simply be a reflection of the way the software
was installed on the HD.  If each software package was installed as if
it was the only software on the drive then a separate AUX file might
result.

Ok, my IBM 286 is acting strange, I am running drdos 5.0, and when I
type "mem" or "chkcsk" with no TSR's in memory, I get:

639k = conventional memory
571k = largest available block

WHY???  No programs are in memory, and I didn't even run a config.sys,
so nothing should be in the memory...right??? especially something
that large!

ok, the "problem" with the lost 1K block could easily be stemming from
you r Cmos or Xcmos setup, there is an option there that set something
(I can't remebr right now) so that it can either take up 1K of regular

I haven't analyzed it either, but we had it hit a series of machines
in the offices where I work.  It was provided (free of charge) by a
clone systems manufacturer along with some public domain/shareware
stuff (and also the Jerusalem virus).  The apparent symptoms are that
an infected executeable will not run (giving a 'cannot execute' error
or something to that effect) the first time an attempt is made, and
will be deleted either at that time or the next time an attempt is
made to run it.  It is reported by some virus detection software as
the 1193 virus (due to it's size) but is now more commonly known as
the Copyright virus (I don't know why).  It is reported to infect .COM
files (including COMMAND.COM, load itself into RAM and remain
resident, and directly or indirectly corrupts file linkages.  More
info (and removal procedures) can be had from McAfee Associates anti-
virus products.

To:  >INTERNET:VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU

In the Virus-L digest, vol. 4, Issue 180, of 3 Oct 1991, Bontchev gives an
xx-encoded TSR, IMV.COM, which prevents execution or copying of a file
which has been infected by the DIR II virus.  F-PROT ver 2.02 gives the
following message when this file is scanned using the heuristic scanning
option:

"This program contains several features which are normally only found in
virus programs.  It is almost certainly virus infected."

I disassembled IMV.COM and it is most certainly not virus-infected.  What
triggers the alarm?  The way it opens a file for read access, when the
calling program expects the file will be executed?  Or the way it checks
whether it is already installed in memory by calling INT 21 with AX=A5C1
and checking if AX=C1A5 is returned? Or what?

In fact the two viruses have several good search strings in common,
since Michelangelo is derived from stoned.  But I strongly discourage
the kind of protection you are relying on: it gives a false sense of
security.  The data-diddling variant of Empire, for instance, could be
happily installed on your computer without you noticing. It would be
undetected, except when it came time to restore your system from backup
diskettes: then you would discover that your backups aren't right.
If I give you a search string for it too, then what about Joshi?  Or
Bloody!?  Or the Form virus?  All of these have appeared here at U of
Alberta, so they are probably common at Toronto as well.

I know it is gratifying to use a program one has written oneself, but
in this case I don't think it is the wisest choice.  Others have worked
on this problem full time for a long time, and their tools are much
more effective.

My strong recommendation is:
1. Use Padgett Peterson's FIXUTILS to install a "safembr".  Then you are
protected from (virtually?) all MBR infectors, not just stoned and mich.
It will not use any more memory, will not require anything in your
autoexec.bat or config.sys.  It simply turns the MBR into what Microsoft
should have made it be in the first place.

2. Use the VIRSTOP driver from FPROT, or some similar product, in your
config.sys or autoexec.bat file.  Such products provide much better
protection against all known (and some unknown) viruses.

There are other products as well: the thing I like about the above two
is that they work very well, and the prices are right.

Tim.

Unfortunately it is true - he has distributed a "mutation engine",
which can be incorporated into viruses - which makes them undetectable
by a signature- based approach.  Instead an algorithmic approach has
to be used, which takes a lot longer to develop than simply finding a
new search string.

In response to tong@ee.ubc.ca (Issue # 19 ) :

during 3 subsequent infections of Michelangelo and Stoned the
following is possible :

Locations :  (Side/Track/Sector)

             0/0/1              1/0/3                  1/0/14

          (bootsector)   (here Stoned stores          ( here Michelangelo
                          the original                  stores the original
                          bootsector )                  bootsector on
                                                         HD-floppys )

1)        Original Bootsct      nul                    nul

2) ( 1st Infection )

          Michelangelo          nul                    Original Bootsct

3) ( 2nd one)

          Stoned         Michelangelo                  Original Bootsct

4) ( 3rd one)
          Michelangelo     Michelangelo                Stoned


    --> Voila, the original boot sector disappeared |||

Now the cleaning process :

1) ( Michelangelo found, cleaned )

        Stoned           Michelangelo             nul

2) ( Stoned found , cleaned )

        Michelangelo     nul                      nul

3) ( Michelangelo found, not removable, cause no original bootsector found)

    Now the floppy should also not be bootable any more .

Subject: clean up v85 destroys floppy (PC)

 In Dec 91' one dumb IBM-AT ( 8 MHz :(  )  got infected with
 the Michelangelo Virus, also about 10 HD 5,25" floppies I used there.

 After unvoluntarly booting from such a floppy , my harddisk at home
 also got it. But as a suspicious PC-maniac , I immediatley performed a cold
 boot ( from the HD :( ), scanned and found the Virus active, coldbooted
 from a system floppy, looked for the MBR using Norton Utilities, replaced
 the Virus with it.

 Then  I disassembled the little beast, and tried to disinfect the floppies
 with cleanup v 85.
 But the 'powerful' disinfector only erased the Bootsector completely ( all
 00's ) and left the original boot program where the Virus copied it to,
 at the end of the root directory.

 Due to a slight wonder ( for me) explained by Frisk or Vesselin a while ago
 the floppy is still usable ( cause the Media Descriptor Byte in the bootsct
 is only read under certain conditions which I don't remember ) , but
 I Wonder what happens if I try to boot using this disk ( I expect a message
 from the ROM-BIOS , cause even the 'No bootable disk' message isn't there).

From:    terry@lawton.lonestar.org
Subject: Info on Atari ST and Mac viruses (Mac) (Atari ST)

I have two virus reports to file and one question to ask.  The first
virus was d etected, January 1992, on an Atari 1040STe 4 meg system
using ST Virus Killer Ve rsion 3.84, April 1991 by George Woodside.
The source of the virus was a local  Atari Microcomputer user group
member in Lawton, Oklahoma.  The member acquired  the infection in
Oklahoma City in November 1991.

The virus was identified by the program as "The 'Mouse Inversion' or
'Ghost' Vir us:  This virus does not check boot sectors to determine if
they are already exe cutable.  It hooks itself into the ST operating
system and writes a copy of itse lf onto every disk the ST reads or
writes.  It will overwrite any boot sector, r endering other booting
disks useless.

The virus acts by counting how many copies of itself it has written.
After five copies are made, it starts attacking.  Every five times the
boot sector of eith er floppy disk is accessed, the virus reverses the
vertical orientation of the m ouse.  ST Virus Killer was able to clean
up the effected disk and the virus appa rently has not spread on my
system.  The second virus encountered was in the Mac emulation mode on
the Atari 1040STe.

The virus was detected using Disinfectant 1.1 written in MPW C by
John Norstad .  The virus was detected in 32 files and folders on the
Mac partition of the At ari hard drive.  The source of the infection
was the University of Oklahoma.  I  assume it entered the program
collection on a disk that had been used in the OU  Library computer
center.

The virus detected was a strain of nVIR identified by the program as
nVIR A.  nVIR infects the System file and then spreads to other
applications immediately.   It does not use the 2-3 day delay of scores
and infects each new application run without the 2-3 minute delay.

At first nVIR A only replicates.  When the System file is first
infected, a coun ter is initialized to 1000.  The counter is
decremented by one each time the sys tem is started up and it is
decremented by two each time an infected application is run.

When the counter reaches zero, nVIR A will sometimes say either
"don't panic" (i f MacinTalk is installed in the system folder) or beep
(if MacinTalk is not inst alled in the system folder).  This will
happen on system startup with a probabil ity of 1/16.  It will also
happen, with a probability of 15/128, when an infecte d application is
run.  In addition, when an infected application is run, nVIR A  may say
"don't panic" twice or beep twice with probability of 1/256.

Detection of nVIR A can only be done with a program like Disinfectant
1.1.  There is no way to tell if you have been infected by just looking
at the system.  Disinfectant 1.1 successfully identified and removed
nVIR A (at least that is what  its report said).  I noticed that
certain applications, that had self-reported as corrupted upon
startup, ceased to report the corrupted condition after disinfecting
the system.

I have one other item to report which leaves a question.
Infrequently I encounter a disk that has been damaged while in drive A
on the Atari system.  This last occurred during the download of
scan85.zip, clean85.zip and vshld85.zip.  Floppy disks are only damaged
when the write-protect is off and they remain in the system for more
than several minutes.  Since I operate off of a hard drive the majority
of the time it has not been a dramatic issue.  However, the possibility
of a virus on the hard drive effecting the floppy drive operation is a
possibility.  Could it be that the damage is the result of a virus on
the hard drive of the Atari 1040STe?  Comments on this issue will be
greatly appreciated.
