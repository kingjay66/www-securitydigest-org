Hi Earle,

You really don't have enough information yet to determine whether or
not you have any new virus. I can think of any number of reasons why
your young mate's (I'm an Oz too) machine should play up the way it
is, ranging from slippery fingers to incompatible Dos's.

Your best shot at this stage is to use a more up-to-date scanner to
look at it. If you are determined to resolve the problem, you should
also use a checksummer to see if any executables are changing.

Just monitor the situation and see if you get any more activity.

	I remember having read a file in the FP-205.ZIP packet which
explains that the author hasn't corrected this problem yet and doesn't
intend to do so in the near future.  I guess I'm not mistaken, but I
don't have this file with me at present in order to confirm this.

	If you run F-PROT from drive a: you can't scan diskettes in
the same drive because F-PROT needs to access itself.

	Despite this, I consider F-PROT to be the best antivirus
program ever written.  The rate at which its updates appear is
amazing!  I always upload its newest version to several Brazilian BBSs
and it seems to be taking the place McAfee's programs held here..
Congratulations to Frisk!

Yes, but assuming the files can be checked without the possibility of
a virus already in memory, to return the wrong file information, or
(possibly) that the change detector does such a good job of bypassing
DOS and BIOS that it cannot be fooled.

> How would one apply this technique to some programs that modify their

Basically the answer is to divide the files into sections, and have
separate checks for each section, and perhaps "know" the nature of the
changes that are allowed.  Quite often, the start of the file (be it
.EXE or .COM) doesn't get changed by self-modifying programs, but does
by viruses. There is another method, which I am still experimenting
with, that is relatively insensitive to typical self-modification
effects (and mutations of viruses), but is computationally intensive.

> Does the MS-Windows distribution contain any such binary files that

I don't know, but probably! The version munging option in MSDOS 5
supposedly used some self-modification. The number of programs that
modify themselves (or other programs!) is relatively small (but still
annoying), so can be handled as exceptions.

Subject: New virus that scanv95b cannot pick it up!!!(HELP) (PC)

I just found out that my computer is attacked by a new virus(may be).
The signatures of that virus is always attack the "format.com" file.
When I viewed the file, the file contain "-stack!--stack!--stack!--"
string.  And this string has about 10 or more "-stack!-" in it.

In my friends' cases, it attacked the borlandc directory(Borland C++
3.0).  The directory /borlandc/opernach (spelling?) has lots of junks,
also with the word "-stack!-" and cannot be deleted.  Also the virus
rewrite the file "config.sys" with a long string of repeated
"-stack!-".

It seems that the virus will trigger by different kind of software and do
different things.

Does anyone has any clue about this?

If anyone has any information about this virus (how to delete the virus etc.)
Please email me as soon as possible.

Thanks for helping!!

Subject: MBDF Authors Plead (Mac)

Three former Cornell students, who had been facing a total of forty
computer tampering and related charges in connection with the creation
and release of the MBDF virus affecting Macintosh computers this
February, struck a plea-bargain agreement here in Ithaca yesterday.

David Blumenthal and Mark Pilgrim, each of whom had been facing felony
first degree computer tampering charges, pleaded guilty to one count
each of second degree computer tampering, a misdemeanor.  Randall
Swanson pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of disorderly conduct.
Swanson was not originally implicated in the case when the virus was
traced to Blumenthal and Pilgrim, but was charged this summer.

None of the three are currently enrolled for the fall semester at
Cornell University.  While the University is prohibited by federal law
from revealing the outcome of disciplinary action against students,
unofficial word has it that some of the students have been expelled
from the University, and the other(s) suspended for at least one year.
A 27 August memorandum from William Streett, the Dean of Cornell's
College of Engineering, referred to an unnamed group of students who
had been charged with violating Cornell's Code of Academic Integrity
"as a result of improper and unauthorized use of computers and network
systems."  Streett said that the punishments in these cases "include
expulsion and suspension for a year or more."  The memo went on to
remind students of their responsibility in maintaining academic
integrity standards in their computer use, and suggested that students
with special talents in computing and network systems "put these to
constructive use by tutoring other students or through volunteer work
with one of the local social service agencies."

Subject: Beta testers needed for new security tool (UNIX)

Announcing the pending availability of

	       Tripwire: A Unix File Integrity Checker

    This message is being posted to various newsgroups and mailing
lists to gather a group of beta-testers for a new security tool called
Tripwire.  Tripwire was written by Gene Kim, currently at Purdue
University, under the direction of Professor Gene Spafford.

    Tripwire should be of significant interest to system
administrators concerned about timely detection of system file
tampering on their Unix hosts.


Goal of Tripwire:
=================

    With the advent of increasingly sophisticated and subtle
account break-ins on Unix systems, the need for tools to aid the
detection of unauthorized modification of files becomes clear.
Tripwire is a tool that aids system administrators and users in
monitoring a designated set of files for any changes.  Used with
system files on a regular basis, Tripwire can notify system
administrators of corrupted or tampered files, so damage control
measures can be taken in a timely manner.

    Tripwire is a system file integrity checker, a utility that
compares a designated set of files and directories against
information stored in a previously generated database.  Any
differences are flagged and logged, and optionally, a user is
notified through mail.  When run against system files on a
regular basis, changes in critical system files would be spotted
at the next time-interval when Tripwire is run, so damage
control measures may be implemented immediately.  With
Tripwire, system administrators can conclude with a high degree
of certainty that a given set of files remain untouched from
unauthorized modifications, provided the program and database are
appropriately protected (e.g., stored on read-only disk).

    Tripwire uses message digest algorithms (cryptographic
checksums) to detect changes in a hard-to-spoof manner.  This
should be able to detect significant changes to critical files,
including those caused by insertion of backdoors or viruses.  It
also monitors changes to file permissions, modification times,
and other significant changes to inodes as selected by the system
administrator on a per-file/directory basis.

What we need:
=============

    As of this writing, Tripwire runs successfully on both BSD
and System V variants of Unix.  Among the operating systems
Tripwire has run on are:

		SunOS 5.x (SVR4)
		SunOS 4.x (BSD 4.3)
		Dynix 3.x (BSD 4.2)

    Compiling Tripwire should be as simple as editing the config.h
file to set the appropriate #defines, and typing 'make'.

    A pool of beta-testers is needed to ensure that Tripwire
works predictably on a wide variety of systems.  Of particular
interest are system administrators using the following operating
systems:

		AIX
		AUX
		BSD4.4
		HP/UX
		Mach
		NextOS
		OSF/1
		SVR3.x
		Ultrix
		Unicos
		Xenix
		System III
		Versions 6, 7, 8, & 9  :-)
		other versions we didn't list

    A config.h file allows you to tailor Tripwire around your
system specifics, such as the locations of system utilities (like
sort and diff), and desired lookup pathnames to your Tripwire
database files.

    Possible porting trouble-spots are generally restricted to
dirent(S5)/direct(BSD) funkiness and #defines that changed for
POSIX compliance (such as those in <sys/types.h> for stat.st_mode).

    Hopefully the process of beta-testing will highlight any
problems before any widely-released distribution.  It is also
hoped that reasonable system defaults for a wide variety of
systems can be gathered from a diverse set of beta-testers.
This would allow useful plug-and-play builds for the majority of
Tripwire users.


What you'd get as a beta-tester:
================================

    The entire source to Tripwire, manual pages, a README, and
the Tripwire design document.


What you'd need to do:
======================

    You will need to install the code on your system and run
it.  You will need to report back any bugfixes, enhancements,
optimizations or other code-diddling that you believe useful.  If
you build a configuration file for a new system, you will need
to send this back.  You will have to collect some performance
data.  You will need to provide some honest, critical feedback on
utility, clarity, documentation, etc.

    You will need to do all this by about October 21.


Are you interested?
===================

    If so, please fill out the form at the end of this message, and
send it to (genek@mentor.cc.purdue.edu).  We will only take two or
three respondents for each system type for the beta test.

    Please allow some time for processing and selection of
beta-testers.  I promise to reply to all requests as
expeditiously as possible.

    A formal release of Tripwire is planned for sometime in
November.  Watch this space for details!

Subject: Interactive UNIX virus? (UNIX)

In the first days of september 1992 several UNIX-systems in our place
got damaged. Files in the /etc - directory had been changed to special
files, so that they had to be removed, before the system could be
brought up again.

Is anything known about similar problems elsewhere? Maybe, there's a
virus!
