Subject: Telephonica and Floppy Discs (PC)

Hi

We have had a lot of experience with telephonica, but have just come up
with a novel situation. Can anyone help (intellectual question, rather
than physical).

Our 386 machines run Dr. Solomons' Guard program along with an INT-13h
modifier written by one of our people here that protects a small 'C'
disc (with DOS etc). Anyway, I was carrying out a disinfection of
telephonica as I have done hundreds of times before, typing 'XCOPY A:\
D:\TMP /S /E', without even doing a 'DIR' on the disc, prior to
re-formatting.  Anyway, Guard obediently put up a warning message, this
was bypassed, and the disc motor started.

Then without any warning the computer complained about 'Write Protect on
Drive C' (from out INT-13h program). Now, nothing else was running, and
therefore the only assumption that I can make is that somehow Telephonica
managed to get executed.

My question is whether it is possible for a boot sector virus to be
executed by doing a 'DIR' or other directory access. I believe that this
is impossible, however my experience yesterday gives rise to doubt.

Thanks in advance,

Rob

I Have a batch file who exchanges the config.sys in order to load or not
to load the network, this morning, when I exchanged the files, I came up
with this surprise: the files were'not exchanged, so I copied the
little config.sys over the big config.sys (the one who load the net).

I rebooted and nothing happend: the big config.sys was still there,
then I erased the file and rebooted: config.sys was still there!

I'm using DOS 5.0, I used debug to track down the DOS (I thought it was
a virus), so I went with something like this: DOS is in segment 21, offset
87??, the first instruction is a CLI followed with some CMP (I think this
is the selection routine), at first instance I thought this was a virus,
so to be sure I run Thunderbyte Scan with the -direct option and I was right
that was DOS, then I set Int 21h pointing there, the same thing I do with
Interrupt 13h.

Then I run chkdsk /f, it reported something like 61,000 bytes in lost
clusters, when I told to CHKDSK to write the chages: the changes never
appear in the root directory, the I rerun chkdsk and nothing happends.

I rebooted n-times with a clean-dos-5.0-diskette, erase config.sys and
there it comes again (when I reboot), I transfered DOS to the hard disk
with SYS and nothing works: Worst of all: Any file written to the hard disk
in the root directory gets erased as soon as I try to run a no-existent
program.

Then, i used Norton's SI to search in the device driver chain (looking for
a virus in the driver chain), and with my clean disk and with the maybe-
infected-DOS anything is equal.

When I boot with the clean diskette nothing wrong happends, config gets
deleted and programs run fine.

Any ideas?

"Not worth anything."  Hmmmmm(?) I'm afraid I must disagree at least
somewhat with what you're saying here, Glen.  While it may not be
worth adding a lot of code or significantly slowing down, CRCs
certainly have significant value (at least relative to check sums).
Checksums are susceptable to being oblivious to a rearrangement of
data.  This can happen to individual bytes or entire sectors or
clusters (eg. when a defrag programs fails).

 GJ>In my opinion, CRC's are a marketing gimmick pure and simple.

I can understand why you've decided that Virex wouldn't benefit from
this extra protection, but it's absolutely vital for Integrity Master
users to know that everything is back to normal in their files.  Use
of checksumming (exclusively) would leave the door open to some fairly
common types of file corruption.  By the way, this type of damage is
more common than viral damage based on our customer reports.  Since
detecting viruses is just one job for Integrity Master I think you can
see that CRCs are not merely a marketting gimick for us.

As you state, comparing generic and specific removal capabilities is
difficult.  I would not propose doing so.  I agree, it is indeed a
tremendous plus that UT will not "clean" a file which it can not do
properly.  Many other will fail to properly remove a virus and leave a
user with a damaged files or an unbootable system.  I find it
frightening that (based on my surveys) most users are depending upon
this flawed technology to recover from a virus attack.  VERY
DANGEROUS!  And this reliance is pushed futher by UT's advertising.

Speaking only for myself, I can not suggest someone use a product
which may be technically OK, yet promotes this very hazardous
practice.  Since I believe some of us here on Virus-L may have
some influence with the makers of UT, I believe that they may be
persuaded to make their claims more realistic.  Pardon me for
continuing to hammer on this issue, but it is difficult enough for
Stiller Research to compete with Fifth Generation Systems when
Integrity Master is competing with a product which is perceived as
disinfecting every virus now and forever due to the advertising.
While few readers of Virus-L may buy such a claim, the opposite is
true elsewhere including the FIDO virus echos where exactly such
claims have been made for UT.

I agree with your concern. Was that what R. Riordan

Well, not totally wrong. It works for all the 286 and 386 machines
I've tried it on so far (I used to have an XT around here somewhere:-)
And if you don't find the code as suggested above, that should be a clue
that there may be a ROM BIOS extension, in which case the second
method I suggested should work.

No, certainly not! :-) It was my understanding that R. Riordan
was personally installing this, not user-installed.
You are correct in pointing out that this must only be done
by someone who understands what they're doing.  BTW, another check
you can do before trying to run the code is to search the BIOS
for the code "MOV AX, ####", where #### is the offset of the
start of what you think is the INT13 entry point.  (The BIOS
has to load the vector into low memory, and this code snippet
seems to be fairly universal on the machines I've looked at -
with the exception of some Compaq's.  But, all revs of Compaq
system BIOS I've seen so far always have INT13 entry at 02E12H;
does anyone know of an exception?  Compaq BIOS can be identified
by the string COMPAQ at F000:FFEA).

Yes, this is preferred approach.  This should also work for your XT :-)
( It works for our machines with Hard-Cards installed, which have
ROM BIOS extensions for INT13 ).

Interesting... I had considered that, but there seemed to be too many
pitfalls to implement it reliably.

Over stated.  DOS attributes are implemented in a single-user
single-state environment.  Therefore they can be reset by any process
running in the target system.  Many common viruses that use the DOS
interface, as a matter of convenience and course, simply set all file
attributes OFF.

Novell attributes are an extension of DOS attributes.  They can be set
with normal DOS facilities such as ATTRIB.  However, they are
implemented in a multiuser multiple-state environment.  That is, the
server is an independent process protected from interference on the part
of the client workstation.  The Novell server will reset the file
attributes only for a workstation operating with privilege with respect
to the target directory or file objects.

The user of the workstation authenticated to the server must have MODIFY
rights for the target server object.  This mechanism is reliable and is
not bypassed by any common virus.  Therefore, the use of attributes such
as HIDDEN, SYSTEM, and EXECUTE-ONLY is recommended to resist infection
with a virus.

As with almost any mechanism for resisting viruses, this one is less
than 100 percent effective, in part because user privileges are usually
sufficient for a virus to spread.  If the user of the client workstation
has MODIFY or SUPERVISOR privileges, then the virus can use that
privilege to set all attributes off.

The problem arises when those users with such privileges logon to the
server from a workstation that is already infected with a (file
infecting) virus that attempts to set attributes off.  In the face of
the same behavior, the only difference between the effectiveness of the
ATTRIBUTES and ACCESS RIGHTS is that there are many viruses that attempt
to reset the former and none that attempt to alter the latter.  That is,
the difference is in the behavior of the virus rather than in the
effectiveness of the mechanisms.

As VB points out, it is important that server privileges not be used
routinely.  In addition, it is important that privileged users never
logon to a server from an infected workstation.  That is, a privileged
user must logon only from workstations which they initialize from
known and trusted sources (e.g., WRITE-protected diskette).

As we seem to be playing a little "one-upmanship" here  8-), I'll just
chip in that I heard and read many references to "New Zealand" as an
alias for Stoned well -before- I ever heard of Stoned-2.  One commonly
available reference is on p.62 of Highland's "Computer Virus Handbook" -
this is copyrighted in 1990, but from the contents I'd say mostly
written the best part of a year prior to that.  (Note: I didn't say this
is a definitive reference - just an example of an "early" reference to
"Stoned" as "New Zealand".)

As an aside - I've lost track of how many times I must have typed
"0,0,7", and it was only whilst typing that reply the other day that
this thought struck me ...

FORMAT C: is "remarkably silly" with Stoned -if- the HD was partitioned
with an old or "odd" version of DOS (How many users know what their
HD's were partitioned with?).  It is also "remarkably silly", as Vessilin
points out, in that -all- file linkages, etc will be lost, whereas
without it, often most files can be reconstructed if no satisfactory
backups exist and the contents are worth the time and effort.

Subject: Stoned/SBC (PC)

  Over the weekend, my boss was doing some homework on the PC. He
wasn't having much luck with a simulation program that was given to
members of his class, by the instructor. As an after thought, he ran a
scan against the disk which reported (as he related) NO-INT [STONED].
He ran a scan against the PC and the scan found nothing. He then ran
CLEAN against the disk and it reported that STONED was cleaned off.
  This morning as a precaution, we ran the scan on F-PROT against the
HD.  It reported that one of our programs was infected with SBC. We
rebooted the machine, to clear anything that may cause a false
positive and reran F-PROT.  It reported SBC again, on the same
program. We ran SCAN86 which reported nothing. We ran CLEAN86 against
that program which came up nil, then we reran F-PROT with a disinfect,
which reported that it was unable to disinfect the program.
  I am pretty sure that this is a false positive that we are getting,
but I need to make sure. Any suggestion as to how to verify either
way?

Each hard disk has one MBR which holds enough code to keep going and

Each partition on the hard disk has a Partition Boot Sector,

Only on hard disks.

Yes.

Wrong.  They are files in the normal file area of the partition.  They

			PBR executes these files

Subject: PC virus scanners under UNIX? (PC) (UNIX)

Are there any (PC) virus scanners that run under UNIX?

I think this would help isolate the user from a possible virus.  For
example, we have Suns which have floppy drives: it would be safer (in
a way) to scan the boot sector and the files on the Sun, since there
is no way for a PC virus to infect a Sun.  We also get files through
ftp, so a virus checker on the Sun would also help with this route of
infection.

Probably a bug -- the same behaviour is not present under the current
OS/2 v2.0 beta (6E.304), but I cannot verify under v1.3 as our machine
has no DOS box.

Subject: COPS (security package) for VMS? (VAX/VMS)

Hello,

  A co-worker of mine asked me if there is any software for VMS that
provides the same functionalty for VMS that COPS provides for UNIX.

  Since I didn't know, I thought I would ask the guru's. Of course, it
would be preferable that the software be as expensive as COPS ;). If
this software exists, what exactly does it do? Where can I get it?
what's it called?

  Thanks for your help!

Yes, I have seen a few...  I have also seen several Trojans written
for VMS systems.

If you think you may have one, I'll be happy to discuss it with you
through e-mail.  There are some system routines which can be very
beneficial in detecting/stopping these.

Subject: APL virus reference

The reference to the word "virus" in the APL article was only to point
out that the term was used in that context for modified versions of APL
opers and (if you read my paper from a good copy) was not an example of
the sort of thing being discussed in the paper.

          The first computer virus I am aware of was demonstrated in the
1930s by John von Neumann (a theoretical one of course).  The first real
virus I am now aware of (real taken to mean an implementation on a
working computer) was written in the late 1950s.  It was the first
backup program that copied itself onto the backup media and could be run
from there.  I know of several such systems that operated on punched
paper tape in the 1960s.  Of course some might claim that the first
"bug" in a computer met the definition of a virus because it was a
self-replicating biological entity, but I am not certain that it can
actually be run by a computer, and I am quite certain that after being
run, it didn't replicate - it died!

          The first virus given that name was described in 1984 and
demonstrated in November of 1983.  The first network viruses I am
vaguely aware of were supposedly written in the 1960s, but this is all
quite fuzzy since there were only indirect reports of these events in
the Shoch and Hupp paper, and therefore, tyhey cannot be accurately
verified.

          The first virus that can be accurately verified as such and
which was used for the purpose of attack rather than experiment was
launched in the middle 1980s.  I am sorry I cannot give further details.

          If you want to read about viruses, the little black book is
not really that informative.  I had the chance to ask the author why he
used source code instead of pseudo-code (on a radio show in New York),
and he said that he just didn't think it was as informative to provide
pseudo-code as to provide real code.  He did not seem particularly
malicious nor did he seem unreasonable.  Perhaps we should seriously
consider the good and bad points of publishing a book on viruses with
real virus code.

          As to integrity checkers, it is clear from your many articles
back and forth on the subject that most of you haven't thought the
matter out very well.

          There are and have been integrity checkers that defeat all
current and probably most future stealth viruses - even in the
partition table!

          Several integrity checking systems are "perfect" at repairing
infected files that they are able to repair.  The ASP Integrity Toolkit
either does it right or tells you that it couldn't (assuming you have
not told it to be silent about things).

          By the way, I now have an at least relatively permanent
temporary network mailing address.  DO NOT USE THIS TO SEND PRIVATE
MESSAGES - If you want confidential communication with me, I am now
providing RSA messaging for the PC, and you can use my system to do
this.  Get in touch with me for details.

                    Antiviral checklist - part 7

                          For each office: (cont.)

_ Log of disks/programs received

Many large companies think they already have this.  Many smal
companies see this measure as far too draconian.  As usual, the truth
lies somewhere in between.

Corporations, both large and small, and government departments, often
have policies restricting the use of software.  Usually these schemes
make some statement regarding bringing disks and software into the
office.  These policies are, of course, universally disregarded, even
by those who drafted them.  Such procedures are unnecessarily
restrictive, unworkable, and fail to address the issues that prompted
them in the first place.

The intent is good.  The institution wishes to protect the copyright
of authors and other companies (or at least wishes to avoid being
sued for failing to do so).  The policy is also supposed to prevent
the intrusion of viral and trojan software into the company, and, in
some cases, the extraction of sensitive data from company files.

Unfortunately, I have yet to see such a policy which actually does
so.  In most cases, the procedures are both insufficient to the
intended outcome, and damaging to normal business practice.  I will
use some examples from the government of Canada.  (Anyone gloating
over the foolishness of this institution does not know the policies
within their own company.)

The Treasury Board is the governing body in financial matters, and
therefore publishes directives covering pretty much all aspects of
federal government practice.  Several years ago, it published a
circular stating that all computer related software or hardware had
to have an associated purchase order before it entered government
premises.  At first glance, this would appear to be sound, and even
an advantage for software companies.  Not so.  If you are reviewing
software, a local government office cannot afford to purchase the
necessary variety of software and still keep within its budget.  Of
course, it *is* possible to cut a P.O. for the software for no money.
This takes about as long as the review process itself, as well as
potentially putting the software company at risk (there being other
policies regarding minimum and maximum pricing).  Even if you intend
to purchase the software next fiscal year, you cannot review it in
this fiscal year if you have no funding left for that line item, or
cannot afford to "lose" that funding this year.
