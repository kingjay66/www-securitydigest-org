A virus isn't going to *infect* a hard drive that way. On machines
with CMOS setup, *all* the info about the drive is determined by the
info in the setup. # of heads, cylinders, sectors per track, etc.

A virus *might* try testing access with all of the possible drive
types (over 40 on many machines) but picking the wrong one will result
in a BIOS level error, with attendant error message. It would be
*very* noticeable, especially since as soon as it tried to access the
drive, the drive access light would come on (it doesn't if you tell
the machine that there is no HD).

I really don't think any virus author is going to waste time and
effort on trying to find such a drive. It'd tie up the virus for
*minutes*, generate some noticeable physical effects (the drive
light), and could be a waste of time (if there really *wasn't* a hard
drive).

Well it could be a virus. On the other hand, guess what gets written to
sectors when you format a disk? There are *lots* of ways to caused a porly
behaved program to do that to the FAT... I'd test anyway, just to be on
the safe side.

Yes indeed, and I would add that turning off your computer and waiting
for the threat to pass sounds a lot like giving in: "Okay, virus
writer, you win, I won't use my computer because of your virus."  If
people start doing that, as Vesselin pointed out, computers would
become large paper weights. I'd rather get infected!! well...almost :)

The idea of setting the clock has probably been suggested largely
because it is easy to do, and doesn't take much time. This is
understandable, but the virus situation is such that to protect
yourself requires a time investment.  But it is well worth it.  The
plans that the people on this list suggest typically include a regular
backups, something that pays for itself even if you never get hit with
a virus.  And the time investment is biggest to set up a prevention
scheme. Once procedures are in place and part of your (or your
company's) routine, the time spent is minimal.

Subject: Re: Weird Joshi (PC)

    The problem you ran into with Joshi has a fairly simple explanation:
 Joshi, as you know, infects boot sectors.  The boot sector contains some
 data about the disk as well as the bootstrap loader program (which you
 probably also knew).  This data includes such things as the media
 descriptor (5 1/4", 3 1/2", etc.), the number of bytes per sector,
 sectors per track, tracks per cluster, FAT's, root directory entries,
 etc.  DOS needs this information to access the disk.
    Your floppy was infected, no doubt about it.  But your hard disk
 wasn't, and Joshi was not active in memory.  Now, you do a DIR of the
 infected diskette.  To do this, DOS reads the root directory, BUT FIRST
 IT READS THE BOOT SECTOR!  It reads it into a buffer, and uses the data
 contained therein.  It does NOT execute the code, so Joshi never gets
 control.  Then, when you run F-PROT and it goes looking through memory
 for viruses, Joshi is found in the DOS buffer into which it had been
 read.  Although Joshi is not active in memory, F-PROT either doesn't
 realize this, or takes the conservative course, and reports it.  And
 well it should.
    The reason you saw this behavior under MS-DOS 5.0 but not under HP
 MS-DOS 3.30 or 3.20 is presumably that HP MS-DOS reuses the buffer into
 which it read the boot sector for the root directory sectors, whereas
 MS-DOS 5.0 keeps the boot sector around so that it doesn't have to read
 it again if you access the same diskette.  I think someone on this list
 mentioned that you can press Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Break, which will force DOS
 to flush its buffers and reload them on the next diskette access.  Could
 someone confirm this?
    Anyway, all you're seeing is the ghost of Joshi in memory.  Disinfect
 (or reformat) the diskette and any others which may be infected and you
 should have no more problems.

Not randomly. There is a perfectly good reason why the Turbo Pascal
library causes a false positive. Kamikaze is a pretty silly
overwriting virus, written in a high level language. In Turbo Pascal,
more exactly. While such viruses have virtually no chances to spread
(although I personally caught this one in the wild, but this was in
Bulgaria anyway <grin>), it is extrememly difficult to select a good
scan string for them. The reason is that most of their body consists
of library routines, and if you happen to pick something from there,
you'll get a false positive in any program, which is compiled by the
same compiler and contains the same library. Or in the library itself.

However, I think that Frisk corrected this problem. Maybe your version
of F-Prot is outdated; try 2.02d (available from Simtel20, garbo, and
many other places).

Just a (wild) guess. Do you run any other (resident) form of virus
protection? Like the one that comes with Central Point Anti-Virus? If
so, remove it and check whether the "virus" (actually a ghost false
positive) will disappear.

"TIME" is a not very often used alias for the Monxla viruses. There
are two Monxla viruses (A and B), both are Vienna variants.

Hmm... Anti-kot is a Russian program, right? If the guy has been in
Russia (or anywhere in East Europe), chances are that he has brought
the virus as well... :-)

Are they -really- infected or just flagged as such? This is easy to
check, just load them with a text editor and see what's inside.

Well, if you really have the virus, the above is not strange, since
the virus infects only files in the current directory and in the
directories, listed in the PATH variable.

I can't tell for sure, because I have not seen an infected program,
and I don't know the anti-kot program well. I advise you to try some
other scanners. For instance, F-Prot 2.02d calls these viruses Vienna
(Monxla-A) and Vienna (Monxla-B). SCAN 86-B calls both viruses Vienna
[VHP].

Anyway, if you are really infected, be sure to remove the infection
before March 13, since on 13th of any month this virus will damage the
files it tries to infect.

It is certainly a false positive.

Basically, nothing else than spreading. However, this is a polymorphic
virus, the decryption routine and infective length of which vary a
lot, so it is extremely difficult to locate all the infected files.
Otherwise, this is a Vienna-related virus, non-resident, and infecting
only COM files in the current directory and in the directories, listed
in the PATH variable.

> 	2) Is it possible that virex-pc 2.0 is in error?

It is almost certainly an error. Please report it to Microcomm (the
producers of Virex-PC) or to Ross Greenberg (the author of the
program).

Subject: False Positives with Virus Scanners (PC)

  Thought I would pass on an interesting experience for those of
you who have to check out virus reports on other people's machines.
  I recently got a call from a staff member who said when he
booted from his hard disk the scanners reported it infected with
the Pakistani Brain virus and said to immediately
turn off the machine until it was disinfected.
When he booted from a clean floppy as we had instructed people
to do, his scanners reported that he was clean.
  I checked it out with F-Prot (which said he had the Brain) and
Scan (which said he had Invader) and VirX (which said he had
every virus! - I quit counting after 17).
  Further investigation showed he is using the Central Point
Anti-Virus product and the above scanners were triggering on
the VWATCH.SYS and VSAFE.SYS files. When we removed these files
from the hard disk, all scanners reported the machine clean.
 I'm not sure why these files triggered the message unless they
pick up the signatures that Central Point is using and think
it is the actual virus.
  Hope it can save someone else some valuable investigative
time.

Subject: Problem with McAfee CLEAN against the FORM virus (PC)

We - at the Academic Computing Centre of Utrecht University (ACCU),
the Netherlands - have tried to remove the FORM virus from several
hard disks using McAfee's CLEAN version 8.3B86. All disks were larger
than 60 MB, formatted with DOS 5.0, some with one large partition,
others with multiple partitions (C:, D:, etc.).  CLEAN always reports
removal of the [FORM] virus, but in the meanwhile it often destroys
the boot sector of partition C:, making the partition unreachable at
the next bootstrap. Although the FORM virus puts the original
bootsector at the end of the hard disk, CLEAN isn't able to find it.

(So does F-PROT 2.02D of Fridrik Skulason, but at least this program
correctly reports that it can't find the original bootsector, instead of
messing up the system).

It seems quite simple to locate the original bootsector at the very end of
the hard disk. Why then do both these programs not succeed?

Booting the network would mean booting the server, as was implied by

that's the way I read it.....

=If you boot a workstation from an infected disk, the workstation will

In the case of a boot-sector infector, this is correct. In the case of
an executable infector, executables that the user has write
permissions to will most certainly get infected on the network drives.
If another user then executes one of those, their system becomes
infected. For this reason, anyone using supervisor logins or having
supervisor-equivalency can do *serious* damage to a network if they're
not careful. I scan my server daily, and every floppy I put into my
workstation, shrink-wrapped or not.

  [ re: servers ]
=The possibility of infection of the network is the same as for a
=workstation.

Actually, if an infected NetWare server was able to boot, I don't
think the infection would spread. It's a totally different environment
in there; even though the BIOS calls are the same, memory is handled
in a totally different manner, and I just can't see how it would do
anything other than crash on attempting to boot. An executable
infector on a NW 3.11 server could infect everything in the DOS
partition, but couldn't get to the files in the NW volumes, or infect
workstations.

Note that I'm not going to go infect my server to test any of this,
either.... :-)

Subject: Manufacturing of software (GENERAL)

  I was looking in the Virus-L archives in Jan. 1990 (v3i12) and read
the discussions then concerning shrink-wrapped software. I've also
seen the recent reports of software distributors shipping their
product infected with the Michelangelo virus.

  Can anyone respond to (a) How do software publishers tend to produce
the physical disks -- in house or by contract to another business, (b)
How is this software copied to the disks (xx thousands of copies), and
(c) How often and what type of quality checks are being performed?

  I'm sure that there are as many variations as there are companies,
but I'm wondering what the normal practice is. Personally, I never
trust any software with regards to viruses irregardless of the source.
But it is frustrating to hear of these reports of Michelangelo being
distributed via commercial software. Maybe it is time for the lawyers
to test the laws concerning merchantability.
