Some BIOSes use the top 1KB of the DOS 640KB area as an extension to
the BIOS data area at 0040:0000, so 1KB missing at the top of DOS
memory might be quite normal.

Boot clean and then try MEM. The figure you see reported after a clean
boot is the "normal" figure for your PC. If you boot from hard disc and
see less than "normal", you may then get worried..

Subject: F-Prot's (v2.05) memory scanning. (PC)

After hours of failing to get Windows to install, the owner suddenly
announced he thought his computer might be infected.  I ran F-Prot
straight away and sure enough it announced it had detected 'Stoned' in
memory.  I booted from my clean floppy and when running F-Prot again
it claimed the hard-disk was infected with not 'Stoned' but
'Michaelangelo'.  I assumed the disk must be infected with both but
let F-Prot clean 'Michaelangelo' anyway, expecting the boot sector to
now become infected with 'Stoned'.  (That would be right, wouldn't
it?)  However after this cleaning, and clean booting again, F-Prot
declared the disk clean.

Q's 1) Could his hard disk still infected with 'Stoned' and/or
          'Michaelangelo' and F-Prot can't detect either for some
          reason?

   or 2) Was F-Prot's detection of 'Stoned' in memory actually a
          mis-identification of 'Michaelangelo'?

Subject: Re: How good is Norton Antivirus? (PC)

I orignally tried to E-mail this, but the mailer here doesn't know
about ".dk" as a domain name.

you write:
>How does Norton Antivirus compare to other virus programs, such as
>F-prot and Vscan, apart from that Norton is commercial? Norton is

>because the other programs are better?

It's because the others are better. :)

>scanner". It must be possible to give some unbiased measures of an
>antivirus program, such as
>Approximately how many viruses does it detect?  Does it detect all the

It is very hard to give an "unbiased" measure of an antivirus program.
Even the number of viruses detected is hard to measure.  How do you
tell whether two closely related viruses are "different"?  Even
discerning whether two infected programs are infected with different
viruses is a subjective judgement.

The frequency of upgrading is important, and easiy measured.
Generally speaking, commercial programs are upgraded less frequently,
due to the costs of new packaging, distribution, and removing the
"old" version from the shelves.  Shareware has the definite advantage
here since it has no packaging, and it is especially simple to remove
the old product from the "shelves".

Other possible determinations to think about:
  + How does it detect new/unknown viruses?
  + Is it easy to use?  How well does it cope with users who might not know
    what they're doing?
  + How much does it cost?
  + Does it offer advice on how to "properly" detect/remove viruses?
  + Does it include a TSR scanner so frequent scanning of the entire drive is
    not needed?

Currently NAV is not highly regarded by independent "experts" such as
Vesselin.  He checks many, many scanners and is probably the best
source for impartial review.  Many of the other experts market their
own products, so they may be biased in their own favor.

Some of the programs I'm biased in favor of:
  + F-prot
     Not only can it detect virtually all known viruses, it also detects many
     unknown viruses.  It includes a TSR to catch viruses before they can
     spread.  It carefully identifies any virus before trying to disinfect it
     from a file.  Best of all it's free for users on their own personal
     computer at home.  $1 US per CPU otherwise.
  + Integrity Master
     While this program is a poor virus scanner in and of itself, it is very
     useful as an integrity checker to catch anything that might wiggle its
     way through F-prot.

Some of the programs I'm biased against: (Please note that these are
not necessarily reviews of the most recent scanners available.  Once I
find a product I don't like, I usually don't go out and buy a new copy
just to see if it's still as bad as before...;-)

  + SCAN
     McAfee associates consistently refuses to adequately upgrade their
     scanner.  Many people have noted problems (bugs, missed viruses, etc.)
     that reappear version after version.  One serious problem with CLEAN is
     it doesn't check to see if the virus you are asking it to disinfect is
     even present.  If you enter the wrong thing, it will trash the program.
     Sometimes SCAN will mis-identify a virus, and the same thing happens.
     SCAN's virus naming strategy is also cryptic at best, and changes from
     version to version.
  + CPAV
     CPAV does not coexist well with other antivirus programs.  It gives false
     positives, and misses many viruses.  It is a complete pile.

Anyway, I hope this helps you out some.  While it is not possible to
give "unbiased" information about scanners, the above is what my
experience has told me.

What I'd like to see in a scanner:
   + A notice advising the user that booting from a clean floppy is a good
     idea if the program is run from the HD.
   + A notice telling that user that disinfection can result in file damage,
     and many times the program will be changed even if it still functions.
   + A uniform naming sceme, such as CARO.  Maybe just a command line switch
     to turn on CARO naming versus the "standard" proprietary naming schemes.
   + A database of viruses detected and what they do, even just detailing the
     mode of infection.  More info would be nice, tho.  (F-prot is pretty
     good about this, although it would also be nice to know where in the file
     or disk the viral code lies.)
   + The ability to allow the user to add new scan strings, including the use
     of wildcards.  (F-prot does this w/o wildcards.)

What I'd like to see in an integrity checker.
   + Integrity data kept off the hard drive, or in a single file on the hard
     drive.
   + Option to tell the program never to check certain files, such as Stacker
     volumes which will almost always show up as changed.
   + The same "clean boot" notice as above.

What do all you developers think?  Any of these reasonable?

Vesselin also mentioned that MBR infectors that only use 1k are 
rare, in his response to the same query.  This is a bit of a 
concern, given that another notice mentioned that the Monkey
virus is a problem at a location in Ottawa.

Most of the Empire family, including Monkey, take only 1k of
memory from the "top of memory".  While these viruses are 
rare, so far, worldwide, they are common in the Edmonton area,
and I have heard of reports in Ottawa, and several locations
in the USA. 

I have a request.  If anyone has seen any of the Empire variants
(including Monkey) anywhere outside Edmonton, or on Vx BBSs, please
send me a note.  I suspect some of these viruses will be common
pests worldwide, in the future.

Second request: Vesselin, Frisk, Dave Chess, others in the anti-virus
(research) business: have you had reports of Empire viruses being
seen outside Edmonton?

Thanks,
 
Tim.

This is a disturbing notice: it represents the first evidence of 
the Monkey virus getting beyond Edmonton, Alberta.  

The Monkey virus is a member of the Empire family, and a distant
cousin of Stoned.  The Empire viruses are fairly rare, worldwide,
though they are the main virus problem in the Edmonton area, next
maybe to Stoned.  

The Monkey virus has a couple curious characteristics that can
make it particularly frustrating, if people don't know how to
deal with it.  First, Monkey doesn't save the partition table 
in place in the infected MBR of a hard disk.  This means that
if the infected system is booted from a diskette, the hard disk
appears to be inaccessible.  Any attempt to use drive C: will
result in a "invalid drive specification" or some such error --
I forget the exact wording! 

Second, and more frustrating, is that the clean MBR is encoded
before it is saved to the hiding place (sector 3).  This means
the MBR must be decoded if one wishes to restore it directly.
Otherwise the MBR must be restored from a backup copy, or the
table re-entered using a partition table editor such as Norton
Utilities.  The DOS 5.0 DEBUG /MBR option simply leaves a piece
of the virus in the partition table area.  Fortunately this
piece is not virulent; unfortunately it is not a partition
table either!

Third, the Monkey virus specifically (and successfully) 
bypasses Padgett's Disk Secure program.  This virus represents
a rare case: a very specific attack against a very specific
disk security system.  Fortunately most scanners will find 
the virus in memory.  Again this stresses the importance of
having a multi-layer antivirus strategy.

Fourth, Monkey uses stealth on both the MBR and diskette boot sectors,
stopping the system from seeing or changing them.  To remove the
virus, you MUST boot the system from a clean diskette.  Or use my
KILLMONK program: it knows how to get past this stealth.

The Monkey virus has no intentional data damaging strategies.
(Some of the Empire viruses have; in particular the one 
reported wild in the USA has.)  Many of the "bugs" of most
Stoned-derivatives have been fixed in Monkey -- the only 
problem I would forsee is if Monkey infects a 2.88Mb or
other unusual format diskette.  On the 4 common formats,
Monkey successfully hides the clean boot sector (encoded
again) in the bottom of the root directory.  But if it doesn't
recognize a diskette type as being one of these four, the
boot sector is placed on side 1, sector 3.  I don't know the
2.88Mb format, but I suspect this location is in one of the
FAT tables. 

If anyone has trouble dealing with the Monkey virus, or any
other Empire viruses, send me a note.

Tim.

As most of my time and those of my staff are usurped by responding to
customers' letters and issues which have filtered through our Tech
Support and Corporate Support personnel, I would venture a guess that
Symantec's customers, instead of asking in a forum that is a voluntary
exchange of information, pick up the phone and/or use another medium
that requires a response.

What this may point out is that the purchase of NAV does not simply
get you a program, it buys you the aid of all the technical staff at
the Peter Norton Group.  My staff and I are ready to resolve any
incidents or simply help educate.

Oh, no, not another one.  Please, where is aron01.gs.com?  
If it's not in Edmonton, then I'm afraid Monkey is getting
around.

SCAN can't access the hard disk file system, but CLEAN should
be able to access the virus and the hidden, proper MBR.  I 
don't know if CLEAN v97 can remove Monkey, though.

Monkey complicates the removal process in three ways:
1. the partition table isn't saved in the virus body, so 
   FDISK /MBR won't work.  Nor will Norton's NDD.  And
   booting from a floppy means you can't read/use the hard disk
   file systems.
2. The clean MBR is encoded before it is stashed away in sector 3.
   This trips up software like Padgett's FixMBR (or whatever it's
   called - sorry Padgett!)  because FixMBR can't find a proper
   partition table when it scans the "hidden" sectors.
   Any scanner/cleaner software that grabs the MBR from the
   hiding place (sector 3) must decode it before writing it
   to sector 1.
3. The virus uses stealth against reads and writes of sector 1,
   which is why it can't (easily) be removed while resident.

Because Monkey has been assumed to be a rare virus, found only in
the Edmonton area, and we have ways to deal with it here (KILLMONK),
and cleaning a Monkey infection isn't as trivial as cleaning a
Stoned or Michelangelo infection, I think some of the anti-virus
software writers haven't made it a priority to add routines to
remove Monkey.  

Technical: how to clean Monkey:
The proper partition table is still in the proper MBR, which is
encoded, in sector 3 of side 0, track 0.  The encoding (assuming
what you have is one of the two known variants of Monkey) is a
simple XOR 2Eh on every byte of the sector.  To recover the disk,
then, you must read side 0 track 0 sector 3, (using Int 13h, from 
a clean boot) decode every byte with an XOR 2Eh, and if the result
looks like a proper MBR, write the result to side 0 track 0 sector 1.
It can all be done with debug, assuming you have debug on a floppy,
and you know what you are doing.

But it isn't trivial, so instead you might want to get a copy of
my KILLMONK program, which does that and more for you.  It uses
some careful identification strings, checks that the recovered MBR
is correct, etc.  Also makes scanning and cleaning of floppies 
easy.  And strictly speaking, it doesn't require a clean boot, as
long as the only virus messing things up at the time is Monkey.

I think KILLMONK may have been posted at some of the ftp sites.
If you can't find it, or want me to send it (uuencoded) via
e-mail, drop me a note.  (It's free of course, and worth every
virtual cent!)

It sounds like you downloaded a damaged copy of NETSCAN Version 97
that was on our BBS for about four hours before it was discovered and
replaced with a new .ZIP file.  You can download the current (97-B)

I understand that, believe me.  We will fix any such problems reported
to us.  However, we also have to look at new viruses as well as add
the occasional new feature.  Our programmers are also becoming
responsible for an increasing number of new programs, which further
limits the amount of time they have.  This means that they must
prioritize their work.  If a new virus is not detected by VIRUSCAN or
one of the existing options does not work correctly, then they are
going to be looked at first, before a virus which has a "double hit"
(i.e., two different viruses being reported in the file) on it.

That's not to say we're not going to fix it, all reported bugs are
fixed, eventually.  However, their severity, that is, their impact
upon the end user, has to be decided first.

SCAN should be doing that, which indicates (to me) a problem with
either the detection method, or the string being looked for.  Our
programmers will be looking into this one, shortly.

Sounds like a memory shortage problem to me - as if you are very close to th
limit of memory needed to run the program.

The problem is that the memory requirements of the program have been growing,
as the number of viruses has been increasing.  I have a plan, which should
take care of that, but those changes will not be implemented until in version
2.07.

SCAN V97 is known to generate an exception error when run with some
memory managers under DOS.  I have not had any reports of problems
running it in a VDM (DOS session) under OS/2 V2.  I would recommend
that you upgrade to the current version of SCAN, 97-B.  It can be
found in the Simtel20 archives or any of its mirror sites, or in the
pub/antivirus directory of the mcafee.com site (IP# 192.187.128.1) as
scanv97b.zip.

You may wish to considering installing the OS/2 V2.00 Service Pak.
The beta version is, well, a beta version.  Your IBM representative in
Sweden should be able to tell you about the availability of a
Swedish-language SP.

PS: SCAN 97-B with the /UNATTEND switch (required for Windows or OS/2
DOS sessions) runs great on my PC: 483-33 clone with OS/2 V2.00 with
Service Pak installed.

Thank you for saying this!  This is the real life world in which we
live.  This is the root of the differences between the philosophies
espoused by the academics and the words this forum has heard from some
of the people who represent products.

Products have to be concerned with being fast (invisible) during the
normal course of a day's work.  The normal course is one where there
are no viruses on the system.  When a virus is detected, the big guns
get called and they arrive to work in a different environment, where
there is known to be a virus.  That would imply a different set of
tools.

The program is an alarm system.  You don't house firemen in everyone's
homes.

Congratulations & it *can* be done with integrity managagement. IMHO
viruses are a done deal, the real concerns need to migrate to LANs and

Personally, that has never been a concern since what I give away is
rarely what I am working on today and by giving thing away this means
that others put their good people on figuring it out. This puts them
further behind.  Next, the calls for help tell me where they are and I
have spent my life working myself out of a job anyway (gets boring
doing the same thing).

Do admit to holding some things back since am reluctant to provide a
tutorial for the adversary. Major problem nowadays is compatability
with new software such as QEMM "stealth" and "32BitDiskAccess".

To "impact my income (in a negative way)" implies a positive income to
impact. I have a reasonable eight-year-old-car-for-commuting type
income but my job has nothing to do with PCs (as I am repeatedly
told). But then my whole aim in life is to never think about money.
What I have found is that the *best* toys you either get for free or
you do not get them at all.

  			Serious Note (well sorta)

What we really need is a properly funded National Computer Security
Laboratory - not for profit so donations can be written off, coupla
million seed for toys, moving, and a proper site, Fred as chief
scientist, me as chief cable splicer and translator for Fred. Lee
Iacocca or Ross Perot as fund raiser, Al Gore can be "worthy
figurehead" as long as he is willing to learn.

I've said this before and support anything that even looks like it
*might* be a starting point but think it was a disgrace when NIST
abandoned the PC two years ago (I understand the funding problem and
the government is "officially" POSIX - not the first time the sun has
been told to rise in the West), and it was a disgrace that the
Michelangelo hysteria got so far out of hand (and would have been lots
worse if Mich had been written by a professional).

Unfortunately, it is probably going to take a real disaster for
anything to happen (Homer Simpson may push the wrong button yet) and
then watch out for the backlash.

Several of us breathed a sigh of relief when election day passed
without any real incidents - worst I've heard about was the box in
California that sent a "No" for every "Yes" vote and vicea-versa -
wonder how those voters felt when told that "it really did not matter
anyway".

But then I was relieved that no suitcases went off on Jan 15, 1991 -
good thing the Soviet Union did not break up a couple of years
earlier.

Well, WordStar does a nice job (when I remember to use it) - you must
be using a UNIX box - even the VAX allows editing of MAIL - or maybe a
CRAY ?

Subject: CHRISTMA effects (CVP)

HISVIRI.CVP   921022
 
                    CHRISTMA EXEC - the effects
 
The exact number of copies made by any one reading of the CHRISTMA
EXEC would depend upon the number of listings in the NAMES file, and
the messages received by the NETLOG file.  However, for all intents
any nuclear physicist knows that it only needs to be, on average,
"greater than one".  The CHRISTMA EXEC would destroy itself, after
having been read, but more copies would be created than destroyed.
 
Some of the newly spawned messages would "die" a natural net death,
being outdated accounts, or directed at those who were on holiday
(or, perhaps, executives and managers, who, of course, never read
their email :-).  Most, however, would reach a working account, and
a mildly (but likely not sufficiently) curious user.  The user would
type "Christmas", see the tree, shrug and dismiss the message ...
while a number of new messages would be created and head off in all
directions.
 
Eventually, a large number of users would be reading, and
inadvertantly sending, copies of the message.  Therefore, a large
volume of mail would be being generated, using up a large chunk of
bandwidth.  Eventually, in some cases, all the available bandwidth. 
Some machines were essentially cut off from the net ... with the
exception of the CHRISTMA "cards".
 
In addition to bandwidth, CHRISTMA consumed disk space.  The
individual messages would not be large, but the numbers of them
would start to consume significant amounts of disk drive real
estate.  Mail spool entries would also be used up.  Not only would
they be used up on the system itself, but users' mail directories
would start to show repeating listings for the CHRISTMA EXEC,
crowding out other, more important messages.  (Most of this crowding
would be psychological, but occasionally it would be physical, as
system limits were reached.)
 
The general "disinfecting" action taken was to shut down the system,
and purge all copies of the message from the mail spool.  However,
since the transmission was "cross-system", users would have to be
warned to be on the alert for the message when received from an
outside source.  The major impact was mostly confined to the period
of December 9th, 1987, to December 14th.  IBM's internal network,
VNET, was more heavily hit than either EARN or Bitnet, and drastic
action, in the form of a general system shutdown, was felt to be
needed to clear up the mess.  (VNETers seemed to be more severely
affected because of larger NAMES files.)
