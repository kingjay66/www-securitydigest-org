Just what we really need, a joker who still thinks that these things
are funny :-(

The simulations are there so that you can demonstrate what they do,
not play games that make viruses seem like harmless pranks, at best,
and even worse, spread false alarms around that encourage people to
ignore sympotoms and/or warnings.

Too many of use are spending too much of our time trying to fight off
such attitudes to be amused. I also noticed that the coward wouldn't
even put his name on his note. Perhaps I can think of a more
descriptive number for him, something slightly less than 70, perhaps?

I am also interested in learning more about polymorph.  My boss read
about it in a magazine and had me write a program that will document
the length of every com and exe.  On subsequent runs it will check to
be sure the file length is the same and add or delete executables that
have been created or deleted.

Since I wrote the program I have learned that some of the "stealth"
viruses are smart enough to change the length data so that when a dir
listing is done you will so the old length of the file instead of the
actual length.  How many viruses can really do this??  How usefull is
the program that I wrote??

This does happen if the internal battery is getting weak.  If you run

The machine will -try- to read the boot sector. If the diskette is not
formatted, it obviously won't succeed. In this case it will proceed as
if no diskette is present.

Not "will". "Might". Some viruses (Stoned, Michelangelo) infect the
hard disk immediately, while others (Ping Pong, Typo) wait until DOS
is loaded and infect the hard disk when DOS accesses it for the first
time (during the device initialization process). And, of course, if
the boot sector virus is a floppy-only infector (Brain, Den Zuk), it
won't infect the hard disk at all.

Right.

The MBR is the first physical sector of the hard disk. That is, Track
0, Side 0, Sector 1. The boot sector is the 0th logical sector of each
partition. There are as many boot sectors as there are partitions,
although only one of them can be active (bootable) at a given moment.

>  - Do only hard disks have Master Boot Records?

Yes.

> Or are they found on floppies, too?

No. It's probably possible to create a floppy with a hard disk
structure (with MBR, partitions, and so on), but it is generally
useless. The initial idea of the partitions was to provide the
possibility to have multiple operating systems on your hard disk and
boot from the one you select. It's a bit difficult to put two
different operating systems on one diskette... :-)

>  - If a disk has a Master Boot Record, does it *also* have a *separate*
>    boot sector, or does the Master Boot Record house the boot sector?

Yes, always. There is always one MBR and as many boot sectors as there
are partitions. In fact, it is possible that only one of those boot
sectors contains executable code. Even more - in theory it is possible
that none of them contains executable code - if you wish to have a
non-bootable hard disk.

>  - If a hard disk has only one partition (e.g. a "C:" drive, but no
>    others, right?), is there a partition table?

In the partition table there is place for exactly 4 entries. No more,
no less. If you have only one partition, then only one of the entries
contains data (although not necessarily the first one). If you want
more than 4 partitions (possible with DOS 3.3 and above), one of the 4
partitions is marked as "extended". In fact, it points to another
partition table sector (chained to the MBR), which contains yet
another 4 PT entries and so on.

>  - I assume that DOS's 2 hidden files are stored in either the boot
>    sector and/or the Master Boot Record (MBR), correct?  Which one?

No, you are wrong. There is just no place for them there - the two
hidden files can occupy more than 100 Kb and a sector is only 0.5 Kb.
The two hidden DOS files are stored usually at the beginning of the
bootable DOS partitions. More exactly, in its data area. Each DOS
partition consists of a boot sector, FAT(s), root directory, and the
rest is the data area.

>    What else, besides the partition table, and viruses, can be
>    found there?

The MBR contains a small program to fetch the entry of the active
partition from the PT, to locate its boot sector, to load it in memory
and to transfer control to it.

In the DOS boot sector there is the BIOS Parameter Block (describing
the parameters of the disk) and a small program to locate the two
hidden DOS files, to load the beginning of the first one, and to
transfer control to it.

Sometimes some protection programs put their own code in the boot
sectors.

I don't know what's the contents of the boot sectors of the other
operating systems (UCSD Pascal, CP/M, Unix...)

First the MBR gets loaded by the BIOS. The program there finds the
active partition, loads its boot sector and transfers control to it.
The boot sector is responsible for loading the operating system in
memory.

Hope the above helps. Feel free to ask me more questions if something
is still not clear.

Yes, you are right. With one slight correction - encrypting the scan
strings -does- change one of the (many) shortcommings of this
technique. If you don't encrypt them, and other virus scanner which
scans the whole file and uses the same signatures will flag your
program as infected.

Yes, I fully agree with you.

Here I slightly tend to disagree. First of all, monitors alone are
even more useless than known-virus scanning. -Any- monitor can be
bypassed, if there is no memory protection. And if you rely -entirely-
on an integrity checker, there is still some chance that a virus can
pass unnoticed.

A good protection scheme must consist of multiple levels. Scanners,
monitors, resident scanners, integrity shells, integrity checkers,
backups. All of them have their place, although the accent must be on
the integrity checkers, since they are the strongest line of defense.

Well, people do not "feel" in percetages and 28 secs is not that much,

Oh, I see... A nice idea. As I said, both products can learn from one

The following? But the review of Stealth Bomber was the last article
in the bulletin. Or, do you mean the previous review, that of PC
Armour? Well, they said quite fairly that it does not provide great
security and that when you boot from a floppy, the hard disk is not
accessible to MS-DOS. It is not, indeed! The fact that the user can
start Norton Utilities in /Manintnance mode and do whatever he wishes
with the hard disk, using only BIOS calls, is a completely different
story... :-)

Well, yes, you are right, but have in mind that the silly claims have
been made by the company that markets the product, not by the
developpers (who have done a pretty good job).

Well, so is in fact the UT's integrity checker, regardless that they
are using it mainly to fight viruses.

> Integrity Master will continue to evolve and learn from its competition.

As somebody wrote on one of the newsgroups, the best thing for the
user is if there are two main competing products for the task s/he
needs done... :-)

This is a questionable statement - scanners have never been a way of
dealing with new viruses. There are feasible ways to change an
existing virus so it will not be detected by a scanner without
"cracking" the scanner. However, the risk from old viruses and
varients is likely to continue to be significant, and scanners are
fine for this.

This hack, like the prior program that created test files containing
virus signatures, demonstrates nothing new except to people who do not
understand how virus scanners work, and the limits this implies.

I beg to differ - this IS generated by the base F-Prot but the wording
("Possibly") indicates that Frisk is, through a "heuristic" (serving
to stimulate investigation or thought) analysis, picking up a specific
bit of code in SafeMBR.com & 2to1.com that replaces the MBR.

Most good systems are gravitating toward a tree based heuristic analysis
for speed - first determine if a program is "suspicious", then try to
identify a specific signature if something is questionable. The text of
the message indicates that F-Prot has found "suspicious" behaviour (which
it has) that does not match any of the known signatures (which it does not)
but has warned the user that it is similar to that used by MBR "droppers"
(which it is).

Incidently, the original SafeMBR.com and its removal tool 2to1.com have been
superceeded by the much more capable FixMBR program which does not trip
F-Prot 2.02d.

Personally, I think this is a *good* but possibly the messages could be
improved e.g. "Program contains BIOS manipulation code similar to a MBR
dropper." Will be even better when he can add "check manufacrurer's
documentation for validation codes" 8*)

Hi:

A professor here at UCR reported the following message on his PC,
running Central Point's VSAFE (I'm told that this is roughly
equivalent to McAfee's VSHIELD):

COMMAND.COM was changed

What he's been doing is deleting his COMMAND.COM, and reloading it
from a master DOS floppy.  He asked me today if he needs to do this,
since his scanning software can't find a virus (he says he's just had
it for a month, and that it can detect Michelangelo).  So, does this
seem symptomatic of a virus?  The next time I talk to him, I'll try to
get a copy of his "modified" COMMAND.COM, if that would help in
tracking this down.

Thanks!

They could have stated it more narrowly. Gatekeeper is a (rather paranoid)
suspicion activity detector, and might well interfere unless appropriate
permissions were granted.  It's not really a product for novice users.

On the other hand the Disinfectant INIT, because it targets a list of
known viruses rather specifically, is much less likely to interfere.

It is rather difficult to detect unknown virus activity while installing
new software.

All this would not apply if one booted from a floppy with a system first.

Yes and No.  Most "installation" programs are glorified file movers.
Vendors could simply note which files/folders to copy where, but prefer
to rely on Installer to do this in a uniform way.
Anti-viral programs will interfer with the Installer.  You can scan
the vendor disks for viruses before removing virus protection from
your computer.  This provides limited protection because much of the
code on commercial diskettes is in a compressed format these days.

For maximum protection I would do the following:
1.  Scan the vendor diskettes for viruses.
2.  Defeat virus protection.
3.  Install software
4.  Scan new software for viruses.
5.  Run the new software.

In practice I rely on backups and assume that viruses on commercial
disks are a relatively rare phenomenon. There is no protection program
or procedure that can absolutely protect from viruses with the exception
of abstenance.  A good backup procedure can reduce the cost of recovering
from viral attack.

I tried this on my system which has IBM OS/2 1.3 Standard Edition, and
XCOPY in the DOS box did not change the file dates. You could possibly
have a virus.  DOS viruses can usually run in the DOS box of OS/2 and
your DOS command files could be infected.  You can easily determine
this by scanning your system with a recently updated scanner after
booting up from a clean DOS diskette.  There are still no
OS/2-specific viruses that I know of.  If this checks out negative, I
would say that it is a bug that might be due to the particular CSD
level of OS/2 you have (the most likely explanation).  You should
report it to IBM, though (if you are using IBM's OS/2, that is).  Hope
this helps!

Subject: heuristic scanners

Upon reflection, I must side with those who want the heuristic
scanners to continue to be available.  The problems of avoiding a
deluge of inquiries from casual users with false positives can be
avoided by including a prominent warning in the documentation that
false positives can occur; and by the previous suggestion of including
it in the FAQ and simply not responding.

Subject: Virus Icon/Logo

My suggestion for a virus logo would be a skull-n-crossbones
superimposed on a larger, approximately-spherical polyhedron, like a
buckyball or something.  Isn't that sort of what viruses look like
(sans the bones) ? It's not really too identifiable by someone with no
clue, but then it isn't an easy concept to iconify!

We have here information from a guy called Joe Dellinger, who claims
to have written the first Apple ][ virus (Elk Cloner). According to
him, it happened in 1981. It seems that there have been three versions
of it (which fixed some of the bugs that made the virus sometimes
cause unvoluntary damage). Do you have more information about that?
Who exactly has the priority? Is Joe Dellinger reading this list and
could he comment on this?

I dont know of an international virus symbol; I mark all my diskettes
that contain live viruses with a strip of BIOHAZARD tape....  This is
yellow with a red symbol of intersecting crescents, and the word
BIOHAZARD in red.  Biohazard tape is available from most laboratory
suppliers.

Hello Everyone!

	I have recently created a new anti-viral FTP site on campus at
University of Texas Medical Branch. The name of the site is
eugene.gal.utexas.edu with a IP address of 129.109.9.21. Eugene
supports anonymous FTP logins and carries up-to-date anti-viral
software. I invite everyone to log in and get the latest in anti-viral
computer software. If you encounter any problems, please send mail to
perry@eugene.gal.utexas.edu. I'll be looking forward to your connect!
