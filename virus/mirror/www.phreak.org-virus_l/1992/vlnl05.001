VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  (The complete set of posting guidelines is available by
FTP on cert.sei.cmu.edu or upon request.)  Please sign submissions
with your real name.  Send contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU
(that's equivalent to VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).
Information on accessing anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue
archives is distributed periodically on the list.  Administrative mail

Subject: Novell Inadvertantly distributes virus with update (PC)

The following is an excerpt from CIAC bulletin C-11.  The infected
distribution occurred ONLY on 5 1/4 inch diskettes.

Karyn Pichnarczyk
- ---------------------

CIAC has learned that Novell, Inc. has inadvertently sent diskettes
infected with the Stoned-3 virus to Novell Netware customers.  These
diskettes are labelled "Network Support Encyclopedia - Standard Volume
Update."  The Novell part number for these disks is 883-001495-004.
Infected diskettes were distributed from December 9 - 16, 1991.

The Stoned-3 virus is a minor variation of the Stoned virus.  This
virus infects the boot sector of a hard disk or diskette and will
sometimes display the message:

	"Your PC is now Stoned!.....LEGALISE MARIJUANA!"

This virus becomes memory resident and will infect any other disks
accessed by the PC while the virus is memory resident.  For additional
information, please see CIAC bulletins A-28 for more information on
the Stoned virus family, and B-16 for a summary of known viruses.

If you discover that the Stoned virus has infected your PC, it may be
removed using the VIRHUNT package. CIAC also recommends that you
follow a policy of scanning all new software before using or
installing it on your PC.  This policy should be followed for all
vendor-supplied shrink-wrapped software as well as bulletin board or
shareware software, since a few other vendors have inadvertently
distributed viruses with packaged software in the past.  CIAC
recommends that if you are from a DOE site and are not already using
an effective anti-viral scanner, you should contact your site's
computer security department to obtain one. In addition, since new
viruses are constantly being discovered, we recommend that you ensure
that your anti-viral scanner has been updated to the most recent
version.

Another way to reset the CMOS is to disconnect the battery.

If it's a soldered-in NiCad, try draining it completely with a light bulb
or other load (unless you *really* want to unsolder it).

Subject: Central-Point Anti-Virus Question (PC)

I gather that CPAV includes a "self-integrity check" routine that can
be appended to files.  My question: is the size of this appendix
constant, or does it vary?  I suspect it varies, in the range of 700 -
1000 bytes.  Can someone who knows the product please confirm or
refute this?

The /MBR parameter of FDISK is an undocumented feature of DOS 5 (both
PC-DOS and MS-DOS) which replaces the code in the Master Boot Record
with a clean copy, but leaves the Partition Table as is.  It is there-
fore effective in removing MBR infections (provided that the virus has
not modified the Partition Table). Although this feature was mentioned
by Bill Arnold in Virus-L/comp.virus half a year ago and in the Virus
Bulletin in its November issue, my experience is that very few people,
even experienced virus fighters, know of its existence, and those who
do  seem to be unaware that it can also be used on machines running
DOS *prior to Ver. 5*.  All that is necessary is to find a (clean) DOS
5 system diskette, to copy FDISK.EXE from DOS 5 onto that diskette, to
cold boot the infected machine from the diskette, and then to perform
FDISK /MBR .  Works beautifully.

The answer to your question is: yes and no.

No, there is no current PC virus which would "infect" mainframes in the 
sense of being active in them.

However, in a networking situation, viral infections can spread "through" 
the medium of a mainframe being used as a server.

Mainframe and network viri or worms may be able to infect PC's in the 
net.  This is due to the more complex nature of mainframe viri, and the 
use of "interpreters" in network machines.  One example is the 
Morris/Internet?UNIX worm which contained "source" code in the most basic 
form which would be interepretted by a number of different machines, as 
well as "object" code for different machines it expected to encounter.  
The CHRISTMA EXEC of a few years back relied strictly upon a common 
interpretted language, REXX.  A PC version of REXX is available, and is 
used in IBM based networks in order to assist in automating 
communications between machines.

However, at present this type of situation is relatively rare.  For the 
moment, infections crossing OS lines are extremely unlikely.

Sigh... :-(( It began to happen... With the source of this incredibly
infectious virus published world-wide, what else do you expect?...

Hmm, strange... The original, as posted, was for a quite weird and
unpopular assembler... (No, -not- A86.) If assembled with MASM/TASM,
it will generate a variant of the virus (perfectly working, though).
Maybe somebody already did this?

He must be kidding! No reformatting is necessary! Just reboot from a
non-infected diskette; delete all executable files; and run CHKDSK/F
on the infected machine. This way you'll lose only the executables,
which you can restore from a clean backup...

Subject: Unknown Mac virus? (Mac)

   A friend of mine was cleaning up his sister's Mac Classic today,
and discovered and removed the CDEF virus using Disinfectant (2.5.1).
He also installed Gatekeeper. Now, later on, we discovered that
starting Microsoft Word generated a Gatekeeper alert; plus, the menus
were printed in the wrong font. Furthermore, the System file was over
1 megabyte, with no DAs or fonts or anything else installed except for
the standard ones that come with every Mac. Worst of all, the Grouch
was deleted without warning from the System Folder while we were
looking around.
   Disinfectant still reported the system clean.

   I haven't been reading this group very regularly of late; is there a new
Mac virus around? (The Mac in question has been at Brown lately.)

   Unfortunately, I don't have a sample: the computer is needed, so we did
a low-level format and reinstalled everything from clean copies.

Subject: General questions about viruses

Can someone help me with the following questions:

1- A virus obviously is a program that is CPU bound, io bound, ..etc.
  i.e. it occupies system's resources.  Some could probably delete
  all files on a system? right?
2- How does it transfer across networks.  How does it know a phone number
   (modem #) of a remote node.
3- How does it get tracked down.  By program name? if so, then what if
   this virus changes its name? are we in trouble?
4- When it makes it to disk, how does it tell the Kernel that it wants
  to run the system.  It it something like a daemon tht sleeps and
  wakes up?

  Thanks in advance

Not yet.  And I don't think there could be.  Not with the major differences
between program execution, and for that matter, operation codes on these
different platforms.  For example, X'D20750006000' in MVS translates to
MVC 0(8,R5),0(,R6) which moves 8 bytes from a location pointed to by
register 6 into a location pointed to by R5.  This hex string, even if
it could be downloaded to a PC in its origional form without get translated
by whatever protocol you happen to be using, is *probably* (I'm not a PC
assembler guru) meaningless once it gets there.  The effort expended in
trying to get something on a mainframe downloaded to a PC and executed there
would be wasted.

Disclaimer:  Then again, I may have no idea what I'm talking about.

		   What's New In VIRx Version 1.9
		   ==============================

Date: 12/17/91

   1.  The licensing agreement for your usage of VIRx has been changed.
   Individual and educational users need not concern themselves with the
   change. For corporate and business users: VIRx may only be used within
   your institution for a 30 day evaluation period.  If you wish to use
   VIRx after that period, please contact Microcom, Inc. at (919)-490-1277
   for information on a site license.  VIRx may not be bundled with other
   products without a written agreement: contact Microcom for details.

   2.  VIRx 1.9 now detects 85 newly discovered viruses, bringing the total
   count to 649, plus innumerable variants.

   3.  There is a known problem with occasional V2P6 false positives.  If
   you encounter a file that VIRx indicates contains the V2P6 virus, please
   leave a message on Microcom's BBS at the number listed below with details
   immediately.  If possible, please upload a copy of the file that is
   generating the V2P6 alert.

   4.  Our BBS is thriving and awaits your visit!  It runs at up to V.32BIS
   speeds.  Please upload suspect files to the BBS, where we'll examine them
   and let you know whether the file contains a virus.  The latest copy of 
   VIRx is always available on the BBS, and we welcome your suggestions and
   comments regarding our products.  You can reach the BBS at (919)-419-1602

   5.  Finally, we are documenting our external signature file.  This allows
   new viruses to be detected without having to wait for a new release of
   VIRx.  You should be careful: if you use the external signature file and
   add a virus signature that we are already using within our internal virus
   signature database, VIRx will inform you that it has found a virus in
   memory.  It is best to call our BBS on a regular basis and to get the
   external signature file that we make available thereon: the virus
   signatures in this file contain only tested strings which will not cause
   any of these problems...

And so on.  Hope we'll hear from you about it.
