I find it very strange to see that SCAN identifies Saturday the
14th virus as Armagedom. Having disassemble the code for both
viruses, I find no particular relationship between the two.

Anybody care to comment.

BUGRES.COM (or whatever it may have been renamed) is a "Resident
Screen-Eating Utility."  It loads TSR, and when activated (the version
I have is activated by ALT-B) a number of character-graphic "bugs"
wander about the screen and "eat" characters in their path, and
continue wandering about the screen until you press a key, which
restores the original screen.  It is essentially a cute screen saver.

I downloaded this file, but was unable to find any infection in GRABSCRN.COM
or in the .EXE file (RAW2GIF.EXE).  I scanned it with NAV 2.0 and McAffee's
SCAN v93.  I then downloaded F-PROT 2.04a and VIRX 2.3 from WUARCHIVE and
tried them...still couldn't find the virus.  From the information I have on
the Wonder (and Wonder-2) virus, it only infects .EXE files (that was why
I played with RAW2GIF.EXE).  I then tried to two executable files with NAV
resident in memory...it still didn't detect it.  Then I looked closely at
them with the Norton Utilities DISKEDIT program.  About the only similarity I
can find with these files and the WONDER virus is that they were both written
in Borland C++.

What version of NAV are you running?  Do you have any other TSRs loaded?
It could be that GRABSCRN combined with something else you have loaded in
memory may be causing a false alarm.  Hope this helps!
Bill Hadley

PS. I downloaded GRABSC11.ZIP from WUARCHIVE too...so I was playing with the
same file that you downloaded.

Technically, yes.  Ethically, morally, no.  An idea, yes, a good one,
no.  A virus designed to destroy other viruses might easily become
more of a problem that the viruses it seeks to destroy.  Depending on
how one defines "virus", one might argue a case for "good" viruses,
but that debate doesn't include viruses designed to seek out and
destroy one another.  Playing "core wars" in real cyberspace is not a
good idea.  :)

This is a quite common misconception that I would like to clear up.
McAfee Associates is located in Santa Clara, a city at the southern
end of the San Francisco Bay.  We are some 330 miles (530km) north of
Los Angeles, about the distance from London to Luxembourg or Perth to
Rawlinna.

Any geologic activity (flooding, earthquakes, giant radioactive ants
from the bowels of the earth, etc.) affecting Los Angeles is not going
to have any physical impact on the northern portion of California.

In case of an earthquake or other event that leaves us stranded
without power for several days, we do have enough laptops to keep the
programmers working although we will have to shut down our technical
support, customer support, order processing, and other non-essential
(well, lower priority, perhaps) services.  Of course, given that our
communication links (fax, telephone, BBS, internet, postal mail) will
be down as way until the restoration of services, these may not have
as much impatct as you thought.

Oh, we do also have a network of agents both domestic (inside the U.S.
and Canada) and international, so anyone could contact them for
support, etc., but the home office would be down for a day or two
(during the October, 1990 earthquake, we were "disconnected from the
electronic world" for about 36 hours).

Hi there,

Just for your info I have downloaded the above file this morning and
F-PROT 2.04 and Bates v3.37 report the unzipped files as being clean.

I receieved two copies of this digest in my mail this morning - can't

I know of one Scream virus - or "Screaming Fist" as it is also called.
There are at least five variants of it, 692, 696, 711 and 838 bytes
long (and one with a variable length). I have not yet written a
disinfector for the 838 byte variant, but I can handle the others.

Ignore this - it is a false alarm.  In fact, ignore everything NAV
says about the Wonder virus.  The virus is written in C or Pascal, and
it seems they are just "detecting" a part of the run-time library.

This is CPAVs fault - they leave the signature in memory.  No other
major anti-virus producer has a similar compatibility problem with the
rest of the industry In fact, even the CPAV manual says you should not
use other anti-virus programs with CPAV. The reason is simple - they
are responsible for too many false alarms.  As it is generally a good
idea to use multiple scanners, the solution is quite simple - don't
use CPAV....combine a few other scanners - they all work

Of course anybody is free to use CPAV, but if you do, please don't use
any other scanner (including my own) on the same machine - you will
get problems.

We have a site licence for V give it to site staff to nice how you can

We are not on the cutting edge of pirate software etc that is a major
source of viruses so I do not encourage people to use the memory
resident parts of VET unless they expect nasty file viruses.  The
memory resident part of VET can cause clashes and eratic behaviour
with some programs.  If you read the manual you are prepared for it,
but just having VET.COM installed makes

VET is also very good at repairing the damage that a virus can cause
to a hard-disk.

Just have a site licence for an anti-viral program makes people aware
the damage they can cause and makes them cautious - and thus we do not
have many infectionRs (1 or 2 a year).

Another advantage of having a program installed on all PC's is that
people no longer blame viruses when their computers play up and
instead look for other software or hardware causes.  Not too long ago,
it used to be very hard to convince PC users that their problem was
not virus related because of all the virus paranoia.

In reference to Padgett's comments on McAfee's GENP / GENY virus

I must agree when you have several thousand PC's to keep CLEAN it's
almost imperative that you know what your coming against.  This type
of identification process makes keeping any kind of useful stats very
difficult.

Try the VET anti-viral program, unlike other programs it is very
good at repairing the damage this virus causes as well as cleaning
the virus of the hard-disk.  Stoned is quite happy to exist on
a hard-disk which it slowly corrupts.  Other anti-viral
programs can wipe the data on the hard-disk by not repairing
the damage Stoned has  caused.

Subject: UK Computer Crime Unit

Over the last 3 months I've had reasonable access to the net and I
have been gradually collecting back issues of virus-l.  I just came
across some mention in December 1990 of the UK Computer Crime Unit.
As there appeared to be little follow up I thought you may like to
know the situation, (as I understand it).

First there is no "UK" unit, in London the Metropolitan Police ("New
Scotland Yard") has a CCU of four officers and a some clerks.  In the
various police districts there are officers who are trained to have
some familiarity with computers.  They will investigate reports, with
the assistance of technical people at the complaining company, other
experts or may refer (some politics in this one) to the CCU in London.

The CCU held a meeting in March 1991 of around 30 people,
opimistically called the National Computer Virus Strategy Group.  The
main result was the report forms mentioned below.  I hope that the CCU
workload will soon reduce, so that they will be able to arrange a
second meeting later this year.

Most incidents reported and investigated are computer assisted frauds
or cracking.  The CCU is not well equipped to investigate virus
incidents, and would call on experts, such as myself, to give
technical assistance.  The CCU has a scheme for reporting virus
incidents, if there is interest I'll post a copy of the forms to Ken
to make available for FTP.

The current purpose of the scheme is to gauge the number of incidents
& financial losses accruing.  This will allow a case can be made to
the appropriate government agencies, (the Home Office and the
Department of Trade & Industry), for funding to expand the CCU and
support it in properly investigating these incidents.  So if you want
to help them to do this you should report all UK virus incidents.

The CCU telephone number is 071 230 1176, virus related matters are
normally handled by Detective Constable Noel Bonczoszek.  Ye olde
postal method: Computer Crimes Unit (CCU), 2 Richbell Place, LONDON

No they don't read VIRUS-L/comp.virus, basically because with such a
small staff and a high work load they don't have the time to browse
and pick out the useful/interesting bits.

I can forward email to the CCU, though this would be a strictly
unofficial arrangement.

Subject: Jerusalem virus part 2 (CVP)

                   The "Jerusalem" virus - part 2

The history of the Jerusalem virus is every bit as convoluted as its
functionality and family.  The naming alone is a fairly bizarre tale.
As mentioned before, it was originally called the Israeli virus.
Although considered unfair by some, it was fairly natural as the
virus had both been discovered and reported from Israel.  (Although
the virus was reported to slow down systems that were infected, it
seems to have been the "continual growth" of EXE files which led to
the detection of the virus.)  In an effort to avoid anti-semitism, it
was referred to by its "infective length" of 1813 bytes.  For COM
files.  For EXE files it was 1808 bytes.  Sometimes.  It varies
because of the requirement that the header of an EXE file is
divisible by 16.  (All quite clear?)

One of the early infections was found to be in an office belonging to
the Israeli Defence Forces.  This fact was reported in an Associated
Press article, and, of course, made much of.  It also gave rise to
another alias, the I.D.F. virus.

When the virus was first discovered, it was strongly felt that it had
been circulating prior to November of 1987.  The "payload" of file
deletion on Friday the 13th gave rise to conjecture as to why the
logic bomb had not "gone off" on Friday, November 13th, 1987.
(Subsequent analysis has shown that the virus will activate the
payload only if the year is not 1987.)  The next following "Friday
the 13th" was May 13th, 1988.  Since the last day that Palestine
existed as a nation was May 13th, 1948 it was felt that this might
have been an act of political terrorism.  This led to another alias,
the PLO virus.  (The fact that Israel celebrates its holidays
according to the Jewish calendar, and that the independence
celebrations were slated for three weeks before May 13th in 1988 were
disregarded.  The internal structure of the virus, and the existence
of the sURIV viral programs seems to indicate that any political
correspondence is merely coincidence.)

Yet another alias is "sUMsDos", based upon text found in the virus
code itself.  This was, on occasion, corrupted to "sumDOS".

The name "Jerusalem" has gained ascendancy, possibly due to the
McAfee SCAN program identification.  (He certainly must be
responsible for the "B" designation for the "original" version.)  Of
course, the great number of variants have not helped any.  Because a
number of the variants are very closely based upon each others code,
the signatures for one variant will often match another, thus
generating even more naming confusion.  This confusion is not unique
to the Jerusalem family, of course, and is an ongoing concern in the
virus research community.
