Subject: Administrivia: Duplicates and missing digests (sigh)

In the last VIRUS-L digest, there were a couple of messages that were
inadvertantly duplicated from a previous digest.  Due (I believe) to a
mailer glitch, these entries had been sent to me multiple times.
Sorry for any inconvenience.

While on the subject of mailer glitches, some of you have been
noticing duplicate or missing digests.  Taking a SWAG, I'd say that
these are due to the same mailer glitch.  The problem(s) is being
looked into.  Again, sorry for any inconvenience.

I'll be updating the archives on cert.org as soon as Issue 199 goes
out, so feel free to look there for any missing digests.

These things would, of course, explain why my incoming VIRUS-L queue
is so long.  I keep doing the same work over and over.  :-)  Now,
let's see if _this_ one comes back to me...

Cheers,

Does anybody know where I can find a file that contains the signatures
of different viruses?  I found a zip file somewhere in the net, but
apparently there is something wrong with the file and I can't unzip
it.

Subject: Fake Dir-II (PC)

Hi Fridrik,

I have discovered a strange behaviour when I scan a little file using
F-prot 2.  06a.

This is what appears on the screen:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------
F-PROT anti-virus program - Version 2.06a - November 1992
Copyright (c) 1990-1992, Frisk Software International
Loading virus information.
C:\0\GM4.COM  Possibly a new variant of DIR-II
- -----------------------------------------------------------------

F-prot says that it is possibly a new variant of Dir-II, and it doesn't say 
that the file is infected by Dir-II, however I am a little worry about it 
because.....I am the author of that program. :-)

I wrote that program using assembler, and I found the piece of source code 
that produces the above warning:

- ------------------------------------------------        
        mov     bx,offset message
        mov     cx,46d
decrypt:
        xor     byte ptr [bx],0ffh
        inc     bx
        loop    decrypt
- ------------------------------------------------

This is a simple routine that decrypts a string.

Once compiled the bytes inside the exec are:

- -----------------------------------
BB 03 01 B9 2E 00 80 37 FF 43 E2 FA
- -----------------------------------

The program is 487 bytes long.

I can only suppose that the virus uses a very similar decrypting routine, 
however I think there is something wrong in the way used by F-prot to search 
for new variants of Dir-II.

In fact F-prot still announces a possibly new version of Dir-II even if I 
create a only-12 bytes long file and fill it with those bytes above mentioned.

Of course a fake alarm is better than a true infection, but if my clients will 
use F-prot to scan their own hard disks I'll be ruined !  :-)

Subject: Re: Untouchable (PC)

  I agree with almost everything in Vesselin Bontchev's reply to Rick
Wirthlin on Untouchable.  However, there was one passage which re-
quires clarification:

>             There are about 17 ways a virus can infect a file, and the
> generic disinfector can handle about one third of them. The authors
> have promised to achieve about two thirds soon.

The number of infection methods now recognized by UT is between 10
and 14, depending on how one counts them.  (Like "number of known
viruses", it's not a well-defined concept.)

  Regardless of the exact number, there's a strong possibility that
Vesselin's first statement above will be misinterpreted by some
readers, who might think that being able to handle only "one third of
them" (i.e. of the *infection methods*) implies being able to
disinfect only one-third of the *viruses*.  In case anyone did get
this impression, the percentage of viruses which can be disinfected by
UT (as estimated by the authors, not according to the marketing hype)
is about 99% on the common viruses, and greater than 90% on other
viruses.

You don't recover, usually.  McAfee's Scan identifies a few of the
trojans that are ou there, including, for example, the Twelve Tricks 
trojan.  F-Prot identifies FAR more trojans, but these are virus scanners,
and not trojan scanners, so you shouldnt' be expecting them to.
 
A Trojan is pretty mcuh a program that does some unwanted action while you
think it's doing something good.  For example, if you ran some word
processor, and it started deleting your files, then you would be the
victim of a trojan.  
 
Many trojans use absolute sector writes, like the trojan you mentioned
because they're relatively easy to code, others make a mess of your
hard drive by making directories, files, or changing other file
related things.
 
I have seen two programs designed to create trojans, the VCL, which
generates some buggy code, and the trojan construction kit.  The trojan
kit is explicitly dangerous because you don't need a compiler for it,
and it comes with a time bomb faciltity, to change real programs into
time bombs.  The first version of this program is very buggy, but the
second seems to work well.  None of the anti-virus programs that I
have used detected anything from this program.
 
A long time ago I wrote a generic trojan scanner, TSCAN, which will
identify smoe trojans that use absolute sector writes.  The problem
with it is that a lot of programs do that, legitimately, like the
Norton Utilities, FORMAT.COM, and hard drive optimizers....  I am
working on another version which will provide far better results to
be released after my MtE detector.

    There was a product called Turbo Anti Virus (TNTVirus) produced by
a Carmel company in Israel. It was VERY similar to CPAV. Now that you
mentioned it, I must agree that CPAV was based on it. The original
program offered on-the-fly checksums, which it had previously appended
to the files to be checked. I would think they's include the company
name, i.e. "Carmel".

Subject: VSHIELD, VIRSTOP, ... comparison ? (PC)

I have found Robert Slade's quick comparison (and his longer reviews)
of several anti-viral programs very helpful; they prompted me to try
F-PROT and VIRx, in addition to the McAfee suite of programs which I
have been using for several years.

Is it possible that the three of you (McAfee, Frisk, and Slade) could
cooperate to produce a point-by-point comparison of VSHIELD and
VIRSTOP?

One of my questions is this: VSHIELD intercepts a keyboard reboot and
checks for the presence of an infected diskette in the boot diskette
drive; it does not allow booting from a (boot-sector?) infected
diskette.  Does VIRSTOP have this function?  What other differences
are there?

How can you tell if you have MS-DOS version 5.00a or not ?

I called Microsoft and requested the updated version for my computer

For one, I cannot live with imperfect detection. What I can live with
is 100% detection but a lesser identification (not wrong identification
but "this file has been changed"). An interesting case in point is
Vern Buerg's "LIST" which carries all of its data internally. One test I
use is to change a color or filter (going from wrap(W) to non-wrap (w)
changes bytes at offset 2Ah & 2Bh in version 6.1a) & see if anybody notices
- - some don't.

Seems like we should be about due for some "next generation" products,
products that can detect a one-byte change in any program but are smart
emough to know that a one byte change is not likely to be a virus.

Other expected "features" would be:

1) Multilevel validation - secondary programs that validate whether or not
   the protection program is working properly.

2) TSR awareness - what programs are expected to change memory allocations
   and which are not.

3) Interrupt path verification & recovery.

4) DOS locations, sizes, and expected values specific to the particular PC.

5) Ability to temporarily disengage certain functions for maintenance without
   having to remove the entire package.

6) Partitioning support.

7) Ability to detect an attempt to write to an executable

8) Novell/Pathworks/LAN Man/LAN Server/Vines support

The problem is that a platform independant management program is going to have
a hard time detecting platform-dependant low-level attacks. Consider
for a moment malicious software that tries to go resident in the disk buffers.
To work it must recognize the differences between buffers used by DOS 3.x
and those of higher versions. So must an integrity management routine.

Gene & Co. at Purdue are doing important work but it must be realized that
you cannot get all of the way with a platform-independant solution. A
long way certainly & would work on a PC with Jerusalem & Sunday, but how 
about a low-level infection such as MICHELANGELO or FORM ? These depend on
the platform.

Of course the real answer might be for a generic "kernel" with attachable
platform-specific modules that are assembled on installation. Not difficult,
just different.

I agree but take it one step further, again the algorithm should be
tailored to the specific machine and use a different seed on each - this
in no way weakens the algorithm but gives each PC a different signature
for a particular file. Break one machine and "malware" must start all over 
again on the next.

Most of these are just examples of "bypass DOS" since it is what is
slow or "stealthed" and are evident to anyone who fanatically studies the
architecture (admittedly not many do). Of course we all have our notebooks
like mine on DOS boot record requirements but I do not consider it secret,
just incomplete and not fully verified.

IMHO the real problem is that there are no standrds. What we are dealing
with is a multi-billion dollar garage industry that "just growed". Just
as a trivial example, no-one would buy a PC that isn't "100% compatable"
yet how many in the audience know *exactly* what that means ? (no
peeking). Is a PS/2 "100% Compatable" ? A Zenith 248 ? Careful now.

I postulate that every manufacturer has a different idea of just what
"100% compatable" is and that no-one really is (nor would they want to 
be), yet how many Anti-Virals are sold as "one size fits all" ? At
least some are starting to say DOS 3.x & higher and not 2.0 any more.

Of course open standards will require the giving up of some secrets
by the manufacturers, mostly those involving undocumented "back doors",
but these are not really secret any more and the manufacturers claims
(mostlt Microsoft's) of "if we document them, we'll have to support them".
Just do not ring true. All the documentation needs is a note that
"this function may be superceeded". But like an MtE detector, incomplete
documentation is worse than none at all.

Hmm.  That doesn't sound like the most brilliant thing.  It doesn't take
too long to search through memory, and it's easy for a varient to move
to a different place in memory.  Or pick a random spot.
 
And, yes, the problem is that CPAV does leave signatures in memory.  And,
it explicitly says NOT to use it with any other AV software.

Subject: Odd Virus? HELP (PC)

	Before backing up my hard drive last friday, I ran NAV to make
sure I wasn't going to make backup copies of any virus. NAV told me
that it had detected the Pakistani virus and another one called the
Brain virus. First of all, I thought the Pakistani virus was only a
floppy disk infector. Anyway, I exited NAV after the warning and tired
using NAV again as a second check, well, this time NAV comes up with
NO viruses on my hard drive. But when I checked my directory, I
noticed that some of my files(50-60%) had their dates changed to dates
ranging from 1955 to 1965. Can anyone help me out here??

Thanks!!

With me this happens only on HPFS partitioned volumes Anyway, they
have SCAN for os/2 (beta) and it seems to work fine with me. There is
just one problem - it hangs from time to time when you scan your
system volume, but they ensured me that this problem has been fixed
already though not released yet. (Let us hope it will happen soon.)

Subject: FC on virus creation

I am surprised that so many well respected Virus-L readers and writers
failed to understand the implication of creating 1500 viruses per day
that are not detected by existing scanners.  The point is that the
number or percentqge of viruses detected is not as important as the
eff of the product.

	Of the CARO collection of over 1500 viruses, only a small
portion have ever been found at a substantial number of sites, and
many are collector-only viruses that have never appeared in the wild.

	I am quite astounded by the concept that creating viruses in
the privacy of my home should offend anti-virus types.  In fact, I
have had automated virus generation systems running for several years.
At one point, I was trying to create ecosystems by randomly generating
tens of thousands of candidates per day, many of which were successful
viruses.  Why does this offend other researchers?  And I take it from
some of the comments that these researchers have NEVER created a virus
of their own to explore the concept!  It's sad that people who have
never tried it feel free to condemn it.  Or have they done it and
simply don't have the integrity to admit it?

	ASP has already introduced one virus-based commercial product
(which has never been detected as a virus by any scanner) which
operates quite well, and we are in the process of creating another
virus-based product designed to operate in LANs.  Our users don't seem
to be offended by the optimization of resource utilization, automated
distribution and installation, high reliability, and small space used
by our products based on viruses, but it seems to offend the
anti-virus community that all of their overblown claims about all
viruses being bad are being undercut by benevolent viruses that are
safe and reliable.  In fact, most of our viruses work on far more
systems than most virus defenses, and they don't spread where they are
not supposed to go.  They are easy to control and remove, they are
compatable with every DOS based system we have seen to date, and they
have never generated any unintended side-effects.  Kinda blows the
whole "all viruses are bad" thing, huh!

	NEW PRODUCT ANOUNCEMENT - BENEVOLENT VIRUSES IN LANS
	AUTOMATE MUCH OF LAN MANAGEMENT - ANTI-VIRUS COMMUNITY
	SHUDDERS - SCANNER PRODUCTS MUST ADAPT TO DIFFERENTIATE
	BETWEEN KNOWN GOOD VIRUSES AND VARIENTS CREATED BY BAD

C'mon now, Padgett: my own Virex-PC code has had this ability for
something like two years.  Heck, even Flu_Shot+ has had that since Day
One (well, since version 1.1, at least) which means that it's been
available for about four years by this time...

I think we can cut off your problem at the pass. Its a matter of the
greatest good for the greatest number. Most people do not ever need to
boot from the A drive, the exception being when their system crashes.
Since this is hopefully rare, having to go into the CMOS to change the
boot from C to A (which itself should be rare since the system is
supposed to be smart enough to know that it can't boot from the
crashed C drive) isn't that big a deal. Now there are certain people,
who for a variety of reasons, do need to boot from disk on a fairly
regular basis. From a security point of view the gate is already open.
Giving them a button to press (in the case of having a key based
override to boot from A instead of C) or just automatically booting
from A isn't really a big difference. Its the floppy itself that is
the problem. For the minority of the people who actually need to boot
from floppy, I would recomend they just set their system to boot from
A and make sure there aren't any disks in the disk drive that they
don't already know about.

Subject: A user's view of IBM's antivirus/2 (OS/2)

NOTE:The following review does NOT judge the virus detecting abilities
of antivirus/2. I do not have sufficent time and resources to do this
sort of testing. Hopefully Vessilin will do this as he is the only
source I would trust.

	A User's View of IBM's antivirus/2

This product is a big leap in the right direction, unfortunatly it
lept so far it fell over the edge. The program tries to make virus
detection and handling as painless as possible. It's features include
an automated checking utility that lets you set a daily, weekly,
monthly, one time, or only on bootup, setting to run a virus check.
The virus checker has a full range of options for choosing which files
to check. In addition the virus checker maintains an integredity
database, so you can choose to only check files which have been
altered. In addition, once your options are set, activating a virus
check manually is very easy. The virus program screen has a nice big
button in the middle marked "Check for viruses". In addition the
standard set up codes are good and when installed (a truly painless
process) the program will automatically do the first system check.

The manuals say that the program uses straight scanning, fuzzy
scanning (where codes simliar to the ones in the database are looked
for), Heurisitic Scanning (method is unspecified), and integrity
management. Exactly what information is recorded about a file is
unclear but I took my hex viewer and examined their database file.  It
has the names of all the files checked (which in my case is well over
3000) in an unencrypted and very orderly format, the information kept
on each file is only a couple bytes and I was able to determine that
it includes the file size. I don't know if it is using any sort of
checksum in addition to this, but whatever the file is recording its
very very orderly. This means that a directed attack should have an
EXCELLENT chance of working.

Besides the fact that the database file is unencrypted, another
complaint I have regarding the integrity management is that unlike my
favorite integrity manager, Integrity Master by Wolfgang Stiller, this
program does not list all files that have changed and how they have
changed. (On a related note, if Stiller had made an OS/2 version of
his program, I wouldn't have had to buy IBM's) I have a feeling the
reason this wasn't done was to make the program 'more friendly'.
However IBM shot itself in the foot. Right now when you run a virus
check you only get a message if something goes wrong, nothing else
shows up. Thats great! In addition, a file is created everytime you do
a check listing specifics of how the search was done and any
interesting things that might have happened (such as being unable to
open a file). This file is easy to reach from within the viral program
and only people who care need look at it. If IBM had just added a list
of changed files, I wouldn't be complaining.

In conclusion, IBM's AntiVirus/2 is the friendliest anti-viral program
I have seen. Its easy to install, set up, and use. But it's integrity
Management features leave alot to be desired.

Subject: Survey


I hope I'm not out of line by posting this questionnaire to this group
(I've already posted it to the Novell LISTSERV and have gotten a fair
number of responses back).  I am doing a study of computer viruses as
part of a Masters management project and as background for a proposal I
am developing for my employeer (the University of Maryland at College
Park).  I seek feedback from other organizations as to how they
perceive the threat from computer viruses and what, if anything, they
are doing about it.  I would appreciate it more than I can say if you
could take a few minutes to fill out the questionnaire and send it back
to me via e-mail (fax and snail mail are ok, too).  I hope to have the
results tallied by the end of the year.  I'd be delighted to share them
with you.  Simply attach a message so stating to your survey response.
Please respond to me directly, not to this list.

Thank you all very much, in advance

WHAT'S NEW

     Version 99 of the VIRUSCAN (SCAN, CLEAN, NETSCAN, VSHIELD, and
WSCAN) series of programs adds detection of 90 new viruses, bringing
the total to 865 viruses, or counting variants, 1561.

WSCAN has been updated to reflect the new /AD (scan all local drives)
switch added in VIRUSCAN.

VSHIELD has one new option added, the /CF {filename} switch.  When run
with this switch, VSHIELD will check files for unknown viruses using a
recovery & validation data file created by VIRUSCAN.  Thanks to Martin
Kiff for this suggestion.

CLEAN-UP has new disinfectors added for the Ontario, Tabulero,
Walkabout, Npox 2.0, and Npox 2.1 viruses, as well as a new
remover for the FORM virus.

The VIRUSCAN and NETSCAN programs are already available from this site
so they have not been sent a second time.  Version 98 was skipped
because  of a report of a Trojan horse from San Francisco, Calif.

VALIDATION DATA FOR THE VIRUSCAN V99 PROGRAMS

Following is the validation data for the various programs.  Please
remember that I send these programs directly to the WSMR-SIMTEL20.Army.Mil
and garbo.uwasa.fi sites directly by myself.  If you download the programs
from either site, or from any site that mirrors them, there is no need to
worry about tampering.
