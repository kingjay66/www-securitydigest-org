1.  Product Description:  Virus Prevention Plus is a commercial software
program to provide access control and virus protection for IBM PC or MS-DOS
compatible systems.  This product test addresses version 5.10.

2.  Product Acquisition:  The product is available from PC Guardian Security
Products, 118 Alto Street, San Rafael, CA 94901.  The account representative
who provided me an evaluation copy was Mr. Dan Marley, 1-800-288-8126.  Site
licenses are available.

4.  Product Test:

    a.  I received an evaluation copy of Virus Prevention Plus, version 5.10,
in June 1992.  The program arrived on one 5 1/4" high density disk with a 129
page Operators Manual.  The virus protection component of the product is
Fridrik Skulason's F-PROT (reference product evaluation, PT-17, revised
February 1992).

    b.  I tested the product on a Zenith 248, MS-DOS 3.30 and on a Gateway 2000
386/25, MS-DOS 5.0.  The minimum system requirement, according to the
documentation, is IBM or MS-DOS, version 3.3, 4.0, or 5.0 with 512K of free
memory.  The documentation does identify that certain hardware vendors, such as
Wyse, Zenith, Tandon and NEC, may modify DOS resulting in incompatibilities
with Virus Prevention Plus.  My testing on the Zenith system was only to
confirm this fact.  The test period extended from June 22 to July 15, 1992.

General Description:

The SWEEP program appears to be a very minor component of the package,
suggested only for use to check for existing viral programs before installing
the VACCINE change detection.  VACCINE provides the calculation of the check
value, but the detection of any changes is done by the DIAGNOSE program.  SU is
a utility program which allows examination and some manipulation of disk and
memory areas.

                  Comparison of features and specifications



User Friendliness

Installation

The Sophos VACCINE package is shipped on non-writable disks, both 5 1/4" and 3
1/2" low density media.

After having reviewed so many antiviral programs that demand you trust them
with your hard disk (Trust us!), it was refreshing to see that Sophos actually
suggests that you install the program onto a floppy disk!  Unfortunately, this
means nothing, as the installation program refuses to install the package
unless a hard disk is present.  In fact, none of the programs except SWEEP will
work on a floppy-only system.

The documentation does give detailed instructions for manual instruction.

As the SWEEP program is intended only as an initial check, nothing is said
about updating the program.  However, the documentation does warn that it "has
a limited useful life", and the program itself warns if it is more than four
months old.

Ease of use

Basic functions of the programs can be accessed reasonably easily.  However,
specification of some of the command line options and "lists" of items to check
would definitely be beyond the grasp of novice users, and likely beyond
intermediate users as well.

Help systems

Some "online" help systems are provided, but they do not provide much
assistance.

Compatibility



Company Stability

Sophos is a fairly major player in the system security field, in minicomputer
and communications systems as well as micro software.  It is also the publisher
of the "Virus Bulletin" periodical (and convener of that publications
conference).

Company Support

Only the address, phone and fax numbers are given: no mention is made of
support.  (If SWEEP detects a virus a message instructs the user to call Sophos
"for advice".)

It is noteworthy that my review copy arrived with a note saying that the
related D-Fence program would be dispatched "next week".  In spite of waiting
eight months before committing the review to paper, the program has never
arrived.

Documentation

There are five "manuals" shipped with the VACCINE package.  Four are packaged
together in a binder: the "Quick Start Manual", "VACCINE User Manual", "Using
VACCINE in a large organisation" and "Sophos Utilities User Manual".  The
fifth, "Data Security Reference Guide", is paperbound separately.

The user manuals are definitely technical reference level.  There is a great
deal of information regarding the use of the program for the experience user.
There is also information regarding the limitations of the program, or best
means of use, but this is often very brief, and one has to be almost looking
for it to find it.

The general description of viral programs is extremely limited.  Some of the
points are plainly incorrect.  For example, the description of viral programs
states that "[a]fter some time, all programs on the hard disk will be infected"
thus implying that all viral programs are file infectors, and then goes on to
list a number of viri, the first three of which are boot sector infectors.
Among the "rules" for avoiding viral programs are the same tired "avoid BBSes,
avoid shareware, buy commercial" themes.  The manual also appears to claim that
a change detection system can prevent damage by trojan horse programs and logic
bombs.

The "Data Security Reference Guide" appears to be a separate item.  The name
and separate binding would imply that this is a textbook for security issues.
Slightly more than half of the book (the last half) is a catalogue of the
security products Sophos sells.  The first part covers general security related
issues, such as choice of password.  Fully half of the pages in this first
section are devoted to a chapter on "Computer Viruses".  This chapter is an odd
mix of the magnificent (helpful diagrams of items ranging from boot sector viri
to write protect tabs) and the useless (BBSes are evil, commercial software is
good).  Overall the reference guide would be a helpful learning tool for
educating users about data security, but only with direction and additional
material.

Hardware Requirements

None of the programs, except SWEEP, will work on a floppy only system.

Performance

The documentation admits, albeit briefly and unwillingly, to the weaknesses of
change detection, and even specifically mentions that "stealth" type viral
programs will not be detected if the virus is active.  The ability to
"snapshot" areas of memory, the interrupt table and specific (system) areas of
the hard disk is a valuable plus.

The SWEEP programs functions quite well against common viral programs with the
exception that it tends to "find" more than one virus in an infected file (up
to eight in the case of a single "Jerusalem" infection).

Local Support

None provided.

Support Requirements

A novice user, installing this on a system after all other software had been
installed, would likely be provided with good protection against viral
programs.  However, it is likely that use of this product in any normal
business operation would require the support of personnel expert in computer
use as well as viral operation.

                                 General Notes

One would have to say that VACCINE is a product for the use of experts.  The
package seems to tacitly admit this with the additional section of the manual
for use in a large concern.  As a tool for serious support personnel, the
product does provide very significant utilities for protection of computer
systems.

Detect-only scanner with scheduling provisions.  Server-based within a network.

                  Comparison of features and specifications



User Friendliness

Installation

Shipped unprotected on writable media, both 720K and 360K disks.

The product received is identified as a "30 day test drive version".  This may
account for the fact that it doesn't work.

An installation program is provided.  There is no provision for manual
installation.  You must install with "SUPERVISOR" rights.  Therefore, you must
have an expendable Netware system to test this product.

Ease of use

The product uses the standard Novell menuing system interface, and should not
be difficult to use.  However, the product appears to have much the same
options as Novell security in general, and therefore a thorough grounding in
Novell security would seem to be a pre-requisite.

Help systems

None provided.

Compatibility

A special "Michelangelo" disinfector is provided.  The documentation for it
states that it will overlay an infected boot sector with a "standard" boot
sector.  This it does.  Bootable disks will thus become unbootable.  As it only
overlays the boot sector, it is ineffective against Michelangelo infections on
hard disks: likely a good thing.  You wouldn't want to lose your partition
table.

Company Stability

Intel?  Surely you jest.

Company Support

A number of options for communicating with Intel's NetDirect system are listed.

Registered users receive signature updates for a year.

Note that the "800" numbers for the US and Canada do, indeed, work from Canada.

As with everyone else, Intel received a copy of the initial evaluation for
their own review.  I received a telephone call from one of their service people
who asked about some of the points raised.  He seemed to be quite genuinely
interested in the points raised, and asked about other antiviral software that
addresses the shortcomings of the LANProtect product.  He also stated that the
"current" product is now 1.5, and that it does contain some disinfection
capability.

Documentation

The documentation is extremely short.  It gives directions on the invocation of
the program, and some of the options in terms of when to scan, who to report
the results to, and so forth.

There is a READ.ME file on disk which contains errata.  It also suggests that
"Detailed information on viruses can be obtained through a product such as:"
and then presents a promotional blurb for the Hoffman Virus Summary list.

Probably a good thing.  The "What is a Computer Virus" section is terse to the
point of being useless.  I'll bet you didn't know that a BSI could "spread via
the network cabling".  Or that a "TSR" virus "infect[s] all files as they are
run" (like DIR-II, perhaps?)  And, of course, we have the obligatory mention of
the modem as a source fo infection.

Hardware Requirements

Novell Network.

Performance

The manual lists endorsements from both Novell and the NCSA: the NCSA has
slightly more cautious wording.

Note that no disinfection capability is mentioned for this product.

Local Support

None provided.

Support Requirements

Likely requires thorough knowledge of Novell security provisions.

General Description:

VDS is change detection software with hard disk boot sequence protection
features.  VDSFSCAN is a scanner which appears to be merely an adjunct to the
change detection program.  The installation procedure is obviously concerned
with detecting and avoiding pre-existing viral infections, particularly of boot
sector viral programs.  VITALFIX is an MBR saving/repair program.


                  Comparison of features and specifications



User Friendliness

Installation

VDS was originally announced as shareware.  Disks were shipped to me from VDS
Advanced Research Group, along with a printed version of the documentation
which is shipped with the shareware archive.  I initially received a copy of
version 2.0, and later a copy of 2.1.  Along with the manual, but not bound in,
was a single sheet "VDS 2.10 Installation Guide".  Some references in this
document, and in the manual itself, seem to indicate that the normally
distributed shareware version does not have the full set of features of the
package, but these passages are unclear and open to other interpretations.  In
any case, I am not sure of which of the seemingly many possible "versions"
(trial, registered, complimentary, personal, academic, charity or business) I
have reviewed.  (In response to the initial draft of the review, I was told I
had received a registered version.)

Installation is a manual process.  That it cannot easily be fully automated is
obvious from the fact that the system must be "cold booted" at least twice
during the process.  The procedure is lengthy, but carefully explained.  There
are some points at which a familiarity with DOS would be of assistance in
understanding some options, but this should not present a problem to a
reasonably intelligent person.  The instructions in the manual are quite clear,
but the files presented on-screen at parts of the installation process are less
so.  At one point the user is directed to re-boot the computer: this, of
course, is not what is desired.  The instruction refers to the re-booting that
should have taken place earlier, but this may not be clear to a novice user.
Once the last part of the installation starts a windowed screen is presented.
There is little for the user to do at this point, so the reason for the
interface or display is unclear.

Certain parts of the installation instructions seem to indicate, to the
knowledgeable user, that the MBR is replaced: this is never confirmed.  There
is also no "uninstall" procedure listed.  At a later point in the
documentation, the possibility of saving, backing up or replacing the MBR with
the VITALFIX program *is* discussed, but there is still no confirmation or
denial of any modification during the installation process.  The VDS
documentation does state that the drivers installed remove themselves from
memory after checking, and this appears to be true.  Testing of installation
seems to indicate that no modification is made to the MBR.  (This was confirmed
in the response to the draft review.)

Installation should take about half an hour, or perhaps slightly less with
practice.  The last stage, that of "checksumming" each file, took eight minutes
on an XT with a 20 meg hard disk.  Installation must be done individually: a
driver is customized for each machine, and, presumably, drivers could only be
compatible if the BIOS, memory and disk partitioning is identical between
machines.

Ease of use

The VDS program presents a "windowed" interface, but there are, in fact, no
user options on it.  The only options are in the command line switches used on
invocation.  About the only useful options in the command line switches are
those for either more speed, or more thoroughness in verification.  Note that
if one wishes to use the "turbo" mode for initial checking at boot time the
command line switch must be manually added to the entry in the AUTOEXEC.BAT
file.

VDSFSCAN, on the other hand, does have menu options, but does not have any
command line switches listed in the documentation.  (In response to the draft
review, I was told that it does have command line switches; these can be listed
with the /? switch.)  Therefore, there is no possibility of, for example,
disabling memory checking, or speeding up the scanning process.

Help systems

None provided.  In fact, VDSFSCAN does tell you that help is available through
the F1 key: the F1 key does nothing perceptible.

(This is disputed by the developers.  F1 is supposed to provide "context
sensitive" help.  However, in testing it did not.)

Compatibility

VDS is incompatible with "disk expansion" software, and certain other similar
programs.  This is seen by the developers as unavoidable.

Company Stability

Unknown.

Company Support

For product support, only the postal address is given.  Although a phone number
is given in the documentation, it is specifically restricted to software orders
only.

Documentation

The original documentation for VDS 2.0 was very flippant, and resulted in a
very negative reaction to the product from some quarters.  In particular, the
version 2.0 documentation made very negative comments about other (unnamed)
antiviral products.  The version 2.1 documentation is more serious in tone, but
some passages are best understood in light of possible reaction to earlier
negative comment.  There are sections identified as "meant to be funny" and
some remarks that "sensitive individuals should skip this section".

The "VDS Risk Factor Analysis Test" is one of the sections that has been
criticized.  I feel this criticism is unwarranted.  The test, while not
perfect, does give a reasonable measure of risk, and has not been attempted
before at this level.

The documentation, overall, is best described as "patchy".  Although the
grammar is improving, and the tone is generally very readable, there is little
substantive material.  An initial reading left me wondering whether I had
missed some section explaining the use of the program.  While the manual
protests that the information cannot be revealed without jeopardizing the
security of the system, this seems to have been taken to extremes.  However,
there are nuggets of knowledge interspersed throughout the manual.

Hardware Requirements

MS-DOS 3.x or higher, must be installed on hard disk, and in specified
directory, cannot be used with "drive expansion" software.  None of the
programs, in fact, will run "uninstalled", and so they afford absolutely no
protection to "floppy only" systems, or LAN stations with no local hard drive.
One of the disk files seems to indicate that VDSFSCAN can be run on any system:
this is not true.  A possible alternate explanation is that it may work on some
of the drives that VDS is not normally compatible with.  However, since the
programs do not appear to work if not installed as directed, this would seem to
be moot.

(The developers protest this section, and say that VDSFSCAN will run not only
uninstalled, but will run on a "single floppy" system because the entire
program can be loaded into memory and other floppy disks can be scanned when
the program disk has been removed.  This is an advantage, and one which some
scanners lack.  However, my own observation is that VDSFSCAN will not run
unless it has been installed, but that it can then be copied to a floppy and
used on a floppy only system.  This still means that one must have a hard disk
to install the program onto, before it can be run on other systems.)

A "known clean" MS-DOS system disk with MS-DOS files is also required for the
installation process.

Performance

The initial verification at boot time adds two minutes to the boot process on
an XT with a 20 meg drive.  If the "turbo" switch is added manually, the
results are significantly faster.

VDSFSCAN is able to detect most common viral programs.  A fairly large number
in the test suite were missed, including all examples of Washburn programs
used.  A large number of those infections detected were misidentified.
However, as disinfection appears limited to erasure, this need not be a
problem.  (The "cure" option of VDS appears limited to system areas of the
disk.)  Scanning is definitely only a sidelight for this package.

Local Support

None provided.

Support Requirements

The package, while seemingly aimed at the novice user, still would require at
least an intermediate level knowledge of MS-DOS.  Even at that, a thorough
reading of the manual would seem to be in order.

                                 General Notes

The installation procedure for VDS appears to be directed at the novice user
who may already be infected with a virus.  The attempt is laudable, and may
provide additional security to the process.  However, certain aspects of the
implementation still require significant work.  The program is recommended for
intermediate users as having a strong detection component to add to other
antiviral measures.

Reaction to the draft review elicited the information that some of the problems
mentioned in the review are now being addressed, particularly that of being
able to schedule checking of the disk.  Mention was also made of plans to
release a commercial version of VDS.

General Description:

VIRHUNT is a non-resident scanner, change detector and disinfector (with
"generic" disinfection).  RESSCAN is a resident scanning program (with a
Windows compatible component WIN-RS and a network component, RS-NET).  VIRALERT
is an activity monitor (with a Windows component, WIN-VA).  ANTIGEN adds a
change detection module onto executable files, which can also disinfect unknown
viral programs which do not change original code, and can add password
protection to programs to prevent unauthorized use.  Two other (file viewing
and "Disk Killer" recovery) utilities are included.  Also notable is the fact
that the installation program will save copies of the CMOS and "boot records"
of the hard drive.

                  Comparison of features and specifications



User Friendliness

Installation

Data Physician Plus! is shipped on two writable and unprotected 360K diskettes.

(Each is clearly stamped with the serial number in very large, clear digits:
not always an easy item to find on any software.)

A "Quick Start" sheet, separate from the manual, suggests that you simply run
RESSCAN, and then use VIRHUNT if a virus is discovered.  (RESSCAN, by default,
does a full scan of the disk when invoked, and then remains resident.)

The manual is fairly imposing and technically oriented at first glance.  (It is
unbound, printed one side, and three-hole punched.)  Page 11 is the first
mention of installation, and suggests that you might wish to run the INSTALL
program in order to copy the files into whichever directory you choose.  It
also states that INSTALL gives a description of each program, but that you
should read the rest of the manual at some point anyway.

INSTALL is a "menued" program, but it is hard to say that it is very useful.
It does describe the programs, but does so in language that a novice would
likely not be comfortable with.  The description is not very long, but is
followed by the full list of command line options for the program.  Programs
are installed one at a time or "all" (you do not choose which ones you want and
then have them all installed at once) and is limited to not much more than a
copying function.  (ANTIGEN is not included in the installation options.)  It
is difficult, therefore, to understand the need for the installation program at
all.

INSTALL does have two interesting features.  One is the "Recovery" function,
which allows the CMOS and boot sector (and presumably the MBR, although this is
not explicitly stated) to be stored offline, and restored if necessary to
recover a "damaged" disk.  (This function is shared by VIRHUNT.)

The other is the ability to create "batch" files for running the various
programs.  A "fill in the blanks" form is presented, and a batch file is
created which will run the specified program with the specified options.  (The
F1 key is stated to give "information": this turns out to be simply the program
descriptions as above.)  A major deficiency in this function is that the
default filename for the batch files is always the same.  At first I thought
that this meant one batch file could be created in order to run all the
programs, but this is not so.  Each batch file overwrites the previous one: if
a filename exists the user is not warned that the previous file will be lost.
(With this in mind, the option to "pause" the batch file if a virus is found
becomes somewhat ridiculous.)  Do *NOT* use this on AUTOEXEC.BAT.  (After
installation of a program, there is a similar function to update AUTOEXEC.BAT.
It will install RESSCAN and RS-NET in AUTOEXEC.  It allows the user the option
to backup AUTOEXEC.BAT before changing it.)

Ease of use

The interface, while not overly difficult, is not particularly easy or
consistent.  A user familiar with a variety of interfaces will likely be able
to find out how it works by trial and error, but a novice may get stuck in
certain places.

A number of the options are difficult to figure out.  Partially this is simply
a matter of the complexity of a "useful" system.  (Data Physician has a large
number of options which could be helpful in a wide variety of situations.)
However, in a number of cases it is based upon poorly chosen wording or a lack
of information.  For example, ANTIGEN can not be used from a write protected
disk, even when it is protecting files on another, since it creates temporary
work files in its own area.  However, the error message is extremely terse and
gives no indication of the real problem.  As another example, once a list of
files for ANTIGEN to protect has been selected, the command to proceed is
"Quit".  Even having read the manual thoroughly, and after having gotten
VIRHUNT to create a signature file for change detection, it took me three runs,
by trial and error, to find the correct setting to have VIRHUNT use the
signature file to "generically remove" a new virus.

A number of option combinations give odd results.  For example, in order to use
the "generic disinfection", one must "turn off" virus checking.  However, if
virus checking is turned off while scanning to *create* the change detection
signature files, a file with no signatures is created.  (To make matters worse,
if you specify creation of the signature file, any previous file is overwritten
without warning.)

Help systems

Little provided.  A list of viral programs and their "characteristics" is
provided in VIRHUNT: it is extremely terse and of very little use.

Compatibility

Data Physician appears to be very compatible with a variety of hardware,
networks and Windows.

Company Stability

Digital Dispatch's antiviral programs have been on the market for many years,
although not widely publicized or marketed.  Other products by the company are
unknown.

Company Support

Nothing is mentioned about support, specifically, except that if you get a copy
of a new virus to DDI, they will get a fix out by the next day.  However, you
have to hunt around a bit in order to find the address and phone number.  (In
fact, the printed address only ever mentions the five digit Zip code.  The
"5+4" code is found in the "About DDI" section of the VIRHUNT program.)  In
suggesting that you send a copy of a virus to them mention is made of sending
it by modem: no BBS number is listed anywhere.

Documentation

The documentation is not necessarily poorly written, but is extremely technical
in nature.  Some of the early sections are a bit jarring in the sudden changes
of subject that go on.  As the technical reference sections appear, the writing
becomes more confident.  The type of document DDI is used to producing is very
obvious.  There is little general discussion of viral programs, nor of the
strengths and weaknesses of various portions of the program.

There is a substantial READ.ME file on the disk.  Also, the documentation for
the virus description language (for specifying newly found, or your "own",
viral programs) is almost entirely on the disk file CIL.DOC.

Hardware Requirements

At least one disk drive, 384K and MS-DOS 2.x or higher.  All of the programs
will run on a single floppy system.

Performance

Virus scanning is relatively slow, in comparison to other current products.
Most common viral programs are detected, but not all.  Identification of some
new viral programs which are similar to older ones is not particularly good.

Change detection is effective with VIRHUNT, as is the generic disinfection.
ANTIGEN however, is much less so.  On one test, it did not detect the presence
of an infection, although the "protective" code seemed to go through the
checking cycle twice.  (That test also allowed the infect of other files.)  In
another test, the infection was caught and successfully removed, but only after
infection of another file had occurred.  ANTIGEN was never able to stop the
infection operation, be it direct action or memory infection.

ANTIGEN will conflict with programs with internal loaders or non-standard
headers.

Local Support

None provided.

Support Requirements

It is unlikely that the novice user would be comfortable using the program at
all.  The intermediate user may be able to obtain some protection through the
use of the program, but is unlikely to be able to utilize it to the fullest
extent.  Advanced support personnel should be responsible for the installation
and configuration of the program.

                                 General Notes

This is definitely a program for the advanced technical user with a good
background in antiviral protection.  The package contains a number of
protective layers and options, and can perform in a great many situations.  The
configuration and command line options allow for many different kinds of
protection in different environments.

It is, however, not a product for the average user.  It can certainly be
installed on a novice's system by advanced technical support, and contains a
number of options for doing exactly that in a large corporate environment.  The
ability to specify notices to users in the event of infection and the
configuration files are two examples here.

The product would also be of use to the serious virus researcher supporting a
user population.  The CIL virus specification language is extremely detailed,
and much more effective, in this case, than simple string searching
capabilities of other scanners.

Recommended for the advanced technical user with advanced knowledge of computer
viral programs, in a large user population with centralized responsibility for
security.

1.  Product Description:  Citadel is a commercial access control and malicious
program detector/disinfector product for the Macintosh.  It also provides
additional utilities for encryption and for media sanitization.

2.  Product Acquisition:  Citadel is available from Microcom, Inc., P.O. Box
51489, Durham, NC 27717.  The telephone number is 919-490-1277.  The price from
the vendor has varied from between $50.00 to $99.00 depending upon special
promotions and upon whether a customer has already purchased other Microcom
products.  Site licenses are available.  There are also a variety of mail order
firms which offer significant savings on a single copy purchase.

4.  Product Test:

    a.  I obtained my copy directly from Microcom under a promotional offer for
those customers who had purchased other Microcom products.  I discovered that
Citadel includes a complete copy of Microcom's Virex program.  Virex provides
virus and trojan horse signature detection and disinfection as well as tools to
potentially detect "new" malicious" code.  Since I have previously evaluated
Virex under Product Test 10, revised February 1992, this review will forego any
additional analysis.  Product testing of Citadel occurred on a Mac IIcx, OS
6.0.5, and extended from June 1 through August 10, 1992.  The version tested
was 1.0 which is System 7 compatible.

Subject: Antivirus BBS list

Having culled all my resources, here is the first (semi) formal cut at a BBS
listing.  Waiting to receive corrections and additions.  Thanks to Bill Dirks,
Sara Gordon and Jon Freivald for some responses to my first "rough" cut.

The V.I.R.U.S./Virus Doctor BBS List

For sorting purposes the wide variety of bracket, slash, space and hyphen
placement have been removed from the phone numbers.  Apologies for the
difficulties this may cause with European numbers, but those familiar with the
areas should be able to sort them out.

In order to avoid line wrap on Fidonet mail readers, the "node number" has been
"right justified" at 75 columns.  For those on the Internet, it is possible to
send mail to these systems.  The node number is in the format
<zone>:<net>/<node> and can be converted to an Internet address as
user.name@f<node>.n<net>.z<zone>.fidonet.org so that Rob Slade may be reached
at The Cage (1:153/733, see "604") as Rob.Slade@f733.n153.z1.fidonet.org or at
Cardz as Rob.Slade@f7050.n153.z1.fidonet.org or at Deep Cove as
Robert.Slade@f915.n153.z1.fidonet.org

Key:

AM = Amiga          AT = Atari          MC = Macintosh          PC = MS-DOS
Fidonet echoes carried:  VIRINF = VIRUS_INFO   VIR = VIRUS   WRN = WARNINGS

In this initial draft of the listing the numbers have been collected from
sigblocks and taglines from messages on the three virus related Fidonet echoes
(discussion areas).  All BBSes listed in the CONTACTS.LST have also been
included.  Where verification is possible, the "node number" is followed by a
"V" and the initials of the reviewer.
