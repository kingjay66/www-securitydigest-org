Right now one of our students is testing version 97. The test is still
running, but what can be seen is that at least SOME of the infected
EXE files ARE detected. What can be also seen is that at least SOME of
the infected files (the spotted ones were COM files, but I don't have
the final results yet), are NOT detected. So, my warning remains:
don't rely on SCAN for 100% detection of the MtE-based viruses.

Could you please provide some more information. I had very strong
reports that Clean destroys the boot sectors of the 1.2 Mb diskettes
infected with Michelangelo, when it tries to disinfect them. However,
I was unable to reproduce the problem. I see from your message that
you have used indeed a 1.2 Mb diskette, so obviously you are observing
the same problem. Could you please repeat your experiments with a 360
Kb diskette (Michelangelo does not infect 720 Kb diskettes and damages
1.44 Mb diskettes)?

Not exactly. There is just a naming confusion between the names used
in SCAN and CLEAN.

Yes, they can be disinfected with the same routine, but it -must- be
able to make the difference between the two...

Oh, then I guess CLEAN is not actually disinfecting the disk, but just
overwrites the virus in the boot sector with a non-infected (but also
non-bootable) program... OK, I'll check that...

Subject: Password Program Preventing Boot (PC)

Doug: I *suspect* this is the same program I came across some time
      ago, if so try booting from a floppy with DOS 3.x instead of 
      DOS 5.0. If the boot works, then it probably is.

      In this case the easiest way to fix it is to use my FixMBR
      program (FixUtil3.Zip is on most archives) - the *real*
      MBR is probably in sector 2.

      Incidently, this same situation exists with a copy of an
      OS identifying itself as MS-DOS Version 6.0.0015 received from
      an unmentionable source.

      I tried to call this bug (with specifics down to the bytes
      in the MBR involved) to MicroSoft's attention but got the expected 
      respose ("the boot floppy is bad..." 8*( but I *did* try.

Well, there is indeed such a thing as the Terminator 2.  The name is derived
from an encrypted text string it contains:

            "Divide overflow The Terminator - 2 (C) 1992"

it is compressed with LZEXE 0.91, but to disguise it, the author has modified
it so that it does not contain the "LZ91" string at offset 28 (decimal) in
the file. (so if your file contains that, it is probably a false alarm).

I have not been able to make it replicate, but assuming it is a virus, I
added detection of it to F-PROT 2.05b (sorry about the delays in releasing
that version, folks - I made a major change to the scanner, and it is not
fully tested yet).

Well, there is one Oliver virus - a member of the Dark Avenger (Eddie)
family. 2136 bytes long, and not particularly interesting or widespread - just
one of the 90% of all viruses that fall into the "non-interesting" category.

Any decent scanner should be able to detect it - at least as a Dark Avenger
variant.

I'd be very interested if anyone knows anything about this!  We've had
some anxious calls.  The only connection I can think of is with the
completely fictional virus of that name done by the little-kid
computer-genius in the Outland comic strip awhile back.  But surely no
news organization would report something like that as fact!  *8) DC

Please note that the correct syntax for using CLEAN-UP (CLEAN.EXE) is

	CLEAN x: [virus i.d.]

Where "x:" is the letter of the drive to be cleaned, and "[virus i.d.]"
is the virus identification code supplied by VIRUSCAN (SCAN.EXE).  Failure
to provide the correct syntax for CLEAN-UP can result in erratic results.

Since the Michelangelo and the Stoned are rather similar in structure and
how they infect disks, the same algorithm is used to remove the virus (of
course, different parameters are fed in depending upon the variant and
size of the diskette infected--this is all handled internally by CLEAN-UP).

CLEAN-UP will run with any virus identification code you type in.  This
is why it is always a very good idea to run VIRUSCAN before running CLEAN-UP
(after booting from a known-to-be-virus-free DOS boot diskette, naturally) to 
confirm the virus infection and get the virus identification code to use with
CLEAN-UP.

Yes.

Can you please explain what you mean by "butchered"?  Did you try running
CLEAN-UP with the [GenB] virus I.D. code instead?  If so, what was reported?

>

CLEAN-UP Version 95 was released on August 14, Version 95-B on August 19, and
Version 95-C on August 20.  The current version of CLEAN-UP, Version 97, was
released on October 16, 1992.

>
>Below is the NDD report for each disinfection session.
<...rest of message deleted...>

It is still not clear to me under what conditions your tests of CLEAN-UP 
were performed, with respect to what options were used with CLEAN-UP, which
version of CLEAN-UP was employed, the capacity and status of the disks used,
etc.  Perhaps you could relate your experiences in more detail.

Hmm, I have something here that calls itself "the Oliver virus". It is
yet another Dark_Avenger hack. At first glance I didn't see any
activation date in it - I mean, it seems to trash the disk (via INT
26h) just every day... But I might be wrong.

It contains lots of childish and offensive messages. The first one is
"Bill the Cat Lives!" - in the very beginning, coresponding to "Eddie
lives...somewhere in time" in the original Dark_Avenger.1800.A virus.

Is this what you have?

The program (name available on request) that was installed had a 1992
copyright.  It took over the master boot record and scrambled the par-
tition table, among other things.

When the machine was booted from floppy disk, the boot WOULD NOT COMPLETE.
The machine would spin with the HD light on and do nothing.  When booted
from HD the password prompt  was issued.

We ended up booting from a network we had in-house and trashing the entire
HD to fix it (this wasn't a problem, since it was a student lab PC).  Fdisk,
format, etc. all couldn't fix it, we had to over-write the entire first few
sectors of the drive, then fdisk and format it.

You may ask "why not use the network in the first place ?"  This network
is obsolete, and has been replaced with new software that unfortunately
doesn't support network boot.

I agree; the thing comes with 8 samples, only half of which replicated on my
test machine.  I have seen a couple of viruses made in conjunction with the
VCL.  They are more robust than the original samples, but nothing new, really.

Probably, yes.  Of course, if that is the case you *might* be able to
remove it easily the same way as an MBR infection is removed - booting
from DOS 5 and running FDISK /MBR.  That will only work, however, if
the program does not tamper with the table itself.

If you think it is worth it, you might be able to get a card, which
write-protects the MBR.  This has the benefit of preventing infections
by certain viruses, such as Stoned.  I am not sure, however, if such
cards for IDE disks exist yet.

Well, here is what happened:

   I made a pretty big change to the program, in order to make it 
   stealth-virus proof.  That is, you caould run it, with a stealth
   virus in memory, and it would not be affected.

   As the method I used might cause some compatibility problems, I asked

   problems caused by the big change, however, but a lot of very small
   problems, such as if you scan a disk with a volume label containing a
   space in position 8, that space might vanish.

   Nothing critical, but some small things I like to fis.

   Anyhow, I think it is finished now, and when 2.05b is released it will
   be announced here, and uploaded to my usual sites (eugene.utmb.edu and
   oak.oakland.edu).

It *is* a hack; I've tested it before with no notable ill

Uh, maybe you have misunderstood me - I didn't expect it to

Stealth Bomber, I just expressed a doubt that it will be able to catch
such stealth tricks.

Another good sample to try is the Int13 virus - it is stealth down to
BIOS level, which means that even if you read the files with INT 13h
(thus bypassing the DOS file system), you won't be able to "see" the
virus.

My point is that if a stealth virus is in memory, and if it is
"stealth enough", no integrity checking program will be able to detect
it. There are several anti-stealth techniques that can be used, but
they either fail to work against advanced stealth viruses, or make the
integrity checker completely incompatible with anything that is not
plain DOS - things like LANs, compressed partitions, encrypted
partitions, Disk Manager partitions, etc.

The only safe way to run an integrity checker is either off-line,
after you have booted from the proverbial write-protected uninfected
system diskette (most of the current off-line checkers do that), or
after restoring the system state to a known clean level (the ASP
Integrity Toolkit does this and it is a resident integrity checker).

Since Stealth Bomber cannot rely on either of these two methods (it is
included in the application and is supposed to run after the virus
that has infected the application has been already executed), it has
no way to bypass advanced stealth viruses and to remain compatible.

Note that I am not saying that the package is bad. Just the opposite -
I am encouraging every program developer to use something like that.
It will help to stop at least the non-stealth viruses, which are still
the majority. The user just must be careful and not to develop a false
sense of security, since the package will NOT detect SOME viruses. But
better to have a limited protection than no protection at all.

You mean, "to SOME stealth viruses". It has no way to detect all of
them.

Depending on the definition of "virus-like", ALL DOS versions exhibit
virus-like symptoms... :-)

Uh, there is a silly Terminator virus of Russian origin. The version
of FindVirus that I have can find it, but Dr. Solomon often sends me
brand new versions of his scanner, which are not yet shipped to the
customers, so I don't know whether it will work for you...

Anyway, the virus that I mean is compressed with LZEXE, so it is very
likely that Gobbler has a not very good signature for it and is
causing a false positive. Do you observe any infections, i.e., does it
spread to other files, or is it only in one file?

Uh, what do you call exactly "1992 version of VIRSCAN"? If you mean
the IBM program VIRSCAN, it's latest version I am aware of is 2.2.3A
and it -can- detect Joshi. If you mean the program VIRUSCAN from
McAfee Associates (often referred to as just SCAN), then the latest
version is 97 and it also can detect Joshi. Or do you have some other
scanner in mind?

The file BOOT.DOS is created by OS/2, and is not found on the
installation disks.  It is a 512 byte image file of the DOS boot
sector as it was when you last told DOS to switch to booting OS/2
(i.e. by the command "C:\os2\system\boot /os2.")  If FORM was present
then, it will be found in the file, and FORM will be active in memory
when you next boot DOS.

What you could do is to boot from a clean DOS floppy and use DEBUG or
Norton's DISKEDIT to copy the boot sector from your clean floppy into
the file BOOT.DOS.  (You might need to do this under DOS, since OS/2
might not let Norton have low-level read access.  I'm not sure.)
After you copy the BOOT.DOS file, reboot from OS/2 on your HD and then
set up the computer to boot from DOS.  To be certain, you might want
to boot from a clean DOS floppy and then run F-prot to see if FORM is
present in the boot sector.

Good luck!

Yes, this can certainly happen.  When you issue the "BOOT" command, it
copies the current system boot sector into a file (named BOOT.DOS if
you're currently in DOS, or BOOT.OS2 if you're in OS2), then take
another file (BOOT.OS2 if you asked to boot OS2, and BOOT.DOS if you
asked to boot DOS) and writes that into the boot record.  Then it
reboots the machine.  So if you issue "BOOT DOS", then at some time
later boot from a FORM-infected diskette, then later issue "BOOT OS2",
the FORM boot sector (but not the other sector) will be in the
BOOT.DOS file.  If you later issue "BOOT DOS" again, the BOOT command
will re-install the BOOT.DOS file (including the virus), and reboot
the machine.  To clean this up, you need to get a valid BOOT.DOS file,
with a valid copy of the system boot record.  One way to do this is to
"BOOT DOS", then run an anti-virus program that can remove the virus
from the system boot record, then "BOOT OS2" again.  The resulting
BOOT.DOS file *should* contain a valid uninfected DOS system boot
record, put there by the anti-virus program.  Something like that...

And don't forget to re-install OS/2, so that it re-creates a new
BOOT.DOS, with a copy of the (now) clean boot sector. Otherwise, OS/2
will re-install the virus from the old BOOT.DOS (that contains the
image of the infected boot sector) the next time you tell it to boot
DOS...

Vesselin

P.S. All these dynamic changes of the boot sector and the startup
files will probably be a nightmare for the integrity checkers...
