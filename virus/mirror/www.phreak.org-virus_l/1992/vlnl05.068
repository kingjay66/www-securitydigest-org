VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  (The complete set of posting guidelines is available by
FTP on cert.sei.cmu.edu or upon request.)  Please sign submissions
with your real name.  Send contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU
(that's equivalent to VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).
Information on accessing anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue
archives is distributed periodically on the list.  Administrative mail
(comments, suggestions, and so forth) should be sent to me at:

                           BBS danger myth

I hear it from almost everyone I talk to about viri: "I'm in no
danger, I don't use a modem".

Yes, there are pirates, crackers and phreaks out there who frequent
bulletin board systems.  Yes, there are even pirates, crackers and
phreaks who run boards.  Yes, if you hang around even the best BBSes,
you will find lots of messages from ankies, techno-weenies and people
to who spelling and grammar are foreign concepts.

But bulletin board systems are not going to "automatically" infect
you.  Modems cannot infect you.  Reading messages cannot infect you
(albeit you might come across an ANSI bomb, but they can't "infect"
you).  Even downloading and running programs is not that dangerous.
(In nine years of working with the local and remote "on-line"
community I have not yet downloaded a single infected file, at least
not one that wasn't sent to me by another researcher.)

Bulletin boards are not the major "vector" in the spread of computer
viral infections.  I can even go a fair way to "proving" that
statement.  The most "successful" viral programs have always been boot
sector infectors.  From my experience and studies, there are more
copies of "Stoned" out there than all other viral programs combined.
And boot sector infectors are not spread over bulletin boards.  (I
said "are not".  I didn't say "can't".  Yes, you can use TELEDISK or
SENDDISK.  Yes, "droppers" are possible, and even known.  But droppers
are extremely rare, and most people don't even know what TELEDISK is.)
Thus, the major vector *must* be disk swapping.

Bulletin boards are not the enemy.  In the computer virus arena,
bulletin boards may be your greatest friend.  Where can you get
information about computer viral programs: from newspapers which state
that backups are all the protection you need against Michelangelo?
from magazines which state that you need to disconnect the hard drive
if you get an infection? from television stations which speak of BSIs
and show the screen produced by Cascade?  You read a lot of nonsense
on BBSes and networks about viri, but you get some information, too.
And the shareware programs are generally the best, cheapest and most
up to date.

After all, you can't even get DISKSECURE commercially.

                   Antiviral protection background

Having meandered around various academic and technical aspects of
viral programs for a while, it's probably now time to get down to
brass tacks and direct some attention at how the average user, or
office, can detect the presence of computer viral programs and deal
with them when detected.  In the coming weeks, I'll be laying out a
guideline blueprint that any user can follow, even without specialized
software.  I'll also be dealing with the various types of antiviral
software, and how to evaluate them.

First, though, a few strategies and attitudes to give you a better
chance of success in your defence.

Assume you are going to fail.

Or rather, not to be too fatalistic about it, *don't* assume you are
going to succeed.  Any program which claims that it will be able to
deal with all future viral programs is flat out lying, and the
software byways are littered with the corpses of those programs which
figured they knew it all.  Make redundant provision for checking and
don't trust any one antiviral program or system.  Keep testing it, and
keep up to date.

Which brings us to the second point: inform yourself and inform
others.  Not every computer user needs to read the VIRUS-L Digest (or
comp.virus on Usenet) or the Fidonet VIRUS_INFO, VIRUS and *WARNINGS*
echoes.  But every computer user should know of someone who does.  You
can't trust CNN for the latest virus bulletin: they still think the
NSA shut down Iraq's air defence with a printer.

By the same token, let the word out a bit more if *you* find out
something.  If you get hit, make sure you send a copy of the infection
to a researcher.  (It's terribly frustrating to try to deal with the
aftermath of a bad disinfection, when you don't have a copy of the
virus to work with.  "Oh, we just reformatted the drive ...")  If you
get hit, admit it.  Don't imagine that you can ignore it and it will
go away.  (We are continually asked how bad the problem is ... by the
same people who will not answer surveys so that we can find out how
bad the problem is.)  This last is a bit of a touchy issue with those
who feel that we should not say anything for fear of giving virus
writers ideas.  Never fear.  Virus writers don't need any help.  "The
Cuckoo's Egg" proves that the only result of keeping information to
yourself is that the people who really *need* the data won't have it.

920302   PRTCKL1.CVP

                    Antiviral checklist - part 1

The next several columns are going to outline, and explain, a
checklist of steps that any computer user can take to reduce the risk
of computer viral program infection, and increase the chances of
detecting an infection early -- hopefully before it has much chance to
do any damage.

The points will be presented with an explanation of each item, and
therefore the whole checklist will not be complete until this set of
columns is finished.  To begin:

                         For each computer:

I really feel that the following list is reasonable, achievable and
necessary for each individual computer.  All of the items, with one
exception, can be obtained by any intermediate user with only the
software supplied with the computer.  Most of the items should be done
in any case as they are good "technical support" practice.

_ Directory list of all program files, date and size

This, of course, is completely straightforward, and yet it is so
seldom done.  Yet the vast majority of file infecting viri would be
instantly detected by a comparison between the original "clean" list
and a directory listing taken after an infection.  For best results,
of course, other factors are needed, which will be covered in due
course.

_ List of programs run at startup

With the number of "background" and "resident" programs running on
computers today, it's a wonder *anything* can operate at all.  If you
don't know what your computer is supposed to be running, how on earth
do you know when something unusual creeps in?

For the MSDOS world, this list can be obtained simply by printing a
copy of the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.  It may be felt that,
because these files are present on the computer anyway, it is
redundant to print them out.  A fair point, but a booklet of this
information at each computer will save time and trouble all round.

_ "Source code" for menus

These days the computer vendor/reseller or a technical support person
installs the computer hardware and software, and then installs a
simple menuing system for the user.  It is not always obvious, from
the disk structure, which program the user may be using on a regular
basis.

                    Antiviral checklist - part 2

                         For each computer: (con't)

Last week's checklist items were, I am sure, unchallenged by anyone.
They were things that the most naive user could find, and that any
reasonably intelligent person could understand.  The following may not
be as readily accepted.  However, I stand by them as items which every
computer should have.  In fact, they may be even more important than
the forgoing.

_ Description of boot sector

By a description I mean something as simple as a copy on a separate
diskette or a "hex dump" listing.  But even this is a formidable
object for a novice user to understand, let alone produce.

This, however, is not an insurmountable objection.  The user does
*not* have to understand what the listing means, only that a change
occurs.  As for generating the listing, that can be done by the
qualified people who install the system.  With DEBUG on the system,
batch files can be written to show the user the first few lines of the
current boot sector.  It might also be a good idea to have printouts
(of the most common) and batch files to check the boot sectors of
floppy disks.

_ Description of partition boot record

Similar objections will be raised, and similar arguments defeat them.
With the prevalence of Stoned and Michelangelo, the master/partition
record is even more important than the boot sector.  For MS-DOS
machines, FixMBR allows capture, and F-PBR from the 1.xx versions of
F-PROT allows examination, of the relevant sector.  (FixMBR, by the
way, should be a part of any BIOS DOS, and all users should be part of
a massive letter writing campaign to Microsoft and Digital Research,
demanding to know why the twits haven't licensed it yet.)

_ Description of memory map at startup
_ Description of interrupts at startup

These two can really be handled together, both in concept and in
execution.  Again, while the novice user can't be expected to know
what all the numbers mean, anyone of sound mind can see whether or not
they change.  The one problem here is that, during the normal running
of programs, some of these numbers do change.  Therefore, it should be
stressed that, if any change is noted, it should be checked again
after a "reboot" of the system.  At this point some of the benefit is
lost, as the novice user may not be able to differentiate between a
valid program which is sloppy in its use of memory, and a viral
infection.  Having this item on the checklist, however, will give the
experienced support person an immediate baseline.

                         For each computer: (con't)

>From the esoteric, we move back into the mundane, and some
uncontroversial measures.

_ Backup "originals" of software

As we progress through the list, it will be noted that a number of the
measures proposed are no more than those proposed for good computer
management and support without regard to viral programs.  This should
not be surprising.  The operations of viral programs are not different
in kind from normal computer operations.  (This is why it is
impossible to identify a viral, as opposed to a valid, program by
examination of the code alone.)  Therefore, any operation of a viral
program could just as easily be done by the proverbial "ingenious
idiot" who has historically been far more deadly than any kind of
malware.

As will be noted in future columns, I recommend that all software be
installed from "backup originals".  These disks, or copies made after
installation, should there be any customization involved, should be
kept with the computer.  This serves two purposes.  It allows for
quick access to "known clean" software for re-installation, if
necessary.  (These "originals" may reduce or eliminate the need for
"full" backups of the system, as the software is often the larger
portion of material on the user's disk, and generally the most
stable.)  It also provides a "baseline" for a quick check for any
changes to the software.

_ Backup of hard disk directory structure

Backups are a part of good procedure (and are a part of this
checklist, further on, as well).  However, while provisions are more
often made for the programs and data to be backed up, the directory
structure itself is often forgotten.  Rebuilding the directory
structure may, in fact, be the most time consuming part of a recovery.

Keeping a copy of the directory may help in other ways.  Some malware,
the "AIDS Information" trojan being a notable example, build extra
directories in order to escape detection.  Having a baseline copy of
the valid directories gives one another means of detecting viral
programs, rather than another place for them to hide.

                    Antiviral checklist - part 4

                          For each office:

"Each computer" is pretty easy to define.  An office is less so.

For the purposes of this checklist, an office is defined as a group of
people who interact on a regular basis.  "Regular", for this purpose,
need be no more than once per week.

An office is, therefore, defined less in terms of locale and walls
than in terms of communication.  For this definition an office may
consist more of those working on a common project in far-flung cities
than of those in the next cubicle whom we never speak to.  However, it
need not follow "official" reporting lines either.  An office is
defined more in terms of how fast you can find information when you
need it.  The items in this next section of the checklist are those
which may not be referred to for long periods of time while things are
going well, but which may need to be found quickly once an anomaly has
been identified.

_ Description of current common viri

This may be a prepared list, or it may be maintained in the office.
For all systems, the major prepared list must be the Virus Catalog
prepared by CARO/EICAR.  This list is not complete, but it does cover
all platforms and the most widely distributed viri.

In the MS-DOS world, another possible source is the shareware summary
list collated by Patricia Hoffman.  While this list is more complete
in covering the 1200 (1300? 1500? by the time you read this, who
knows?) MS-DOS viri, it is, of necessity, less accurate at times.

Antiviral software, especially that which incorporates scanning, often
includes listings of viri, their symptoms and features.  Some of these
are good, some less so.

All of these lists must be kept up to date, and it is probably an idea
to have someone within the organization who is supporting the prepared
lists with additional information from sources such as VIRUS-L.

                    Antiviral checklist - part 5

                          For each office: (cont.)

_ List of local virus information contacts

Who ya gonna call?

This is a very difficult section to advise on.  For my part, I can
think of perhaps twenty people in the world of whom I could state,
with confidence, that they were competent in the field.  This is not
to say that there are not more, but it is an esoteric field, with few
standards to judge by.

The information is hard to come by, for one thing.  The popular, and
even the technology trade media, has very little appreciation for the
difficulties and traps of virus hunting.  The recent experience with
Michelangelo points this out sharply.  Almost all the articles in
advance of the March 6 date stressed that the virus could be defeated
by making backups or resetting the date.  None mentioned that a BSI
could corrupt non-standard disk formats used by many backup programs,
and none pointed out the difference between the "DOS" date and the
"system" or "clock" date.

Virus "experts", in common with most system level hackers, tend to be
charter members of "Egos-R-Us".  This is bad enough.  However, what is
worse is that everyone with an outdated copy of SCAN thinks he or she
is a virus expert, and assumes the arrogance without necessarily
having the expertise to back it up.  (Given that the general
population, even of advanced computer users, has very little
background in the subject, the problem of proving credentials is often
moot.)

So, how can you find a local expert?  Some indications:

         Points for:
    - is a "member" of VIRUS-L, and has been for a least a year
    - if no Internet access, reads all three Fidonet echoes
    - is a contributing member

         Points against:
    - "one antiviral fits all"
    - boasts of the size of his/her virus collection
    - warns against BBSes and online services
    - recently joined the net and immediately flamed the
moderator  :-)
