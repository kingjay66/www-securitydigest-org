Subject: Macintosh virus rumors (Mac)

Over the weekend, numerous reports of a potential new Macintosh virus,
(tentatively) named "Aliens 4" have been floating around the networks.
After speaking with the originator of the report and having received
numerous (5 and counting, so far) cross-postings of the preliminary
reports, I would like to stress the need for calm, rational response
to this problem.  A couple of critical facts:

o The virus, if indeed it is a virus, has not yet been isolated and
  analyzed.
o As such, the preliminary reports were based on rough, empirical
  observations, and may well be incorrect and/or incomplete.  At the
  very least, these preliminary reports are not sufficient to
  disinfect any systems.

I am sure that we (as a community) are all grateful for the work that
is being done to isolate and analyze this virus, but until more
information is known about it, we must be careful to not jump to
conclusions, since this only serves to promote panic.

Everything posted about the virus until it has been properly analyzed
is strictly conjecture.  For this reason, I will NOT be re-posting any
of the preliminary bulletins to VIRUS-L/comp.virus until the virus has
been analyzed.

Calmly,

Ken

Yep - I see something -quite- similar to this all the time.  Compare:

Phils MBR:        EA 05 00 C0 07 E9 99 00 02 6F 79 00 F0 E4 00 80
My diskette:      EA 05 00 C0 07 E9 99 00 00 1A 03 00 C8 E4 00 80

My diskette happened to be the first sample of a Stoned infected
diskette I could lay my hands on.  The first difference between these
two is at offset 8 - this is the byte Stoned uses to decide whether it
is booting from a floppy - 00h - or a HD - 02h.  Without digging out the
rest of my disassembly notes (which are at home), I can't clearly
comment on the significance of the other differences.

You may have a new Stoned-based boot sector infector or a disk which has
been "innoculated" against Stoned.  I find the latter less likely, as
it's only necessary to have the first four bytes of the MBR match Stoned
to fool its infection check (for what it's worth, such "inoculations"
are not a good idea).

If it's a virus, save a copy of the MBR to a disk file and only
give/send copies to reputable anti-virus researchers like Frisk, McAfee,
the VTC in Hamburg, etc.  Look through the first few physical sectors of
the HD.  You should (?) find a copy of the original MBR stashed away
somewhere.  The failure to boot may be because the virus isn't correctly
locating/loading/executing the original MBR, or may be due to corruption
of the original MBR.  If you find an apparently OK copy of the original
MBR, copy it back to absolute sector 0,0,1.  If you have DOS 5.0 and the
viral MBR still has a good intact partition table (booting from a floppy
allows you normal access to your HD), you can, instead, use the
undocumented:

      FDISK /MBR

to re-write the MBR's bootstrap code.  Corruption of the original MBR is
common with Stoned and related viruses on HD's that were partitioned
with pre-DOS 3.0 versions of FDISK, as it did not reserve all of the
first track for the MBR; thus Stoned overwrites part of the FAT when
stashing away its "safe" copy of the original MBR on such machines.
(That's fairly garbled - if you don't understand some of it or for more
detailed help, mail me.)

Four things:

1.  Frisk very recently said that this version, maybe renamed to 2.05,
might be released RSN.

2.  Was that really the filename?  Kind of a giveaway if it was.  8-)

3.  Why do large ftp sites use inadequate OS's, ftp implementations or
whatever?  Upload directories should be able to be made "write-only"
so the "world-at-large" can't do silly things through them, like "dir"
and "get".  One of the hacked, so-called PKZIP 2.x's was widely spread
from ftp sites' upload dirs.

4.  Why do people make -posts- like Douglas's when something like this
happens?  You don't have to look far through the digests/newsgroup to
find Frisk's Email address - indeed, you don't have to look far in the
F-PROT package for the same info.  Think about the process people - if
Frisk announces a new version and it's not already uploaded he and the
site moderator will be inundataed with messages saying "Where's it
gone?", "I couldn't find it", etc, etc.  It takes a finite amount of
time from upload to inform the moderator to having it moved to its
final resting place, and it had just been uploaded.  If this is a
trojan, Douglas has just told the world that 2.04c is "out" - the
implicit warning that he hasn't seen a release announcement will be
ignored by a disconcertingly large number of users (they will want to
be the first to d/l it from an ftp site and u/l to their favourite BBS
so they get the kudos of being up with the play - and the u/l
credits). Better he had shut up in public and talked with Frisk in
private, letting Frisk make the appropriate decisions regarding
warning the ftp site moderators, etc, etc.  Don't give me any horse
puckey responses about "freedom of speech" and "the public's right to
know", either.

Subject: windows multitasking and viruses (PC)

I've just read Padgetts comments on the need for scanners to be
reloadable when running with netware, windows etc. My immediate
response is YES! he's absolutely right. In fact I recently emailed
FRISK on the topic of Netware and Virstop, and was pleased to see in
his mailing in this bulletin to the effect that Windows support should
be coming soon. We are making increasing use of both Netware and
Windows, and the problems described by Padgett are very real. In some
areas we can overcome our main problem, boot sector viruses, by remote
booting, but this option is not suitable in all cases, and doesn't
help with file infectors. The frustrating thing is that products like
NAV and CPAV which provide Windows support ( and NAV seems to cope
with a Netware connection) have such mediocre tsr scanners as to be
practically useless. (Yesterday my evaluation copy of CPAV allowed a
Campana/telecom-boot infection to go ahead).

The easiest way would be to scan when you know you won't use the computer

Subject: help, high weirdness (PC)

Hi, I've been having strange hassles with my machine lately, symptoms
include;
1)  Inability to boot from a floppy.  It boots from c: always, no error
message if I leave a non-bootable floppy in there, and no booting from
a bootable.
2)  Keyboard spaceyness, it gets to thinking that the shift is down, so
even numbers show up as @#$%^, and the alt ,and ctrl keys don't quite
do what I expect them to (usually happens in WP5.1)
3)  My default settings in WP5.1 just reset, my Canadian WP expects US
lexicon, and other things reset to original.
4) QEMM sent me this error twice when loading F-PROT (or was it
VIRSTOP?)

EXCEPTION 13 @ 29FF:0000  ERROR CODE 0000

INSTRUCTION: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

5)  VSHEILD sent me this once

VSHEILD 4.9V93
Sorry an impossible internal error occurred
Error code is 8522

6) F-PROT 2.04b and Scan 93 find nothing, although vshield found an
[emp] on a floppy and f-prot concurred, but I think I got that one
before it had a chance to do anything.  F-prot heuristic search
reports that the shareware utility Directory control DC106f.zip
searches for executables.

Problems 4 & 5 occurred without any changes to the programs or
autoexec.bat files, and dissapeared without any changes.

Is it viral? ( He asks the impossible to answer question )
thanks for any help or advice.

Look for the program WCRON, which lets you schedule programs to be run
under MS Windows. I think it came out in comp.binaries.ibm.pc in
volume 15, and it is on at least wuarchive for anonymous ftp in
/mirrors2/win3/util.

Of course, the problem is to get a decent scan when running under
windows, since there are some restrictions on raw disk accesses and
what happens to the warning message if it does find a problem, but (I
think) you should do fairly well with other programs in the Vshield
family.

I think there's still room for an automatic virus scanner/change
detector that runs "in the background" - even as part of a screen
saver? Anyone got one of those?? As the complexity of virus detectors
increases (to cope with lots of new and sophisticated viruses) I
suspect that scan-as-you-load programs will have to go, while
change-detect-as-you-load (or as part of disk compressiuon schemes, as
padgett suggested), and scan-as-you-write-to-disk or scan-when-idle
systems will be more popular.

Thanks for the answer.

I scanned also data files, with the same results. You and Aryeh
Goretsky from McAfee both suggested that a virus leftover must be in
an unused portion of the disk. I scanned my disk with some antivirus
program which supports scanning the whole disk, not just files (I
forgot which program, I think it was tbscan or htscan). It reported 2
4096 infections on an unused portion of the disk, which supports your
suspicion.

I tryed using a disk optimizer like Aryeh Goretsky suggested, but it
didn't help.  Does anyone know of a program to clear every unused
portion of the disk (i.e.  parts of sectors after eof, and totally
unused sectors)? Of course I can backup the whole hard disk, format
it, and restore the files back, but that would be a very long job.

Such a program might be an interest to other people too, since I don't
suppose I am the only one suffering from this phenomena. Writing such
a program should be trivial for people with knowledge how to directly
access disk sectors, like disk optimizer writers, which,
unfortunately, I'm not one of.

Three days ago I downloaded F-Prot 2.04c (fp-204c.zip) from the net.

The 'Program - Performance' info in the interactive shell boosts a
much higher number of viruses and virus-families to be detected than
under version 2.04a.  The documentation, however, does *not* mention
any advances/extensions/...  (The documentation files seem to be
nearly unchanged since 2.04a)

So I wonder, what really has changed and what the newly detected
viruses are!  Does anyone know?

Thanks,

Sorry, but your recollection is not too accurate.  I never used the
term "anti-semitic" in anything I ever wrote on viruses, and I never
complained about the Jerusalem virus being called the "Israeli" virus.
(Quite the opposite!  I even submitted a report on the virus in
_Computers & Security_, entitled "The Israeli PC Virus".)  The only
complaint I made concerning its name was against calling it the "PLO"
virus, and this not because of anti-semitism, but simply because there
was never the slightest shred of evidence for the PLO's having a hand
in it.  The whole story about "terrorist" authorship was apparently
invented by a journalist in the NY Times of 31 Jan 1988, and his
reason for advancing that hypothesis was nothing more than the
coincidence of dates (as I determined through personal correspondence
with him).

Hmm, on the other hand, since June 92 we now have the Palestinian
virus (the author calls it the "M.S Jurusalem Virus" and claims to be
a "Palestinian Boy").  For those unfamiliar with this virus, it's a
non-resident virus which prepends 15392 bytes to COM/EXE files, writ-
ten in Pascal.  It displays a political message, but claims "to avoide
making any damage to your files" (this is apparently not always true).

Subject: "Viruses Get the Boot", Information Week 10 Aug. pg 15 (PC)

Once again the old "Hardware vs Software" question arises (as  an
aside, I *suspect* that the patent referred to in the article  is
the same one that I examined a couple of years ago. It *might* be
effective against some viruses but the description was too  vague
totell).

Just  to clear the air, IMHO the only hardware needed to  prevent
viruses  is BIOS ability to select the primary boot disk  as  the
hard  drive instead of a floppy. *Everything* else necessary  can
be done as well by software.

Further,  for  the  paranoid, MFM, RLL, and SCSI  drives  can  be
hardware  write  protected  either at the controller  or  with  a
physical device on the cable connecting drive and controller (IDE
is more difficult) - but nowhere else.

While  hardware on the bus or attached to a port *could*  prevent
or  at least detect the majority of the known viruses, they  will
fail  a  directed  attack by a  professional  (or  professionally
written viruses).

Why ? Because the PC architecture is a single-state machine. Even
though  there  is  a  "protected" mode, what  can  be  done  with
software  can be undone with software and the only  link  between
ANY  hardware  device on the bus (or a port) that  does  not  use
dedicated cabling is software.

So  far  I  have  only seen one  true  disk  hardware  device  as
described above. It had a separate hardware control panel and  an
internal  board.  While  it  was "on"  the  bus  (for  power  and
reporting only, software commands would not be accepted), it also
physically  separated the disk cable between the  controller  and
the drive. This will work so long as a virus does not get  "help"
from the user.

ANY other hardware device that relies on software for control  is
subvertable  by  software. Period. Of course there  is  no  virus
known  today  that  could do this, but to  me,  the  question  is
*could* it be done.

Consider a BIOS extension (the only major change made to the  IBM
BIOS description since the PC was introduced). After POST  (power
on  self test), the BIOS scans the region from segment  C000h  to
EE00h  for a BIOS extension signature indicating that a  hardware
device with on-board ROM is present. Early PC users will remember
the  first  drive controllers loaded at segment C800h  and  using
DEBUG  to  G C800:5 for a low level format using  the  controller
ROM.

Such extensions work invisibly by redirecting one or more of  the
BIOS interrupts (contained in the Interrupt table at location 0:0
in RAM) from the BIOS to their own ROM code. A hardware antivirus
device  would have to work in the same way (for a  more  complete
description,  refer to either the Phoenix BIOS book for  the  PC-
XT/AT or one of the early IBM PC Hardware Manuals).

A directed attack could simply patch the Interrupts back and  the
hardware  device would be bypassed - the only hard part would  be
finding the real interrupt vector but several mechanisms (such as
tunneling) could be used for this.

Consequently,  IMHO,  against  a  directed  attack,  a   hardware
solution other than as outlined above (e.g. anything that  claims
to work on "any PC" or "on any port" or "just by inserting in any
available  slot")  would  need a lot of  explaining.  Again  IMHO
software could be just as (in)secure without using a slot or port
or dedicated upper memory (today, the address area from C000h  to
FFFFh  is just as valuable as the "lower 640") and I have yet  to
see hardware that could be sold as inexpensively as software.

The  bottom  line ? The IBM-PC, for all of its 486/66  power  and
gigabyte hard disks, etc. etc. etc. Has had no real architectural
changes since Oct. 27, 1982. It was not designed to be multi-user
or  to have any integrity management. It will happily attempt  to
execute  *anything*  it is told to. This is what makes a  PC  (or
clone  or...) 100% compatible and the streets are  littered  with
"PC"s that thought they could be different.

Anti-virus  software that succeeds does so by making the  minimum
intrusion on the system (why Scanners are so popular -  integrity
management  programs are *much* more difficult to write - my  MBR
routines  were  hard  enough, replacement DBRs are  an  order  of
magnitude  more  difficult  &  it is  incredible  just  how  many
different  & conflicting OSs there are).  Hardware,  particularly
pure hardware that claims to stop "any" virus, would be unlikely.

Warmly,

Yeah, but "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" was the movie that made
him an international singing star!  NOT!

BTW, the "Baker & Byrd" morning show [WASH-AM radio] used to include a
character called "Clint" that was a dead-ringer.  "Clint" used to end
every other sentence with "punk!" and interact violently with other
characters.  Mr. Eastwood's lawyers "suggested" that they stop doing
"Clint", so he's been replaced with "Sean", a rough-hewn, balding
actor with a definite Scotish brogue.  (Mr. Connery's lawyers haven't
found out about "Sean".  Yet!)
