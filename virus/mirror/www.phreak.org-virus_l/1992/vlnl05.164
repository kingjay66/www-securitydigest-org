Alas, it is still seen as infected with Flip by other scanners :(

Use a phisical disk editor to inspect track 0, side 0, sector 7.
Stoned virus usually copies the original MBR to that sector.  If it
seems like the original MBR, just copy it over the infected MBR at
cylinder 0, side 0, sector 1 and reboot the system.

     Rudy.

Subject: Terminator 2 and Gobler (PC)

Hi

One of our students came in the other day, reporting a virus that our
scanner didn't pick up on (Solomons' Guard - Memory resident). This
was Terminator 2, and it had been reported by a piece of software
called 'Gobler' or something similar.

Now, none of the virus stuff that either myself or a friend working
for British Gas (where the student claims he got the virus) has a
record of this virus. They all mention Terminator, but not Terminator
2.

Does anyone have any knowledge of either this virus, or of the
validity of the report? Both myself and my friend would be most
interested as between us we are responsible for the virus-free state
of almost 1500 PCs.

Thanks in advance,

Rob

I remember hearing of C code that you could add to your program that

Subject: New PC Trojan in Superpower game (PC)

One of my co-workers runs a BBS in Pittsboro NC.  They got hit by a
trojan that was embedded in a game called "superpower".  The zip file
purports to be a game for bbs sytems (such as WWIV, TBBS, RA, etc) but
when unzipped it shows several secondary zips, which when uncompressed
and run even with scanning, trashes the boot block, partition table,
FAT and Root directory of the disk it was running from.  Post-mortem
examination of the drive with Norton showed the basic information in
the disk information window and the partition tables as being replaced
with "Your disk is screwed, that's what you get for running
superpower" (one word in each field down the display.)

The original zip file was disposed of before the damage was done, and
the actual source of the trojan was not on a local area BBS.  Best
reflections point to a possible origin in Pennsylvania.

The game was run under Windows, but the disk was trashed anyway.

The drive had to be low level formatted to restore proper operation.

The victim in this case was eddie@cds.duke.edu.

Subject: Windows 3.1 virus detection (PC)

Having been forcably converted from DesqView (and DVX) to Windows,
some sandbox time was spent over the weekend with surprising results.

One of the discoveries was a way to induce DOS to run a .BAT file on
opening a MS-DOS Window (blue screen, set proper PATH & SET variables,
open in pre-windows directory, set special PROMPT, etc.) but that
doesn't have anything to do with viruses 8*)

The interesting fact was that with the addition of a 200 Mb drive to
my personal machine I no longer had to use a compressed drive on that
PC permitting the fast(er) 32bit disk access possible with Windows 3.1
- - quite a speed improvement but also a shock:

The first time Windows loaded after being told, a black screen
appeared notifying me that Windows could not use the 32bit access
since "something" possibly a <shudder> VIRUS was present. This turned
out to be my DISKSECURE program which traps Int 13 during BIOS load,
but means that nearly all MBR and BSI infectors (as well as anything
else that traps Int 13) will probably trigger the same screen if
loaded after Windows 3.1.

Of course, if such programs are present before Windows is installed,
then it will not select 32 bit as evidenced by the line
"32BitDiskAccess=off" in SYSTEM.INI, however the majority of modern
386 PCs using uncompressed MFM, RLL, & ISA drives *should* be able to
use the fast access. It will be interesting to see if the disk
compression bundled with DOS 6.0 will also block this.

(Note: SafeMBR does not go resident & does not bother Windows 3.1)

Now I *know* how to fix the problem with DiskSecure & will be
providing a module soon to allow 32bit Windows disk access, but even
so, people hearing reports of Win 3.1 suddenly failing on 32 Bit Disk
access should be suspicious of a possible virus infection.

It certainly is a pain to test for this sort of thing.  For a
developer to test to make sure that all other popular anti-virus tools
aren't leaving bits of viruses in memory is time-consuming and no fun.
On the other hand, it's comparatively *easy* to make sure that one's
own tool doesn't leave virus fragments around (any competent
programmer can set things up so that the signatures scanned for never
appear "in clear" in memory at all).  I can't think of any
justification, with the marketplace now as mature as it is, for any
serious anti-virus program to still leave virus fragments around in
memory on a clean system.

The folks at Norton Technical Support say that if the file is not a

They also claim that a new testing algorithm is being prepared for a

Subject: Scan/Clean vs. F-protect (PC)

I recently did a test on McAfee's Clean vs. f-protect for the
universities local electronic virus conference.  I thought some of you
here on virus-l might like to see my results.  Basically, I was
pointing out that scan and clean don't identify viruses very well, as
well as that f-protect will do a better job of disinfecting a boot
sector virus anyway.

________________ cut here __________

When I try to disinfect a disk infected with azusa with the command
Clean [stoned] it says it can't find the virus.  But, when I try to
disinfect a disk infected with michaelangelo with the command Clean
[stoned] it butchers the boot sector.  Actually Clean butchered the
boot sector no matter what command line prompt I gave it.  You can
draw your own conclusions from that.  I created three disks infected
with the Michaelangelo virus, and tested (a) Clean [stoned], (b) Clean
[mich], and (c) f-protect on it.  The results of my little experiement
are listed below.

1)  Clean will run with the incorrect virus identifer.

2)  This may be because stoned and michaelangelo are a lot the same.

3)  F-Protect correctly disinfected my disk, while Clean butchered the boot
          sector on my disk.  This happened with both clean [stoned] and clean
          [mich].

4)  I used Cleanv95, and F-Protect v2.05.  These are the two most current
          releases of each product.

Below is the NDD report for each disinfection session.

Subject: Re: A less virus prone architecture

In theory, a machine with a strict division between program and data
stores would certainly be less prone to viral attack.  The
"non-existence" of the mythical CMOS virus is an example.  However,
this separation would have other consequences.  For example,
compilation of source into object and then running the object would
require an intermediate step.  Certainly not an insurmountable
obstacle, but inconvenient.  And, the more convenient you made it, the
more prone it would be to viral attack.

Regarding Ken's note: yes, sorta and yes.  A model has been made of
his earlier analytical engine, but I doubt that any serious attempt
will be made to build the difference engine.  As I understand it, it
requires several hectares of land and at least six steam engines.
However a computer model has been made, and Ada's original program has
finally been run on it (after some debugging).

Well, I'd certainly be interested in reading a concrete proposal.  The
thing that makes viruses possible is not that programs and data occupy
the same *memory* space in the way that we usually think about memory.
It's that they occupy the same *storage* space.  That is, it's not the
RAM layout that matters, it's the disk layout.  Conventional viruses
are possible because programs are allowed to alter other (stored)
programs.  If that weren't possible, it'd certainly impact the spread
of viruses.  On the other hand, you couldn't run a compiler, save a
spreadsheet macro, or even edit a BAT file!

Nope, no, uh uh, wrong, won't work.

Viral programs cannot infect swipe cards, ID cards or smart cards (at
least, not until they get to be a whole lot smarter).  These cards
contain data only which is never interpretted as a program.
Therefore, viral programs cannot "infect" and reproduce via that
medium.

As far as a virus goes.. doubtful... It most likely just contains some
info on you and/or an Index to some information on you. It might be
possible to 'infect' the computer by someother method that could
'erase' you from the computer.

about the mag-stripe thingy.. I read about some guys that built one
and re-incoded their credit cards with other peoples numbers..
