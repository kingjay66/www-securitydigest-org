If you mean IBM's VIRSCAN, yes definitely.  It's been detecting the
Joshi since sometime in 1990.  The Joshi is, of course, stealthed, so
if the virus is active in memory it will only be detected in memory,
not on disks.

Subject: Stacker problems (PC)

  The last few months I've observed a lot of discussion on
  the automatic write protection of stacker drives as a result
  of allocation errors.
  I had this unfortunate experience this weekend as a result
  I dialed into the stacker BBS which was listed in the manual.
  They have several nice utilities and text files that you can d/l
  for troubles and updates.
  Below I have included the text file I d/l on how to get out of
  the write-protected problem.

STACKER NOTE                            Stac Electronics Technical Note

SUBJECT: Write Protected Stacker Drives.

Tec035 - 6/10/92
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

When file corruption such as a damaged temp file is detected, Stacker
will write protect the drive as a means of safeguarding data.  This
forces the user to run Stacker's SCHECK /F, to repair logical data
structures before anything else can be written to the drive.  Stacker
will also write protect a mounted drive if it has not been "padded" to
its full size.  The fix for this condition involves the SCREATE
program and is discussed in greater detail in section III.

I. Fixing Errors with SCHECK /F:

SCHECK is similar to the DOS CHKDSK program in that it checks for and
repairs allocation unit errors.  Unlike CHKDSK's work at the DOS
cluster level, SCHECK will diagnose and repair at the sector level.
Stacker's ability to store on a sector by sector basis makes this a
necessity.  Because SCHECK only repairs sector allocation errors, it
will recommend using CHKDSK to fix any DOS cluster allocation errors
that it has detected.  Sometimes SCHECK will offer to delete damaged
files.  It is able to do this even though the drive is write
protected.  If it offers to do this, make a backup copy of the file
and let SCHECK delete it.  After SCHECK has made its repairs, the
write protection may then be removed by rebooting or by unmounting
then re-mounting the drive.

II. Forcing SCHECK to remove the write protection:

DOS errors can be repaired by CHKDSK or another disk repair utility
such as Norton Disk Doctor or PCTOOLS Diskfix.  Because SCHECK will
not repair all DOS errors, it may be necessary to force SCHECK to
remove the write protection before one of these utilities may be used.
This should ONLY be done AFTER SCHECK /F has repaired any Stacker
errors.  Remove the write protection by typing: SCHECK /=w d: where d:
is the write protected drive.  NOTE: DO NOT use this option if the
Stacker drive has been mounted as (SIZE MISMATCH) (Write Protected).
See section III.

Scheck /=w will return the following message.  Follow its advice.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The read only status of drive D has been cleared so that you may
delete those files which contain errors.  However, the damage to drive
D has not yet been repaired!"

        DO NOT ATTEMPT TO WRITE OR CHANGE ANY DATA ON DRIVE D UNTIL
        YOU HAVE COMPLETED ALL OF THE FOLLOWING STEPS:

        1) DELETE THE FILES CONTAINING THE ERRORS
        2) REBOOT YOUR COMPUTER
        3) RUN SCHECK /F D:

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Restart the system after step 3 to reset the status of the Stacker
drive.

III. Repairing a (Size Mismatched), (Write Protected) Drive.

Stacking a drive is a three step process.  First, construction of the
Stacker drive companion file (STACVOL.DSK) begins as compressed files
are copied into it.  After all the files have been added, Norton
Speedisk is run to defragment this file and optimize the host drive.
The last step is to "pad" the file (add the free space).  If the
process halts for some reason, such as Speedisk discovering a bad
sector or someone tripping over the power cord, the Stacvol file will
be undersized.  Upon reboot, as the drive is mounted, the message
(Size Mismatched) (Write Protected) will be displayed.  In order to
continue where Speedisk left off and pad the file, it is necessary to
use the Screate program as follows:

    Note: insert the Stacker program diskette and issue these commands from
          the floppy drive prompt.

        1. Unmount the Stacker drive by typing:  Stacker -c:
                c: is the letter of the drive you wish to unmount.

        2. Run SCREATE d: /P
                where d: is the letter of the host drive containing the
                Stacvol file.

        3. After receiving the message  "volume created successfully" ,
           reboot to mount the drive.

answer 1:  If the virus scanner reporting the false positive does at least
   some minimal checking, it would report the file not as infected, but as
   containing a new variant, ask you to send a copy to the producer or
   something like that.  So, in that case, you will at least know that it
   is not just a regular, infected file.  Better yet - get a "second opinion"
   and run another scanner.

answer 2: If you have a virus infection at all, it is usually all over the
   machine.  So, if an anti-virus reports only a small set of related files
   (or ever just one file) as infected, and if you have benn using the
   "infected" file for a reasonably long time it is quite likely that this is
   a false alarm - if it was a real virus it would have spread.

Forget it.  The published C code is useless against stealth viruses.
If you want to do it properly you have to use something else.

 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^According to the Resource Kit, on 
installation of Windows, 32 Bit access is set to off even if the control-
ler is capable of 32 bit access.  It is explained that this is done because
some controllers appear to the setup program to be capable of 32 bit access
but in actuality are not capable.  The problem is indicated by the book as
occuring most often in portables with disk power management.  The book goes
on to say that it is up to the user to determine if 32bit access works
reliably.

Subject: N_shift virus (PC)

We received a copy of this virus, which is believed to have been 
found recently in Australia, 0n Oct 14th.  The following notes are 
based on a preliminary analysis, and many parts have not been 
analysed in detail. 

The virus is an alternating .EXE and Master Boot Record infector, 
and will only run on ATs and PCs with an 80286 or later 
microprocessor.  It is a complex virus, and analysis has been made 
more difficult by the inclusion of many 80286 specific instructions.  
It has a number of unusual features, and several nasty tricks which 
will cause the user serious inconvenience.  It claims to be 
destructive, but this appears to be bluff.

When an infected file is run the virus looks for the "AT" flag in 
the BIOS (FC at address FFFF:000Eh).  If this is found (and the 
MBR is not already infected) the virus overwrites the original MBR, 
without saving it, and writes 12 more sectors to track zero, head 
zero, starting at sector three.  It also writes zeroes to bytes 
34 & 35 in the CMOS RAM.  These two bytes are subsequently used 
as an elapsed time counter, which determines when the various 
nasty tricks come into play.  These bytes are defined as "Reserved", 
and apparently are normally unused.  

The virus then disinfects the original file (whether or not it 
infected the hard disk) and writes the clean version back to the 
original disk.  It then loads the original program and permits 
it to run normally.

When a PC with an infected hard disk is booted the virus goes 
resident, reserving 7K at the top of memory, and traps Ints 8, 
9, 11, 17 & 21.  Int 8 (timer tick) is used to increment the 
counter in CMOS RAM each minute.  This enables various nasty 
tricks after different delays. 

The Int 21 handler looks for functions 30 (Get version no), 4b 
(Load & execute), and 4e (Find first).  It appears that the 
virus only infects files returned by 4e (Find First) and only 
if they are .EXE files between 8000 & 327,680 bytes in length.  
If this is correct it is a very ineffective infection procedure.  
We certainly had trouble getting infected samples.  When a file 
is infected the length is increased by (decimal) 6672 bytes.  

The other interrupts are used to harrass the user.  After the 
virus has been present for 10 days and 10 hours the Int 9 
(keyboard) handler will occasionally randomly either ignore 
keystrokes, or trigger a RESET.  

After 13 days and 13 hours Int 21, function 4b (Load & execute 
a program) will sometimes cause a message stating that the 
hard disk is being formatted to appear. Meanwhile random 
sectors are read, so that the disk light remains on, but 
it appears that no damage is actually done. 

After 15 days & 15 hours Int 21, function 30 (Get DOS version) 
will always return version 2.0, and this will cause many 
programs to abort.

VET 7.06 can detect this virus, and restore infected files.  
It cannot safely disable the virus, so it will ask the user 
to reboot from a clean disk if the virus is detected in memory.  
If the Master Boot Record is infected, and VET has been 
previously installed for the PC, VETHDFIX can put back the 
saved copy of the MBR.  Otherwise VET can replace it with a 
"Plain Vanilla" boot sector.  This will normally work 
perfectly, but we cannot guarantee it will work on all PCs.

Subject: "LARRY ON A SCREEN" Virus (PC)

This virus was first reported (to our knowledge) by Brian Mariott,
Dept of Computer Science, University of Tasmania, on Virus L, on 7th
Oct.  They received it from a computer shop, which had found it on a
PC brought in by a customer.  We received a sample on Oct 20th.

It is a resident .COM & .EXE infector, adding 491 & 507 bytes 
respectively.  Like Troi2, recently reported, it hides in the 2nd 
half of the interrupt table, overwriting interrupts 80 to FF, and, 
like Troi 2, it frequently crashed in our tests, again presumably 
because it overloads the system stack.  It has one most unusual 
bug; it gives a "Write protect error writing drive .." message 
(and usually hangs), if you run a program from a write protected 
disk - even if the file is already infected!

The virus uses the word 'GM' (474dh) as the signature.  This is 
found at offset 4 in .COM files, and at offset 12h (the checksum 
field) in the .EXE header.  The message below can be seen almost 
at the end of infected files.  

It includes a counter (set to 19 in our sample) which is 
decremented each time a program is infected.  When the counter 
reaches zero the message 

                          Larry on a Screen

is displayed instead of running the program.

This virus does not pose a serious threat, as it does no 
deliberate damage, and is so unreliable that most users will 
realise something is wrong, even before they get the message.

VET 7.06 will detect this virus, and restore infected files.  
It will also detect and repair files infected with Shifter 
(also recently found in Australia), and will detect a number
of viruses recently discovered overseas.

VIRUSCAN Version 97 was released on the evening of Friday, October 16,
so your preliminary testing of VIRUSCAN did not involve the most
latest version of SCAN available.  Version 95-B was released on August
19 (my birthday, btw *<:-), which was before we received any
.EXE-infecting viruses based on the Dark Avenger Mutation Engine.
Naturally, it is included in the current release of SCAN.

I can understand your desire to provide the readers of comp.virus with
timely, accurate information about the efficacy of different anti-viral
packages, however, posting one message decrying the deficiencies of
one brand of software with an endnote about other packages sounds less
like a genuine attempt at impartial research and more like alarmist scare
tactics, or even worse, marketing :-)  I note that several other anti-viral
packages such as NAV, CPAV, Untouchable, Novi are not mentioned at all.

In any case, I would strongly suggest that you complete your research in 
the future before posting incomplete results.

Hi Carlos,
After FLIP becomes resident,any COM or EXE files executed will come infected
If a program is executed which uses an overlay file,the overlay file will
also infected.
Systems infected FLIP may experience file allocation errors resulting in
file linkage error.Some data files may become corrupted.

On the second of any month,systems wich were booted from an infected harddisk
and have an EGA or VGA capable display adapter may experience the display on
the system monitor being horizontally "flipped" between 16.00 and 16.59

Subject: MBR infections and problems CLEANing (PC)

I am somewhat surprised that people are having trouble removing such
common problems particularly since these viruses are about the easiest
possible to eradicate: much easier than most .COM and .EXE infectors.

Actually, they call into two categories, those which leave the disk able
to boot from a floppy and those which do not.

First, to reiterate some basics: on a DOS disk the MBR consists of two
parts, the MBR code which is executable code used only when booting from
the fixed disk, and the partition table which is needed whether booting 
from floppy or the hard disk.

The partition table is the most important since it must follow a very 
strict protocol defined (for one source) in the DOS Technical Reference
manual published by IBM. The one I use most is for DOS 3.3 simply because
it is close at hand.

If the partition table is missing or corrupt, one of two things will happen:
ether the machine will fail to boot at all, or, if booting from floppy
disk, DOS will fail to recognise the hard disk(s). Reguardless of what
DOS thinks, a BIOS approach can *always* repair the system (including
"unbootable" ones as reported recently).

In the case of those infections that leave the system able to boot from 
floppy, repair is easy since the partition table may be found in sector
one and further, those values may be quickly and easily checked against
the information stored both in the BIOS and on the disk itself.

Given a good partition table, repair is *usually* accomplishable by just
replacing the MBR code with a valid program. This is the approach I take
with FixMBR and FixFBR, I do not try to find the original code (unless
instructed to), I just replace it with my own.

In the case of the FreeWare SafeMBR code this also adds non-resident BIOS
level integrity checking. I am gratified to see that at least one other
anti-viral product, the Dr. Panda Utilities, have also picked up on this
technique. Also note that this technique can be used with any system that
does not require a "special" MBR, I have used it on OS/2 and a Novell 3.11
server without problem. (BIOS is BIOS)

On the other hand, those few viruses that leave the disk unbootable 
generally store the original sector 1 in one of the other "hidden sectors".
In the case of STONED and MICHELANGELO this is sector 7. JOSHI leaves it
in sector 9 (note - these particular ones do not leave the disk unbootable
(quiet Vess 8*) rather they are common examples for the technique). In this
case it is still a simple matter to "walk the disk" looking for a valid
(see above) partition table. Once this is found, then the program may
proceed as above.

However, these viruses spread poorly since people are usually quick to 
notice a system that cannot be booted from floppy.

I believe that the problem with certain virus removers is that they either
accidently pick up a sector that does not contain a valid P-table without
performing proper checks, or try to get fancy with it. KISS works (people 
complaining about loss of partitions after using NDD *please* do not 
contact me).

Further, this technique could care less about viruses, it ignores them 
completely - the only suggestion is to boot from a clean floppy first. 
This is the basic difference between integrity management and anti-virus
programs, a philosophy which finally seems to be starting to catch on.

				Warmly,
					Padgett

ps for those of you interested in my DiskSecure project, a major step 
   forward was accomplished two days ago: a Novell 3.11 server sucessfully
   transitioned from DOS to NetWare with DS II resident. (and they said it
   couldn't be done). RSN

  I am also getting some discrepencies about the Keypress virus.
Running Scan97 on a sample of the virus, it reported that the file was
infected 3 times. (i.e. The message "Found Keypress Virus..." appeared
3 times.) This was reported again on a variant as well as some other
files I tested with the same virus. I know that the files have been
infected only once.

The latest version of CLEAN-UP is Version 97.

>got infected with simple keypress virus so I cleaned it with clean95c.

When you ran CLEAN-UP (CLEAN.EXE) did you use the /A switch to tell it
to check all files on the disk.  By default, CLEAN will only check
files with the extensions .COM, .EXE, and some of the more common
overlay extensions.  It could be that you have an infected file with
an uncommon extension that CLEAN did not check when you ran it
initially.  Try running it by typing:

		CLEAN C: [KEY] /A

and pressing enter from the DOS command line.  That will allow it to look
for the virus in all files and remove it, if found.

Were you using different options with SCAN V95 and SCAN V97?  The /NOMEM
switch, for example, would turn off scanning memory for viruses entirely.  
Before using either, did you power down the PC and boot it from a clean 
(that is, virus-free) DOS boot disk?  You may have had the virus in memory,
or loaded an infected SCAN.EXE file (did SCAN warn you that it had been
damaged when you ran it?).

It's possible that a fragment of the virus exists somewhere, stuck at the
end of a file, which is causing a false alarm.  This can usually be fixed
by defragmenting the hard disk with a disk optimizing program after 
disinfection.

Unknown at this point.  It would be a good idea to run CLEAN again with
the /A switch.  If problems persist, try Version 97 (also with the /A
switch).  If problems persist, please contact me.

Subject: Re: Oliver virus ... (PC)

Hello *8),

Earlier this month (Oct. 12th, perhaps), a television station in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania started broadcasting news items about a
virus named "Oliver" that was supposed to 'wipe out hard disks whilst
displaying politically incorrect messages.'

The limited description of the virus bears more than a passing
resemblance to a fictional virus written on a Banana computer by
superhacker Oliver Wendell Jones in the cartoon "Outland" drawn by
Berkeley Breathed of "Bloom County" fame.  Interestingly enough, if
you look on page 60 "Toons For Our Times" (an anthology of "Bloom
County" cartoons) [Little Brown & Co., 1984.  ISBN 0-316-10709-3]
you'll find that the computer is also identified as an "IBM 6000"
whatever that is. :-) But I digress.

The TV station apparently got the story from a computer consultancy in
Chestnut Hill, PA (?) named Cyber-something-or-other Associates.  They
ran segments on the virus for two days on the morning news, reporting
on both days that the virus was going to activate on the following
day.  Nothing happened, and the last I heard, the TV station was
considering legal action against the consultant.

PS: While no 'Oliver' virus exists in the U.S. (I believe Vesselin
mentioned a hack of the Dark Avenger virus), I would not be surprised
if this tempts some would-be virus-writers into creating one--a
possibility given the prevalence of build-a-virus programs.  :-( Of
course, with the existing VCL kits I've seen, they probably won't
work! :-) AG

We have had the FORM virus in a big way around the University this
year.  I have no idea why this virus should become so widespread but
there have been previous reports on this board concerned with an
apparent increase in the number of sightings this year.

The version we have here triggers on the 18th of the month.  Students
have reported corrupt files on their floppies though this only seems
to happen if the disk was nearly full before the infection took place.
For a hard disk, a clean boot and the DOS SYS command is enough.
There are of course any number of anti-virus programs which will do
the job.

Is there a list of which boot sector viruses can be disinfected from a
hard disk using FDISK /MBR?

Will FDISK /MBR work for them all or are there any interesting "gotchas"
using this method?

As always thanks in advance

But the anti-virus program should be able to run with the virus active
in memory - because it will be there after the BOOT DOS command,
right? The program should de-activate the virus and then disinfect the
boot sector...

On the technical point, it sounds like you just need a good copy
of uuencode, or you need to talk to some local guru who can observe
and see what went wrong in more detail.

On another note, though: your "All Rights Reserved" there conflicts
sharply with your desire to make it available to lots of people for
review via FTP.  As long as your copyright notice says that you've
reserved all rights to yourself, no one who works for a company that
has lawyers is going to be able to make a copy of it (via FTP, for
instance) for himself...
