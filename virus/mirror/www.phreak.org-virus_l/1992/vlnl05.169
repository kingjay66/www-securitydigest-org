Really?  Does anyone know of any evidence for this, or is it just a
quote from some commercial virus info list?  I don't recall ever
seeing this in a FLIP infection, or seeing any code in the virus that
would cause this.  A few publicly-available virus lists make this
claim for every third or fourth virus, and I've always wondered why.
Does anyone know any technical reason this should occur?

I can confirm this. The scanning engine of SCAN has a minor bug - it
does not always stop scanning after a virus is found, so it can report
more than one virus in the file, if more than one scan signature is
found.

This would be correct, if it used to scan the entire file - because
then it would be able to detect ALL viruses that are eventually
present in it. However, SCAN uses a method, known as top-and-tail
scanning - it scans part of the beginning of the file, part of the end
of the file, and part of the file after the entry point. The general
idea is that normally a virus wants to get control as soon as the file
is executed, so it should intercept the control at one of these three
places... Unfortunately, this is not always the case, which explains
why SCAN does not detect Commander Bomber infections reliably - the
virus can reside just anywhere in the file and control is transferred
to it in a non-trivial way...

Well, in the particular case of the Keypress virus, it seems that SCAN
contains a scan string for it, which is encountered up to three times
in the virus. The bug mentioned above (that scanning does not always
stop after the first virus is found), makes the scanner report the
virus three times when only one virus is present in the file.

In fact, it seems that SCAN 97 always reports most of the Keypress
variants three times in the infected EXE files and two times in the
infected COM files.

There is some strong suspicion that a large diskette producing company
has shipped a large batch of pre-formatted diskettes, infected with
this virus. I would strongly advise anyone who is buying pre-formatted
diskettes, to open a package at random, to select one diskette at
random, to WRITE-PROTECT it (this is important!), and to scan it. If
it happens to be infected, PLEASE DO NOT USE ANY OTHER DISKETTE from
the package. Send the whole package (if possible - accompanied with
another one, without the shrink wrap removed) to an anti-virus
researcher.

It is possible that somebody has re-compiled a disassembly of the
virus and has forgot to put a ".radix 16" directive. Note that 24 
decimal is the same as 18 hexadecimal.

Yes, this can happen. The virus stores a copy of the original boot
sector on the last sector of the disk. If this sector happens to be
occupied by a file, this file will be damaged.

When the preliminary tests were done, the latest available version of
SCAN was 95b. Since the results were alarming, I decided that it is my
duty to inform the users about a particular deficency in the then
latest version of the product. Even if a newer version of the product
were available (which it wasn't then), and even if it were able to
detect the MtE-based viruses reliably (which it still isn't, see
below), my message would alarm the users to urgently upgrade to the
newer version. I still think that there is nothing incorrect in what I
have done.

> .EXE-infecting viruses based on the Dark Avenger Mutation Engine.
> Naturally, it is included in the current release of SCAN.

Naturally. I downloaded the newest (still newest, as I am typing this
message) version of SCAN - version 97, just two days after I have
posted the message. I received an announcement from Simtel20 that it
is available the day before, but our ftp connection was out of order.
Anyway, as soon as it was physically possible for us, I downloaded the
newest version. In fact, parts of the package were still downloading,
when one of our students took SCAN 97 and repeated the test with this
version. I posted the results as soon as they were available.

The results are rather poor - they clearly show that version 97 of
SCAN is not able to detect reliably ANY of the MtE-based viruses too.
I have proven this to you, by sending you a batch of examples that
SCAN 97 was unable to detect. I have also offered to help you fixing
the problem and even suggested an easy solution for the other 284
missed samples. What do you want more?

It's very strange to see the above posted by someone from McAfee
Associates... Even if we don't pay attention to the fact that it does
not correspond to the truth (as I explained above), I still remember
an article posted somewhere (maybe even here), which described how
McAfee Associates sponsored a particular set of anti-virus product
evaluations and insisted that only old versions of the scanners of
their main competitors were tested.

I don't have a copy of Novi. And, unlike your product, all the
products mentioned above are not shareware - they are all commercial,
so I obviously cannot easily get the latest versions as quickly as
with your product. Besides, I am only a human and cannot do everything
at once. In fact, the MtE tests even of your product were made
possible mainly because two visiting students from Rostok spent a lot
of time to generate 16,000 naturally infected samples (do you
understand what all this means, having in mind that some of the
MtE-based viruses infect only 2-3 samples in the current directory and
do not go resident?), and one of our students urgently ran two tests
(with version 95b and 97 of SCAN) and summarized the results...

I -will- publish MtE detection data for 17 scanners, each of which
claims (like yours) that it is able to detect all MtE-based viruses
with 100% reliability... As I said, I don't know about Novi, because
I don't have it, but NAV 2.1, CPAV 1.3, and UTScan 23.00.12 (the
scanner part of the Untouchable, since Untouchable is mainly an
integrity-based product) all failed the test - just like SCAN 97, they
turned out to be unable to detect all MtE-based viruses used during
the test reliably.

I am doing my best to provide the most complete data possible to the
users. So does the rest of the VTC-Hamburg. What has been observed in
SCAN 95b was a BUG, that's why I was precipitated to publish the
information about it. Or do you want to hide from your users that a
particular (even if not the latest) version of your program is buggy
and provides a false sense of security?

I will post the complete summary of the tests when it is ready.
Meanwhile, the results for SCAN 97 are ready and I already posted
them. They do not speak well for SCAN's ability to detect the
MtE-based viruses - NONE of them was detected reliably.

Not per se, but *almost* any disk infected with an MBR virus that can
be properly cold booted with a floppy is a likely candidate. All of
those that meet the above criteria which I know of can. (was that
English ?)

>Will FDISK /MBR work for them all or are there any interesting "gotchas"
>using this method?

An easy test is to boot from a floppy and first use the *documented*
DOS 5.0 command "UNFORMAT/PARTN/TEST/L" & do a reasonableness test on
the result. If it looks good, try FDISK /MBR. A "plain vanilla" disk
should report a DOS12 or DOS 16 Boot starting on cyl 0 Head 1 Sector
1.

Since FDISK /MBR simply replaces the MBR code and does not touch the
partition table, even if it does not cure the problem, it is *usually*
safe to use.

My FixMBR combines features to a large extent with the addition of
being able to "walk the disk" if a good partition table is not found
in sector 1 and will install the *FreeWare* SafeMBR code if requested.
In addition it is compatable with DOS 2.0 up, allows saving the
original MBR "just in case", and asks for confirmation before making
any changes.

Well I do not work under grants from anyone (except my wife 8*) nor do
I have any equipment supplied by either not-for-profits or a
university.  (offers to change this condition are welcome 8*). For
that as for other reasons (my wife again), I do "reserve rights" to my
original work.

However, of the elements contained in the FixUtils, only two (FixMBR
and FixFBR) are ShareWare, other utilities are all FreeWare including
the new MBR/DBR code which is written by FixMBR/FixDBR.

This is *not* public domain, however for many individuals the postage
would be higher than the registration fee. Since none use scanning,
there is no need for periodic updates.

For that matter the .DOCs contain all of the information necessary for
a agile mind to duplicate my work (the .DOCs are larger than the
programs).

For any lawyers concerned about this there are two alternatives:
1) Shareware automatically has a "30 day free trial"
2) Send me a "no-cost-30 day evaluation PO" *with* a SASE & I'll return it

I'd like to start a brief tangent on the question of how many files
are generally infected in a file-infector incident.  Does anyone have
any interesting experience of insights to share?  Some viruses, of
course, spread much faster than others; the DIR II infects whole
directories at once, the Dark Avenger can spread very fast if you GREP
a bunch of executables, and so on.  But from my experience, I have the
general impression that in a typical 1813 incident (say) the number of
infected files on a single machine is under 100.  Even a Dark Avenger
incident is usually about that size, with the obvious occasional
severe exceptions.

Does that sound reasonable or unreasonable to anyone?  (This isn't
intended as a disagreement with Vesselin; his words just struck the
thought in my mind, and I thought I'd ask...)

"Stoned" and "Michelangelo" both relocate the original boot sector to
Side 1 Sector 3 on a floppy diskette.  On 1.2 MB and 1.44 MB
diskettes, this is Sector 3 of the root directory (directory entries
for files 33-48).  If the diskette has more than 32 files on it, the
entries for files 33-48 will get wiped out, and files 49-224 will not
be accessible by DOS.  Also, a small number of files with strange
names may appear, depending on the contents of the boot sector (this
is a result of DOS trying to interpret the boot sector code as
directory entries).  Now, if files in excess of 32 are written to the
diskette, their entries will be written over the misplaced boot sector
code.  Then, if the diskette is disinfected, the boot sector will get
trashed, or more correctly, has already been trashed.  I have seen
this happen a number of times, and have had to recover the damage.
This might be the problem that Mr. Bradshaw is having.

The sample of Form that I have is the variant that triggers on the
18th of the month.  When it infects a 360 KB floppy (I haven't tried
it with other densities), it allocates Cluster 34 (Sectors 76 and 77)
to itself and marks it as a bad block.  It may be possible that, if
Cluster 34 is in use, the file which used it would then be damaged.
However, if the virus tries searching for an available cluster and the
diskette was full or nearly full, it could be possible that the virus
would go ahead and grab a used cluster.  I haven't tested it enough to
see how it infects under these circumstances, but perhaps this is
enough to be of use to you.

Ken (our fearless moderator) has said of VIRUS-L:

However, a recent exchange between two otherwise professional
subscribers seemed more like an unmerited mutual bashing contest than
a series of "relevant, concise, polite" contributions.

Aryeh Goretsky really pounced upon Vesselin Bontchev for using an
older version of McAfee's ViruScan (version 95B) in preparing his
review, so his testing "did not involve the most latest version of
SCAN available" (version 97, released on 16 October 1992).  However,
Mr. Bontchev's testing was conducted before this version was released,
as evidenced by the fact that his posting was dated 16 October 1992.
Therefore, his testing DID INDEED involve the "most latest" [sic]
version available.  Further, Mr. Bontchev replied to his own posting,
indicating that he had obtained and was testing version 97.  So Mr.
Goretsky's attack was, in this respect, unwarranted (in my opinion).

On the other hand, I agree with Mr. Goretsky that Mr. Bontchev (or
anyone for that matter) should complete any testing before posting
results.  Also, Mr. Bontchev's posting seemed to me (as well as Mr.
Goretsky) to specifically slam ViruScan.  An independent review should
test all products equally, then objectively report the results against
each other or against some fixed rating.  It should also include the
specific version tested (which Mr. Bontchev did, BTW), especially
considering how rapidly anti-viral programs are updated.

This, as well as other, similar exchanges, has caused VIRUS-L, a
discussion list I consider very valuable, to become increasingly
irritating to read.  While there may be times that people need to
speak out against something (e.g. Virus Simulator or CPAV's causing
false positives), please keep the heat down and the professionalism
up.

V-sign disinfection was added later - 2.05a could only detect it, not remove.
The next version to be released should do the trick - but for now I guess
the "FDISK /MBR" disinfection method is the best way to get rid of it.

Hi Carl.

I'm a VirusCURE 2.37 user and I have some impressions about it:

Maybe I haven't tested many a_v products (just McAfee's ViruScan,
Fridrik's F-PROT, CPAV 1.0, AntiKot, etc.).  VirusCure is the only
product that is able to deactivate a living memory-resident virus.
I got 15 (holy-few) viruses and I had tested VirusCure against all
of them and got good results.

By the way, VirusCure fails on disinfection of even well known viruses,
like Ping-Pong, but it's not a frequent symptom.  It just could be a bug.

Documentation says VirusCure is developed together with John McAfee,
however IMSI doesn't release a new version since February or March...
I just trust on those products that update very frequently.

Hope this helps,

It seems that I have some sort of problem here. I was running my
386-40 and all of a sudden I heard my hard drive stop. O.k. fine. I
rebooted, it happened again. It started up in a second but it kept
happening. When I rebooted, my memory-manager wouldn't load, so i made
a boot disk and when I scanned my HD using Norton Anti-Virus 2.0 it
said it had a couple of files with possible viruses. But knowing the
way Norton scans, I tried McAffee scan and it gave me nothing. I
deleted the files but I'm not sure if I should still be worried. Does
this sound like a virus or just a disk error?

I found some files (.pk files for emtex) truncated to exactly 2048
bytes. do you think, that the reason was a virus, or do you think,
that there might be an error in emtex?

A while ago I saw a program that showed the behaviour of a number of
viruses.  I'd like to get a copy if this, if possible.  Can anyone
point me in the right direction?

Thanks

It could be that the WHEREIS.EXE file was damaged.  It is always
possible for even the most benign computer virus to cause damage by
incorrectly infecting a file, either due to bugs in its own code or
conflicts with other programs on the system.

Hmm.. have you run CLEAN against your hard disk with the /A switch?
If so, then there could be a remnant of code at the end of the file
between the true end of the file, expressed in bytes, and the space
allocated for the file on the disk, expressed in clusters.  If a file
does not fill up the entire last cluster, then DOS pads it with
garbage from memory--which could be a segment of viral code.  This
should not cause problems with VSHIELD, however.  In any case, try
defragmenting the disk with a disk optimizing program or running the
WIPEFILE or WIPEINFO program from Norton (can't remember which one is
included with Norton 5.0) with the option used to erase the "slack"
space at the end of the file--BE VERY CAREFUL with this as you can
erase everything on your hard disk if you do not use the right switch.

Interesting.  That pretty much rules out my comments above about
defragging the disk.  I would guess, then, that you (1) have a variant
of the virus; (2) have an .EXE file with an unusual structure [which
doesn't account for why SCAN and CLEAN missed it]; (3) didn't run
CLEAN with the /A switch the first time around and NDD is loading as
an overlay some file that was skipped; or (4) SCAN & CLEAN are broken
[unlikely, given that VSHIELD's working].

<...deleted for brevity...>
>Has anyone had a similar virus?
<...rest of message deleted...>

Nope.

If you've tried the above and are still having problems, please
contact me by email and we'll see can be done to get the virus off of
your PC once and for all.

Try scan_os2.  It is currently in beta.  Version 97 is on 
ftp-os2.nmsu.edu in the pub/uploads directory.

Subject: Questions about the "Batman Virus" (Atari ST)

Usually the Atari ST requires the bootsector to have a checksum of
$1234, if the bootsector is to be able to execute. This includes
Viruses, Virus Protectors, Games Disks etc.

There is a(UK Computer Mag), it can execute without having the
neccessary checksum! it can execute without the bootsector having the
neccessary checksum

How is this possible?
If it is possible, how is it done?
