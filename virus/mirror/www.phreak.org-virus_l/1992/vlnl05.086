Hi!

I had a similar problem about a month back, and thanks to everyone who
responded.  I found that this occurred only with DOS 5.0.  As my
understanding of Boot Sector Infectors was the same as this Scot's, I
was highly surprised at the scanning results after a DIR.

Maybe this can be added to the FAQ.  To answer Scot's question, DOS
stores the Boot sector information in the buffers, and that triggers
F-Prot.  Having researched this a lot, I can add that this only occurs
if you are using DOS 5.0 (have tried DOS 3.2, and 3.3)

What I realized was that after upgrading to DOS 5.0 at home, I had
never come across an infected disk (can you believe that?!).  I always
scan the disks in the labs before taking them home (Labs use DOS 3.30,
and thus I never had this problem earlier.  Only clean disks make it
to my home).  Anyway we have a very clean environment over here,
having a site licence from Frisk.

Secondly, Does anyone know of a site where detailed information about
a particular virus?  That's the reason I wasn't able to send copies of
my Joshi to the guys who requested; I don't know in which sectors
Joshi stores itself (didn't wanna send an image of the whole disk).

A couple of comments about VET.  I think it seems to be pretty neat
program, and Vesselin might be being too critical about it.  In hands
of a Novice, it can cause problems, but so can a disinfector, or
programs like SAFEMBR.  What about Hueristic analysis!  (not to add
false positives to it)  All these programs can only work in the hands
a power user, and so will VET.

They are always polymorphic - in fact, the only thing the MtE does is
to add polymorphic ability to a virus.

It may or may not be stealth - Pogue, Dedicated and Fear are not, but
somebody could add the engine to a "stealth" virus...

I guess I should clarify this.  My heuristic search does not find
anything suspicious in the programs in question - which is how it
should be - they are not viruses...

The program responsible for creating the message

    Possibly a dropper program for a new variant of Stoned

is my regular scanner.  It picks up one of the "Stoned" signature
strings in the file, but

   ..as it is not a boot sector, the program does not say "Infection"

   ..as it is not a boot sector dump (image) file, it is not identified
     as such.

   therefore my program assumes it is a dropper - intended to place some
   code on the boot sector.  However - it does not contain the
   "Stoned" virus -> therefore "possibly a new variant.

The problem is really that a piece of the code (used to write to the
MBR) is exactly like the code used by Stoned, and it is also the piece
of code I happened to use in my signature.

No, this is incorrect.  A virus by definition has to replicate itself -
just writing to the MBR or the boot sector is not sufficient.

Hello James.

Thank you for your attention to my little program AAVIRUS on SIMTEL20.
Concerning your question #2: *any* change to the boot sector or master
boot record will be noticed by AAVIRUS. So the question whether these
changes are caused by stealth or polymorphic viruses, or by viruses of
any kind, isn't as relevant as whether the reading (and writing) of
the boot sectors has been *redirected*, as some sophisticated boot
sector viruses do. In that case, AAVIRUS will read the original boot
records despite the presence of a bootsector virus, and will report
"everything looks fine".  The Tequila virus is an example.

Likewise, restoring boot sectors with AAVIRUS -r (or -e) might seem to
be successful, yet the memory resident virus could redirect this writing
to another location on the disk, leaving the corrupted boot sector
unchanged.

With the current version of AAVIRUS, the only remedy to both cases is to
start the pc with a clean system floppy, and then run AAVIRUS, specifying
[filename] and [disk]. That's far from ideal.

Of course, AAVIRUS could register the address of the disk read/write
routine at installation time, and compare this to the one at test time.
Up to now, I deliberately didn't implement this, because some memory
resident utilities like PC Tools, Sidekick, etc. also change this
interrupt vector. It would result in inconsistent warnings of AAVIRUS,
depending on whether you have loaded or unloaded such TSR's. Perhaps
I should make it an option, but on the other hand I would like to keep
the program as simple as possible. Besides its ability to restore things
under critical circumstances, simplicity should be a feature of AAVIRUS.

In the next version of AAVIRUS I will work this out. Also, I will extend
the program to checksum a limited number of program files (the user's
most frequently used). In case of contamination with a .EXE or .COM virus,
the programs most frequently used are the most likely to be infected.
And finally, the next version of AAVIRUS will be able to check and restore
CMOS data if present.

I hope having answered part of your questions.
Kind regards,

To Ken and VIRUS-L readers,

  I apologize for the duplicate message about "Stoned" and "No-Int."  I
never received acknowledgement that the first message was received, so
I incorrectly assumed that the list server never received the message,
and sent it again (bad choice).  Sorry.

[Moderator's note: It's at least partially my fault for not noticing
the duplicates...  (Sigh.)  I do get a lot of duplicates -
particularly from comp.virus readers who post to the newsgroup
multiple times when their message does not appear in the group
immediately - and I spot _most_ of them, but occasionally, they slip
through.]

In reply to Padgett Peterson's "walks and sounds like a duck" message:
How does one determine if a virus is actually a "strain" of another
virus, and not just distantly related to it?  The code for
"Michelangelo" does not look to me very much like "Stoned," though I
can see that they function similarly (except for the payload).  There
are some major differences, such as the structure of the data area and
the fact that "Stoned" (and closely-related viri) have two consecutive
jumps which start the code, while "Michelangelo" has just one.
Something like "Azusa," on the other hand, is obviously a strain of
"Stoned," as several sections of the code are not only the same as
those in "Stoned," but are also in the same location, and it also has
the two consecutive jumps.  I would think that a "virus strain" should
have a code-level resemblance to the virus of which it is a strain,
while a virus that is just "related" to another should have just a
functional resemblance to its counterpart.

I guess that this is what the AMC's Identification/Classification
committee is set up to decide.

Subject: Clarification on VDS 2.0 decoys (PC)

   Hello everyone,
   I hope the following will answer a few questions about VDS 2.0 decoys:
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
            CLARIFICATION ON VDS DECOYS & A WORD TO THE WISE

     The registered versions of VDS 2.0 have an enhanced decoy launching
mechanism to analyze the infection method used by an active virus in
memory, and to provide the user with various pieces of information.
This information includes the number of bytes added to (or removed from)
the decoy, the virus entry point, whether the original stack is
relocated (EXE only), and whether the virus attached to the end of the
file (as most do), and so on.
     We would like to point out that the results reported should be
taken as an automated attempt to provide the curious user with general
information about the observed behavior of a memory-resident virus, but
not as an accurate analysis of the viral code.  The best way to obtain
an accurate analysis is by careful examination of the viral code both
statically and by running it under a debugger.  The POV.CCC
(corresponding to COM attacker), and POV.XXX (corresponding to EXE
attacker) files can be analyzed for this purpose.  Of course, the person
attempting such analysis should be familiar with the evasive tactics
some viruses use to complicate reverse-engineering by removing single-
step or traces set, or encrypting a portion of their code.
     Some viruses are encrypted and defy static analysis attempts.  In
such cases, it is necessary to determine the decryption routine, write
a little program to decrypt the concealed areas of the virus, and then
examine the viral code.  All this involves a human expert with enough
patience, a sharp eye, and good assembler skills.  No automated tool
that we are aware of can be an adeqaute substitute. This is one of the
reasons why so-called "heuristic" analyzers should be used with caution.
     The purpose of the VDS decoy launching mechanism is quite
different: it provides the user with general information about the
observed behavior of a memory-resident virus as far as the modifications
it makes to its victims are concerned.  To attach other meanings or
purposes to the decoy launching mechanism of VDS is unwarranted.  Of
course, it also serves to indicate whether there is an active virus in
memory regardless of its name!  Even then, some viruses cannot be
captured in this way.
     Today, there are some products that attempt to do a similar
analysis and even remove such infections without establishing exact
identification.  We prefer to avoid adding such a capability to VDS at
this point, since we believe that the primary purpose of any anti-viral
program is to contain the spread of viruses by providing early detection
(not identification).  Recovery is a matter of restoring the affected
areas using good copies.  In other words, we do not foresee much
usefulness to a generic disinfection capability in practice, and caution
the user that some companies have marketing departments with full-time
hype-generating individuals.
     If someone tells you they can disinfect any virus without (even
with) specific identification of a virus, they are engaged in other
endeavors besides science dedicated to serving people's needs.

Subject: Virstop.exe version 2.03A locks my machine (PC)

I tried installing F-PROT 2.03A on my work machine yesterday.
Unfortunately, it refused to boot when I put virstop.exe in my
autoexec.bat.  Details:  I run a 486-25 clone (ISA bus) with a 64k
RAM cache, under MS-DOS 4.01.  Config.sys is:
     DEVICE=C:\util\CBLTRON\csipd_e.exe /H:5 /P:300
     stacks=16,256
     files= 30

     device=c:\dos\windows\smartdrv.sys 256
     shell=c:\dos\command.com /e:1024 /p
Autoexec.bat was:
     @ECHO OFF
     VERIFY On
     PATH c:\batch;C:\DOS;C:\UTIL;C:\util\CUTCP
     set COMSPEC=c:\dos\command.com

     C:\util\CUTCP\NOVELL\IPXCPD
     C:\util\CUTCP\NOVELL\NET4
     c:\util\f-prot\virstop.exe
Tests seem to indicate the conflict is with NET4 - i.e., with either of
the last two lines deleted from the autoexec.bat, the system boots okay.

Almost forgot - I also booted from a clean diskette and ran F-PROT 2.03A
to scan the hard disk, and it reports no problem, so I am assuming that
NET4 is in fact clean.

Hm, this sounds more like a bug in VSHield... Maybe it's trying to

The problem is that it detected them even when I instructed the
instalation program to unpack them. However, I guess that this is

How about -scanning- for the known false positives? After all, they

SCAN -does- detect it. It calls it 1575 / 1591 [15xx] (arrgh, when

(89-B) claims to be able to remove it, but I haven't verified that.

	Actually confirms the V-L discussions over the last two years
about software protections - almost anything will work so long as it
is unknown and unanticipated. The read-only bit worked as long as
no-one knew about it (not very long).

More dangerous since while this will protect against Int 21 functions,

Again, this will not provide any protection against things operating
on the BIOS level or even things reading from the DOS level and
writing through the BIOS. The versions mentioned will even tell you
how to reach the BIOS directly if you ask nicely. I agree that this
mechanism could be effective against most common file infectors seen
thusfar, but what about the DIR-II class which uses a BIOS technique.

Having said that, the programs will probably work as indicated to
reduce the 50% +/- of infections that stem from file infectors. My
feeling though is that a much more effective defense can be mounted
from the BIOS level to do the same thing (remember BYPASS) by write
protecting an entire partition, will also protect against MBR and Boot
Sector infections the other 50 % +/-), and is not DOS version or even
necessarily OS dependant.

Am glad to see people thinking about solutions though.

Sigh... It sounds pretty tempting, like an anti-virus programs

A heuristic analyser? Beurk... I would prefer something more reliable.

I fail to see why a triple memory scan is needed. Any stealth virus
can be caught in memory with a simple one-pass scan. They are stealth

Nope... When speaking about strong solutions, nothing that doesn't

Even if the whole message is a joke, the above is pretty realizable.
In fact, several anti-virus products already offer similar options (or
at least some of them, like automatic restoration of the boot sectors
and customized alert messages).

The only problem is to convince the virus to infect the decoy... :-)
Victor Charlie used a similar approach in the past... maybe still uses
it.

Jokes aside, I think that something like this can be found in Fred

Viruses".

All this is possible and in fact already available in several
products.

Ooops, mea culpa, I should have supplied this to the FAQ list...
Anyway, here is the answer:

Most monitoring programs stay resident in memory, intercept some
interrupts and DOS functions and monitor them for dangerous activities
(like modification of an executable file and so on). However, due to
the total lack of memory protection under MS-DOS, a clever virus is
able to disable the monitoring program if it detects it in memory, or
even invoce the "dangerous" functions in a way that cannot be
intercepted (e.g., using CALLs to the ROM BIOS). Virus which are able
to do this are called "tunnelling", since they are able to bypass the
monitoring programs just as the electrons are able to bypass an
energetic barrier (the "tunnelling effect"). If correctly implemented,
these techniques are able to bypass -any- monitoring program, and
therefore the monitoring programs (like FliShot+) are the weakest
line in the anti-virus defense (even weaker than the scanners).

Available - yes. Used by Joe Users and relied entirely on them (as
some people are relying entirely on SCAN) - definitively not.
Currently the anti-virus researchers are the only software producers
that must also support the product of their competitors... Have you
thought how many times McAfee or Frisk had to answer the question why
they are detecting CPAV as a virus?

The latter is the attitude that I am proposing. Anybody who is
competent enough to use a heuristic scanner should know about the
potential problems and not ask silly questions...

As an IBM employee, you should know that the product mentioned above
are restricted to IBM Internal Use Only and not generally available to
the rest of the world (except VIRSCAN). It's a pity, though, since
VSTOP seemed pretty good to me the last time I saw it...

It's really amazing then that the Polish SF writer Stanislav Lem
described in his novel "Peace to the Earth" (in 1984) the possible use
of computer viruses as warfare... The description looks rather
realistic and naturally follows from his early ideas about machine
evolution guided by natural selection first expressed in "The
Invincible"...

I wish the people who market anti-virus software had the same
exactness of expression... :-) Indeed, there are integrity checkers
that are already able to defeat all current and -probably- -most- of
the future viruses, if they are used correctly... Yet the marketing
people are constantly trying to convince us that their product defeats
ALL POSSIBLE viruses, including ANY possible future ones... You
understand very well that this is, of course, impossible...

Yep, but they differ in how often are they able to actually repair the
file... The ASP IT succeeds more often, since it relies on on-line
- -backups- (but needs more space), while another product that has been
discussed here recently (The Untouchable) succeeds less often (but
takes -much- less space), since it store only some information about
the files. Recently Dr. Solomon told me the idea to reach a compromise
- - to allow the user to specify how much of the file should be saved.
If it is 100 % this is equivalent to the on-line backups; if it is a
few bytes from the entry point this is equivalent to UT. Each user
should be able to specify the ratio to a value that meets his/her
feelings of "safety".
