Subject: report on virus detection (PC)

Hello everybody,

August this year I completed a report on virus detection. This report
was the result of my traineeship at the Dutch National Criminal
Intelligence Center (CRI). The abstract of the report reads as
follows:

               An  evaluation  of  different  techniques  for  virus
               detection. The discussion is sufficiently general  to
               be  applicable to a  substantial number  of computing
               platforms.  All mentioned  practical  issues  concern
               the MS  DOS  operating  system.  Improvement  of  the
               operating   system   is   presented   as   the   most
               fundamental  and therefore  effective way  to  tackle
               the virus problem.

I have produced an ASCII version of the report, which should now be
available for interested readers, through anonymous ftp at
ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de, in the directory
pub/virus/texts/viruses The filename is virusdet.zip.

Any constructive criticism concerning the contents of the report is
welcome at my e-mail address.

Well, the understanding of the word "fascinating virus" is subjective,
of course, but for me this virus has one very interesting property -
it is able to repair itself from random errors, using a Hamming
self-correcting code.

Hi there,

I do not know if this newsgroup is the right one for my posting.  but
anyway, I got together with a couple of friend last weekend, after a
long talk, mostly about computer. We came across to the virus topic.
One of them mention about this anti virus program called 'NOVI anti
virus', this one suppose need no upgrage, because the program can
upgrade themself. in other term, NOVI can find a new viruses and kill
it.  Out from my curiosity, I would like to know, if this anti virus
program really work.  If anybody know, or use it before. Please
e-mail.  thanks in advance.

Subject: CPAV false positives (was FLIP) (PC)

Unfortunately this is a fairly well known false positive.  Central
Point does not encrypt their signature search strings, either on disk
or in memory.  Therefore, wherever CPAV uses the same search string as
other scanners (as in the case of FLIP), CPAV will be identified as
being infected.  If you run the TSR scanner portion of CPAV and then
use another scanner, you will also find the "infection" in memory.

Incidentally, further to Microsoft's inclusion of portions of CPAV in
MS-DOS version 6, someone who has seen a beta copy indicates that
VSAFE will be included.  Fortunately, VSAFE is the activity monitor
portion, and does not do any signature scanning.

Obviously there won't be a 100% complete.  :) But, according to the
FAQ for this group, for instance, it says that the catalogs at
informatik.de are incomplete for the IBM listings...is there a more
complete version?
   Your F-Prot database, for instance, is pretty close to what I am
looking for, but in a public-domain listing.

I realized afterwords that this was not really a good question, but it
was too late to edit the article after I sent it.  :) I meant, can it
be removed by disinfectant software, or must it be replaced?  This is,
however, essentially irrelevant, since the best "cure" for an
infection is to *always* replace the offending files with clean
backups.  So just ignore this one.  :)

Both are wrong - What F-PROT is really detecting are virus signatures
left in memory by the Central Point programs.  The same applies to
several other anti-virus programs - they produce false alarms on the
Central Point anti- virus software.

PLEASE, PLEASE read the CPAV manual.  It specifically states that CPAV
is not compatible with other anti-virus programs. The problem is
really that CPAV contains various virus signatures, and unlike any
decent anti-virus program, it does not bother to encrypt them.

If you use CPAV, don't use any other anti-virus program.

(or better....don't use CPAV :-)....)

Some time back, virus scanner comparison data was posted to this

halucinating. I would really appreciate it if some kind soul would
either re-post it or point me to an ftp site containing the

A virus has shown up in Tasmania, Australia, which we haven't seen
reported before, and which isn't known by name to F-Prot 205 or TBScan
43 (although they both pick it up by heuristics).

We have only analysed it far enough to get its name and an ID
string;  we don't know potential damage.

Name: Larry on a Screen
Infects: .EXE & .COM files  (at least)
.COM files grow by 491 bytes, .EXE files by 403 bytes (or so it
seems on samples of one of each)

Signature strings: "Larry on a Screen"

Subject: How trojans work. (PC)

Hello, My name is Andy Hardison and I am a BBS sysop with a problem.
I was notified by a user of a program that scanned clean, but when
run, caused a Michaelangelo infection.

Here is what I was told, Xyphr.zip was unzipped to form the game
files, Xyphr.exe, .dat, etc.  When trying to run Xyphr, the computer
would hang.  My user rebooted the computer with a CTRL-ALT-DEL.  Since
he thought it was a memory problem, he ran Quarterdecks Manifest, mft.
He thought he was running MFT.exe, but there was a 300 or so byte
MFT.com file present.

He typed in MFT and his computer locked up again.  Upon a second
reboot, with an actual powerdown, the computer lost some files.  He
scanned with Fprot and McAfee.  Both reported Michaelangelo in the
boot track.

Could someone out there explain to me how Michaelangelo could have
gotten onto the system via this method of infection.  My user is more
paranoid about virii than I am (I scan all incoming files, but do not
run the executables).  He did not have an infected computer before
running Xyphr, but did after the above mentioned sequence of events.
Any help would be appreciated.

The explaination of the FLIP report by Henry Tindall of ankar2.af.mil
was an excellent example of conflicts between different Anti-Viral
products when cross testing files although other conflicts arise when
different Anti-Viral products are run consecutively due to testing
residue in system memory of which we believe to be the case in the
TELECOM report by F-Prot which led us to the discovery of these
residue conflicts.  The following are the results of the testing of
a Norton Disk Doctor undo file from the removal of the STONED virus
from a floppy disk.  Similar results can be achieved using any file
and various products run consecutively without cold rebooting to a
clean dos between tests.
Norton Anti-Virus           Nothing
Virex                       Possible Stoned Dropper
ViruScan                    Nothing
Central Point Anti-Virus    Nothing
F-Prot                      Signs of Cascade in Memory
F-Prot                      Signs of Telecom in Memory
Integrity Master            P1 active in Memory
Virex                       Stoned Active in Memory
Scan                        Nothing

The initial Virex result is a correct result, although the others
are semi-correct in their own ways.  Since it is almost impossible
for Anti-Virus developers to test for these types of inconsistancies
it makes it very important to cold boot between Anti-Virus Tests.
I hope to have full testing results available within the next month
for all interested parties.

Subject: A less virus prone architecture

I was reading a book on the Babbage analytica engine the other day,
and it occurred to me that a Babbage machine may be less virus prone,
then a Von Neuman machine.

A Babbage machine differs from a Von Neuman machine, in that its
program is external stored on a medium separate from the data store of
the machine. Thus the operands of a program are in store, but the
program that transforms them is not. The Babbage analytic engine was
patterned after the Jacquard Loom.

The question I put is this. Is a computer, in which the program is
stored in a totally separate memory space from data, less prone to
virus attack or not.

I would appreciate your opinions on this question.

I have myself disassembled 1963 completely. Simultaneously, in my
contacts with Patricia Hoffman I came into conclusion that she is not
able even to -read- the well-commented virus disassemblies sent to
her, let alone to disassemble a virus herself. Sorry, but I will even

Because I saw a claim which I knew was wrong, so I decided to post a
correction, in order to prevent the readers from getting false
knowledge about this particular virus. I definitively do not consider
this a "wasted bandwidth".

No, this exactly what it does not provide. It might have been useful
when SCAN used to identify viruses better, since then VSUM contained
the name that SCAN gave to the particular virus. Nowadays SCAN is
completely useless for virus identification and the virus names in
VSUM do not have even this value.

There is nothing in VSUM that really helps you identify which virus
you have. No virus maps for exact identification. No cross-reference
between the names that the different products use. No correct
technical information. Even such basic information, as the virus
infective length is sometimes wrong. Several of the listed viruses do
not exist (I know, I have the files appropriate files from Patti's
collection). Several viruses are listed twice or more times, under
different names - and curiously - with different properties. For most
viruses it is said "It is not know what the virus does besides
replicate" - even for those viruses, for which the name suggests what
they are doing...

My (wild) guess is that the information in VSUM is a combination of
what Mrs. Hoffman has been told about the virus and what she has
observed when running the virus on a sacrificial system.

Well, I wrote "I think", didn't I? I was not sure, because I didn't

Huh, as far as I remember, the question what exactly represents a
threat has not been mentioned neither in your message, nor in my
reply. You were just listing a few methods how to determine whether
what you have is really a virus or not, and I pointed out that in some
cases it doesn't work. That's all.

In this case I am not speaking about the users - they don't have to
bother with all those "unknown" files from our collection. I am
speaking about us, and we -are- both good assembly language
programmers and able to disassemble a virus. Gosh, we are doing this
all the time; we are even teaching the students how to do it... My
point was that it is a lot of work - for us - to disassemble all those
files. And this work is low-priority, because we have to deal with
lots of viruses every day that -do- replicate perfectly...

Your suggested technique sounded (to me, at least) as a general
approach for dealing with viruses. It is indeed useful as such, it
just needs to be updated and refined, what I believed to do with my
message. Sorry for any misunderstanding.

I strongly disagree with you here. To constantly bring up new
"research" techniques here definitively has a beneficial effect. Here
is one example. The Dir_II virus is -extremely- spread in Bulgaria.
More than 90% of the requests for help to my Lab there are for this
virus - they have documented statistics about this. Yet, I made a lot
of fuss about this virus here, so now most of the popular scanners are
able to detect it (McAfee's CLEAN can even remove it), and we
succeeded to prevent the wide spread of this virus in the West.

Second example. I made a lot of fuss about the MtE, so not several
scanners are able to detect it. When I was in Bulgaria this summer, I
met a virus writer and asked him whether he intends to use the MtE.
The answer was "Why bother, even McAfee can detect it!". The truth is
that SCAN does not detect the MtE reliably, but so what... The
important thing is that we prevented a wave of MtE-based viruses.

My Lab in Bulgaria is basically the only official anti-virus
supporting team in Bulgaria and they have almost half a million of PCs
in that country. This, combined with the fact that several people
consider writing and/or releasing a virus there to be some kind of
entertainment, leads to some unexpected results...

For instance, I have seen myself Anti-Pascal.605 in the wild -
combined with Cascade. If you have ever disassembled this extremely
stupid virus, you'll understand my surprise.

Also, can you believe that I spent almost a week hunting for Kamikaze
- - a silly overwriting virus that should never spread at all? (I
finally nailed it using an integrity checker, but this is another
story, which I could tell you if you are interested.)

No disagreement here, although we probably interpret the above
sentence differently...

The above is, of course, true, but it also holds for any program, not
just for viruses. It is not possible to write a perfect program, which
will not damage anything in any conditions, just because of the
reasons that you are listing. Some such "imperfect" programs are
significantly more widespread that some of the "research" viruses.
:-) The only advantage is that they don't replicate by themselves and
do not try to run on your computer without your permission...

(Note: I am not advocating the writing of "harmless" viruses, I am
just observing a fact.)

Calling MagMac a "data virus" disturbs me. I thought that the
definition of a data virus was a virus which is transported as a
non-executable and which is then transformed into an executable virus
when the file is used. This is a bit of a semantic clash, as I
understand the definition vs. the actual XCMD mechanism.

HyperCard XCMDs are executable resources of arbitrary function written
by a programmer in C or Pascal (masochists may use assembler, if they
wish).  They are installed as XCMD resources into a stack and provide
an extension to the normal command set provided in HyperCard
"scripts".

The phrase "arbitrary function" is the key here. The XCMD can provide
any function that a Macintosh application can; the viral XCMD was
simply a section of code which added another executable resource to
the System file.  There was no transformation of data into program;
all viral code was present inside the XCMD itself. Any HyperCard stack
containing the XCMD could have been used to spread the virus, simply
by invoking the XCMD by name.

I speculate that the stack was used as a vector because it took less
time to throw a "teaser" Trojan stack together that it would have to
make a throw-away application which would have been sufficiently
tantalizing to get people to download it.

Now, there have been true HyperTalk viruses, in which HyperCard
scripts were written to infect other stacks with the viral script, but
this really isn't a data virus either, because the virus is still an
executable program of sorts.

The closest thing I've seen to a real "data virus" were the "implied
loader" viruses, which subverted a Finder datafile into becoming a
means of replacing part of the System simply because the Finder opened
them.  But this still required an executable resource be present.

I don't think we've really seen a virus which transforms itself from
the executable to the non-executable realm yet. I emphasize "yet".
