Whoa, hang on there! I'm afraid your paper has got it wrong.
Michelangelo uses 2K of memory, but not all machines will report
655,360 bytes free if you remove your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT.

In vanilla IBM PS/2's, and some other types of machines, there is a
rather obscure area of memory called the EBDA (short for Extra BIOS
Data Area) which normally uses 1K, and consequently will cause the
machines to report only 639K free. (If anyone's interested, I have a
short program to detect whether an EBDA is installed, and would be
glad to mail it to anyone who wants it or stick it on an archive site
somewhere (source included).)

If your machines are reporting only 638K free, then there is cause for
concern.  EBDA's normally only use 1K, so there could well be
something interfering with your memory. I'd recommend scanning your
system with a decent virus protection package. If that says your
machines are clean, then it's probably something else that's
interfering with the total memory.

As regards newspaper reports - it's very easy to jump to all-too-hasty
conclusions simply because journalists (who, let's face it, are _not_
generally virus gurus :-) write articles that are either wrong or
misleading. In all cases it's advisable to treat such reports with
caution.

Subject: Virus-PC problems (PC)

In the rush to protect against the attack of Michelangelo, I have been
busy installing several anti-virus software packages on the computers
on campus.  I have VIREX-PC 2.1 installed on my Zenith 286 and have
experienced a strange situation and wonder if anyone can help.

I was scanning my C: drive from a clean, bootable VIREX disk and
interrupted it in the middle of the scan.  Then I rebooted my system
and got the message KYLIE virus detetected in memory, reboot from a
clean floppy.  Well, I just rebooted from the hard drive, because I
was in a hurry.  Now when I do a diskcopy, the copy finishes up and
hangs my system.  The copy seems to work ok.  I've scanned the
floppies and can not find a virus (I've used VIREX 2.1, CPAV 1.1, and
McAffe's Viruscan 86B.)  Is this a virus or am I paranoid and just
have a hardware problem?

People have stated that you can check for MA by doing a CHKDSK, and if
it comes back with 653,312 instead of 655,360 as the Total bytes of
Memory, then you are infected.  Now for my question:

	If the 655,360 is the total amount of memory, how can MA effect this
	count?  I could see it effecting the total bytes free but not the
	Total amount.  If I am wrong or there is something I am missing

Hi Folks,

I would like to know if there is a list of viruses some place.  I
would like to know the name of the virus, what it does, how one gets
it, and what machine it will infect. (IBM PC, Mac, others) An FTP site
would be the best. I have looked on cert.sei.cmu.edu, but that only
has people talking about different viruses.  I would really like to
have a compiled list.

I don't know if this would be related, but I came across something that
might be really similar.  I ran McAfee's Scan (v84) and found both
Stoned and Michaelangelo on the HD.  I ran clean (V84) first for the
Stoned, and then for the Mich, but when I ran scan a second time,
Michaelangelo was still there!  I then tried version 86B of McAfee's
scan & clean, but still no change.  the HD was still there, and so was
Mich.

I have a question here.  I know it's possible for a program to spin up
a floppy drive and test for if a floppy has been inserted.  I was
wondering if there was any such utility out there, that say, returns
an error level, so that I can do a "testflop a:" and if there is one
in there, run my disk checking software.  I have a public-access lab
for students, and between 3-4 HUNDRED students come through there each
day!  If such a utility could be found/created whatever, I'm sure
automation of this process will certainly help keep our systems clean!

Ok, it's time someone figure out what the common link is, with all
these major (and not-so-major) respected corporations shipping
Michelangelo.  WHO DID THEY GET IT FROM?  I can see only three
possibilities: 1. a well- planned and executed conspiracy, involving
dozens of individuals with inside connections in various industries,
2. a "demo disk" they were all stupid enough to try without being
extremely careful, or 3. some corporation each of them respects even
more, and each of them relies on.

I doubt the conspiracy thing: the virus is too stupid.  And 2. and 3.
reduce to the same thing, because only a demo from a well-respected
corporation would be trusted to that extent.

Subject: Michelangelo and PC dates; another problem (PC)

There has been some discussion of whether it is a good idea to avoid
Michelangelo etc. simply by resetting the system clock.  I agree that it
isn't.

However, one of the main reasons hasn't been mentioned: How many
casual PC users have the right date set on their machines?  If it is
an AT clone, the date stamp depends on the condition of the batteries.
In my experience, the date stamp will be affected long before the
batteries are bad enough that the CMOS setup is lost, especially if
the PC is always left on.  I continually find myself looking at (other
people's) machines that are off a day or more.

I wonder how many people who were planning to just leave the PC turned
off tomorrow and avoid the whole problem, are sitting there today looking
at trashed hard drives?

An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, IMnsHO.

Subject: Stoned and No-Int on same 5.25 disk? (PC)

Recently I had to disinfect a disk that Scan 86B said had Stoned and
No-INT on it.  What I am wondering is if it is possible to have both
viruses on the same disk and if so, why would CLEAN not get rid of the
No-INT virus?

Am I correct to think that there was really only 1 virus but SCAN was
incorrect to note that there were 2?  If so, then that would explain
why CLEAN would not be able to clean BOTH viruses.

Any hints???

This is not correct. There is a signal coming from the power supply
called "Power Good". This directly drives the /RESET (active-low reset)
pin on the the CPU chip.

The reset switch simply grounds this line. None of the power output

If you want to be *absolutly sure* that you've wiped out everything

From:    JJ Merelo <jmerelo@ugr.es>
Subject: Surprised by the spreading of Mich (PC)

Well, as we all know, Michelangelo is a boot-sector infector. Thus,
the only way of getting infected by it is by booting with an (already
infected) system diskette, or having a non-system diskette in the
bootable drive when the computer is switched on.

Then, my question is:

That many people has done that?

I mean, if you get a mouse driver floppy infected, you don't usually
power up your computer with that mouse driver floppy. You only power
it up, and boot it from floppy, when you have original system disks.
In this way, pro- bably 90% of the people may have got infected with
original system disks.

There are also other disks that require to be booted, instead of
simply get copied onto the hard disk and executed, or being executed
after a setup pro- gram. But these are *very few*.

And, maybe by mistake (as you don't usually have a disk in boot drive
when you power up), the remaining 10% of the people may have got
infected by powering up with a non-bootable disk in boot drive.

Then, once again, I don't understand how so many people has got
infected if they had not the infection already on the systems disks.
So, who's distributing infected systems disks, and from when?

From my own experience, I know that virus like Stoned or Brain or
anti-tel do not pose much danger, unless they get into a game disk
that requires users to boot from it. Nowadays, games that can be put
into only a disk are, again, very few, and when Stoned came here, only
very few people caught it. The same goes for Anti-tel, and I know
about maybe one who got Brain. By the way, I don't know about anybody
around here who has got Mich, although a short notice about it has
been run on national and regional TVs. By the way, the dude on
national TV said that write-protected diskettes had nothing to fear
from viri.  But he was a "suit" (see "Hacker's Dictionary")....

Sure there is but did I say that you had to STOP with 10 bytes ? I look at
it this way:

If we can eliminate nearly all the current viruses (an crudely hacked
varients) as a threat and start from ground zero now, isn't that a win ?

If we can eliminate an entire vector of viruses so that the virus-writers
actually have to put some thought into their creations, isn't that a
win ?

If we can make it so much more difficult to write a virus that the casual
14-year-old does not even try any more isn't that a win ?

Besides, the purpose of that "standard" way is to check things that all
sucessful viruses have HAD to change to be successful. The simple fact
is that DOS is not "riddled" with holes, rather there are a finite number
of ways a virus can spread and these can ALL be handled from the OS &
easier than I can with add-ons.

Sure, there will be the possibility of directed attacks - I have already
been around a few times with viruses specifically directed at DiskSecure
(guess that's an honor of sorts 8*). But in each case DOS level
validation that the checkers were intact took care of the problem (and
is the purpose of the trivial CHKSMBR.EXE program - to check on SafeMBR in
the MBR). Could I defeat it ? Sure: I know all of the checks that are made,
(not in 512 bytes though) but in an OS, the installation process could
generate a unique signature for each installation & at this point (see my
discussion with Ross Greenberg about many simple agorithms (April 1990 ? -
Anthony ?)) a virus might infect one machine but not the one next to it -
at least not easily.

The bottom line is that it is time we took the offensive against the
virus-writers before a really professional one comes along (haven't seen
any yet). It is a fight that I really believe we can win and the OS/BIOS
is my choice of ground.

Subject: How to start disinfecting service?

     After seeing the wide-spread panic caused by the Michelangelo
Virus, I'm considering the idea of starting some sort of virus
'extermination' service locally.  However, I don't intend to violate
any laws on use of virus scanning programs.  Also, I'm just a
college student who is barely making it, so funds are important.

     I've already contacted the local McAfee Representative, and he
says there is something like an $850 fee for two years of being a
licensed McAfee distributer.  Of course, this is way out of my price
range.  I also realize McAfee is the "high-end" of the virus
elimination packages.

     My question is then, what are some of the other requirements
and/or fees that other virus protection companies charge for allowing
a business to use and distribute thier software?  Although the basic
'distribution' is free, the using of the software as a business can
and will cause problems if I just 'do it' without some sort of
authentication.

     Any information along this line would be helpful and appreciated.

This is starting to make me mad. While Scanning is sort-of effective
for generic use by home users that have every possible combination of
hardware, OS, and software and who may be already infected. It is
ludicrous to hear of a manufacturer, especially a major one relying on
it alone for distribution disks. For some time now, whenever I send
out a disk, I know exactly what is on the disk (even CHKDSK will tell
you how much space is used and I know how big my programs are), and it
has my own virus-checking boot record in the first sector (again easy
to check).

Given this, a validatable gold-standard master is possible (an
algorithmic checksum of the ENTIRE disk is fast & easy) and
statistical sampling (common to any manufacturing process) would
quickly reveal any deviation and require NO updates (just
intelligence).

IMHO, it sounds like Intel spends more time validating their chips
than their software. Would you buy an anti-virus product from this
man?
