Subject: WARNING - Michelangelo Virus (PC)

     From all reports this destructive virus is spreading  world-
wide  very rapidly. Unlike the DataCrime "fizzle" in  1989  which
contained  similar destructive capability but never  spread,  the
Michelangelo  appears to have become "common" in just ten  months
following  detection. I have encountered three cases  locally  in
just the last few weeks.

     Three factors make this virus particularly dangerous:

1) The virus uses similar techniques as the "STONED" virus  which
     while first identifies in early 1988 remains the most common
     virus  currently reported. Since the virus infects only  the
     Master  Boot  Record on hard disks and the  boot  record  of
     floppy  disks,  viral  detection  techniques  that  rely  on
     alteration  of  DOS  executable files will  not  detect  the
     virus. Similarly, techniques that monitor the status of  the
     MBR  may only provide users with a single warning  that,  if
     execution is permitted to continue, may not be repeated.

2) Michelangelo  was  first  discovered  in  Europe  in  mid-1991
     consequently many virus scanners in use today will not  pick
     up the virus unless more recent updates have been obtained.

3)  Unlike  the Stoned and Jerusalem (the most common viruses  in
     the  past)  which  are more  annoying  than  dangerous,  the
     Michelangelo  virus will, on its trigger date of March  6th,
     attempt to overwrite vital areas of the hard disk  rendering
     it  unreadable  by  DOS.  Further,  since  the  FATs   (file
     allocation  tables)  may  be damaged ,  unless  backups  are
     available  recovery  will  be  very  difficult  and  require
     someone  who is able to rebuild a corrupt FAT (also  a  very
     time-consuming process).

     Fortunately,  the  Michelangelo virus is also very  easy  to
detect:  when resident in a PC, the CHKDSK (included with  MS-DOS
(Microsoft),  PC-DOS  (IBM), and DR-DOS (Digital  Research)  {all
names  are  registered by their owners}) program  will  return  a
"total  bytes  memory" value 2048 bytes lower than  normal.  This
means that a 640k PC which normally returns 655,360 "total  bytes
memory"  will  report  653,312.  While  a  low  value  will   not
necessarily mean that Michelangelo or any other virus is present,
the PC should be examined by someone familiar with viral activity
to determine the reason.

     If the Michelangelo virus is found, the PC should be  turned
off  until  disinfected  properly. All  floppy  disks  and  other
machines  in  the  area should then also be  examined  since  the
Michelangelo virus is spread in the boot record (executable  area
found on all floppy disks including data-only disks).

We have just been infected by the Kennedy virus.  McAfee's SCANV85

Subject: UK mag (PC Fun) distributes Stoned (PC)

Following all the reports we've had of hardware and software vendors
distributing virus infected diskettes or programs, the following was
reported in my local paper this morning.

It is, perhaps, interesting to note the degree of _accuracy_ in this
report.  On matters of fact I only noted three errors, and these are
all minor to trivial (and all in the same paragraph - dare I hazard
suggesting that this accuracy is at the price of content?)

From: The Press, Christchurch, NZ, 16/2/92, p.9

Free disk proves a flop             - NZPA,   London.

A New Zealand computer virus has embarrassed organisers of a British
magazine promotion in which 18,000 floppy disks were offered free to
readers.

Each January issue of "PC Fun" included a giveaway disk, but the editor,
Mr Adrian Pumphrey, siad the "Stoned" virus was found to have
infilitrated the batch.

"It is bad news,' he said.  "The magazines had already been on the
shelves for two weeks before the virus was discovered."

The virus - which prints out the message "Your PC is now stoned" -
originated at Victoria University in Wellington about five years ago.

A computer expert, Dr Alan Solomon, who was consulted by "PC Fun",
described the virus as extremely common, but said it was a nuisance more
than anything else.

"We first saw it in Britain in 1988 and it is now probably the commonest
virus here.  It is certainly the commonest virus in New Zealand.

"It is not terribly seruious; more an annoyance and a nuisance."

However, he said computer users still had to get rid of it.  This was so
as not to pass it on and because, in some rare instances, it could lead
to loss of data.

"It will have been a real pain for `PC Fun'," Dr Solomon said.  "But the
virus is quite easy to get rid of if you do it right."

For those of you still attempting to track the spread of the DIR-II, I
had a configmed report yesterday of a single machine infected in the
country of Jordan.  The actual path of infection is unknown at this
time.  As most should know by now, DIR-II is not at all dangerous (
(relatively), but does spread rapidly and is a bit of a curiosity.
Removal is simple using only DOS commands....

First of all, if all it did were to *detect* known and unknown virus-
es, there would be nothing new in that.  The whole point is that it
can also *restore* the original file in almost every case where the
modification is due to a virus.
  Actually, your question was answered here a month ago.  I'll repeat
the first part:

>>  Untouchable consists of three modules.  The main one, UT, is an

Additional comments:
  1. When I said "overwriting viruses", I was referring to those which
overwrite program code.  It turns out that Ver. 1.0 also doesn't work
on viruses which overwrite stack space, such as ZeroHunt and Lehigh,
but I'm told that the next version will.  I have not yet found any
other virus on which it doesn't work.
  2. The program will *never* restore a file incorrectly since it
compares the checksum of the restored file with that of the original
one.

Subject: Joshi virus removal with FDISK /MBR (PC)

We have a group of 4 computer labs that often get JOSHI. On a lot of these
machines we couldn't get rid of JOSHI on the hard drives. We tries CLEANv84,
F-prot 2.01, CPAV, and NAV with no luck. (it did work on a few machines)

We would:
- - Cold boot with a clean write protected floppy
- - Clean the hard drive
- - Cold boot with a clean floppy again
- - Scan and find JOSHI still there

The machines are a mix of 8088, 286, 386sx. MS-DOS 3.30 and 4.01.

We had to low-level format the drives to clean them and restore from our clean
backups.

We finally solved the problem by using IBM-DOS 5.0 FDISK /MBR even with MS-DOS
3.30 and 4.01 on the hard drives.

The lab supervisor is very happy now.

	This brings up an interesting problem. Can it happen via a
serial / parallel port? This would mean there has to be direct control
over the CPU from a device attached to the port. Usually there is
software driving the IO of the port, but can an device sieze control
and send instructions without driving software? Now if this isn't
possible then I can see that it would be impossible.  But just saying
NO because it's on a chip is nonsense. There is nothing saying I cant
place an EPROM in a strategic place that will place a virus of my
choice on a hard drive or floppy, OR DO ANYTHING without even striking
a key. If that chip has code to blank the screen, it will be blank
before any control is given the user.  (how do you think a PC knows
where to look for DOS Startup Code -- hardware)

Subject: QEMM386's LOADHI with VSHIELD1 and/or VIRSTOP (PC)

I've noticed that you can use Quarterdeck's QEMM386 and LOADHI to load
VSHIELD1.EXE in high memory, as well as FPROT's VIRSTOP.EXE, but you
can't load VSHIELD.EXE high (so far as I'm aware).  My questions are:

1)  When you load these two small anti-viral programs high, do they still
work?

2)  I noticed that when I tried loading both VSHIELD1.EXE and VIRSTOP.EXE
they seem to load okay back to back.  In this case, what happens when they
*both* detect a virus at the same time?  Will they detect it?  Is their
any percentage in configuring like this (you've mentioned that you should
always use more than one virus checker, whenever possible).

3)  Why can't you load VSHIELD.EXE high, or can you?  Will it still work?

Many thanks for your guidance!

No need for that. Just run DOS 5.0 FDISK with the (undocumented) /MBR
option, and you'll get the same results as with M-DISK and even
better.

Are there any virus detectors for unix?  The PC's in our company are

In case it matters we are running Suns, IBM R/S-6000's, and a few

Subject: Gulf War Virus & "Softwar"

Regarding the Gulf War virus: Anyone remember the book "Softwar", by
Thierry Breton and Denis Beneich? Came out in 1984. Been a while since
I read it, goes something like this: The U.S. allows the Soviets to
buy a super-computer. The chips were, uh, slightly modified. Or
something like that. You can guess the rest. Fair reading as I recall.

Too bad the Gulf War version seems to an April Fool's story. (We
coulda had a sequel to the book!)

Subject: Reviews and request (PC + Amiga)

per recent requests for reviews, the following is my current list (in 
order):
EliaShim's ViruSafe
Worldwide's Vaccine
Solomon AntiVirus Toolkit
Sophos Vaccine
Fifth Generation's Untouchable

(Of course, any more rumours like this past week, and this could be 
delayed a long time.)

Now, a request.  We haven't heard much from the Amiga people lately.  Can 
I get some feedback on the top Amiga antiviral shareware of recent date?

Subject: "Desert Storm" viral myths

This was pretty much forced on me by the press.  There have also been a 
lot of messages on the topic in alt.folklore.computers.

                      "Desert Storm" viral myths

The recent spate of reports of a virus which shut down Iraq's air
defence system during "Desert Shield/Storm" seems to have started with
the series "Triumph Without Victory: The Unreported History of the
Persian Gulf War" by U. S. News and World Report.  The articles are
being rerun in many papers (as well, apparently, as CNN and ABC
Nightline), and the article on the virus run in my local paper is
specifically credited to USN&WR.  The bare bones of the article are that
a French printer was to be smuggled into Iraq through Jordan, that US
agents intercepted the printer, replaced a microchip in the printer with
one reprogrammed by the NSA, that a virus on the reprogrammed chip
invaded the air defence network to which the printer was connected and
erased information on display screens when "windows" were opened for
additional information on aircraft.

The first question is: could a chip in a printer send a virus?  Doesn't
a printer just accept data?

Both parallel/Centronics and serial RS-232 ports are bidirectional. 
(Cabling is not always, and I well remember having to deal, in the early
days of PCs, with serial ports which had been used as printer ports, and
could not be used as modem ports because the "return" pin had been
sheared off, a common  practice to "fix" balky printers.)  However, the
"information" which comes back over the line is concerned strictly with
whether or not the printer is ready to accept more data.  It is never
accepted as a program by the "host".

The case of "network" printers, is somewhat more complex.  There are two
possible cases: network printer servers and "network printers (such as
the Mac Laserwriters): and they are quite distinct.  The print server
(on, say, DECnet) is actually a networked computer acting as a print
server; accepting files from other network sources and spooling them to
a printer. True, this computer/printer combo is often referred to simply
as a printer,  but it would not, in any case, be able to submit programs
to other hosts on  the net.  The Mac case is substantially different,
since the Mac laser printers are attached as "peers".  Mac Laserwriters,
at least, do have the ability to submit programs to other computers on
the network, and one Mac virus uses the Laserwriter as a vector. 
However, it is unlikely that the Iraqi air defence system was Mac based,
and few other systems see printers as peers.

Second question: if it *was* possible to send some kind of program from
the printer to the computer system/network, was it a virus?

Given the scenario, of a new printer coming into an existing system, any
damaging program would pretty much have had to have been a virus.  In a
situation like that, the first thing to do when the system malfunctions
after a new piece of equipment has been added is to take out the new
part.  Unless the "chip" could send out a program which could survive,
in the network or system, by itself, the removal of the printer would
solve the problem.

Third question:  could a virus, installed on a chip, and entered into
the air defence computer system, have done what it was credited with?

Coming from the popular press, "chip" could mean pretty much anything,
so my initial reaction that the program couldn't be large enough to do
much damage means little.  However, the programming task involved would
be substantial.  The program would first have to run on the
printer/server/peripheral, in order to get itself transferred to the
host.  The article mentions that a peripheral was used in order to
circumvent normal security measures, but all systems have internal
security measures as well in order to prevent a printer from "bringing
down" the net.  The program would have to be able to run/compile or be
interpreted on the host, and would thus have to know what the host was,
and how it was configured.  The program would then have to know exactly
what the air defence software was, and how it was set up to display the
information.  It would also have to be sophisticated enough in avoiding
detection that it could masquerade as a "bug" in the software, and
persistent enough that it could avoid elimination by the reloading of
software which would immediately take place in such a situation.

The Infoworld AF/91 prank article has been mentioned as the "source" for
the USN&WR virus article.  There was, however,  another article, quite
seriously presented in a French military aerospace magazine in February
(which possibly prompted the Infoworld joke.)  This earlier article
stated that a virus had been developed which would prevent Exocet
missiles, which the French had sold to Iraq, from impacting on French
ships in the area.  The author used a mix of technobabble and unrelated
facts, somehow inferring from the downloading of weather data at the
last minute before launch, the programmability of targets on certain
missiles and the radio destruct sequences used in testing that such a
"virus" was possible.

It has also been rumoured, and by sources who should know, that the US
military has sent out an RFP on the use of computer viri as computer
weapons.  Although I have not seen the request, I *do* believe it went
out, and we have confirmation in the report of a contract being awarded
for further study in that area.  I *don't* believe in the USN&WR report.
