Subject: Michelangelo down south (way down south!) (PC)

If anyone is keeping track of Michelangelo's geographical spread, it
may be of interest to know that it has appeared in Argentina. I've
found one of my group's computers infected, and apparently it has
surfaced in several other sites in the country.

I couldn't find the vector, but the machine in question is accessible to
a large number of persons. Argentina is also a haven for pirates, so it
is not surprising.

I used F-Prot 2.02D to detect it and clean it. Nice program!

This is incorrect.  In the "Scan" window select "Files:" and then
select either "All files" or "<User-specified>".  This is not normally
necessary, however.  No, a virus cannot hide in a text file.  The
virus has to be in a file that will at some point be executed.  There
are some types of files, however, that are not normally checked by
virus scanners, but can be infected.  The .BGI graphics device driver
files used by the various compilers from Borland Intl. contain
executable code, and are, in fact, essentially overlays, but no virus
scanner I've seen checks them by default.  You can, however, tell all
of the good ones additional extensions that you want checked.  The
good ones include F-Prot and McAffee's Scan.

F-PROT 202D has indicated "SBC virus found" on a couple of machines.
There is no info with F-PROT that describes an SBC virus.  I noticed
that there is information regarding an "SVC" virus.

Is there an SBC virus?  If so, where can I find a description of it?

If not, why does F-PROT indicate that SBC is found?

   The subject should ask about "Marking Read-Only" instead of "Write
Protection."  Marking files as RO will stop only a very few very
stupid viruses.  Do not rely on it.  However, it will stop those few
viruses and will also stop the accidental deletion of any executables
so marked.  There's nothing wrong with doing it IN ADDITION to making
frequent backups and scanning and checksumming your files.  The only
program I've encountered which minds being marked RO is the Tempra
paint program that came with my Paradise SVGA card, which forgets its
configuration info, presumably because it can't open its executable to
read it.  Of course, any programs which WRITE to their executables
will have to be marked Read-Write, at least while installing or
configuring them.
   As long as you remember that most viruses will just flag the file
as writable, infect it, and then restore its attributes, there's no
harm in obtaining this extra protection.  But don't let it replace the
other methods of protection.  By itself, it does very, very little.

Is there a list of the known viruses and what they do anywhere?

Not just Michaelangelo will destroy the disk (like it says on TV), but

Michelangelo doesn't seem to make any attempt to hide itself on the
disk (although it makes a primative attempt to hide in memory).  Many
viruses, however, _do_ hide.

In general, Michelangelo and the other boot sector viruses do not come
from executable programs.  Most boot sector viruses are spread by
leaving an infected disk in the floppy drive, which activates the
virus.

However, some file infecting viruses, can contain a boot sector
payload and copy it onto the boot sector (as does the actual boot
sector virus).  The trojan/virus copies the boot sector to where the
boot sector virus will find it and copies the virus boot sector to
sector 0.

There has been no report of any program or virus doing this for
Michelangelo.

I am no genius on the subject of viruses, but I feel you may have
dismissed Ms. Marvanova's question too quickly.  We here have also
seen this problem popping up a lot lately (a great deal more than say
a month ago).  We have about 45 AT&T PC clones here (20 386s & 25 88s)
and it seems to have hit the 88s first, then moved to the 386s.  This
makes sense as access to the 386s is more restricted.  Additionally,
should we manage to isolate the thing, who should we send it to?
Thanks in advance.

Subject: DOS total memory check says we're infected but... (PC)

The local paper said CHKDSK without CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT in
place should show 653,312 bytes total memory if the machine has
Michelangelo, and 655,360 if it does not.

We have at least 2 machines at RTI which show 653,312 but are
pronounced Michelangelo-free by the Norton and PCCSCAN programs we
downloaded from CompuServe.

What's the story? Could something else cause the 2K to be missing, or
could Norton or PCCSCAN be somehow missing Michelangelo?

this has happened to me on several occasions. Though it is Possible
that this is a virus, it is Highly unlikely.(also there are no known
(at least by me) viruses that behave in this way). What will ussualy
cause it is software that set up weird things in the keyboard buffer.
Some games will do it and I would assume that some other types of
software would do that. So don't pull your hair out about it.

it is very possible that you have come accross an unknown variant of
the "form" virus. Though I don't knwo much about this particular
virus, it would seem that the variant leaves the same signature in
memory but not on disk.  Suggestion: sned it to McAffee or Vesslin.
and I would also not trust any of those computers either.

This program is suspicious. Now, also if you did not use Scan c: /A

Subject: Bulk Erasers

Using a permanent magnet to erase disks is not really a good idea.
While the magnetic field definitely will destroy the data and
formatting of the disk, it will not really erase the disk.  The medium
is left in a state of magnetization in which all the particles are
either set to 1 or 0, so to speak. Moving it around in a wiping motion
will most likely result in a large portion of the media being
magnetically oriented one way and another large portion oriented
another way.  When the disk spins, the effect on the head is like a
very low frequency alternating current being introduced into the
system.

The reason that an electro magnet is the best choice is that the field
is in a constant state of flux, never staying the same magnetic
orientation or intensity.  As the disk is moved away from it, the
fields become progressively weaker until they have no more effect.
The end result is a magnetic medium with no magnetic orientation or
bias on it, at all.  All the advantages of an electromagnet, however,
are for nothing if you cut the power to it while the disk is within a
few centimeters of the eraser.  This will leave the disk magnetized
just like a permanent magnet would have done.  If you do accidentally
turn off the eraser while using it on a disk, just re-erase that disk
again properly to demagnetize it.

This is how software duplcation was done at the small company I worked
for this past summer. It is not an official policy or statement from
that company.

a) We produced our own disks in house. Usually this was done by
anywhere from one to three people in a duplication room.

b) The equipment used was made by a company called, I believe, Trace
or Tracer. It consisted of a dedicated UNIX box and a bunch of
duplication units. When the programmers finished the program and were
ready to duplicate it, they brought down a master disk for us to copy
onto the UNIX box. One image for 720K disks and one for 360k disks.
The machine was then programmed as to how many copies we wanted to
make of each disk, and what tracing units each program was being
duplicated on. If we had 10 duplication units hooked up to the system,
we could use all of them to make one program, duplicate a different
program on each unit, or any combination there-of. The disks were
loaded into hoppers by hand after being labeled and counted. Then run
was then started and all we had to do was wait for it to finish and
occasionally replentish the hoppers. The majority of the disks are
write protected straight from the disk maker itself. The copiers are
able to copy the disk w/o worrying about the notches or tab positions

The disks themselves were duplicated and then verified by the
unit it was copied on. If it failed, it got chucked into a
separate holind are from the good ones. The bad disks were sent
back to the manufacturer for replacement. As a side note, the
particular machines we ran took 15 seconds to duplicate and
verify a 360K disk and 30 seconds to do the same on a 720K disk.

c) As far as quality checks perfromed, there was the verification
of the disk by the duplication unit itself. The company also made
it's own anti-viral software, so I am assuming that the masters
were carefully checked, as were all of the machines that the
programmers worked on, but I do not know this for sure.

The company itself is small. Every one knows everyone so worrying
about virii getting into the software is not an every day
occurance. There are also security badges that are required to be
worn by every one that works there.
