I'm looking for a Public Domain Virus-checker (and remover if
possible).  It must be a TSR-version.

I'm running DOS 5.0, on 386 PC's. I have FTP-access.

Anyone who knows about such a program, and where to get it.

Thanks in advance

McAfee has recently released NetShield, a NLM version of SCAN. It is
very reasonably priced as well, and finds more virus than Intels NLM.
But note that it will not protect against locally infected
bootsectors, since the server would never know that an infection has
occured, so another protection level will have to be installed for
better security.

Subject: re: Info on "Invol" virus (PC)

A few more notes on INVOL, since Tarkan brings it up:

- - It's only sometimes resident.  In particular, when in a device
  driver it functions as a resident EXE infector, but when in
  an EXE file it functions as a non-resident SYS infector.  So
  if you run an infected EXE, it looks around for SYS files to
  infect, but doesn't go resident.  When you boot with an
  infected SYS file in CONFIG.SYS, it goes resident and infects
  EXE files that are executed.

- - The sample that I have triggers on the 19th of the month (13h).
  I guess there are date-variants?

- - The silly message doesn't always appear twice in infected SYS
  files; there's some "filler" space that gets filled with random
  junk, sometimes from the virus itself (sometimes not).

- - There are actually about 24 bytes that always occur in the
  degarbler, and always in the same order; there are just
  single NOPs between them at times.  If you support
  variable-length don't-cares in your scanner, it's
  not hard to do a signature for even the EXE form.

- - The virus will try any device driver at all that's mentioned
  in CONFIG.SYS, I think (I captured it in TD.SYS).  I'm not
  entirely certain what the "vansi" strings are doing in the virus;
  it looks as though the code is supposed to create a vansi.sys
  device driver to infect if no other sys was found to infect,
  but I've never actually gotten the virus to behave that way!
  (If a mysterious new vansi.sys device driver, or one by any
  other name for that matter, suddenly appears in your CONFIG.SYS,
  it's probably worth investigating...)

- - In general, I wouldn't expect this virus to be a real winner;
  it activates much too often, and much too severely, to survive
  (people will know they have it, and be unwilling to just live
  with it).

fprot 2.05 thinks a  couple of menu.com files are infected with CREW.
However, that happens only w/Quickscan, not  w/ Secure or Heuristics and
2.04 finds no problem. Unfortunately, Virstop also detects CREW and halts.

I've notified Frisk, but unfortunately he's off on vacation.

With Frisk being on holidays, I think I might answer the question as
well:

It's not a bug, it's a feature!!  :-)

But seriously: As stated somewhere in F-Prot's documentation, F-Prot
needs to (re)load parts of it now and then. (I think every text
appearing on screen is stored in one of two datafiles - one for the
user interface and the other one for virus descriptions).

Frisk is well aware of the kind of problems you've got, but - if I remember
correctly - does not plan to change it anytime soon.

I hope I put it right and Frisk won't kill me when reading this!

This is true of some of the latest PS/2 systems as well; you can set
it up to try the disks in just about any order.  If you really want to
try A: first (in case C: contains a CONFIG.SYS that hangs the machine,
for instance), there's a baroque key-sequence that you can do during
boot to make that happen (or to get into the menu that lets you change
the order; I forget which).

I don't know any more details of it, I'm afraid, or even which models
have it.  But it's certainly catching on; good thing!

Subject: F-Prot 2.05 on NetWare.... (PC)

Greetings, all....

  I've run into a *very* strange interaction problem. When using
F-Prot 2.05 to scan a group of servers, it works it's way through five
servers running NetWare 3.11 without any problem. When it gets to the
last server, which is the one it's being run from and which has
NetWare 2.15c installed, it scans merrily along until it hits the
\public\ms_dos\v500 directory, then locks up *solidly*. I can't even
toggle the numlock LED, or do a warm boot. It's red switch time.

  However, it'll scan a DOS 5 system without any problems at all. I
tried changing the command line to remove the /all file selection
switch, with the result that it locks up on a *different* file.
Actions are identical if run interactively (I've got a user set up on
each server to attach the other five and kick off F-Prot automatically
upon login; I run this each morning), scanning all files or
executables. It's consistent about which files it crashes on; scanning
all files it doesn't like DOSSHELL.HLP, and locks *every* time. If
checking executables only, it dies on another file.

  Has anyone else seen this? I've been running 2.04a for weeks without
a glitch, and have dropped back to it until I can figure out what's
going on. It still runs fine.

  My copy of FP-205 was retrieved from uunet, FWIW.

Puzzled;

This is the most common method used by programmers to fight viruses.
I have lost count of the number of articles here and in magazines that try
something similar.

Yes.

No.  For two reasons:
1.  Any virus attached to your program can operate before your program does
    the checksum.  So your program can only say "program changed", after the
    virus has done what it wishes.
2.  The increasing number of "stealth" viruses are able to hide by making
    their changes invisible.  So when an infected program is run the virus
    becomes a TSR and stops you, or your program, seeing the changes made by
    the virus.

A number of programs, including most anti-virus programs, include checks
similar to yours.  The problems, especially with "stealth" viruses, mean
that this feature is often not mentioned, and is not relied upon.

F-PROT means exactly what it says, it has found "bugsres 3 joke
program".  This is not a virus, although Frisk should give information
about the message in his documentation.

There are a series of joke programs known as "Bugsres", when run they
don't appear to do anything, but sometime later they generate a video
effect of a number of little bugs messing about on the screen.  Most
commonly such programs are run, 'for fun', on a computer without the
owner's permission.  F-PROT, and other anti-virus software, therefore
recognise these programs due to the concern that a virus might be
causing these effects.

Hope this helps,

I am not familiar with SuperStor, but i would indeed expect it to
modify Int 13h.  So you should make sure that SuperStor does this
before F-Prot is loaded.  I would expect SuperStor to be a device
driver, in which case you would just move the line, in CONFIG.SYS,
"device=f-driver.sys" below the line loading the SuperStor software.

There are several viruses that do this, and some virus protection
software may even do this to all your files so that such viruses think
that they are already infected.

> If there is then how do I remove it? what does it do etc.

Try running F-PROT, this should recognise most viruses that do this.

I hope this is of assistance,

 Fisrt thing you have to do get a new scan/clean version. Version 89
is out of date. The latest software for antivirus are available in
ftp sites like urvax.urich.edu
  Second, you must boot your sistem from a clean/write protect floppie
to avoid the virus if it in TSR. After you boot you can scan your
computer and clean it.

Yes.   The  file  BUGSRES.COM is not *infected* with the "bugsres 3 joke
program" - BUGSRES.COM *is* the joke program F-Prot has spotted.

It's  a  terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program that can be installed
so that it is "triggered" on a certain keystroke (eg, the 50th time  the
user  hits  the  "A"  key).   When this event occurs, several simplistic
"ants" race around the screen "eating" the characters on the display.  A
certain  key  combination restores the original screen.  (Can't remember
all the details - something like both shift keys together, I think - try
running  it  with  "/Help"  or  other such switches and you should get a
brief summary)

F-Prot  presumably reports this beacause it could cause panic if someone
installs it on someone else's PC as a "joke", as the  victim  may  think
they  have  been  hit  by  a virus.  Paradoxically, you have been caused
concern *because* of the warning             :-)

All self-respecting anti-virus programs do exactly this (or some
equivalent check).  The reason that most advise you to reboot anyway
if there's a virus active is just caution; trying to clean up with an
unkilled virus active in memory can be messy and, while it will often
work, they don't want you to take the chance.

Remember that (unless you do something other than just normal DOS
calls to read yourself), this doesn't work against stealthed viruses,
because you'll see a clean image of yourself.  If your program is big
(so many are these days!) it can slow down loading considerably on
slow machines.  If that's a concern, you don't really have to checksum
every byte of yourself (at least if viruses are your main worry).  But
you do have to check the important ones!  *8)

Virtually any reasonably good check-code will do; unless your programs
become *extremely* popular, no virus author will target them
specifically.

There are quite a few viruses that do this; how to remove it
and what it does depends on which one you have.  Get ahold of
a good scanner and see what it says...

PC viruses cannot infect a non-IBM-architecture machine unless it is
running a PC simulator/emulator.  That program, in addition, sounds
like a joke program I've heard of.  Are you SURE your disk is damaged?

No they don't.  This would make the processor much more complicated, as it
would have to monitor and understand all DMA accesses (including DRAM refresh
cycles, disk data transfers, ..).  And you are asking it throw away
instructions that are already partly executed, and restart them from
their original start conditions.

Cache memory, on the other hand, uses techniques such as "bus snooping" to
ensure that the cache contents are not used if they vary from the real
memory.  It should be noted that the more recent CPUs of most families use
pipelining, (starting to execute several instructions before earlier ones are
complete), to help give their increase in speed.

For most purposes, self modifying programs went out of fashion with the
Commodore PET, around 1979.  (The PET did indeed use a considerable quantity
of self modifying code, too get the maximum speed of operation).

The only use I have made of self-modifying code was for a magazine article in
1989, to identify through software the different members of the 80x86 family.
This indeed relied in the effect of the CPU pre-fetch in one of its tests.

Subject: Re: Fingerprinting files

Suresh,

Your observation that fingerprinting files is the most proven me best
way of virus detection is for the most part true.  Some tricks have to
be pulled to ensure that you bypass stealth viruses, but other than
that, it is the best way.  You raise a very good question regarding
self-modifying exe files (e.g. setver.exe that comes with DOS 5.0).
There are several ways to handle these.  First, one can put them on an
exception list and ignore them.  This is not a good idea for programs
which are executed every time the PC is turned on (again setver.exe
comes to mind), but may be appropriate for files which change due to
their being programs under development (such as would be seen in some
directories of a programmers machine).  The second way to deal with
this is to note the modifi- cation and query the user as to whether
this should be allowed.  This works well for power users, but is prone
to error for the general user who may not un understand what is going
on on his PC, and could, therefore, make the wrong decision.  The
third way is to note where the change occurred, and what type of
change occurred.  Whereas it may be okay for a program to make a
change to its data area, it is probably not okay to see a change in
the program entry point.  Fourth and finally, you can raise the flag
to industry to stop this technique of self-modifyable executables.  It
is irresponsible to have self- modifying executables in today's
computer environment.  Just when we think we are getting a handle on
the virus problem, along comes a suit of programs which modify
themselves.  Not the best idea in my book, regardless of the fact that
it provides a neat solution to some other problems such as making sure
that data-files are located in the right directory, and the need to
execute files from the same directory where their data files are
contained to run properly.  Hope this answers the question.

                        (c) Brain - part 4

Technically, the Brain family, although old, has a number of
interesting points.

Brain itself is the first known MS-DOS virus, aside from those
written by Fred Cohen for his thesis.  In opposition to his, Brain
is a boot sector infector.  One wonders, given the fact that the two
earliest viral programs (for the Apple II family) were "system"
viri, whether there was not some influence from these earlier, and
similar, programs.

Brain is the first example of "stealth" technology.  Not, perhaps,
as fully armoured as other, later, programs, but impressive
nonetheless.  The intercepting and redirection of the system
interrupts had to be limited in order for the virus to determine,
itself, whether or not a target was infected.

The Den Zuk and Ohio variants use the trapping technology which can
be used to have a virus survive a warm boot.  Although they do not
survive, the fact that the <Ctrl><Alt><Del> key sequence is trapped,
and that another piece of programming (in this case, the onscreen
display) is substituted for the reboot code proves the point.  The
virus could be made to survive and to "fake" a reboot.  (The
recovery of the system would likely require a lot of programming and
code.  This has been pointed out before, and the "recovery mode" of
Windows 3.1 probably proves it.)

Den Zuk and Ohio are also "virus hunting viri".  This possibility
has long been discussed, and these examples prove it can be done.
They also indicate that it is not a good idea: Den Zuk and Ohio are
far more dangerous than Brain ever was.

The Solomon and Skulason analyses are fascinating for tracking the
trail of a virus "mutation" through the same, and different,
authors.  The evolution of programming sophistication, the
hesitation to alter the length of text strings, even while they are
being replaced, and the retention and addition of bugs form an
engrossing pattern to follow.
