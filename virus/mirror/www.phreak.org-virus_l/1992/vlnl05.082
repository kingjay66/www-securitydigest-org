That is just part of the problem. I hope that nobody is going to be so
deliberately distructive; anyway the identity of my users is verified
with a fairly strict procedure, and I hope this will discourage such
attempts.

Yes, I have kept the file, and I can send it to you if you wish. Please
send me e-mail stating if you want it sent to your mailing address or
give me a different procedure.

It was not a false positive caused by CPAV, because I made two separate
checks, one with VIRex and the other with VB's scan string. Both were
positive. And no, I have not tried to disinfect the file because I did
not have CPAV myself yet.

Has anyone heard of a virus called 'Elated'.  The victim claims to
have been infected by this virus and said that VSHIELD reported it.
This virus is not listed in any information I have and I have no idea
of removal procedures.  Thanks for any info you have.

Let's hope that they won't appear. If SCAN is really able to detect
any MtE 0.90-beta based virus, then the virus writers won't be tempted
to create such viruses...

BTW, Fear is just a trivial text patch of the Dedicated virus.

Sigh.... :-((( Yet another self-modifying program... I really didn't
expect that from an anti-virus producer... You are trying to create
more difficulties for your competitors who produce integrity checkers
or what? Self-modifying programs are a VERY BAD IDEA! Couldn't you

So this makes -two- new self-modifying programs... I strongly

enough pressure to the program developpers, they'll stop to use this
bad practice.

Does this mean that VALIDATE is now specific to your products only and

Subject: MDISK & FDISK - Are they the same? (PC)

I just picked up CLEAN89B from Simtel20 and when looking through the
documentation noticed that to fix some viruses MDISK is required. I
picked up M-DISK.ZIP from Simtel20, however it only appears to work
with versions of DOS up to 4.01. I have DOS 5.0.

Is there a more recent version of M-DISK available somewhere? I also
noticed on this group that there is discussion of FDISK, already
bundled with DOS 5.0.  Does FDISK perform the same function as MDISK?

Thanks!

Hello

A friend of mine asked me to ask this : How to remove the NEW OMICROM
virus reported by CPAv ?

He used CPAV to remove it and he couldn't remove that properly.
Another thing is that someone told him that the OMICROM virus is a
mutating virus wich can be traced as FRODO or 4096.

Can some one help me so I could help my friend ?

Subject: Vshield vs Word (PC)

We are running VSHIELD (4.8 B86) on 386's in an area of shared
computers (free access to all staff).  It is run as VSHIELD
/chkhi/m/lh.  We are getting conflicts with WORD 5.0 (Microsoft), WORD
will run for several minutes and then the computer will hang, gives
message "cannot access COMAND.COM" or something similar.  Usually
happens when you are using a WORD command, not when you are just
typing.

We are now running WORD from a batch file which removes VSHIELD, uses
WORD and when you quit WORD reinstalls VSHIELD.

Any other suggestions?

I tend to agree that there cannot be a virus for which there is no
protection, but it looks like we are starting to see viruses for which
the vast majority of conventional methods fail.

I can understand scanners failing on mutating viruses - that's "old
hat" , but the claim it can wiggle past "any other memory resident
checker" has me worrying; does that mean only memory-resident scanners
or *any* memory resident checker?

I suspect that these viruses, even if their code differs greatly, will
still always use just one or two methods of infecting - it should be
stoppable at that stage, with a checker that looks at what it does,
rather than the code it uses to do that.

Rememberring that there are more ways of stopping a virus than simply
scanning for it, what other anti-viral methods (e.g. change detectors,
software write-protection, anything) actually succeed? Has anyone
carried out the tests?  If not, could someone with the engine do so -
quick, please!

May I add that in these times, where versions of DOS seems to be
shared between 3.3, 4.1, and 5.0, that you must make sure that you are
using the same DOS version on your floppy as on your Hard Disk. I have
seen several cases where the SYS C: command has loaded a DOS 3.3 or
4.01 to a 5.0 Hard disk. In this case, the disk crashes with an error
of some type. Worse still, if you use Norton Disk Doctor's program,
you may end-up with invalid media descriptors, etc. etc. Thus, take
care to use the same DOS version, or you'll have to re-format the
drive from start.

If the virus is not properly removed, YOU can damage all your files.

Come on now!  If we're comparing two products like this, it makes
sense to compare the modes of operation that are most alike.  If in full
check mode, Integrity Master reads and checks each and every byte on
each and every file (or just executables).  This would seem the most
"apples to apples" basis for comparison, since UT does basically the same
thing.  Will UT check ALL files (not just executables) like IM?   Will
UT check source files (intended for programmers) along with executables?

 >  My claim that UT's quick check is for all practical purposes just as

You don't seriously still maintain that UT's quick check is as secure as
a full check?????   Consider if a single file is infected or corrupted,
UT's quick check will miss this, while Integrity Master's full check
will certainly detect it.

I agree this is a very nice feature of UT.

I believe the fifth generation folks say this ;-)!  Their ads claim
that once you buy UT you will not need to update or buy another product
and be safe forever.  Or do I misunderstand?

  This posting shows that the heuristic analysis is already flawed,
and most people haven't even implemented it yet.  If you can write a
program that will overwrite the MBR and F-Prot 2.02d heuristic scanner
doesn't trip on it, then a virus could use the same code that you are
using.

Subject: Printer, printer, sing a song...

[Moderator's note: Having received this on April Fool's Day, I was
rather skeptical of the message's authenticity.  (I did, by the way,
receive a few other "strange" postings which turned out to be AFD
jokes.)  However, Vesselin assures me that this report is bona fide,
so here it is.]

Regardless of the date of this message, it is not an April Fool's
joke; it's a true story.

A few weeks ago somebody called the Laboratory of Computer Virology in
Sofia and asked for help, "because his printer was infected by a
virus". When asked why does he think so, he replied that his printer
is playing a melody. No, not just a beep, a whole melody.

Since after CNN reported that NSA has shut down the Iraqui air defense
with a printer people tend to believe just -everything- about viruses,
the reaction of the virus experts there was "c'mon, don't be silly".
Of course, they expressed it in a more polite way, like "oh, it's
probably a hardware problem; you should check the manual". Then they
forgot the whole thing.

A few days later somebody else called and reported that his all
three printers are playing one and the same tune. No, not the beep
that they usually emit when they are out of paper. Yes, he has read
the manual and the melody is not mentioned there. Yes, the printers
began to play the melody on one and the same day, although at
different times. One after another, just as if something is infecting
them.

Indeed, it sounded like a virus. One of my colleagues from the Lab
visited the "infected" site. After a while she called back and said
that indeed, all the printers are playing a melody. She put the phone
hook near one of them so that the people at the Lab could hear the
melody. It wasn't "Yankee Doodle". It wasn't a melody played by any of
the known viruses, but it was a melody.

The printers were all of the same kind - "TURCO" or something like
that. They played the melody even when physically detached from the
computer. Now, how do you boot a printer from a clean diskette? :-)

The printers have been bought about a month ago from a company which
didn't exist any more and which imported them from some of the far
east countries.

It took my people almost a week to find somebody who understands those
printers. To make the long story short, it turned out that the
producer has included, for some weird reasons, the possibility to play
this melody when something goes totally wrong - like the printing head
is damaged. This "feature" wasn't documented, since it was thought
that this is a kind of "impossible error", an error that will never
occur. Unfortunately, the printers turned out to be of rather low
quality, so the got out of order pretty soon. And almost at one and
the same time...

So, beware of singing printers... :-)

Regards,
Vesselin

Subject: International virus symbol.

Thanks for everyone's mail on the subject... I think an international
symbol for a computer virus would be useful. it has been pointed out
to me that there is a symbol for a Biological hazard but... Due to
regulations (institutional and otherwise) this cannot be used unless
the disk IS a biological hazard. So should there be a consensus on a
symbol ? I have got a rough draft of one I sometimes used for infected
machines. This is the biological hazard symbol imposed on a disk. If
any one wants a copy in Postscript format just mail me.

Thanks...

Subject: Research help...Please :)

      Hi all !! A brief request.....(hopefully some of you guys and
gals can help me :) I'm doing a couple (actually 3) papers of viruses.
They range from Viruses on PC's to viruses with telecommunications and
networks to Viruses and Information systems (sounds fun doesn't it)
What I could really use are:
      - Some info on good anti virus programs, which is best; I've read tons
        of reviews but still can figure out which is best.
      - Any figures on the infection rates so far for 92 or from 1991 (would
        make a wonderful graph)
      - Some background more info on Michalangelo (I've gotten alot from here
        but would love more)

Anything else anyone wants to send would be very much appriciated. I
get to give presentations for 2 of these (PC's and Telecomm) and I'll
(hopefully) be giving a presentation to my users group in Stow Ohio on
PC Viruses (basicly it will be my presentation for my PC (Small
Systems Tech) class). Thanks to everyone :) I hope to hear from some
of you soon :) I can be mail here at my acct ( CEMERY at
KENTVM.KENT.EDU ) or in the digest, though I dont get to read the
digest every day :( But I'll try to check.  Well, enough babbling.
Test time!! (Need to pass these else wont graduate in Dec). Thanks
again :)

I don't know if there was another one published, but you might check
in the conference proceedings of the Fifth International Computer
Virus and Security Conference, pg 147-155.  The name on the article
was Norton Swimmer, U. of Hamburg.  "1992 Computer Virus Calendar."
It listed viruses by their trigger dates from April to December.
(Neat graphics on the side, a surgeon, a brain writing brain on a
parchment, a chewed up floppy, etc.)  However, it did not seem to be
very complete.  (It's also partly in German.)

Subject: BEACH is still alive!!

Hello Everyone!

	Since the announcement of eugene.gal.utexas.edu as an anti-viral
site, I have received a flood of mail asking about the status of
beach.gal.utexas.edu. Beach is still up and fully operational until I
announce otherwise. I am maintaining 2 sites instead of 1. I will be
upgrading the archives on beach as soon as files come in. The only
difference is that eugene will additionally carry other documentation
and software acquired from CERT (thanks Ken!). So don't worry, beach
will be there when you try to connect!
