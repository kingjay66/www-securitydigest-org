Are you sure?  I expanded Norton's (Ver 6.01) programs and FPROT (2.03
pre-release) skipped them during a SECURE scan, all except NORTON.EXE
and NHELP.EXE  (the integrator, and the help-engine).  These were not
expanded by the installation routine.  However, I didn't try the
Heuristics option.  Shall try that tonight.  One small detail though,
this happened on a stacker volume (I don't think that should matter).

By the way, Norton Anti-Virus (Version 1.5, August release) has the
same problem.

1. Viruses transferred as part of the formating process are very much
possible. Although they would not be inserted during the BIOS
formatting of the diskette, the DOS format command does a lot more
than that, including writing to the disk(ette) a boot sector and
reading what it wrote.  Any sensible virus already in memory would be
able to infect at the time the boot sector was written & verified
(boot sector infectors) and when/if the invisible files and
command.com was written (okay, only *some* file infectors bother with
these). So reformatting your disk (of doubtful value, in my opinion at
the best of times) is useless if your computer is already infected
while you do the format!

2. Slightly off the subject, but interesting anyway, it IS POSSIBLE
for viruses to survive the format process.  If they were already on a
360Kb diskette's boot sector that is formatted on a 1.2Mb drive to
360Kb again there is a slight chance of the original tracks being
readable on other 360Kb drives, and if the MBR of a hard disk is
infected the normal DOS formatting of partitions probably won't affect
it. We're talking about quite a few more cases than walking through
walls occurrances, here.

It is hardly worth it, most viruses by-pass the attribute protection
one way or another, and you don't get a nice warning anyway. It is a
bit more worthwhile using the DR-DOS password protection system, but
there is no substitute for good virus-proof measures - especially
hardware protection with some sort of loud bell.

Yes. All boot sector infectors, (that accounts for a huge number of
infections) plus a few odd file infectors.

I presume you mean DOS 3.31 or above. That's why it is such a neat
idea to keep a bootable diskette handy, made by the system when it is
known to be free of viruses. Actually, this is *the* reason for using
setting the read-only attribute on the system files - to avoid
accidental deletions.

Subject: Polymorphic listing, Stealth in memory (PC)

Hmm.  I do not fully agree with your "Polymorphic Virus List".  I
believde that a truly polymorphic virus would actually mutate some of
it's code -> therefore making it so it would require more than a
"decryptor", as a decryptor could change.  I believe a large portion
of the viruses you listed were in fact Encryptive viruses, with no
metamorphosis features at all.

From my understanding, the current "mutating/polymorphic" viruses are
all encryptive, BUT they actually change their encryption algortyhms.
Therefore, if one discovers one of the encryption algorythms, it will
not be useable to identify all strains, whereas with a virus such as
V2P1/1260, V2P2, V2P6, and V2P6Z, for example, the encryption
algorythm does not change at all, though the key does.  Therefore, one
could find the encryption algorythm (and decryption, for that matter)
and actually decrypt the virus itself into the real virus.  With a
polymorphic virus, this is not so.

Perhaps my terminology is a bit messed up, Lets get it cleared up...
  Polymorphic = Metamorphic = Mutation
  Encryptive does NOT equal any of the above.

Yes?
And, of course, as stated, a virus could be polymorphic and encryptive (I
believe all the polymorphic viruses out there are of this type, indeed)

Yes, true, but I beileve the Fish Virus re-encrypts itself in memory,
which coudl make a simple string scanner a bit messed up if they
didnt' have a good string, yes?

As Ian's posting said, people who buy into the U.S. Anti-virus Service
Offering get access to all the internal stuff.  We don't sell the
software by itself (so it's not exactly "generally available"), but
people who buy the offering get to use it (along with the education,
documentation, support, and so on).

Ian posted a basically-official announcement of the Offering, so you
can pretty much assume that it's accurate, and not just one person
talking...

Indeed, the purpose of this virus technology is beat scanning systems.

However, there are already scanners that will detect Pogue, as well as
the Mutation Engine. McAfee's scan claims 100 accuracy, Alan Soloman
(at my last discussion with him) was at 99% on the MTE, Fridrik I know
is working on it and undoubtedly will be detecting it very soon, and
our product, Novi 1.1 is currently at about 99.7% on the MTE (current
misses being failures of the Engine to work properly, detection for
which I have yet to add).

Moreover, all four of these scanners work well on all of the current
polymorphic viruses. And a few others may also. Generally though,
scanners that lack algorithmic detection schemes and anti-stealth
capabilities are doomed to fare poorer and poorer.

>   It looks like virus scanners would be removed from

This also true to an extent. Dependence on scanners alone should be
removed.

But polymorphics are not the biggest problem scanner developers face.
The biggest problem is glut. The constant influx of new viruses to
scan for.  Straight string scanners will grow larger and slower as new
virus strings are added. When, for example, I plugged the downloaded
update for CPAV 1.1 strings in, the TSR grew by about 4k.

Alternate technologies are needed to compliment scanning. One
discussed much here of late is CRC or Checksum integrity checking.
This system is reliable, but only as far as the user impliments it
and, at best only reports infections "after the fact". Relying on
users to run software doesn't have the defensive level of a TSR
though. i.e. Users scan on a human timescale (based on human decision
and action (and convienence)), viruses and TSRs work with binary
certainity on a computer's timescale.

One aspect of a some products (including ours) is incorporating
unknown detection in the TSR. e.g. When I first received Pogue I ran
it against the unknown-virus systems in our TSR. We detected it going
memory resident but didn't interfere since it wasn't a known virus.
However, when I ran another program and Pogue infected it, the TSR
announced the infection, restored the victem program, and blew the
virus out of memory. I don't know how other products handle this
particular virus, but I know that a few are claiming unknown detection
in their TSRs (CPAV, Virusafe, PC-Cillin, etc).

I do not however think scanners should be scrapped yet. Even the best
unknown-virus TSR system needs a good scanner for installation time if
nothing else. It's also good to be able to name a virus so you know
what you're dealing with.

Actually, since virus-writers have aimed viruses at specific products,
there is no reason not to use more than one. Provided of course the
two are compatible. At the last CARO meeting in NY we discussed having
a CARO compatibility list where included products would not
false-positive or otherwise interfere with one another. Products not
on the list would not be recommended. In the meantime I have been
doing compatibility testing on my machine for AVPD members and others,
at lease to the extent of scanning each other. I generally have the
latest versions of CPAV, NAV, ViruSafe, McAfee, Virex-PC, Virx, Virus
Buster, Untouchable, AV Toolkit, F-Prot, PCRX, PC-Cillin, and Novi on
one of my test machines for just such testing.

Depending on a string scanner alone can be dangerous, since it detects
and filters out the common stuff, creates a breeding ground ripe for
advanced virus-types, and gives you a nice (false) sense of security
while doing so.

Subject: BLUESTREAK/NSA/ARCNET ?? (PC)

Novell periodically issues files called FYIs full of assorted technical
info culled from their tech support department.  These files are
distributed on CompuServe in the NOVLIB section.  The latest file
(FYI192.ZIP) contained an interesting virus related report.

A client had an ARCNET LAN and users could not log in properly.  NETSCAN
was run and JERU-B was found.  So far, so good.  However, to quote the
bulletin:

"...only problem was it was a strain that they had not seen before.
They had a guy from the NSA from the federal government look at it.  He
ran a program called BLUESTREAK.  This is a virus detection program
developed by the government.  It identified the strain of the Jerusalem
B called the Jerusalem DC virus."

The bulletin goes on to say that the JERU-DC virus "attacked the O/S in
such a way that all node addresses were disabled."  (Each node in an
ARCNet LAN has a node address which is usually set in hardware)  The
user had to reset all of the node addresses to get the LAN working.  The
virus also "attacked the Ethernet side of their LAN" in an unspecified way.

Finally, the bulletin says:

"Apparently a lot of these viruses redirect info in order to attach
garbage on to executable files by hooking two software ints.  BLUESTREAK
looks to see what is hooking these two interrupts and checks to see if
it is hardcoded in the applications software.  If not then it determines
that it's a virus."

The Novell document ID on this gem is "FYI.P.9581" and it was dated
"27NOV90" (why is it appearing in the 0292NET.TXT file (Feb 92) in the
current (1st qtr 92) FYI collection?)

I am checking with Novell to see what I can find out.  In the mean time,
Does BLUESTREAK ring a bell with anyone?

You say you retracted your claim yet you went on to defend it again.
That is why I made my comments.  If, in fact, you no longer make
this claim then let's please drop this issue.

Please!  Based on your personal note to me, I waited for your
second posting before I replied and was disappointed to hear you
justifying your comparison again.   If you say you withdraw your
claim, let's let this issue rest.

Please read my remarks carefully.  Strange is it may seem I think
you and I agree more than we disagree <g>.   I was not
"reverting" at all.   From my perspective, there's only one point
where you and disagree and that seems to be my contention that
to compare two products it's best to compare the functions that
are most similar (in the case of Integrity Master and Untouchable,
it's the full check modes).    How about we agree to disagree on
this point?

I thought you said UT will check 10% of the files on a quick
check.  (Are you saying now it checks for you 10% of the viruses
only!?)  If it checks only 1 of 10 files, the odds are a quick
check will miss it on any particular run.

My complaint was not (and still isn't) directed at you.  Please
understand that when I say something to you, I am not necessarily
disagreeing with you or complaining to you.  I don't expect you
to defend FGS's advertising, but, as I have stated before, I
expect you to realize that their claims can causes disastrous
results for the unsuspecting user.  I know this has nothing to
do with the technical merit of their product, but I believe our
responsibilities need to be broader than simply technical
evaluation.

You mentioned that many viruses preserve time and date stamps and
other reasons why you prefer UT's quick check to IM's "quick
integrity update".   The two can not be compared.   IM's "quick
integrity update" is intended as a quick way to bring integrity
data up to date and to check for normal file changes (if the user
is using IM for change tracking).

I expect you and I will have to agree to disagree on your
comparison;  my view will remain that the only fair comparison is
to compare full check modes of both products. After saying all
this, let me repeat that I think Untouchable is a fine product, I
simply have a tiny bias to Integrity Master ;-).

Subject: Vlad the Inhaler? (Win 3.1 upgrade) (PC)

  I upgraded to Windows 3.1, and had an interesting problem.  My D:
drive got semi-trashed and I saw that a task with the title "Vlad the
Inhaler" was running.  (Saw Vlad while using Alt-Tab to switch
windows, trying to bring it up gave me the problems accessing D: that
I started having.)

  While the D: problem is perhaps a problem with Win 3.1, Stacker, a
SCSI drive with an ST-02 interface, and the new SmartDrive, this Vlad
the Inhaler thing is a bit odd.

  I was thinking that it might be some screensaver that comes with Win
3.1, but I looked at the screen savers, and it's not one of them.

  I don't know what it is, so I ask, anybody know?  At this time I
don't think it's a virus, but until I find out what it is, it's a
possibility.

There is, or, rather, will be, a LANprotect product from Intel.  The
product has not yet been released, as was learned when Intel's
LANspool product got a bit of a bad break with an infected release.

Intel is not developing this, but is "second sourcing" it.

   Maybe we mean something different when we talk about "verification".
We do not scan memory at all!  Stealth in files?  What does that mean?

  Agreed. Its emphasis is on integrity checking as it should be.  Sounds
like you have not had a chance to look at the package. Too busy with
sorting out the cute virus names?

   If a virus is so difficult to convince, it may also be slowing down
its own infection rate. No, it won't catch them all with decoys.

Subject: mystery TSR ... (PC)

I have a program that reports the use of TSR's etc.. and it reports
that there is some sort of program running at segment 0DFD, takes up
4.3 KB's of memory, and uses int's 22 2e and 2f.  This "mysterious"
program is always present, even if I boot up without config.sys +
autoexec.bat

My question is ... Is this normal and if not, what can I do??

Subject: NETSCAN 89B and NET$OBJ.SYS (PC)

I have just loaded and tested McAfee Version 89b on my Novell 3.11
network.  In testing NETSCAN, I found that it reported a file in use
during open operation - NET$OBJ.SYS - and gave only the options
abort and retry.  This was consistent on all servers.  Retry of course
still failed, and abort simply ended the scan.

It is my understanding that NET$OBJ.SYS is open at all times that the
network is running (I may certainly be incorrect on this, I'm no expert).
If this is so, then NETSCAN will be of no use whatsoever on SYS disks.

Is anyone aware of a way around this problem, or can anyone detail how
NET$OBJ.SYS can be closed while the network remains up.

Many thanks, Pat

Well, Michelangelo profited from the lack of quality assurance at
various disk production locations worldwide. It "got lucky". Whatever
else people say, I think it was a good thing to warn people of the
virus. I just wish there hadn't been all that media hype. *sigh*

IBM's Virus Scanning Program runs under both DOS and OS/2.  It's
non-trivial for indivuals to get at the moment; if you have access to
Promenade or IBMLINK, it's there.  Or ask your local IBM Marketing Rep
or Branch Office.  I think S&S's programs also have an OS/2 version
now.

But most anti-virus programs ought to work in the DOS compatability
box of OS/2, I'd think.  Did F-PROT not work there?

	the problem is that your scanner may not be effective
	against an unknown virus (or even against some known ones)
	at the time the diskette arrives.  Later, when the virus-
	alert is sounded, and new tools are available, the intrepid
	sleuth will be able to narrow down the time of infection
	by carefully dating the changes, sometimes by comparing
	against backups (to get a fix on the infection period);

	by having such a log available, one can then narrow down
	things even further...

	it's not the only technique to use, but it seems intuitively
	"promising"...
