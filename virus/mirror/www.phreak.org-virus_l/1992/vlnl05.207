Subject: CPAV leftovers: summary (PC)

Here is what I've found out about the "leftovers" I mentioned.

The "CARMEL Software" string is indeed added to files by the
"Immunize" option of Central Point Anti Virus 1.0 and 1.2 (At least; I
could only find those versions, and the new Windows one that has no
such option).

It is not part of the integrity checking program, however. It seems to
be used to pad the executable file to a multiple of 16 before adding
the self-checker, but only under certain conditions (I was unable to
replicate it except on NU.EXE, and I found another padding string
elsewhere).  It is not deleted by the "Remove Immunization" option,
although the file is restored to its original size. The padding string
and a copy of the first bytes of the original immunized program can be
read in the slack space and will disappear as expected when the
deimmunized file is copied.

The user who originally faced the program had indeed used CPAV, not 
the original CARMEL product.

Thanks to those who supported me with suggestions.

Subject: Another Kind Of Droppers (PC)

Not much time ago, a posting by Stefano Turci (Stefano_Turci@
f108.n391.z9.virnet.bad.se) prompted discussion about the fact that
converting a file from .COM to .EXE caused scanners not to recognize
some virus infections any more.

I don't have much to object to the views expressed by the scanners
themselves (well, actually their authors :-) but I faced the same
problem while dealing with the "leftovers" of my previous posting.

That is, files infected with virus 855 (Nov. 17th) and subsequently
immunized with CPAV 1.2 are not recognized as such by F-Prot 2.06,
Scan 97 or VirX 2.4 (I know they are not entirely up-to-date, but all
three recognize the 'vanilla' infection on the same files).

I don't think this is more than an "academic" problem unless the
current DOS version of CPAV still offers immunization, and a bit more
if the rumored MSDOS 6.0-bundled one does (the most recent plain DOS
CPAV I have is 1.2, and WinCPAV doesn't). More generally, I'd say that
the integrity check should be a built-in function, otherwise it can
only build false security.  But somebody here must have said that
before and better than me...

just a note..

some people reading the virus-l/comp.virus want to get the a-v files,
but aren' t able to use ftp, etc.  the list rob slade made of bbs that
have the files is really quite good, but i'm not sure if they would
all have the latest files such as integrity master, f-prot, tbscan,
scan.

for people who do not know how to ftp or do file requests, simple
downloading of files is available on 'traditional' type bbs (not the
internet sites), and rob's list is very good for helping find a bbs
near you that has these files.

anyone who wants to file request, or download these files can do so
from my ( private) system :), the number is 219-273-2431. the login,
if you wish to not identify yourself, is demo account.  the password
is system. of course, i dont really want my system tied up all day and
night doing this, so please look near you first, but if you cant find,
consider this an invitation to get them here.

If you want to read the virus-L faq and cant ftp it, you can d/l it
here, or read it online.

Intergrity Master is sent to this system directly from the author as
is VirX.  F-Prot, Scan, TBscan, and the other programs are obtained
from either the author's ftp sites, or a site utilized by the author.
With all of the hacked a- v programs floating around, it is of course
important to verify that the file you get is really -helping- you.

This is true when using VSHIELD with the /CV option. A better option
to use is the /CF one, which compares the checksums from an external
file created by SCAN /AF command and does not alter any executable
file.

But may be loaded to high memory, and then needs less then 1K of

That's why there is the /NOREMOVE option...

Does your monitor display the default gray at all after the failure?
If not, try to fix your video cable. It just may be a loose contact.
Had that before, and all the gray on the screen turned pink, until I

And we have here variants that put the original MBR at 0,0,2 and
0,0,8. This is irrelevant. What is rellevant is that the problem with
Michelangelo occurs exactly because the "standard" Stoned variant put
the original MBR at 0,0,7 - at the same place as Michelangelo, and
because the two viruses do not recognize each other.

I've had some very strong objections against your virus simulator in
the past. I have not seen yet your MtE simulator, but I have the
following questions about it:

1) Does is simulate perfectly the behavior of the MtE? I.e., are the
dummy files generated by it the same as if generated by the MtE? If
not, then it is not good as a simulator, because the simulation is not
perfect enough.

2) If the answer of the above question is "yes", then it means that it
uses the MtE itself to encrypt the dummy files - because using
anything else would mean imperfect simulation. If it uses the MtE, do
you include the MtE itself in the generated dummies?

3) If the answer of the above question is "no", then the simulation is
again not good enough, since the only way a scanner could detect the
unencrypted replicants of an MtE-based virus is to scan for a scan
signature of the unencrypted body of MtE. If the answer of the above
question is "yes", then it is pretty easy to extract the MtE from the
unencrypted dummies... Therefore, you are distributing malicious
software...

Conclusion: regardless how you answer to the above questions, either
the simulator is useless, or you are distributing malicious
software... Hmm, I was able to draw this conclusion even without
having to look at the simulator... Pretty good, isn't it?... :-)

Leaving the ethical problems aside, do you try all kinds of flags
(i.e., the contents of the AX register before calling the MtE)?
Because, if you don't, you'll be able to generate only a small subset
of the code that can be generated with the MtE...

Subject: CHKDSK & PC-DOS 5.00 (IBM) (PC)

My last last word on DOS 5.00 CHKDSK problem with big disks (promise)

It seems that the same problem *may* exist in PC-DOS 5.00 from IBM
however I do not have PC-DOS 5.00 so cannot say for sure. However if
it does exist, here is how to tell.

First PC-DOS VER/R is said to give a slightly different output than 
MS-DOS 5.00 VER/R e.g.

   IBM DOS Version 5.00
   Revision 1  CSD URxxxxx 02/92

(note: this version apparently has the "fix")

According the report, PC-DOS uses CHKDSK.COM instead of CHKDSK.EXE
(though still in .EXE format) and further, it is 16 bytes shorter than
the MS-DOS 5.00 CHKDSK.EXE (16,184 bytes vs 16,200).

Accordingly, the fragment in question appears to be at DEBUG offset
DS:2633h instead of DS:263Eh (offset used in my .BAT file was
different since file was "converted" to permit update).

The same check should be valid (8B 4F 0F 8B F9 indicates the "early"
version while 8B 7F 0F 32 ED is an indicator of the "fixed" CHKDSK)
just at the different offset, but as said, I do not have a copy of
either version of PC-DOS 5.00 so your guess is probably better than
mine.

12/21 I talked to RG Software:

According to them the numbers are debugging codes that only beta
versions of 10.0 should display.  The numbers only showed up when
vi-spy was being run by the AUTOVS program, so this could have been
the problem somehow.

Their recommendation: erase the current version of vi-spy and
reinstall from an original disk know to be a release version.

When SCAN is run in the presence of certain other anti-viral programs,
such as Central Point Anti Virus, it can erroneously report the presence
of viruses because if the other program uses the same piece of code SCAN
does to detect the virus but does not hide that code in memory.

What NAV reports as Bloomington is more commonly known as NoInt and has

Your data corruption is likely the result of the virus overwriting one of
the sectors with its saved copy of the original boot sector.  The original
boot sector looks to have been written over a sector that serves as your
directory sector thus creating a number of strange looking files.  It is
not that you have invisible junk files on your diskettes but rather the
directory table is bad.  (Garbage in certain fields that get translated as
file names, garbage in other fields that translated into where the supposed
file begins...)  You can edit the directory to eradicate the bad filenames
or better yet, copy off the files you know and reformat the diskettes.

Possible, but difficult.  The biggest problem is that VIRSTOP is written in
100% assembly, while the Secure scan is in a C/assembly mix.  If I created
a "Secure Scan" version of Virstop, I don't see how I could get the memory
requirements below 30K.  The 2K size (if using /DISK) is ok for most users,
but 30K is a different story...

There has been aa lot of talk about OS/2 not being able to be infected

I downloaded the new OS/2 wares from Mcafee and had mixed results.
OScan discovered that there was stoned in two partitions on 120 meg

It removed stoned but also removed the second partition loosing the 80

Are you aware OS/2 scanners that do?  I know that IBM's Antivirus/2
has a DOS-based TSR component which scans memory when a DOS session is
started up.  But that's really an anti-viral for DOS, not OS/2.

Nope.  But I myself create directories under OS/2 HPFS with names like 
"MS-DOS 3.3 Files" and "Today's Downloads" in which I keep normal DOS
files.  I'm sure other people do as well :-)

I, for one, use long file/dir names (such as these) extensively on my
home OS/2 system.  A short filename scanner (e.g., a DOS-based product
running in a DOS session) would see only a very small portion of my
primary HPFS partition, which has DOS files strewn all over it.  That
is why I use an OS/2-specific product.  Opinion: long filenames is one
of the things that makes HPFS so nice to work with, especially when
combined with a command interpreter that can do name completion.

Yes, this is exactly how the current products with virus-like
distribution work. The "loader" is the system login script of Novell
NetWare. When the user logs in, the script checks whether his/her
workstation has an up-to-date version of the software, and if not
copies the newest version of the software from a secure directory on
the server to the workstation and requests a reboot.

The question is incorrect. According to Dr. Cohen's definition, "this"
- -is- a virus. And, since you are using it to do something you would
like to be done, it is obviously a benevolent virus. Do you see the
misunderstanding now? It's all matter of definitions...

Yup... Ever tried MS Windows?... :-)

Does it? Why? Because of the word "virus"? But they just don't use
that word when selling you the package! They call it "Installs and
Updates Hundreds of PCs on a Network in One Easy Step" (Symantec),
"Completely Centralized Anti-Virus Strategy" (Central Point Software)
or others some such...
