Hi folks,
I use Peter Norton's programm and I very interesting in his antyviral
program. Somebody said me that there is Shareware version of NAV
(about 1.5 or something like this). Is this true ?
And if it's true, where can I catch this program ?

Subject: Stoned virus questions (PC)

One secretary's PC has been infected with the STONED virus.

What effect does this virus have on the PC?  How is it propagated?
Where does it reside?

We used Macaffee's SCAN and CLEAN programs to neutralize it, but it
still recurs at unpredictable intervals.  (We may have some floppies
that are infected and un-neutralized, so that could be the problem.)

Please reply via email.

Thanks.

Subject: New Virus (Ultimate Weapen)? (PC)

Dear readers,

    I've got a friend with a possible virus on his disks...
SCANV85 doesn't detect this beast.  He has a HISCREEN 386sx
machine. I haven't seen the problem myself, but after discussion
I understood the following:

Symptoms:
- - It appears that the 'virus' is activated after january 1-st, 1992

- - After boot, a message is displayed:

   +-------------------------------------------+
   ! The Ultimate Weapon has arrived,          !
   ! please contact the nearest police station !
   ! to tell about the illegal copying of you  !
   +-------------------------------------------+

  (Yes, I had a 'printscreen' of the message)
  (No, I don't know if he has an illegal copy of a program ;-))

- - System hangs.

- - After boot from floppy in A: he found ALL his files and directory's
  in the root and next directory-level renamed to CRIMINAL.001,
  CRIMINAL.002, CRIMINAL.003 ..... etc.

    After a format of the HD the virus was gone (of course).  My
friend believes he still has the virus on one of his floppy's, but
doesn't know on wich one. He is going to try to reproduce the problem
to find out which floppy is guilty. Listening to his story, it appears
to me that it might be a boot-sector virus...
I couldn't find any hint in Patricia Hoffman's VSUM list...

Has anyone heard/seen this virus before?

Subject: Joshi Virus and IDE Hard Drives (PC)

How are people removing the Joshi virus from IDE hard drives?  Based
on what I have read in Patricia's VSUM program, the only way to reomve
the virus is via a low-level format.  Since we can't do such a format
on an IDE, do we wind up trashing the drive?  Inquiring minds need to
know.  McAfee's scan/clean find it, and claim to clean it, but
don't....

I'm a Macintosh owner and UNIX programmer with little experience
dealing in MS-DOS viruses, but I seem to remember hearing about a
virus which attacked hard drives on Friday the 13th.

I also have a PC which recently lost its hard drive, at approximately
the stroke of midnight on Friday, December 13.  :-) I don't think this
is a coincidence, and would like to find out more about the virus in
question to prevent a recurrence.

The hard disk received a low-level format, but I still don't know the
source of infection and could re-infect the machine at any time.
E-mail pointers would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: Avoid false alarms/ don't run SCAN when VWATCH is active(PC)

I thought I would post this to help someone else avoid the virus
"scare" I had over Christmas.  When I tried to scan (McAfee V85) a
diskette I had just recd in the mail from Australia, Scan told me I
had three viruses
  BRAIN
  LOZINSKY
  INVADER
active in memory and to power down immediately and reboot from
a clean floppy.
To make a long story (Scan kept finding them but Clean and other
antivirals did not) short, I eventually phoned the McAfee number
and spoke to Aryeh Goretsky.  He immediately diagnosed my problem:
 I had (Central Point's) VWATCH running (on my IBM PS/1).
It seems VWATCH's search strings are not encrypted and SCAN finds
things it thinks are viruses.
  When I subsequently tried the same thing on my PC at work
(UNISYS model 300), SCAN only "found" the BRAIN virus, so

I guess different platforms get different false alarms...

A challenge for all ye guru types and Apple virologists.

The following disturbing message has started showing up on my mac
lately:

 _____________________________________________________________________

 ...it then locks up which kills anything you were doing, must reboot.
The ID number may be different but the message is exact.  The thing in
the left corner that looks like an acorn is the typical Apple bomb.
It seems to happen mostly in Microsoft Excel, but has happened in
ZBASIC also.

Equipment: 512KE, YAH that's right 512KE, with a MacRescue board with
2megs, one external diskette drive, System 6.0.4 or 5, Imagewriter,
mouse, and a confused/angry user.

By the way, I have tried Disinfectant(I think version 1.5) on it and
it finds nothing.

Thanks for you help in advance.

Subject: RE:Theoretical Literature on Viruses

George:

The most likely place to start would be Fred Cohen's doctoral thesis
on the topic.  One caveat, however: the price.
I had wanted to do some research on the topic, and had contacted Dr.
Cohen as a student.  I asked where I might be able to get a copy of
his thesis (or other writings on the topic), and was told that he had
not permitted the issuing institution to keep a copy of it, nor had he
registered it with the media services center in Ann Arbor.  He had
copywrited it and told me that the only way I could take a look at it
(for research as a student, remember) was to buy it from him for some
absurd price.  I've since gotten a copy, and it does contain some
interesting information...if you're at all interested in the theory.
There have been several experts who have argued against some of Cohen's
conclusions, and many of them appear to be correct.  It is, however, a
good introduction to the theory.
Hope this helps...If I ever get around to doing my own research, I'll
pass it along to everyon...for free!

I'd recommend (to everyone) the book "Rogue Programs", edited by Lance
Hoffman*.  It's a collection of papers by various reasonably
legitimate folks (well, including me), and includes a section on
theory that has the two basic Fred Cohen papers, which will address at
least some of what you want.

Yep, Fred Cohen proves that perfect detection (given a program, is it
a virus?) is about equivalent to the halting problem.  Of course, this
doesn't say anything about 99.99% detection, or perfect detection on
any program smaller than 64 megabytes, or...  *8)

Why not?   I would think that some of von N's results might be
directly relevant to computer virus theory?

Subject: New data integrity anti-virus product (PC)

  I've just confirmed that Integrity Master(tm) my new data integrity
and anti-virus product is available on SIMTEL20 (I-M102B.ZIP).
Integrity Master(tm) is an easy to use, data integrity, change
management, security, and anti-virus program.  It is a descendant of
PC Magazine's PCdata integrity toolkit which is still available as
free software.  Unlike my PCdata toolkit, Integrity Master is
shareware ($35 US).  Integrity Master detects known viruses
specifically using scanning techniques and generically by indentifying
specific changes.  Cluster (Dir-2) and companion type viruses are
specifically recognized.

   Integrity Master is a high performance assembly language program,
providing function and performance far beyond any other data integrity
software, yet is easy enough for novice users.

Some distinguishing features:

1) Integrity Master recognizes known viruses by name and will describe
   their characteristics and then guide you through their removal.

2) It can detect not only existing viruses, but will detect as yet unknown
   viruses, by virtue of its ability to detect changes to any file or
   system sector.

3) Integrity Master will detect any form of file or program corruption, not
   just that caused by viruses.  This makes Integrity Master a useful tool
   to provide PC security, change management and hardware error detection.

4) Integrity Master understands which files and areas on your disk are
   special and provides specific diagnosis and recovery if these areas
   have changed.

5) Integrity Master can reload system sectors, even on disks which are
   so badly damaged that DOS can no longer recognize them.

Integrity Master is also available through any ASP BBS, SDN BBS and
on CompuServe IBMSYS lib 3 file I-M102.EXE.

Subject: Write protection - hardware

DEFMTH4.CVP   920105

                  Write protection - hardware

Generally, in the microcomputer world, write protection is held
to mean write protection implemented by hardware.  Although it
is a truism that "whatever the hardware people can do, the
software people can emulate, and whatever the software people
can do the hardware people can emulate", it is physically
impossible to overcome a "sufficient" hardware protection with
software.  Note, however, that not all hardware protection
devices are as safe as they may seem at first glance.
 
First, the universal write protect "tab" on floppy disks.  It
*is* possible to write to *some* write protected drives. 
Certain systems (MS-DOS is not one) check for write protection
in software rather than hardware.  Thus, even though the write
protect device is hardware, the software checking can be
circumvented by a virus.  (In systems where the write protection
*is* effective, it is still the case that the notification of an
attempt to write to the drive is done through software, and so
the warning that something may be going on may be trapped by the
virus.

However, even on some MS-DOS systems, write protection may not
be reliable.  Some manufacturers use an optical, rather than
mechanical, sensor for the write protect tab or notch.  Using
"translucent" floppy disks, the "silvered" write protect tabs or
even the shiny black ones on 5 1/4" diskettes, may allow
sufficient light to get through to the sensor as to leave the
disk unprotected.  It is interesting to note that, because of
the two different protect tab designs, the hardware write
protection circuits for 5 1/4" diskettes generally "fail safe"
in a write disabled configuration, whereas 3 1/2" diskette
drives "fail" into a writable configuration.

(A pity.  I prefer the ability to protect and enable repeatedly
without building up gobs of tape adhesive around the notch.  And
when I did protect 5 1/4s, I used to use "magic" tape as it was
easier to remove.  These days I'm using "Post-it" notes ...)

As in the past, so again I will deplore the failure of drive
manufacturers to provide write protect switches on "fixed media"
hard drives.  Tape and cartridge media do have tabs or switches. 
Those knowledgeable about hardware and drive cabling can
"retrofit" switches, but recent tests at various sites with
hardware write protect switches have indicated problems with
certain types of drives.  No one procedure has been proposed
that works for all types of drives.
