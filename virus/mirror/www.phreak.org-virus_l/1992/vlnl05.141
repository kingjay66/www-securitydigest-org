Hi,

This is not a virus. If you are runing an old (i.e. not the latest)
version of Corel Draw under Windows 3.1, the program will crash when
you use the 'Blend' function. It worked fine under Windows 3.0.

Hope it helps,

George.

Hello Mr. Reeves,

The "Waldo" message is an error message from Windows version of CorelDraw.
I was under the impression that this error message only appeared in beta
test versions of the software (which would be usually limited to a few
beta test sites) but it may have been present in the production version.
You should be able to contact the manufacturer for a patch.

What you actually need is not a special scanner - any off-line scanner
like SCAN or F-Prot will do the job. What you need is a scheduler for
Windows - a program that starts another program at a prescribed time.
I don't know about such program (I am not using Windows myself), but
it should exist - several such programs exist for DOS. I advise you to
check at Simtel20 or ask in one of the Windows-related newsgroups.

Yes, it is. It is a Stoned variant and infects in a similar way. There
are at least 4 different known variants.

Since it is a master boot sector infector, to remove it from your hard
disk it is enough to boot from a DOS 5.0 system diskette and execute
FDISK /MBR. After that you can boot from your hard disk and examine
all diskettes. The virus can be removed from the infected ones - just
copy the files from them somewhere else, then reformat the diskette
and copy the files back. Make sure that the virus is not memory
resident and active, otherwise it will re-infect the diskettes. Most
popular scanner/removers like F-Prot and CLEAN are able to remove this
virus.

Due to way it infects disks, it may damage some hard disks and
high-capacity diskettes when it infects them. Therefore, the damage is
noticed at once. If it has not damaged your hard disk, it means that
it won't do it in the future. However, diskettes with strange formats
(e.g., backups made by some backup programs) might be irreparably
damaged.

The above is, of course, true in general. However, some scanners ARE
better than others. The fact that a particular scanner (SCAN in this
case) is not able to provide good virus identification, does not mean
that good virus identification is impossible. It just means that this
particular scanner is a rather poor tool for identifying viruses. For
instance, Dr. Solomon's Anti-Virus ToolKit provides MUCH better
identification than McAfee's SCAN (I am not comparing the other
features), regardless that both products exist in one and the same
virus population.

My deep regards to your company and to the product (greetings to Alan
Dawson if you happen to see him), but please refrain from claims that
it can deal with unknown viruses. I have seen the product about two
years ago. It had the same claims associated with it, yet it miserably
failed to deal even with some of the existing viruses. Polymorphism
and advanced stealth were serious obstacles against it then.

I do not doubt that it has been much improved since then, yet I am
pretty sure that it won't be able to deal with all unknown viruses...
The virus authors out there are pretty ingenious, you know... I
strongly doubt that a single company is able to thinks of and prevent
all kinds of attacks, let alone of all possible but still unknown
attacks.

Your guess is correct. SCAN has become significantly worse in virus
identification since version 89. Since Michelangelo is indeed a Stoned
variant, it is not surprising that SCAN detects it as such.

A very good argument why exact virus identification is very important!

Yup. The first few bytes are typical for a Stoned-infected boot
sector. Either a variant of Stoned failed to infect this particular
disk properly, or (less probably) some "clever" program tried to
vaccinate your hard disk. It is, indeed, immune against Stoned
infections now, but unfortunately, it has also become non-bootable.

It is very dangerous to make claims that a single anti-virus program
is able (in its current state) to detect any possible viruses -
including the currently unknown ones... In all cases I have seen,
programs which made such claims could be easily bypassed just by a
combination of the currently existing virus techniques. Some of them
could be bypassed even by some of the existing viruses...

This can be circumvented in different ways:

1) The "bait file" technique is not able to detect boot sector
infectors, non-resident, or companion viruses.

2) If the names of the generated bait files are easily predictable, a
targeted virus can easily avoid to infect them.

3) A virus which infects only sometimes, or only files with particular
properties, may just not want to infect the bait files.

This method (on-the-fly scan string capturing) fails miserably with
polymorphic viruses. As to the damage - if the user is "lucky" enough,
the payload of the virus may trigger and cause significant damage -
which would not happen, had the virus been previously detected by a
scanner.

An integrity checker, that is. This is a very powerful tool for virus
detection, but there are some pitfalls:

1) If an intelligent stealth virus is active in memory during the
integrity check, the integrity checker will be unable to spot the
modifications.

2) There are several possible virus attacks against integrity checking
programs, that a virus could use. Companion viruses and DOS-file
fragmentation are two of them. Most of these attacks can be easily
stopped by the integrity checking software, but the producers of this
software must know about them and take some steps to stop them.
Sincerely, do you know what the DOS-file fragmentation attack consists
in, and does the integrity checking part of your product take care of
it?

3) A specific kind of viruses - the so-called slow viruses, cannot be
stopped by integrity checking programs. I mean, there is no practical
way to do it, not that they are theoretically unstoppable. More
exactly, I do not know about any practical way to stop them.

Viruses, written to specifically attack a particular product, usually
do not spread very far, but they are particularly dangerous against
this product, if they are well implemented. Why do you think that your
product is so secure? What steps does it take to prevent a targeted
attack?

A (rather stupid) targeted attack I can think of would be to inspect
the programs started from CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT, "scan" them for
the "scan string" of your program, and delete them, or even better -
replace them with the virus.

BTW, how does your product react if the database of file checksums
suddenly disappears? There are at least two viruses, which attack
integrity checkers in this way, and they do it rather successfully...

Problem is, this is quite unreliable, if the virus is already active
and smart enough...

I wholeheartly agree with the second paragraph, but think that it is
in contradiction with the first. Scanning for a "captured" on-the-fly
signature is still scanning. OK, this is an "auto-updating" scanner,
but it still fails (even more often than the "normal" scanners) with
the polymorphic and with some stealth viruses.

Please, do not think that with the above criticisms I am trying to
underestimate your product. I agree that it is probably a stronger
line of defense against viruses than any scanner-only based defense.
However, I cannot agree with the claims that it can "detect all
viruses - known or unknown", although I can accept that it is able to
detect whole classes of unknown viruses.

Subject: Netware and viruses - some new results (PC)

At QUT, we have set up an experimental network to test viruses in
networked environments, and the first results have just come in -
unbelievable!

I will be talking about this at length at the Virus Bulletin
conference in a few weeks, but I though Virus-L readers would like to
hear a bit before that.

Test 1: Exhaustive test of netware preotection setting on files and
directories against common viruses.

Result: Only 3 of the 15 bits provide any protection - Execute ONLY?
NO GOOD!!!  Read ONLY? NO GOOD!!!

Result: Novell manuals are completely backwards in their depiction of
the rights granted through inheritance!!!  If you follow the manual,
you get wiped out!

Test 2: Exhaustive testing of Unix based server - still underway Test
3: Same for OS/2 LAN Manager - to be reported at conference Other
tests?  Let me know what you want to know, and I will try to do it
ASAP

Conclusion: It is almost impossible to manage netware for safety
against viruses, but it is probably possible if you are a GOOD ENOUGH
sys admin.  More conclusions to follow as they come available.

What kind of a computer do you have?  Several models have CMOS/BIOS

This is very widely known and seen behaviour, and I see it myself more
often in Word Perfect than in other programs.  (Mind you, I use WP a
*lot*.)

Again, this is a very common problem.  All you have to do is go back

Try the Norton Utilities package from Symantec. The program WipeInfo
from version 6.0 of the package has an option to "wipe the slack space

Subject: Need Advice on Evaluating and Ordering Antivirus Software (PC)

I am not very knowledgeable about computer viruses, but I need some
advice regarding antivirus software from an administrative angle.

I want to install such software in the library's ATs, a number of
which are in a public area for searching CDROM databases. We have had
several incidents of viruses getting into the hard disks via the
diskettes used for downloading the results of searches. (I can't write
protect the hard disk, because then the CDROM search software falls;
it needs to write to the disk.)

I currently have McAfee's VSHIELD (version 89) installed at these
sites, and it works well, as far as I can tell. I know how to use SCAN
and CLEAN when an infection occurs.

I understand that in order to make the installation legal, I'll need a
site license. Since I am just a small cog in a large institution, that
means a formal purchase request, and I may need to justify the
selection.

This brings me to my main question: what evaluation criteria are used
in selecting antivirus software? Are there studies available - a la
Consumer Reports - of the various programs, recommending the best
ones? I am satisfied with the McAfee product, but I have access to
FPROT and could obtain others if need be.

Price, of course, is another concern. How do the various packages
compare in terms of their charges for site licensing? Do they offer
special rates for academic institutions?

Any information or references to previous material - whether in
published form, or available via E-mail or FTP - would be greatly
appreciated. I don't need an extensive technical analysis of any
program, just an overall evaluation of its efficacy and
price-worthiness.

Thank you

It is unchanged - I only change the "new.xxx" file for the major
versions - that is, it will be changed for 2.05.  However, please note
that 2.04c is not an official release, and was not supposed to be
widely distributed.

And yes, I have indeed added over 100 new viruses since 2.04..

Subject: os/2 changes to boot sector (OS/2)

(Note:This post is being crossposted to comp.os.os2.apps and
comp.virus in the hopes that one,or both, of the two groups can be of
service)

I currently run a program called 'Integrity Master' by Wolfgang
Stiller. Among other things, this program checks the boot sector of
each partition against a copy it made of the partition,
to detect any changes. My harddrive is a 210 western digital
pyranna(sp) which is currently set up with three partitions:
	OS/2 Boot Manager Partition-A 1 meg partition
	Dos Partition-A 1 meg partition
	FAT/HPFS-I have one last partition which is 200 or so megs
		 and is then subdivided into two logical partition,
		 the first is fat and the second is hpfs.

For further reference paritions and logical partitions will be
refered to as follows:
	C Drive-The 1 meg dos partition
	D Drive-The first logical drive in the last partition, it is
		of type FAT.
	E Drive-The second logical drive in the last partition, it
		is of type HPFS.

My Problem is as follows:When I run IM (Integrity Master) under os/2
to initialize the boot sector, I don't have any problems. However if
I then change to dos, dos will say that the D drive boot sector
has changed! In addition it will say that there is a self executing
program in my D drive dos boot sector! In addition if I then do NOT
re-initalize my data (i.e. its still comparing my current boot
sector to the picture it has in it's memory) and return to os/2,
IM will still say that there is a problem! Matters are further
complicated by the fact that I just had a cmos failure. The specific
failure was that my harddrive and both my disk drives settings were
set to 'disabled'. This could very well be a battery failure (even
though I'v only had the mother board for 6 months) and I am getting
a batter pack to take care of that eventuality. Finally, thinking
that this was all very strange, I ran scan 93 which reported that
everything was fine. In addition, other than my mysterious cmos
erasures, I have not had any problems running dos, os/2, or any of
my applications.

My Question is as follows:Does os/2 change the boot sector of
drives under it's control? In addition, I understand why my first 1
meg, boot manager, partition would have a self booting program in it
but why should my D drive have one? Os/2 does NOT boot from D drive
and dos boots from C drive! So should there be a self running
program on my D drive? I'm very concerned as this sort of activity
is standard viral activity. And finally, is there any known virus
which targets cmos and clears out sections of it?

Thank you for all help, answers can be posted or mailed to me as I
am an avid reader of both groups and I regularly read my mail.

	Thanks again,
			Yaron (The Jester) Goland

Subject: Virus questionnaire, pls

I am planning to set up a survey to obtain some information on the
extension and characteristics of the virus problem in Italy.

The idea would be to gather figures on facts such as:

- - number of reported events
- - number of affected PCs
- - means of identification of the viral nature of the event
- - reported strain and variant
- - nature, extension and cost of the cure
- - etc.

Putting into practice one of Rob Slade's sound advices on prevention,
I have already assumed that I am going to fail :-) i.e. that I am
going to have a response rate <= 0.1% after the third poll. But I wish
to go on anyway; the question is where can I obtain (by e-mail or ftp,
if possible) information that I can use to set up a good questionnaire
without having to start from scratch and re-invent the wheel.  I know
for sure that this kind of surveys are being regularly performed
somewhere in the world; the ideal thing would be to lay my hands on a
question sheet for one of the latest issues.

My total, eternal gratitude :-) shall go to anyone who shall provide
even the leanest shred of help on the subject.

Subject: Re: Jerusalem virus (CVP)

Y.Radai denies ever objecting to the name "Israeli" virus but
remembers objecting to the name PLO given to the virus by some people.
I remember his message regarding the above. The coincidence of dates
was due to the triggering of the virus on friday 13th.  It was finally
agreed that political issues regarding Israel and the middle east in
particular were to be ignored in this case, because there was no
evidence (and there still isn't any) that the virus was written for
political purposes. In fact, some pointers now show the origin of the
virus to be Italy - not at all the same part of the world. Moral of
the story: a new virus can be isolated in a different country than
where it originated.

PS. I was indeed surprised when Padgett advanced the theory of
anti-semitism, which I had never heard of before.  Maybe the ":-)" had
something to do with it...
