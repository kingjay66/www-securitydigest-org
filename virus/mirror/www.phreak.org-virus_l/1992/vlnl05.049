Subject: Just wondering re Jerusalem-B, Michelangelo? (PC)

Maybe I just have bad luck. But in the past 11 months, I've been
infected with Jerusalem-B virus....11 times!!!!
Since I have VSHIELD installed, I'm not so worried about any viruses
spreading, but quite frankly, I'm bored with Jerusalem-B...Where is
the infamous Michealangelo?
If anyone else has been infected more than 11 times, and you want to
take the time to let me know, please do! I'd love to here about it,
It might make me not feel so unfortunate.       O O
Thanks in advance!                            o

Vesselin, have a quick question for ya. Regarding virii in general but
perhaps the Michelangelo virus in particular (as it seems to be the
most popular right now), one always reads about "booting from a clean
floppy" and my question is this: If one boots from an infected floppy
and then scans the disk (floppy or hard) will the memory-resident
virus disable the scan program rendering it unable to detect the virus
in question? Or will the scanner still pick it up? If it renders the
scanner useless then how does one with only a single computer get a
"clean" copy of a scanner (shareware) to scan a system since all
diskettes must be considered "suspect until they are proven
otherwise". I had an infection with Jerusalem B last year but it
wasn't near as nasty as this Michelangelo one seems to be and was very
easy to detect and remove. I appreciate your help on this probably
silly question but it is something I have been wondering about.
                                        Thanks,
                                        Steve

Subject: McAfee's CLEAN and F-Prot against FORM virus (PC)

We - at Academic Computing Centre of Utrecht University (ACCU), the
Netherlands - tried to remove the FORM virus from several hard disks
using McAfee's CLEAN version 8.3B86. All disks were larger than 60 MB,
formatted with DOS 5.0, some with one large partition, others with
multiple partitions (C:, D:, etc.).

CLEAN always reports removal of the [FORM] virus, but completely
destroys the boot sector of partition C:, making it unreachable at the
next bootstrap. Although FORM puts the original bootsector at the
end of the hard disk, CLEAN doesn't seem to be able to find it.

So does F-PROT 2.02D of Fridrik Skulason, but at least this program
correctly reports that it can't find the original bootsector, instead of
messing up the system.

It seems quite simple to locate the original bootsector at the very end of
the hard disk. Why then do both these programs not succeed?

Of course, the simple remedy against most boot sector viruses is the DOS
SYS command. But CLEAN even makes things worse! May be could someone from
McAfee Associates explain what's wrong?

Subject: Damage Tally Proposal - Michelangelo (PC)

        March 6 is a Friday.  I expect someone will ask me on
  Monday, the 9th: "So, heard of any disks ruined by Michelangelo,
  or was this just another hysteria special-interest groups are so
  fond of whipping up?" (No, our anti-virus campaign was a complete
  success ;-)
       I'd like to have an answer that encompasses more than just
  my little corner of the world so here's what I propose:
       If you have (what you feel are) believable reports of
  Michelangelo-trashed disks in your vicinity, keep a tally of the
  numbers until about Thursday (12th)  or Friday and then send me
  the totals.  Include, if possible, A) Environment of affected
  computers, e.g., industrial, educational, home; B) Some indication
  of reliability of the info, e.g., Solid, Not-sure,-but-I-believe-
  it;  C) City, State/Province/Canton, Country;  D) details of any
  particularly tragic losses.
      Don't let my tone fool you.  I'm serious about this.
  Write following on a scrap of paper and tape to your computer:
  Send tally to: Mickey@UKANVM.CC.UKANS.EDU  or Mickey@UKANVM.bitnet

  I will compile the results, if any, and report here.  As a survey,
  this will be almost worthless, but it may give some idea whether
  this virus earned its rep, and the distribution might be
  interesting.  Do not worry, I will not post names of institutions.

Dear reader,

Perhaps this is a too simple question for the regular users of this
list (I am new here) but I would like to ask it anyway.

I recently bought Novell Netware and network hardware and
now I here that there's a risk that this software is infected.

My question is this: What do I need to scan our computer for
virusses?

Is there a list of hex-sequences to import into anti-virus programs?
Is there some public domain wherefrom I can download anti-virus programs?

Thanks in advance, greetings from Holland,

My tests do not bear out these claims, at least as regards speed.
Here are the times it took for Integrity Master and UnTouchable to
check all executable files on my hard disk (I threw in McAfee's SCAN
also):
  Known-virus scanner component:
                        SCAN 86b         3:49
                        IM 1.02          2:13
                        UTScan 21.00     1:02
  Generic checker:
                        UT full check    2:27
                        IM               1:59
                        UT quick check   1:09

Note 1: As opposed to most "quick checks" and "Turbo modes", UT's
quick check is performed in such a way that for all practical purposes
there is no loss of security, *regardless of how the virus infects*.)

Note 2: UTScan's speed is not decreased by addition of more viruses.


>It apparently detects more known viruses with its scanner component

I don't know how good the IM scanner rates, but according to the Feb.
issue of the Virus Bulletin (p. 23), Ver. 19.04 of the UTScan compo-
nent of UT detected 73% of the viruses in their "standard" set and 81%
in their "acid" test.
  Now these percentages are relatively low (although I think they
would be considerably higher if only commonly occurring viruses were
used in the comparison).  But how important is this factor in the case
of Untouchable?  For a user who depends *only* on a KVS (Known-Virus
Scanner), ability to keep up with all the latest viruses is essential,
and such a low percentage could not be tolerated.  As for IM, it is
generic with respect to detection, hence a KVS is not needed to detect
the fact that infection has occurred.  However, IM can *restore* files
only if they are infected by viruses which it *specifically recogni-
zes* (assuming backups are not available), hence a KVS is just as
necessary for IM as for those who use a KVS alone.  In fact, IM is
even *more* dependent on a KVS, for (like all programs based on modi-
fication detection) IM must ensure that the files and boot records are
uninfected when checksums are initially computed.
  On the other hand, UT performs *generic restoration* of files and
boot records, hence it requires a KVS only for the second purpose, not
for the first.  With UT, a KVS need be performed on a given file only
once, namely before it is added to the checksum database (or is re-
placed by a new version of the file).
  Now suppose the worst happens and some files or boot records are al-
ready infected at installation time by a rare virus which is not re-
cognized by the KVS.  What would be lost then?  In practice, not as
much as people think.  In almost all cases, one can be sure the boot
records are uninfected by using SYS and FDISK/MBR.  Moreover, if some
files happen to be infected by an unknown virus when their checksum is
first computed, that fact will be detected as soon as the virus in-
fects other files.  So the number of viruses recognized is less impor-
tant for Untouchable than for almost any other type of anti-viral
software.  (Nevertheless, because of criticisms of its low scanning
percentage, I am told that the next version of UTScan will detect many
more viruses than the present one; in fact, the version I have (21.00)
is already considerably improved.)

  Summary:  UT performs generic disinfection of files; IM does not.
Untouchable is faster than IM, especially with respect to their known-
virus scanners.  IM's scanner probably detects more viruses than UT's,
though I don't think that's as significant as most people assume it
is.  (Btw, I'm not trying to "knock" IM; it seems to be one of the
best packages of its kind.  But then so was V-Analyst 2.3, the prede-
cessor of UT.)

>and finds other discrepancies which Untouchable misses (I'll go into
>these via private mail if you wish).

I'd be glad to hear what you think UT misses.  I'm willing to bet that
there are a couple of types of potential viruses that IM misses.

An office which I do some computer support for has a batch of
computers infected with Stoned.  These are Northgate 286s.

Someone found stoned on the computers using McAfee.  They ran clean,
and now can only access select files on the computer.  They are going
to reformat the HD and reload everything.

My question is this, I'm probably going to be asked to get stoned off
the remaining computers.  What is the best way to do this?

Any thoughts would be appreciated.

You can instruct F-Prot to scan *all* files, if you want to. Choose

That depends on just what your "RESET" button does; vanilla IBM PC's
and PS/2's don't have such a thing (last time I looked!).  If it
really causes a COLD boot (and I imagine many/most of them do), that
should indeed clear memory just like a power-cycle does (and with less
stress on the components!).  If you're incredibly paranoid (as I tend
to be, I admit), a cold boot is still somewhat nicer, as it forcibly
resets all the adapter cards and stuff on the bus as well; this
doesn't matter for any current virus that I can think of, but
someday...

These are the two products that our in-house PC support group
uses.  I think they install VSHIELD on all new PCs before delivering
them to the users (we must have a site liscense).  But other than
knowing that VSHIELD is on my PC and is invoked out of my
autoexec.bat, I don't know exactly what these products are supposed
to do or what they're supposed to protect against.  VSHIELD appears
to be a TSR, but does it detect currently infected disks, or just
prevent future infections *after* it is installed?  SCAN looks
like it scans every file on my disk, but is the version I have
current enough to pick up the latest viruses?

As you can tell, I'm pretty "virus ignorant".  I've pretty much
ignored the various virus scares since I don't use BBS's or
shareware.  The PC group says run these programs, so I run them
like a good little engineer.  However, my PC now accesses
a PC network in our plant and I heard that Michelangelo has been
found on a few PCs at our work location ...

Subject: Disabling boot from floppy? (PC)

I have often wondered, is it possible to disable the drive
capable of booting from a floppy?

If this is done, much heartache can be spared as most viruses,
that I have seen, rely on a boot to load up to memory.  This would
be used to help those who, much to their dismay, find out, only too
late, that they have booted with a floppy in drive A.  They would
now be at the mercy of a possible virus.

My question is this:
Is is possible to disable a boot from a floppy and then enable upon
demand?  Could it be done by just executing some batch or .EXE file?
This should take care of the Michaelangelo virus!

I have on occasion used a bulk eraser and then (re)formated both 3.5
and 5.25 floppies.  Sometimes I even have noticed that "lost" or bad
data blocks are "found" and useable.

Subject: Virus-L on a CD-ROM?

Hi netlanders!

Just wondering, does there exist a CD-ROM with the Virus-L digests on, and if
not, are there any plans to do so? Virus-L is an ideal source to track the
spread of virii, and it seems a pity to have to keep on requesting the
articles from ftp sites.

Many thanks,

Chris
