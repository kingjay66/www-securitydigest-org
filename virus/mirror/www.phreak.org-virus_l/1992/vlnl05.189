I note a psoting through Newsbytes today, regarding an announcement by 
International Data Security (whose initials, interestingly, turn out to be IDC)
,
ranking the world's antiviral software.

Now, I don't know how badly this got garbled by Newsbytes, but we only have
Dr. Sol's AVT, CPAV, NAV, and McAfee listed.  McAfee gets off with highest
marks at 95%.  The tests were supposed to have been conducted over 15 months
by Virus Bulletin, VSUM library, NCSA (ah, but which one?) and the Hamburg
Virus Test Center (Vesselin?).

(Sorry, McAfee got 97%.  It was the only one that got more than 95% is what 
the report says.)

Although IDC is reporting this as "test results", it looks an awful lot like
they just went and added up everyone elses results.

Hello,
  I am trying to update my Norton Antivirus program.  I want to call
their Symantec BBS to get the most recent virus definitions file,
and the phone number I have is (408) 973-9834 for the 9600 baud

Hi,

I'm new to this newsgroup and I don't read it often. Further yet, I am
not very updated on viruses in the 90's.

At any rate, I just wanted to know what a "brain virus" is and how it
differs from a "normal" virus.

All responses are welcome. Please email direct.

Thanx in advance!

Subject: Windows Virus?? (PC)

   I been having some problems with my MS-Windows and I am wondering if
it is a virus.  

   Lots of my windows icons had changed for no reason.  I have no way
to change my icon back.  I did file-properity-change icon:  the icon
shown selected is the correct icon, but it did not display the correct
icon.  The first icon I notices was for Excel, I have a yellow round face
with red triangle eyes.  It looks very evil.  More then half of 
my icon changed.  

  Does anyone have the same problem?  NAV, SCAN, CPAV did not detect
any present of virus.  Is windows virus different then DOS?  Is there
anti-virus program for windows virus?  

Please help.

Subject: Antiviral SW leftovers (PC)

Hello Virus-L-ers,

 I've read the list for some months and I've found here answers to many 
 of my questions about viruses, but I'm afraid I have some more left...

 I received a phone call today (from a virus-aware PC user) saying:

 " I' ve had some random problems on my PC and wondered if some virus 
 could be responsible for this. The scanners I used (McAfee & F-Prot) 
 couldn't find anything, but they are getting oldish.
 I also poked around with PCTools, and find a strange repeating pattern 
 in the slack space of many .EXE files. It contains something like 
 'Carmel SW' and a copy of the 'MZ' signature, not the usual garbage...
 While I get up-to-date scanners, Do I need to panic? "

 Since I know of no viruses made by Carmel SW, but I've found it in the 
 contacts list as an ANTI-virus producer, I guessed that it was a 
 "leftover" from their Turbo Anti-Virus integrity checker module. 
 The only problem is the user swears he has NEVER used Turbo A-V, but 
 that's his business ... :-)

 Question #1:  Is my guessing about Turbo A-V right ?

 Question #2:  Assumed I can't buy all the Anti-viral SW currently on 
 the market, is it possible (wise?) to have a synopsis of the various 
 "leftovers" that I can find on a HD on which a virus-buster has been 
 before me, like this ? : 

  . *.CPS hidden Files                    -> CPAV was used here
  . 77-bytes *._XE, *._OM Files           -> NAV
  . 10 bytes file growth, fixed trailer   -> McAfee's Scan /AV
  (possibly more detailed ?)

 Question #3: Am I asking the right things in the right place ? :-)

                                             Thanks,
                                              Luca.

I am currently having problems getting rid of the "FORM" virus from our LAN 
sys.  Does anyone know anything about this virus?  Norton Anti-Virus does not 
seem to eliminate it, although F-prot does.  I am using F-prot on all the 
stations, so I thought I had taken care of it.  Unfortunately, some bizarre 
disk errors have occurred recently.

Does anyone know anything about what this virus does?  Are there Norton virus 
definitions available for it?

The RCMP has reported that a new virus has been developed at Algonquin
College and is now spreading throughout town.  It is known as the
"COLLEGE" virus and may not yet be detected by our anti-virus
software.

The officer interviewed had lost his hard disk while investigating the

It was brought to my attention from a friend of mine that there were
some bugs when using the ATSPEED.COM.

	Apparently, instead of speeding up the repeat keystroke of the
PC, the corrupted program (ATSPEED.COM) will delete the Config.sys
file in the PC. The next time the PC is started, normal application
such as windows does not work. By making the Config.sys read only does
not help at all too.

	The following changes has been noted externally:
i) the attribute of ATSPEED.COM has been changed to make is Read-Only
and Hidden.
ii)The size of the file has increase from 214 to 342 bytes and the
date/time created from 06-12-88 5.54 p.m. to 01-01-99 12:59p.

Well, I need your help to solve this.
	Any ideas? If you do, Please e-mail to me directly.

Subject: Scanner Wars (was MtE Wars) (PC)

IMHO what we are seeing is the final breakdown of the scanner as the
first line of defense that was predicted in these (electronic) pages
over two years ago. The simple volume of viruses, encrypted or not, is
getting out of hand.

In the meantime, the integrity managers continue to languish on the 
shelf. There are several which meet my requirements for notification
when needed, keeping quiet when not, some of which I have been using 
for some time: Enigma-Logic's PC Virus-Safe,  Dr. Panda's Physical,
and Leprechaun's Virus Buster. I have not had the opportunity to try
Fred's ASP but have no reason to doubt its effectiveness.

You never see these advertised and rarely are part of popular magazine
shoot-outs yet they are effective in ways that simple scanners are just
beginning to appreciate (McAfee's VSHIELD comes close but is still missing
some key elements).

The big difference ? Each has a TSR that is really a change monitor and
each keeps a record in a single location of changes (an audit trail).
Where most systems are just a snapshot of *now*, these allow you to analyze
what has gone before, often an essential clue in fast identification  and 
recovery.

These are the "something" detectors that are essential in determining
that changes have occurred and each has the capability to check every
file on the disk for changes as well as unknown files. Your scanner says
the MtE is present ? A change detector will identify every file that has 
changed - not identify the infection but will identify the change.

Worried about Commander Bomber ? The file changed. Not to say that there
are not caveats and performance hits, but these can be minimal. As far
as I am concerned, this kind of layered approach is the only effective
answer and if used effectively, the pressure will be off the scanners
to perform with blinding (and careless) speed.

However the market is speaking (from ignorance). Integrity managers are
languishing and the colorful scanners with nice GUI pop-ups are selling
while the people with the answers that do not need updates are having
to let people go and are not being able to create the Windows/OS2/Unix
answers that are going to be needed in a year or two (some do work under
Windows but more because they do not try to be fancy, rather just
report when necessary). Have yet to see something that reconnects
each Window.

NLMs are a case in point. The ones I have seen are nothing more than
glorified scanners that detect infections on the LAN only after it has 
taken place (failed attempts are not noted). From the way they act, it
seems as if someone just took a MS-DOS engine and replaced the DOS
calls with Netware ones, making no use of the dual state nature of
a client-server pair.

The BIOS level is even easier to work in yet now we are down to just
one anti-viral of any kind (and it is not a scanner) other than my own
technology demonstrators - after almost three years the only people
who seem unafraid other than Andy Hopkins are AMI, Phoenix, and Western 
Digital - not vendors that you normally think of in terms of anti-virus.

The simple fact is that it is trivial to write a virus to get around a 
scanner and only slightly more difficult to get around all of the common
ones. At the same time it is very difficult to write an intrusion 
program that can get around a good layered set of integrity management 
routines. 

As far as hardware is concerned, selection of the boot drive (C:) is
sufficient. If you really want to boot from a floppy, 20 bytes in the 
MBR (software) will let you  hold down the Ctrl key while booting to redirect 
the boot to A: instead of C:. A few more bytes and you can restore the 
interrupt table even if you do manage to become infected first. In a single 
state machine a virus cannot protect itself any more than a program can. 
"Turing" works both ways.

When you have a physical control problem or detecting intrusion immediately
is not enough then write protecting the disk is necessary. Roger Thompson
(Leprechaun again) has a nice hardware device that goes in an IDE cable
and lets you use the keyboard lock switch to do the same thing to a partition.
For an RLL, MFM, or SCSI drive, a simple spdt switch, a 10k resistor, and a 
bit of wire is all that is needed (keyboard lock switches are usually spst).

Not necessarily appropriate for a standalone, but to be able to write protect
all elements on a server other than the network directories themselves is
an elegant solution and even an ST-412 drive is big enough for the MS-DOS part
of a multi-gibabyte server.

So you see that you must be able to escalate the response to match the threat,
for a server, a bit more investment and protection is appropriate but for 
normal PCs, boot selection and some simple integrity software is very 
difficult to defeat. IMHO scanners belong on write protected maintenace disks
and stand-alones used for screening of new software, not on workstations.

However "Ten million lemmings can't be wrong."

						Warmly,
							Padgett

From:    bontchev@fbihh.informatik.uni-hamburg.de (Vesselin Bontchev)
Subject: SCAN 99 and MtE detection (PC)

Hello, everybody!

As soon as the new version (99) of McAfee Associates' VIRUSCAN was
officially available, I downloaded it directly from their anonymous
ftp site and repeated the MtE detection tests with it. Here are the
results.

Program: SCAN 99

Actually, the above should read "NETSCAN 99B". We keep our replicants
of MtE-based viruses on a Novell NetWare server (they occupy more than
60 Mb). As you all know, SCAN is not supposed to work with networks;
you must use NETSCAN to scan them. However, I have forgotten that, and
SCAN 97 -did- work with networks perfectly! I was rather surprised
when version 99 refused to scan the networked drive where the viruses
were... :-) Obviously this has been an unwanted "feature", which has
been later removed...

Anyway, I was forced to use NETSCAN during the tests. I suppose that
SCAN has exactly the same MtE detection algorithm, but of course, have
no proof for that. However, each time NETSCAN missed a replicant, I
copied it to the local hard disk and verified that the SCAN 99 misses
it too. Therefore, I can say that SCAN 99 has at most no better MtE
detector than NETSCAN 99B.

In the description below, each time I am saying "SCAN", you should
understand "NETSCAN 99B", having in mind that the missed replicants
were double-checked with SCAN 99.

1) The standard test.

Virus name:	Total samples:	Detected:	Missed:	Reliable?
- -----------	--------------	---------	-------	---------
CoffeeShop	    2000	2000		0	Yes
CryptLab	    2000	2000		0	Yes
Dedicated	    2000	2000		0	Yes
Fear		    2000	1879		121	NO
Groove (EXE)	    2000	2000		0	Yes
Groove (COM)	    2000	2000		0	Yes
Pogue		    2000	2000		0	Yes
Questo		    1994	1852		142	NO

This version of SCAN seemed to be unreliable only with Fear and
Questo. All missed files were unencrypted. A total of 263 samples out
of 4000 were missed. For those who like statistics, this means that
the detection rate is 93.4% or that one infected file is missed in
every 15. In fact, SCAN misses almost -all- unencrypted replicants of
those two viruses (their number was 141 for Fear and 150 for Questo).
It is still beyond my understanding why this happens - it is so simple
to pick a scan string from the MtE body and besides, SCAN -does-
detect the unencrypted replicants of the other viruses... Maybe
somebody from McAfee Associates can explain what the technical problem
is?

2) The additional test.

Virus name:	Total samples:	Detected:	Missed:	Reliable?
- -----------	--------------	---------	-------	---------
CoffeeShop	    3		3		0	Yes
CryptLab	    1		1		0	Yes
Dedicated	    108		108		0	Yes
Fear		    28		25		3	NO
Groove (EXE)	    1		1		0	Yes
Groove (COM)	    21		21		0	Yes
Pogue		    102		102		0	Yes
Questo		    100		94		6	NO

Clearly the same results as above. All viruses except Fear and Questo
are detected reliably. Only unencrypted replicants of Fear and Questo
are missed. The numbers are too small to be useful for any kind of
statistics; they just confirm the main conclusion of the standard
test.

3) The acid test.

The program was tested against 5 replicants of Insufficient - a
companion MtE-based virus. One of the replicants was not detected. Not
surprisingly (after the above results), it was unencrypted.

4) The additional acid test.

Since the tests of version 97 of the product, some new MtE-based
viruses appeared. I decided to test the new version against a few
replicants of each of them. The test results are not of any serious
value, since only very few replicants were used and no other scanner
were submitted to the same tests; so these results cannot be used for
comparison.

The following new viruses were used:

A) Encroacher.A, 7 replicants. SCAN detected all of them.

B) Encroacher.B, 6 replicants. SCAN detected all of them.

C) Groove.B, 11 replicants. SCAN missed one of them. However, the
missed sample is encrypted.

When the tests were already ready and I was writing this message, one
of McAfee Associates' programmers (Igor Grebert) contacted me and told
me that if SCAN doesn't achieve 100% detection in my tests, I should 
try it with the /A option.

According to the documentation, the /A option means "scan all files",
i.e., files with any extension (not only the executables). The reason
for it is that some files with non-executable extensions (e.g. .APP)
might be Exec'ed from an application. If a virus is active in the
memory of the computer at that time, it may infect this file.
Therefore, once an infection is discovered, it is a good idea to run
SCAN with the /A option, just in case, to verify that some of your
files with non-executable extensions are not infected...

However, nowhere in the documentation it is mentioned that the /A
option increases the ability of the scanner to find viruses in files
with executable extensions...

Nevertheless, I re-ran the tests, this time with the /A option.
Surprisingly, this time all infected replicants (except one) were
detected. My guess is that this option also forces SCAN to plainly
scan the whole file, instead of trying to be smart, so the
(plain-text) scan string from the MtE body is found in the unencrypted
samples that are normally missed. I do not think that this is a
correct behavior; there is no reason why those samples should be
missed in "regular" mode... Coming to think about this, maybe with the
/A option SCAN will be able to detect the Commander Bomber virus
reliably? (It is trivial to detect it, if you scan the whole file.)
I'll have to check this...

Anyway, it seems that when run with the /A option, SCAN (the same goes
for NETSCAN) -is- able to detect the -known- MtE-based viruses
reliably. The only one missed sample was Groove.B, which McAfee
Associates probably have not seen yet. (Not that this is a sound
excuse; for instance, F-Prot 2.06a -did- detect it, regardless that 
Frisk had not seen it either...)

I would strongly advise McAfee Associates to fix the small buglet that
forces you to use the /A option, in order to achieve reliable
detection of Fear and Questo. Any number of normally missed replicants
will be made available to them on request. Meanwhile, I would advise
the users of SCAN to upgrade to version 99 and if they encounter an
infection with an MtE-based virus, to re-run SCAN with the /A option.
(It is highly probable that even without this option, at least -some-
replicants of the virus will be detected, so you will be warned about
the infection.)

Subject: Potentially stupid question (OS/2) (PC)

I am not too familiar with OS/2 but am told its going to be very
popular soon :-(.
Our antiviral software (F-PROT) doesn't seem to run well under OS/2.
 (It eventually hangs up when scanning, saying
   "ERROR SCANNING DRIVE D:")

  McAfee SCAN (V99) apparently  gets the same results.

My question:
 What are people running OS/2 using/running as anti-viral software?

Hi Vesselin and the others!

I'm happy to have access to VIRUS-L via VIRNet, this is very nice!

I just wanted to make an offer: If there's any need for a German
document about MS-DOS viruses (kinds of, what they can and can't do,
how to fight them, which kind of antivirus-utilities exist and some
really frequently asked questions), there is something I wrote some
weeks ago. The only thing you need to get it is FIDO-Net access.

The file is available in FIDO at the following adresses:

Possibly the reason that ASP is not reviewed/mentioned is that few
people have it. Further, many a-v products discussed (not all) are
available from one of the FTP sites for downloading and examination
(even versions of Central Point and NAV were made available during the
Michelangelo incident). Demand for a product must be created and there
will be little discussion of a product no-one has.

Further, while there have been some new product announcements, these
have been limited to just that (usually) without hype. Bug reports
(and fixes) are much more common. Virus-L has been remarkably free of
marketing.

For that matter, most announcements have been to address unfilled
needs: If ASP does things that no-one else does, feel free to start a
discussion, you might even get some helpful hints. For example, does
it work with Windows 3.1 ? OS2 ? Unix ? Is there a BIOS element
compatable with Novell servers ? Does it use a diffeent authentication
mechanism on each PC ?

Funny thing, I made a point of mentioning ASP in my last posting even
though personally have never even seen a copy. Am sure that if you
send Rob a copy he will review it.

Most scanners specify "known viruses". What happens when used with an
integrity management program that performs 100% signature validation ?
(used to say "checksum" but have been corrected). Does ASP detect its
own "viruses" ? I am not going to address the morality issue of the
above though I am certain that others will.

Jon (correctly IMHO) also considers COPY a virus. This would seem to
meet your definition as well.

OK

Subject: Index to files on anti-virus sites?

There are a lot of files on the various anti-virus archive sites.
Does anyone maintain an index to these files?  I'm looking for
something similar to the index files on archive.umich.edu in which
there is a file name followed by a brief abstract of what the file
contains.  Such a thing (if it exists) would be real useful for people
looking for a specific type of anti-virus program but not knowing its
file name.

If any anti-virus site does have such a listing could you please send
me email or post the information here.

gratzi!

Subject: MtE detection tests (part 5/5) (PC)

Hello, everybody!

Here is the long awaited report about the MtE detection tests that we
performed at VTC-Hamburg.  It is rather longish, so maybe Ken should
consider splitting it into parts.  Normally, I should have put it for
anonymous ftp, instead of publishing it here, but the preliminary
results of the tests raised enough interest and discussions, so I
decided to publish it in a whole in this newsgroup.  Nevertheless, it
- - -is- available for anonymous ftp as

ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de:pub/virus/texts/tests/mtetests.zip

[Moderator's note: The complete text of Vesselin's MtE tests are also
available from:
      cert.org:pub/virus-l/docs/mtetests.zip 
As I had previously indicated, I have broken Vesselin's tests down
into five parts and will post each seperately.]

Enjoy.  Comments, questions, and suggestions are welcome.

Regards,
Vesselin

[part 5/5]

5. Summary.

Here is a summary of all MtE-based viruses and a list of all scanners
that reliably detected them.

Virus Name: Reliably detected by:
- ----------- ---------------------
CoffeeShop  CATCHMTE, F-PROT, FINDVIRU, GOBBLER, UTSCAN, VIRSCAN
CryptLab    ANTIVIR, CATCHMTE, F-PROT, FINDVIRU, UTSCAN, VHUNTER,
            VIRSCAN
Dedicated   ANTIVIR, CATCHMTE, F-PROT, FINDVIRU, GOBBLER, UTSCAN,
            VIRX, VHUNTER, VIRSCAN
Fear        ANTIVIR, AVP, CATCHMTE, CPAV, F-PROT, FINDVIRU, GOBBLER,
            UTSCAN, VIRSCAN
Groove/EXE  CATCHMTE, F-PROT, FINDVIRU, GOBBLER, VIRSCAN
Groove/COM  ANTIVIR, CATCHMTE, CPAV, F-PROT, FINDVIRU, GOBBLER,
            UTSCAN, VIRSCAN
Pogue       ANTIVIR, AVP, CATCHMTE, F-PROT, FINDVIRU, GOBBLER, UTSCAN,
            VIRSCAN
Questo      ANTIVIR, CATCHMTE, F-PROT, FINDVIRU, GOBBLER, UTSCAN,
            VIRSCAN

The only winners for all MtE-based viruses used during the standard
and the additional tests are:

CATCHMTE, F-PROT, FINDVIRU, and VIRSCAN.

During the acid test, FINDVIRU failed to detect all the 4 companion
MtE-based viruses. The other three scanners succeeded to detect them.

Therefore, the winners of the tests are:

CATCHMTE (freeware), F-PROT (shareware, free for individual use), and
VIRSCAN (commercial, but cheap).

This looks rather strange, since it seems logical that the big
companies that are producing anti-virus software have more time,
money, and human resources to put in research and developpment. Yet,
the commercial scanners usually showed worse results in MtE detection.
Obviously, they are popular not because of their quality, but because
of their flashy user interfaces and aggressive marketing strategies.
