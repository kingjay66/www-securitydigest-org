The source?! Are you sure? What we have here is a virus development
kit, which contains the MtE as a compiled, ready to link OBJ file,
together with a demo virus in source. As far as I know, the source of
the MtE itself has not been made available.

A slight correction. You cannot just take an existing old virus and
make it polymorphic with the MtE. You need to modify it first, in
order to make it MtE-aware. This requires the source of the virus, or
at least an assemblable disassembly.

C'mon, let's be serious. There is no such virus against which there is
no protection. Any integrity checker that is worth the price of the
disk space it occupies will detect any polymorphic virus, including
the ones produced with the MtE. Of course, the MtE poses some problems
to the scanners.

Some additional information: Dedicated is the demo virus that comes
with the MtE package.

The guys at BRM (the company that produces the Untouchable) have
promised to provide a free detector for any MtE-based virus. Is Yuval

Subject: Shareware Detectors wanted (PC)

I'm a lab supervisor here at New Jersey Institute of Technology with
the responsiblity of keeping the computing environment as safe from
viruses as possible.  I am wondering where I may obtain shareware
versions of TSR virus detectors.  Currently we are testing the McAfee
products and some commersial ones also.  Since this is a public
university cost of a site license is a concern.  I would like the TSR
virus program to be able to detect boot sector virus when a disk is
accessed, similar to the features of CPAV from PC Tools.  Thanks in
advance.  If I get enought response I'll post a summary.

   Oh, don't worry... :-) He has "cracked" a -very- ancient version of
   SCAN. Since then, McAfee Associates have changed several times (1)
   some of the virus signatures they are using, (2) the encryption
   method, and (3) the encryption strategy.

Some may have changed, some didn't apparently.  I compiled all the
strings into a simple program and ran some checkers on it.  They still
found various viruses.

But shouldn't we learn the lesson of the Godnet Raider?  Scanning for
known virus signatures has never been a good strategy for combatting
viruses and is now becoming obsolete.  Changing and re-encrypting
known signatures does not change any of the shortcomings of the
technique.  At best it just makes GR's list useless, at worst it
perpetuates the myth of the scanner.

   What really bothers me is that he succeeded to post on a moderated
   newsgroup... I would like to know how exactly he did it...

Not all that hard.  Consider that it was crossposted to alt.hacker.
This is a moderated group with no moderator.  This makes the group
self-moderated since if you can't figure out how to post to it you
don't deserve to in the first place.

   > You were expecting maybe a computerized Sherlock Holmes?  What else is a

   Well, a lot more can be done. Like better detecting unknown variants
   of known viruses (F-Prot), better reporting related viruses (F-Prot),
   exact virus identification (Dr. Solomon's AVTK), more flexible
   wildcards (HTScan/TbScan), etc...

The problem with the scanner is when people scan their disks and come
up clean they might think they really are clean.  If a virus has been
tweaked, changes itself, or is a new program the scanner is worse then
useless.

What are needed are better system integrity checks and monitors.

Subject: Stupid questions about booting (PC)

I've been reading this list for a while, and have some general
knowlege about boot sector viruses, etc., but there are some definite
holes in my knowlege.

Here is what I feel I already understand:

 - There are boot sectors on both hard disks and floppies.
 - If a floppy is in the A: drive when the machine is booted, the
   machine will read its boot sector even though the floppy may not
   be a bootable diskette.  If the floppy is infected with a boot
   sector virus, this action will infect the hard disk.
 - The partition table, which defines partitions on the hard disk,
   is in the Master Boot Record on the hard disk.  It may or may not
   become infected, depending on the virus.

Here are some of my confused loose ends:

 - What is the difference between the Master Boot Record and the
   boot sector?
 - Do only hard disks have Master Boot Records?  Or are they found
   on floppies, too?
 - If a disk has a Master Boot Record, does it *also* have a *separate*
   boot sector, or does the Master Boot Record house the boot sector?
 - If a hard disk has only one partition (e.g. a "C:" drive, but no
   others, right?), is there a partition table?
 - I assume that DOS's 2 hidden files are stored in either the boot
   sector and/or the Master Boot Record (MBR), correct?  Which one?
   What else, besides the partition table, and viruses, can be
   found there?
 - What exactly happens when the machine reads the boot sector?  Or
   the Master Boot Record?  For example, does it first look for DOS's
   hidden files?  Does it look for something else?  Where does it go
   next and how does it know where to go next?

If my questions cannot be answered the way I've asked them, could someone
recommend a good resource for me to get a clearer idea of what's going
on when a machine boots?

Thanks,
 -Libbie C.

Slightly faster?  According to Y. Radai's own numbers, IM executed a
full check ":28" faster than UT.  Using IM's time of 1:59 as a base,
this is roughly 25% faster.

For this purpose the user could use the full check. For virus
detection only the quick check (if not abused) works pretty well.
Otherwise why IM has a quick mode too? :-)

IM has the quick check for a totally different reason than UT's.
Actually IM calls it a "quick integrity update".  This does not do a
sampling as UT does, but provides a fast way to do a full check of all
files which are new and do a full check also of any files which show
signs of having changed such time/date stamps or file size changes.
The idea here is that it provides a fast way to bring your integrity
information quickly up to date and still do full known virus and
integrity checking on the files the IM does fully process.  The quick
mode is also of choice to people who are using Integrity Master to
manage change on their PC.  On my disk containing 9000 files in 500
directories (300mb), a quick update typically runs in approximately 10
to 25 seconds depending upon how many files have changed.

This statement is quite often interpreted to mean that UT can be
relied upon to provide recovery of all infected files.  While most of
us here in this forum, may understand that this is impossible unless
the files are backed up, the consumer may rely on this claim with
disastrous results when UT fails to remove a virus.  This to me, is a
serious issue not a mere nit-pick.

Have you read the review of Stealth Bomber of the March issue of VB?
It's just a retelling of the documentation of the product. No in-depth
analysis, nothing said that the product actually provides almost no
security and can be trivially bypassed (and is in fact bypassed by
some of the existing stealth viruses)...

I agree; I was quite disappointed in this review.  The following
review of a security product which prevents booting from the hard disk
was equally flawed by not mentioning how easily this protection can be
bypassed.

>  >I haven't seen the claim that it can disinfect *any* virus.  If that's

As I said, they didn't claim that, but did it in such a way, as to
mislead a lot of people. That's why most experts are angry at them...

I think anyone who makes claims which can have disastrous results for
their customers deserves more than just anger.  After someone
irretrievably loses some critical programs, will they feel better
because of "angry experts?

Please let me know what I can do to improve the user interface, make it
easier to user, improve network support. Let's talk privately.  Considering
the context sensitive help, the help index, the explanations that
automatically pop up
when you select a menu option in Integrity Master I find it hard to believe
that UT is easier to use.  Based on the comments
I've gotten from IM users who have used both IM and UT, I can state there
are many people who think the reverse in terms of ease of use.  So far your
comments have been very beneficial, let's discuss this.

Please keep in mind that Integrity Master has a different focus that UT.
Integrity Master is first and foremost a data integrity product.
After all other sources of damage such as software conflicts, bugs, and
hardware glitches are more likely to damage your files and sectors than
viruses.

 >One thing that extremely annoyed me was that IM seems to keep a
 >separate checksum database in each directory.

Integrity Master doesn't need to keep the integrity data on the same
disk with files that it describes.  There's an option selectable in
SetupIM which allows you to locate these files on another disk such as a
floppy.  An older version of IM did have a single database as you
suggest (and as are a result of your comments, I'm seriously considering
restoring the single database).  The feedback I got from my beta users
(this is over 2 years ago) was that they preferred the integrity files in
each directory.  Why?  Because this way when you backup or copy the
files in a particular directory the integrity data automatically goes
with the files. You can easily check that you've made a good copy.  I
think you are aware of the virus related implications of this and this
is one more area where Integrity Master is more secure that UT.

There are some other minor things, which can make the life of the user
easier. For instance, the creation of a safe diskette. IM contends
itself to instruct the user what to do and lists one example, while UT
contains a full analyzer of the hard disk's CONFIG.SYS and
AUTOEXEC.BAT files (yeah, even if it calls other batch files) and the
production of the safe diskette is fully automated... If it only
supported DR-DOS 6.0 too... :-)

Your suggestion is accepted!  One more item for my work queue!

and I still have various ideas on how to make even this go smoother ;-)

Integrity Master will continue to evolve and learn from its competition.

Subject: Re: Stacker and viruses (PC)

I wrote the following a few days ago:

	As I've said above, there is no reason to avoid Stacker
	or other compressing disk drivers out of concern over
	viral infection.

Vesselin Bontchev replied:

	Consider a virus which randomly overwrites sectors of the
	hard disk (e.g., Dark_Avenger.1800.Standard).  Suppose
	that it does the damage before Stacker's device driver is
	loaded (or alternatively, does the damage to the drive on
	which the large stacked file can be seen).  Overwriting
	just ONE sector of the file which contains the stacked
	volume will damage the whole volume - just like damaging
	a few bytes in the middle of a ZIP archive damages the
	whole archive.

Based on the understanding I have of how Stacker works, the above
isn't quite correct.

Stacker does =not= take your entire disk and create one huge ZIP-like
archive file out of it.  Instead, it takes "clusters" or "allocation
units" and compresses each of these separately and individually.  If
you consider that Stacker is supposed to be 99.9% transparent to DOS
(and thus must permit random disk access, including random access to
individual files of arbitrary length), you'll quickly realize that
this is the only way a compressing disk driver such as Stacker can
work.

In order to get better compression, by the way, a Stacker volume is
normally set up with a cluster size of 8K bytes (instead of the
2K-byte cluster size that is normal with hard drives).  The compressed
version of each 8K-byte data block is then stored as zero or more
512-byte sec- tors on the disk.  Stacker maintains its own map of
where each block is stored.

Now, if a virus such as Dark Avenger scribbles on a random sector
some- where within a Stacker volume, this will mess up the compressed
copy of some 8K-byte cluster -- but it won't automatically ruin the
whole drive.

Of course, if the nuked sector happens to have been holding something
critical, you could be in serious trouble.  To some extent, to be
sure, this kind of thing could happen with a non-Stacker disk
partition as well -- though (as Vesselin pointed out to me via e-mail)
a virus might be smart enough to avoid smashing the FAT or root
directory of a regular DOS partition, but not smart enough to avoid
doing comparable damage to a Stacker volume.

So, I stand by my earlier claim that compressing disk drivers such as
Stacker need not be avoided by people who are concerned about the pos-
sible effect of a virus.

It may or may not be a virus. What has happened is that the RAM copy
of some or all of your disk (directory) contents has gone amiss.  This
could be due to some conflict between cache software (or DOS loaded
high) and some other software, or a flakey (or temperature-sensitive)
disk, or a virus.  You should:

(1) Run a couple of good scanners on the system (boot from a clean diskette!)
(2) Try to remember what software you ran just before the fault showed up,
    and try running it again.
(3) If something like that occurs again, don't write anything to disk (i.e.
    don't add/delete/rename files, sort directories, edit files, etc), but
    look around to see if any other directories are affected.  You can use
    CHKDSK, but NOT WITH THE /F option.
(4) Run some disk testors, to look for flakey disk problems; Norton's DT is
    barely good enough - try the (shareware?) HDDIAG scanning for defects,
    (not analyze because it wipes the disk!)
(5) Run a heuristic analysis program on at least your hard disk's boot sector
(6) If it occurs again, let me know:
     * What scanners you used
     * If you used F-PROT 2.02's heuristics mode, what it said
     * Your config.sys & autoexec.bat
     * What program(s) you were running just before the problem
     * whether HDDIAG or DT or CHKDSK reported anythinbg wrong with the disk.
    (Some day soon I'll have a program that bundles all of this checking into
    one!).

In general, it is a good idea to at least run a modern virus checker
and some hardware diagnostics on your disk, reporting what they found
(or the fact they didn't find anything) with "Is this a virus?" type
of requests.

Subject: Filler virus & SCAN/CLEAN (PC)

I've run into an interesting challenge with the Filler virus on an
acquaintant's personal computer and would appreciate comments/info from
others who are familiar with this virus:

Environment:

	MS-DOS 5.0
	Intel 386
	5.25 ("A" drive)
	3.5 ("B" drive)

Antivirus software: McAfee Assoc. Scan and Clean 8.3B86

The virus was discovered on a 3.5 floppy that was checked with SCAN.
Upon discovering Filler, SCAN gave a message instructing the user to
reboot the machine, since Filler was resident in the memory.

The user rebooted his machine, ran SCAN on C:\ and it came up clean. He
placed the infected floppy in drive B and typed CLEAN B:\ [FILLER],
which also told him to reboot the machine, since Filler was again
resident in the system's memory.

Is CLEAN unable to remove a filler infection, or is it (filler) loading
into memory when he places the floppy into the drive (prior to any
command accessing the drive)? I'm considering trying w/ VSHIELD installed
to prevent the virus from loading into the memory.


I would greatly appreciate any suggestions or information about the
virus... McAfee's virus list just indicates that this virus apparently
is rather destructive;-(

The version I have seen only infects floppies and not the hard disk so
that it goes memory resident off a floppy and infects subsequent
floppies.  Powering down/up will cause it to disappear(provided the an
infected floppy is absent - of course).

A missing 1 Kb might by caused by:

1) A PS/2 computer. The PS/2 computers are set up this way for unknown
reasons. Maybe someone from IBM can comment on this.

2) A computer with American Megatrends Inc. (AMI) BIOS, which is set
up (with the built-in CMOS setup program) in such a way that the BIOS
uses the upper 1 Kb of the memory for its internal variables. It can
be instructed to use the lower memory instead. You have to play a bit
with the setup program (press <Del> while rebooting in order to invoce
it).

3) DOS 5.0 loaded high. It "steals" 16 bytes (one MCB descriptor) from
the upper part of the conventional memory. Since some memory snoopers
report the amount of memory in whole kilobytes, they'll report that
only 639 Kb are available in this case. In fact, it is 640 Kb - 16
bytes.

4) Some special customary BIOSes. I have seen a laptop with 3 Kb
missing. The BIOS used them for a built-in callendar and calculator.

5) A SCSI controller. Some of them "steal" one Kb from the top of the
conventional memory.

6) If you have a 386/ix installed and boot from its partition. I know
nothing about 386/ix, but I received a MBR from a user, who reported 1
Kb missing and I discovered that he's booting from the 386/ix
partition.

7) A memory resident virus.

The scanners (including McAfee's VIRUSCAN) are able to detect only
known viruses and minor modifications of them. Therefore, if it is a
new virus, SCAN won't detect it for sure. Try booting from a
non-infected write-protected system diskette. If the 1 Kb is still
missing, then you don't have a virus. If it isn't missing any more, it
might be a virus, or one of the cases above (3, 6). If you can't decide,
send a copy of the master boot sector and the boot sector of the
active partition to an anti-virus researcher.

Subject: Microsoft Word 5.0 Installation Instructions (Mac)

I read a short note in the RISKS forum about this, and thought I would
check it out.

In the "JumpStart" instructions for Microsoft Word, the first
instruction is:

  1. Make sure no programs are running on your computer that might
     interfere with installation.  Turn off startup programs (INITs)
     and remove virus protection programs such as Gatekeeper from your
     System folder.  Then restart your computer.

In light of the PC Michelangelo distribution-by-vendors problem, I'd
like to note this problem to the readers of this forum.

I just called Microsoft, and their support person said it is NECESSARY
to remove virus protection programs before installation.  This is due
to the fact that they use the Apple Installer program to install their
product, and the anti-viral programs will interfere with the
installation process.

Is this true?  Is it NECESSARY to remove virus protection to install
products such as Microsoft Word on a Macintosh???  What can be done to
allow virus protection to still operate on a system while an
installation is in progress?

Upon further examination of the installation process, we noted that at
no point does any instruction say to re-install any removed INITS or
virus protection programs.  They could AT LEAST add a note at the end
of the installation process, appearing on the screen when it instructs
the user to reboot the Mac, that reminds the user to re-install any
removed programs.

Oho! The second intentionally destructive Mac virus (the first,
Scores, was not that destructive for most people, after all)... Those
silly kids who ejoy creating these nasties seem to get evil in the Mac
world too... :-( I guess that we'll see more such events in the
future, especially with this Mickelangelo panic... :-(( I "feel" that
a lot of wannabe virus writers are dreaming now to create a virus,
which is to become as famous... This is one of the drawbacks of the
publicity about computer viruses...

A couple of years ago, I was bothered by this reference in Fred
Cohen's papers, since the page numbers given don't exist in any 1974
issue of ACM communications, so I tracked this paper down.  The paper
appeared in ACM SIGAPL: APL QuoteQuad, V. 14, No. 4, pages 163-168
(APL84 Conference in Helsinki).  The author, J.B. Gunn, happens to
work for IBM at my location, and he kindly provided a copy.  It has
very little to do with viruses in the sense that we use the term in
this newsgroup.  (Presumably, Fred Cohen was working with a very bad
photocopy.  :)

I do recall someone using the term "virus" for self-replicating code in
the early 80's, perhaps 1981 or 1982.

(If it helps, the numbers at the bottom of the first page of the paper
read 1984 ACM 0-89791-137-7/84/006/0163 $00.75)

There's a bit of confusion here.

Under Novell Netware (and I would assume under the other Network OSes)
the read-only attribute is *exactly* the same as that given under DOS.
Thus it is changeable by user software.

BUT... If a user doesn't have "Modify" rights in the directory (or to
the files under Netware 3.x) he cannot change the flag.

Likewise, if you do not have Write or Erase access to a
file/directory, you cannot change the files there. No virus running on
the PC can change this, as all the access to those files is via calls
to the Netware OS WHICH IS NOT MS-DOS COMPATIBLE.

A virus has to *ask* permission like any other program, and if Netware
has been told to deny it, that's all she wrote. Netware isn't
infectable via the LAN, only via running software on the *physical*
machine that is the server.

The one exception to this is if someone with Supervisor rights runs
something infected. But even then, it is possible to protect the files
to some extent. (for example, if a COM or EXE file is flagged 'execute
only' NO ONE can change it, not even the supervisor. It cannot be
read, only executed or deleted)

We once had a virus get loose on a few PCs attached to the network.
The infect only spread to a few files because the users didn't have
Write privileges in most directories that contained executables.

On the other hand, practically *everything* on their local HD was
infected.

While I've spoken of Novell above, I'd think that most of the other
LAN OSes out there should have similar protections.

   The most popular "historical" accounts of computer virus was the work
   of Fred Cohen, "Computer Viruses: Theory and Experiments."  He did a
   lot of work explaining what viruses are, and gave some of the first
   available code for explaining how they worked.  However, according the
   book "Computer Viruses, A high-tech disease," by Ralf Burger, 1988,
   publications about "worm programs" and viruses appeared in the U.S. in
   the seventies and early eighties (ACM Use of Virus Functions to
   Provide a Virtual APL Interpreter under User Control (1974)).  That is
   the earliest reference to computer viruses that I have.

In 1980 and early 81 after reading about the Xerox PARC "Worm" program
I came up with the idea of writing one for the Apple ][.  I succeeded
in writing a simple version of what we now call a boot sector
infector.  Actually it was a modified version of Apple DOS that when
activated with the "CATALOG" command would check to see if the disk
was infected, and then JSR (6805?) to the part of the INIT code that
copied the DOS to a new diskette.

Although self replicating programs like the worm and corewars had been
around I still claim this as one of the first Personal Computer
viruses.

I should point out before the lynch mob arrives that it did not
intentionally damage anything nor was it intentionally "released".  It
did get out at the computer lab at WPI and cause some disks to be
unbootable through an oversight.  Most likely carelessness on my part
since I worked at the lab.  I don't think it got any farther as I
killed it off when I found out and I never saw it on any lists of
viruses.

Subject: International virus symbol.

Is there an international symbol for a computer virus like there is
for a corrosive substance or poison ? Or does any one use one ? If not
shouldn't there be a concensus to agree on one... This would make
marking infected disks alot easier. Ideally the symbol should be
immeadiately recognisable as infected by a person who isn't 'virus
literate', or at least recognisable as something that shouldn't be
used.

Any thought on the matter ?

Thanks...

I've gotten several responses regarding whether or not to break the
FAQ into smaller pieces.  My thanks to all those who have taken the
time to voice their opinions.  My current (ball park) count places at
approximately 20 votes to leave it intact vs. 2 votes to break it up,
so unless I hear an outcry, the current strategy of leaving it in one
piece stands.

One note worthy suggestion (made by two people) was to post the
questions/table of contents to the group and to keep the entire

once or twice a year.  Comments on this idea are welcomed.
