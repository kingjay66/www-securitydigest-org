I'm a little confused.  Does a boot-sector virus, like STONED, infect
a floppy which is not bootable (command.com and system files)?  If
it does, can an unsuccessful boot (beacuse of the lack of system files)
with the infected floppy, in a PC with a hard drive, infect the hard
drive?

While that's true of the absolutely "vanilla" Stoned virus, which is
the most common type, there are a significant number of variants that
contain identical code, but don't contain the "stone" string.  The one
we've seen the most (we call it "Stoned-C" for some reason) has had
both the "Your PC is now stoned!" and the "LEGALISE MARIJUANA!"
messages overlayed by zeros; only a beep (0x07) remains.  Just
checking for "stone" will *not* find this variant, and this variant
*is* out there...

The Michelangelo doesn't contain any ASCII text at all, I'm afraid.
Is there some reason you don't want to use some commercial or
shareware/freeware anti-virus program?  It's somewhat dangerous to
assume that you'll only ever see the one virus you've already seen?

>Has anybody overcome this problem?

Not sure exactly what the question is - FixMBR has always been able to
handle very large disks - the "potential" problem fixed in v2.4 of
FixMBR and SafeMBR code v1.6 (never did hear any reports) concerned
disks using 1k sectors. The "large" reference was primarily in
deference to the fact that many people might not know what an ESDI
(Enhanced Small Device Interface) disk is. Myself, I have not seen a
disk of less than 330 Mb use 1k sectors, and none of these recently -
like I said, it was a "potential" problem.

In the MBR, the disk definition is carried in a doubleword providing
2^32 (approx 4 American billion) sectors or c.a. 2 gigabytes @ 512
byte sectors - enough for most people - this is how gigantic NetWare
disks are handled.  (at least this is what my calculator says & it
*sounds* right - no promises from memory 8*)

What happened in DOS 5.0 ( actually started with DOS 4.x) was an
increase in the FAT translation capability that has nothing to do with
the MBR or the Partition Table.

Earlier DOS versions were limited to 32 MB partitions unless "special"
and often incompatable mechanisms were used. Zenith/Compaq v 3.31 is
one example that is now emulated by DR-DOS 6.0 (if I read the manual
correctly).  Diskmanager's DMDRIVER.BIN is another, but this is a *DOS
FORMAT* matter & has nothing to do with BIOS activities (why MBR
viruses have trouble with 5.0 floppy boot records but not 5.0 MBRs.

Mixing and Matching don't always work because the different formatting
mechanisms do not always speak the same language. I know of no cure
other than reformatting (horrors!) or full conversion.

However, FixMBR adheres to BIOS requirements and partition table
specifications that did not change with DOS 5.0 so I suspect your
problem is with DOS & not FixMBR. In fact, the text sounds like the
question does not realy one for me - try your friendly neighborhood OS
manufacturer.

Well, yes - switch to 2.02!

2.00 is outdated - I released 2.01 in November and 2.02 last month.
The latest version is 2.02D - which can now scan most compressed
(LZEXE,PKLITE and ICE) executable files.

2.00 Has also a small problem regarding Michelangelo - The scanner
will detect it, and the disinfection works OK, vut the VIRSTOP program
may (on certain types of hardware) not alert the user if the virus is
active in memory, although the memory scan by the main program works
OK. This was corrected later, and 2.02 has been thoroughly tested, and
handles Michelangelo without any problems.

Subject: uh oh ... (PC)

Hi everybody!

I've got a question (which I hope has a simple and staight forward answer).

I've got a 386/40 PC, and for some reason, whenever I boot up my computer
from the HD I get a file called SIGN of length 0 in my root dir on C:.

When I boot from a (clean) write-protected floppy, I get an error
message that the disk in drive A: is write protected.

I've been unable to locate anything using either scan or fprot.

My first thought was that I was doing something screwy in my autoexec
or config.sys files, but I REM-ed out lines one at a time and then the
entire files and the SIGN file still shows up every time I boot.

All programs appear to run normally and I didn't notice any changes in
file sizes or anything else. Any help on this is greatly appreciated.

Almost. The Eliza virus adds 1193 to 1194 bytes to the infected COM
files, and the Copyright virus adds 1193 to 1207 bytes to the infected
COM files. My bet is that the person who asked you meant Copyright,
since it is recognized as Copyright [1193] by SCAN 86-B.

Both viruses are documented in VSUM 201.

Hope the above helps.

Nope, the responses were correct. The appearance of the files is due
to the fact the AUX is a device driver, and the device drivers are
files to MD-DOS. The "look like" files, even if they are not
physically present on the disk. Why they are found there is another
story, see below.

Yep. It is caused by a design bug in the old DOSes, I think. It is not
present in DOS 5.0 for sure, since I have noticed the same as Kathy in
the past, but now I am using DOE 5.0 and cannot reproduce the
situation. (BTW, it would help if she had dropped a comment what did
she actually do to "see" those files in each directory.)

As I think I mentioned in one of my previous postings, I think to
recall that I observed the same situation, when booting from an old
DOS version (I was using 3.30 then), and running Norton Utilties'
(version 4.5) program FileFind:

	FF C:AUX*.*

I got a report that the file AUX is "found" in each directory of drive
C:. The same was true for any other device driver - CON, PRN, LPT,
COM...

They are not really there. If you do a DIR on the directory, they
won't be found. I think that only FindFirst/FindNext using file
handles and wildcards were able to "locate" them. The number 112 has
nothing to do with the size of the device driver, just the appropriate
field in the FindFirst/FindNext buffer gets filled with some of the
bytes in the device driver, which are constant for each device driver,
different between the different drivers, but have nothing to do with
their size. My (wild) guess was that the length field gets part of the
device driver's strategy or interrupt entry point... Never bothered to
check anyway.

Anyway, there is no need to be worried, and the problem is fixed in
DOS 5.0 anyway.

Hope the above answers your question. If somebody has DOS 3.3 and FF
from version 4.5 of NU, could you please check and confirm or deny
this? And, if Kathy is listening, could you provide exact information
what have you done in order to see those files?

Vesselin

I would like to thank everyone who sent reassurance that the file

accused one of the professors at my college of infecting their
computer with a virus from a disk she sent containing a manuscript.
Their "evidence" was the strange behavior of their computer and the
appearance of the hidden file SD.INI with a date the same as when the
professor's disk was used for downloading the manuscript. It now
appears that our professor was entirely innocent. And the publishing
company has acknowledged that they use Speedisk.

		Michelangelo Virus on MS DOS Computers


February 6, 1992, 1400 PDT				     Number C-15
_________________________________________________________________________
Name: Michelangelo virus
Platform: MS-DOS computers
Damage: On March 6 will destroy all files on infected disks and
	diskettes that are accessed.
Symptoms: CHKDSK reports "total bytes memory" 2048 bytes less than
	expected
Detection: DDI Data Physician Plus! v 3.0C, FPROT 2.01, other
	anti-viral packages updated since late September 1991
Eradication: DDI Data Physician Plus! v 3.0C, FPROT 2.01, other

_________________________________________________________________________
	       Critical Facts about Michelangelo Virus

The Michelangelo virus, one of the most widespread viruses among MS
DOS systems, infects the Master Boot Record of hard disks and the boot
sector of floppy disks.  This virus will destroy infected disks on
March 6 (Michelangelo's birthday).  It infects very rapidly and
quietly, usually showing no indication of its presence until a virus
detection utility notes its existence.

Infection Mechanism

This virus is very similar to the Stoned family of viruses (see CIAC
Bulletin A-28 for a description of the Stoned virus).  When a
Michelangelo-infected diskette is placed in the A: drive and the
machine is booted, the virus is loaded into memory from the infected
floppy disk.  It then quickly infects the machine by moving the hard
disk's original boot sector to another location on the disk, and
installs itself as the boot sector.  From then on, any access to
another disk spreads the virus to that disk.  The disk which infects
the hard disk does NOT have to be a bootable system diskette to spread
the infection.  Also, all boot infector viruses, such as this one, do
NOT affect user files, therefore, a backup prior to eradication will
enable full recovery of all user data and programs.

Potential Damage

On March 6 of any year this virus will destroy all data on any disk
from which the machine is booted.  This occurs by overwriting hard
disk sectors 1-17, heads 0-3, tracks 0-255, or the entire diskette
with random characters, thus making recovery questionable at best.
Note that if your hard disk is partitioned and contains another
operating system, such as UNIX, in the area overwritten, that data
will be destroyed as well.  On all other days of the year this virus
lays dormant, merely copying itself to other disks.  The infection
mechanism of this virus may also cause read errors to occur upon some
high density (1.2 M) diskettes.

A problem can occur if a disk is infected by both the Michelangelo and
the Stoned viruses AT THE SAME TIME.  Both move the 'original' boot
sector to the same location on the disk, so when the second infection
occurs, the original clean boot sector is destroyed by being
overwritten by the first virus.  CIAC recommends a low-level format of
the disk if this double-infection occurs, although performing the
DOS SYS operation may repair a damaged diskette, and performing the
undocumented FDISK/MBR operation (in DOS 5.0 only) may repair a
damaged hard disk.

Detection and Eradication

Because the Michelangelo virus has been discovered relatively
recently, only anti-virus products updated since early autumn of 1991
will detect it.  If you suspect your PC has this virus and do not have
an updated version of a virus scanner, running CHKDSK will report a
"total bytes memory" value 2048 bytes less than expected.  For
example, a PC with 640 KBytes of memory will normally return a value
of 655,360 bytes, with Michelangelo that value would be 653,312.  Of
course, having less "total bytes memory" does not necessarily mean a
virus is resident on your machine, as some valid memory resident
programs can affect this value as well.

CIAC is aware of at least two publicized cases of this virus being
inadvertently distributed by vendors.  The vendors involved are
Leading Edge and DaVinci Systems; both vendors have made an attempt to
contact all recipients of the software involved.

CIAC stresses the importance of checking all incoming diskettes with
an anti-viral utility, such as VIRHUNT from DDI's Data Physician Plus!
package.  CIAC recommends that once a system has had a virus
eradicated, it be powered down.  The computer should then be observed
closely throughout the entire boot-up process.  Another virus scan
should be performed on the machine to ensure that it is devoid of any
virus.

Subject: Re: Polymorphic/Multipartite

Thought I'd chip in my 2 mils worth (2 cents - adjusted for inflation).

I looked up multipartite - among other things the dictionary said
    "divided into several or many parts".

Then I looked up polymorphic - among other things I read
    "having, assuming, or occurring in various forms, characters, or
       styles".

Polymorphic has been applied to two _different_ kinds of viruses; one
that performs different infective actions on the same host and another
that disguises its "signature" so it can continue to do a single task.

Multipartite has been suggested as an alternative for the first kind.
I like that.  It fits the definition just fine.

Polymorphic is (IMHO) a little too broad for what it is applied to.
Seems more like what you would apply to the (as yet non-existent?)
virus which can infect differing types of hosts (DOS, UNIX, etc).

Viruses which disguise their signature (in other words their appearance)
sound quite a lot like CHAMELEONs to me.  Wouldn't that be  a more
appropriate term for them?
                                       Just a thought.

Subject: Re: Polymorphic viruses

In my copy of VIRUS-L, roughly three paragraphs of my proposed FAQ entry
are missing. I fear that other VIRUS-L subscribers may have received
garbeled copies, as welle; hence, I re-submit said entry:

[Moderator's note: The moderator apologizes for inadvertantly wiping
out the three paragraphs.  The FAQ entry in my file is complete.]

Q: What is special about polymorphic viruses?  Why are they called
   "polymorphic"?

A: In order to eradicate a virus infection, all instances of this
   particular virus in various places (program files, boot records, etc.)
   have to be found and identified. A program to acomplish this task is
   called a Virus Scanner.

   A polymorphic virus tries to escape virus scanners by producing varied
   (yet fully operational) copies of itself.

   One method to evade signature-driven virus scanners is self-encryption
   with a variable key; however these viruses (e.g. Cascade) are not
   termed "polymorphic", as their decryption code is always the same and
   hence can be used as a virus signature even by the simplest, signature
   driven virus scanners.

   One method for a polymorphic virus is choosing amongst a variety of
   different encryption schemes requiring different decryption routines:
   only one of these routines would be plainly visible in any instance of
   the virus (e.g. the Whale virus does it this way, if I am not mis-
   taken). A signature-driven virus scanner would have to exploit several
   signatures (one for each possible encryption method) to reliably
   identify a virus of this kind.

   A more sophisticated polymorphic virus (e.g. V2P6) will vary the
   sequence of instructions in its copies, by interspersing it with
   "noise" instructions (e.g. a No Operation instruction, or an
   instruction to load a currently unused register with an arbitrary
   value), by interchanging mutually independent instructions, or even
   by using various instruction sequences with identical net effects
   (e.g. Subtract A from A, and Move 0 to A, have the same net effect).
   A simple-minded, signature-based virus scanner would not be able to
   reliably identify this sort of viruses; rather, a sophisticated
   "scanning engine" has to be constructed after a thorough research into
   the particular virus.

   The advent of polymorphic viruses has rendered virus-scanning an ever
   more difficult and expensive endeveaour; adding more and more search
   strings to simple scanners will not adequately deal with these
   viruses.

The file fprot202b on risc.ua.edu has been replaced by fprot202d.zip.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
The major change in 2.02D is improved ability to search for viruses in
compressed executables - the program can now search in LZEXE and PKLITE
(version 1.03 and 1.13)-packed files.

This method is not foolproof, but a considerable improvement, compared
to earlier versions.

I strongly recommend that anyone using 2.02A, 2.02B and 2.02C switch
to this version - it corrects a few (very minor) bugs in those
versions - those who are using 2.02 and have not bothered to get the
minor updates can just as well ignore this one too - 2.03 will be
released in early March.
