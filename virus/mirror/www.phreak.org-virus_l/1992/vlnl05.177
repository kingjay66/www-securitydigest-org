   This does make sense. Considering that many people run only a few
programs on a regular basis, those programs would be the ones
affected.  Of course, if the virus looks for its victims, then it
would spread to other programs as well. Many common resident viruses
infect on load/exec or open/create, instead of findfirst/findnext; so,
this is not the case. If you have a fast infector that monitors FF/FN,
and you happen to run a program like "tree", it would be quite
interesting :-) Similarly, a virus scanner could very well spread the
infection if the virus is active and the scanner is not aware of it.
Or if the user forced the scanner to skip the memory scan, the same
thing could happen. I still argue that memory scan should NOT be
optional. It is useful during testing to be able to turn it off, but
to the end-user (who may not be familiar with handling viruses), it is
a dangerous option.  And use of dynamic decoys should be considered,
even if they are limited.

   Well, well. . . Yet another philosopher among us :-) But don't mind
my making an observation sir. Your "theory" has been suggested long
long time ago by others: "If all you have is a hammer, everything
looks like a nail."  Or something along those lines. Let us not
exaggerate the utility of anti-viral software. It is usually an alert
user who discovers the beast, even without an a-v product. After that
discovery, they bring in the big guns. Many organizations still lack
adequate a-v protection today. My theory is that if one is involved in
a field for too long, one might start to get into the habit of
self-congratulation, or even congratulating each other without good
reason. It's human nature I guess :-)

   Hmm... I was not familiar with the theoretical work conducted at
Norton, but I just found out that you indeed engage in such endeavors
:-) Keep up the good work.

   Jokes aside, I'd like to mention a recent paper from Cohen,
published in Computers & Security:

   "Defense-in-Depth Against Computer Viruses" by Frederick B. Cohen
   Computers & Security, 11 (1991) 563-579
   
   Some sections include:
      A Multitude of Broken Defenses, Coding Techniques, Optimal Detection 
      and Infection Limitation, Automated Repair, Fault Avoidance Techniques.
   
   Dr. Cohen's coverage of the material is fairly broad yet concise.
Curious individuals are recommended to take a look at it. You might
learn something.  Here is one: "... for small files, deriving CRC
coefficients is trivial; and for "empty" files, CRC codes may show the
CRC coefficients directly."

Hmm.  MtE detection is difficult, but there are a few things that one
can look out for in order to help you get a staart if you are writing
an MtE detector, without having "big labs" and stuff.
 
One, as someone kindly pointed out at one time, I forgot where I saw
it, but the MtE can only generate certain code.  It can't generate a
variety of instructions, and any program which begins with these
instructions cannot possibly be infected.
 
Two, the MtE always has certain markers.  For example, the end of the
decrypting algorythm always ends with JNZ.
 
If you have a disasssembler, or even debug, you can spend a few hours
and figure out how to take care of a variety of infections.

I'll agree there, but the point in the matter is that ANYONE can

Subject: Happy anniversary to IT (PC)

IT has now run for 3 years without any known virus bypassing the
defenses.

Although we have made improvements over the last 3 years, it is
somewhat amazing to us that none of the over 1500 new viruses
discovered in the last 3 years has been able to bypass our version
from late 1989.  Many get part of the way through, and some get to the
point where the syst is allmost unuseable, but none have gone
undetected, and none have been unrecoverable!

Generic virus defenses seem to have become reasonably matured..

By the way, unlike the scanner developers, ASP has continued to
publish the details of how to design a strong generic virus defense.
AS a result, we have several strong competitors who are always chasing
us, and always outselling us.  The reality is that in this commercial
world, our software copyrights do not protect us from this, and since
Patents are too expensive and unstable in the software world of today,
the ONLY protection that works is the protection of being owned by a
big rich company.  (With the reverse engineering ruling of late, we
cannot even maintain any trade secrets in our software since or
competitors are freely allowed to disassemble our software and design
the same thing over using our methods).

For the above reasons, I daily deal with the problem of providing
information on how to build better defenses vs. protecting my income
by keeping our techniquers secret.  Unlike those at a University or a
big company, it directly impacts my income (in a negative way) every
time I publish a paper on virus defenses.  In my opinion, everyone
should submit their techniques to a refereed journal.  The reason is
simple.

	In the scanner world, a 6 month lead time is plenty, and that
is how long (at a minimum) it takes before your article gets published
in a journal.

	The only problem is the reviewers, who have historically
published my results (and probably others as well) in non-refereed
forums before my papers got to press.  If the reviewers (who are
anonymous) don't have the integrity to maintain the confidentiality of
papers before they are published, the system fall apart pretty
quickly.

	Oh well, I have digressed enough from my happy anniversary
message.  Have a nice malicious-virus-free day.

? Not sure why you say that.  Any unencrypted instance of a virus that
uses the MtE will contain the MtE itself in the file.  Just doing a
thorough scan for a signature from the engine will then detect the
infected file.  That's what we do, and it works.  (Of course, any
brand-new virus can have some brand-new method of encryption, and
therefore not be detected by a known-virus detector, but that's well
known, and has nothing to do with the MtE itself.)

First, SCAN missed 319 out of 15,994 replicants of 7 viruses. Second,
between the missed replicants there were representatives of EACH of
those 7 viruses, which proves that SCAN was unable to detect reliably
ANY of those 7 viruses. Even if we accept the excuse that you didn't
have some of them (which is unacceptable, because I already explained
how they all could be trivially detected, even if you don't know
them), do you mean that you didn't have ANY of those 7 viruses?

For me the above means that SCAN 97 is NOT able to detect -reliably-
ANY of the currently existing MtE-based viruses. And this is exactly
what I said in my message. Unless, of course, you mean my previous
message, in which I stated that SCAN 95b does NOT detect the MtE-based
viruses in ANY infected EXE files AT ALL, which is also true.

Regardless which of my messages you meant, they are both true and I
have facts that prove both of them. If you consider my message about
those facts to be alarmist, you are free to think so. Try to explain
it to your users. But please, don't object the facts. The facts are
that SCAN is still unable to detect reliably ANY of the MtE-based
viruses. It was my duty to warn its users about this.

I am not arguing about how widespread the MtE-based viruses are. They
are not. What I am arguing about is that SCAN 97 is not able to detect
reliably ANY of them. For a known virus, there is no such thing as
99.8% detection. You either can detect it, or you cannot. Try
explaining your users that they should not be alarmed, because SCAN
misses "only" about one infected file in every 50. Besides, 319 missed
samples of 15,994 is 98% (not 99.8%), i.e. one missed sample in every
50.

OK, I'll use this wording the next time. But I will not miss to say
that "SCAN version xx missed X out of Y samples of the Z virus, which
means that this version of SCAN is NOT able to detect the Z virus
reliably. I've notified McAfee Associates of the problem and they will
(hopefully) fix it shortly."

More exactly, the article said that McAfee insisted that OLD versions
of the competitive scanners were used in those tests and that he was
quoted saying that he wants his competitors to show worse results in
such tests. To do otherwise might be worthless from the economical
point of view, but it would be honest from the human point of view...

You see? The main problem for me is that I cannot obtain up-to-date
copies of the commercial software as easy as of yours. Besides, NONE
of the commercial programs are so widely used as yours. Even in
Europe... That's why, the bugs in your program have more potential to
cause damage than the bugs in the other programs.

I hope so. This is one of the reasons for posting my message. Just

There is an easy solution for this. It is so obvious, that I really do
not understand why you are not using it. The solution is to pick a
scan string from the unencrypted body of the MtE. This way you will be
able to find the unencrypted replicants - even if they contain a virus
not seen by you. It is enough that it uses the same version of the
MtE. And the encrypted samples (of an unknown virus) you should be
able to detect anyway - with your generic algorithm for detecting
MtE-generated decryptors.

The above solution is not 100% fool-proof. I mean, it will be possible
to write a virus, the unencrypted replicants of which will not be
detected by the above method. But -none- of the MtE-based viruses that
have been created yet are using this trick. Therefore, had you used
the simple method described above, you would have detected even those
MtE-based viruses of the existing ones that were unknown to you.

Well, first I assume you meant 654336 not 654360 "total bytes memory"
or I'd be looking for a bad chip.

Next, I would cold boot from a clean write protected floppy with MEM
or CHKDSK on it and see if you get the same thing. If not I would be
concerned.

Then I would use DEBUG to look at the missing memory "D 9fc0:0 L 400"
should dump the whole k. (D 9fc0:0 with 7 sucessive "D"s will do the
same thing slower) If almost all zeros, it is probably a buffer. If
1/4 or more full of code, then I would be concerned, paticularly if
there were "interesting" ASCII strings. If all FFs then the chip is
not responding to that address range (really odd).

If really suspicious I would boot from floppy, capture the MBR, then
run FDISK /MBR and see if that took care of it. If not, try capturing
the DBR and run SYS. If this fixes the problem, send the captured file
to a researcher.

Write if this doesn't take care of it.

Well, they all are detected as viruses, which is a start.  I'll ask our
programmers if they can spend some time looking into that listing of viruses.

But it picks it up in some.  Which means the programmers are at least on
the right track, as far as a making a detector goes.  I'll ask them to look
at the detector for the it, then.  If they have any questions, can they 
contact you directly by email?

Frisk, that is a very serious problem.  It's quite analogous to the
reason why 100% detection of MtE based .COM infectors is necessary.
It can continuously reinstate infection of a computer (or network),
and if the virus does damage slowly, it can be disastrous.

Well, unfortunately there is no single string possible for all PS-MPC
generated viruses.  I have added detection of it, however, and I
believe version 2.06a (the latest F-PROT) gets them all - however, as
PS-MPC generates .ASM code, somebody could take the output and keep
modifying it, until my scanner misses it.  However, my heuristic
scanner would probably continue to detect it....

One note - even though the PS-MPC viruses are quite primitive, they
are "better" than the VCL viruses in one respect - they seem to work
properly.

Subject: What kind is it? (PC)

Either I have a virus or I'm just paranoid (or both I suppose).  I've
had trouble recently with my computer locking up on me for pretty well
no reason, it often happens while running Windows (but usually at
different times in it's run) and Escape from Wolfienstien 3-D, (of
course that could also be because these are the two things that I am
most often running) Can anyone suggest a scanner other than FProt or
McFee's Scan? I've tried The most recent versions of these that I
can find but no luck.

Thanks,

Did you try replacing the hard disk cabling?  It could be that you
have an intermittent break or short in the cables, causing the 1701
error to appear on the screen.

HI.
This my first post to COMP.VIRUS.

I am a third student at the University of Ottawa (Ontario, Canada).

I am writing a project on Computer viruses. The project should include
information on some kinds of viruses, and the packages available to
cure them.  The information I have is very limited. I would appreciate
if anyone who reads this post, can send me some information, and
guidelines.

I 'll take anything, articles, posts, suggestions ...

Please send the information either through comp.virus or  reply to me  
directly. Thank you in advance.

	In my copy of Cyberpunk, I read that he was sentenced to three
years' probation, and had a fine of $10000, plus 400 hours of
community service. Now he is working as a programmer at a software
engeneering reasearch firm in cambridge, Massachussetts. There was a
court of appeal, on march 7, 1991, but conviction was upheld.
	That's all I know. If people know more, please tell us. Thank
