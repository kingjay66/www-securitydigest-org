from PC computers better than SCAN 92 or CPAV but smaller than 1 mega-

Well, you could say that F-Prot is doing a good job, since SafeMBR is
a good-guy program, so perhaps F-Prot is being very clever in not
reporting it as suspect :-).

Seriously, though, it should be possible to have programs that simply
write to the MBR pass that sort of test - where it should fail is if
the program is part of a boot sector, or at execution time when the
actual contents of what it is writing are checked. However, I'm sure
it is simply much harder to write heuristic scanners to spot such
activities in executable files as opposed to boot sectors.

Since it is also possible (in fact possibly easier) to rewrite a
program to avoid scanners looking for particular byte sequences, you
really have to ask: "Is a heuristic scanner (or mixed method scanner)
going to be better than the conventional string match scanners?" ... I
think the answer is YES!

But I also that such scanners are a long way from the total answer.
It shouldn't come as a surprise to people that scanners aren't
perfect. You have to use them in conjunction with other anti-virus
methods. I expect to see a type of scanner much better than the
up-coming generation of heuristic ones, but even that could not, for
example, pronounce whether Norton's utilities (such as a disk editor)
is a virus or not... only software watching what is happenning can do
that. I am very surprised that such software isn't part of the current
generation of 386-based software.  Instead of a message like "An
application has just corrupted the system area, you'll have to close
down everything and re-boot!" we should be seeing "An application
tried to corrupt memory areas that don't belong to it, do you want me
to nuke it?" (or words to that effect).

(This discussion is getting interesting, at last!)

In a recent arcticle [New Scientist no.1813 p48] the author stated
"...some viruses may transfer from floppy to hard disk DURING
FORMATTING" {caps mine}.

As far as my little knowledge tells me, this cannot be. I h ave yet to
find a virus description that aludes to this. I suppose theoretically
it is possible, but so is walking through walls. Has anybody heard of
such a virus?

Thanks in advance.

 In our computer lab we run 386SX computers, MS-DOS 5.0 and with same

fine.

 Try to change the VSHIELD options - may be it will help?

Subject: Is this a virus? (PC)

I have found a possible problem with my computer.  Sometimes my GMOUSE
pointer on MS Windows 3.0 seems to be a little lethargic.  It just
doesn't want to move (no other processes are running).  Is this a
possible virus problem?  FPROT 2.02 does not seem to think so.  It
could also be my mouse, although it is relatively new and I have
cleaned it just to make sure.

Exactly!  My complaint was mostly a quibble with the fact that they
gave no clue as to how easily access to the hard disk could be
obtained.  In evaluating a security product, it's critical to be
able to assess the amount of work required to bypass it.  I would
have liked to have seen a better indication of this.

That's true; we can't blame the developers directly, can we?
I have a few products marketed by an independent company and I
insist on maintaining control over how they are presented to the
potential customer (packaging, advertising etc.).  I guess this gets
into a moralistic question.   Do we as programmers just write our
code and then turn it over to others to do with as they please?? I
contend that we have a responsibility to see that the technology we
create is utilized in an appropriate way. (Pardon me if I'm getting
a bit too moralistic or perhaps off topic for Virus-L)

I agree!  There's no one right answer, plus we all benefit from
advancement in technology.

McAfee's ViruScan 8.3V86B has a bug in it (or more likely, an error in
the scanning strings) which causes it to identify the "Stoned" virus as
"No-Int Virus [Stoned]."  Also, when CleanUp is removing this virus, it
reports "Found No-Int Virus [Stoned]" and "Found Stoned Related Virus
[Stoned]" both, but only "1 virus removed."  This has been reported to
McAfee Associates.  I don't know how SCAN, CLEAN, or VSHIELD 86B treat the
REAL "No-Int" virus, since I don't have a copy of it.  You can use a disk
editor (Norton, PC-Tools, etc.) to look at an infected boot sector to see
which virus it actually is -- "Stoned" will have "Your PC is now Stoned!
LEGALISE MARIJUANA!" or something close, but "No-Int" will not.

"Stoned" and "No-Int" infect a PC's hard disk when a machine is booted
from an infected floppy, either intentionally or accidentally, and
regardless of whether the floppy is completely bootable or not.  Once
there, it will be loaded on every boot from the hard disk, become resident
in memory, and reduce "total bytes memory" (as reported by CHKDSK) by 2048
bytes.  From there, it will infect EVERY floppy accessed in the A: drive,
even by doing so little as a DIR A:.  "Stoned" has no activation date or
intentionally destructive payload, though it can, by the way it infects
disks, can cause damage, ranging from lost files to a corrupted FAT,
depending on the system, diskette density, and hard disk format.  "No-Int"
is less likely to damage a high-density diskette, but it does have a
simple stealth capability -- it prevents access to the boot sector when
it's in memory.

To clean the virus from the hard disk, you must first boot from a known
clean boot floppy, then remove the virus from the drive.  Often, a
recurring infection will result from attempting to remove the virus from
the hard drive without first booting from a clean floppy, or from not
cleaning ALL of the associated floppies.  Remember, it takes only ONE
infected floppy to start it back up again.  If it had overwritten part
of the directory, you may be able to use CHKDSK /F to recover those
files which had their directory entries wiped out by the real boot sector.
If it had overwritten part of the FAT, good luck.  Most likely only a
person very experienced at disk recovery or a restoration from a complete
backup can help.

As for why VSHIELD won't recognize it in Mr. Hogan's case, I don't know.
Since the scan strings for SCAN and CLEAN are faulty, it's possible that
the strings for VSHIELD are faulty, too.  It may also be possible that
the strings these programs use were accidentally matched to the "Stoned"
virus, and Mr. Hogan has the REAL "No-Int" virus.  Aryeh, do you have an
idea on this?

I have not observed the identification problem Mr. Hama reports, that
SCAN 86B mislabels "Michelangelo" as "No-Int."  SCAN 86B identified
"Michelangelo" as "Michelangelo Virus [Mich]" for me, and CLEAN 86B
successfully cleaned it.  Perhaps there is another strain of
"Michelangelo," or Mr. Hama's copy of "Michelangelo" was damaged in such
a way to cause the misidentification.

"Michelangelo" is not a strain of "Stoned," because it is too different,
but it is close enough for analysts to say that it may be a poorly hacked
version of "Stoned."

> Maybe Stoned/No-Int is corrupted.  Can I get my money back?

"Stoned" and "No-Int" are distributed on an as-is basis.  No warranties
are either expressed or implied.  However, the authors SHOULD be held
responsible for any damage resulting from the use of these programs. ;-)

Subject: Virus protection in general

One thing that I think stops viruses very efficiently is to use
electrically write-protectable hard disks for the programs, and
regular writeable harddisks for the data and memory swapping. This
will probably be the best way to limit the virus attacks on the hard
disks. The write protection is usually occuring on floppy disks, but
there are a few hard disks that allows it too.  Most minicomputer
disks do it, and a few removable PC disks like the Passport plus
removable media. If we all try to tell the hard disk manufacturers
that we want a write protection option on the hard disks, I think that
they will let us have it as an add-on feature.  This option will be
very welcome at some sites, especially military ones.

that its operation is based on analyzing viral behavior rather than
just looking for known byte sequences extracted from virus samples.
   VDS can catch the most evasive "stealth" viruses even when they are
active in memory.  A unique feature of VDS is its decoy launching
mechanism. The decoys are used to lure any viruses active in memory
and to capture them in a POV (Prisoner Of VDS) file for examination.
The centerpiece of the package (VDS.EXE) is an integrity checker for
hard drives.
   The package includes a special utility (VITALFIX.EXE) to recover
from most system infectors that target vital areas of hard and floppy
diskettes. Another program (VDSFSCAN.EXE) allows users to search DOS-
compatible (including network) drives for known viruses. Both programs
sport an easy-to-use menu-driven user interface with context-sensitive
help. The documentation is full of much EYE-OPENER information and is
a must-read for anyone looking for an anti-viral solution.

P.S.: VDS is not another trivial exercise in pattern-matching!

                    Antiviral checklist - part 8

                          For each office: (cont.)

_ Log of disks/programs received (cont.)

Last weeks column dealt with the difficulties arising from a policy
intended to keep "pirated" software out of an organization, and to
ensure that software publishers were paid for their efforts.  In
fact, the policy was ignored by obtaining evaluation software "under
the table".  In the end, all it did was prevent publishers who had
standardized policies for review software from competing in reviews
by local offices.

Federal government policy also provides for tracking of all inventory
through accession numbers.  The system works well for desks and cars,
but not so well for computers and software.  (I had a hard time
convincing the "materiel [sic] management" people in one office that
it did not make sense to issue one accession number to twelve video
cards, but it did make sense to issue one number to one card, three
disks of setup software and one manual -- for the same card.)
Because of the difficulty in putting items into inventory (obtain the
inventory coding for the item, obtain an accession number, affix a
label -- you ever try to find space for a 2cm by 6cm label on a video
card? -- and enter up to 46 fields of data into the inventory data
base - by paper form, since only two people in the local office have
access to the data base itself) very few software related items were
ever entered into inventory.  Data disks were never labelled: after
all, what do you do with a carton of 100 blank disks, which are
probably headed for thirty different offices?

In order to effectively track infections, however, even data
diskettes and customer data diskettes have to be identifiable.  The
system for doing so must be easy, must not interfere with normal
work, and must be *rigorously enforced* -- _by_ _the_ _users_.

The trouble with most policies of this type is that these
considerations are not "designed in" from the beginning.  Trying to
make transitory computer materials fit an inventory system designed
for permanent fixtures, or forbidding the entry of disks into the
company, simply means that people will ignore the policies in favour
of greater productivity.  The specifics of recording and tracking
will have to vary with the corporate climate and culture.  If an
intent, and some relevant background, is presented to employees
(rather than a mandated procedure), the users will come up with a
solution ... and one that is far more effective than those imposed by
head office.
