Subject: FORM Virus picked up in Amsterdam airport (PC)

A colleague (without internet access) tells me that one of his fellow
employees (they work for a gov't utility) picked up the FORM virus
while using a PC provided for general use in an airport "executive"
lounge in Amsterdam.  It did not spread after his return to Manitoba
(Winnipeg) as he was belatedly suspicious and checked a diskette he
had used in Amsterdam with McAfee (V84).

This is second hand information, so I don't have any other specific
details, but it occured on approximately June 30th.

The "state of the art" method of virus defense is not to depend on a single
method, such as a scanner, since it is too easy for a virus to sneak by
just one method of protection.  Rather, a multilayered defense is needed.
See the bottom of this article for a quick review of what I see as the
"layers".

A most basic defense would include:
  + A clean, write-protected bootable floppy disk.  A DOS master disk works
    well for this.
  + A TSR virus scanner that starts up whenever the computer is turned on.
    I recommend Frisk's F-Prot, a free* program available via ftp.
  + A non-TSR scanner to identify an infection.  Again F-prot seems best.

*Free to single users in a non-commercial environment.

ALWAYS boot from a clean disk before starting any scanning!  I would suggest
that a beginning user not even INSTALL the scanner onto his hard disk-- it
is quite a risk, since if the scanner gets infected and the person scans,
that infection will spread to EVERY FILE ON THE HARD DISK!

A more secure defense includes the above plus:
  + A write-protected floppy with a virus scanner on it.  This is often a
    bootable floppy, so it covers the bootable disk requirement, above.
  + Keep a backup copy of all programs as you install them.  This means
    saving the original .ZIP files from shareware programs and keeping the
    original installation disks for commercial programs.  Write-protect them
    and keep them in a safe place.

The most secure defense that I would find feasible is all of the above plus:
  + An integrity-checking program such as Integrity Master.  This requires
    some in-depth knowlege to be truly effective.
  + "Bait" files to catch viruses that may be in memory.  (unreliable and
    generally suited only for snagging a sample of the virus for analysis.)
  + Heuristics analysis (from F-Prot) to find unknown viruses.  It is
    necessary to generate a "clean-system" report (preferably hard copy) since
    this method generates lots of ambiguous messages, and the user will need to
    know which messages are "normal".
  + A disassembler/debugger to look at the actual program code.  Very
    technical, but virtually foolproof.
  + A complete routine-backup system of all new or modified files.

All of this can be summarized into these "layers" of defense:
  1) Clean system memory-- assured by the boot disk
  2) TSR scanner-- constant checking for known viruses
  3) Integrity Checker-- periodic checking for program corruption (covers
     known and unknown viruses, plus non-virus related corruption like disk
     errors or self-modifying programs.)
  4) Non-TSR scanner-- periodic checking to identify known viruses
  5) Heuristsics-- periodic checking for many known and unknown viruses
  6) System Familiarity-- constant checking for unusual activity (see below).

Often overlooked, but still important is familiarity with your computer.  If
you've booted your computer a hundred times with the same configuration,
you're bound to get a "sense" of how long it ought to take.  If something
changes this, like a boot sector virus, something will seem "wrong".  Then
you know it's time to pull out the scanner.  (After rebooting from your
floppy, of course.)  Maybe Windows seems to take a bit too long to load
up, or perhaps you saw an extra drive-access flash after exiting Kermit.
All of these are cues to reboot and check.  Maybe it's nothing!  Maybe not.
It's pretty easy to check.  (A whole lot easier than picking up the pieces
of your hard disk afterwards, even WITH complete backups.)

For starters, get F-prot and put together a bootable floppy.  This will
give you a high degree of protection with a minimum of inconvenience.

So, Mike, you're saying you had a disc full of pirated software, and a
virus burned you? Didn't even back it up after you bought it, or clean
it off?

It's quite possible that something on the system was infected when you
bought it. Did you scan it immediately upon purchase? Did you ask the
seller for the manuals and originals for all that neat stuff on it?
Did you happen to run any of that stuff for the first time right before
the problems showed up? No telling what was on there....at least, not
any more.

Subject: Rapid rise of the FORM virus; why? (PC)

Going through the quarterly statistics, we notice that the FORM virus
seems to have taken off in the last six months or so.  Does anyone
know of a massive shipment of FORM-infected diskettes or anything
similar that could help account for it?  It's been around for some
time, and we've had a steady trickle of reports from Switzerland, but
in the last couple of quarters it's risen rapidly in the data.  We'd
like to find some hint as to why!

I've been watching on OAK.OAKLAND.EDU, one of the usual sites for

No pressing need right now just like to have the latest and GREATEST

Thanks in advance for any help!

Subject: Warning: dangerous bug in SCAN 93 (PC)

Hello, everybody!

Just before leaving for my holidays I performed the tests of running
the three major scanners (Dr. Solomon's Anti-Virus ToolKit, F-Prot,
and McAfee's SCAN) on our virus collection. When browsing the results
I suddenly noticed a problem which is probably caused by a bug in
SCAN.

The bug consists in the following: SCAN does not detect some viruses
in all infected files! Note that I am not speaking about not detecting
some variants of viruses that it normally detects. I am speaking about
the fact that some viruses are detected only in some of the files
infected by them.

I think that it is obvious why this is a dangerous problem. During the
scanning of new software it may cause an old virus to pass undetected.
During scanning of an infected system it may case some infected files
to pass undetected and to cause a re-infection.

This problem has been already mentioned in the discussion about
detection of the MtE-based viruses. BTW, SCAN 93 is still unable to
detect MtE reliably - it missed Groove and Questo (two MtE-based
viruses). I didn't have the time to run it on a larger set of MtE
mutations, but I have the strong feeling that it will miss some again.

Anyway, the viruses that caused the problems were the following:

Standard CARO virus name:	Name that SCAN uses:
- -------------------------	--------------------
Good_Bye.Hero.506		Fam3 [F3]
Mayak				E-92 [E92]
Slovakia.2_02			Slovak [Slv]
StarDot.789			Star Dot [Sdot]
Ten_Bytes			1554 [1554]
Tumen.2_0			Tumen [Tum]
USSR-707			707 [707]
Whale				Whale [Whale]

Some comments:

1) With the Mayak virus, SCAN misses the *.SYS files (this virus
infects device drivers too).

2) With the Whale virus SCAN misses mutant #33.

3) StarDot, USSR-707, Ten_Bytes, and Whale are rather old viruses and
should be detected reliably by most scanners.

4) The fact that SCAN misses Ten_Bytes is particularly dangerous. This
virus is in the wild and has been accidentally distributed through
Valert three years ago. SCAN misses most files infected with this
virus.

5) I don't keep the old SCAN versions, so I don't know whether this
bug is present in version 91 or it has been introduced with version
93. I have not noticed it in version 89-B, however.

Unfortunately, tomorrow I am flying to Bulgaria, so I am unable to
provide any help to McAfee Associates (like copies of the missed
infected files, etc.). However, the fact that they detect -some- files
infected with these viruses means that they have a copy of the virus.
They only need to replicate the above viruses themselves and to see
why some files are not detected.

For reference which files are missed (and as evidence that it really
happens), you can used the report files from the tests. They are
available from our ftp site (ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de,
IP=134.100.4.42), directory pub/virus/texts/tests. The file that is of
particular interest is called FILEVIRS.REP and is contained in the
archive reports.zip. It can also be used as a cross-reference between
the virus names used by CARO and the three scanners, as well as for
reference which viruses known to CARO are NOT detected by each one of
the scanners. I wish I could post a summary of the results myself, but
I am afraid that I won't have the time to do it. Anybody who downloads
the files is welcome to do it and to post the results.

Regards,
Vesselin

Disinfectant 2.9 was released solely to handle the recently-discovered T4
virus, and does not detect ChinaTalk.  (Disinfectant finds only known
viruses, and must be updated for each new incident.)  ChinaTalk is
technically a Trojan horse, not a virus, since it does not spread on its
own, depending instead on unsuspecting users to pass it along.  Disinfectant
has traditionally not addressed the issue of Trojan horses, but you never
know... John may consider this one.

Subject: "Virus fighters fume..."

The article virus fighters fume over (The) little black book (of
computer viruses) by James Daly, quoted the reactions of experts to the
ethics of the publication of the book by Mark Ludwig which contained
real virus code.

The publication of viruses is reprehensible, in part because the author
cannot control how the virus will behave in the population at large.
Indeed, he cannot know enough about the population to even begin to
predict.  It is further reprehensible because knowledge of a virus is
essentially sufficient for its use; nothing else is required.  This can
be contrasted to the knowledge of how create an atomic explosion.  In
addition to the general and special knowledge, one would have to have
access to scarce materials and technology.

On the other hand, someone who publishes a virus on paper can expect
that it will spread more slowly than if it were published on diskette
and that it will require the conscious cooperation of an human agent.

Mr. Ludwig's defense is that "computer viruses are not evil and that
programmers have a right to create them, possess them, and experiment
with them."  Be that as it may, they are inherently dangerous; therefore
programmers will have to get along without the help of polite and
orderly people.  By selling viruses, Mr. Ludwig distances himself from
those people.  His action is motivated by nothing more than greed; he
deserves the censure and notoriety that will surely be his.

Computer viruses are destructive of that public trust that is necessary
and essential to our enjoyment of the benefits of computing.  We are all
somewhat poorer for the actions of Mr. Ludwig and his publisher.  Even
terrorists do not poison the well.

Hello, everybody!

I just ran the three major scanners (Dr. Solomon's Anti-Virus ToolKit
- - FindVirus 4.23 with drivers of June 11, 1992; F-Prot 2.04a; and
McAfee's SCAN v93) on our virus collection. The raw output of the
scanners, as well as the output preprocessed into tables is available
from our ftp site: ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de, IP=134.100.4.42,
directory pub/virus/texts/tests. Since the tables are very wide (220
characters per line) PostScript versions which print on an A4 page are
also available.

	File:		Contents:
	-----		---------
	naming.zip	Description of CARO's virus naming scheme,
			with a list of all malware known to CARO, its
			CARO name, and how the three scanners call it.
	namingps.zip	The same files as in the archive above, but in
			PostScript format.
	rawreps.zip	The raw output of the three scanners. F-Prot
			is also run in "heuristic" mode on the file
			virus collection.
	reports.zip	The output of the three scanners preprocessed
			in tables, showing the name of each file in our
			virus collection, the CARO name of the virus in
			it, and how each one of the three scanners
			detects it.
	reps_ps.zip	The same files as in the archive above, but in
			postScript format.

Since our modem is rather slow (9600 baud), ftp-ing the files across
the ocean is quite painful. I'll appreciate if somebody downloads the
files and makes them available at one of the major archive sites which
carry such stuff. I tried to upload them to cert.org, but without
success (probably messed something).

[Moderator's note: I've downloaded the above files and placed them on
cert.org in the pub/virus-l/docs/vtc/tests directory, under the same
filenames as above (all in lowercase).]

Installation

Vi-Spy was shipped to me on writable but protected media, low density 3 1/2"
and high density 5 1/4", but I have been informed by Ray Glath that this is
only for review copies: ordinarily the product is shipped on non-writable
disks.  An installation program is provided, as are instructions for manual
installation.  The automatic installation seems to consist merely of copying
and decompressing files, although it does check for viral infection before
proceeding and will refuse to proceed if infection is present.  Installation to
Windows is a part of the package, but in testing this was found not to work
effectively.  (An addition was made to the WIN.INI file, but no "icon" was
entered into the Windows system.)  (Ray Glath contests this: there is supposed
to be an additional step that the user is directed to take.  I ran the
installation three times and reached the same result each time.)

Ease of use

The various programs are easy to use, although the plethora of command line
options recommends careful study of the manual.  The on-screen messages are
quite clear, and contain good explanations of the options and possible
situations to the user.

Help systems

The VSMENU programs allow "on-line" reading of the documentation, and also
provides for additional material to be added by the user.  However, it would be
difficult to call it a "help system" as such.  The onscreen display is simply a
visual editor.  One would hope, for example, to be able to "search" the list of
viral programs: one cannot.

Compatibility

No problems were found in testing.  The primary test machine reserves an
extensive area at the top of memory.  In testing, this was identified as a
possible viral type activity.  The potential danger, as well as other possible
causes, were listed, but there was an option to proceed, rather than merely
reboot.

Company Stability

RG Software Systems is one of the oldest commercial (non-shareware) makers of
antiviral software.

Company Support

The company lists phone, fax and BBS numbers for support.  This is the first
time I have received a tech support callback before I received the software for
review.  Two days before I received the package Ray Glath called to apologize
for an unsatisfactory support call in which the caller had intimated he was
myself.  (I am by no means making fun of RG Software here.  It should be noted
that Ray Glath is one of the only producers of antiviral software who has
bothered to take advantage of my offer to "review the review" before I posted
it to the net.  (Another notable exception is Ross Greenberg who posted a very
gracious response after I stupidly failed to send him an advance copy.)  He did
so in writing and in depth.  He also offered to provide the names of a number
of referees as to the support RG Software provides.)

Only one mention, strangely for a scanning program, is made of the need for
updates.  However, that mention is that return of the warranty registration
provides the user with free quarterly upgrades for one year.  (Ray Glath
subsequently informed me that the user is informed at the end of the year, and
offered the option of continuing with update maintenance.)

The accompanying promotional material received with the package made strong
representation regarding support.  It stressed that many commercial antiviral
packages have been bought, rather than developed, by the distributors.  It is
good to see that RG is bucking this disturbing trend.  It also made much of the
written material, including a white paper and the "Primer" (see below).  The
white paper was a fairly straightforward presentation of observations with
regard to the viral situation, and a list of policy recommendations heavily
weighted towards "only buy commercial software".  (To be fair, BBSes are not
portrayed as universally evil.)

Documentation

There are two booklets that come with the package, as well as a number of files
on disk.  One of the books is a "Guide to Operations": the actual manual for
the program.  The manual is quite clear as to the installation and operation.
However, the layout gives a feeling of "clutter" and presents something of an
imposing front.  While there is a single sheet inserted into the front of the
manual which provides for quick installation, more effective protection
requires a thorough reading of the manual.  This should not be a problem for
any intermediate user as the manual is less than fifty pages.

The second manual is a "Computer Virus Primer and Troubleshooting Guide".
Accompanying forms and promotional materials allow you to order additional
copies of this booklet "as an educational/training tool".  While there is much
material of merit in the booklet, in the end it is simply more documentation
for the Vi-Spy program.  (There is, for example, no attempt to deal with viral
infections other than with an antiviral tool.)  It is, however, considerably
simpler to read than the "Guide to Operations".

Hardware Requirements

The only requirement listed is for DOS 2 or higher and at least 150K of memory.

Performance

In tests the program performed well and speedily.  Messages, and particularly
identification of viral programs, were quite clear.

The package appears to be very concerned with boot sector infectors, a very
good thing in the current climate.

Local Support

None provided.

Support Requirements

The intermediate user should be able to use this program very effectively,
provided time is taken to read the manuals.  The novice user should be able to
obtain a good measure of protection from the automatic installation, but will
likely require assistance in obtaining full advantage from the program.

                                 General Notes

Recommended for intermediate users.  Adjunct "changed detection" software might
also be desireable.  (In reaction to the review, Ray Glath informed me that
change detection is due in the next release of the product.)

Subject: VDS 2.10 is released (PC)

   Hello everyone,

   We would like to announce the availability of VDS (Virus Detection
System) version 2.10. We have enhanced the programs in the package
considerably. A fully functional trial version is publicly available via
anonymous-FTP and on many BBSes across the U.S.A. You are invited to try it
to evaluate its suitability to your needs before you make a decision.
We also would like to thank many people who took their time to offer
us their ideas for improving VDS. We have listened.

   Here is a brief description of each program in the VDS 2.10 package:

   VDS.EXE

   This is the centerpiece of the package that performs comprehensive
   integrity checks on hard drives and provides you with an early warning
   that your system may be infected with a virus. This is the first line
   of defense that can help contain the spread of virus infections before
   they turn into epidemics. The program includes many recovery features
   as well as an audit trail capability to help technicians track down
   virus entry points and isolate incidents quickly.

   VDSFSCAN.EXE

   This is a virus scanner with a very easy-to-use menu interface and
   context-sensitive help. It is compatible with DOS-drives including
   network drives that allow access to DOS programs. It can also remove
   most boot sector infectors. We do not recommend "cleaning" infected
   program files, and do not provide such a capability.

   VITALFIX.EXE

   This is a low-level disk utility that allows you to perform many
   operations to handle MBR/BR viruses. Although it is very easy to use,
   thanks to its intuitive user interface, only people who are familiar
   with the layout of a DOS disk should use it on a regular basis.

                 Differences between VDS 2.0 and VDS 2.10
                 ----------------------------------------

*   Improvements:

    * Now VDS 2.10 can handle DR DOS 6.0 drives as long as they are NOT
      compressed. It is aware of DR DOS password protection scheme, and
      it can peacefully co-exist. Read HILITES.TXT for details.
    * VDS 2.10 can work under MS Windows 3.0 & 3.1 (limited)
    * Works under 4DOS
    * Users can specify the path to their command interpreter during
      installation if they do not have C:\COMMAND.COM as primary shell.
    * File names are displayed in a window during checking, and a
      directory tree is shown on the screen.
    * VDS integrity checker can handle 1500 executable files per partition
    * Report file has date and time besides viruses found, and is not
      deleted, but simply appended to.
    * Audit logs for added, deleted, and modified files are combined into
      C:\VDS210\VDS-STAT.LOG; date and time are written each time VDS
      reports something, and audit log is appended to, not overwritten.
    * Documentation is revised to provide more information, less hype.
    * Decoy launcher provides more information on active attackers.
    * Decoy launcher offers to copy the captured attacker to user-specified
      file, preferably on a diskette.
    * Decoy names are semi-random.
    * Decoy launcher checks for "companion" type of attack specifically.
    * VDS integrity checker TURBO mode is slightly slower, but more secure.
    * VDS will not automatically add signatures to its databases, but ask
      the user first.
    * VDS integrity checker do not look for multiple infections in a file,
      but stops after the first one is found.
    * VDS integrity checker -SCAN option is removed.
    * VDS installation makes one pass to scan and sign files, not two.
      If an infected file is found, the user is asked to delete it. If
      it is not deleted, operation will continue so that other infected
      files may be located. VDS will refuse to install at the end if there
      are any infected files left.
    * System files (IBMBIO.COM & IBMDOS.COM or equivalent names) are
      checked as part of system verification as well as file verification.
      No recovery is attempted on these two files to avoid absolute writes
      to the disk. User is advised to run SYS from a clean floppy to
      restore these files.
    * MBR and BR is backed up onto VDS emergency disk as is, not encoded,
      so that VITALFIX can be used to restore MBR if CURE (rarely) fails.
    * VDSDEV.DDR is backup to the emergency diskette as well.
    * Any MBR/BR infectors caught by VDSDEV.DDR are examined and numbered
      by the integrity checker. Up to 10 can be tracked.
    * VDSFSCAN has five more options:
         LOG ERRORS: will write error messages to a user-defined file.
         NETWORK   : will continue to scan even if an access error occurs.
         WILDCARD  : users can specify a file spec like *.COM. ALL FILES
                     option is automatically set to YES.
         QUIET MODE: will not beep when an infected files is found.
         PAUSE FLAG: will not pause after each infection report.
    * VDSFSCAN has better context-sensitive help.
    * If no known infections can be found in a file, NONE IDENTIFIED
      instead of CLEAN will be reported. This is to emphasize that known
      virus scanning is only as accurate as the signature database.
    * Virus signature database is updated to include 35% more viruses.
    * Both VDSFSCAN and VDS scanner has MtE-recognition capability.
    * Operation of VDSFSCAN and VITALFIX can be interrupted by pressing
      CTRL-BREAK as well as the ESCAPE key.
    * VITALFIX has a new option to search for Extended Partition Records.
    * VITALFIX can preserve DR DOS security during new MBR construction.
    * VITALFIX menu options are more self-explanatory.
    * If the MBR code is intact, but the partition table is modified, then
      a warning will be issued; however, VDS will NOT attempt auto-recovery
      to avoid possible damage.
    * In command line mode of VDSFSCAN, copyright and licensee name do not
      scroll off any more.
    * Non-DOS partitions are ignored.
    * ESC will get you out of input fields as well as menus.
    * We included a simple batch file (REMVDS.BAT) to uninstall VDS 2.0.
    * VITALFIX is no longer copied to the hard disk during installation.
      Due to possible misuse, only PC-techies should have it.

*   Bug fixes:

    * If the partition table was not available, VDS would abort operation.
      Now it not only bypasses such viruses, but also recovers on the fly.
      If only the partition table is modified, then VDS will ask you if
      you would like to recover or not.
    * CURE option did not work in some cases.
    * Some hidden files were missed. Fixed.
    * TSRs that grabbed the hardware timer interrupt (08) would get chopped
      off even when not suspicious. Now VDS is less brutal to such TSRs.
    * VDSFSCAN would stop after identifying first infected file if the
      WHOLE option is set to YES. Not any more.
    * VDSFSCAN would miss a few viruses that append to EXE files; fixed.
    * On network drives, VDSFSCAN would stop if it came across an
      inaccessible file such as NET$OBJ.SYS. Now it will only issue an
      error message (log it as well if LOG ERRORS is set to YES), and
      continue. For this to work, NETWORK option should be set to YES.
    * VDSFSCAN output file name had to be 5 characters or more, making it
      hard to direct output to a printer. Now, you can specify PRN as the
      output file name to print reports as the scan proceeds.
    * VDSFSCAN needed two backslashes (as in C:\\) to scan the root.
    * VITALFIX and VDS would cause memory protection violation in some
      cases. No more. Try -Xclude option if necessary.
    * VITALFIX did not recognize non-DOS partitions properly.
    * On disks with more than 5 partitions, VDS would abort installation.
    * Blink problem on CGA color monitors is eliminated.

*   Other

    * Due to popular demand, academic site license now covers students
      as well as the employees of the school at no extra charge.
    * Both 5.25" and 3.5" diskettes are provided. No need to specify.
    * Pre-paid orders in the U.S.A. and Canada get free shipping.
