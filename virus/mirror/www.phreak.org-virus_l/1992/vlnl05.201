Subject: Virus that removes comand.com, config.sys, autoexec.bat (PC)

  Hi,

    We've had 3 machines here within the past two weeks when we try and
  boot them come up and say missing or bad command interpreter.  When
  we booted from floppy, we discovered that command.com was indeed
  missing.  The autoexec.bat and config.sys files were also gone from
  the system.

    Does anyone know of any viruses which might cause this and have
  any advice as to how we should proceed ?  I have already run
  the Macafee virus scan program and it doesn't find anything.

    Please respond by email if possible.

Subject: List of Trojan Virus Doctors? (PC)

 Sorry if this is answered in some FAQ that I haven't seen, but I think it
would be a great service to all if someone from the McAffee company, or
anyone who happens to have this information, would post a list of the
"skipped" Virus Doctors.
 That is, the version numbers of Virus Doctors that are unused due to people
finding Trojan Horse code in those copies.
 I mean, it's nice for the Virus Dr. people to skip those numbers when
putting out official versions of the program, but if they don't tell us
which are the ones they've skipped, it doesn't help much!
 Thanks.

No, you're thinking of VSTOP, which is used internally in IBM, and is
also available to people who buy the IBM Anti-Virus Service Offering.
The most recent incarnation of this code is as the DOS Session Shield
component of IBM AntiVirus/DOS and IBM AntiVirus/2 (it's no longer
called "VSTOP" there).

VIRSTOP is something else, I'm not sure exactly what.

        You may also check this out: If you have an IDE or SCSI or
some drive type like that, make sure the controller ROM memory
location is protected.  In system.ini, the command is EMMEXCLUDE
(address-address).  This will insure that Windows won't try to write
to that memory area, and thus send weird commands to the hard disk.
I've had this happen before, and the effects ar similar to what you're
discribing.

If it's a variant, it's a new virus and this line of thought is
meaningless.  A writer of a new variant has the available antivirus
products to make sure they do not detect his new variant so it doesn't
matter how you go about it.  He just doctors his virus, trial and
error, until it no longer gets picked up.

If it's not a new variant, we do detect those viruses that have the
capability of placing itself randomly in memory.  I did say "more
sophisticated."  :-)

I've just finished cleaning up an outbreak of the 1575 (15xx) virus.
I understand this is a fairly old virus, and while it was a new
breakout here, it seems to have been a delayed outbreak from another
educational site.

Anyway, by what mechanism is this virus spread.  I found compressed
(lzexe) files which were infected, and tons of executeables.  However,
I have yet to find anything which I could identify as the original
source.

Information in this regards would be of help.  Thanks

I recommend to check out the new TBAV utilities. I've just tested
them, and - what can I say - they're great. They really don't
interfere even with complex low-level programs after they're correctly
installed, don't eat up much memory and provide multi-layered
protection. They even prevent many stealth-type viruses from
tunneling. Not absolutely perfect (I got Armageddon to successfully
infect a file after allowing it to go TSR), but: nice game this time,
Thunderbyte!

Hello Vesselin!

You wrote about TBAV 5.01:

By default TBCHECK checks only the entry point of an executed file.
(You can set it to check the whole file's CRC, but that's documented
to be real slow.)  That's what I think to be the weakness, but could
you explain why? Are there many link viruses (guess that's what
TBCHECK is written for) which don't touch the entry point at infection
time?

BTW: I managed to have Armageddon infect a file after I allowed the
virus to go TSR, though I've activated the whole product palette.
What's that - a special way to put its code into a file, which TB
doesn't recognize?

[...your comments on calling Microsoft and Vesselin's re-posting of
a message about the CHKDSK problem deleted for brevity...]

Another way to check the revision of the DOS version is to make use of
the undocumented /R switch in the VER command.  This returns the
version and revision of DOS loaded as well as whether or not DOS is
loaded high.

For example, shelling out to DOS and typing "VER /R" reveals:

  D:\PCPLUS> VER /R

  The Operating System/2 Version is 2.00 
  Revision 6.427
  DOS is not in HMA

Heh heh.. Oops.  Looks like that is also supported by OS/2's DOS emulator.
Let me take another try at that:

  D:\PCPLUS> VER /R

  MS-DOS Version 5.00
  Revision A
  DOS is in low memory

There we go.  As you can see, MS-DOS Version 5.00 Revision A is present.

Subject: F-Prot won't clean... (PC)

I *suspect* that what you have is a simple STONED hack that just has
changed the real MBR resting place to something other than 0,0,7
(essentially a two byte change). I do not know if F-Prot uses a global
search for a valid partition table like my stuff (no names) but this
would tend to indicate that it does not.

The AZUSA virus does not bother to save the original MBR so when you
use CLEAN [AZUSA], I would expect this to be the same as CLEAN [GEN-P]
which is also essentially the same as FDISK /MBR since the only
assumption made is that the valid partition table is in sector 1 and
the MBR code is replaced by a canned program.

I am curious to know where or whether it did store the original MBR.

                                        Warmly,

There is an undocumented switch to the "ver" command...  If you type 
"ver /r" it will give you not only the version number but the revision
as well. Mine gives the following response...
 
    C:\>ver /r

    MS-DOS Version 5.00
    Revision A
    DOS is in HMA

There are currently no known viruses that run under native OS/2.
However, OS/2 DOS sessions are sufficiently compatible that many DOS
viruses function normally there.  So if your machine has DOS sessions,
you may get and spread DOS viruses. Even if your machine doesn't have
DOS sessions, it might inadvertantly serve as a vector for a DOS
virus, by transporting an infected DOS program, or an OS/2 program
with an infected OS/2 "fork" (the code that just prints "This program
requires OS/2" or whatever).  Also, an OS/2 machine can become
infected with a boot-record-infecting virus, since they are basically
operating-system-independant (they run before OS/2 is loaded).  For
technical reasons, existing boot infectors will not spread further
from an infected OS/2 system, but you still don't want the virus
around...

If a disk's SCSI ID is set to 7 (same as the host), the disk responds
at every SCSI ID (0-6) because the initiator asserts both addresses.
So, you'll see such a disk seven times on the desktop.

This is characteristic of a SCSI ID problem.  It's possible that the
drive is set to SCSI ID 7, which is reserved for the Macintosh itself.
If not, it may have the same ID as another SCSI device on the chain,
or the controller may be bad.

I would suggest not trying to write to the drive.  Aiming for the one
"in the middle" doesn't work as well with SCSI volumes as with
participants in drunken brawls. :-)

I normally just read the virus-l digest and restrain from
participation as there are many more qualified people to answer the
many queries, and there is usually a proliferation of such responses.
The above statement from Dr.  Cohen has, however, inspired me to send
this posting.

I have neither the extent of education or the wealth of experience
that is possessed by the esteemed Dr. Cohen, but am I alone in my
skepticism of the above concept?

The subject of benevolent viruses (or "good" viruses) has arisen on
this forum many times in the past and, indeed, amongst some other
professionals at various courses and conventions that I have attended
(including a very informative course given by Prof. Eugene Spafford).
Discussions on said subject always ended with the decision that it
seemed impossible to ensure the integrity of the benevolent viruses
and that should these be modified to become malevolent, they could be
far more dangerous than the usual "run-of-the-mill" virus as they
would be propagated with the users' knowledge.

I may be a die-hard skeptic, but I still have trouble believing that
Dr.  Cohen has created a benevolent virus that is immune to
modification - maybe, if you deem my inquiry warrants a response Fred,
you could put my (and probably many other peoples') mind(s) at ease on
this matter.

This is not an attack on Dr. Cohen, just an expression of concern over
a concept being used and even recommended by him.  In fact, I find his
postings to be informative and usually somewhat controversial which
has the side effect of promoting discussion - always educational!

I am surprised that you fail to understand what the readers and writers
are saying.  The fact is, we already know that a scanner will not detect
a new virus.  I could sit down and write a virus that any signature-based
scanner couldn't detect.  So what if you can do it, too?
   I know what the implications are:  scanners are limited.  We already

Maybe they have the intergrity not to spread these viruses around.  You
say that "only a small portion have ever been founf at a substantial
number of sites".  I read this statement as meaning that you have created
these viruses, and only a few of them have "gotten out".  To me, that is
irresponsible.  If you want to create research viruses, fine.  But if
you let them spread, than that is *not* fine.

Excuse me?  Since when did viruses have to be "bad" to be a virus?  Look
in the FAQ...there's a sentence there refutes the "belief" that a virus
has to be "bad" or "malicious" to be a virus.

Do you even know how a scanner works?  From the above statement, I am
beginning to doubt if you really do.  Unless you are talking about
heuristic methods, which are still in the experimental phase.  And
integrity-based systems let you specify which files are to be ignored
and which are to be checked.

We can draw some parallels here with genetic research. I have nothing
against experimentation with proper safeguards and have no doubt that 
yours are probably better than most *but you didn't say so*. I am sure 
that as a professional you have the capability to create a virus that
would be *very* difficult to detect as can any number of others. The 
difference is that I am reasonably sure that they *won't*.

I have a great deal of respect for your abilities but feel that such 
ability also carries an ethical responsibility that needs to have
equal weight and cannot be taken for granted.

This is true - I have never felt the need to create a fully functional
virus. Like most, I have examined quite a few and thought "I can do that
better" however everything I needed to prove could be done with code
fragments that provided a "proof of principle", some of which can be
found in my software - how many viruses can infect all four major
floppy sizes without problems of any kind ? SafeFBR and FlopSec can but 
are not viruses - or possibly they do meet *your* definition ?

IMHO what makes a virus a virus (e.g. the propagation function) is so
simple as to be trivial and not interesting at all.

Thought we explored this subject on Virus-l last year and the concept
was found to be a good one so long as the user was notified of what 
was happening and given the opportunity to decline (and be logged off).

I know of several antivirals that use this technique and have for some 
time.

I expect that the real question is one of sematics. There is a place for
controlled rules-based self-progagating code. There is no excuse for
code that propagates without control or that attempts to disguise the act
of propagation. From what I have seen of your vritings, what is being
called a virus is really a program that modifies other programs *designed
for that purpose*. 

Malicious software (what we call viruses) on the other hand, modify 
programs that were not intended to be modified, often disrupting 
systems as a result.

Like  was said, sematics, but not only are you using terms out of the 
generally accepted context, you are not defining your meanings, at least 
not for this audience.

I know, I have often made the statement "review the literature", but then
have tried to only quote readily available sources (usually ones I have
found at Walden's or B. Dalton's) and cite the reference.

Possibly this seems harsh but is meant to be constructive. We know that 
you are brilliant but seem immune to the outside world, striking out
with provocative statements designed to dazzle (or is it baffle ?). Please,
if you are going to post, take the time to learn the net's language.

As counterpoint: "In order to ask the question, you must already know most 
of the answer".

Was deliberately avoiding mentioning names since there had been talk about
"commercialization" of the net. In truth there are quite a few that have
been around for even longer, but to see which ones I use you are going to 
have to look up back issues since I am not going to mention Dr. Panda or 
Enigma-Logic either & Aryeh already announced VSHIELD's /CF switch 8*).
Fred can make his own announcement just like Tarkan and Yisreal did (and
would be pleasently surprised if it was as informative).

IMNSHO, the proper goal of a vendor should be to educate the public to the
point at which the superiority of their product will be evident. Sure there
are going to be "trade secrets", but they should be confined to *how* a
product does things, not *what* it is doing. If a product achieves
speed by checking only the first five (ten, twenty) bytes of a .COM file, it
is not going to be secret for long from anyone who checks. 

I really do not care what anti-viral program people use as long as it is
*something*. Sheer diversity is the hardest thing for a virus writer to
surmount and most of the front line offerings are "good enough" and all
are "getting better". Sure everything misses something and certainly
Fred or I or Frisk or Vess could write something that no present scanner
would pick up. As said before, my concern today is directed attacks
against a known target. They have the same vulnerabilties as assasination
targets, are not as mobile, and the attacker need not be concerned
about excape.
                                        Chilly isn't it ?
