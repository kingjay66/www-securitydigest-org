I studied the Stoned virus a long, long time ago (well, two years ago
seems a long time in this business)....

If you boot from an infected hard disk, you should not get the message
at all.  The most obvious symptoms may be problems with 1.2M and 3.5" disks.

However, if you boot from an infected floppy, there is a 1-in-8 chance
that you get this message on each bootup..

Hello all.

I recently heard of a (new) virus, called "D2". A friend of mine told
me that it is a new one, that cannot be detected by any of the
available virus killers (even TNT-VIRUS), and that the first symptom
is that the system does not recognize the existence of any available
hard disks.

If any info is available, please contact.

[Moderator's note: Attached is the Virus Test Center's catalog entry
on the Michelangelo virus:

==== Computer Virus Catalog 1.2: Michelangelo Virus (17-Sept-1991) ===
Entry...............: Michelangelo Virus
Alias(es)...........: ---
Virus Strain........: Stoned Virus Strain
Virus detected when.: Summer 1991
              where.:
Classification......: System virus (boot, partition table), resident
Length of Virus.....: 429 Bytes
- --------------------- Preconditions ----------------------------------
Operating System(s).: MS-DOS
Version/Release.....: 2.xx upward
Computer model(s)...: IBM - PC, XT, AT, upward and compatibles
- --------------------- Attributes -------------------------------------
Easy Identification.: ---
Direct Detection....: Original partition table or original boot sector
                         can be found in sector 7 of a hard disk,
                         sector 3 of 12 bit FAT media (5.25" diskette)
                         and sector 14 of 16 bit FAT media (3.25" dis-
                         kette).
Type of infection...: Upon booting from an infected floppy, virus will
                         make itself memory resident and infect par-
                         tition table. Any INT13 is intercepted there-
                         after. Any floppy A: operation will infect
                         disk in drive A: provided the motor was off;
                         this reduces excessive infection testing.
Infection Trigger...: Booting from an infected disk will infect a com-
                         puter. Usage of the floppy A: drive (read,
                         write, or format) can cause an infection of
                         that medium.
Infection targets:..: Partition table of harddisks and bootsectors
                         of floppy disks.
Interrupts hooked...: INT 13, INT 1A
Damage..............: Data destruction by overwriting the medium, from
                         which system was booted from: on harddisks,
                         virus will overwrite sector 1-17 on head 0-3
                         of all tracks; on floppies, virus will over-
                         write sector 1-9 or 1-14 (depending on FAT
                         type) on both heads and all tracks.
Damage Trigger......: Data destruction occurs when system's date
                         equals March 6 of any year; this is birthdate
                         of Michelangelo Buonarotti, Italian artist,
                         architect and engineer (born March 6, 1475
                         in Caprese, died February 18, 1564 in Rome)
Similarities........: Virus seems to be an enhanced Stoned virus
Particularities.....: ---
- --------------------- Agents -----------------------------------------
Countermeasures.....:
- - ditto - successful: Fridrik Skulason's F-PROT and Dr. Solomon's
                         FINDVIRU detect and eradicate this virus.
                         Also, McAfee V85 claims to test and clean it
                         (not tested).
Standard means......: Boot from a clean diskette and move original
                         sector from its saved position (see: Direct
                         Detection) to its proper location (sector 1,
                         head 0, track 0). On some systems, FAT copy 1
                         might be damaged, so an additional copying of
                         FAT 2 onto FAT 1 might be necessary.

Every time I see comments like these it bothers me since we have
obviously failed to properly inform people. It is NEVER necessary to
reformat or repartition a disk to defang a virus (sometimes it is
easier but that is another story). What is worse is seeing people wipe
all of their data and programs off of a disk and still (maybe) not
remove the virus.

Worse yet is to have one anti-virus program remove a virus (usually
sucessfully) only to have another claim the virus is still there as a
result of "ghosting" or a fragment that is harmless.

I know of one case where a product simply replaces the boot sector of
a floppy with all nulls - perfectly valid. But then another reports it
"suspect" since the boot record now does not follow the IBM/MicroSoft
specification.  Another where the anti-virus product studiously
avoided a "sensitive" area often used by disk controllers in the MBR
in cleaning up a disk only to have another flag the disconnected virus
fragment (ASCII at that) left there.

It just worries me that on March 6th, a lot of disks are going to be
"reformatted" by the Michelangelo. It bothers me more though that
between now and then a lot of disks will be formatted by their users
trying to get rid of infections both real and imagined.

Hokay,

We've seen a number of copies of Micelanagelo at Victoria University
of Wellington and I've received enough requests for information about
it from businesses and government departments in most of the main
centres in New Zealand to be pretty sure that it is here in
significant numbers, although I cannot give you an estimate of the
numbers naturally.

We are publicising and distributing Fredrik Skulason's F-Protect v202
as part of a disk of antivirus information and utilities we are giving
away to people who send us a _stamped_ SASE (times are hard these days
:-(). Basically, we are trying to reach the small business and private
users who don't have access to internet and other sources of accurate
and up-to-date virus information. Interestingly, its the larger
businesses and government departments which seem to be in the quickest
for assistance.

Of course we do emphasise that F-Prot is shareware and must be
registered for commercial use. Most people are very appreciative of
Frisk's efforts and claim to be registering. I hope enough of them
really do to keep him (and the others) active on our behalves.

BTW After making the story available to the media on Friday, we
received something like 400 disks by today (Tuesday). In a country the
size of ours, that is an incredible response. Maybe somebody out there
is really listening.

I'm looking for a UNIX program to scan for DOS viruses.  We've got a
RS/6000 (AIX box) operating as a file server for DOS machines.  We'd
like to run an AIX executable to scan for viruses because the AIX

Well, I'm an amiga owner who reads this group religiously!

Late last year my disk collection had a right royal Savaging from the
"SADDAM" virus which disguises itself as the Disk-Validator, and sets
about randomly altering all your vectors so that the disk becomes
read-error happy.  It Eventually trashes your disk at some given
trigger.

I've found that the best overall Amiga virus protection is given by
John Veldthuis' excellent VIRUS-CHECKER v5.40 available on
ab20.larc.nasa.gov by anonymous FTP.  Version 5.40 covers a plethora
of virii and has just been released in the last week or so.  John has
been updating it every month or two, and it therefore usually covers
the very latest virus reports. It utilises the Amiga's multitasking
environment to run continuously in the background checking newly
inserted disks and RAM every few seconds.  It also comes with a
special routine for reconstructing disks which have been vandalized by
the SADDAM virus -- this is why it's my favourite!

Another good antiviral program, but which is now (I think) a
commercial product, is Xavier leClerq's famous MASTER VIRUS KILLER,
also updated regularly.  MVK however operates as a stand alone
scanning/repair outfit, and will not "check-as-you-go".

death to virii!

Subject: re: "Polymorphic" viruses

Sorry folks for being slow in picking up this strand, some issues of
Virus-L have failed to arrive here.  (The problem appears to be at
this end, my access is via a VAXen cluster, but only one VAX has net a
single net node which gets VERY busy, <this is what I am told anyway>,
incoming (and outgoing) mail can't get through).

POLYMORPHIC is a term that I have been using about viruses for about a
year, however I use it in a different way.  Polymorphic means having
mulitple forms, so I have used the word to describe viruses which
infect different types of host or change their mode of operation.
Specifically I have applied the word to viruses which infect BOOT
sectors and program files (COM or EXE), or system files (eg .SYS).
These are clearly different forms and this behaviour requires a simple
concise description.  Regarding MS-DOS type systems I would even apply
the word to viruses which infect .COM & .EXE files in a different
manner, as COM and EXE files are so different in internal format.

For "Viruses using variable encryption with a variable decryption
routine" I would suggest the word "variable".  Polymorphic seems
inappropriate as the form is still the same: the same functions are
executed and there is no difference in observable behaviour - it is
not important to someone who is infected.  It is only the superficial
appearance that has changed, and even that is relatively minor;
loading the decryption key and executing the processing loop are
clearly visible with DEBUG and with some simple programming techniques
automatic recognition is straightforward.  The difference in the virus
is only important for those of us involved in the development of virus
search and identification software.

To realise that a single virus exists in a different form (BOOT
sector, COM, EXE or SYS) requires either analysing a disassembly or
observing the virus infecting in a suitably instrumented system.

I don't intend to dictate nomenclature to anyone nor is this intended
as a flame.  However I feel quite strongly that nomenclature should be
carefully considered, not least because if the sand changes under my
feet I shall have to change a lot of text sitting on my harddisk!

Summary: Reposted by Keith Petersen

I have uploaded to OAK.Oakland.Edu:

/pub/msdos/trojan-pro/
scanv86b.zip   Scans PC's for viruses.             Version 86B
vshld86b.zip   Infection Prevention TSR.           Version 86B
wscan86b.zip   Windows version of SCAN.            Version 86B

WHAT'S NEW

     Three new options have been added to this release of VIRUSCAN to allow
it to save and check information that can be used by CLEAN-UP to recover
infected files, partition tables, or boot sectors infected with unknown
viruses.  Using this option will add 52 bytes to COM and EXE files.
Also, an option has been added to prevent display of when SCAN is more
than seven months old.
     An option allow VSHIELD to be loaded off of network drives has been
added, plus the option to check to check for viruses any time an executable
file is accessed for any reason.  This includes ZIPing executable files,
moving files from one subdirectory to another, etcetera.
     We've done a virus audit and have started re-writting the VIRLIST.TXT
file, adding in viruses that were not listed or listed incorrectly and
updating information when necessary.  Unfortunately, we did not have
time to separately list the viruses that were added in this release.
The number of viruses now detected is 480 with 719 strains, for a total
of 1199.  This is compared with 373 viruses/977 strains in the last
(V85) release.
     Of particular interest in this release is the Pogue, which is a
polymorhphic virus.  This virus uses a new and difficult-to-detect self-
mutating engine employing a very sophisticated variable encryption technique
loosely based on one developed by the author of Dark Avenger virus and
contains code similar to that found in other Bulgarian viruses.  The virus was
uploaded anonymously to our BBSso it is not clear as to whether it is from
Eastern Europe or the USA.  It also unknown if it is widespread or not.

NOTE:  A last-minute bug fix has to be made to CLEAN-UP, and it will not
       be ready until Monday.

This message was sent by Yvo Desmedt for Antivirus Methods Congress.

ANTI-VIRUS EFFORT BY ALL CONSTITUENCIES

Your opinion is solicited concerning the Antivirus Methods Congress (AMC),
a US-based world organization uniting users, researchers and vendors in
the effort to retard and eventually minimize the onslaught of malicious code:
  -) share information among those affected,
  -) provide contact with successful efforts,
  -) promote and facilitate research.

Antivirus Methods Congress was formed in 1991.  Besides the usual
administrative officers that any professional group has (Lefkon,
Drusdow, Highland, Peterson), there are separate committee chairs to
serve as liaison - and stick up for the interests of - the various
constituencies that are affected: University members (Desmedt),
corporate users and researchers (Parker), government users (van Wyk),
telecom users (Fulford), non-DOS users, and vendors.

All of these positions are filled by direct election, not appointment.
Each one has one vote on the AMC Board of Directors.  You can run for
one if you would like to.  At spring elections, the runner-up for each
position becomes that committee Vice-Chair.  To run, send up to six
lines about yourself, naming the position and ending with the phrase
"X hours" and your telephone number.  The "X" is how many hours you
can reasonably be expected to spend per week on AMC related
activities.  If your "X" is "1" and everyone else is 1/2, you will
look like a hero and probably be elected.

This is a volunteer membership organization with the initial goal to
have more members than viruses (currently over 1000) by April.  It is
independent of any other entity and its goal will not be affected by
canceling a grant or a contract. There are now about 100 members.
Become a member by sending your name, "level" (see below), primary
constituency (see above), address, e-mail address and telephone to:
amc@well.sf.ca.us.

So far the functional standing committees include Research Methods
(Cohen), Legal Issues (Thackeray), Credentials (Brunnstein) and
Identification/Classification (Solomon).  The first task of
Classification is to identify and publicize one to three best schemes
so that researchers will try always to classify new viruses in an
accepted standard manner so that people elsewhere will not waste time
mistakenly "discovering" an old virus.

Credentials Committee will verify innermost "level" of members as
researcher, with successively broader levels of Vendor, User
Practitioner, and Lay User.  If your job involves more than installing
protective software on PC's, you are probably a User Practitioner.

Credentials Committee will supervise exchange of viruses among AMC
member researchers.  Safeguards on this process are being developed by
the Nonproliferation Committee (Skaulason), so that our swapped
viruses don't escape and if somebody brakes the rules they'll lose
their clearance.

Other than these four, Repository is one possible standing committee.

A business meeting will be held on March 12 in New York.  Ballots will
be mailed shortly afterward.  By naming yourself a member now, you can
vote without paying any dues.  The ballot will probably contain a
question of whether dues should be $5 or $10 per year.

AMC by-laws forbid from duplicating or displaying any journal, to
endorse any product or sponsor any course.  It is there to HELP SHARE
INFORMATION and help people get to the right hotline, center, interest
group or other resource.  It is a touchstone.  AMC is explicitly not
there to replace any existing vendor or user effort.  It will
harmonize with them (org tech term), and help researchers and others
with need-to-know but not in any clique, to get the information they
need or participate in an effort they can benefit.

If you intend to run, please state your company, university or agency
somewhere in six lines.  No company, etc., may have more than one vote
on the board of directors, because this is a large organization of
individuals, not a trade group.  If this rule causes a winning
candidate to resign, the Vice Chair of that committee becomes Chair.

You do not have to run or comment to join and receive the monthly thin
newsletter and join committees to receive e-mail.  Most people just
want to be kept up-to-date.  You will be.
