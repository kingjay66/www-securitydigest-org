There is a minor glitch: it depends on what the scanner does when it
detects the virus in memory. I have seen the following:

1) The scanner hangs the system, requesting a reboot. This is
inconvenient to the user and if s/he does not boot from a clean
floppy, the virus will still be in memory the next time. The result is
that people stop using such scanners.

2) The scanner outputs a warning, but either continues to scan the
files, or offers an option to do so. The first obviously leads to the
infection of all executables, and the latter is insecure, since an
unknowledgeable user is likely not to understand the warning
(especially if it is not worded correctly) and to select the
"Continue" option.

3) The scanner refuses to run and outputs an explanation for this.
This is the correct action, although it is an overkill if taken each
time a virus is found in memory. It must be taken only if a fast
infector is found. Currently all stealth viruses are fast infectors
(although it is not mandatory, strictly speaking), but not all fast
infectors are stealth. Therefore, this action of the scanner has
nothing to do with the stealth viruses in particular - it is related
to the fast infectors.

Only if it is a fast infector.

The current stealth technology does not try to conceal the virus code
in RAM. It is possible to do it, however, and some viruses (EDV, Fish
6, Whale, StarShip) are trying to do it. I cannot provide more details
for obvious reasons.

They are correct to throw it away - not because "scanner are
dangerous", but because "scanners alone do not provide a sufficient
level of protection". A multi-level defense must be used, with the
accent made on the integrity checking.

I disagree. First, I am not sure to understand your statement
correctly. I see two possible interpretations, both of which are not
true:

1) "The only way to achieve 100 % detection of a polymorphic virus is
through integrity management." Of course not, ANY -particular-
polymorphic virus can be detected by a scanner. The main problem is
that with LOTS of very polymorphic viruses appearing every now and
then this becomes very time- and effort-expensive.

2) "The only way to achieve 100 % detection of all possible viruses is
through integrity management." Unfortunately, this is not true. There
are several kinds of attacks against the integrity checking software.
Most of them can be stopped, it the developer of the software knows
about them. There is one, however, which I don't know how it can be
stopped reliably. It is represented by the slow viruses - viruses
which infect only executable objects that are being created or
modified. Examples: Darth Vader, Compiler, StarShip... Such viruses
make their first steps today, so they are relatively silly and poor
infectors. The idea represented in them can be improved, though, and
they can be made quite dangerous...

> Meanwhile, the scanners are recognizing this. Frisk's heuristic analysis and

Frisk's heuristic analyzer has nothing to do with integrity management
- - it is just a scanner which scans for particular (not virus-specific)
pieces of code. McAfee's implementation of /AF is insecure and can be
bypassed by any attack against an integrity checking program I can
think of.

> systems first determine that *something* has happened before trying to
> determine *what*.

The main problem to the user is that the integrity checking programs
report that something has -already- happened. That is: the virus
(maybe?) has already infected your machine and is spreading. Most
people want to be warned -before- this happens. That's why so many
people continue to use scanners, which do not provide appropriate
protection, I agree with you here.

> The power of such a product is that when an attack occurs, it can notify the
> user.

The other main problem of the integrity checking software: it reports
that -something- has happened. The decision whether it is a virus or
not is generally left to the user, who is known to be unable to make
such decisions... :-)

> A scanner is then brought out to find out *what* has happened. Once

Ah, but if it is a known virus, a scanner alone would have detected
and prevented it. And if it isn't, a scanner won't help either...

Not true. A general attack is still possible (even several of them).
See the mention of the slow viruses above.

Remember: there ain't no such thing as 100% computer virus
prevention.

It isn't. Generally, the user is unable to decide whether the alert
has been caused by a virus or not.

Less than a year ago I also thought that an integrity checker, if
implemented in a secure way (like Untouchable) is able to detect all
possible viruses. Today I do not think so any more... The only thing
it is able to do is to reduce the virus threat to a manageable and not
very dangerous level. But even if we achieve this for all of our
computers, it will be a great success. I fully agree with you that a
multi-level line of defense is needed and that the accent must be made
on the integrity management products.

This is something that Ross Greenburg and I discussed on V-L about two
years ago and bears a touch of repetition: consider a three by three
matrix with ADD, SUB, and XOR on the top and ROL, ROR, and NOP to the
side. This creates a fast (two instruction) mechanism for generating
a sixteen bit checksum. By utilizing a random seed for the calculation
on each machine this would make a "blind guess" of the algorithm difficult
even if all nine values for particular programs are known.

A significant increase in strength is added if two differing checksums are
simultaneously created (e.g. McAfee's Validate). At this point a directed
attack becomes easier than a blind attack (as used by nearly all viruses).

While a good Scanner can easily handle such weak encryption mechanisms (as
demonstrated by their ability to detect most mTe infections), the
number of modules required to do this are neither trivial nor small. It
is doubtful that a 100k virus would spread very far (I did see a 250k trojan
written in Clipper once so could be rong).

The point is that beyond a certain point, a directed attack (disable the
anti-virus TSR in memory) becomes easier than a general (infect any file)
one and the sheer number and diversity of anti-viral programs makes this
difficult.

A RISK is that companies/organizations are now starting to standardise on
certain products so that a professional (?) directed attack on a specific
group of systems all using the same product is quite feasible (why my BIOS
anti-virus programs include means to verify their presence from the O/S
level).

Virtually all anti-virus programs today are "good enough" for the average user
and will detect most viruses that are "in the wild": the differences are
really minor for such primitive attacks.

Some companies (but not many so far) have realized the need for self-
validation to prevent directed attacks and hve run into the anchient
question of  "who watches the watchers ?".

This brings us back to a real problem of testing anti-viral programs and what
needs to be tested for. We now have more viruses than we ever wanted
(see Vesselin's disk space problem) or needed but little testing is done
for the secondary (directed) attacks. For those programs that perform a self-
check, how strong is it ? Does the program checksum the signature strings
as well as the executables ? Individually or Collectively ? (Consider the
effect of a virus that recognizes certain Scanners and "fixes" the signature
strings so it is not found - not trivial but possible - will the Scanner
detect the change ?) Who can tell ?

And with that comforting thought...

Subject: Vshield 91 locks up windows 3.1 (PC)

I am experiencing a lockup of windows 3.1 when version 91 of McAfee
VSHIELD is installed on my 386. VSHIELD is being installed in
autoexec.bat with /windows option.

The lockup occurs when attempting to return to windows after running
any non-windows application from windows using the _default.pif or a
unique .pif for the application. The monitor gets wavey lines as if it
cannot synchronize.  A Cntl-alt-del brings up a window indicating no
application is running, and a second cntl-del reboots the system.

The lockup condition does not occur if I do not load VSHIELD during
startup, or if I replace version 91 with version 89.

My configuration is

   386 SX
   4 Meg memory
   Norton Destop V1.0 running as windows program manager
   win3.1 running in enhanced mode.

Has anybody else seen this problem, or have any suggestions?

I have seen recommendations that SCANV *not* be run from the hard
drive because a virus can trick the scan program, and then infect it,
and other programs on the drive. Does this same restriction apply to
WSCAN? The installation program by default installs WSCAN on the hard
drive.

Secondly, can a virus infect the windows .ini files? how can a user
protect against it, since they are normally written by WINDOWS during
normal operation?

While I agree that integrity management is a good thing, I think this
statement is much too strong.  The appearance of the MtE did not
suddenly give us thousands more viruses to detect, any more than the
first self-garbling ("encrypting") virus did.  Nor did the "Virus
Construction Set" suddenly give us billions of new viruses to detect
(even though, since it lets the user insert a custom message into the
viruses it generates, there are in some sense billions of different
possible VCS-generated viruses).  It is by no means impossible to
write a scanner that detects all possible MtE heads; depending on what
you mean by "pure", the MtE is no more of a limitation of pure
scanners than is any previous polymorphic virus.  So it is simply not
the case that the only way to do 100% MtE detection is by using
integrity management.

In fact, the MtE actually did people using scanners a -favor- to some
extent: once you've gotten an updated version of your scanner that
detects MtE heads, any new virus writer who decides to use the MtE to
garble a new virus will end up with a virus that your scanner
*already* detects.  We should encourage new virus writers to use the
MtE; it'll save the anti-virus world the trouble of updating their
scanners again!  *8) In the long run, of course, the MtE is a bad
thing, because it represents another tool to make the antisocial more
efficient at their vandalism.  But it's not because it wildly
increases the number of viruses in any real sense.

In practice, I've found that integrity managment software at current
tech levels is mostly useable only by people (like Padgett!) who know
quite a bit about their machines.  I have yet to see a package that
would really get along with a non-hacker user; typical users simply
don't know whether or not "the file SYSEMM3.EXE has changed" is
something to worry about.  I would love for this not to be true, and I
anticipate that we will eventually have smarter systems that help the
user decide between OK changes and suspicious ones, but I don't think
we're there yet for the average person.  If anyone can tell a story
about a large group of non-hacker users (e.g. a large non-computer
business site) that's using integrity management software and liking
it, I'd be very interested in hearing!  I imagine the rest of the list
would as well...

My roommate accidently garbled his CMOS while debugging a C program he

Subject: mutating - polymorphic (PC)

Hi,

Someone (I don't find it again) in the last 2 digests wrote about
scanners. And if my memory serves right, he used to refer to the
DAME-viruses as polymorphic ones. But:

I always thought, that after a discussion about 30 digests ago, the
difference between a mutating and a polymorphic virus is cleared and
defined. So if I read correct, the DAME is an encryptor. So these
viruses (dedicated et al.) are not necessarily polymorphic. A
polymorphic virus should be a virus using different code, to do the
same thing. So my conclusion: A polymorphic virus can be a mutating
one, too, by using the DAME.

This is one thing. Now a new one, where I know, that I will be flamed,
but I'll survive:

How about dropping scanstrings of old viruses, which are not likely to
reappear again? Just like in medicine: if the is an illness which
disappeared, why waste more serum than necessesary?

Thanks, Alfred

I recognize no "1530" virus, but there is one variant of the Dark
Avenger which is 1530 bytes long - and known as "CB 1530".  I assume
this is the same program.

F-PROT has been able to detect and remove this virus for a long time,
but I have never bothered to analyse it in detail, as I was not aware
it was out in the wild, so I cannot give you any information on the

I would have called it a trojan horse.  I was the proud recipient of at
least 3 copies of that thing when it was rampant.  I had the sense to
look at it and not run it when it first came in.

Well, sitting around after we had CHRISTMA pretty much beaten, I and
some others quickly thought of many ways to 'improve' it.  This was all
speculation.  But, it wouldn't be hard to make it destructive.
   I was somewhat surprised that CHRISTMA never surfaced again.
The scenario I had imagined was one where a person had gone on
vacation or sabatical and left a GONE exec running to receive stuff
while he was away.  The following year around Christmas he would find
the exec on his disk and run it . . . and away we go.  As far as I know
that didn't happen.  I wonder why?

Most viruses use a word XOR.

True, but the scan string must be "updated" on-line by XORing it with
the key used in the particular file. This is usually not much easier
than to decrypt the whole virus body (usually small - 2-3 Kb).

But most scanners don't bother to do that. They don't try to identify
the virus exactly; they only try to identify that there is a virus.
That's why they just use the decryptor routine as a scan signature.

This is not a problem, since the scanners are virus-specific by
definition.

> Is it viable?

It's realizable, but I doubt that it's worth the effort.

Hello Everyone!

	Two items:

1) VSIG9206.ZIP is now available on eugene in the directory
pub/virus-software/pc. This files replaces ASIG9206.ZIP and
VSUM9205.ZIP.

2) I have received numerous inquiries about the domain name change on
eugene. Please note that the IP address has not changed. It is still
129.109.9.21. The only change is in the name.

If you have any questions, send mail to perry@eugene.utmb.edu. Thanks!
