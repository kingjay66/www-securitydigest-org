VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  (The complete set of posting guidelines is available by
FTP on cert.sei.cmu.edu or upon request.)  Please sign submissions
with your real name.  Send contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU
(that's equivalent to VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).
Information on accessing anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue
archives is distributed periodically on the list.  Administrative mail
(comments, suggestions, and so forth) should be sent to me at:

	We at Microcom want to make sure we know what virus this
"STONED3" is, exactly.  Novell will not provide us with a sample,
but we are pretty sure this is the virus we originally called
"LastDirSect" and then later (when we found out what others were
calling it) renamed to "NOINT".  Anybody have a sample of the virus
Novell is reported to have inadvertantly distributed ?  If so, could
you run our VIRx v1.9 against it, to check our theory ?

	We would sure appreciate it.

Alan Fedeli writes in VIRUS-L 5/002:
- ->We also know Stoned-3 as NOINT.  NOINT may be a useful addition to further
- ->correspondence on this advisory.

And even more input on this:
The virus was named "NoInt" by Micke McCune when he isolated it in
MAY91 as the virus dosen't use interrupts to send commands to BIOS.
McAffe calls it "Stoned III" for some reason or another and Norton
AntiVirus calls it "Bloomington" - the city of it's discovery.

Yes indeed!  If you can handle physical sector editors like Norton
Utilities or PCTools you can do it your self by copying Head 0 Track 0
Sector 7 to Head 0 Track 0 Sector 1.  This will copy the original
Master Boot Sector back where it belongs and radicate the virus in the
process.

But, remember to boot the PC off a clean floppy disk before you start.

Hope this helps.

	Another  quick Stoned 3 question.  At the University of Colorado
(Denver) we got hit hard by the inadvertant mass release of the FORM virus
last year.  I found myself spearheading the process of cleaning up and 
hardening the defenses of one of our computer labs.  I would like to be
ahead of the game if the Stoned 3 release hits us.
	We have been relying on Simon McAuliffe's NoStone as an ongoing
defense against Stoned, however I notice that the Stoned 3 variant is
listed a stealthed variety.  Does anyone know if NoStone v4.1 (released
June 1990) will do any good?
	By the way, thanks for all the help.  What reputation I have as a
virucidal maniac is due mostly to what I have gleaned from this news group.

Subject: Norton's AV (PC)

      Question for anyone:

      We have been using the latest (I think) version of NAV at
   the center I work in.  We scan disks when people enter, and also
   run a scan of the machines a couple of nights a week just to be
   on the safe side.  (ok, maybe the paranoid side ... :^)

      We have had a re-occurring problem with NAV crashing after
   scanning a single 5.25 disk.  It's not terrible when a person is
   only intending to use 1 5.25, but people who come in with 5 or 6
   disks means that you either have to enter NAV, scan one, exit,
   start NAV again ...  OR enter NAV, scan one, attempt again (with
   a high chance of crashing and needing a re-boot).  Sometimes (?!)
   the disk goes through w/out a hitch and we are able to scan more
   than one 5.25 at a time.  It's not happened (to my knowledge) on
   3.5 scans, and it's not a memory-resident conflict - the machine
   can have the same problem on the second run, other machines have
   this problem with different memory loads, etc.

      Someone was in the other day and mentioned that Norton had
   had a problem with that version and that a letter had been sent
   to people, but we haven't seen anything along those lines ...

      Anyone know about this?

	Our facility has been infected by virus 1575/1591 virus.  The
virus had infected an entire building.  I am not sure how long the
virus had been traveling around and I suspect that I will see this
virus again.  However, none of the infected machines showed any signs
of being infected except for one.  This machine was obviously the most
used and the most infected.

	A green catepiller with a yellow head crawled across the
screen and munched the letters then shifted the margins to the right.
I was able to clean-up the disks using McAfee's CLEAN (ver. 85)
without any damage to the files (except it destroyed versions of SCAN
and CLEAN that were on the hard drive).

QUESTION:  Does anyone have any information on this virus?  I am interested
	   in finding more about this virus since the odds are I will see
	   this little green fellow again.  Thanks!

No antivirus program has i detected, except from those watching files'

During 3 days it has infected all files but COMMAND.COM, some of them
worked normally, several terminated just after calling them.
It is possible that it writes in FAT1 - into last sectors.
The same string was in: CLEAN85.ZIP, there in CLEAN.EXE and VALIDATE.COM,

If you have the same "Michelangelo" virus that I've analyzed, it will
overwrite the bottom of the boot disk (the first floppy or the first
hard disk) with trash if booted on March 6th.  You probably want to
make sure you've cleaned it up well before then!

As usual, your mileage may vary: the virus you have may have little or
nothing in common with the virus I've examined.  Have a local guru
disassemble it if you want to be sure; it's quite small!

Forwarded to VIRUS-L by Keith Peterson <w8sdz@rigel.acs.oakland.edu>

We were configuring the ethernet card on our new 486 UNIX (SVR5) box
when we determined that we needed to boot and run DOS to run the
ethernet configuration program.  (Or possibly the EISA configuration --
this happened in my office but I was not involved).

No problem: simply create a boot disk from the DOS system across the
hall and reboot DOS.

Unfortunately, that system had been infected with the 'Stoned' virus.
This virus overwrote the UNIX BOOT TRACK when the infected DOS was
booted.

Result -- no more SVR5.  We will probably have to perform a low-level
format of the disk and rebuild the UNIX from original media.

Morals: 1) don't ignore DOS viruses simply because you run UNIX unless
you NEVER need to use DOS.  2) Pound on DOS users to note and report
strange behavior because some infections are very costly (several
person-days to rebuild this system -- at least it was new and had no
work-in-progress on it!)

CNN is reporting that a computer "virus" was used during the Gulf War.
Reportedly, the virus was used to blank the screens of Iraq's air
defense computers.  The alleged virus was supposed to have been hidden
in a printer chip that was smuggled in from Jordan.  I (and many
others, I'm sure) would be very interested if anyone has further

Subject: Viruses against Iraq??????

	I was watching CNN (Sun Jan 12 00:04:57 EST 1992), and they
were talking about things that helped the US defeat Iraq. One of the
things they mentioned was a "virus" on a chip which the CIA planted in
some printers in Jordan bound for Iraq. Apparently, it blanked out
computer screens attached to the printers, and those screens were part
of the air defense network over Baghdad.

	Virus on a chip?? How and when did it go off? What type virus?
(it probably wasn't a real virus (not self replicating) but nasty
screen killing code on a chip) So now hacking is now legal, but only
during wartime against an enemy. (goes with killing)

What's the deal here? Am I the last to hear this? (has it been discussed?)

[Moderator's note: Please be sure to read this and the other myth
postings as the MYTHS that they are.]

DEFMTH6.CVP   920105

                    The Modem Virus of 1989

Continuing with Padgett's list:

5) "Modem" virus
The first report I got of the modem virus is from VIRUS-L Volume
1, number 42 in early December, 1988.  It came from the JPL, of
all places.  The original report was supposed to have come from
a telecommunications firm in Seattle, and contained all kinds of
technical bafflegab, including the fact that the virus was
transmitted via the "sub-carrier" on 2400 bps modems, so you
should only use 300 or 1200.  The "subcarrier" was supposed to
be some secret frequency that the modem manufacturers used for
debugging.  The virus was supposed to do all kinds of changing
of the internal registers of the modem.  That first report gave
no indication of how the virus got from the modem into the
computer.

As people started to raise objections to the possibility of this
ridiculous scenario, the initial report was traced back to a
posting on Fidonet (the earliest date I have in my records is
October 6, 1988) by someone who gave his name as "Mike
RoChenle".  Ken later suggested this might be read as
"microchannel", the then new bus for IBM's PS/2 machines.

Among the serious researchers, these rumours were dealt with
rather quickly, within about two weeks.  We continued, however,
to receive reports of the virus for most of 1989.  The facts;
that modem manufacturers use all the bandwidth available for
transmission, that the internal registers are data rather than
programs, that "unused" pins in an RS-232 cable are still
"assigned" and can't be used for spurious transmissions, and
that terminal emulation programs do not "call" incoming data as
programs; only served to spur the reporters to greater flights
of fancy in their descriptions of the "modem virus".

With the phenomenon being flat out physically impossible, why
did the rumour persist for such a long time?

One reason is that the rumour itself may have prompted a lot of
interest in computer viral programs from among computer and
modem users.  As these people joined virus discussion groups,
and not seen the modem virus being discussed, they continued to
post reports of it.  Also, the rumours contained enough "pseudo-
technical" language as to seem credible, while remaining
essentially incomprehensible to those who, while suing a modem,
know little of the technology involved.  One of the major
reasons, however, is likely that people were primed to believe
it.  BBSes, and, by extension, modems, have had a consistently,
and unfairly, bad press over the past few years.  BBSes are seen
as the ultimate source of all "evil" programs; viri and trojans;
and anything bad said about them is to be believed.

Which is another myth.
