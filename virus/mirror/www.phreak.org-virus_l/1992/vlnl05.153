No, F-Prot does not come in an archive with -AV codes. The -AV codes
are essentially useless to protect from tampering. DON'T RELY ON THEM!
There is a short (under 50 lines) C program that can fake any -AV code
used by PKZip. For instance, here is a short archive, which looks like
if it is packaged by McAfee Associates, but of course it isn't:

Well, that's normal. All those are text files and therefore really
don't contain valid 80x86 CPU instructions... :-) Please, be sure to
perfectly understand the limitations of the heuristic scanners, before
using one...

Doesn't matter. The slack space in the last cluster (after the end of
the files) is not used by DOS and does not receive control. At least
three viruses (Number_of_the_Beast, Int13, and Necropilis) make use of
it, but they store there the overwritten -origianal- part of the file,
not th virus body. If you are still worried, you could wipe out the
slack space, by using e.g. WipeInfo from the Norton Utilities package.

Don't worry, this is just some garbage left in the slack space.

First, you must prove that you really have a virus. Try creating
several large files, containing only NOPs and try to infect them.

Ah...I had forgotten about that one.  However, I am not sure if it
matters, as that "Indonesian Freddy" never materialized - that is, no
virus researcher seems to have a copy of it.  Maybe it existed, maybe
it did not, but for now, I'll consider it to belong to the "rumored"
category.

Well, the explanation is quite simple. All text messages F-PROT uses
are stored on disk, and only read into memory when necessary.  So, if
you run F-PROT from a diskette, and then remove/replace that diskette,
you will get unpredictable behaviour.

I am sorry, but there is simply no way this can be fixed. If you only
have a one-disk machine, you can usually bypass the problem by
creating a RAMDISK and move the program there.

This is just a friendly little warning to all in echoland.  Seems as
if some generous "programmer" has taken upon himself to construct a
virus and attach it to a hacked game.  The game is called "CASTLE
WOLFENSTEIN" , the virus is in a file called "wolfchet.exe" its
basically a cheat program that allows you to have unlimited lives and
unlimited ammunition in the game.  However, it also infects your boot
track of your hard disk.  McCaffee v.91b identified this virus as the
"Wolf" virus, however others have mentioned it may be a variant of the
"Whale" virus.  I aquired this game from a local BBS and like any good
pc owner should, was scanning my recent downloads and POOF there it
was.  It hadn't become active yet so I didn't loose anything.
However, I did realize one thing, this program sat on my hard disk for
9 days before I found it.  Why you might ask?  Well it seems that I
didn't realize that many virus scanners cannot/don't look into zipped
files.  I had kept the file zipped for awhile before I unzipped it.
In fact, I almost ran the cheat program when it hit me that I hadn't
scanned in a day or so and it might be a good time to do it....(I must
have a gaurdian angel).
 
Just thought I would let you know...by the way...the virus made its
way to South Florida by way of a British sailor.  As many people know,
the Port of Tampa is a stop off point for many British warships.  One
of these warships had a sailor on it who with the use of his Laptop
computer brought over software from Europe and

posted it on Florida BBS's.  I'm not accusing the sailor that he knew
what was going on, however, it does seem that alot of viruses seem to
orginate in places other than the USA.
 
Let me know VIA EMAIL if anyone else has had experience with this
virus as I don't post here often...(its long distance to my mail hub).

Hm...right - this was a side-effect of a small last-minute change I

(shrug) well, the original idea was that one would normally only use
"Install" from a write-protected floppy disk, where USER.DEF could not
be created, so I did not bother to copy this file, but maybe I should.

I don't think this is on these days.  If an application needs write
permission for users in an area where the executables are stored then
I will not allow it on a LAN I administer.  However, enough of me :-)
My experience of the Jerusalem Virus on netware 3.11 is that an
infected station cannot infect a file on the server because of the use
of INT 21h by the netware shell and the virus itself.  Workstations
just bomb out if an infected program is run from the workstations hard
disk before any infection can take place. I am assuming that the above
LAN was not netware or have I have just been lucky?

Thanks in advance for any info on this.

Subject: Problem w' booting C: then A: (PC)

Someone recently noted that there is a trend in BIOS for boot from C:
then A:. We have machines in use like this and have found a problem.
Systems that have a SCSI controller will boot from A: even though the
BIOS setup is set for C: then A:. I have been able to get it to work
once but when reseting to A: then C: and back again it wouldn't work.
SCSI controllers have built in BIOS so CMOS is set to no hard drives
installed. It is possible that the BIOS is timing out before the SCSI
controller generates a ready signal. This would result in BIOS
thinking there was no hard drive. I will be trying additional test to
see if there is a way to get the C: then A: option to work. If you
have any information that might help solve this please let me know. In
the mean time you may have a hole in your virus defense system.

Hello Mr. Seymour,

The "blem wit" is a message from inside your NETX file, if memory
serves.  Older versions of NETX substitute part of the "...proBLEM

Subject: Virus Analysis of BootExe Virus (PC)

                                Boot Exe Virus
                        
                    A multipartite virus with a difference.
 
The BootExe (temporary name) virus is an extremely efficient infector.
It infects fixed disks, floppy diskettes, and certain EXE files.  It's
most unusual characteristic is that it infects during execution of the
BIOS interrupt 13 (disk functions) rather than intercepting the DOS
int 21 (file functions).  By doing this it can avoid many monitor-type
anti-virus interceptors.
 
* BOOT RECORD EXECUTION
 
When executed as a boot record, it acts as a conventional boot record
virus.  It reserves 4K of memory at the top of conventional memory,
copies itself into this area, and intercepts int 13, redirecting it to
it's own handler.  The virus then checks for the presence of a hard
disk and infects the partition table if one is found.
 
Finally, the virus loads the original boot record and passes control 
to it.
 
* EXE FILE EXECUTION
 
As explained later, infected EXE files are executed by DOS as a COM 
file.
 
The virus first relocates itself into the top of the allocated 
program memory.  It then performs an "Am I Here" call.  If it 
returns false (virus not present), it infects memory, and revectors
int 13 to itself.
 
Finally, the virus adjusts all relocatable references in the EXE 
file, sets the stack, and jumps to the original EXE entry point.  
These actions are normally performed by DOS when the EXE file is 
loaded.  Now it is a COM file, the virus needs to perform them.
 
* INTERRUPT 13 HANDLING
 
The int 13 functions 0F and 02 are intercepted.  All other functions 
are ignored.
 
    -Int 13 fn 0Fh
 
The 0F function is to write a test buffer.  Normally this function 
is rarely used, and it may only be applicable to an XT BIOS.
 
The virus uses this function as an "Am I Here" call.  Presumably 
this allows the function call to be recognized as a legitimate 
function (in case anyone is watching).  If the virus is already 
resident it returns 19 in AH.
 
    -Int 13 fn 02h
 
Function 2 is to read between 0 and 17 disk sectors (depending on 
the drive).  The virus takes the following action before allowing 
the function to proceed.
 
It reads the first of the target sectors to an internal buffer.  It 
then tests the buffer to see if it is the header of an EXE file 
suitable for infection.  If any of the following tests fail, it 
proceeds to the next stage.
 
- - The sector must begin with the EXE file header of "MZ".
- - The file size (according to the EXE header) must be less than 64K 
  (so it will run as a COM file).
- - The table of relocatable items must be 512 bytes in length and 
  must contain at least 453 bytes of unused space.
- - The program must request all available memory when it is run (most 
  EXE programs do).
 
When all these conditions are met, the virus inserts itself into the 
unused area of the relocatable table, converts the "MZ" to a short 
jump to itself and rewrites the sector to disk.  This in effect 
converts the file to COM format.  Unfortunately DOS will execute it 
as a COM, despite it having an EXE header, without warning.
 
The next stage is to test if the disk request is for a diskette.  If 
it is, and it is a read of the first cylinder, the virus checks to 
see if the diskette is already infected.  If not, it inserts itself 
in the boot record of the diskette.
 
* TRIGGERS
 
The virus does not appear to contain any triggers.
 
* DESTRUCTIVE ACTIONS
 
The virus does not appear to contain any deliberately destructive 
code other than to infect disks and EXE files.
 
* DETECTION
 
Infected boot records and EXE files will contain the following byte 
sequence:
 
BB 92 01 EB 21 10? A1 13 04 48 48 83 2E 13 04 04 04? BB 7A 01 8E C0 FC

It's on Compuserve.  As far as when it will get out, don't hold your

Jimmy has stated that Compuserve is the best the company can do right
now.  It will *not* be posted to BBSes "around the world".  If anyone

Subject: Maltese Amoeba virus (PC)

Does anyone know anything about the Maltese Amoeba virus? I've
been out of it for a bit, and just got a memo from a software
company (John Wiley & Sons) informing me that some of their disks
were infected.

The letter only suggests that the virus "may, unfortunately,
affect files on your hard drive" and that it is only detectable
by the Norton Anti-Virus (Version 2.0).

Being from a department (MSU Dept. of Statistics) that does not
have acces to NAV, I'd really like to know if anyone has more
information.....

Thanks,
Jerry Reno (reno@cps.msu.edu)

Subject: Which detect/protect s/w? (PC)

     Could someone E-mail or post what combinations of virus
detection/protection programs are generally recommended?  I have
McAfee's SCAN and CLEAN (BTW, what IS the latest version # out
there?), but are these two sufficient for detection?

     What do most people recommend for hard disk protection?  F-Prot?
Sentry?  Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks.

Subject: Information on CPAV vs McAfee (PC)

Just like to find out if any of you has done any comparisons between
CPAV (Central Point Anti-Virus) and McAfee. In particular features
that are unique to either of these products. I would appreciate if you
could e-mail me any relevant information on these 2 products.

Thanks in advance.

Cheers

He did = I got it and it turned out to be a new virus, which I propose
to call Alexander.  It bears some resemblance to the Dark Avenger
series, but I have not yet been able to determine how closely they are
related.  There is an indication that the virus is of East-European
origin (written in Romania).

Anyhow, I have updated F-PROT to find and disinfect it - look for
version 2.05a (to be released on Monday).

False alarm - sorry folks.  I did some (ehem) improvements in 2.05
regarding handling of the few viruses that actually spread in
compressed form, such as Stanco, Happy Monday and Even Beeper.
Unfortunately this caused some false alarms, so I changed back to my
old, (but slower) method in 2.05a.

I will upload 2.05a right after this weekend - I just want to include
as many as possible of the 100+ new viruses that I just got - most of
which were from Russia.

But what the report probably did not say was that the virus scanner
included in the package deal was F-PROT. :-)

Sorry this is so late, I thought some other Amiga users would have
answered this.

The Virus Test Centre in Hamburg produces some material, which may not
be comprehensive.  It is available by anonymous ftp, and I think Ken
has copies at cert.org for US access.
    system:     ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de
    directory:  /pub/virus/texts/catalog
    files:      bytes   date       name
                44234 Feb 10  1992 amiga.zip
                16325 Jul 25 10:01 AmigaVir.792
    user name:  anonymous
    password:   [your e-mail address]

As this site only has a low volume modem link it is best to use a net
copy program to fetch the file.  (I have used the following copy
programs, VAX/VMS: 'transfer', SUN Unix: 'hhcp').  Note the '.zip'
file is binary and must be copied in binary mode, and may need to be
decompressed with PKZIP on a MS-DOS system.

The documentation for the better Amiga anti-virus software includes
short descriptions of viruses.  For ftp access try, (from Jim Wright's
helpful postings), one of:
    system:     ms.uky.edu                  (IP address is 128.163.128.6)
    directory:  /pub/amiga/Antivirus

    system:     eugene.utmb.edu             (IP address is 129.109.1.21)
    directory:  /pub/virus-software/amiga

  backup site to eugene
    system:     beach.utmb.edu              (IP address 129.109.1.207)
    directory:  [ANONYMOUS.PUB.VIRUS.AMIGA]

I'm wondering if there is such a thing as a virus detection program
available for the Apple IIgs computer.  If it does exist please let me
know where I can get the program, and if there is any cost associated.

Thank you,

Well, your suppositions are right. It is unable to provide protection
against some advanced stealth mechanisms, but it is able to catch all
simple viruses and even some of the stealth ones. Some protection is
better than no protection, just don't rely on it.

BTW, have in mind that programs which perform self-checking cannot be
disinfected from some of the existing viruses. The reason is that a
lot of viruses are padding the EXE files so that their length becomes
a multiple of 16 (completely unnecessary, but Jerusalem did it and
lots of virus authors copied it from there). Most of these viruses
don't keep a record of the actual file length, so this information is
lost. Therefore, all disinfectors will leave up to 16 bytes of
garbage, after disinfecting the file. Of course, the checksum of the
file will not match any more, so a self-checking program will refuse
to work. Yet another argument not to use disinfection but to replace
the infected file with a clean copy.

Vesselin
