Just a bit of clarification here. I do not have the referenced product however
have experienced some of the incompatabilities alluded to above:

1) Zenith - early PC and XT (models 151, 158, & 159) with the Zenith clock/
   calendar add-on had a habit of writing to the DOS Boot Record (DBR) if
   not told to quit. I have not seen it exhibited on AT (248) or later
   equipment. Early HP Vectras are said to exhibit the same behavious though
   I have not seen this.

2) Tandon - uses a custom BIOS that actually checks the BIOS for a valid
   partition table (bravo !), permits boot selection (as do Zeniths and NECs)
   & will halt the boot if not found. Some earlier Tandons with large disks
   used a sector size of 1024 bytes instead of 512 bytes. Both have been
   known to cause problems with non-compliant access control and anti-viral
   programs.

One final comment on the Zeniths - Several people have noted the boot device
selectability while others have said it does not work. My experience is as
follows - it works but if a hard disk is not found, the BIOS will fall back
to the first floppy drive. This check appears to be made before any BIOS
extensions are loaded thus if the Zenith BIOS is set to "none" as when a
hardcard or non-Zenith-standard controller is used, the BIOS will revert
to boot from floppy drive A no matter what the setting.

Incidently, for several reasons I consider the Zenith one of the best
software development/testing machines made and if more companies used them
for Alpha testing, there would be much less buggy code released. In the
best American (Anglo-French ? - well, I like Facel-Vegas too) tradition,
they always seem to be able to do more than you expected. Will admit
they do seem to appreciate a gentle touch.

					Warmly,

Subject: Re: Viruscan (PC)

SCAN 89 (havent tried 95 yet) found no viruses; however, at my
university during lab, using quickbasic, I was tidying up a small
program.. fixing output and such and all the sudden, I kid you not,
the computer started typing by itself, all over the place.. and
sometimes it would block text and somehow hit the controls to start
compiling.. I was hoping that it would not find the keys to either
save or delete text it block. SO I frantically shell to DOS (it would
not let me for a bit) and at DOS it STILL typed by itself. I got a
student and my professor to verify it.  We were clueless. We ran scan
89 (what was in the lab) and found nothing.  Fortunatelly it did not
overwrite what I had.

Any viruses/new ones known for such a thing? It was really disturbing,
for about 10 minutes before the incident started, I had left for a few
minutes to get some lunch. If it had started throwing up on the screen
while I was gone, I probably would have returned to a screen with
Wordperfect or Norton WIPEDISK or something.

It also showed a FEW extended characters, but mostly tabs, alpha-numers,
and somehow Function keys and alternate/ctrl characters.

And help in this matter would be appreciated.

samsung!ulowell!cps.msu.edu!reno@uunet.UU.NET (Gerald L Jr Reno) asks
about the Maltese Ameoba virus, and Vess gives a good summary of what
it does.  A tiny bit more non-technical information: it's also known
as the "Grain of Sand" virus (by us at IBM) and the "Irish" virus (by
McAfee Assoc and perhaps others).  It's been in IBM's virus scanner
since last November or so (version 2.1.6 and after).  There was a
small wave of reports around the turn of the year, but I don't think
we've seen any lately.  DC

(Other folks have already answered the other questions very nicely).
Yes!  In fact, the two viruses are called StarDot-789 and StarDot-801.
They differ in that the latter has 12 extra NOPs in it (and other
addresses are adjusted accordingly).  Otherwise they are identical.
Don't know why any anti-virus tool would repair them incorrectly; they
are easy to verify and remove (any "disinfector" that doesn't verify
that it's dealing with the usual virus before removing, or otherwise
make sure that the result is the same as before infection, should of
course be chucked into the sea at once, or at least not used to
disinfect important files).  Perhaps just a bug that they can fix.

No!  We know of no 2885 false positives at all, so if you've gotten
reports in multiple files, it's almost certainly a real infection.
(If you'd like to uuencode and send me an infected file, I'd be glad
to verify the exact identity.)

I think F-Prot calls it "Yankee (TP-44)".  Not too atrociously
different!  *8) It's not a fascinating virus; it infects COM and EXE
files, and sometimes plays the tune Yankee Doodle at 5pm.  It also
alters the Bouncing Ball virus, if it finds in in memory, but that
basically never happens so isn't interesting (the alteration causes
the altered BB to eventually stop spreading, as I recall).

Subject: "Eagle has landed" = virus??? (PC)

I have a user how swears her computer sometimes comes up with the
following message flashed briefly on the screen:

    "The eagle has landed"

and that it usually won't boot.  I must say I panicked, dug out our
crusty tools and couldn't find anything.  I can't find any reference
in the lists to this phrase, but I have this annoying feeling that
I've read of it once in this context.

When our user support guy goes and checks the machine it checks ok
(Central Point AV) and all *he* sees is "Eagle II VGA Bios" on the
screen for an instant.  The user is adamant that she is correct...

Does anyone recognize the first phrase ("The eagle has landed") as
meaning anything?

Thanks for any help.  We aren't allowed to shoot users here.

Thanks for the interesting writeup!  One thing to note: although it
may mistake OS/2 executables for Windows executables and therefore
insert itself into them, if it uses DOS INT21 services to do its
infection it will *not* be able to infect under OS/2 (because of
course you don't get services from OS/2 by doing INTs).  So while it
may accidentally mess up OS/2 files, it cannot actually operate and
spread under OS/2 unless it is considerable more complex than this
writeup suggests.

(Just want to squelch any "OS/2 VIRUS!" rumors before they start...)

Subject: Stoned on non-dos partition (PC)

The machine at work is currently running on non-standard PC-MOS
version 6.1 to 6.2.

This is bad.

A stoned virus has somehow attatched itself to the hard disk and copies
itself to all the floppies inserted in all the floppy drives.

I would appreciate anyone getting back to me about how Stoned works,
or where it may rest on the hard disk.  The simple solution of deleting
the partition and reinstalling won't work because the program we use
has a database, backed up and infected.

Thanks for any help you may give me.

P.S. Any information on Stoned will probably be helpful, so don't

Hi,
the university I work for has had quite a few cases of infections
with the Form virus lately (at least it's detected by ViruScan 95 and
F-Prot 2.05 as Form virus).
The thing is: this virus wipes the harddisk after a number of boots.
This is not in VSUM. Furthermore, if a diskette in A: is infected and
you go to B:, copy a thing from A: and do a dir, B: is still not
infected? (B: 5-1/4, A: 3-1/2)
CleanUp can't clean it from 5-1/4, 360K diskettes, F-Prot can
(+ for F-Prot), that's just a note for McAfee.

I would like to suggest that the problem is more fundamental than
simply one of skill.  Writing a perfectly harmless virus requires a
perfect knowledge of the environment.  Not only must the writer
understand the execution environment perfectly, but he must also
understand the population perfectly.

Padgett observes:

>For instance, Michelangelo is known to foul up 720k floppies, not

>but because it *assumes* that all non-360k floppies are the same.

This is a simple oversight, but writing the perfectly harmless virus
requires this knowledge plus perfect knowledge of all other relevant
factors about every system in the population.  Such perfect knowledge
is impossible.

So I see, however, my submission was in the mail before Frisk had

As you can see from my posting, I only offered a plausible guess
given the brief description of the original poster.  I am not
surprised that the virus was different.  As for 1963 having
"nothing in common" with the Dark_Avenger virus, I will leave you
to argue this out with Patricia since she seems to disagree with
you here.  Again, I was only offering a best guess, as was noted by
my posting!?!  I am not sure why you wasted the band width to
revisit this since it was obvious to any reader that no definitive
answer was being provided.

While I must agree that VSUM does have its share of errors, and
provides little in the way of "down and dirty" technical
information, I still believe it is a good reference for ball-
parking whether you have a particular virus or not.  I have to
admit that I prefer the descriptions put out by Brunnestein's
students (including you) for accuracy, although the user-
friendliness of the lists containing these descriptions leaves
something to be desired.:-)

Wrong about Tequila, it infects just fine.  Remember, it is a
multi-partite virus and it does go TSR.

But this does imply that they are unlikely to represent a threat

No disagreement here.  Disassembly is obviously the best solution,
however, many users are not assembly programmers, and are unlikely
to be able to dis-assemble the virus.  Also, in cases where the
user notices changes in files (like the one we are speaking of) my
suggested technique works well.  I never said that it was "the only
way," or that it would be sufficient to completely describe any
virus, but it can provide important clues which could lead to a
sufficient understanding of the virus so that it can be dealt with,
or compared with other existing viruses to see if it is an existing
virus.  Also, continually bringing up viruses which have "new" and
"different" techniques that have often never been seen "in the
wild", or which are only the product of an active imagination may
be a useful academic exercise, but let's put some statistics next
to these viruses you have noted.  Have they infected any computers
at all other than in the lab?  Let's be reasonable!?!  I act as the
CERT for a network with over 350 servers, and 10,000 nodes.  In
addition, we have over 3000 lap-tops.  If I were "fishing" for
viruses this would represent a pretty large net.  Yet, we have seen
very few instances of other than the garden variety pests.  We have
anti-virus programs in place, and catch about 1 to 3 viruses a
month nation-wide, but have yet to see any of the viruses you
mention (other than Tequila which is fairly common in the USA).
Our employees are not discouraged from reporting viruses by
reprimands, but are encouraged and even commended when they report
a virus.  I think it's time we started being realistic about the
actual threat from these viruses.

I am glad that you have finally reached this conclusion. :-)  We
have been saying this for years!

Thanks for the clarification, I was just surprised that we were
giving lauds and praises (and free advertising) to manufacturers
who are just now beginning to do what Zenith did over 4 years ago,
that's all. :-)

Again, who said that securing a network was "obvious"?  Many
networks are set up in an unsecure way.  There are many reasons for
this: lack of understanding, lack of time, lack of expertise, it's
more difficult to secure a network properly than to just get it to
work correctly, no understanding of security principals or common
threats, etc.  It is good to have papers point out that the "most
obvious" ways of setting up a network are insecure, or that lack of
security in network environments is common, but this comes as no
surprise to security professionals.  No doubt this information (as
you related it) will be of use to Novell administrators, but only
if they understand that security is a priority, and then only if
they are given the resources by management to accomplish the task
of securing the network.  The bigger problem is that securing a
network which has been operating in a non-secure manner for some
time, is probably more of a political and managerial problem than
it is a technical one.  Ask anyone who has to do this for a living.

As I stated in my posting, I work in a Banyan environment, Fred's
paper has little if any relevance to my environment given that it
is Novell specific.  Also, it seems that you and others are just
getting into networks, be careful that you do not assume that
securing a single server represents mastery of the topic.  I
understand that Padgett may have sufficient experience to make this
claim, but I doubt that he is the "only" administrator to succeed
in successfully securing his network. :-)

Do you know how many DOS users rely on setting the DOS Attribute to
Read-only for protection?  But I see that this can be useful.

I know, and that's a good point.  However, I address this with
another control in the posting stating that administrators (super-
users) should maintain two accounts, one privileged, and one with
standard privileges, and that they should use the standard account
for day-to-day use. :-)

Vesselin, you are a master of restating the obvious.  Is there an
echo in here? :-)

I see no contradiction with my recommendations, especially since
the type of attack you suggest still does not represent a threat to
the network if you follow the above guidelines.

True, but again, this does nothing to contradict the usefulness of
the control I suggest, you merely have suggested another attack
which this control does not protect against.  Securing a network or
any computer is a matter of minimizing risk.  There is no such
thing as a 100% secure system.  I see little point in dwelling on
threats which present minimal risk when there are the more likely
threats of a disk crash, or accidental erasure, etc.  We would do
well to address these risks before worrying about the threat of
someone re-setting our path variable.

Thanks...I think.  The only thing which bothers me about the above
statement is that it infers two things, 1) That you are an
authority on the subject.  If this is so, it is commendable since
your postings indicate that you have only recently begun to work
with networks; 2) That there are some of my suggestions which are
not sound, if so, which ones?

  Hey, the artists had no hesitation showing a helicopter [that couldn't
hope to fly from DC to Colorado Springs -- but it does] taking off and
landing on grass at the Pentagon -- the tarmac helipad should be obvious
to anyone driving by on the West side of the Five-Sided Fun Factory.

  RAH's "If This Goes On" [published in 1953!] showed the logical
conclusion of televangelism: a theocratic dictatorship -- something I
consider FAR more dangerous than hacking, but your heart's in the right
place, Padgett.

  In issue #1 on the second page of "usr/hacker/mail" (what becomes
the letters section in later issues), in the upper right-hand corner,
Lewis Shiner (the creator of "THE HACKER FILES") says:

                     "These are  examples of the  intersec-
                   tion I'm  trying to  get between  comics

                   feedback  from  you.    One  way  is  to

                   us   at   the   address   shown   above.
                   Because   THE  HACKER  FILES   is   spe-

                   CompuServe    bulletin    boards.    The
                   best  of  the  mail we  receive  on-line

                   traditional   letters   that   come   in
                   envelopes."

Mr. Shiner must have been at least half-way successful as three of the
letters in issue #4 were posted through GEnie.  Try there.

Subject: Computer virus used for attempted blackmail


From UK newspaper "Daily Telegraph", Wed. 30 Sept 1992 p4 col4:-

<Lecturer in 'computer virus threat'>
  A university lecturer tried to blackmail a client company in a
dispute over pay by threatening to inject a computer virus into its
computer, Newcastle upon Tyne Crown Court was told yesterday. Do.Roy
Booth, 28, a computer studies expert, made the threat when the firm,
IMEC, of Washington, [a small town in] Tyne and Wear [in NE England,
<NOT> USA!], refused to pay his 400 pound hotel telephone bill after
he had flown to Phoenix, Arizona [USA], to develop a program for an
American company, the court heard. He had run up the bill in telephone
calls to his wife, who was pregnant. Mr.Christopher Prince,
prosecuting, said that Booth, of Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, retaliated
by placing a message in the company's computer which read: "Files are
being suitably modified so that strange things will begin to
happen...". Dr.Dooth, of Newcastle University, denies blackmail, but
Mr.Prince said: "It may be true that he didn't put the virus into the
machine, but the issue is whether he was making a demand for money
when menace.". The trial was adjourned until today.
