tha is your problem, There really is no need to Reformat the computer,
you can use a virus repair option. If you did a normal quick format
WITHOUT restoring the MBR+partition data+dos boot record then you
would have a problem. But Otherwise I cannot think of anything to
shoot it down with.

Subject: Michelangelo (again?, YEP!) (PC)

A follow-up on the false rumor and a couple of other points.  There
was a FALSE rumor about typing a certain phrase (Happy Birthday...)
to disable the Michelangelo virus.  I tracked it down and informed the
'sources'.  IT seems they got it confused with another virus and it
was spreading about as fast as the virus itself. (thanks to all who
replied especially Mr. Bontchev who provided more information B*)
Secondly, a reminder to SCAN off a known clean DOS disk.  It seems
that SCAN reports the STONED Virus is in memory and anyone who isn't
familiar with CLEAN might mistake what it says as saying it is cleaned
off (a person who is new to this procedure almost got fooled).  The
virus is correctly identified as Michelangelo if the memory is NOT
scanned (although when )mory is scanned, SCAN says to boot from floppy
which is VERY good!_ We also had a problem with the OHIO virus.  We
were tracking down the source of the Michelangelo and it pointed to
someone on a Novell network that had their systems infected with OHIO,
but we lost track of Michelangelo (bummer eh B*( )

It seems that as the date draws nearer, more people are posting about
it, but we will have to wait to see if there is MAJOR damage next
week.  I hope everyone will report that they found and removed it
instead of typing about the loss of data. (backups are great! If you
have a backup, you can reset your system date, pull it all back, then
remove the virus!)

Ladies and gentlemen:

I have the feeling that most of Michelangelo's impact will be felt
this week, as people take the effort to ensure that their systems are
clean.

Still, I have been charged with the task of "tracking" Michelangelo's
impact on Friday. I'll call the usual suspects and let everyone here
know what they say, but I would also like to collect some of <your>
phone numbers for my spot checks Friday.

So I'm writing to ask that you send me your phone, or that if you'd
rather, you call me at the number below on Friday and let me know of
any Michelangelo encounters.

Thank you for kind consideration.

Subject: Cinderella Virus (PC)

We had a minor out break of the Cinderella virus here at Harvey Mudd
College.  I looked it up in VSUM201 to see what it did then I
disassembled it.  After disassembling it I studied it to see how it
worked internal and found several discrepencies between what it did
and what VSUM201 said it did so I decided to post my conclusions
incase someone else cares.

Cinderella is a 390 byte resident infector of .COM files.  It will
infect any .COM files over 390 bytes when it is opened for any reason.
The virus will attach its code to the beginning of the file.  It moves
the int 21 handler to int E1h then points int 21h to itself.  It moves
the int 16h handler to int EFh.  It moves the int 24h handler to int
E2h so that no errors are displayed on attempts to infect write
protected disks.

Cinderella stays resident by moving the first 211 bytes of itself
(where is the rest?  anyone?) to 0000:0200h.  For this reason there is
no reduction in the available memory as displayed by chkdsk.  The
increased length of the .COM files (Usually 390 bytes but it added 397
once) will be displayed by dir.  Cinderella does no malicious damage.

Well thats my two cents.  If you have anything to add or if I am wrong
please let me know.

        I noticed something really weird when I came in contact with
Michelangelo today.  When I did a MEM /C it came up with:

     blem wit

in the output and it was taking up about 4K.
     I have tried to reproduce this message on other machines (in a
controlled environment), but I have not been able to (I suspect that
it only occurs when a hard drive is infected).

     Has anyone else come up with this message?  I don't know if it

looked normal.

Hmmm..these results conflict with reports I've had from two users.
But since you quote spcific numbers and since my customers did not, I
won't argue with your numbers.  I am of course to please to see both
IM and UT out speed McAfee's scanner. Please do note one point:

   You did not compare Integrity Master's quick check to UT's
   quick check.  From what you say, I understand they are not directly
   comparable, but since the full checks ARE comparable I believe the
   more valid comparison is between full check modes.  As shown by your
   table above, IM's full check is :28 faster than UT!

The discrepancy in our two scanners is in fact VERY important.
Since you quote the Virus Bulletin's report, let me do so also.

On page 22 they state:

  In tests UT was found to be unaware of stealth viruses and reported
  no changes to files when Tequila, Haifa, 4K and a host of other
  stealth viruses were memory-resident."

They also mention that since it didn't detect these viruses UT in fact
infected the other files that it was checking.  This is a serious
problem in my opinion.  Integrity Master will detect these viruses if
resident in memory or on disk.  (I know, I know -- they should cold
boot from a known good copy of DOS on diskette, but the fact remains
that many users won't do this) I took a survey during one of my
lectures and asked the roughly 100 people there who consistently used
an anti-virus product if they booted from floppy before checking.
None did!  (Sad -- I know!)

A good explanation of generic checking! Integrity Master does all
you state for UT except the generic disinfection of files.  Naturally
Integrity Master can restore MBR and boot sectors.

You raise a big personal gripe of mine.  I have seen the ads for UT.
They make claims that I simply can not believe. Look at both the VB
review and what we know UT does!  It is very difficult for me to compete
against a product that makes claims like this. (I guess I could make
claims like this for IM, but I refuse to do so) Can anyone present any
evidence that their claim is true that they can generically disinfect
any virus????  From what I understand, they save a 40 byte area from the
begining of every file plus the type of integrity information IM
collects which includes file length. There are viruses which can not be
removed based on this information.  Of course any overwriting virus
which clobbers more than the saved 40 bytes could not be removed either
(if what I understand about UT is correct). Why am I complaining about
this?  Because people take virus removal claims at face value and come
to depend upon these products for virus removal. They are then are in
trouble if the removal can't happen.

Counter summary <g>:

  1) If you compare full integrity checking modes, Integrity Master is
     faster.

  2) Yes, IM does not do generic disinfection beyond system sector
     restoring, but I think UT's ability to do this is questionable.

  3) Missing common memory resident viruses as reported by VB is in my
     opinion a fatal flaw in that version of UT.


All that said, let me acknowledge that UT is in fact a fine product.
I wish they would make their advertising a little more reasonable.
Since our two products have much in common I would be crazy to say that
there isn't a whole lot that I like in UT.  And, of course, I fully expect
UT to correct its scanner deficiency shortly.  And *I* will be
improving Integrity Master during the same time also <g>!  BTW, the
current version is 1.11 released on Feb 17th.

I believe that I encountered the same problem with the TURBO.TPL file
from Turbo Pascal 5.5 and F-Prot 1.16 or possibly 2.0.  This problem
does *not* occur with 2.02D, and was presumably a false positive.  The
Kamikazi virus is quite rare, being described as 'Endangered' in Patricia
Hoffman's VSUM document.  The Kamikazi virus only attempts to infect .EXE
files, and could only be in the TURBO.TPL file if a new variant or placed
there by a trojan dropper.  Also, Kamikazi overwrites the beginning of an
infected file, which would kill the TURBO.TPL file.  And since the .TPL
file will never be executed as an .EXE, it couldn't spread (it couldn't
get into a program compiled by Turbo Pascal).

If the TURBO.TPL file is damaged, Turbo Pascal will give a 'Unit file
format error TURBO.TPL.  Press ESC. ' error message upon starting up.
Thereafter any attempt to compile will result in a 'Unit not found
SYSTEM.TPU' error.  The command line compiler reports 'Error 72: Unit
file format error (TURBO.TPL)'.  The exact error message may vary (only
tested TP 5.5), but every version of Turbo Pascal from 4.0 through 6.0
and including TP for Windows checks the signature at the beginning of
all .TPL and .TPU files and will refuse to compile if infected with
Kamikazi (or damaged otherwise).

So if Turbo Pascal is still working, it's a false positive from F-Prot.
Fix: upgrade to the latest version.  I have tested and this problem does
*not* occur with Turbo Pascal 5.5 and F-Prot 2.02D.

   In a recent message I said that Turbo Pascal would refuse to use a
damaged TURBO.TPL file.  I should have noted that it only checks the
first four bytes for a signature, and so would only detect damage to
those bytes.  (Kamikazi does indeed damage the first four bytes of an
infected file, although it is practically impossible for the TURBO.TPL
file to be infected with Kamikaze.)

Note that it is possible to infect a diskette by doing a DIRectory of
it if the computer is already infected (the virus is in memory), as
Martin correctly notes.  This is undoubtably where the confusion in
the article arose from.  It is important to stress, however, that it
is possible to infect a floppy merely by viewing a directory of it
from an infected computer, even though it is not possible to infect a
computer by viewing a directory of an infected floppy.  Do not fail to
scan a floppy when cleaning up after an infection on the grounds that
you, "only did a directory of it."

Subject: Request for Michelangelo advice (PC)

I am a member of the support staff at the University of Chicago.  We
have been trying to inform our community about the Michelangelo virus
and are also trying to set up a mechanism for dealing with viruses
here.  The situation has become a little more critical since we have
found the virus on campus and don't know how far it has spread.  I
have been reading through the postings on this group and have gotten a
great deal of information from them but I have severel questions...

We have been distributing VIRx to our users to check for viruses.  It
found Michelangelo on several computers.  A user tried to use it to
remove the virus but said that it had to remove the file to remove the
virus.  We haven't been able to get back in touch with this user to
make sure that's really what happened but it doesn't seem to make alot
of sense.  I was wondering if anyone could let us know what VIRx does
to remove Michelangelo.  Does it destroy anything?  I have also heard
a little about Norton's free utility to remove Michelangelo.  I
believe I saw a posting about it that said it worked but was clunky...
other opinions?  does it remove the virus safely?  I have also seen
discussion in this group about using Fdisk /MBR to remove
Michelangelo.  Does this involve re-partitioning and then reformatting
the drive? or does it just rebuild the MBR leaving everything else on
the drive untouched?

VIRx has also turned up alot of Stoned infections.  We were exploring
different methods of dealing with these and other infections.  One
proposal was to purchase a service license for McAfee's CleanUp and
have users bring their computers to our service center.  How safe is
this program and others?  I have seen postings about CleanUp
destroying some data when removing the Michelangelo virus but no
confirmation.

We were also trying to form some sort of strategy for dealing with
people that have been struck with the virus this Friday. I have
several impressions about what to do and are wondering if they make
sense.  If people have backups of their files, they need to remove the
virus, check their disks, and then restore their files.  Is the MBR or
boot sector destroyed?  Do they need to re-format their disk before
they can do anything?  If people have no backups and will need their
data recovered, were do they turn?  Is it true that Norton and other
common disk utilities can't help recover from Michelangelo.  How
sophisticated a recovery service is needed for this?

Please reply to me at gun6@midway.uchicago.edu.  I will post the
reponses I get although some of the information may be useful to
others struggling to prepare for March 6th and perhaps should just be
posted.

As far as I know, it is just as good as PROTEC.COM, i.e., it traps Int
13h and will provide no protection against (master) boot sector
infectors.  It will prevent trojans and stupid user mistakes (Oh, that
sequence of commands would make the Norton Utilities copy garbage onto
the boot sector, oops).  Question for Vesselin: Would such programs
stop file infectors (assuming the protection program was loaded before
the virus got control (which assumes the protection program was not
infected)), or what?  My guess is that such programs would be proof
against file infectors, given the assumptions in the question.

Hitting the RESET button momentarily interrupts power to the
microprocessor, causing it to reset.  (On 286's and above, it comes up
in real mode.)  The chip hands control to whatever is at 0fff0:0f000
just like it did when you powered up the machine.  This address
contains, for reasons that should be painfully obvious :-), the
beginning of the Power On Self Test in the ROM BIOS.  This is
basically a cold boot.  The high memory (640k through beginning of
ROM) is searched for ROM extensions (of peripherals) which are handed
control.  The entire interrupt vector table is built from scratch.  NO
PROGRAM CAN SURVIVE THIS PROCESS.  PERIOD.

Two things the ROM BIOS does NOT do, which it should: First, it
doesn't bother to save the original registers of the CPU, which for
later chips (386+) contains info identifying the chip.  People who
write code that tries to determine which chip is in the computer hate
the BIOS writers for this.

Second, after it has completed the above process, it performs no
integrity checking of any kind on the Master Boot Record or Boot
Sector it loads before handing control to it.  People who write
anti-viral code hate the BIOS writers for *that*.

All in all, the BIOS writers get a pretty bad rap.  But, they deserve
it.  I have this dream, that if we all start bugging the hell out of
IBM, AMI, Award, Phoenix, and American Megatrends, that maybe, just
maybe they might get a clue and make some improvements to their code.
Wishful thinking?  You decide.

I have received a great amount of help on this. I want to thank all of
you. My co-worker has contacted Microcomm and sent them a copy of the
file that is supposed to be infected, if and when I learn more, I will
post what he tells me.

Subject: FDISK /MBR with stealth viruses? (PC)

(Sorry to post so much lately.  Must remind self that I'm not the only
person in the world with answers to some simple questions.)

The DOS 5.0 FDISK /MBR solution for MBR infectors has been oft
repeated here, but I wonder: FDISK replaces the bootstrap loader but
not the partition table in the MBR, right?  So that requires that the
virus hasn't changed (moved) the partition table, which is a given if
the virus is not a stealth virus.  But if a stealth mbr infector such
as EDV perhaps (?) moves the whole MBR including PT to another sector,
redirecting accesses to there, and overwrites the MBR with something
completely different, then won't rebooting with a clean disk and doing
FDISK /MBR leave garbage in the PT, rendering all partitions
inaccessable?

Or are there no viruses which ever really remove the PT from the MBR?

Or have I missed something?

Or are we advising users to do something potentially very dangerous?

Did Microsoft not document the /MBR switch for a good reason?

Subject: Brain Virus (PC)

   Hi.  A few years ago, I had a problem with my computer.  Everyone
so often, my computer screen BLACKED out on me.  I tried typing and
stuff, but nothing happened.  At that time, my technical knowledge on
virii's weren't deep enough, nor did I even bother using Virii
detection software.  Well I had to reboot my system and it would work,
but after that, it would still black out.  So I thought, "would I have
a virus?" so I 'backed up' my HD and formated my HD.  After that I
restored my stuff back on and everything was normal.

    Well, a few days later, I was in need of some empty disks, so I
searched through my Disk collection for empty ones(doing lots of "DIR
A:/W", when suddenly, in one of my disks, I saw "(C) Brain" or
something like that in the Volume Label.  At that particular moment, I
didn't know what it was about, so I just reformatted that disk(the
disk contained nothing), and went along with my life..  Then a year
later, after being MORE Virus-literate, I had a flashback on that
particular 'event' but couldn't do anything about it as I have
formated the 'virus' contained Disk.  I searched the rest of my disk
collection and found no virus.(to my relief)

     Well. Up to now, I haven't asked any questions, just made some
explanations, now here comes the question.  I was wondering if the
aforementioned 'screen' problems were caused by the Brain virus?

     While I'm at it... I was wondering, what's the latest version of
McAffee's Scan program?  I've got V.85(or something like that).  Rumor
has it that V.86(87) is actually a bogus version.. Anyone know about
this?

While VSHIELD might run in the DOS compatibility box of OS/2 1.x (I
haven't actually tested it), it won't do you much good because
whenever you switch from the DOS box to an OS/2 program, the DOS box,
and any program running in it, is suspended until you go back to it.
Thus, it would only be useful to run VSHIELD in the DOS box if you
never switch out of it, which would be impossible on an OS/2 server.
When OS/2 2.0 becomes available, the DOS virtual machines (running in
386 protected mode) will continue to run, even in the background, but
VSHIELD would only detect viral activity in the virtual DOS machines
and leave most of the OS/2 system memory unprotected.

Unfortunately, there are no OS/2-specific antiviral programs yet that
I know of (the IBM Virus Scanning program, however, will scan under
both DOS and OS/2).  I think most antiviral program companies are
waiting to see whether OS/2 sinks or swims with release 2.0 before
committing resources to OS/2 versions.  I understand that there will
soon be an OS/2 version of Dr. Solomon's Antivirus Toolkit, but I
haven't seen it yet.  Hope this helps.

Subject: Can DOS viruses run under SUN DOS Windows? (PC) (UNIX)

I am running DOS Windows 1.0 on a SUN Sparcstation 1+. While DOS
Windows does a creditable job of creating a window that behaves like
an 80286, I hadn't seriously worried about viruses until the recent
Michaelangelo scare.  I can think of a number of good reasons why
low-level hack jobs like viruses wouldn't be expected to run in this
kind of environment:

- - All files are actually Unix files, and a utility called the
'redirector' lets DOS access these files.

- - Write permissions are set by Unix.

- - DOS Windows is not really a 286. Although it runs what appears to be
the off-the-shelf Phoenix ROM BIOS, I have found that not all DOS
programs work in this environment. In particular, while Turbo Pascal
can compile programs here, many TP programs simply don't run. (MS
Pascal works just fine, probably because it doesn't try to do as many
bizarre low-level things as TP).

- - The C: disk is not really a disk at all, but a file that looks, to
DOS, like a disk.

Given these and a host of other low-level differences from a real PC,
I would think that most viruses probably wouldn't work. Am I wrong in
thinking so?

Have there been any documented cases of DOS Windows (or any of the
other SUN DOS emulators) getting infected?

Has anyone tried infecting one of these emulators, or found out after
using virus-infected disks that they were infected, but hadn't harmed
the system?

Has any one tried virus detection software in such an environment? I
am wondering if low-level SUN-specific patches in the system might
actually cause a false detection by a virus detection program
expecting to see a real DOS system.

I would especially appreciate hearing from those out there with DOS
Windows experience.

Get a decent virus checker. Theres one called 'Virus Checker' and get
BootX3.80 which shows memory locations which viruses may attack. BootX
will also scan for file viruses which is quite useful.

If your booting from a not infected disk and you experience no
problems then it probably suggest you may have one of the little
blightters.!!

'Virus Checker' can be obtained from ab20(need ftp access) or most
probably from your PD dealer. The same goes fro 'BootX'

Hope Ive been helpful....

Subject: Re: Manufacturing of software (GENERAL)

There are probably as many different ways of duplicating software as
there are companies publishing software.  The software publishers I
have worked with have all used outside duplicating companies, with
varying success.  In terms of virus protection, the results are not
encouraging.

One company had changed duplicators twice shortly before I started
working there.  the reason had been poor quality, and the current
duplicators were not doing a terrific job.  The batches, at the
company, were quite small (runs of five to twenty copies at a time)
and we had one or two batches per month (of about five) that had
problems.  That was problems with the entire batch: a number of bad
copies (about 3 out of fifty) slipped by into the field.  This would
be completely unacceptable in a larger company, I suspect this company
got shoddy work because of the small volume.

Another company did runs of one to two hundred at a time, and got much
better quality.  However, errors did arise.  All masters were checked
(I know, my people did the checking) before being shipped to the
duplicators, and a random sample (well, a sample, anyway) was checked
when we received the product.  There were some cases where the master
had been damaged by the duplication company before duplication and the
copies were all exact copies of the damaged disks.  There were other
errors introduced at the duplicators at times.

In all cases, however, the responsibility for detecting the errors was
in teh hands of the publisher, not the duplicator.
