VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  (The complete set of posting guidelines is available by
FTP on cert.sei.cmu.edu or upon request.)  Please sign submissions
with your real name.  Send contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU

     I happen to be one of the last XT users and PROUD OF IT.

     but I apologize for this, but from reading the above message
as well as the originating one, I was wondering if the Michaelangelo
virus would infect XT's(or Turbo XT's for that matter)?

    I know..I know.. I haven't been up to date with this virus that's
supposedly gonna kill some systems on March 6th.   Since there is still
some time for my preparations for this virus, can you or someone who'se
reading this, tell me what the hell is the Michaelangelo virus and
what it does?

    Btw, how about the Friday 13th of March? Isn't there supposed to
be a Virus that goes by that name?  Friday the 13th March is NEXT week,
so anyone gonna prepare for it?

    One more thing,  last year in October, I remembered that there was
one Virus scare.  Can't remember the virus itself, but from what I've
heard, nothing really happened.  Is this just some scare?   Hmm
was it the October virus? 8)

Subject: accessing non-existing HD (PC)

I found 2 arguments in the discussion started by Vesselin.
1) I do not think that a virus is able to access a HD which does "not exist"
   according to the CMOS-information. Reason: if it would be possible to find
   out, then we would not have to tell BIOS, that there is a HD and what para-
   meters it should use. Even programs like Norton won't find a disk, when the
   BIOS is not set for it.
2) I do think that it might be possible. Reason: I read one of these thick books
   where I found information on floppydisk-controllers and how to program them.
   It even described the opcodes to be used and waht messages come back. I know,
   it is only information on floppy-controllers, but: as we can exchange our HDs
   and controllers as we like and do not have load a new version of IO.SYS there
   needs to be a kind of standard for communication. So, this is why I think,
   that a HD can be accessed although. One guy said, that this would produce a
   BIOS-LEVEL error. I don't think so. What, if the virus behaves like a BIOS?
   Additionally there is nothing, that protects you, from setting wrong para-
   meters in your setup, i.e. your HD has 680 cylinders, but you can define it
   as a disk with 1024. The result will be(I've heard it myself), that the heads
   bang against the end of where the can go. NO ERRORMESSAGES!!! You should not
   do this unless you want to destoy your HD. But viri normally don't care too
   much about safety. The only errormessage we got, was from the lowlevelprogram
   which said something about a readerror. This might be a reason, why BIOSs can
   not find out the parameters of your drive, and is a possible reason, why viri
   might do the job although!

Subject: Glitch in Padgett's fixutil3.zip collection of utilities (PC)

The following information comes from the recently released fixutil3.zip
package of utilities by A. Padgett Peterson, obtained directly from the
ftp site urvax.urich.edu and McAfee Associates' Validate program v0.3:

File Authentication:

     Check Method 2 - 1264

- -=-=-

As you can see, the CRC-16's of check method 1 do not agree.  As you can
also see, CM2 does agree, the validation information is in a different
format which looks as if typed by hand instead of redirected from the
program's output, and the checksum is very similar (a 'B' for an '8').
All other files in the package validate'd.  Apparently an error on
Padgett's part.  If you trust me, then consider 97-B as in Bravo-8 to
be the correct checksum.  If you don't, wait for the acknowledgement
from Padgett which will follow.  :-)  I send this to avert tons of
messages reporting this (assuming that tons of people out there actually
check these checksums (you do, don't you?!?)).

Note to moderator: no cc sent to VALERT-L.  Do so if you see fit.
Note to Padgett: I know how much neater the columnar format in your
validate.24 file is, but you ought to redirect validate's output and
then edit it down instead of error-prone retyping.

Sorry to almost certainly waste bandwidth, but I downloaded an anti-
viral program and its checksums didn't check, what else could I do?
If you've gotten this and installed it, relax.  It's obviously human
error, plus I scanned the sucker with VIRx 2.0, SCAN 86-B and F-PROT
2.02D and Frisk's Heuristic scanner and I gave Scan and F-Prot the
recently published signature for TROI (I know, supposed to be a .COM
infector, but I searched FIXMBR.EXE for it anyway), and everything
came up clean.

 In theory, no. In fact, you can get in trouble if you MBR has been

  Well, there are two cases:
(a) You infect a compressed file (external infection in SCAN nomenclature):
  If the virus is cleanable, you can make it.
(b) You compress a infected file (internal infection in SCAN nomenclature):
  You must UNLZEXE or UNPKLITE and clean the program.
(Note: Any good antivirus program _must_ be capable of search for a compressed
infected program)
In any case: is better wipe the infected file and restore from a backup.

This might be what happens if keyboard scanning somehow doesn't catch
the shift/ctrl/alt key not being pressed anymore. I am not sure if
this is a hardware, BIOS code or operating system problem, but it
always seems to be corrected by pressing and then releasing the very
same shift key that caused the phenomenon.

From:    M.Meijer@cc.ruu.nl (Maarten Meijer)
Subject: More about CLEAN 8.3B86 and the Form virus (PC)

After a little more experimenting (McAfee asked me for more details) I
must conclude that in *most* cases CLEAN isn't able to remove the Form
virus, whether it (the virus) resides on hard disk or on floppies, and
whatever DOS version you are using.

- --> Don't use CLEAN to remove the FORM virus from your hard disk, as it
    will become unaccessible afterwards!!! Use SYS C: (the DOS command)
    instead (starting with a clean, write-protected floppy of course).

The only case in which CLEAN was successful, was on a system booted
with MS-DOS 3.3 where the virus had to be removed from a 360K floppy
formatted with MS-DOS 3.3. All other attempts to remove the virus from
floppy or hard disk, whatever DOS version booted with or formatted the
infected disk, how many partitions on the hard disk, and whatever hard
disk size (20, 40 or >=60 MB), failed. (All hard disks with standard
FDISK-mbr and a bootable C-partition).

On hard disks, CLEAN takes a random sector from the disk and puts it
in place of the bootsector. I could trace the original location of
this sector.  On floppy disks, CLEAN tells that it has found the Form
virus in "1 file" (meaning the boot sector, I suppose), but that it
isn't able to correctly replace it.

If in fact your hard disk has become unaccessible to DOS, use a sector
editor to locate the original bootsector on your hard disk. The Form
virus puts it at the last *physical* sector of the disk, no matter how
many partitions you have. From there you (or your disk wizzard) can
copy it back the original location - which is *not* the first physical
sector!  Beware of overwriting the *master* boot record!

David is exactly right. This was an old error and the value *should*
be 97B8 instead of 9788 (didn't I post an apology about this once
before - just my aging & store-bought eyes). Thought I had corrected
it. The reason I went to the different format was so that it would all
fit on a single screen.

BTW, this is the archive (FixUtil3) that contains the programs
previously mentioned - mostly freeware (all is free until March 7 &
has been for a month) and the two Shareware elements are only a buck.

	No we do not run any memory resident virus utilities on these
machines, in general.  And I actually got these results running on a
clean vanilla DOS-only machine.  A good guess, but it was one
possibility that we had eliminated.  The other aspect that throws me
off, is that we got the infections without booting off the infected
floppy.  A series of DIR and executions of programs would result in
the virus in memory.  We are having quite a problem with it, since we
cannot detect it on floppies, and so cannot effectively control the
spread.
	In one lab, the autoexec simply rebuilds the system with every
boot using the SYS command, in another, we check the drives every morning
and disinfect 1-2 machines (out of 20) every day.
	It is becomming a problem.  Of course, we don't worry about
MICHAELANGELO much :-).

F-prot V2.04d reports a file called BUGRES.COM has "Bugsres-2 Joke

I couldn't find anything in the documentation about it, and it appears
to be a harmless :-) screen eating TSR utility.  The machine is
"disinfected" by removing the program.  What does it all mean?  I am a
little confused why f-prot reports it at all?  Is it a potential

anything with it (or suggest that I do)?

I have several questions concerning the Michelangelo and JOSHI virus.
I have been trying to inform our users about checking for viruses.  In
the last few days we have found numerous instances of Michelangelo,
JOSHI and stoned.  I have several questions.

(1)  Is there an easy way to detect the JOSHI virus without using
     SCAN.  We have 3000 PC's and we can't get around to check each
     one of these in the time alloted.

(2)  Once Michelangelo hits a machine on Friday, is there any way
     of restoring the data.  I am in panic mode about what could
     or could not happen on Friday.

Any help would be interested.

When we were infected with the [Plastique] virus, I tried using McAfee
SCAN and CLEAN to rid our system.  The problem is that CLEAN claimed
that Plastique was found in memory and could not remove it from the
diskette.  How did it get in memory?  Of course, I booted the system
with a write-protected DOS diskette and used SCAN on a write-protected
floppy?

Subject: Qusetions about fprot (PC)

As a new user of fprot, I have several questions that I hope someone
will be able to anwser for me:

1) In the virus list, some virus names are in yellow text while
   others are in white. What does this mean? I cannot find anything
   about it in the documentation.

2) I'm using version 2.02d to scan a machine, and it detects the "SBC"
   virus in an executable (c:\dosexts\autotime.exe). There is no "SBC"
   virus in the list of viruses, only an "SVC" virus. Is this just
   a typo in the report? Does it really mean "SVC"?

3) The SBC/SVC virus mentioned in item 2, above, goes undetected
   by CPAV. CPAV also only has SVC not SBC in its list. How can I
   tell if the file is really infected? Fprot said infected files
   would contain a particular text string if infected with SVC,
   but I did not see that string in the "infected" file.

4) When I sacnned the same machine using heuristics (instead of
   secure scan, as done above, and ALL files instead of just
   standard executables, as above, fprot says there are 402
   suspicious files, but NONE are infected (i.e. it "misses"
   the alleged SBC/SVC in autotime.exe). I guess I can understand
   this given the nature of heuristic scanning, but can someone
   "confirm" this behaviour for me?

5) After the heuristic scan mentioned in item 4, I tried to save
   the file (f-prot did not let me view it on screen from within
   fprot). When I quit fprot and tried to look at the report file
   it was 0 bytes long.

In general, fprot looks like a great program, and much of what I
report above is probably explainable in some fashion, but I wonder if
there aren't some bugs here?

     We experienced similar problem recently.  A WYSE 286 computer had
trouble not only diring the a: drive, it even overwrite diskette with
contents it "remembered".  Eventually the disk drive broke down and a
new disk drive works fine.  So I suspect it is caused by the disk
driver rather than virus.  The disk drive developed the sympton is a
FUJITSU 1.2MB 51/4 disk drive.
     We have other PCs running in the lab and we have a lot of data
exchange between them.  If it is virus, it would infect others but
only one computer have this problem.

Infection vector(s):
     There appear to be two possible infection vectors: 1 - an infected
     computer at the person's home, 2 - DOS diskettes shipped with the
     computer.  My money is definitely on #1.
     The person's home computer was discovered to be infected due to other
     infections in this local area (Salt Lake City, Utah).  There have
     been several reports of infections being discovered at some of the
     higher ed. schools.  This person's son-in-law was infected from one of
     these locations.  In the process of testing his home computer, he
     decided to check the computer in question, and discovered that it was
     infected as well.  This was relayed to the person here who proceeded
     to rush to my office in panic - "What do I do now?????"  I told him
     I would prepare a "clean" diskette for him to take home and fix his
     home computer.  Since he has the same computer at home as here I was
     going to use his computer here to prepare this diskette.  Also, I
     don't have a 5.25 drive on my computer.  I was fixing the diskette,
     getting ready to copy F-PROT onto it, and decided to just check, just
     in case.  Much to my surprise there was the red/yellow box saying
     Michelangelo is here.  From there I proceeded to disinfect his machine
     here, as well as 6 floppies that were also infected.
     The infected floppies were all manufacturers diskettes with DOS, VGA
     drivers, and stuff on them (they were NOT write protected from the
     manufacturer either!).  But not all the diskettes that came with the
     machine were infected.  Also, this man's son had been playing games
     with questionable origins on the home computer and had wiped out the
     root directory of the home computer.  I am told that the infected
     diskettes were used to rebuild the home computer.  So that combined
     with the fact that not all the manufacturer's diskettes were infected
     leads me to suspect the son and his games.  I can't be 100% on that
     but I am comfortable with that assumption.

I don't speak for the entire campus here at the University of Utah.  I manage
a 150+ node Novell Network.  This one machine is the only infected PC I've
heard about or seen here.  I have heard of at least three other schools here
in Utah that have had trouble with Michelangelo but can't confirm any of
them.

Subject: Norton AV Problem-- Destroyed Extended Partition??? (PC)

   Our group PC's were infected with th Michaelangelo virus. As a result,
several of our home systems were infected as well. We obtained a copy of
the Norton Anti-Vrus Michaelangelo Edition and used it to clean the virus
out.
   One of our fearless leaders owns a 386/40 running MSDOS 5.0 with a
120 MB Quantum IDE hard drive, divided into 2 partitions (partitioning
and formatting were done with MSDOS 5). Well, the NAV found the virus
on his system, and he proceeded to clean it out as instructed. The virus
is gone now, but so is his extended partition!!!
   I have not taken a look at his system yet (he lives in another county),
and of course I have had no luck getting through to Symantec's support
humans.
   We've had no similar problems with this package, and I can't think
of any reason why this might have happened (considering the type of
viral infection and the manner of cure). Any ideas, suggestions or
similar experiences are solicited!

In a previous article, rajwan@brachot.jct.ac.il (yair rajwan) writes:

There are two ways in which a file compressed with PKLITE or LZEXE (or
other file compression programs) can be infected.

If the file is infected after it has been compressed, then scanners
(should) treat it as a normal file.

If, however, it was infected before it was compressed, then the virus
code itself will also be compressed, making standard scanning useless,
since compression, in general, will change the appearance of code. To
detect the virus in this case, the scanner must decompress the file,
and then check it for signatures (or whatever). SCAN v85 does this for
LZEXE-compressed files (I think).

Because compression changes the appearance of files, if a previously
infected file is compressed, then it is quite likely to be reinfected,
since the virus will not be able to detect that it has, in fact,
infected the file before.

>if yes: is there any program that clean the virus from the compressed
>file?

If the file was infected after compression, then it can be disinfected
normally.

If the file was infected before compression, then it is nececcary to
decompress it first, and then disinfect it.

Finally, if the file was infected both before and after compression, then
it is necessary to disinfect it, decompress it, and then disinfect the
decompressed file.

I don't think, though, that any of the major virus disinfectors will
disinfect compressed files yet (Frisk, Aryeh - there's a nice job for you ;-)

I crave the indulgence of Ken, and all the VIRUS-L readers, but:

On this Friday, March 6, CBC radio has asked me to participate in a
"phone in" show regarding the effect of the Michelangelo virus.  I
would like to have reports of Michelangelo "disasters" (or fizzles)
"as they happen", by phone or email.  (I am sure Ken would second my
request that you *not* post them to the net.)  I recall the request
for more detailed reports next week: all I want is a quick survey as
you find the evidence (and time.)

I will be calling in to the sfu and cue sites for email (as well as
local BBSes) and will be taking calls at (604) 988-4097 and 984-4067.
The phone number for the CBC studio will be (604) 669-3733.  (Please
do not call before 1400H GMT/ 0600H PST.)

Thank you in advance for any and all reports.

Subject: Mac users and PC/MS-DOS Viral Programs (Mac)

	Due to my concern for Macintosh users of PC-emulating software
	and hardware, I asked for advice and received the following
	excellent response:


> From: Chris McDonald ASQNC-TWS-R-SO <cmcdonal@wsmr-emh03.army.mil>
> Subject: Answer to Question on PC/MS-DOS Viral Programs
> Date: Wed, 4 Mar 92 13:45:18 MST

Having tested 18 anti-viral MS-DOS/PC-DOS programs, I would personally
recommend F-PROT by Fridrick Skulason for those on a restricted budget
and those interested with one scanning feature which I have not seen
advertised in other freeware, shareware and commercial programs:
namely, a heuristic scanning option which looks for "viral
characteristics" rather than just for a specific signature.  F-PROT
detects and disinfects and has a TSR component to block infected
programs from running.

Those interested in speed of scanning with no adverse impact on
detection efficiency should consider VIRx, which is approximately
one-third of the commercial Virex-PC program marketed by Microcom.
VIRx is a detector only; Virex-PC is a detector, disinfector, and
prevention program.

The large commercial vendors, Microcom (VIREX-PC), Central Point
(CPAV), Symantec (NAV), XTree (ViruSafe), have good products depending
upon what your specific requirements are, the expertise of your user
community, and the funds available to your organization for such
protection.  Fifth Generation Systems has recently entered the market,
but I have not yet tested their product.  All these products offer
detection, disinfection, and prevention features.

IBM has an EXTREMELY reasonable product, the IBM Anti-Virus Product,
which offers numerous detection options and a site license cost of
$35.00 total for an entire installation or activity--no limit on
number of PCs which can load the software.  The problem here is that
it is only a detector, with a seemingly haphazard method of updating.

The National Computer Security Association (NCSA) periodically updates
its report on virus detection software.  Its latest report is January
1992.  I also have individual product test reports on those programs I
have personally evaluated.  Ken maintains the reports on the Virus-L
repository at CERT; John Wack and Marianne Swanson maintain these test
reports and other on the NIST security BBS.  I would always recommend
that one have or have access to at least two different programs to
filter out false positive alarms, program incompabilities, and the
potential for one vendor to close up shop.

I agree with the idea that the Operating System (OS) on ALL PCs (MAC,
DOS, UNIX, etc) needs to be setup to protect itself from this type of
software invasion, but is this kind of thing possible?  If it is
possible, would it be too difficult to implement?  And, if not difficult
to implement, then how do we get it implemented?  And, is this the place
to be discussing it? (In other words, this should be directed to the OS
developers.  I am saying that I am glad to see the idea come up, and that
this needs to be looked at very closely.  The OS developers need to do
this, if they aren't already working on it.)
