Subject: "Closing" your HardDisk (PC)

   I saw that some guys are interested in that stuff,so here it is:
This is a little BATCH program which is supposed to "close" the HD:
(First iI have to mention that You have to have the DEBUG program which
should exist on your DOS diskette!)
C:>COPY CON:NOHARD.SCR
A100
MOV AX,0040
MOV DS,AX
MOV BYTE PTR[0075],00
INT20
RCX
C
NNOHARD.COM
W
Q
press F6 and then ENTER
...
...
C:>DEBUG <NOHARD.SCE
...
...
C:>DEL NOHARD.SCR
At this stage there should exist already a file named NOHARD.COM of 12K.
I hope this program will help you

P.S.:At lines 1 and 5,i writed A100 and INT20 respectively,but it MAY not
     work!If that thing will happen,just write A 100 and INT 200
     respectively..*That* one must work!(I hope so!:) )
P.P.S.:I have other nice programs and "tip"s like that.Just call me!

Subject: Novell Anti-Virus??? (PC)

Due to all of the recent activity and hype about virus infections
arround the world...  We are now looking for a good public domain or
other virus checking and disinfecting program for our three new Novell
file servers.  Any recomendations?

We already have F-Prot from Frisk on every one of our MS-Dos machines, and
Virex on all of our Macintosh equipment.  This is the last hole that needs
to be plugged.

Any help would be appreciated...

Despite all of our efforts, which include placinf F-prot on, (or so we
thought,) every MS-Dos machine in our College... We have had another
outbreak of Stoned B in our Information Center... Seems that somehow
that depart either was missed, or had the software removed..... 12
infected PC's, and one in another department with Friday/13th.  Where
is this information normally recorded?  Our source of the infection
seems to be, still, Kent State Graduate/Medical students bringing in
their disks from KSU and using them on our machines.

It has nothing to do with Michelangelo.  This is a common problem with
DOS-5 and certain versions of the Novell redirector shell (NET5.COM)
and, possibly, other TSR's.  Somehow, DOS gets confused and sees the
data area in NET5.COM as a program title.  This is actually part of an
error message text string that reads:

   There is a problem with the Memory Control Block for the shell
                 ^^^^^^^^

I first noticed this in the DOS5 beta.  I immediately thought that
Microsoft had sent me an infected set of disks.  However, no
anti-virus product could find a problem.  So I did a string search on
the entire disk for "blem wit" and found the only place it existed was
in NET5.COM that accompanies the DOS 5 upgrade.

Although this string still exists in more recent versions of NETX.COM,
I've not seen the problem for some time.

Subject: FDISK /MBR and Stealth viruses. (PC)

I don't know of any viruses that don't leave a partition table intact
in the master boot record.  (Not that ignorance means much :) If you
boot DOS and there isn't a partition table, then the hard drive isn't
accessible.  A virus that did this would be security software in a
sense, because it would disable access to the hard drive if a floppy
was booted.  The suggestion to use FDISK /MBR only after a) cold
booting from the DOS 5 Install diskette and b) checking that the C:
drive (and any other drives) is present, covers most of the dangerous
possibilities.  Not all; it is possible to repartition the hard disk
after it has been infected with an MBR infector in such a way that
FDISK /MBR makes things worse, or at least different.  (For example,
the original master boot record decides what the active partition is
based on the contents of the original master boot record, not the
partition table in head 0 track 0 sector 1.)  I'm sure that there are
other cases where there might be a problem as well.  On balance,
however, FDISK /MBR (and programs that do basically the same thing) is
better than a program that dumbly copies sector 7 (or whatever) to
sector 1, without checking that the virus is the known version, and
that sector 7 is a boot record and without checking that the two
copies of the master boot record are the same.  In my experience.

Subject: False reports from vshield 86b? (PC)

Greetings all, and especially McAfee.

I am trying to figure what the heck is happening with what appears to
be a false validation change report.

I am using the most current McAfee clean, scan, and virus shield.  We
have been testing different virus protection products, but all of
these problems occurred when I booted from a clean floppy with the
McAfee products on them, installed virus shield, ran scan adding
validation for all files, and then ran virus shield.  It keeps
reporting a change in c:\dos\command.com, but the facts beg to differ
with their reports.  The file size is the same, and does not change,
and even scan reports no virus, so there is nothing to clean (I tried
[genb] and everything else I could think of).  F-protection reports no
problems.

What is going on?  I obviously have an unknown virus or nothing at
all.  This is getting frustrating.  It has occurred a few times on a
couple of computers and I feel I must be getting a panicky
false-reading.  Of course McAfee's lines are continually busy.

Frustrated wants informatin and help, please!

thanks

Subject: Power of the Michelangelo Author (PC)

While the author author of Michelangelo is basking in his sense of
power and influence, I hope that he will consider that he too will
have to pay part of his "tax on computing." He too will suffer from
doubt every time that he puts a new diskette in his system.  He too
will suffer from the effects of an economy that is less efficient than
it would be without him.

Few people will die as a direct result of Michelangelo, but more than
one at the margins of hunger will die as a result of the fact that the
economy is marginally less effective than it would have been without
his contribution.  All the efforts and contributions of his lifetime
are unlikely to erase the damage that he has done.  A pox and a blight
be upon him.

I agree.  I also suspect that we will detect and eliminate far more copies
of other viruses than of Michelangelo.

The sense of urgency generated by Michelangelo's trigger date (I
received calls right up to midnight on the 5th) has resulted in the
purchase, use, and, I hope, permanent installation of a great deal of
anti-virus software.  How many more copies might we have eliminated if
our advice had focused on infected diskettes as much as it did on
infected machines.

Unfortunately, we have not stamped out viruses.  We will have such an
opportunity again.  I suggest that the next time we have the public's
attention, we focus on diskettes.  It is diskettes that hold the majority
of the copies of viruses and it is on dikettes that they are most persistent.

Later in his posting, Joe Abernathy asks for reports of Michelangelo.  I
expect those to be sparse.  (Joe, add Hoyt Limousine of New Canaan to
your list (I got that report as a customer, not as a consultant)).  I
think that the estimates of the number of copies that Michelangelo
achieved in a year were generally exagerated, and the purge more
effective than I would have hoped.  I do not begrudge the bold and brave
entreprenuers that gave us the software their sales.  I think that the
press coverage was at least partially motivated by a spirit of public
service.  But by any count, the security costs of Michelangelo will be
much higher than the cleanup, and mammoth by any measure.

On 4th Feb 1991 a Melbourne suburban PC shop complained that when they
checked a PC they wanted to sell with our program VET, it said that
the Top of Memory was 639K, instead of 640k. We visited the shop, and
found that after we did a DIR on a clean disk the boot sector was no
longer recognisable.  We brought the disk back, analysed it, found
that it was a new virus, and realised that it was timed to overwrite
the hard disk on March 6th.  The virus is thought to have come in on
software from Taiwan, though there is no proof of this. We released a
new version of our program VET which dealt with it on Feb. 5th. A few
days later, when I warned Max Telfer, of the then Chisholm Institute
of Technology, about it, he said "Oh, thats my birthday".  He knew it
was also Michelangelo's birthday, so we named it after him.  I
notified the Australian press, and journalist Charles Wright ran a
story warning about it in the Green Guide (a TV supplement to the
Melbourne Age) on Feb 21st.  I sent a copy, plus description &
commented disassembly, to Dr.  Alan Solomon about the same time.  I
assume this is the copy Chris Fischer received.


              re: Discovery of AntiCAD virus.

                   Note for the record.

Late in May 1990 computers in a lab at Monash University, Vic,
started playing tunes.  On examination they were found to have a
virus which infected both boot sectors and executable files.
Chris Freeman, of Chisholm Institute of Technology (now Monash
Caulfield Campus) was given a copy on May 24th, and after doing
a preliminary analysis gave me a copy on May 29th.  I completed
the analysis, and updated VET to detect the virus in, and remove
it from, both files and boot sectors on floppies & hard disks.
I delivered a copy to Monash on June 1st.

The version found at Monash had the copyright Plastique 5.21.  I
named it AntiCAD, and announced it to the press a few days later.
I sent a copy, description, & commented disassembly to Dr. Alan
Solomon at the same time.

I attended the EICAR Conference in Brussels in mid Sept. 1991, and was
given a disk containing about 100 new viruses, etc. I assume the other
experts present got the same disk. Owing to pressure of work I was not
able to examine the disk till the end of October. On Nov 1st I ran a
file called "Amoeba" from a floppy.  It trashed the floppy & produced
the symptoms described. I did not have time to examine it in detail &
assumed it was a Trojan.  So, despite claims to the contrary in the
Virus Bulletin, this virus had been detected, and specimens of it were
in the hands of European experts, by early September at the latest.

Subject: The cost of Michelangelo (PC)

Twas the night before Michelangelo... <sorry>

Something's been on my mind the last couple days.  Perhaps someone here
can help me.

Does anyone have any idea just how much money has been spent on
this virus, before it's even hit anything?  What I mean is labour costs,
down-time for checking systems over, paying consultants high fees to
run software, lost sales of those companies hit, etc, etc, etc.

I'd figure it's probably in the 8 digits.

It occurs to me that no matter how anti-climax tomorrow might be (and it's
bound to be bad, optimism aside) Mikey has probably caused more trouble
by far than its creator could have hoped for.

Second, somehwat related question.  If this relatively stupid virus
can spread this much this fast, how is it the average super-stealth
virus, many times smarter, doesn't?  Is it a fluke, (dumb question -of
course not) or what?

Subject: Why not Virus protection built in in DOS (a FAQ?) (PC)

With the increasing number of virus and the documented ways of
infection, wouldn't it be possible to have a DOS that would protect
against them?  This is speculation and I would like to know
if some debate already occured about that.

The 80386 has protection against writting in some parts of memory
so that programs not behaviouring normally could be catched.  That is
programs reading system memory that are not DOS nor its components
could be identified and the user advised.

Also, .EXE could have a protection, not just the attribute bit, but if
the DOS has file name with a .EXE, it should identify it as well as
other executable files, as not to be modified file, and advise if some
program try to modify it.

And .EXE, .COM, .SYS, .DLL and other known files could have a checksum
put not after linking, but at linking.  A .OBJ is a set of records
each having a checksum byte, why not having the same feature?

MS and DR are always looking for new reasons to upgrade : an
integrated anti-virus system would be that good reason, no?

Subject: Michelangelo story (PC)

  You may find this entertaining.  I spent most of this afternoon
backing up my hard drive for fear of Michelangelo (actually, I hadn't
backed up my HD in a while).  So it took a while but I got the most
important files diskettes.
  Then I did one final backup: I used a file called BOOTSAFE.EXE which
comes with CPAV.  It backs up your FAT & makes it easier to recover
files from a trashed HD after a virus strikes.  So, I saved the FAT
information file on a diskette.
  Oddly, I decided to check the date on my newly created file.  So, I
ran a 'dir' and looked at the files.  My new file had a creation date
of 03-06-92.  I found this odd since I knew today was only 03-05-92 &
since (I thought) my system date & clock were accurate.
  Suddenly I realized that my date was incorrect because my computer
did not adjust for leap year!  February 29, 1992 must have been
overlooked or something.
  As it turns out, I'm sure I don't have the Michelangelo virus now
because it would have already wiped out my files when I booted up
today.
  I hypothesize that whoever wrote the virus may have known about the
date mixup & hoped to catch people off guard.
  (By the way, I am running DOS 5.0.  I thought it would adjust my
system date for leap years but obviously it doesn't).
  Well, that's the whole story.

Hi, I just started a consulting job at a small college with about 15
PC's.  While hchecking for the Michaelangelo virus with SCANV86B, I
noticed that all of teh computers are infected with No-INT (Stoned)
virus in the partition table.  I'd like to find out more about teh
Stoned virus, but what I really need to know is the following: Will I
either have to (a) SCAN all of the hundreds of diskettes in the office

I'm not Vesselin, but I'll stick my neck out.  :)

Many (most?) file infectors simply reroute the INT 13 call in the
vector table, so they can be found out by an INT 13 monitor.  But
there are several viruses, especially those by "Dark Avenger", which
find the real BIOS INT 13 sub-routine, and don't use the vector table
at all, when they want to access the disk.  These will get past any
effort to monitor INT 13 calls.

Subject: Initial Micelangelo reports (PC)

To all who sent in reports, many thanks.  A brief report on today (and
recent past) sightings:

New Zealand - our two best contacts evidently did their job well, and
had clean shops.  Other areas reported a "detection rate" (in advance
of the deadline) of 10% in some areas.

Japan - MITI had stated earlier in the week that Japan would not be
hit as it didn't use MS-DOS much.  MITI, and seven other companies,
reported hits today.  (MITI only reported one.)

China - announced hits in spite of official claims of "about 10"
reported occurences.

Poland - earlier in the week was reporting detection rates of as high
as 25%

Germany - reported heavily hit by CBC, conspicuous by the absence of
reports from Vesselin.  Too busy?  :-)

South Africa - reported by CBC to have had 1300 hits.

US - New Jersey Institute of Technology reported to have cleaned 2400
of 3000 computers earlier this week (est. cost = $60,000, mine)
   - largest oil company in Houston, and 200 small to mid sized
businesses (est. cost for recovery of computers, assuming backup, $2M,
mine)
   - eastern university reporting a couple of hits

Canada - major metal supplier "tested" for the virus by playing
"Michelangelo roulette" (setting date ahead to Mar. 6) late last
night, lost that machine and cleaned up the rest.  Two Baptist
churches reported hit in the Vancouver area.  Local school board found
a copy on one machine, tested on old machine, did not trigger, figured
Mikey was a hoax.  (Any bets the test machine was a really old XT?
Wonder if they got hit and are now lying low.)  UofA reports one hit
(good work, Tim), NRC reports four disks cleaned.

In other news:

McAfee is quoted as saying clocks on machines that triggered on
Thursday (a fair number of reports of that) were set ahead by
"accident".  No one is reporting the significance of the leap year.

A number of reports of users palying Michelangelo roulette, including
one that lost a full 170M hard disk (170 "shelf feet" of printout,
gone).  Another found the virus, tried to disassemble it with DEBUG,
and triggered it.

A number of reports of CLEAN and the NAV Special Edition "damaging"
disks and partitions.  No report of the fact that NAV Special does not
check for any other virus.  (CPAVSE checks for some "Friday the 13th"
families, at least.)

Very few reports of the upcoming Thursday the 12th, Friday the 13th,
Saturday the 14th, Maltese Amoeba next week.

Sorry for typoes and terse style, trying to keep up and get reports
out at the same time.

I've looked at this software, and YES, there is a worry about viruses.
The software emulates almost all of a 286's instruction set, and does
seem to execute the boot sector of the C: "disk" (which is actually a
file, containing all the sectors that normally occur on a PC's hard
disk).  The question as to whether it executes the MBR is up to the
writer of the emulator, so maybe other PC emulators don't do this (I
know of at least two for Suns, and several for other computers like
AViiON's, plus various releases with differences).

So boot sector viruses are a worry; the viryual hard disk can get
infected just as easily as on a real PC, but (unlike virtual hard
disks under PC-NFS, DECNET DOS/PCSA, etc) such infections can probably
be serious (i.e. they can spread from there when you run the PC
emulator, and can deliver the payload of the virus - e.g. wipe most of
the virtual C: disk in the case of the March 6th virus).

But, you are correct in saying there will be limitations with
accessing files on the Unix system.  You can have two types of file -
one on the virtual hard disks that only DOS accesses normally, plus
files under Unix, which are very similar to network files.  If a virus
can't corrupt networked files (not all are able to) then it probably
can't corrupt files in your normal Unix directories.  And the question
of permissions - most people will have their own files able to be
written to by themselves, so they could very well be affected.  And
then there is something about running the emulator under root - I
can't remember the details now, but I think it was suggested as an
option in the instructions - that could be disasterous, since viruses
that are only partially compatible could make a mess of things.
However, I didn't go into that fully enough when I was testing the
software, so there's soem experimentation there for somebody.

> using virus-infected disks that they were infected, but hadn't harmed
> the system?

I have to admit that I was too scared to try it, but I'm pretty sure
that most BSI viruses and a few file infectors would have no problems
with the C: drive.

I think I tried a simple scanner. I expect some software would try
scanning *too many* files, and quite possibly have difficulty, e.g.
F-PROT when it scans all hard disks might take too long, but probably
won't find .EXE or .COM files that are too odd.  But if there is a
similar system on VAXen, then files with those extensions could seem
very odd to virus scanners.  I sometimes use DEC's TFA (Transparent
File Access), where such files could be found on the VAX, but aren't
automatically scanned by F-PROT, thankfully.

Unfortunately I dropped the idea, mainly because the performance was
poor (took most of the CPU, poor display, poor mouse interaction, poor
emulation), but I have heard that newer versions (with idle detection)
are better.

COMPUTER USERS SCRAMBLE TO SABOTAGE Michelangelo,
Deadly Virus Set to Wreak Havoc Tomorrow

By John Burgess and Sandra Sugawara, Washington Post Staff Writers.

   Panicky computer users all over the Washington area scrambling to
protect their machines before a highly destructive computer "virus"
known as Michelangelo strikes tomorrow.
   Local software stores reported yesterday that they were selling out
of special programs that detect and remove the virus.  Callers were
swamping hot lines .....
   The virus has been found and removed in ... the National Institutes
of Health. ....
   John McAfee, chairman of the Computer Virus Industry Association,
said that his group has been receiving more than 100 reports of
Michelangelo infects a day from around the world.
   Emergency inspections have shown that the vast majority of machines
do not carry the virus -- only three of 7,000 machines at the House of
Representatives have been found to be infected, for instance. ....
   "I"m having to send out an army of personnel," said Craig Pritcher,
director of office technology at accounting firm Ernst & Young, which
has about 200 personal computers in its Washington offices.
[But, what did he find after checking the PCs ??]
   FBI chief William Sessions yesterday [end of page A1,start page A28]
issued an alert about Michelangelo .... [Has any one seen this alert ?
I fell better, now that the FBI is after Michelangelo too  :-)  ].
   Outside the D.C. area, the virus has been detected at such far-flung
locations as the New Jersey Institute of Technology, a Miami office of
the Justice Department and the Department of Energy's Sandia National
Laboratory in New Mexico. ....
   Experts say it is unclear how prevalent the Michelangelo virus is
compared with other strains. ....
   Neil Schubert, direct of systems for Ramada Renaissance hotel on the
East Coast, became concerned after reading media accounts.  Yesterday
morning, after obtaining anti-virus software, he checked 40 machines
[he said "40 plus" on TV tonight. D. Bridge] on the chain's hotel on
Ninth Street NW [Washington, DC].  One ... was found to contain the
virus. ....
   Several computer managers said that Michelangelo scare is having the
positive effect of focusing attention on an issue that many have not
taken seriously. ....
   Tony Kaculis, director of information systems and technology for the
Washington law firm Steptoe & Johnson, ...scan[ed] each of the firm's
500 PCs.  They found no cases of Michelangelo, but the sweep turned up
eight computers infected with another virus.
   Potomac Electric Power Co. has directed its employees to check the
company's 900 PCs carefully.  So far, six cases of the Michelangelo
virus have been reported to Kenneth Cohn, Pepco's manager of computer
services. ....

MICHELANGELO VIRUS STRIKES SOME COMPUTERS A DAY EARLY
By John Burgess, Washington Post Staff Writer

   The Michelangelo computer virus struck a day early yesterday [=March
6th] and destroyed data in at least three Washington [DC] area computers,
computers, according to several computer security specialists.
   In each case, they said, the data were lost because the machine's
internal calendar incorrectly told the computer that yesterday was March
6, ....
   In addition, computer security expert John McAfee said he had received
a small number of reports of the virus activating in other U.S. cities,
as well as in Hong Kong and Australia, ....
   In Okinawa, Japan, the virus activated in three of 20 computers at a
small architectural firm and destroyed data, primarily architectural
diagrams, according to security specialists.  Damage was estimated at
$10,000-$20,000.
   [more stuff deleted]
   Yesterday, Commcrypt Inc., a Beltsville [Maryland] computer security
firm, reported that two of its clients had lost data to the virus.
Sela Consultants Corp. of North Potomac [Maryland] reported that one
client had been hit.  Both companies declined to identify the victims.

MICHELANGELO PC VIRUS WASN'T QUITE AN EPIDEMIC
By John Burgess and Sandra Sugawara, Washington Post Staff Writers

   The 517th birthday of Michelangelo came and went yesterday and the
computer world survived.
   ... But yesterday it struck only a smattering of homes and businesses
in the Unites States and foreign countries.
   Computer specialists credited the relatively light damage to
heavy-duty publicity about its ability to wipe out all the data stored
on a computer.
   Many analysts suggested that the publicity had instilled a healthy
fear in millions of computer users who had paid no attention to viruses.
   [stuff deleted]
   Virus expert John McAfee said that most activations in the United
States occurred at small businesses, generally disabling one or two
machines per location.  He estimated that about 1,000 companies were
hit, which would be only a fraction of the roughly 47 million machines
in the country.
   [stuff deleted]
   At Cetrom Consulting Engineering Inc., a small firm in Gaithersburg,
[Maryland] office manager Ruth Poulin this morning routinely switched on
the firm's two computers and was shocked to see that within minutes all
the data stored on them had been obliterated -- payroll accounts,
contracts, letters, several software programs. [stuff deleted]
   Elsewhere in the area, the University of Maryland reported three
cases [end of page C1/start page C6] of machines crashing, apparently
due to the virus.  Kaplan Sutton & Associates, a small firm in Columbia,
Md., said its one computer had been hit as well.
   News agencies and computer experts reported scattered incidents of
the virus hitting in Germany, Britain, Egypt, China, Japan and
Australia.  News reports said South Africa, where publicity of the
virus's danger was relative low, had an unusually high number of
activations.
   Among the institutions that removed the virus in time were the House
of Representatives, Potomac Electric Power Co., the Central Intelligence
Agency and Bell Atlantic Corp.
   Staff writers Liz Spayd and Charles Hall contributed to this report.
