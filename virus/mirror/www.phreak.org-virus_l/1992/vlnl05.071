Exactly: we stop on finding the first virus in a file.  Seems no point
to continue scanning: if we have a disinfector enabled and you disinfect
the file we'll continue scanning after removing the first virus.

About 80% of our scan strings we've derived ourselves.  The remaining
20% come from the Virus Bulletin.  I've no idea where McAfee
Associates gleans their strings from.

We do a minor encoding of our string table, and remove the memory table
when we complete.  You discovered one of our "gee, we'll fix it next
release" holes.

Subject: Michaelangelo & Noint (PC)

I noticed that when I scanned a MICH infected diskette with SCANV86B
that it reported reported the NOINT, The diskette was re-scanned using
V84 and sure enough the MICHAELANGELO was reported.  I recall that on
the week of Mar 02 there were numerous NOINT reports, but few
MICHAELANGELO's being found.  II tested a NOINT sample with V84, but
it is reported as a STONED related virus.

I wonder if the NOINT reports were really NOINT or MICHEALANGELO?
Anyone notice a sudden surge in NOINT reports?

Subject: FDISK /MBR (PC)

My experiments with FDISK/MBR seem to indicate that if you are
starting with a completely non-sense MBR, then FDISK /MBR will
*not* be able to create an MBR which is useable without further
editing.

For example, I filled the entire MBR of a Compaq 386 with
the letter 'E' (045h), then booted from a DOS5 diskette, then
ran FDISK/MBR, then tried to boot from the fixed disk.
No siree.

The Partition Table starts at offset 01BEh in the MBR.  I believe
that if this area contains reasonable values, then FDISK /MBR will
*leave them intact* when it re-builds the MBR, and the MBR *will*
then be usable.

Michelangelo, when infecting a fixed disk's MBR, appears to leave
the PT area of the MBR alone.  This would explain why FDISK /MBR
is able to rid the fixed disk of the virus *and* "restore" the
original partitions (I put "restore" in quotes because they were
never really modified).

Just because *Michelangelo* leaves the PT in the MBR alone,
doesn't mean *all* boot-sector viruses are so obliging.  As
discussed above, it would seem that FDISK/MBR would *not*
successfully bring back a fixed disk whose MBR had been infected
with a boot-sector virus which overwrites the PT.  So the advice
being given on comp.virus about using FDISK/MBR should carry some
kind caveat to this effect.

Also, I first learned about FDISK /MBR by talking to the folks at
Microsoft tech support.  I was upgrading to MS-DOS5 from a PC
with a fixed disk partitioned and formatted under Compaq DOS3.31.
After installing MS-DOS5 and trying to run SMARTDRV.SYS, I kept
getting an annoying message about my partition not being compatible
or something.  MS told me to run FDISK/MBR to fix it.  It worked.

am i to understand that this will work on all previous DOS versions?
i'm going to assume that it is correct for 3.xx and up. i know that

In the more modern PC Bios's (AMI etc) there is a cmos parameter which
says in which order the computer will boot either A: first and then if
A: does not have a drive in it, then boot from C:. It is possible to
reverse this, so that the system boots from C: first then, if there is
no bootable Hard Disk it will then boot from A:.

Thus If you change the boot order parameter your system will boot from
the hard disk (if there is one).

I would like to ask a question to all of you who know a little more
about a virus than I (which doesn't take much).  There was a message
on a computer in my office lately that puzzled me.  I've heard a lot
about different things that a virus will do, but not this.

When turning this computer on, a message like follows appears on
occasion.

       ok        IBM

      (the ok has a circle around it and is crossed out like a no smoking sign)

This only happens every now and then.  Does anyone have any ideas what
this could be?  To my knowledge, we were not hit by Michaelangelo.

Thanks

	When I run chkdsk on several pc it is reporting 654336 total
memory instead of the 655... that it is usually reporting. I then
decided to run scan version 86 on those pc from a clean floppy and it

   Yikes! Is that quote really attributable to Peter Norton?  If so, does
   anyone know where, when, or in what context he said it?

I could believe it.  Last summer I claimed to have never seen a PC
virus (except ones I had written myself).  Only about three weeks
later someone's PC here contracted Dark Avenger.

If you are not in a "high risk" category there is good chance you may
not run into a virus.  At least until recently.

I dislike the shareware concept and prefer playing with things that I
have the source code for.  I actually pay money for things like
Borland C and Quattro.  Finding viruses in major commercial software
and source code is still relatively rare.

   Unfortunately, it is dangerous to put a gun in the hands of a child, as

Trivial statement but wrong.  Encrypted viruses with changing
encryption keys are nothing new.  The "mutating engine" described in
this group sounds like a more sophisticated technique.  These things
do change themselves and can render virus scanners obsolete.  People
should wake up that scanners are not a very good way to prevent
viruses.

   trivial statement, it is important.  This is why a program scans for
   'variants' of viruses, and one reason that updates are so frequent is
   because people have nothing better to do with their time than change
   virus code to make its 'signature' different.

Frequent updates to signature files can be convenient if you are in
the virus scanner busniness.

I am looking for information on the ibm PC 'polymorph' virus, which is
self-encrypting, self mutating, and overwrites random sectors on the

virus is to notice an unexplained growth in COM files.

Has anyone heard of this virus? Is it true that there are currently no
means of detecting it other than mentioned above? If this isn't true,
how would I go about detecting such a virus?

In my opinion the best program (also for use at startup of the PC) is
SCAN from McAfee. It is a rather easy to use commandline program which
even returns DOS errorcodes (useful in Batch files).

The last version (as far as I'm informed) is SCANV86B.

It is shareware and available via Internet and bitnet.

Best thing is to FTP to your neareset FTP-srever with and try to find it.
My preferred source is WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL [192.88.110.20] and all
it's mirrors as well as the TRICKLEs.

Installation instructions are in the .ZIP (or whatever archiver the
server uses).

That would seem to be a bit extreme.  It is perfectly safe to "scan"
for viral programs on any uninfected machine, and I am assuming that
you are worried about infecting your own machine from new uploads,
rather than infecting the new uploads from an infection that is
already running on your system.

A viral program cannot infect you until you run it.  Thus, until you
run any of the new programs, you are not at risk from them.  (By the
way, do you have Fidonet access?  I recently answered a similar
question on the VIRUS_INFO echo.)

>BBSes that scan the upload automatically as soon as it is recieved.

Actually, it's a dumber practice than it sounds.  I support a number
of the larger local bulletin boards, and have tried to break the
sysops of this practice, particularly where antiviral software is
concerned.

One of the factors involved is the false sense of security this
creates.  Sysops seem to think that this one factor precludes testing
of the software itself.  We had a situation recently where a BBS
(which used an automatic scanning program) posted, and promoted, the
latest version of SCAN, SCAN 87.  Trouble was, McAfee Associates
hadn't made SCAN 87 yet: the thing was a trojan.  (Following usual
practice in such cases, I understand the next version will be 89.)

A second factor is that some of the "unzip and SCAN" programs will
only use the McAfee and PKWare products.  A third is that some the the
programs insist on "rezipping" archives, destroying what little
security the "security envelopes" provide.

>Is that safe?  Wouldn't the virus be able to infect the BBS program if
>one is detected.  Depending on the type of virus of course.

I seem to recall, in the dim and distant recesses of my memory, either
a trojan or a virus which did test for the presence of BBS software.
However, even if I do recall correctly, these types of programs are
extremely rare.

Hello All,
          I *think* that we have a new virus on one of our Lab PC's.
The machine in question is an old Opus running Dos 3.3 and the
students (read cockroaches) using it are mostly using GW-Basic and
their own programs.

Once the machine has been on for a while (typically 5-6 hours) it
while either start playing some unknown tune, or produce a *firework*
type display using the asterisk character.

No damage seems to have been done to data or programs, the system is
just as slow as it ever was, and NONE of the anti-viral packages that
we have can detect anything at all.  I have been running Jim Bates'
VISCHECK for about two weeks now and this tells me that none of the
.EXE or .COM files have changed in any way.

The HD boot sector is clean, and the only thing loaded at startup
(apart from command.com) is the keyboard driver.

This is driving me CRAZY :-(

Anyone out there come across this kind of activity before ??

:
:   Oh,no!
:   But answer is simple: virus writing started with wide PC using and
: anti-virus writing started when people recognized couple of viruses on
: their PC's.

The very first virus that I ever saw or heard of was the SCA
(Scandinavian Cracking Association) virus for the Commodore Amiga.
Obviously inspired by the film 2010 approx 4-5 years ago and all in <
1k.

Can someone confirm or deny if this was indeed the one that started it
all.

Something wonderful has happened....

Your Amiga is Alive....

And even better....

Some of your disks have been infected....

By a VIRUS !!!!

Subject: Mac anti-viral site no longer available (Mac)

The Macintosh anti-viral distribution site at SCFVM.GSFC.NASA.GOV is
no longer available. Budgetary constraints required us to remove the
operating system which supported the server. Sorry, all.
