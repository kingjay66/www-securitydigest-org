Subject: WARNING - new viruses, Monkey.1 and Monkey.2 (PC)

Virus Name:  MONKEY.1, MONKEY.2  (Empire variants)
V Status:    New
Discovery:   February, 1992
Symptoms:    Memory reduction, hard drive partitions not accessible on
             floppy bootup.
Origin:      Alberta, Canada
Eff. Length: 512 bytes
Type Code:   BPRtS (Boot and Partition table infector - Resident TOM -
             Stealth)
Detection:   CHKDSK, F-PROT 2.04, CHKSEC from Disk Secure 1.15, KILLMONK
Removal:     Cold boot from clean, write-protected floppy, replace MBR (hard
             disk) or Boot Sector (floppy).

General Comments:
The Monkey viruses are Main Boot Record / Boot Sector infectors,
derived from the Empire D virus.  Two variants of the Monkey virus
have been identified: their most obvious difference is in the initial
bytes at offset 0:
Monkey.1:    E9 CD 01      (JMP 02D0)
Monkey.2:    EB 1E 90      (JMP 0020 ; NOP)

Both variants keep the original sector's data at offset 03h - 1fh.  In
boot sectors, this region contains data required to identify the
diskette format.  This solves the problem noticed with earlier
variants of Empire, whereby infected 720k diskettes were sometimes
unreadable.

The Monkey viruses take 1k from the top of memory.  When active, total
memory will be reduced by 1024 bytes.

The Monkey viruses use stealth to protect both the MBR and diskette
boot sectors.  When active in memory, Int 13h calls cannot access the
infected sector of either hard disks or floppies.

The Monkey viruses are not polimorphic.  They do not encode any of the
virus, as was done by some of the earlier Empire variants.  But before
saving the clean MBR or boot sector to a hiding place, the Monkey
viruses do encode that sector, using an "XOR 2Eh".  This creates a
problem for any disinfecting program that recover the initial boot
sector or MBR by copying it from the hiding place.

When a hard disk is infected, the encoded MBR is put at side 0,
cylinder 0, sector 3.

When a floppy diskette is infected, the original boot sector is placed
in the bottom sector of the root directory.  This means directory
entries will be lost only if the root directory is nearly full -- more
than 96 entries on double density diskettes, or more than 208 entries
on high density diskettes.  The virus is designed to identify only the
four most common diskette formats.  If the diskette is not of a
recognized format, the boot sector is put on side 1, sector 3.  I have
no idea what would happen to a 2.88Mb diskette, but I suspect the
virus would damage the File Allocation Table, causing loss of data.

The Monkey viruses do not put any messages to the screen at any time,
but the virus code does contain, encrypted, the string "Monkey",
followed by bytes 1992h.  It may be significant that the chinese Year
of the Monkey began in February 1992.

The most remarkable characteristic of the Monkey viruses is that they
were designed as an attack on Padgett Peterson's "Disk Secure"
product.  When a computer is booted from an infected diskette, the
virus first checks whether Disk Secure is on the hard disk.  If it is,
the virus puts itself in sector 2, rather than sector 1, and slightly
modifies Disk Secure, so that Disk Secure will load the virus after
Disk Secure has checked the system and loaded itself.  The monkey
viruses install themselves and above Disk Secure, in memory, at offset
200h.

The Monkey viruses do not save the partition table data in place, so
if an infected system is booted from a clean boot disk, DOS claims to
be unable to access the hard drive partitions.  A DIR C: command will
return "Invalid drive specification".

Detection:
Of the popular virus scanning products, only F-PROT 2.04 finds the
Monkey viruses, calling them a "New variant of stoned".  It will
identify the virus in memory as well.  The F-PROT Virstop driver does
not recognise the Monkey viruses, on boot-up.

Disk Secure v. 1.15a (ds115a.zip) has a version of CHKSEC that will
notice the presence of the Monkey viruses.  Notice that Disk Secure
itself will not detect the infection: it is important that the CHKSEC
command be called from the autoexec.bat file.

The simplest detection still involves recognizing a 1k decrease in
memory.  CHKDSK and MEM will return 1k less "total conventional
memory" than normal.

A special program to find and remove the Monkey viruses, called
KILLMONK, has been written at the University of Alberta.  I hope to
make this available to the anti-virus community shortly.

Removal:
The undocumented /MBR option of FDISK does remove the Monkey virus
from the MBR, provided the computer was booted from a clean floppy,
but it does not restore the correct partition table values.  The
problem is that the partition table is not in place in sector one: the
table is encoded, in sector 3.

To clean a hard disk: If you have previously saved a copy of the clean
MBR, then this can be restored.  (Many anti-virus products have an
automated way of doing this.)  If you don't have a copy of the
original MBR, and don't know what values your partition table should
have, then the KILLMONK program may be what you need.

To restore diskettes: Padgett Peterson's FIXFBR works very well,
though it doesn't recognize that the disk is infected.  Another
alternative is the KILLMONK program.

Scan String:
The following hexidecimal string is in both variants of Monkey.  It is
from the code the virus uses to recognize itself.
   26 81 bf fa 01 19 92 c3 26 81 bf 19 01 50 61

Subject: WARNING - Virus Creation Laboratory (PC)

I have acquired a rather disturbing new software package, that is
apparently available from some of the virus BBSes.  It is called the
"Virus Creation Laboratory" v 1.00, (c) 1992 Nowhere Man and [NuKE]
WaReZ.  The package includes the V.C.L. itself, a development
environment written in Borland C++ and styled after the Borland
Integrated Development Environment, MS-Windows .ico and .pif files,
surprisingly well written documentation, and eight example viruses and
trojans.

The VCL makes virus writing a matter of picking options from pull-down
menus.  Infection type, encryption, etc., can be selected, and a large
range of nasty effects and conditions can also be selected.  The
package will create MASM-compatible assembler code, and if an
assembler is available will optionally create an executable .com file.
The package can make *.com infecting viruses, companion viruses,
trojans, and time-bomb object files for linking into software
projects.

The disturbing thing is that with this package any beginning DOS user
can create working viruses.  This kind of a virus development package
was predicted by Vesselin and others some months ago, when the MtE
first showed up.  In fact it isn't the first attempt at such a
package, I gather (from the documentation), but it is (to my
knowledge) the most "user-friendly".

Fortunately the viruses created by VCL v1.00 are pretty simple
viruses.  The package cannot create viruses that stay in memory, and
cannot create *.exe infectors.  The encryption options are rather
simple, not nearly as complex as the MtE encryption routines.
Unfortunately Nowhere Man hopes to improve future releases of the
software, adding *.exe infecting abilities, better encryption, and TSR
ability.

Of the eight demo viruses included in the package, F-PROT 2.04
suspects three of being variants of Vienna.  Using the heuristics
option, F-PROT identifies 7 of the 8 as being suspect.  Scan v93
doesn't identify any of the programs as viruses.

I suspect it will not be hard for the writers of scanners to find
search strings and algorithms to identify all viruses made by VCL.  It
took about 10 minutes, with DEBUG, using carefully chosen
"unassemble", "go", "trace" and "search" commands, to find the ascii
code for all the assembler code output the VCL uses.

It is interesting to note that Nowhere Man has the gaul to expressly
forbid any disassembly of his code, or the use of any binary strings
produced by his program for the purposes of scanning for viruses
created by the package.  Yah, right, Nowhere Man.  Go ahead, sue me.

I'm having a hard time trying to locate what VSUM calls 1575-D, the
one variant of 1575 which is supposed to show a green caterpillar on
the screen.  I have the following files from various libraries:

NCSA:
!1892.COM (a,1) !4404.COM (b,2) !4405.COM (c,3) !4914.COM (a,1)
!1553.EXE (c,1) !4403.EXE (b,2) !2421.EXE (b,2) !4914.EXE (a,1)
!3314.EXE (b,2) !5646.EXE (c,1)
CERTUS:
!6585CRT.EXE (c,3)      !7345CRT.EXE (b,2)      !6584CRT.COM (c,1)
!7344CRT.COM (b,2)      !7346CRT.COM (c,3)      !7347CRT.COM (a,1)
!7348CRT.COM (a,1)      !7349CRT.COM (a,1)      !7350CRT.COM (b,2)
AVPD:
_1575_B.EXE (b,2)

The (a,1), etc. are the Green Caterpillar variant names from Solomon
and F-Prot.  None are d or 4, unfortunately.

Could someone who knows the various library collections please tell me
which of these samples or any other samples in which libraries
correspond to the VSUM 1575-D variant?

Also, which samples in which libraries correspond to "Loa Duong" and
the "Slayer" family?

Thanks.

McAfee was quoted in Australia recently as saying that he didn't
recommend using virus cleaning utilities by anyone except those without
back-ups.

The reason he said this is that such cleaning utilities are not 100%
effective and can damage code or leave it infected.  One is better to
identify the infected files, wipe them and restore from back-up.  As
for those who don't maintain effective back-ups, maybe there is a
Santa Claus, Virginia.

Generic detection is the way to go if what we are talking about is the
ability to detect --all-- viruses known and unknown.  This is the major
weakness of scanners - they can't identify viruses they don't already
know about.

Subject: a report on a viral infection (PC)

Report on a viral infection

1.

On Dec.11, 1991, I was informed that a *.com file, which I
had sent to someone, did contain the cascade virus.

Immediate check with the then most recent version of scan
reported the presence of [1701] in about 15 recently used
*.com files on the PC.

Inspection of the commentaries for the files in TROJAN-PRO
of SIMTEL suggested that the program "dvir1701.exe" would
remove the virus and heal the files. Consequently,
"dvir1701.exe" was applied, and the affected *.com files
were restored to their original sizes. They now all bore the
date of 11.12.91 and the same time.

2.

Since then, the PC in question ran without trouble. Whenever
new software was tested, it was subjected to scan before,
and no infections were noticed.

On the morning of June 28, the PC crashed after a batch file
had been run, loading fonts into a printer, immediately
after booting. During the crash, there appeared "110  / ?????"
on the screen.

The PC, an old PS2/80, is operated with a complicated memory
management. It thus was suspected that a mixup had occurred
during the cache management, and the PC was rebooted from a
floppy (older than 11.12.92), containing the same
configuration. Then autoexec.bat was loaded into an editor
and several lines, which might have been the cause for the
crash, were commented out. When the save command of the
editor was given, the machine crashed again.

An attempt to reboot the machine did fail. When the machine
was rebooted from the original (write protected) DOS boot
floppy, it turned out that several filenames on drive c: had
changed, loosing characters. Also, autoexec.bat had
disappeared. Upon these observations, it was concluded that
a virus might be present, and the then latest version of
scan, 91, was gotten from a SIMTEL mirror.

Scan91 reported [170X] in memory, but did not report any
affected files. It also reported the FAT of c: to be
incorrect.

Clean91 cleared the memory. Inspection of FAT with help of
Norton Utilities showed at least one glaring error,

    216 217 218 4059 EOF 221 ...

while the highest block number on c: was 485 . It was
guessed that the correct entry should read 219, and when
this was entered manually, the FAT was reported to be
correct.

Still, the machine did not boot from c: , and it was
concluded that the boot sector was affected.

Inspection of the commentaries for the files in TROJAN-PRO
of SIMTEL suggested that the program "m-disk.zip" might
clean the boot sector.  As the machine runs DOS 3.3 ,
"md33.exe" was tried. It did restore the boot sector, and
the machine now would boot from c: .

After booting in this way, Scan91 again would report [170X]
in memory. Checking one by one the files called from
autoexec.bat, it turned out that

(1) several of them were healed *.com files from 11.12.91
    (e.g. a tiny file, written by myself, putting NC on F2,
    and another one removing the numerical lock)

(2) whenever the PC was floppy-booted (and Scan91 then
    reported no virus in memory) and then one of the
    supposedly healed *.com files was run, Scan91 again
    reported [170X] in memory.

Upon this observation, all healed *.com files from 11.12.91
were removed and replaced by either original versions or
newly written ones.

Subject: Methods of Virus Defense [Part 2-- Clean Boot Disks]

Why have a bootable floppy handy?  There are lots of reasons-- not all
of them virus related!

What do you do if something goes wrong with your hard disk?  This
could range from a disastrous hardware failure to an incorrect command
in the CONFIG.SYS file.  If the hard disk won't boot, you'll still
need to access it, either to recover whatever you can or to fix your
typos.

Ideally, Microsoft or IBM would ship clean, write-protected bootable
floppies with every system.  These would be produced from a computer
that had never seen any software, except software taken directly from
its programmers.  Unfortunately, we do not live in an ideal world, so
we have to make do with next-best.

Given these limitations, there are two real choices:
  + You boot from your original DOS disk, and hope that it wasn't infected
    at the factory.  Then make your "clean" floppy.
  + You hope that your computer isn't infected and go ahead and make a
    bootable floppy.  You can check your boot sector with DEBUG to see if
    a non-stealth boot infector is present.

As you can see, neither method completely assures that no viruses are
present.  The first method is about as close as you can get, tho.

If you KNOW that you are infected, and want to make a floppy that at
least has a chance of being clean, you might try a program like
Teledisk, which saves an image of a disk to a file, and vice versa.
You could ask someone with Teledisk to copy their clean floppy to a
file and send it to you.  I have not tested this under "battle"
conditions, but it is possible that a boot sector virus could copy
itself to the disk immediately after the file-->disk conversion.  DO
NOT change to the disk (i.e. type "A:") until you have write-
protected it!  This would almost certainly spread the infection to the
disk.

Another possibility is "patching" the boot sector with a clean boot
sector, using only BIOS calls.  Norton's DISKEDIT can do this.  (I
think).  Note that BIOS calls can possibly be intercepted, too.  A
good stealth virus may have you writing to somewhere else on the disk.
The same caution about changing to the disk applies.

These are both acts of desperation, and may not be effective.  A
better bet would be to create a boot floppy on a different computer,
preferably one that has a small chance of being infected.  (Any
computer without active virus protection is suspect.)

How to create a clean bootable floppy:
  + Cold boot from your DOS disk, if you have one.
  + Run your virus scanner with a memory check.  This should catch any
    known boot sector viruses.
  + If it finds nothing, format your floppy and SYS it.  Don't forget to
    copy COMMAND.COM.  (Preferably from your original DOS installation
    disks.)
  + Copy PKunzip (original compressed archive PKZ110.EXE) onto your floppy.
  + Copy F-prot (original .ZIP file) onto your floppy.
  + Cold boot from your new floppy.  (Don't write protect it yet.)
  + Uncompress PKunzip and F-prot.  Delete the compressed files.
  + Write protect your new floppy.

The reason you copy everything from the original archives is to
minimize the possibility of file infectors attaching to your antivirus
software.  If you're really concerned, use VALIDATE from McAffee or
another CRC checking program to be more certain.

Validate codes: (VALIDATE 0.3)
  + DOS 5.00 COMMAND.COM
    47,845 bytes
    Method 1: 77B1 Method 2: 1196
  + PKZ110.EXE
    85,724 bytes
    Method 1: 962D Method 2: 0D8F
  + FP-204A.ZIP
    269,411 bytes
    Method 1: 0AF5 Method 2: 175A

Be careful when creating AUTOEXEC files that you do not execute ANY
programs from your hard disk.  This kinda defeats the purpose of the
clean floppy, since these programs could be infected.  Accessing data
files on the hard disk should be OK.  (For example, stacked drives.
Be sure to copy STACKER.COM onto the floppy, DO NOT use the copy on
the hard disk.)

I also find it useful to keep a clean boot floppy with nothing but
COMMAND.COM on it.  This is used not so much for anti-virus activities
as it is for checking for software incompatibilites.  Whenever
something bizarre happens, like a new program refuses to load, I start
from this disk to eliminate the possibility of TSRs interfering with
one another.  If the program starts after rebooting, it is probably a
software conflict.

Other programs that may be useful on your floppy:
  + A text editor for viewing F-prot's documentation.
  + Device drivers that you NEED to have.  (STACKER.COM if you want to scan
    your stacked drives, required video/hard disk drivers, etc.)
  + DEBUG and/or Norton's DISKEDIT.

Things you should NOT have on your floppy:
   + A PATH statement that includes ANY hard drive letters.  (DO NOT put
     PATH=C:\DOS in your AUTOEXEC!)
   + Batch files in your path that access the hard drive.  This includes
     DOSKEY aliases, etc.  I would advise anyone just to skip the path
     statement altogether on your floppy.

Wishing your computer the best of health,

                   The "Jerusalem" virus - part 1

In the MS-DOS world the Stoned virus is currently the most successful
virus in terms of the number of infections (copies or reproductions)
that the virus has produced.  (Boot sector viral programs seem to
have an advantage among microcomputer users.)  Among file infecting
viral programs, however, the Jerusalem virus is the clear winner.  It
has another claim to fame as well.  It almost certainly has the
largest number of variants of any virus program known to date.

Initially known as the "Israeli" virus, the version reported by Y.
Radai in early 1988 (also sometimes referred to as "1813" or
Jerusalem-B) tends to be seen as the "central" virus in the family.
Although it was the first to be very widely disseminated, and was the
first to be "discovered" and publicized, internal examination
suggests that it was, itself, the outcome of previous viral
experiments.  Although one of the oldest viral programs, the
Jerusalem family still defies description, primarily because the
number of variants makes it very difficult to say anything about the
virus for sure.  The "Jerusalem" that you have may not be the same as
the "Jerusalem" of your neighbour.

A few things are common to pretty much all of the Jerusalem family.
They are file, or program, infecting viri, generally adding
themselves to both COM and EXE files.  When an infected file is
executed, the virus "goes resident" in memory, so that it remains
active even after the original infected program is terminated.
Programs run after the program is resident in memory are infected by
addition of the virus code to the end of the file, with a redirecting
jump added to the beginning of the program.  Most of the family carry
some kind of "date" logic bomb payload, often triggered on Friday the
13th.  Sometimes the logic bomb is simply a message, often it deletes
programs as they are invoked.

David Chess has noted that it is a minor wonder the program has
spread as far as it has, given the number of bugs it contains.
Although it tends to work well with COM files, the differing
structure of EXE files has presented Jerusalem with a number of
problems.  The "original Jerusalem", not content with one infection,
will "reinfect" EXE files again and again so that they continually
grow in size.  (This tends to nullify the advantage that the
programmer built in when he ensured that the file creation date was
"conserved" and unchanged in an infected file.)  Also, EXE programs
which use internal loaders or overlay files tend to be infected "in
the wrong place", and have portions of the original program
overwritten.
