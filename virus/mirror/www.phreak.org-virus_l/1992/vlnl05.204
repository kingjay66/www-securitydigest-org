Yes, the standard Jerusalem (huh? what standard? Well, I mean
Jerusalem.1808.Standard <grin>) always crashes the network, because of
some conflicts between the undocumented DOS function calls that it
installs and uses for "Are you there?" questions and memory
installation. At least, it has always crashed in our tests. There are
variants of it that are using other undocumented function calls, that
do not cause a conflict.

It is a security problem, indeed, and a major one. Checking only the
entry point of the files is -very- insecure, because it is possible to
infect a file, without modifying any of the following: size, date,
time, attributes, entry point.

However, I was thinking about other security problems. TbCheck uses a
CRC with a fixed generator, and this can be easily subverted. It
doesn't know about PATH companions. It doesn't know about the DOS file
fragmentation attack. And so on...

I would strongly suggest to any aspiring authors of integrity checking
packages to take a careful look at my paper "Possible Attacks Against
Integrity Checking Programs And How to Prevent Them". The paper has
been published in the proceedings of the 2nd International Anti-Virus
Conference, organized by Virus Bulletin, September 1992, in Edinburgh.
An improved version of the paper has been published in the proceedings
of the 2nd EICAR conference in Munich, December 1992. The improved
version of the paper is available for anonymous ftp from our site as

ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de:/pub/virus/texts/viruses/attacks.zip

The archive contains the paper in both LaTeX and ASCII format.

I can think about at least two - LeapFrog and Emmie. The point is that
it -is- possible to do it, there -are- viruses that are doing it,
therefore, the integrity checkers -must- take into account this
possibility.

I'm afraid that I do not understand the question... There's nothing
special with Armagedon - it just prepends itself to the COM files -
like the Jerusalem virus does...

We've had three instances of the same problem here. In two cases FDISK
/MBR corrected the problem with no adverse side-effects. The user in
the third case is reluctant to run FDISK on a DOS 3.0 machine.
 
Anyone know what'll happen if we do that?

Stoned + Michelangelo (original MBR lost), what else did anybody expect?

I wonder why we saw so diverging responses to this poster. Do the
experts not bother to read the FAQ list? I assure you, reading it is
worth-while!  I do not say so because I am acknowledged in its preface
(my contribution was rather limited), but because knowing what's in
the FAQ list could save many VIRUS-L subscribers -- both novices and
experienced virus busters -- a lot of work, honestly!

Subject: Will the real MS-DOS 5.00 please stand up (PC)

        The recent CHKDSK problem brings up the question "Just how
many MS-DOS 5.00s are there are how can you tell ?" I must admit to
having been buried in antiquity with my studies of antediluvian boot
sectors but this controversy and the accompanying VER /R debacle
brought this up.

        First, I am sure that by now everyone knows that no matter
which version of MS-DOS 5.00 is booted (from the beta 5.00.409c (1990)
to the beta 6.00.0015 (1992)), VER /R returns "Revision A".

        Just checking through my stuff I have found three different
released versions of MS-DOS 5.00 dated 03-22-91, 04-09-91, and
11-11-91. All report simply MS-DOS 5.00 though various components are
different (all COMMAND.COMs COMPare the same @ 47845 bytes & VER is an
internal command).

        For completeness, I would like to know if there are any other
MS-DOS 5.00s out there and is there any differentiation between them
other than date (to spare the group, please reply privately to
padgett@tccslr.dnet.mmc.com, I will post any interesting discoveries).
Please only *real* Microsoft versions - I know of different DOS 5.0s
from IBM, COMPAQ and ZENITH for example.

                                        Warmly,

I might mention that the FreeWare NoFBoot (one of the FixUtils) will
accomplish this by denying reboots if a floppy is in the A drive.
Since rarely do users really want to boot from a floppy, this can be
an effective defense (of course if they *really* want to boot from a
floppy, VSHIELD cannot stop a fast finger either...)

Unfortunately the 04/09/91 version of MS-DOS 5 *also* claims to be
Version 5.00 Revision A. I know: I still use it :-( This seems to
reduce its utility in detecting which version of DOS5 you have.

Subject: INFO SOUGHT: FILLED virus (PC)

One of my leaf sites (news/mail) recently lost their data to FILLED -
the machine that went down (FAT out to lunch) was repaired by
reformatting the disk (high level, w/MS-DOS 5.0) and re-installing the
software.

When SCANV was run, it warned of FILLED three times, after the format
- - local rumour has it FILLED resides on an area of the disk DOS
doesn't read - at any rate, after three warnings, the system was shut
down.

I installed the latest versions of SCANV and CLEAN onto the system
today, and ran both from a write-protected floppy. No warning
appeared, and clean aborted with nothing to do. I did not try the
older version of SCANV again.

Is it gone? Is there a difference in the latest flavour of SCANV's
approach to FILLED that might cause a miss? FILLED is listed as a
stealth-type in the McAfee doc's, and I'd like to know more about that
as well - enough, at any rate, to be comfortable in thinking the
infection is gone.

If someone can point me towards an ftp site where I can find some
information re FILLED, I'd appreciate it, or it could be mailed to me
privately if it's 'old hat' - if not, here's fine :-)

Hmm, this is strange. I also have DOS 5.0 on my machine (but ask me
about Linux!), and I tried this, just for kicks. I don't remember
every character of the output, but I'm quite sure that it said, among
other things, "DOS 5.0", NOT "DOS 5.00", and the "Revision A" was
definitely missing. I don't remember the exact date on which I bought
the upgrade, but it was quite early on; late April or early May? It
was a special offer from Egghead, $39.95.

Have you actually looked at the program with a debugger? I bet that it
indeed does what F-Prot warns you about.

One more user who either has not read the documentation carefully, or
does not understand the abilities and the limitations of the heuristic
scanning.

The heuristics cannot tell you whether the program contains a virus or
not. They can only tell you whether the program does some strange
things that are usually used by viruses. Even this cannot be always
discovered! If the heuristics do not report a file as suspicious, this
means NOTHING, except that they have been unable to find anything
suspicious in it... It might contain a virus, nevertheless...

Conversely, if they tell you that a program does suspicious things,
this means ONLY that the program indeed does so - it doesn't mean that
it is infected. Of course, the infected programs cause such warnings
with a greater probability.

If you don't understand the above deeply, you should not use the
heuristic scanning.

So much for the integrity checking... I disagree with Dave here, but
it is not very relevant, because IBM has much more experience with
users than me. Lots of products are providing you the "ultimate
solution to the virus problem" (integrity checking), "no updates
necessary", etc. IBM says that users don't want integrity checking. We
all know that known-virus scanners are useless against new viruses and
monitoring programs can be easily bypassed. Somebody is deadly wrong;
the question is - who?...

If the checksum of a file has changed, but (a) its size has also
changed, (b) its date/time has also changed, (c) the entry point does
not point after the previous end of the file, (d) lots of things in
the EXE header (e.g., the relocation items) have changed too, (e) the

disinfection algorithms, (f) no other (or very few other) files have
changed in the same way, then chances are that the cause of the change

to make a virus that will pass the above test. An intelligent
heuristic should be able to detect that and to inform the user
properly.

Hey, they should be really power users, if they know how to do that!
For instance, I don't know how it can be done, without reformatting
the disk, or using a sector editor... And anybody who is competent
enough to mess with a sector editor in the boot sector, should not be
surprised by a message that the said sector has been modified
afterwards...

The perfect solution is to provide the -flexibility-. Just put it
there (but make it s really good integrity checker!) and turn it off
by default. The docs should tell the user how to use it, if s/he wants
to. If s/he doesn't want to use it - no problem, it is turned off by
default anyway. The problem with the current situation is that you
don't allow the user to use integrity checking, even if s/he wants to!

Verifying the integrity of my programs or data seems important enough
to me, even if you are not interested in finding viruses... Besides,
the vast majority of the non-viral changes can be detected as such,
with the proper use if intelligently designed heuristics.

If you've come about a virus, suspected or real, using OS/2 2.0, I'd
like to hear about it.

Thanks to all of those who replied re the disk replication. It turned
out the user *had* changed the SCSI switch and set it to 7. I changed
it to 1 and was soon able to recover files and fix the Allocation
taBLEs. Thanks for all msgs

The common misunderstanding on this question arises from the fact that
Dr. Cohen uses the term "virus" in a broader sense than most of us.
For his exact definition you should look in his Ph.D. thesis or in his
paper "Computational Aspects of Computer Viruses", published in
"Computers & Security". Look at the mathematical definition; the
natural-language one is just as inexact as everybody else's. In
general, he usually calls a "virus" any program that spreads in any
way. Like the XCOPY program, for instance...

This is a result of the misunderstanding of the definitions. I know at
least three anti-virus packages, which are "benevolent viruses",
according to Dr. Cohen's definition. The supervisor installs them on
the LAN server -once- and each time a user logs in, the package
automatically installs (or updates) itself on the user's workstation.
Therefore, the package propagates from the server to the workstations
like a virus (or like a worm, if we want to be precise).

There's nothing bad in the above. Only the supervisor can install the
package and by definition the supervisor has the full right to decide
under what conditions the users are allowed to log in. These
conditions may include a requirement that the workstation that is
granted access to the LAN runs the latest version of a particular
anti-virus software. Therefore, there are no ethical problems involved
- - if you don't like that policy, don't use that LAN.

In fact, this ability makes the anti-virus packages that I mentioned
more competitive, compared to the other, similar ones. Several people
will prefer to have the ability to update all installations
automatically, instead of going from PC to PC and doing it manually.

The integrity problem could probably be solved with the usage of
some kind of public-key authentication scheme...

Thank you Aryeh.
Taking specific conversations offline to email is a great suggestion!

I think that, generally speaking, everyone who posts to the digest
should ask themselves

 'Do I really want to send this to thousands of people
  (who may think "<sigh> s/he must like to hear her/himself speak")
  or does this only apply to one or two people?'

This digest is a terrific resource, we should make an effort to
keep it from turning into something nobody likes...

     An  MtE virus simulation test suite generator is  available 
     suitable   for   use   by   general   end   users,   system 
     administrators  and  educators. These safe  and  controlled 
     virus  simulations set off MtE virus detectors for  testing 
     and demonstrations without the danger associated with their 
     malicious virus counterparts.
 
     Virus  Simulator  (introduced earlier) and this  new  Virus 
     Simulator  MtE Supplement are not intended to  replace  the 
     comprehensive   collection   of  real  virus   samples   as 
     maintained  by Rosenthal Engineering and  other  anti-virus 
     product   developers  for  testing.  Virus  Simulator   MtE 
     Supplement  produces safe and controlled dummy  test  files 
     that  enable users to verify that they have  installed  and 
     are  using  their MtE virus detecting  programs  correctly, 
     additionally  affording  an  opportunity  for  a   practice 
     training drill under safe and controlled conditions.
