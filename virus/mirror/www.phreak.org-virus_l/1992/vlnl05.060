The "CAPS LOCK" behaviour was present in 386 -12/16 machines running
MS-DOS 4.0 and MS-DOS 3.30, running resident "History" (which keeps
the last 20? commands interpreted by command.com), after removing the
history the problem vanished. It has sense to somebody?

P.D. I miss pointed out that usual keyboard behaviour was  recovered
if you press "SHIFT"+F3; but after a while the problem return.

Hi,

a friend of mine has lost his hard disk this morning. He thinks it was
the michelangelo virus and asked me, whether its possible, to get some
of his data back. What data destroys michelangelo? Does it overwrite
the FAT, the partition table, the files or all sectors?

Thanks,

Subject: Handling ''Stoned'' floppy (PC)

I have a copy of the ''Stoned'' virus on a floppy (verified by both
McAffee and Norton). McAffee says that it's in the boot sector.

How would this virus transfer itself to other computers? It's a
(non-bootable) 'data disk'; ie, it was formatted without system
files copied to it. How are viruses transferred via non-bootable
diskettes? Would someone have to attempt to boot a computer with
this disk? Or would any Read performed on this diskette result in
the virus being transferred?

If I wanted to make a copy of this diskette, what would be a
safe way to do it? I.e., would an ordinary DISKCOPY (to another
floppy) risk loading this virus into my computer?

Actually, this floppy diskette _should_ be a data disk. I would
like to check to make sure whether it truly is, but how would I
do this without risking further infection?

Thanks im voraus,

Subject: Question on Empire virus (PC)

A computer in our office was recently acting sketchy, and on
inspecting it with a virus scanner it was shown to have a virus called
the Empire virus.  Running a cleaning program seemed to have
eradicated it, but the computer still is acting somewhat funny.  The
total bytes of memory is still a little bit less than 655360 when we
run a CHKDSK on it.  Does anyone know what the Empire virus is
supposed to do, and does it have any lingering effects?  What are some
possible reasons why the CHKDSK memory total could still be coming up
short?

Subject: Questions about the Stoned Virus (PC)

One of my professors here at Acadia has been having a recurring
problem with the No-Int Stoned virus.  I, as well as our computer
centre, have cleaned it off his machine using MacAfee's Clean program
and FDSIK /MBR among others.

My questions are:

How is the Virus transferred?  We try to scan all disks prior to their
use in the machine, but it never finds anything.  I have installed the
VSHIELD program and it doesn't seem to catch it prior to infection.

Once the drive has been cleaned, we are having problems with storing
and retreval of files (almost requiring a complete re-installation).
Does this virus do anything other than infect the partition table?
Is there a way to correct the problems it creates (clean it out) and
have reasonably good performace afterwards??

This problem is getting on our nerves (it has happened several times
in the last few months).  If anyone has a suggestion for a program
that would protect the drive (or suggested settings for VSHIELD)
I would appreciate any help.

Subject: False positive on "Telecom" virus ?? (PC)

Folks -

In the wake of the recent Michelangelo hype (yes, I know it's bad, but
so are lots of other viruses), we downloaded a copy of the Demo
version of CentralPoint AntiVirus (only detects/cleans Michelangelo
and Friday the 13th).

I created a bootable 3.5, and put CPAV on it.  When I boot from this
diskette and run CPAV, I show no infections.  When I run SCAN (85)
on the memory, hard disk, and diskette I show no infections.  When I
run F-prot 2.02D, an infection of "Telecom" is detected in memory.

Now - I have found no mention of "Telecom" in F-PROT's virus list
(unless it's listed as an alias somewhere).  F-PROT never detects
"Telecom" as infecting the hard disk or any floppy diskette.  No
other diskettes seem to become infected when "Telecom" is supposedly
in memory (I've tried formatting /s diskettes, putting executable
files on the diskette and running them...).

My experience with CPAV is that it doesn't correctly encrypt virus
signature strings, and given the other symptoms, I tend to believe
that the report is a "false positive".

Anyone have information regarding "Telecom" or experience with this
problem?

Subject: Possible virus? (PC)

Yesterday, March 5 when I checked my directory I noticed that all
files saved that day were listed as saved on 2-16-92.  This worried me
as I had not altered the date when booting up the system.  This
reminded me of an instance last year when the date on my MS-DOS floppy
I was using at the time started giving me the date 2-22-91 instead of
the usual 1-1-80 (it was version 3.20, I think).  I'm not a computer
scientist and have just enough knowledge to see a potential problem --
but non answers.  Has anyone encountered a similar problem?  I'd
appreciate some advice.

Subject: A "sometimes workable" solution for the FORM virus (PC)

Maarten,

        Here's a procedure we've found that works for the FORM virus
around here.  Sometimes this works, other times it doesn't.  If we
catch the virus in time, before it's had too long to "munch away",
this has worked for us so I thought I'd pass it on.  Whenever you hear
back from McAfee, please let me know directly since we also use their
anti-virus software.

        As a little background, we have 40Mg hard drives using DOS 4.01 and
DOS 5.0.  The procedure has worked on these machines as well as other
configurations................Marc
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  1) After you clean the virus off the hard disk, just try to re-boot
     the machine to see if it comes up.

  2) If that doesn't work, use a boot disk, (making sure that it is the
     same version of DOS that is on that machine), make sure that the
     boot disk has SYS.COM on the disk.

  3) When it boots to the A-Drive type SYS C:, when this is done, copy
     COMMAND.COM from the boot disk over to C.  This should work.

  4) If this doesn't help, I am open for some suggestions.....

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After a little more experimenting (McAfee asked me for more details) I
must conclude that in *most* cases CLEAN isn't able to remove the Form
virus, whether it (the virus) resides on hard disk or on floppies, and
whatever DOS version you are using.

- - --> Don't use CLEAN to remove the FORM virus from your hard disk, as it
    will become unaccessible afterwards!!! Use SYS C: (the DOS command)
    instead (starting with a clean, write-protected floppy of course).

The only case in which CLEAN was successful, was on a system booted
with MS-DOS 3.3 where the virus had to be removed from a 360K floppy
formatted with MS-DOS 3.3. All other attempts to remove the virus from
floppy or hard disk, whatever DOS version booted with or formatted the
infected disk, how many partitions on the hard disk, and whatever hard
disk size (20, 40 or >=60 MB), failed. (All hard disks with standard
FDISK-mbr and a bootable C-partition).

On hard disks, CLEAN takes a random sector from the disk and puts it
in place of the bootsector. I could trace the original location of
this sector.  On floppy disks, CLEAN tells that it has found the Form
virus in "1 file" (meaning the boot sector, I suppose), but that it
isn't able to correctly replace it.

If in fact your hard disk has become unaccessible to DOS, use a sector
editor to locate the original bootsector on your hard disk. The Form
virus puts it at the last *physical* sector of the disk, no matter how
many partitions you have. From there you (or your disk wizzard) can
copy it back the original location - which is *not* the first physical
sector!  Beware of overwriting the *master* boot record!

We have had two students infected with the above viruses. Student #1
infected #2 by giving him infected diskettes. Student #1's machine was
so severely affected that he finally gave up and is 'starting from

A question: both of these people were using a compression program

files manipulated by such a program ?

I have recommended that after disinfecting/restoring their systems,
that these people STOP using STACKER. Any comments about such programs
will be appreciated.

     I haven't seen so much excitement since the Harmonic Convergence.
     This is to remind you that I am collecting statistics on how
 many disks were damaged by Michelangelo virus on or about March 6.
 Please keep a tally of credible damage reports in your vicinity until
 about Wednesday, 11 March (I've pushed the date because so many are asking
 for this report).  I think we ought to include reports from news media
 if they seem believable and identify specific sites.  I'll keep
 those separate.  I will take great pains to eliminate duplicate reports.
 I will post results here, maybe as early as the 16th.
     Tonight I will attempt to develop an electronic questionnaire for
 you to fill out (aka fill up):  please wait for it.

Miscellany:
     March 3.  Heard on Paul Harvey's syndicated radio broadcast
 (a news commentator/broadcaster heard all over the USA): I quote
 without permission.   After talking about the M virus:  " ... you can buy
 anti-virus software for a few hundred dollars --- it might be worth it."
 After some advice on Safe Computing:  " ...and then Don't..Swap..Disks..

Leaving the computers off all of March 6th would keep the virus from
triggering.  My suggestion would be that if you have encountered the
Michelangelo virus, to leave untested machines off until you could
boot them from a clean floppy, and test the hard drive.  If you are
not sure you have a clean floppy, then by all means leave the machines
off until you have a clean one.  If you have been searching for
viruses, and haven't found Michelangelo, I wouldn't be too paranoid
about it.

First, I have to take exception with the subject. The real question is
Integrity Management by OSs, Virus protection is just one result.

Not if done properly. First all previously existing viruses would become
obsolete if implimented properly (validation of .COM files is the only
sticky point). This alone would be a great help.

Next, with the same caveat, all techniques used by current viruses would
become obsolete so the present cloning practise would stop (Michelangelo
is really a clone of STONED).

Also, while new techniques would be possible, they would require much more
effort and code. A 100 byte virus would not be possible anymore with the
result that many hiding places would go away and it would take much more
programming effort on the part of virus writers (why there have not been
any widespread mainframe viruses).

Finally, we could eliminate a whole class of virus - those accounting for
more than half of all reported infections and including Mich again - and
be reasonably sure that when DOS loads, the system is clean.

IMHO there is no longer any excuse for there being NO checking from the
OS.

Subject: How much memory in a PC? (PC)

There were a couple of questions in the most recent (v5 n48) Virus-l
bulletin about the total memory seen when using CHKDSK. A little
explanation might help:

In the old days when the IBM PC first came out some were sold with as
little as 64K of memory installed. Part of the self-test that occurs
when you apply power is a determination of exactly how much memory  is
in your PC. The number is saved in memory and can be accessed by any
program (or the operating system). Thus a program that runs in a small
amount of memory can use additional memory, if available, if its
performance can be improved by doing so. A program that needs a large
amount of memory can be prevented from running at all if the needed
memory isn't available; that's nicer than crashing.

The number can also be modified. On an XT clone I use the ROM BIOS
modifies this number, effectively telling the operating system and any
program  I run that my computer has only 638K, not 640K. The BIOS uses
that 2K for something, I'm not sure what. If I had only 512K installed
in my computer the BIOS would still take that 2K and leave 510K
available. Apparently some PS/2 machines do something similar.

Any program that wants to permanently take some memory out of use can
modify this number. That's what Michelangelo and some other viruses do.
They then use that upper 1 or 2K themselves. Their resident portion
will never be overwritten in the normal course of things because the
operating system is told there is no memory there. But it's not just
viruses that use this trick.

If you run CHKDSK and find you don't have a full 640K you don't
necessarily have a virus.  You must know what number is normally
reported for the size of memory when your system is clean. It might be
less than 640K to begin with.

Subject: F-PROT and invalid Programs (PC)

With the recent media blitz on viruses and our local announcements of
our new FPROT site license, we have a lot of new F-PROT users.  I am
about to help with some things that are reported, espcially the false
alarms caused by Central Point AV.
  I am not clear on what to do when FPROT (V2.02D) reports an
 INVALID PROGRAM
Any suggestions?
One other thing that has caused some confusion and consternation is
the reports of " packed (not scanned " files.  The confusion arises
because they arent reported consistently.  FPROT will only tell you
able the "not scanned" files if it has something else to tell you as
well, (e.g. INVALID PROGRAM, or INFECTION).  Then the " not scanned "
messages tend to bury the "infection" messages in the report and
people panic when they cant make it out...

That point was made about car anti-theft alarms: the new luxury cars
that come with factory-standard alarms must be very good because a
would-be thief only has to beat one to know how to do it again.
It's much harder to approach a car with an unknown alarm system.

Unfortunately, however, he didn't quote my response to that argument
which was that...

        "Of course, someone would eventually write a virus to subvert
        such protection, but 95% of virus damage is caused by the 10
        most common viruses today, e.g., Stoned, Jerusalem, Joshi.
        Protection against 95% of viruses is better than protection
        against 0%."

I still think this is a valid argument.  I did not mean to imply that
operating system manufacturers should have to make an OS 100% secure
against viruses.  Rather, they should make it secure against the
current crop of common viruses that cause almost all of the damage.
As Padgett has said, protection from almost all boot sector viruses
could be accomplished in a few dozen bytes of code so there would be
no investment of time or money.

The question of why OS writers don't use compression schemes is not in
fact analagous because taking up less disk space is just a nice feature,
but being totally unsecured against a virus attack damages the trust
that users should be able feel in their operating system. (By the way,
a compression scheme is in fact slated to be included in a update of
OS/2 2.0.)  A truly analagous (invalid) argument to the one Mr. Russell
makes would be that car manufacturers shouldn't build door locks into
cars because someone would just invent a pick to break the lock.  I hope
the flaw is apparant in both cases.

Hi,

I have just received an invitation from the NCSA for Virus Research.
Would any of the readers know of the places I could approach for
grants?

Stealth Bomber version 2.2 (formerly CRCSET) has been uploaded to the
following locations:

risc.ua.edu (/pub/ibm-antivirus/stealth.zip) and
ux1.cso.uiuc.edu.

Uploads to other sites are pending.

Stealth Bomber is a programmer's tool: it is an anti-virus protection
utility that uses a 32-bit CRC to test the integrity of the running
program and any supporting files.  It also performs a basic system check
for any viruses that may evade detection by a file check.  Supporting
code is in C and Turbo Pascal and full documentation is included.  (DOS)

Stealth Bomber is also being reviewed (favourably) in this month's Virus
Bulletin.
