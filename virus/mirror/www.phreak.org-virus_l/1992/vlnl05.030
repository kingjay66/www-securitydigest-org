Subject: Maltese Amoeba report (PC)

  Stiller Research Virus Report - Copyright 1992 - The Maltese
  Amoeba

  Aliases: Irish (McAfee), Grain of Sand, Amoeba (mistakenly)

  A destructive memory resident infector of .COM and .EXE files.
  It will activate on Nov 1st and March 15th.

  The Maltese Amoeba is another variable encrypting virus.  This
  means that the bulk of the virus code is encrypted and the
  decryption routine uses variations of several patterns of
  instructions similar to the technique used in the V2Px series of
  viruses.  The decryption instructions are interspersed with
  variable numbers of irrelevant instructions and can appear in a
  varying order.  While various (different) series of instructions
  are used for the decryption, the decryption is always accomplished
  by a simple exclusive or.  The Maltese Amoeba infects only .COM
  and .EXE files using a different decryption pattern for .COM and
  than for .EXE files.

    It uses no stealth techniques and can be detected by doing a
  simple DIR and noting the file size changes.  Its only
  sophistication lies in its ability to make generation of virus
  scan strings difficult.  This virus spread quite readily on all
  PCs tested (7).  It will infect files on either a DOS open or a
  load and execute (files read or executed programs will be
  infected).  After the first infected file is executed, the Maltese
  Amoeba goes resident in memory in the highest available 2K
  (usually at 9F00:0000 if 655,360 bytes are free).  It seems to
  play by the DOS rules and changes the MCBs (memory control blocks)
  so that DOS does not overlay the virus code, but it does not issue
  the DOS TSR request (no doubt in order to bypass monitoring
  programs).  This reduction in memory can be seen by doing a CHKDSK
  or a MEM command.

     This virus checks for its own presence in memory by issuing a
  DOS set date call with an invalid value and also checks for
  presence (in memory) of Ross Greenberg's anti-virus programs
  (FluShot+ and Virex-PC) as well as the PSQR virus.  If these
  programs are present the virus will not infect any programs.  It
  reportedly also detects and deactivates the Murphy virus but I
  have not confirmed this.  The virus will replace the (Int 24)
  critical error handler so you will not see the familiar "Abort,
  Retry, Fail" if the virus tries to infect a write protected
  floppy.

     On Nov 1st or March 15th (March is going to be a rough month!),
  it will overwrite low numbered tracks on the hard disk and any
  diskettes, produce a flashing display and hang the PC.  The disk
  will probably be unreadable at this point.  I have not actually
  allowed this virus to destructively activate on my test systems;
  my results are based upon code inspection and reports published in
  the (UK) Virus Bulletin.  The code written into the partition
  sector (AKA Master boot record) contains encrypted poetry which
  displays the first four lines of Blake's Auguries of Innocence
  from the Pickering Manuscripts:

  "To see a world in a grain of sand
  And a heaven in a wild flower,
  Hold infinity in the palm of your hand
  And eternity in a hour."

  The Virus 16/3/91

  The next time the PC is booted the above text is displayed -- the
  PC then hangs.

  The remainder of the partition sector will contain unencrypted
  ASCII text.  This text names the virus "AMOEBA" and proclaims that
  the University of Malta "destroyed 5X2 years of human life". This
  implies that the virus was written by two students who did not do
  very well at this university. (Note, there is another virus more
  commonly known as AMOEBA so this name should NOT be used for this
  virus)

  =========== End of Virus report =========

  Since this virus will soon activate (March 15th), I suggest that
  you check your software to make sure it can detect this virus.  I
  understand that it is prevalent mostly in the UK and Europe.


  A little editorial comment here.  This virus was not detected
  prior to its activation in the UK on November 1st 1991.  It had
  managed to spread quite widely!  According to the December 1991
  Virus Bulletin: "Prior to November 2nd, 1991, no commercial or
  shareware scanner (of which VB has copies) detected the Maltese
  Amoeba virus.  Tests showed that not ONE of the major commercial
  scanners in use (the latest releases of Scan, Norton Anti-virus,
  Vi-Spy, VISCAN, Findvirus, Sweep, Central Point Anti-virus et al.)
  detected this virus."

  This indicates the danger of depending upon scanner technology or
  active monitor technology for virus protection.

    Folks:

    In our office we recently got a practical lesson in virus
    prevention when one of our PCs crashed with virus-like symptoms.
    No virus was found, and the PC was backed up, so we are just
    wiser and not sadder for the experience.  The information we
    learned from the experts involved in virus detection and clean-up
    is worth passing on -- especially since there is a particularly
    nasty virus going around right now. Following are the details as
    best as I know them:

    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    VIRUS ALERT                                        1/31/92


    A computer virus called "stoned" has been damaging systems in the
    Washington DC area, and may have spread to other areas.

    A known source for the "stoned" virus in the Washington area is
    on commercially duplicated copies of MS DOS 4.01 packaged and
    sold with new Win brand computers.  The virus was apparently put
    on many diskettes when Win Laboratories in Manassas, VA had DOS
    4.01 duplicated by another company. Many federal and private
    offices purchased Win computers with DOS 4.01 in 1991.

    This virus is extremely widespread. Not only was it transmitted
    through duplicates of MS DOS 4.01, it is also extremely
    contagious. Also, since it is believed that the virus was put on
    diskettes at a commercial duplication lab (without their
    knowledge, of course), it is possible that copies of other
    commercial software may carry the virus.

    If you have a Win computer with DOS 4.01 installed, the copy
    installed by the computer dealer should be OK. But do not use the
    DOS diskettes that came with the computer.  These diskettes are
    clearly marked "Win Laboratories, Ltd."  One way to protect
    yourself in this case is to upgrade to DOS 5.0 and toss your old
    copies of 4.01.

    If you use a MS DOS 4.01 or other source diskette with the
    "stoned" virus you will get a message "Your PC is now stoned,"
    hence the name.  The virus attacks the boot files and destroys
    the file allocation table of both the hard drive and any floppy
    disks it corrupts. Eventually it makes floppys unreadable and
    causes hard drives to crash.

    The "stoned" virus can be readily transmitted by diskette. In
    this case the warning message does not appear.  It is not
    necessary to copy files from a diskette onto a hard drive, or
    even read them in order to spread the virus.  Just reading the
    directory of a floppy disk can transmit the virus from hard drive
    to floppy or vice versa.  Write-protect stickers will prevent
    transmission of the virus by floppy disk.

    Downloading corrupted files by modem will also transmit this and
    other viruses. Some fileservers include anti-virus programs to
    protect users, but it is best to rely on protecting yourself.

    Current versions of both Norton's Anti-Virus and Central Point
    Anti-Virus have been used successfully to detect and destroy the
    "stoned" virus.  They have also been used to recover data from
    corrupted diskettes and hard drives, when the problem was caught
    in time. (This information should not be construed as an
    endorsement of these products.)

    Computer technicians advise the use of general anti-virus
    precautions to protect your computer and your data. Use an
    anti-virus program and upgrade frequently.  Scan all foreign
    diskettes, even commercially purchased programs. If files are
    packed, unpack them to a floppy disk and scan them before copying
    them to your hard drive.  When you download data from a network,
    download it to a floppy disk,  unpack to another floppy if
    necessary, and scan the data before copying it to your hard
    drive. Scanning it again after you have loaded it to your hard
    drive is also a good idea. Scan your hard drive before backing it
    up and back up frequently. If you do detect a virus on a disk,
    notify the company or individual who gave it to you so they can
    stop transmitting it themselves.  If your computer system becomes
    infected, do not transmit any files over the network or give
    anyone a diskette until you are sure you have gotten rid of the
    virus.

    Finally, in case any users reading this have an opportunity to
    influence young minds with a cautionary tale: this virus has
    brought down the computer system of at least one area hospital,
    thus endangering lives as well as data.  Apparently the creators
    of such viruses think of them as practical jokes.  No one here is
    laughing.

    I've TRIED to use FPROT v2.0 and it doesn't seem to work on my XT
computer.  All it does is give a blank blue screen and that's all.

    I've followed it's install.doc file, but it still gives me the
blue screen.  I know this might be a bit old considering that v2.02d
is out, but like I was wondering if FPROT works on XT's.

    Has anyone else have that kind of problem?

Subject: System Troubles... (PC)

I'm wondering if anyone can help me with a problem.  I am one of the
few students/people on campus knowledgeable of computer viri - most
students and faculty come to me for help.  Admittedly, I am in the
weaning stages of becoming a viral-guru and have never ran across this
type of problem.  Included is a letter sent to me from a faculty
member here at our college.

I'm not sure exactly what machine he's working on, but I know he had a
Dark Avenger infection last semester and reformatted his HD to remove
it.  I haven't had a chance to check out his system yet (I use
McAffe's Scan/Clean V85) but I'm guessing it may be a virus - not to
cry wolf :)

Please send to my address as to not clutter up the list.  Any help
will be appreciated.  Thanks.

I've just checked with IBM Personal Computer DOS Version 3.30 and
FF-File Find, Advanced Edition 4.50:
The above command produces the response
      no files found.

Maybe an older DOS would do the trick?

To whom it may concern:

To my knowledge, Yankee Doodle just infects .COM and .EXE files.  From
what I've seen, it likes BASICA.COM to start off with.  It also likes
to inhabit the Windows directory also.

Yankee Doodle isn't a malicious virus like 'Possessed' is... To put it
in my supervisor's words, it's a fun virus.  When it's done it's work,
it plays the tune of 'Yankee Doodle'.  It's readily cleaned up with
CPAV or Mcaffee (SP?) software.

Subject: Viruses and Backups (PC)

I'm not sure if this has been discussed here or not, but I have been
wondering about the danger of backups being damaged by viruses.

A friend recently backed up his PC hard disk using a popular backup
utility.  This utility uses a non-MS-DOS format.

After performing the backup, the hard disk was reformatted, and an
attempt was made to restore the files.  But the data on the backup
disks had been damaged and could not be restored.  The company who
made the backup program was called, and they were not able to repair
the disks.

It was later discovered that all of the machines in this particular
lab were infected with Stone-related viruses.

Could Stone have overwritten what it thought was "safe" space on an
MS-DOS diskette, only to damage backup data?

This seems like a significant problem.  At least it was for my friend,
who lost the entire contents of his hard drive.

Subject: Cinderella virus/ does VSHIELD work? (PC)

	I have recently had a very bad run in with Cinderella, losing
about 200 files. I think i found my problem after a while, but i'm
still a bit paranoid.
	When my compiler started acting up (keys wouldn't work), i, on
a n off chance, scanned my system. It seemed a good number of files
were infected (about 20, at which point i simply quit the scanner and
rebooted).I booted from a write protected floppy with vshield and scan
(the one that was new two months ago or so) and scanned again. Command
com was gone of course, as were every other .com file i had. I checked
the other partition, same there.
	After deleting all .com files (mcaffery said it couldn't fix
any of them and just wiped them out), i rebooted again off disk then
copied command.com to the harddrive.
	Here's the problem. Everytime i scanned it, it came out bad.
After scanning 12 times or so (scanned the one on teh disk i was copying
from. it was good), i tried copying cc to the hardrive then doing
 a dir (and viewing it with norton). The file was 47k. I then thought
great, it works, and scanned it, and post-scan it was 48k and infected.
I think i finally figured out it was hooked in memory (i warm booted-
will cinderella survive this?) and when i touched anything with scan,
scan infected the file (scan itself passed the scan check with three other
scanners; not infected and writeprotected). So effectievly, scanning
my whole hard drive infected my whole harddrive. What's
up?
	Actually, i was just wondering, if cindy was following in
scans tracks, why wasn't vshield picking it up? At work we always say
vshiled is worthless (it's failed to protect against stoned,
michelangelo and liberty), but i used it anyway at home (blind faith,
or, could more hurt?).  It should have picked up any attempt to infect
a file. right? Does it just not work (tried three version releases of
vshield)? Or was my file getting infected another way (i turned off
the machine for an hour and no more infections during scan)? What am i
missing here?

Greetings.  A student here at Bard is interested in doing a senior
project about the similarities between computer viruses and the
biological kind, most notibly bacteriophage.  I know that this topic
has at times been discussed here (or perhaps even beaten to death), so
I was wondering if anyone reading this knows of anything scholarly or
otherwise that has been written on the subject.

Thanks!  Please post replies to the address below.

Maybe "multi-host" viruses? I expect them to appear pretty soon;
especially a PC/Atari ST boot sector virus seems quite trivial to
me...

Subject: List of all viruses available?

Apologies if this has been asked before, is there a listing of the
known viruses, their names, major symptoms and possible cures? It
would help when trying to follow discussions on the list as I'm new
around here.

Many thanks
