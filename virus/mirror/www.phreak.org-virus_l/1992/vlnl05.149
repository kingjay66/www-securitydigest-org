Ah, so it's the No_Frills virus.

Indeed, F-Prot doesn't know about it. However, now Frisk has a copy of
it, so let's hope that it will be included in the next version. The
virus seems to be in the wild, but is still local to Australia.

Since version 91 the words "Clean" and "identifies" should not be used
together... :-)

The contents of VIRLIST.TXT has nothing to do with what SCAN 95
actually outputs as virus names. The virus properties listed in that
file also are not entirely correct...

> Question: What does No Frills do and can it be removed.

It doesn't do anything remarkable. A memory resident COM & EXE fast
file infector. Avoids infecting files like SC*.E* and CO*.C*.
Infective length is 843 bytes. No payload (at least I didn't notice
one). The easiest way to remove it is to delete the infected files.

If there is a need for a more detailed description, I'll post one.

He still can - if he bothers to find out where your checksum is and to
patch it or to patch the piece of code that is performing the check.

Not true. First, a virus which knows where your checksum is, could
simply re-compute it on the already infected file and patch it. Or
just remove it. Or patch the checking code. Or modify the file without
modifying the checksum (I understand that you intend to use CRC-32 and
in this case it is trivial, if the generator is known).

Second, the virus could be a stealth one. When you start the infected
program, the virus will receive control first. It will then go stealth
and intercept all read requests to the file and modify their results
in such a way that the fill will look as if it is not infected.
Therefore, the checking code (which will receive control after the
virus) will not detect the change.

The method that you are describing will work only against the simple
(non-stealth) viruses and against viruses which do not know about
your program.

True, but relatively few people are still using DOS version below 3.0.

It will be almost unnoticeable. The slowdown will be more significant
when the program is run from a floppy.

Had you been subscribed to this group for longer, you would without
any doubt have heard about the stealth viruses.

> Also, I never saw a self-protected program.  Even an anti-virus program

Most anti-virus programs nowadays are using this method. Not that it
works in all cases, but a protection against the simple viruses only
is better than no protection at all, right?

As far as I understand, you intend to use CRC-32 for your checksum. In
this case, please have in mind that it relatively trivial to break it,
if the generator is known. CRC checksums have been designed for
detection of random errors (caused by line noise), not for detection
of malicious attack. If you want to be more secure, use CRC-32 with a
randomly generated polynomial or even better, use MD4 or MD5. However,
even this will not help you to detect an infection by a stealth virus.

Quoted from one of the documentation files (PROBLEM.DOC):

"F-PROT cannot be used on a single-floppy machine without a hard disk
or network connections. This is because if the F-PROT is run from a
diskette, the diskette may not be removed while the program is
running, so other diskettes cannot be inserted for scanning."

If your machine has a hard disk, then scan it first (to ensure that it
is virus-free). Afterwards, copy the F-Prot files there and start
F-Prot from there. You'll be able to scan diskettes without problems.

It's not a virus; it's a joke program. If you run it, it goes TSR and
each time you press Alt-B, a bunch of crudely drawn (using text
characters) bugs begin to eat your text screen. When you press a key,
the bugs disappear and the previous contents of the screen is
restored.

By "exhaustive test" he means exhaustive test. He has generated 256

Problem is, the distinction does not seem to be very clearly described
(or at least emphasized) in the docs, since lots of people are
confusing those two terms.

Correct. It is indeed so. Unfortunately, the manual says exactly the
opposite.

And, if the user is given the right to modify the rights, the virus
could do so as well and to set the Write right, even if it is not
initially set. A more exact configuration that prevents virus
infection can be found in Dr. Cohen's paper.

> infection.  The only other attribute which stops viral infection, out

The only thing that the ExecuteOnly attribute stops is that it stops
the supervisor from performing proper backups and integrity checks and
therefore detecting the infection. EXE files with ExecuteOnly
attribute set can be trivially infected by a companion virus - if the
rights permit file creation and/or renaming in that directory.

Furthermore, it is possible to use a PATH-companion virus attack,
which will make even the best protected files (i.e., those in
directories with only Read, Open, and FileScan rights set) look like
infected for a particular user. The presence of just one writable
directory (e.g., the user's home directory) is enough for this attack
to succeed.

> However, IMHO, careful assignment of rights will provide a better
> protection against virus propagation than no protection at all.

Correct. What Dr. Cohen has actually observed is that the "default"
configurations and even those configurations that are usually
considered "secure" do not actually prevent a virus attack. It -IS-
possible to set the right in a way that will stop viruses, it is just
not easy to figure out how exactly.

> I encourage Mr. Cohen to redesign his tests with a better

I encourage you to read Dr. Cohen's paper. Unfortunately, he refused
to make it available in electronical form, so you should refer to the
proceedings of the 2nd Virus Bulletin Conference.

His basic theory is that it is very difficult to figure out how to
manage the NetWare rights in a way that will stop virus attacks.

As already mentioned, the manual says exactly the opposite of what is
the truth. During his speech at the conference, Dr. Cohen presented a
photocopy of the manual page that claims that "attributes take
precedence over rights". The exact page numbers of the manual are
quoted in his paper.

Vesselin

P.S. I don't have the paper handy right now. We (the VTC-Hamburg) are
planning to repeat the tests, in order to verify the results.
Unfortunately, we can repeat only the Novell Netware tests (since we
don't have a Unix-based DOS server) and only for version 2.15. :-(

The virus that was rumored to have a name Freddy and to be able to
infect IBMBIO.COM turned out to be a rumor - or at least we have not
seen it yet. By "we" I mean CARO. The virus from Brazil we have,
therefore it has the priority. We don't give names to the viruses we

True in general, but this particular virus (Vacsina.05) does not
infect files with internal overlays or trailing configuration info.
So, in this particular case there is no danger.

I can only confirm that they are indeed a Dutch-based company and
produce anti-virus software. One of their anti-virus programmers is
Victor Smith. In fact, Gobbler seems to be mostly his work.

With an earlier version of the product, there was a complain from S &
S International that the manual used significant parts of the texts
(mainly the virus descriptions) from Dr. Solomon's Anti-Virus ToolKit.
I understand that this is no longer true with the current version of
the product.

If you have received the same version as me, be prepared that this IS
a beta version. It's full of bugs and the context-sensitive help is
far from complete. If your copy just hangs your machine when you
execute it, try again with 256 bytes environment (NOT 256 bytes of
FREE environment - the TOTAL environment must not exceed 256 bytes).

The product is using the standard CARO naming scheme for the viruses
it detects. I was told that it performs exact virus identification,
but I was unable to test that, since the program breaks with "Abnormal
program termination" message without producing any report file at all.
Maybe the reason is my monstrous directory structure - my virus
collection consists of about 4,100 infected executable files in more
than 2,300 directories.

The product is promising and probably will be a pretty good scanner -
when it gets ready, which now it definitively isn't.

Victor Smith has an e-mail address. Probably this is his private
e-mail address, not the official address of the company.

This is not a virus, but a jokes program (trojan). Sub-menu "Targets:"
in Menu "Scan" clearly says so; if you do not want to scan for trojans
and joke programs, move the cursor under the pertinent entry in the
submenu, and press the space bar. Cf. file SCAN.DOC which comes with

Fine! Everybody should do so.

Problem:  Step 3, above, will change the program, hence invalidate the
          checksum.
Solution: You will have to anticipate this in step 2, above.

Pitfall:  Almost any virus will have restored the core image of the
          program before the latter gains control.
Solution: As you have implicitely assumed (quote suppressed for
          conciseness), the program will have to check its disk file
          rather than its core image.

Problem:  When a stealth virus is active in memory, it will hide its
          presence from any other program (including your self-checking
          routine): the program file will appear unaltered, hence the
          checksum will compute correct.
Solution: You could try to tunnel under the virus (i.e. find the ROM
          address where your system invocation eventually is executed),
          then jump directly there to get hold of an unaltered disk
          file. However, this is not feasable in all circumstances.

> Also, I never saw a self-protected program.

So you never saw Word Perfect Vers 4.2, nor Dr. Solomon's Anti-Virus
Toolkit, F-Prot, or any other professionally designed anti-virus
program? :-)

> Even an anti-virus program

.. write-protected, of course! This will preclude infection of the
anti-virus program (which would refuse to work after an infection, on
account of the very scheme you proposed).

An anti-virus program should be used only after a clean boot, to avoid
the following problems with particular types of (possibly unknown)
viruses:
- - when a Fast File Infector is active in memory, it will infect every
  program scanned for viruses (raising the cost for the eventual
  cleaning);
- - when a Stealth Virus is active in memory, its infections are
  effectively invisible (hence scanning the disk is futile).

> Would it be safer to use a 32 bit checksum? [...]

>From the technical details I suppressed in the quote I infer that you are
planning to use a simple XOR type checksum. Imho, this would be too
obvious, too easy to guess and forge for a virus. You should invent a
more sophisticated scheme, involving a particular key for each program
(e.g. a XOR-ROL loop with the amount of rotating varying in the loop).

Even a self-checking program is not immune from specific attacks. Yet,
carefully designed self-checking will help to catch most viruses; and
those evading your self-checking routine will eventually be catched by
some other self-checking program.

Subject: F-prot false alarm? (PC)

Hi,

Just obtained F-prot 2.05 from simtel. Unpacked it and did a secure
scan.  To my surprise backup.exe (from dos 5.0) was reported as being
infected with the Stanco virus. The file was packed with pklite. I
Looked the virus up in the info table of f-prot and it says the virus
replicates only in compressed form??! Also Virstop didn't stop
backup.exe from running.  I think this is a false alarm (or I hope it
is).

Does anyone has more information regarding the Stanco virus?

Thanx,
Andy

While this is one good layer for checking, as a stand-alone it leaves
much to be desired since it relies on being able to trust itself. The
problem is that if yours is the only program doing sel-checking then a
virus could spread quite far before your program picks it up.

Another problem is that certain classes of viruses will either not
bother you program or will use different methods that will have your
algorithm work when you compute it. Spawning, Companion, & Path
viruses are all examples that will defeat a self-checking program that
does nothing else.

Also you have the situation of every copy of your program using the
same mechanism - all a virus has to do is to know what to change your
checksum to.

For this reason and for efficiency, I prefer a single TSR for this
purpose with a unique seedfor each machine (so that each PC has a
unique checksum for any particular application).

Of course, to protect against a directed attack, the TSR needs
extensive protection but IMHO this is more efficient approach. I am
glad to see that a significant number of AV vendors are using it.

					Warmly,
						Padgett

BTW, some years ago I found that it was possible to generate/validate
an algorithmic checksum at about 50k bytes/second on a 4.77 Mhz PCXT.
This includes disk access time since I did not trust what was in
memory.  A very powerful and fast mechanism would checksum 100% with
two different methods and validate the length of the file as well.

I understand that you have an Atari ST. I am not aware of an Atari
virus which has such a payload, but I am by no means an Atari virus
expert. Nevertheless, you could try checking for the presence of a
joke program loaded during the startup.

The Atari ST and the IBM PC use different CPUs, so the programs
designed to run on one of them cannot execute on the other. It is
perfectly possible to write a "dual-platform" virus (especially a boot
sector infector), but nobody has done this yet.

Subject: Looking for references (UNIX)

Hi,

could anybody please direct me to public (FTP) sources of any of the
following:

	1) Discussion/analysis of the workings (strategies employed)
		by the 1989 internet virus.
	2) Same as #1 for other similar incidents (were there any?).

I remember seeing a document analyzing the internet virus on some FTP
server about 2 years ago, but I have no recollection where that was. I
would prefer documents in either plain ASCII or postscript. Please
mail any responses to me as of lately our site seems to be
experiencing some problems receiving this group.

If there is interest I will summarize any responses and post them
to this group.

[Moderator's note: I believe that the May 1989 issue of the
Communications of the ACM was almost entirely on the Internet worm (of
November 1988, not 1989).]

Thank you

Subject: Is FTP/Kermit of sources safe?

I recently had a discussion with someone I am contracting my services
to...  I uploaded a piece of code to our HP-UX workstation that I
retrieved from a generous Usenet/Netnews writer.  It was all ascii
source code that I had to build into my program.  This _seems_ safe to
me.  (BTW I used kermit to upload the files to my system via a modem).

The person I talked to has heard horror stories of PC viruses damaging
file systems and one that was shipped to customers accidentally as
part of a product.  This person is NOT a programmer (he's a
salesman/manager).

I have also downloaded software from the MIT export system for
X-Windows sources using FTP and kermit to bring those files to my
otherwise isolated workstation.

Are there any words of comfort that I can give this person that is
worried that the workstation might contain software that is corrupt?

While looking into virus protection software I noticed that there are
some sites where I can FTP software from...which seems rather ironic
in light of the question I am asking :-)

Post a response or send e-mail, it doesn't matter to me.

P.S. If there is a FAQ that answers my question, please point me in
the right direction....

[Moderator's note: While the FAQ does not directly answer this
question, it is available either by e-mail or by anonymous FTP.  You
can FTP it from cert.org:pub/virus-l/FAQ.virus-l or you can request it
by e-mail - simply send mail to Listserv@Lehigh.edu containing the
text "info virus-l".  Yes, a new version of the FAQ is in the works...]

Yes, maybe I'm too lazy or I do not remember very well, but there is a
list of the most important Computer Virus Scientific Conferences for
the next year [1993, off course] ?
