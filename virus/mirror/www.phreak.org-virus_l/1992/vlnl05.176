While there is an actual Filler virus from Europe (?), we have not had
any actual reports of the virus, other than the initial disk that was
send to us.  However, it is fairly common for the Filler virus to be
reported in memory due to a conflict between VIRUSCAN (SCAN) and other
anti-viral programs if they use the same "search string" to detect the
virus but the other anti-viral program does not hide the search string
in memory by ciphering or otherwise encrypting it.

I would recommend that you check your PC to see if any other
anti-viral programs are running and if so, disable them and reboot
your system.  If the virus is no longer reported by SCAN then it is a
false alarm.

Subject: OS/2 system stopped due to virus (FAT partition)? (OS/2) (PC)

My PC has just been infected by an unknown virus (both McAfee Scan
Version 97 and CPAV failed to identify it/them). SCAN only report that
all of the hard disk boot sectors have been modified (as compared to a
CRC file created before the infection). I have both MS-DOS 5.00 and
OS/2 (with the latest CSD) installed with DOS on FAT and OS/2 on HPFS.

I just got the following message while trying to run MS-WORD for Windows 2.00a
under OS/2:
####### Start message #################
The system detected an internal processing
error at location ##0160:fff6459e - 000d:959e.

Internal revision 6.466, 92/10/15

The system is stopped. Record the location number
of the error and contact your service representative.

########## End of message ###############

I got this identical message when I try to run W4W 2.00a twice.  Can
this be caused by a virus? Note that W4W was running happily for the
last 2 days after installing the latest CSD except for minor screen
repaint problems (I have only been editing files and have not tried
anything else like printing etc).

Subject: "LARRY ON A SCREEN" Virus (PC)

This virus was first reported (to our knowledge) by Brian Mariott,
Dept of Computer Science, University of Tasmania, on Virus L, on 7th
Oct.  They received it from a computer shop, which had found it on a
PC brought in by a customer.  We received a sample on Oct 20th.

It is a resident .COM & .EXE infector, adding 491 & 507 bytes
respectively.  Like Troi2, recently reported, it hides in the 2nd half
of the interrupt table, overwriting interrupts 80 to FF, and, like
Troi 2, it frequently crashed in our tests, again presumably because
it overloads the system stack.  It has one most unusual bug; it gives
a "Write protect error writing drive .." message (and usually hangs),
if you run a program from a write protected disk - even if the file is
already infected!

The virus uses the word 'GM' (474dh) as the signature.  This is found
at offset 4 in .COM files, and at offset 12h (the checksum field) in
the .EXE header.  The message below can be seen almost at the end of
infected files.

It includes a counter (set to 19 in our sample) which is decremented
each time a program is infected.  When the counter reaches zero the
message

                          Larry on a Screen

is displayed instead of running the program.

This virus does not pose a serious threat, as it does no deliberate
damage, and is so unreliable that most users will realise something is
wrong, even before they get the message.

VET 7.06 will detect this virus, and restore infected files.  It will
also detect and repair files infected with Shifter (also recently
found in Australia), and will detect a number of viruses recently
discovered overseas.

From:    riordan.cybec@tmx.mhs.oz.au (Roger Riordan)
Subject: "SHIFTER" Virus. (PC)

We received a copy of this virus, which is believed to have been found
recently in Australia, 0n Oct 14th.  The following notes are based on
a preliminary analysis, and many parts have not been analysed in
detail.

The virus is an alternating .EXE and Master Boot Record infector, and
will only run on ATs and PCs with an 80286 or later microprocessor.
It is a complex virus, and analysis has been made more difficult by
the inclusion of many 80286 specific instructions.  It has a number of
unusual features, and several nasty tricks which will cause the user
serious inconvenience.  It claims to be destructive, but this appears
to be bluff.

When an infected file is run the virus looks for the "AT" flag in the
BIOS (FC at address FFFF:000Eh).  If this is found (and the MBR is not
already infected) the virus overwrites the original MBR, without
saving it, and writes 12 more sectors to track zero, head zero,
starting at sector three.  It also writes zeroes to bytes 34 & 35 in
the CMOS RAM.  These two bytes are subsequently used as an elapsed
time counter, which determines when the various nasty tricks come into
play.  These bytes are defined as "Reserved", and apparently are
normally unused.

The virus then disinfects the original file (whether or not it
infected the hard disk) and writes the clean version back to the
original disk.  It then loads the original program and permits it to
run normally.

When a PC with an infected hard disk is booted the virus goes
resident, reserving 7K at the top of memory, and traps Ints 8, 9, 11,
17 & 21.  Int 8 (timer tick) is used to increment the counter in CMOS
RAM each minute.  This enables various nasty tricks after different
delays.

The Int 21 handler looks for functions 30 (Get version no), 4b (Load &
execute), and 4e (Find first).  It appears that the virus only infects
files returned by 4e (Find First) and only if they are .EXE files
between 8000 & 327,680 bytes in length.  If this is correct it is a
very ineffective infection procedure.  We certainly had trouble
getting infected samples.  When a file is infected the length is
increased by (decimal) 6672 bytes.

The other interrupts are used to harrass the user.  After the virus
has been present for 10 days and 10 hours the Int 9 (keyboard) handler
will occasionally randomly either ignore keystrokes, or trigger a
RESET.

After 13 days and 13 hours Int 21, function 4b (Load & execute a
program) will sometimes cause a message stating that the hard disk is
being formatted to appear. Meanwhile random sectors are read, so that
the disk light remains on, but it appears that no damage is actually
done.

After 15 days & 15 hours Int 21, function 30 (Get DOS version) will
always return version 2.0, and this will cause many programs to abort.

VET 7.06 can detect this virus, and restore infected files.  It cannot
safely disable the virus, so it will ask the user to reboot from a
clean disk if the virus is detected in memory.  If the Master Boot
Record is infected, and VET has been previously installed for the PC,
VETHDFIX can put back the saved copy of the MBR.  Otherwise VET can
replace it with a "Plain Vanilla" boot sector.  This will normally
work perfectly, but we cannot guarantee it will work on all PCs.

Does this work?  I though you needed to reset segment registers for
the converted program to run.  If not, I can understand why the
scanners don't detect it (although they should detect as a "varient"
or "dropper".)

Subject: Syrian Brain II (PC)

	I had a call last night from a user whos machine was reporting
that whilst his executables existed in directory listings, when he
tried to run them DOS reported that it was a "Bad command or file
name", every time he ran a file from the HD, and then after that every
time he ran a file from the HD or his floppy.  After getting him to
upload the first executable that was run in his autoexec.bat from his
HD, it was easy to find a virus which had its name clearly marked out
as the Syrian Brain II virus.  I had a quick look at the virus, and
given the simplicity of the viral code (infect everything that the
user tries to run after virus hooks int 21H) and the number of errors
in the programming which would cause most of its messages to become
corrupt, I wondered if this was as the name suggests a Syrian virus,
or is it far more likely that its one made here.  Has anyone else ever
come across it?

Thus spake mybdav02@uctvax.uct.ac.za:

>H0,T0,S17 to S17.

Yes-ish.

You must boot clean first, though. This is easier said than done with
EXEbug. The virus tells your PC (by altering the CMOS setup) that it
has no floppy drive A: installed. Some BIOSes, seeing this, figure
that trying to boot from an uninstalled drive is pointless, and thus
insist upon booting from hard disc. This gets the virus executed, and
installed in memory. The virus then attempts to boot from floppy -- if
there is a bootable floppy in the drive, you then seem to enjoy a
clean boot, though the virus is already active and working.

The virus' stealth mechanisms, once resident, deflect access from
0.0.1 to 0.0.17. So, when the virus is around, the partition record
looks normal -- and the partition table looks correct. DOS, when
working out which partitions belong to it, gets everything right.
When *not* resident, 0.0.1 is pure virus code, with complete nonsense
in the partition table zone. Boot without the virus, and DOS sees no
partitions belonging to it -- ergo, no C: drive!

So, if you try to boot clean to remove EXEbug, try logging to drive C:
after bootup. If you get "Invalid drive specification", then that's
*good* news. If you can reach drive C:, it means the virus is
resident.  Go into your CMOS setup, tell the system you *do* have a
floppy drive and then instantly reboot from floppy. Only when drive C:
is "absent" should you fire up NU, DE, DISCHAK or whatever to move
0.0.17 to 0.0.1.

>Another question: the virus formats an extra sector on floppies and

With the virus in memory, you'll see the "hidden" sector when you try
to read 0.0.1 from floppy, thanks to EXEbug's stealth. So you can use
the virus to access this extra sector...but then you can't write back
over the infected 0.0.1. Try Explorer or PEEKA.

Thus spake mybdav02@uctvax.uct.ac.za:
>Recently, I have had a run-in with the so-called ExeBug virus

I see you're posting from Cape Town -- not surprising that you've had
EXEbug, because it's rapidly becoming the most common virus in South
Africa. We've had reports of people buying new PC gear that came with
the virus already present, which would help to explain its prevalence
and rapid spread. If my memory serves me right, the virus appeared in
about April 1992, near Pretoria.

I assume the /nomem switch "turns off" the virus-in-memory check.  If
so, this is extremely silly. EXEbug's stealth is such that all writes
to the partition record while the virus is resident get deflected to
its hidden copy of the "real" partition record.  You can't remove
EXEbug with conventional techniques whilst it's resident. BOOT CLEAN
BEFORE GOING VIRUS HUNTING...

Try Quaid's excellent Explorer, or Alan Solomon's PEEKA, if you wish
to look at weird sectors. On high-capacity discs, EXEbug formats an
extra track -- track 80 -- for its own use. Look for 80.0.1. On
low-cap discs, it's at 40.0.1. One serious flaw in the virus is that
it assumes that 720KB stiffies have 40 tracks (0..39), rather than 80,
and formats its "extra" track at 40.0, obliterating anything that was
there before!

DISKEDIT is a "clever" program, which knows the geometry of specific
mdeia. When you ask it to read a particular physical sector, it pops
up an input form asking you to enter the track, head and sector you
wish to look at -- and helpfully performs validation on your input.
So, you can't ask to look at track 40 of a 360KB disc-- DISKEDIT is
"intelligent" enough to know that your "40" is erroneous!

I have come across the Phalcon/Skism Mass-Produced Code Generator.
Here is a bit of info on what it can do.

 1) like VCL in design but no IDE.
 2) Over 150 encryption techniques.
 3) Creates compact commented code (ASM)
 4) COM/EXE infections, option to exclude command.com
 5) Both Resident and non-resident viruses
 6) Two type of traversal for non-resident viruses
 7) Three types of high memory residency routines for TSR's
 8) Optinal Critical error handling routines (external)
 9) variable activation dates

So far the creation rate is about 80% (only small modifications to the
20%) There is now destructive code in the generator, but anyone with
simple ASM knowledge can add them.

Q: does McAFEE, for Frisk, have a scan string for the viruses made buy

Subject: Denning Key Registration Virus

I think we are witnessing the first virus that doesn't require any
special code to operate.  Just look at the sci.crypt forum.  After
Dorothy Denning's talk at the last NCSC conference about registering
crypto keys with the goverment, there has been a tremendous response
(mostly angry) on sci.crypt; the other day I checked the forum and
there were 450 new postings since a day or two previous.  Now postings
are starting to be cross posted to the risks and privacy forums.

This is sort of like the IBM XMAS virus, but it doesn't take any code.
All you have to do is post a highly controversial item on a well-read
forum, and wait for the responses to bring the network to its knees.

In December of 1987 IBM mainframe computers in Europe, connected via
the EARN network, experienced a "mailstorm".  Such events are fairly
common on the "internetworks", caused by mailer problems,
incompatibilities, or even "autoanswer" daemons replying to messages
from unmoderated "distribution lists".  This particular mailstorm,
however, was of unprecedented severity.  It shut down whole sections
of the net, at least as far as effective work was concerned.
 
For many, probably for most, users, email is simply text.  A select
group are involved with the exchange of programs or other binary
files, often UU or XXencoded and sent through email systems, and
often "imbedded" within messages as a greater or lesser portion. 
Some users have these facilities provided for them, through systems
that are configured with these functions.  (NeXT users have these
functions in automated form, for example, and also have a reputation
for not knowing how they work, cross-posting incomprehensible
garbage to distribution lists and newsgroups.)  IBM mainframe users
often have such functions provided through PROFS and an interpreter
language called REXX.  Programs in REXX are called EXECs.
 
The CHRISTMA EXEC was a message that contained such a program. 
"Christmas card" messages with this system can be more than just the
usual "ASCII tree".  (Perhaps, since this deals with IBM mainframes,
I should use the more generic "typewriter picture".  Anybody
remember what a typewriter was?  :-)  These messages could include
forms of animation such as asterisk snowflakes falling on a winter
scene, or a crackling fire from a yule log.  The message header
contained a note that "Browsing this message is no fun at all.  Just
type Christmas .." which was intended to stop people from trying to
read the "source code" of the message, but it is unlikely that few
would even think to do so.
 
Typing either "Christmas" or "Christma" would generate the "card". 
It really wasn't anything special, a very simplistic conifer shape
made out of "X"s.  (Mine is *way* better  :-)  At least on the
surface.  However, at the same time that it was displaying the tree
on the screen, it was also searching for the NAMES and NETLOG files
associated with the user's account.  This provided a list of other
users that either sent mail to or received mail from this account. 
The important thing was that it was a list of valid email addresses. 
The CHRISTMA EXEC would then mail copies of itself to all of these
accounts.
 
The important point, technically, was that all of the accounts were
valid.  As a side benefit, all of those accounts would be used to
receiving mail from the account that had just read it.  And they
would tell 40 friends, and they would tell ...
