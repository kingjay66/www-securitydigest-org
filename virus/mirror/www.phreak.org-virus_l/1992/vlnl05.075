Subject: Naming questions (PC)

  Well, after having 1 virus identified as 4 different viruses ( and
I'm only using 3 scanners! ), I have to ask if anyone has a virus
scanner name cross reference?
  In a related question, I have a Dark Avenger virus that the VSUM
listing describes as being either variant C or D.  How do I tell the
difference?
  Is there a 'central clearing house' for virus names yet?

This is IBM's graphic to inform you that your system has failed the
power-on self test (POST) somehow. If this happens, put in your
Reference Disk and press the F1 key. If the error is minor enough, the
system will usually boot and the reference disk will tell you what
went wrong. If more serious, you may not be able to boot. Since the
problem is intermittent, now is the time to deal with it. But it's not
a virus, just a normal part of IBM's system software.

McAfee's ViruScan 8.3V86B has a bug in it (or more correctly, an error in
the scanning strings) which causes it to identify the "Stoned" virus as
"No-Int Virus [Stoned]."  Also, when CleanUp is removing this virus, it
reports "Found No-Int Virus [Stoned]" and "Found Stoned Related Virus
[Stoned]" both, but only "1 virus removed."  This has been reported to
McAfee Associates.  I don't know how SCAN, CLEAN, or VSHIELD 86B treat the
REAL "No-Int" virus, since I don't have a copy of it.  You can use a disk
editor (Norton, PC-Tools, etc.) to look at an infected boot sector to see
which virus it actually is -- "Stoned" will have "Your PC is now Stoned!
LEGALISE MARIJUANA!" or something close, but "No-Int" will not.

"Stoned" and "No-Int" infect a PC's hard disk when a machine is booted
from an infected floppy, either intentionally or accidentally, and
regardless of whether the floppy is completely bootable or not.  Once
there, it will be loaded on every boot from the hard disk, become resident
in memory, and reduce "total bytes memory" (as reported by CHKDSK) by 2048
bytes.  From there, it will infect EVERY floppy accessed in the A: drive,
even by doing so little as a DIR A:.  "Stoned" has no activation date or
intentionally destructive payload, though it can, by the way it infects
disks, can cause damage, ranging from lost files to a corrupted FAT,
depending on the system, diskette density, and hard disk format.  "No-Int"
is less likely to damage a high-density diskette, but it does have a
simple stealth capability -- it prevents access to the boot sector when
it's in memory.

To clean the virus from the hard disk, you must first boot from a known
clean boot floppy, then remove the virus from the drive.  Often, a
recurring infection will result from attempting to remove the virus from
the hard drive without first booting from a clean floppy, or from not
cleaning ALL of the associated floppies.  Remember, it takes only ONE
infected floppy to start it back up again.  If it had overwritten part
of the directory, you may be able to use CHKDSK /F to recover those
files which had their directory entries wiped out by the real boot sector.
If it had overwritten part of the FAT, good luck.  Most likely only a
person very experienced at disk recovery or a restoration from a complete
backup can help.

As for why VSHIELD won't recognize it in Mr. Hogan's case, I don't know.
Since the scan strings for SCAN and CLEAN are faulty, it's possible that
the strings for VSHIELD are faulty, too.  It may also be possible that
the strings these programs use were accidentally matched to the "Stoned"
virus, and Mr. Hogan has the REAL "No-Int" virus.  Aryeh, do you have an
idea on this?

I have not observed the identification problem Mr. Hama reports, that
SCAN 86B mislabels "Michelangelo" as "No-Int."  SCAN 86B identified
"Michelangelo" as "Michelangelo Virus [Mich]" for me, and CLEAN 86B
successfully cleaned it.  Perhaps there is another strain of
"Michelangelo," or Mr. Hama's copy of "Michelangelo" was damaged in such
a way to cause the misidentification.

"Michelangelo" is not a strain of "Stoned," because it is too different,
but it is close enough for analysts to say that it may be a poorly hacked
version of "Stoned."

> Maybe Stoned/No-Int is corrupted.  Can I get my money back?

"Stoned" and "No-Int" are distributed on an as-is basis.  No warranties
are either expressed or implied.  However, the authors SHOULD be held
responsible for any damage resulting from the use of these programs. ;-)

Do you really think so ?  I would have thought that copies of
Michelangelo, aside from captive copies, would be few and far between
after March 6th.  Either:

   --- found and erradicated before March 6th (largely thanks to all
       the media attention)
   --- or self destructed when it activated on march 6th.
       (If Michelangelo doesn't kill itself on March 6th, it certainly
       draws attention to itself...)

Subject: Dir-II virus (PC)

     I have a user that came in with a hard drive infected by the
DIR-II virus.  He claims that VSCAN does not detect it, but F-PROT
does, although F-PROT will not remove it.  Since it is his home
machine I cannot verify this, so my question is: How should he go
about removing the virus?  I'm hoping that there is a solution other
than reformatting the hard drive.  Thanks.

Actually, there is but not in the Brain-Dead DR-DOS version of
SuperStor.  The *real* distribution (I have v1.3h but 2.0 is out now)
from Addstor includes an effective but very slow defragmenter and a
"repair" utility that seems to work well (fixed a couple of problems I
created) in the included "SSUTIL" program.

With the DR-DOS 6.0 version (1.06 fixes some earlier problems), a
"DISKOPT" program is included but is definately not a defragmenter.
Until I bought the $39 upgrade, the disks were getting slower and
slower...  After using the 1.3h defrag utility, the speed was
restored. There really is a difference and near 120 MB out of my
obsolete ST-251-1 and ST-225 is *almost* enough.

Having two effective competitiors is the best way to get technology
improvements going.

You might want to look at the DOS copyright before doing this.  Unlike
the Mac operating system, which is copyable, DOS is commercial
software, packaged and sold separately from the hardware.
Distributing it in this manner is most likely illegal.

Subject: Re: Which Package is Best? (PC) (Clarification)

  Yesterday I posted a contribution on "Which Package is Best", but
when I read the published result today, I discovered that a couple of
important words had been omitted.  So (hopefully) before someone at-
tacks what appeared there, allow me to make the following clarifica-
tion:

  My criterion (end of second paragraph after first quotation) was not
use of the fastest mode per se, but use of the fastest *practically
secure* mode.  Of course, that criterion is subject to the objection
that it is by no means clear when a given algorithm is "practically
secure" (e.g. if I were to claim that IM's "quick update" is not
practically secure while UT's is, I'm sure Wolfgang would jump all
over me).  So I would now prefer to simply concede to Donny and
Wolfgang that I should have omitted the claim that UT is faster than
IM.  The points I was/am trying to make were: (1) my abridgment of
the original three timings to the two quickest ones was in accordance
with the above criterion (given my ignorance of the existence of IM's
quick check and my belief that UT's quick check is practically secure)
and (2) whatever weakness there may be in the criterion, I don't think
it's correct to say that it's intrinsically *unfair*.

F-prot is making a false identification. F-prot 2.02d calls my sample

Bros is not an alternate name - it is a differnt virus.

older versions of f-prot (i just tried 1.16) correctly identify it as

Yes, but there's also a risk that viruses will escape undetected. It
isn't an easy problem to answer, since most people quickly get put off
by false positives, and people trying to encourage others in their
organisation to use anti-virus measures (or trying to sell such
programs) have to pass more stringent acceptance tests than the
viruses!

What is the solution? Maybe after time the rate of false positives
from heuristic scanners will be as low as conventional ones -
providing they are given the chance to evolve, of course.  But even
that might not be good enough. There seems to be a lack of tolerance
of one or two false positives (from heuristic techniques or from plain
string scanners), which is understandable, but a problem.

A better solution is AI scanners (perhaps not the best term, though).
Instead of looking for fragments of known viruses (with all the
problems that entails), or looking for "things viruses tend to do", it
is possible for a program to look at a boot sector and categorically
say if it is a genuine DOS boot sector or a virus. It is a bit harder
on hard disks, where there are all manner of utilities (like asking
which partition to boot from) available, but still at least
theoretically possible.  Unfortunately, I doubt if such a program
could tell if an average executable is a virus or not, since (for one
thing) you don't know exactly what the program is supposed to do.
(Grander discussions may bring in Turing's halting problem and so
forth, for my bit, I'll just say I'm only running a 25MHz 386 and
leave it at that!)

I'm not sure if people are talking of heuristic methods and "generic
disinfectors" as being part of the "next generation" or anti-viral
software. If so, then AI (what's a better description?) should be the
generation after that.  I'd still back good heuristic methods as being
right a VERY high percentage of the time with boot sector infectors,
but nothing can compare with a solid yes/no answer which the
generation after that can give. I might be sounding too optimistic
about the capabilities of such software... if anyone is interested
feel free to e-mail me. Obviously it is hard to explain everything
about it here.  A quick summary would be: if the boot sector is
supposed to do particular things, and not others, and occupy a
particular spot, then trace it through, and see what it does do.  If
it departs from the specifications nail it, if possible saying what it
does do.  It is a lot like what a person does when properly
reverse-engineering a virus. It is possible (I know it is, since I've
partially done it!) to get a program to work out what register
contents are when an interrupt is called, etc.  So *how* teh program
does what it does doesb't matter; it can use a far jump at the start,
it can be self-modifying, etc.  But if it stays in memory, writes to a
disk, changes vectors, etc...!

Disinfectant 2.7.1

March 25, 1992

Disinfectant 2.7.1 is a new release of our free Macintosh anti-viral
utility.

Version 2.7.1 corrects a stupid mistake in version 2.7 which could cause
crashes during or after disk scans.

The only change in version 2.7.1 is to the Disinfectant program itself.
The version 2.7.1 protection INIT is identical to the version 2.7 INIT,
except for the new version number. You should go ahead and install the
2.7.1 INIT anyway, to avoid the alert the program presents telling you
that "an old version is installed."

My thanks to the dozen or so people who promptly reported the problem
with version 2.7 and were kind enough to test the fix for me.

[A note to Mac C programmers: Assigning a pointer to a Boolean variable
is rarely useful. Releasing your own CODE resources is also a bad thing
to do.]

The rest of this announcement is a slightly edited copy of the version
2.7 announcement.

Version 2.7.1 detects the new INIT 1984 virus.

The INIT 1984 virus was discovered in the Netherlands and in several
locations in the USA in March, 1992.

INIT 1984 is a malicious virus. It is designed to trigger if an infected
system is restarted on any Friday the 13th in 1991 or later years. The
virus damages a large number of folders and files. File and folder names
are changed to random 1-8 character strings. File creators and file types
are changed to random 4 character strings. This changes the icons
associated with the files and destroys the relationships between programs
and their documents. Creation and modification dates are changed to
Jan. 1, 1904. In addition, the virus can delete a small percentage (<2%)
of files.

The virus caused significant damage to the hard drives of several users
on Friday, March 13, 1992. Because only a relatively small number of
reports of damage were received, we hope that the virus is not widespread.

The virus only infects INITs (also known as startup documents or system
extensions). It does not infect the System file, desktop files, control
panel files, applications, or document files. Because INIT files are
shared less frequently than are programs, the INIT 1984 virus does not
spread as rapidly as most other viruses.

The virus spreads from INIT to INIT at startup time.

The virus affects all types of Macintoshes. It spreads and causes damage
under both System 6 and System 7. On very old Macintoshes (the Mac 128K,
512K, and XL), the virus will cause a crash at startup.

If you have an INIT file which is infected by the INIT 1984 virus, when
the virus attacks during startup, the Disinfectant 2.7.1 INIT beeps ten
times, and an alert is presented at the end of the startup sequence. The
virus is neutralized and does not spread or cause any damage, but the
non-viral part of the infected INIT runs as usual.

In order to properly detect and block the INIT 1984 virus, we had to make
an important change to the way the Disinfectant protection INIT works.

In previous versions of Disinfectant, the protection INIT always had to
load last. Under System 7, the protection INIT had to be located in the
System folder proper, not in the Extensions folder.

These rules have been turned upside down.

Starting with version 2.7, the protection INIT now must load first, before
any other INITs. Under System 7, the protection INIT must be located in
the Extensions folder, not in the System folder proper.

The "Install Protection INIT" command in version 2.7.1 installs the new
protection INIT in the proper location.

When version 2.7.1 is run, it checks to see if an older version of the
protection INIT has been installed in either the System folder or the
Extensions folder. If it locates such an older version, it presents an
alert asking if you want to install the new version. If you click on the
"Install" button, the old version is removed and the new version is
installed.

In previous versions, several users reported "Unexpected error -194"
errors when trying to install or save the protection INIT. We were finally
able to reproduce this problem and find its cause. Version 2.7.1 fixes the
error.

Many users have had problems trying to build a System 6 Virus Tools disk
because they could not fit System, Finder, and Disinfectant on a single
800K floppy. We now recommend building this disk without a copy of Finder
and making Disinfectant the startup program. This should solve the problem.
See the "Quick Start" section of the 2.7.1 online manual for details.

We have added a new "Known Problems" section to the document. This section
lists in one location all of the known problems with Disinfectant and all
of the known incompatibilities between Disinfectant and other software.

Disinfectant 2.7.1 is available now via anonymous FTP from site
ftp.acns.nwu.edu [129.105.113.52].  It will also be available soon on
sumex-aim.stanford.edu, rascal.ics.utexas.edu, comp.binaries.mac,
America Online, CompuServe, GEnie, Delphi, BIX, MacNet, Calvacom,
AppleLink, and other popular sources of free and shareware software.

Macintosh users who do not have access to electronic sources of free and
shareware software may obtain a copy of Disinfectant by sending a self-
addressed stamped envelope and an 800K floppy disk to the author at the
address given below. People outside the US may send an international postal

reply coupon instead of US stamps (available from any post office). Please
use sturdy envelopes, preferably cardboard disk mailers.

People in Western Europe may obtain a copy of the latest version of
Disinfectant by sending a self-addressed disk mailer and an 800K floppy
disk to macclub benelux. Stamps are not required. The address is:

Actually, there should *not* be a low-level way to achieve this.  More
specifically, if the network-server software is well-written,
*nothing* that a client machine can send to it across the wire
(regardless of whether that client is running DOS or any other
operating system) should be able to cause alterations in files on the
server that that client is not authorized to alter.

This is the great advantage of having important files on a server:
whereas a typical single-user micro operating system offers no real
protection to a user against nefarious actions of a program that she
runs (any program running on the machine can alter any file on the
machine), a network server can and should provide *unbeatable*
protection to the files it owns.  Since a program on a client machine
can do no more than send bits to the server across the LAN, the
program that processes those bits has complete control over what
happens at the server end.  There's no equivalent of "bypassing DOS"
or "talking directly to the disk controller" when you're dealing with
files on a network server.

Of course, I don't know whether the particular systems mentioned, or
any other brands of server software, are in fact free of holes or back
doors.  But the key point is that true protection *is* possible in
this environment...

I've noticed that some software agreements have prohibitions on
reverse engineering.  How does this affect people looking at a program
to see if it has a virus, or using a program that contains heuristic
or AI techniques to do pretty much the same thing??

No, not really. The Amiga is a recent machine and virus writing
couldn't have started on that. I recall coming across the LOAD RUNNER
virus on the Apple II in the early eighties.

Writing-up of self-replicating/destruction code has been a hobby of
*some* programmers for a long time. In the early seventies, software
programmers at NASA used to play a game called COREWARS where each
player can write some viral code in assembly language and then release
it in a specified area of memory, to fight against similar programs
released by other players. The winner was the owner of the process
filling-up the whole area of memory, thus killing all other processes.

There are a number of COREWARS simulators available on the PC, each
with its own little assembly code (called REDCODE). Once you have
written your "warrior", you can test it against other warriors from
other players.  Since you see a map of the memory, it's fun to see how
your code can replicate, avoid traps, and kill other programs.
COREWARS is actually available from anonymous FTP (check-out
wsmr-simtel20 & mirrors), and I wish that potential virus-writers
would play around with that instead of doing it for real.

Subject: CRCs- How do they work?

I have a question regarding the popular use of CRCs to guarantee file
integrity and even help restore damaged files.

In my understanding CRCs add up the bytes of a file with certain
significance added to each byte (very fuzzy here).  The question is,
if a CRC can guarantee unique files with one whatever-byte number, why
cant the file just be stored as its CRC?  If not, I suspect that it
WOULD be possible to get two files with the same CRC...and if this is
the case, how can anyone be sure when they restore a damaged file
through the use of a CRC?  I'm sure that if PART of the file were
damaged, the CRC could fill in the blanks, because the other proposed
file with the same CRC would probably be radically different.  Where
am I right and where am I completely lost in this post?
					Thanks for any replies,

greets all,

I have decided to do a persuasive speech on the importance of computer
virus awareness. I generally want to show that computer viruses affect
everyone in some way or another. If anyone has any info which may help
me with this please send E-mail.  Also, as viruses have implications
in computer security, I will also touch on this subject. Any info
appreciated.

Please, tell us who these people are.  I'm sure many virus authors are
known.  Let's expose them, and treat them to the scorn and derision
they deserve.  And, where appropriate, let the victims band together
and sue the originators for the damage they have caused.  As long as
the perpetrators go unpunished, or worse, are treated as folk heros,
there will be no end to these problems.
