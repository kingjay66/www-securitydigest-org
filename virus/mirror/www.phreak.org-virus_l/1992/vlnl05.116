Not if the afore mentioned virus is a new one which the scanner does not
yet detect.  In that case, you're in big trouble.  Note that this is not
merely a problem with McAfee's scanner, but with any; also note that the
memory check is a excellent idea, it just isn't perfect.

But then again, what is?

Subject: Screaming Fist-696 analysis (PC)

   Hello everyone,

We have analyzed the polymorphic (semi-poly :-)) variant of the
Screaming Fist (696) virus. It should be mentioned that the virus is
simply encryptive, and therefore, the decryptor can be used as a scan
string to search for the virus in both COM and EXE files. It uses a
16-byte XOR-type decryption routine with a variable key (obtained from
BIOS timer area 0:046c), and one instruction is modified to be either
an INC AX or a DEC AX. It is a fast infector, but not stealth;
therefore, it is advisable to boot from a clean floppy before
scanning. McAfee's SCAN 91 does recognize it [Scr-2], though F-PROT
2.03a does NOT.  If you add the given signature to F-PROT, make sure
you use SECURE scan, otherwise, it will be missed. Heuristic scan
flags it as a possible virus.  We have used DIS86 by Mr. James Zandt
(available at Simtel archives under /msdos/disasm/dis86212.zip) to
analyze it. Here are the details:

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Suggested Name: Screaming Fist-696-pm
Date/Location : May 1992, USA
Scan string   : 5d 8b f5 56 b0 ?? b9 a3 02 (40 or 48) 2e 30 04 46 e2 f9 c3
Damage trigger: None
Payload       : None
Interrupts    : 21h & 24h
hooked          21h is hooked using direct memory reference to IVT, but
                Int 24h is hooked in a standard manner using DOS 25h/35h
                subfunctions of Int 21h.
Peculiarity   : Reduces BIOS base memory indicator (0:0413) by 2 just like
                an MBR/BR virus, though it is a file infector type. So,
                CHKDSK will report 2K less of base memory size.
Targets       : COM and EXE files when FILE OPEN (3d), RENAME (56),
                LOAD/EXEC (4b), GET/SET ATTRIB (43) services are requested.
                It will infect C:\COMMAND.COM after the first time it goes
                resident by issuing a file open call with mode set to FF,
                which is an invalid open mode value. Only the copy of
                COMMAND.COM in the root directory is infected.
                COM files are appended at the end, EXE files are modified
                by changing the header to point to virus. The COM
                files are always increased by 696 bytes, but EXE files
                depend on what the victim has in the header.
                COM files less than 300 bytes or greater than 64000 bytes
                will not be infected.

RU-there call : mov  AX, 0FFFFh
                int  21h
                or   AX, AX
                jz   virus_is_resident

        In English: The virus extends INT 21h services by setting up a
                    handler which responds to a request FFFF with a 0000
                    in AX register.

Comments  : This is an encryptive virus that uses BIOS timer value (1 byte
            at 0:046c), and either INC AX or DEC AX in the decryption
            routine. The virus is not encrypted in memory. The decryptor
            is 16 bytes long, and it is located at the end of infected
            files.
            It appears to be a research virus in that it includes no
            damage trigger, and it is fairly bug-free! It is a resident
            COM/EXE file infector that does nothing but replicates.
            It uses handle-oriented file access routines, and does NOT
            implement stealth to evade detection.
            The virus INT 21h handler offset is always 0088 in memory.
            Inside the virus there is a text which reads:

               Screaming Fist

            therefore, the name.
            The virus determines if a program is infected as follows:
            For COM-type files:
               if the fourth byte of the file plus 1 is equal to thevirus will
infect
            C:\COMMAND.COM and return control over to the host program.
            From then on, it monitors INT 21h services (see above).
            File extension as well as 'MZ' signature is checked before
            infection. Decoys can be used to capture the virus easily.

Vesselin you are over looking the fact that there are already 2
versions of MtE in circulation, one ('0.92' I think) is found on
"Dedicated" & "Fear" and the other ('0.90') is on "Pogue".  I have
only looked at the one on "Pogue" so far, and around 20% of the files
I infected were corrupt.

These corrupt files usually crash when executed, sometimes with video
effects as display memory is overwritten and sometimes the crash was
postponed until a subsequent program was executed.  This seems to
coincide closely with Glenn Jordan's description.

To generate infected files with out crashing the PC (as happens when
infecting at execution time), I simply had a batch file which copied
each new host file to NULL.

IMHO not often enough!  This feature means that a proportion of
infected files will not have the polymorphic endowments of MtE, and
established more reliable detection methods can cope with these in the
same way as any other virus.  Given an infected hard drive the
presence of same copies of the virus in this form will give
reassurance that the virus is known, rather than something new hiding
under the MtE cloak.

If the MtE detection tests that you are performing are going to be of
relevance you will need to test for the variations produced by "Pogue"
as well.

Subject: New virus? (PC)

   One of the Managers here has a virus on his home computer. I
haven't been keeping up on my reading for all the VIRUS-L since at
least May. If I may post some of the symptoms he is experiencing and
hopefully, it hasn't been a hot subject over the past month someone
will know what it is or isn't (like a virus :-) ).
   He has harddrives C thru G. When he executes a program, the system
hangs and after rebooting the exe module is gone. This only happens
when he tries to executes a module. Also, he starts getting bad
clusters. when he uses PC Tools and changes these bad clusters to
files and then looks at them, he finds his lost modules. After
cleaning up these clusters and trying to figure what is wrong he will
create new bad clusters which contain his EXE's.
  Using Scan 86 revealed no virus. He then used CPAV with no virus,
then he used FPROT203 which said he had a virus. He knew that the use
of CPAV produces false positives so he rebooted and reran FPROT203
which showed no virus.
  I will write up a better description of what he is experiencing and
what EXE's he is running that get converted to bad clusters. I wanted
to get this out right away. I also gave him a copy of scan89b and
asked him to run it after booting from a write-protected disk. If
anyone has any ideas, please let me know, as you usually do.

Has anyone used, and can anyone comment on the VET anti-virus

the standard places, and I don't recall seeing any mention of

Only because it's hard to do just what the degarbler would have done,
when the degarbler can be any one of zillions.  You'd have to write a
subset-interpreter for the chip, which (while useful for various
purposes) is a pain, and doesn't tend to be fast.  Any good hacker, of
course, will be able to recover a few critical files manually, but
replacement is much safer.  That's true of just the plain old
Jerusalem, too, though!  Nothing too new there...

If you trust your scanner (and I'm sure we'll have trustable scanners
for the MtE before long; probably before there are any MtE viruses
bothering real users), you only have to remove and replace the
*infected* executables.  Which is probably what you meant, but I
thought I'd make the point explicitly...

Subject: "Menem's Revenge" virus (Amiga)

The following is lifted from the news pages of the British mag "Just Amiga
Monthly" (JAM), which I received yesterday.  I am unable to confirm the
accuracy of this material, and the Metropolitan Police Computer Crime Unit
(London) didn't mention it to me when I spoke to them recently.

+   FRESH WARNINGS AS NEW VIRUS SPREADS
+
+   A new Amiga virus called Menem's Revenge is sweeping the country.
+
+   It is a particularly nasty file or 'link' virus that starts a task
+   called a single space.  This task's sole job is to patch the LoadSeg
+   vector in DOS.  It thus infects programs that are run.
+
+   It is triggered through the Amiga's internal time clock will write its
+   messages to files on DH0: and/or DF0:.  The message it writes and then
+   displays as an alert is "Menem's Revenge has arrived / Argentina still
+   alive".
+
+   Because it can write to executable files, those files may very well
+   crash, or not run at all, after being infected.  Menem's Revenge adds
+   3,076 bytes to each file it infects.

The news item recommends the use of Virus_Checker as protection from this
virus, and as it advertises version 6.05 on a JAM disk later in the magazine
I presume you should use at least that version.

While not, in the very strictest sense, a virus, the CHRISTMA EXEC of

While no data was at risk, CHRISTMA resulted in denial of service and

Subject: re: Mainframe viruses (was: MVS Virii)

"Tim Hare" <SS942TH@DOT1.MAIL.UFL.EDU> (in a posting that's been
sitting in my mailbox for quite awhile) asks about mainframe viruses,
trojan horses, and the like.  Such programs certainly exist, and a few
(the CHRISTMA EXEC for VM/CMS/RSCS, for instance) have become briefly
widespread.  In general, though, we have not seen any viruses become
endemic in the mainframe area the way we have on all popular
microcomputers.  The reasons for this are partly technical and partly
cultural.  Viruses don't become widespread unless they can spread
faster than they are caught.  Access controls help to slow spread
(although I would claim that the access controls that separate my PC
from your PC are as strong as any mainframe access controls that
separate one userid from another!).  But at least as importantly,
there are many fewer people at this moment walking around with 9-track
tapes reels in their back pockets than there are people with
diskettes.  The micro world is just a more tightly-connected graph
(and it has many more nodes) than is the mainframe world.  Someone
could write a mainframe virus (as Cohen has shown, this is technically
possible on, roughly, any general-purpose computer), but it'd be
unlikely to get anywhere before going extinct.

Taxonomy was originally based on the biologists' intuitive ideas about
organism relationships too, but algorithms for describing and
systematizing these intuitions still proved useful.

I agree, however, that it will be very hard to do anything mechanical
about classifying viruses.  It was hard for biologists, and a
biological organism is easier to get a grip on than a computer virus.

Subject: Polymorphic Virii

I appreciate the discussion on polymorphic viruses. One of the users
suggested moving the discussion to E-Mail. I would prefer that you
didn't because I feel that the subject of Polymorphism is very
pertinent. We are going to have to understand them to combat those
types of viruses.

Subject: Re: BAD IDEA (was: Where can I find Virus signatures?)

Zmudzinski recently replied to a query on this bulletin board by
saying to the enquirer that "if you haven't already got a collection
of virus signatures then you aren't a legitimate researcher".  I think
this is a olish view that smacks of a guild memtality.

Those in the business of producing anti-viral software obviously have
little difficulty in acquiring new viruses. Others, like me, who have
an academic research interest in virus algorithms,always seem to have
an impossible time obtaining copies of new viruses.  I have had to
rely on the high turn-over of foreign students in our department
(mostly from Indonesia and Pakistan) to bring infected discs with
them.  I always check their discs before they can use them in a
Department machine, and I trade them a clean disc for their infected
ones.  It has been an extremely slow and tedious process obtaining the
viruses this way, and could have been made a hell of a lot easier if
some of the other people working in the field had been willing to
share their knowledge.  Also, with the number of bulletin boards open
to virus-producers, its about time that those of us of the other side
of the line began being a little bit more free in sharing what we've
learned.

Subject: Misinformation does more damage than viruses themselves

Unfortunately misinformation about viruses still does more damage than
the viruses itself. The following article appeared in the Dutch
magazine 'Computable' dd. june 5 1992:

"Professional computer users underestimate the threat of computer
viruses, that are no longer exclusively spread by illegal games and
bulletin boards.

This conclusion was made by the Pilotteam Computer Criminality of the
Dutch police in a report about the Michelangelo virus.

[...] "

The article continues with conclusions that almost nobody of the users
hit by the virus had a backup to fall back on.

It's sad to see the police, and especially the special Pilotteam who
really should know better, spread such misinformation. I've attened
several lectures of the chief of that team, H. Onderwater recently, and
his stories consist mostly of popular folklore and fables about
hackers, which seem to have originated from 'Wargames' and the press
reports of the German CCC. He continues to spread the fables of hackers
being able to increase their bank account and highschool grades, that
every hacker supports the CCC 'freedom of information for all' policy,
and is out to view your hospital data. He also claims many companies
prefer to employ hackers, even though not a single case of this claim
is known.

The story of viruses being spread only by hobbyists via bulletion
boards and cracked games is a very persistent one. It is a very popular
theory because it allows companies to ban use of all games and public
domain software to prevent viruses. They then rely on this policy as
sole protection, just like an ostrich sticks his head in the sand. If a
virus does show up, it is blamed on some employee who brought in a game
or public domain software.

Recent discoveries of viruses in shrink-wrapped software and demo disks
has proved relying on the assumption of viruses spread by games and
BBSes is a big risk, which leads to a false sense of security.
Unfortunately companies are more interested in formal policies than
practical security. Unless this attitude changes, false information and
virus panic will cause more damage than the occasional virus itself.

Subject: F-PROT 2.04 (PC)

Version 2.04 - major changes:

   The program can now scan into DIET-compressed files

   Variant identification is now even more accurate than before - in
   particular regarding EXE-infecting viruses.

   The disinfection capabilities have been improved somewhat - the
   program can now disinfect several viruses which were only detected in
   previous versions.

   The program is now faster than before - for example the scanning speed
   on our primary development machine went from 23 files/sec to 40
   files/sec, but the relative speed increase might be even greater on
   slower machines.

Version 2.04 - corrections:

   The heuristic analysis produced a false alarm on a program named
   DDIR.COM, (C) Charles Petzold - fixed.

   The scanner reported some versions of 123.COM as "Possibly infected
   with a new version of Frogs" - fixed.

   The program only detected around 99.86% of MtE encrypted files - this
   should be fixed now.

   OPTLINK-packed programs, such as the Norton Utilities are no longer
   flagged as packed in heuristic analysis.  The programs are actually
   packed, but users were not aware of that, which has caused considerable
   confusion.

Version 2.04 - minor improvements:

   The following command-line switches have been added:

       /APPEND - used with /REPORT. Append to an existing file.
       /NOBREAK command line switch added - disables ESC during scanning
       /NOWRAP - do not wrap text in the report.

Version 2.04 - new viruses:

   The following 72 new viruses can now be detected and removed.
