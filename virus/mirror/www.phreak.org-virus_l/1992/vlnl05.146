Subject: LANs & Viruses (PC)

I have received word that our test LAN is ready for experimentation &
will commence tomorrow. Before I get into that, I would like to make
some comments about Netware (R) in general.

1) It is possible to protect a LAN server from viruses using only
   the capabilities built into the LAN.

2) The methodology is somewhat obscure and may impact the way the
   users are accustomed to having the LAN operate.

3) Access to files is controlled by "rights" and may be assigned
   to users, groups, volumes, directories, and files.

4) Rights may be tranferred and "inherited" in certain ways.

5) Rights granted at one level can often override a lack of rights
   at another.

6) Out of 256 possible combinations of file rights (SRWCEMFA) alone,
   240 will permit viral attacks. The sixteen remaining combinations
   can be subverted by rights granted at other levels.

					Warmly,

First I should remind/explain that MS-DOS supports two executable file
formats, (omitting batch files from this discussion).  These are known
as 'COM' and 'EXE' formats, often the format used is reflected by the
filename extension, but this is not necessarily the case.

The infection function of Vacsina viruses recognises 'COM' format files
and will infect them when they are found.  Some of the early variants
infect 'EXE' files in two passes, when they are first encountered the
virus modifies them to become 'COM' format files.  So when the file is
encountered on another occasion the infection will be completed.

CHKDSK.EXE is in this state where it has been converted to a 'COM' file,
but the second stage of infection hasn't occurred.

> Is it important that one utility recognised CHKDSK while the other did not?

Yes, 'EXE' files modified in this way may be corrupted and either fail to
work or work incorrectly.  This includes a number of programs that
use overlays or include configuration information in the executable file.
Software that misses these files may leave continuing problems, and resolving
these will be difficult if you believe that the virus has been removed.

Take a look at the Virus Bulletin Feb 1992, product review on page 24
by Keith Jackson.

FYI: The conclusion reads - ( I quote verbatim)
________________________________________________________________________
CONCLUSIONS

ViruGuard can detect viruses. It can do this before execution commences
for about 50% of viruses. It can detect over 90% of viruses when infected
files are allowed to execute, However, the vendor's original claim that
"ViruGuard traps all present and future viruses" is shown to be untrue.

Not quite true: a PC canot *execute* a program in the CMOS memory but
it can be read and written to with proper assembly language
statements.  Consequently, CMOS can be corrupted by a PC virus that is
executing (Azusa is the most common example).

Since PC and XT class machines did not come with any CMOS memory and
the amount of CMOS memory can be as little as 32 bytes, nearly all of
which is used, and different BIOSes use the CMOS memory differently,
it is not even a good place for a virus to store data.

For the hysterically minded, CMOS memory (actually battery backed RAM)
is a byproduct of the Motorola MC146818 (or eq.) Real Time Clock chip.
Back in pre-AT times, people had to set the clock every time the
system booted (even DOS 5.0 will ask if you want to set it if no
AUTOEXEC.BAT if found on boot). Consequently, one of the first
peripheral cards was a clock/calendar containing this chip.

So that an accurate date could be maintained, the clock had to
continue to run and the date/time stored even though the computer was
turned off.  Consequently, these cards also contained a battery to
keep the clock running. Since the chip was constantly powered it also
contained a small amount of RAM for storing the date. So that the
clock could be read and set it contained read/write logic accessable
from the CPU.

The name, CMOS, stands for Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor - a
chip manufcturing process that runs on exceptionally low power,
necessary for the original batteries to have a decent life - today
most batteries are rechargable lithium units that can last for several
years so long as the PC is used regularly.

Quickly, manufacturers found out that only a small part of the RAM was
needed for the clock (10 bytes) leaving quite a bit for "other"
activities.  First exploited by the IBM AT (Advanced Technology) it
can be used for many things. Just not viruses.

I fear, this name has already been given to another virus (cf. the
above quote from an old VIRUS-L posting). If I'm right, you'd better
choose another name for the new beast, otherwise please tell us which
name the Indonesioan virus has acquired, meanwhile.

Ok, update time.

The virus I found wasn't the feist virus.  I viewed the file using a
simple file viewer and found the string "No Frills 2.0" towards the
end.

F-prot 2.05 does NOT have this virus in its database however the
heuristic scan does say that is almost certainly a virus.

Clean 95 incorrectly identifies it as Feist.

No Frills is not in Scan 95 virlist.txt either.

Question: What does No Frills do and can it be removed.

E-mail me if you want a copy of the file.

This morning I received a "beta evaluation copy" of Gobbler-II version
2.99B in the mail from Comrac - a Dutch software producer.  From the
way the accompanying letter was addressed, Comrac clearly got my name

forms and things like electoral rolls I put my occupation as "Computer

Can anyone give me some more background on Comrac?  Have other regular

Subject: Auto-detecting virus (PC)

I would like to write a program that will check if it is per se
holder of a virus.  The method I have in view :

Compile the program.
Compute the checksum of the program.
Put the checksum in the program.
When starting the program : Stop the program if the checksum has been altered.

Advantages :
1- User can not modify the program to remove the copyright notice
   (whic I can code anyway)
2- Virus modifying hte program would be catched immediately so that
   my programs will be reputed for being virus-safe

Inconvenients :
1- This won't work on older DOS versions (since the file name is not available)
2- This will slow down the program loading, but by a small amount

I would like to get feedback (I will keep subscription for that group
for one month as I usually subscribe only to a group when I have a
specific interest).

Also, I never saw a self-protected program.  Even an anti-virus program
has as instructions : use the included diskette if infection is known.
I think this is because DOS can be infected, but I feel these programs
are not self-immunated (but I can be wrong).

Would it be safer to use a 32 bit checksum (I understand a 16 bit
checksum would mean if something if wrong, odd are 1 to 65536 not to
find it).  A 32 bit machine will just count faster a 32 bit sum.
So I would use 32 bit for speed reason instead of security (while
changing the checksum will be harder if 32 bit, and still more if
instead of adding 32 bits, I mask some bits and add them twice).

The solution you require is:
1.  Assuming you have a write protected boot diskette, use this to start your
    system.  If you don't then with this virus you should be safe in booting
    from the hard drive.
2.  Run FDISK /MBR which will replace the partition boot record, (alias
    partition sector or MBR - Master Boot Record), with the standard program
    & retain the correct partition info.

Getting a copy of the partition sector is usually done with a disk
editor, such as that in the Norton Utilities or Central Point PC
Tools.  For Norton 4.5 Advanced Edition you should start the program
in 'maintenance mode' with "NU /M".  Look at Absolute sector 0 on your
hard drive, and you can save this (in FILE mode).

pragma sermon (on)

** Everyone should have a boot diskette **

Not so long ago everybody had a [PC/MS/DR]-DOS diskette with their
system, which could be used to boot it.  However many cheap PCs now
seem to ship with only a partial version on the hard drive, and the
standard MS-DOS 5 upgrade will not boot.  Also systems change over the
years an your boot diskette may not be appropriate anymore.

So you should think about preparing a suitable boot diskette, "just in
case".  Use "FORMAT A: /S", or if the disk is already formatted "SYS
A:", to make a basic boot disk.

If you use a command shell, such as 4DOS, you will need to ensure that
the relevant files are copied to the diskette, and a minimum
"CONFIG.SYS" is prepared to start it correctly.

Copy some basic utilities onto the diskette, such as "DEBUG" (SID in
DR-DOS), "CHKDSK", "FDISK", ...  This is your 'bare bones' boot disk,
test it by booting from it, write-protect it, make an extra copy (with
DISKCOPY) and keep them safe.

If use special software, such as DISK MANAGER or STACKER, to access
your hard drive(s) then you need a second version of the diskette.
This needs to include the software & appropriate "CONFIG.SYS" and/or
"AUTOEXEC.BAT" to start these programs.  Again test the disk,
write-protect, copy & store safely.

DO NOT put WINDOWS, DESQVIEW, QEMM, 386MAX, ...  onto these diskettes
as they are likely to obstruct investigation of your system for faults
or viruses.

Your favourite anti-virus s/w, system checking software (such as
Quarterdeck MANIFEST), should be kept on seperate write protected
diskettes, (so that you don't have to remove the protect on your boot
disks).  Use these after booting from your diskettes, as the copies on
the hard drive may be corrupt or infected.

Well, the good news is that this is almost certainly not a virus.

The bad news is that the s/w is dire, but you'd guessed that already.

The probable explanation is: the software is trying to use a security
mechanism, presumably to prevent duplication (?).  However it was
written with the 32Mb partition limit of DOS versions up to 3.3 in
mind.  So it is mucking around at a low level with your hard drive,
and all references to disk areas are calculated modulo 32Mb.  Meaning
that the first protion of your disk is getting mangled in a
particularly unpleasant manner.  Time to reach for those backups, ...

seconds field in a files time value to 62. I seem to recall that there
is a virus which does this.

If there is then how do I remove it? what does it do etc.

Anyone help?

Thanks,
Andy

I know I'm the not the only person with an old Atari.  I just had a
bunch of bugs appear on my screen and eat up the screen and trash my
disk.  Help please.  I was just going to help a friend with an Amiga
virus and this happens!  BTW, can PC viruses infect my Atari?  I was
using a DOS disk when this happened.

While this seems somewhat plausible I wonder if Intel's chip designers
didn't make the 80x86 processors smart enough to detect memory changes
in the vicinity of the current instruction and reload the pre-fetch
queue in response.

Well, if not then this is a hazard for programs that modify themselves
during runtime.

Subject: On daily scanning (general)

In the ongoing debate concerning scanning versus other types of antiviral
protection, a thought.

Scanning has been denigrated not only for its inability to deal with "new"
viral programs, but also due to time consumption.  David Stang, in his
seminars, stresses that a five minute scan every day adds up to a full
20 hours, half a working week, over the course of a year.

However, in doing some work on a fairly average machine this week (386/25,
80 meg HD with 75 meg of files, 350 executable out of 2400 files), I noted
that Thunderbyte Scan took only 22 seconds to scan the entire thing.  (I
didn't time any of the others, but none of them took five minutes.)

Not necessarily as *reason* to scan on a daily basis, but less reason *not*
to.

A report in InformationWeek in the Aug. 24 edition states that someone
called a Toronto TV station and said that he had put a virus into the
Toronto Stock Exchange which would shut it down at 9:30 the next
morning.

(If true, it would have been much more likely to be a trojan rather
than a virus.)

A tech support team spent all night checking the system for "all known
viruses".

(The TSO uses PCs?)

Trading continued the next day without incident.

(I'm rather surprised that I never saw any media reports about this.)

Comment: although we all know that the existence of computer viral
programs is a real and growing problem, it is getting to the point
where false alarms are creating almost as much "damager" as the
"malware" itself.  There is still *so* much mythical information out
there, and so little hard data in the hands of the public or the
average user.
