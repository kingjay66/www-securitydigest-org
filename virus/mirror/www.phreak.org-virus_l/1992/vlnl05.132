As some of you have noticed, we've been having some e-mail problems
associated with the recent move to the new LISTSERV@Lehigh.edu.
Please be patient and bear with these teething problems for a while
longer while more fine tuning takes place behind the scenes.  We hope
to have the problems resolved shortly.

	Oh for crying out loud...  Just what we need...  A
Virus-Construction Kit for beginners...  I hope that McAfee gets their
hands on this package ASAP, if not sooner.  Here's an idea...  Could
someone conceivably write a virus that will seek out and destroy such
a V.C.L. based on unique strings within the program?  Just an idea...
Please post when McAfee decodes these virii.  I have a feeling that
these virii will be at least as widespread as Jerusalem and Stoned in
a matter of time.

Padgett doesn't mention cleaning utilities, by which I take you to mean
a 'disinfector'.  For a site with multiple PCs cleaning up is a much larger
operation, for example:
*   restoring function and data to the affected PC;
*   react to information about the effects & damage done by the -identified-
    virus, (eg does corrupt database files, ...);
*   determining and clearing up the spread to other PCs, all removable media,
    any PCs used for home-working;
*   documenting the incident for managers and insurance claims;
*   deciding on a level of police involvement, (eg reporting or requesting an
    investigation);
*   determining how the virus entered the site/company, tracing back/forewards
    to customers and suppliers who may be affected;
*   improve the enforcement of existing preventative measures or implement
    new ones.

Of course McAfee's views couldn't possibly be influenced by the fact that his
CLEAN program is shit, could it?  Skulason's FPROT and Solomon's A-V Toolkit
have reasonable disinfection, if required, and take care to disinfect viruses
that they know.

Sure good generic detection (ie checking after booting from a clean floppy)
is great and will spot all viruses.  However this detection will only happen
- -after- the virus has changed your system, in some cases this could be too
late.  A number of known viruses with destructive effects simply use a random
number generator to selet their action, how lucky do you feel?  The sensible
response is to use scanning software as a first line of defence to pick up
known viruses, and an integrity checker as the second line.

felscher@maplog.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de reports a lingering
Cascade/1701 infection.  The description of the problem indicates that
McAfee's VIRUSCAN software may have failed to disinfect files.

I suggest you try Skulason's FPROT (from SIMTEL20 or images) which may
give you a greater degree of assurance.  It also examines some common
compressed executables for viruses present before the compression
(LZEXE, PKLITE, etc).

I haven't used VET, but I have talked to Roger Riordan (the author) at
a couple of conferences and he certainly knows his stuff, both on
viruses loose on Australia and effective techniques for anti-virus
software.  Better still for you he is also in Victoria and will
provide good quality and timely support, two things which you may have
problems with for Viruscan (esp being so far from LA).

Oh, while I am being rude about McAfee, any suggestions as to what
will happen to Viruscan if the "big one" hits LA?

Well, if you define "scanner" as using only simple signature search,
this is correct - such a scanner will only detect viruses it knows or
variants of it.  However, some "scanners" now include the ability to
find non-specific virus-like code, and this approach does enable the
scanner to find around 90-95% of NEW viruses.

Subject: F-PROT, Telecom, false positive ?? (PC)

Situation - After receiving ftp'd *.zip files, I downloaded them
from my mainframe VM session to my PC using Attachmate's Extra for
Windows 3.22, under Windows 3.1. Then I ended my mainframe session and
exited Windows. After unzipping the files onto a floppy, I scanned them
using SCANv93, then Central Point Antivirus 1.2, and then F-PROT 204a.
Central Point's VSAFE is loaded into memory as a tsr, the others are
not. F-PROT gave a message indicating that the Telecom virus
search pattern was found in memory, reboot from a clean floppy. After
rebooting, I scanned with each of the 3 packages, and none reported a
problem. This happened on several different occasions, involving
different unzipped files each time. Is this a case of SCAN or
CPAV leaving a virus string in memory that F-PROT is picking up,
or do I have a problem?
The PC is an Iverson 486/33, DOS 5.0, and QEMM386 6.0. SmartDrive,
VSAFE, and Norton Utilities 6.01's Erase Protect are loaded upon
booting.
Assuming this is just a false positive, is there any reason I shouldn't
scan using any or all of these packages under Windows, with the
mainframe session still active?
Is F-PROT the only one of the 3 that can scan *.zip files, not yet
unzipped?
Thanks for your help.

Hi. I am a computer operator at Penn State Erie, and I have a
student's disk that I ran through F-Prot 2.04.  It detected a virus
named BUGSRES-2 JOKE PROGRAM.  Looking through the Virus information
section of F-Prot, I could not find a description of this virus.
F-Prot also did not disinfect it.  I was wondering if anyone had an
idea of this virus, as in what it does, how to disinfect, etc.
    Any e-mail responses to opa@psuvm.psu.edu will be greatly appreciated.

Subject: How do I reverse the effect(s) of Stoned ? (PC)

Hello,

In brief : I got Stoned and now my hard disk has name D:. How can I correct
           this ?

In detail :

I have an Amstrad PC-1512 with :
        - single DSDD 5''1/4 drive
        - 32Mb hard drive (in fact a FileCard)
        - keyboard, screen, and so on.

I have bought a modem to some unknown fellow; he gave me a floppy with
Kermit on it. Well, not just Kermit. Stoned/Marijuana too. Since I'm
new to the PC world (yes : another Unix/Mac baby -- in fact I grew up
with MULTICS !), I didn't run no scanner on the infected disk. I woke
up the day after with my hard disk named D:. Stop me here if there is
no relation.

From what (I understand among what) I have been told by my scanner,
Stoned sleeps in the boot sector of floppies and attacks hardies, but
doesn't settle down on them. Of course I've erased it from the floppy
but the evil had been done.  Not knowning what to do I "temporarily"
notified to all my software that the hard disk was named D:.

But now I'm tired of it : some days the hard disk is D:, some days
it's C:.  Now what is the best behaviour to get things normal ? Should
I reformat my hard disk ? Would it be of any good ? If I did, could I
trust the files I'd have backed up before reformatting ?

Any help, comment, suggestion or else will be greatly appreciated.

Bruno.

Yes, but it is still important to know the exact name of a virus
sometimes, e.g. to know what damage to expect, or if there is a new
virus around. Probably the main reason for me is if it is the same
virus that was cleaned up last week then I know I have to hunt harder
for some infected diskettes or machine in the department. Knowing the
exact name of a file infector might be becoming less useful (or even
possible?), I must admit, but I would really like to know why SCAN
seems to be going to such great lengths to not identify (or
mis-identify) viruses the way it does. It must be deliberate, surely.

I agree very much with using backups rather than disinfecting,
although with boot sectors the disinfecting process *could* be safe -
unfortunately fewo tell (sometimes) which version of boot sector is required an
d copy
the appropriate one in.

I agree that this sounds like malicious code at work, since t7's
assumption is correct that write-protecting a hard drive is not a part
of standard MS-DOS or (I think) 4DOS or Stacker.  This is especially
likely if you down- loaded from a BBS or from an INCOMING directory of
an ftp site.

Your best bet would be to take your inquiry to comp.virus: that forum
reaches some of the foremost experts in antiviral and other
anti-malicious code work.

Subject: keypress appears and disappears. Help! (PC)

Hi
  I have an aunt who has a confuser that has contracted the key press
virus. I decided that since they are always getting viruses to install
vshield93 in the autoexec file. All this file does is prompt, path and
run mouse.com and win.com.  I inserted vsheild before win.com and it
found key in memory. I booted off a floppy and scanned with scanv93.
(all files). nothing was found. I moved the vshield command up before
mouse.com and this time nothing was found. After windows executed I
started vhield and still it didn't find anything. It's as though
keypress pops up at a specific point and then dispears again almost
straight away.
  Can anyone tell me if this is expected behaviour for keypress and how I
can find it on the hard disk?

Thanks so much.

Subject: Two new Indian viruses found! (PC)

                        NEW VIRUS

Two new Indian Viruses have been found. These were uploaded to
Dr.Alan Solomon by me and his Toolkit now looks out for them.

NAME: MUGSHOT VIRUS (AKA ANIL RAO VIRUS)
- ----------------------------------------
DISCOVERED BY:
Neville Bulsara & Suchit Nanda (Microcomputer Users' Club, Bombay
& Comsoft Services)

This one's a real coool dude! Got his own(?) mugshot inside, and
he flashes it around! Wish it were clearer - would help to make
an example out of him!

INFECTION:
On booting from an infected floppy disk, the virus takes over the
interrupt 9h i.e. the keyboard interrupt and the interrupt 13h
which is the disk interrupt handler.

The keyboard handler does the following:-
The original keyboard vector is revectored to point to interrupt
6Eh which is normally unused. Upon every occurrence of a keyboard
interrupt, the virus increments a series of variables. Once these
variables reach a total value of 512b (200h), indicating that a
total number of 256 keys are depressed, the virus triggers if the
video mode is medium resolution 4 color (320 x 200 - mode 4). At
this point, a flag is set to indicate that the threshold has been
crossed. If the video mode is correct, a mugshot of the "Mug"
himself is displayed on the top left-hand corner of the screen.
This mug shot will remain on the screen as long as you remain in
this graphic mode. If the mode is reset to any other than the one
required by the virus, the mugshot disappears. However switching
back to mode 4 at any point results in the mugshot reappearing as
soon as a key is pressed. In fact, in mode 4 resolution, the
mugshot is refreshed every time a key interrupt occurs.


DISK INTERRUPT HANDLER
The disk interrupt is mapped to 6Dh like Brain & Print Screen.
The virus only infects disks in floppy drives A & B.

On closer examination it seems certain that this is a hacked copy
of the Brain virus. The major change being a completely rewritten
keyboard handler and the mugshot display. The signature is also
different. The stealth algorithm is the same as Brain, as is the
disk handler. Messages have been changed and the name of the
alleged author of the hack is present in between the code.
However, we cannot categorically state that Mr.Anil Rao is the
originator of this virus as changing the name is a relatively
simple job. What we are convinced is that this virus is of Indian
origin as it has not been detected elsewhere and Anil Rao is a
common Indian name.


MUGSHOT POEM (Not part of the virus!)

This is the Mugshot virus
It's a real coool dude
It's got a real mugshot
Whatta pity its not in the nude

Its a namby pamby virus
Which is really a great big pity
If not you would see RedAlert
Reaally selling in this city

What this here guy does
When he's in the mood
Is display his crappy mugshot
Which may be why hell be sued

VA IITD (BAGOBA File Virus)
- ---------------------------
Detected by:
Chetan Varde & Suchit Nanda (Microcomputer Users' Club, Bombay)

Description:
This virus is a memory resident .EXE file infector only. The only
way the virus can get into the memory of the computer is by
execution of an infected .EXE program. Once in the memory the virus
relocates itself at the Top Of Ram at address 9F60:0000h. It then
modifies the Top Of Memory location in the PSP by marking it 00A0h
bytes less than what it actually is. This is done to ensure that DOS
does not allocate the memory used by the virus to any other program.
The virus redirects Interrupt 21h calls to itself so that it can
infect executables when a "load & execute" command is sent to DOS.
The virus has no self recognition scheme built into it and therefore
infected .EXE files continue getting reinfected and hence keep
growing in size. The infection of a file comprises of making the
.EXE  file a perfect multiple of 10h and then appending 663h bytes
of viral code. The header of the .EXE is modified so that the virus
gets control first. The virus also increments the MINALLOC field in
the .EXE file header.

The antivirus VIR_KILL.EXE written by Chetan Varde, a member of
Microcomputer Users' Club, Bombay finds and cleans-up files infected
with this virus. The cleaning-up operation works even if the .EXE
file is infected multiple times by this virus. To ensure that the
virus is not active when this antivirus program is run, it attempts
to restore the address of the MS-DOS kernel in the vector table. As
a result memory resident applications and device drivers may get
disabled. A reboot is recommended after running the antivirus
program to ensure proper working of the machine.

Subject: Virus discovered in file from WUARCHIVE.WUSTL.EDU (PC)

Today I downloaded a file from WUARCHIVE.WUSTL.EDU (one of the
mirroring ftp sites). Filename is
/mirrors/garbo.uwasa.fi/screen/grabsc11.zip When I tried to ran
GRABSCRN.COM from this zip file, Norton Antivirus TSR reported that
the file is infected with Wonder-2 virus.  F-PROT did not report a
virus.  I sent mail to the person who maintains garbo.uwasa.fi and
received an answer that he is out of town till July 27. This means,
the file will not be tested/removed from garbo until then.  Has anyone
downloaded this file before ?  What happened ?

Subject: Re: SAM T4 virus defs file difficulties (Mac)

Attention SAM Users:

If you are experiencing any difficulties after updating your copy of
SAM for the T4 virus and its associated strains, please note that
SAM's ability to provide protection, detection, and repair via Virus
Clinic, Intercept, or Intercept Jr are not compromised or diminished
in any way.

If your system satisfies all three of the following conditions, you
may experience errors when attempting to launch some applications.

    1) using SAM version 3.0.3 or earlier
AND
    2) using the latest SAM Virus Definitions file (7/8/92) or have added
       the T4-A/T4-B virus definition manually via Virus Clinic
AND
    3) running System 7 or MultiFinder under System 6

The specific errors include a -605 system error, -33 system error
(only with System 7 File Sharing enabled), an 'Unknown' system error,
and a system freeze or hang.  Please call technical support at
310-449-4990 from 7:00am - 5:00pm Pacific time, Monday through Friday
if it appears that this situation is affecting your system.

Once again, please keep in mind that protection for all currently
known Macintosh viruses, including the T4 strains, is still very
complete even if you are having these difficulties.

Thank you,

Symantec

	matrix@valinor.mythical.com (JJ Kahrs) asks:
	This may be a totally ignorant question...BUT... Does anybody have a
	list of VMS virilli?

Lucky him.  I have just such a complete list.  It's right here:

For the humor-impaired: There are no known VMS viruses at this time.
It's worth repeating, of course, that neither VMS nor any system is
inherently immune to viruses; but none have been reported as of today
(and I'd be in a position to hear fairly quickly - certainly within a
couple of days of any public discussion).

There HAVE been some network-related VMS "worms" reported.  These go
back a couple of years and, with the tighter security that's the
default in current versions of VMS, they have not been seen recently.

Virilli?
