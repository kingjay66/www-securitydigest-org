When SCAN is run with the /AV option, it will create a validation code
that is used to compare the file against so that it can be checked for
unknown virus.  This process adds ten (10) bytes to the end of .COM
and .EXE files.

SCAN does not add ten bytes to COMMAND.COM or the system files.
Instead, it stores the validation data in a hidden file in the root
directory called SCANVAL.VAL.

This problem has been fixed in version 2.02.  The problem only appears on
certain types of 360K drives - mostly old ones - which do not have a
disk change status line - 1.2M drives and 3.5" drives did not cause the
problem, which is why it never surfaced in testing.

Version 2.02 also corrects a few other problems:

  "Secure Scan" used to report a "possible new variant of Yaunch" when
  scanning certain files, including some OS/2 executables - fixed.

  "Analyse Program" would occasionally crash with a "Divide error"
  message - fixed.

  Version 2.01 had some problems when scanning Bernoulli boxes, and
  when run from the OS/2 DOS box - fixed.

The major changes in 2.02 are not bug fixes of course, but a
considerable speed improvement ans some other nice features.  It is
finished - I am just making some changes to the virus names, to bring
them in line with the recent "standard" naming scheme.

Expect to see an annoucement that 2.02 is available in a couple of days or
so.

Yes Mark you definitely have a 'boot sector' virus, probably a variant
of New Zealand (also known as Stoned or Marijuana).

So what is happening?
Well, the first sector on each DOS diskette is the boot sector, this
carries a short 'boot strap' program and some information about the
disk format.  To infect a diskette the virus copies the original boot
sector to somewhere safe (towards the end of the root directory for
the New Zealand virus), and places a copy of itself in the first
sector.  The purpose of the bootstrap program is to examine the disk
and decide whether it is suitable to boot from, by ensuring the DOS
system files are present, and giving a warning message if they are
missing.

The effect you see is due to a major fault in the New Zealand virus,
and most of subsequent variants, it does not understand that there are
different diskette sizes.  It therefore doesn't include the the disk
size information in the new boot sector.  Without the disk size
information DOS does not correctly recognise some sizes of disk, eg it
assumes 1.2M diskettes are 360k and reads the root directory from the
wrong part of the disk.

The New Zealand virus spreads if you boot your PC from an infected
diskette, even if the diskette does not have the system files.  This
is because the virus is loaded by the BIOS ROM, the virus looks for a
hard disk and infects that, and then it loads the original bootstrap
program.

To confirm this run CHKDSK, for 640k of standard memory it should
normally report "655360 bytes total memory", with New Zealand virus in
memory this will be reduced to 653312.

The solution: either acquire some anti-virus software locally, or send
me your postal address & you can have a program of mine which will
disinfect your hard disk & should be able to recover all your floppy
disks.  To ensure that my program works with the virus version that
you have you can post a copy of an infected diskette to me:
        P.O. Box 1080,
        PEACEHAVEN
        East Sussex  BN10 8BT
        GREAT BRITAIN

Good luck with your clean up,

  ^^^^
Well, "only" is a bit hard... :-) M-DISK is certainly not the only
anti-virus program in the world, which can help you get rid of this
virus. In fact, if you have a DOS 5.0 system disk, you don't need any
anti-virus program at all in order to remove the virus from the hard
disk. Just run FDISK with the /MBR option. It will rewrite the master
boot sector program without touching your partition table information.
The bad news is that the virus might have already destroyed some
information on some kinds of hard disks, but that same happens with
Stoned...

You can remove the virus from diskettes (if their root directory
information has not been destroyed) by copying all the files to
another diskette and reformatting the infected one.

In order to remove the infection from the files (this is a
multi-partite virus), you need some kind of virus scanner, which will
tell you which files are infected, so you can delete them and replace
them from clean backups.

Of course, all this must be done while the virus is not active in
memory (i.e., after booting from a write-protected non-infected system
diskette), since the virus is a stealth one.

If you really want to disinfect the infected files (instead of
removing them), which I strongly discourage you, you might consider
getting a good disinfector. Dr. Solomon's Anti-Virus ToolKit is one,
but even McAfee's CLEAN 85 is able to disinfect this virus from the
files (and it is less expensive than the AVTK). Fridrik Skulason's
F-Prot 2.01 is also a good choice (read: it detects the virus
perfectly, but I haven't found time yet to test its disinfection
capabilities on this virus. You can contact Fridrik Skulason at
frisk@complex.is for more information.) and it is -very- cheap.

The wording of the above sentence is not very exact, which often leads
to misunderstandings. (Tim, I know that you know what you're talking
about, you just didn't express it in the most exact way.)

The wording should be: "For Stoned to infect a hard disk, there must
be an ATTEMPT to boot from and infected diskette." Note that this does
not imply that the attempt is successful. According to my own
experience, most users get re-infected by Stoned not by actually
booting from and infected bootable diskette, but by forgetting an
infected data diskette (i.e., with no DOS or even any executable files
on it) in the A: drive when they are truning their computer on.

The trick is that when you see the "Press any key" message, the hard
disk is -already- infected.

Some time ago we were infected by the Form (boot sector) virus.
Nothing serious happened, but among the computers infected few of them
were running Dos 5.0. We tried to remove the virus using M-DISK but
found that Dos 5.0 is not yet supported.  Is there a new version of
M-DISK available?  Is there any other way to clean up the diskettes
(without formatting :-)) ?

This virus is also known under the following names:

    Kampana (boot)
    Telefonica
    Spanish Telecom (boot)
    Telecom (boot)

It is a very rapidly spreading boot sector virus, which can be quite harmful
as it may reformat the disk on the 400th boot.

This virus is sometimes "dropped" by a different virus - a program virus,
which exists in several versions.  You probably have only the boot virus.

"only" is not correct - I think most other anti-virus programs, at least my
own - can disinfect it as well.

Well, I'm not complaining...I was quite happy with the results, and getting
the top score has only helped me... :-)

Actually, the main reasons why I did not get a perfect score (140 points)
were:

    Speed - Version 2.0 was quite slow compared to some of the other
            scanners - a problem which has been fixed in 2.02.

   Handling of "self-infections" - I did not agree with this part of the
   review, but the question was what what the scanner program should do if
   it determined that it had been infected with a virus.

   Obviously 0 points were awarded if the scanner did not detect the
   infection, but my opinion was that the program should simply abort
   and announce that it had been infected, telling the user to reboot from
   a "clean" disk, and run an original copy of the program.

   They wanted to program to be able to disinfect itself in memory,
   disable the virus, if it was active in memory, and continue as if
   nothing had happened...something which I consider too dangerous.

Nonsense, complete nonsense. If it is in the printer, it cannot force
you to execute it. It cannot copy itself to the computer. It cannot

The whole story is a rumor, just as the "modem virus", an excellent
article about which was posted by Rob Slade just in time.

And the rumor in this case is based on an April 1st joke, made by a
computer magazine.

It is my conviction that part of effective LAN protection from Viruses
and other malicious software must center arount the ability of the
server to be able to authenticate clients prior to permitting access.
This requires the ability for the client to force the client to run
certain applications during the login process. While most
client-server networks provide for such login "scripts", I do not know
of any perr-peer networks that do. I would appreciate hearing from
users who know of any peer-peer networks that can force such action on

Yeah, yeah, but this is mainly wishful thinking - they dream to have

This is not quite exact, and it involves not only SEE.

In fact, the DoD's SBIR (Small Business Innovation Research) program
consists of three phases. During the first one (Concept Feasability),
contracts are awarded for a study of feasability of the projects in
the Army' areas of interest. The awards are for $50,000 over a
six-month period. They say that the available funds will permit
support of approximately 20 % of the proposals received.

Firms that successfully complete Phase I study are eligible to submit
Phase II (Research and Developpment) proposals in that area of study.
The Phase II awards fund research, developpment, and prototype
production. The awards cover a period of two years, and average
$450,000. They expect that the funds will permit to about 40 % of
those who have completed Phase I to progress to Phase II.

Success in Phase II is expected to lead to Phase III (Production and
Commercialization). The SBIR contractors normally obtain funding for
this phase of their product or service from the private sector. The
Government, through its agencies, also provides financial support for
contractors whose products will be used by the U.S. Government. By
law, no SBIR funds are extended for this phase.

Sigh... After all that, there will be again people, who will claim
that I'm a KGB agent... :-) Just FYI, I read all this in an article,
published in the proceedings of a Virus & Security conference. The
document bears, indeed, sceals from the Department of Defense, the
Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, the Department of
the Air Force, DARPA, the Defense Nuclear Agency, and the Strategic
Defense Initiative Organization, but it also has an inscription, which
says that "Nothing on this page is classified or proprietary
information/data"...

Hope that this clears any misunderstandings... :-)
