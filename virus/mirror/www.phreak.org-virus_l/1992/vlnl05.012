diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  (The complete set of posting guidelines is available by
FTP on cert.sei.cmu.edu or upon request.)  Please sign submissions
with your real name.  Send contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU
(that's equivalent to VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).
Information on accessing anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue
archives is distributed periodically on the list.  Administrative mail

Subject: Low-level utilities (PC)

	OK, I find it hard to stay away. Yesterday my son cleaned out
& painted his room and it was raining so I had a chance to put
together a final piece I had been meaning to for some time: FixFBR,
the last part of my low level utilities.

	FixFBR is designed to replace the Boot Record on floppy disks
with non-bootable code that performs part of my integrity checking and
displays a message if a boot from floppy is performed. An additional
warning will be displayed if a typical Boot Sector Infector is present
(the .DOC has more of an explination).

	The technique is fairly simple so I do not anticipate problems
(right) and it has been tested but at this point it must be considered
an ALPHA. Since I do not have a 2.88 floppy drive, at the moment it is
limited to the big four floppies: 360k, 720k, 1.2Mb, & 1.44 Mb (did
not see any need for including 160k or 320k 5 1/4s but would not be
difficult).

	Since the entire BR including the BPB is replaced, any viruses
lurking there are defanged (incidently FixFBR also performs a number
of integrity checks on the original BR that will announce the presence
of most BR viruses - not the name but that "something" is wrong. The
BR is then - with permission - overwritten).

	Also, with this release, the Shareware price of the "Fix"
utilities is changed to $1.00 per supported PC/user (other options
available - see the .Doc). This includes both FixMBR and FixFBR. The
code used in SafeFBR and SafeMBR as well as NoFBoot and the CHK
detection utilities remain copyrighted Freeware (may be used freely so
long as not changed).

	Barring major setbacks, this should be available for Anonymous
FTP from Claude Hayes at URVAX (141.166.1.6) as FIXUTIL.ZIP in the
antivirus directory - Right, Claude ?

	Does anyone know anything about a virus that McAfee SCAN
reports as SBC?  Neither SCAN 8.4 nor F-PROT seem to know about it
(though f-prot 2.01's analyze will detect it in memory).

Subject: Michelangelo questions (PC)

I had a Zenith 386 SX machine infected.  When booting up with the
infected diskette, I get a "Disk read error" message.  When I reboot
off the hard disk, I get a "Unable to read boot code from partition"
message, and the computer is disabled unless I boot off the floppy.
If I run a CHKDSK, I still get 655360 bytes total memory.  F-Prot 2.01
recognizes the existence of the virus, but does not remove it.  The
installation of VIRSTOP does not seem to affect the installation of
the virus or the subsequent screen messages.  McAfee's CLEAN does
remove it.

Since the virus denies access to the hard disk as soon as it is
installed, what is the meaning of the March 6th date?  Isn't the virus
supposed to be dormant until that date?  Why does my experience not
match Padgett's description of its activities?

Do not know about VIRSTOP but can make the following observations
about VSHIELD: Have been loading high for some time using its /LH
switch. This also works under QEMM 5.0+ but only with MS-DOS 5.0 -
does not work with earlier MS-DOS versions nor with DR-DOS 6.0
(reports itself as IBM 3.3).  When the internal /LH switch is used a
416 byte "connection" is left in low menory. This can also be loaded
high with either the DOS LOADHIGH or the QEMM LOADHI commands but then
CHKSHLD cannot find it (if you care).

Can also say it finds things when loaded this way, at least on my PCs.

Believe the problem stems from the large extent of memory required for
initial memory & vital area check it makes that is reduced following
load.  Have also found that it needs a certain amount of contiguous
memory (forget how much) to load and consequently load it FIRST in
Autoexec.Bat (I believe the .DOC recommends loading it LAST but had
case of refusing to load then - at present I have about 121k loaded
high).

Subject: PC Computing Magazine Virus Articles, Feb 92 (PC)

    PC Computing Magazine, February 1992, has two articles on computer
viruses.  The first, entitled "Virus-Proof Your PC", examines the
characteristics of 11 products.  With no false modesty I must comment
that Rob Slade's reviews and my own on anti-viral programs are of
higher quality.  Different persons reviewed the 11 products, and
propose some evaluation statements without much supporting
information.  There is no overview of the test methodology, no
specific identification of those malicious programs against which the
programs performed, and no consistent identification of the version of
the program actually tested.  The article relies heavily on
information from the National Computer Security Association and on
Patricia Hoffman's Hypertext Virus Summary List.  There is no mention
of the Virus-L Forum which is unforgivable.

    The second article is a summary of 350 FAX responses to a
questionnaire on computer viruses which appeared in an earlier
edition.  The survey size is so small that the results on infection
rates and on defensive strategies seem statistically insignificant.

p1@arkham.wimsey.bc.ca (Rob Slade) writes:

			 More hardware myths
   3) "BIOS" virus
   First of all, BIOS is ROM BIOS.  The RO in ROM stands for "read
   only".  The BIOS, therefore, cannot be infected by a virus.  At
   least, not yet.  Intel has already developed flash EEPROMs which
   it is pushing as "upgradeable" ROMs for the BIOS.  It *is*
   possible to get "bad" ROMs, and it is even possible that a run
   of BIOS ROMs would be programmed such that they constantly
   "release" a virus.  It hasn't yet happened, though, and it is
   extremely unlikely, as well as being easy to trace.

"Upgradeable" means the *user* can update (*change*) his BIOS from a
program distributed on a floppy or other media.  The danger of flash
EAPROMs is a real area of concern and should not be taken lightly.

True, they have not hit the marketplace yet but figure:

* first line virus defense is booting off a floppy from power-on so that
  you have a "known" stable and virus free environment.

* a flash virus invades the system and reprograms the system BIOS

* your BIOS that is a known state can be altered then it is now an
  "unknown" and no longer trustworthy.

This is the danger to be considered but fortunately it has been.  The
following things can/are being done:

* hardware enable of reprogramming (switch/jumper plug, etc)
* "protected" portions of the chip that cannot be changed.
* elaborate "locks" to reprogram (indeed, the memory cells are
  relatively fragile and can be damaged by improper programming
  algorithms).
* CRCs, LRCs and or checksums to increase reliability and integrity.

Most importantly is that different vendors are implementing their own
hardware and the lack of a "standard" should prevent any flash virus
from having a large enough culture to thrive in.

Subject: New virus found (PC)

I recently found a new virus, here in Mexico City. After debugging the
code, I found a message ("Moctezumas Revenge"), The virus uses an
aproach to code infection similar to the Jerusalem virus. No virus
scanner catchs it so I wrote a signature for the virus (this signature
works fine with ThunderByte Scan):

             062e 8f060201 1e2e 8f0600010e07

as soon as I know more about the internals of the virus (such as the
date of activation: Yes, it has an activation date, but it seems that
it only clears a portion of the screen), I'll post-it here.

Subject: WWIV4.20 doesn't like Vshield (PC)

I recently got WWIV4.20 and started to set up a BBS here in
Carbondale.  I was running Vshield at the time, and noted that WWIV
would boot OK, and every thing would run normally untill I decided to
exit WWIV (I'm still doing setup).  When I would exit WWIV, the system
would HARD HANG and I would have to hit the reset button.  I have
since stopped using Vshield and have taken to scanning the HD regulary
for viruses using SCAN85, which seems to work just fine.  I haven't
got enough RAM to run DV, that's next...does anyone know if there are
any incompatibilities between McAfee's antivirus utilities and
Desqview?

To those who are interested in information regarding the Michelangelo Virus

My machine was infected with Michelangelo for about two weeks, and worked
normally for that time.  The only clue I had was that Microsoft SmartDrive
would not load and cited an 'Incompatible Disk Partition'

After banging my head against the wall trying to figure out why, I ran F-prot
2.01 and it discovered the Michelangelo Virus.  I removed it successfully with
F-prot 2.01 and the problems with SmartDrive were eliminated..

I hope this possible sign helps...

Subject: An A/B floppy drive switch design (PC)

	Last August, I posted a two part paper that described attempts
	to contain virus infections at San Jose State University. It
	referred to a device for helping prevent infections.
	This posting describes that device, which makes a single
	floppy drive appear as either A or B, depending on the switch
	position. This purpose of this functionality is to allow or prevent
	booting a single floppy drive PC from a floppy disk. While the
	switch is in the non-boot mode, floppy disks infected with boot
	sector infectors, such as Azusa or Stoned, are prevented from
	infecting the hard disk. The device has been tested on an IBM
	XT class machine, clones using the Phoenix and AMI BIOS, and an
	AST Premium machine.

	A simple design using a 74LS157 Quad 2-IN Multiplexer can switch
	the drive select and motor enable signals to the floppy drive to
	make it appear electrically as drive A or drive B. The CMOS setup
	also needs to be changed to show drive A or B installed, according
	to the switch position. Ideally, the switch would be the keylock
	type that is built into most AT-class machines. The device can be
	inserted into the FDC cable, by means of a 8 pin edge card connector,
	or a 8 pin DIP plug connector. Note that only 4 lines are shown
	coming in. The ribbon cable actually has 7 lines that are cut and
	twisted 180 deg. at the FD A connector. The odd numbered lines are
	at signal ground. The electrical-physical design is shown below. The
	lines marked as FDC come from the controller. The lines marked as
	FD go to the floppy drive A connector. The LS157 pin numbers are
	given next to the multiplexor symbols, with pin 15 connected to
	an odd numbered input line. The chip must also be connected to power
	(+5v) and ground at pins 16 and 8, respectively.

Hi! Everybody!

My name is Xavier Salmon and I am in charge of the computer System in
the ESPOL ( Escuela Superior Politecnica del Litoral ) in Guayaquil-E-

Now our major concern is about security, could somebody out there,
help us with suggestions or references where we can find information
about protection against "Malicious Programs" ( worms, virus, etc.

Any information will be appreciated.
Please write directly to U10009@SNAESP2.BITNET.
Thank you very much.

   As people started to raise objections to the possibility of this

I think the moral of the story is not to blindly believe what you
read, especially if it comes off of fidonet.  I always felt that
fidonet was the lowest form of life on the internet foodchain.

Seriously, one of the "problems" with the internet and related
networks is that to a casual observer the "Mike RoChenle"s have the
same visibility and stature as the Rob Slades and Padgett Petersons.

   it.  BBSes, and, by extension, modems, have had a consistently,
   and unfairly, bad press over the past few years.  BBSes are seen
   as the ultimate source of all "evil" programs; viri and trojans;
   and anything bad said about them is to be believed.

It is still my belief that BBSs are a major vector for the spread of
viruses and nasty code.  I don't mean to paint all BBSs with the same
brush but consider that access is mostly anonymous and a lot of people
using BBSs are barely computer literate.  The ease of access to BBSs
and the questionable nature of security and integrity make them an
easy target to aid the spreading of viruses.

Subject: new pgms from Padgett Peterson (PC)

Hello.  Glad to report the availability of new programs from A.
Padgett Peterson:

FIXMBR22.ZIP	This program is designed to replace the standard MS-DOS master
		boot record program with code that does more than just find the
		active partition and jump to the O/S boot record.
		This archive contains also the latest version of SafeMBR.
		Now shareware.  Update.

CHK     .ZIP	Two utilities to check both floppy and hard disk and detect the
		"Michelangelo" virus.
		These two programs are integrity checkers.

FIXFBR11.ZIP	FixFBR is a generic anti-virus program and repair tool for
		infected and corrupted boot records on floppy disks.  FixFBR
		first checks the disk for a valid Boot Parameter Block (BPB)
		and does a generic test for infection/corruption.  Once the
		disk has been identified (and the user has an option to
		change if incorrect), the complete boot record is replaced with
		non-bootable but error checking and flagging code.  If the disk
		is wished to be made bootable, the DOS SYS command will be
		effective.

FIXUTIL .ZIP	For the user who wishes to get Padgett's FIXxxx programs.
		Contains:  CHK.ZIP, FixMBR22.ZIP and FixFBR.ZIP.

CHKINT  .ZIP	Checks the interrupts of a given program without running the
		said program.  Useful to track possible trojan horses.
		This program used to be in [.msdos.utility].

Reading the respective doc files is a must with Padgett's programs to avoid
problems later.

	   PCs.  This is *hopefully* solved.  For whose who use Zmodem, no
	   change will be apparent.  For whose using Kermit, the command
	   set file type fixed instead of set file type binary *MUST* be issued
	   *before* the server command and download start.
