Subject: Bloody Virus (PC)

         Maybe two months ago I had the greusome esperience of
         down loading some e-mail from the main computer via
         modem to my pc at home. Immeddiatly one of my floppy
         drives stoped working, but I had no idea what was
         happenning. I took my computer to be serviced, the
         person ran some viral scanner and found a virus had
         infected the hard disk. He unfortunatly failed to have
         an antivirus for the virus that was infecting my
         machine. I eventually, many dauys later found out
         mcafee. It ran it and cleaned the machine of the
         infection. The virus was "Bloody Virus".  Now I'm afraid
         of down loading files into my pc from the main computer.
         What can I do to prevent an infection of the sort My
         computer suffered? any software (public domain)
         available for this sort of stuff. Unfortunatly I didn't
         know then of this group.

Huh, pardon my ignorance... I know what QEMM is (although I'm not
using it) and have heard that it has a stealth mode, but have no idea
what this mode consists in... Does it mean that it permits loading of
a resident program in a "shadowed" and read-only area of memory? If it
is possible to mark the memory occupied by the program as read-only,
this means that the virus will not be able to patch it (unless there's
a way to make it writable again), but this -is- memory protection and
my initial message dicussed the situation with no memory protection.

I'm afraid you are forgetting about Windows and its silly swapfile -
why else do you think it must not be on a Stacked volume... Also, I
have the suspiciouns that Norton Disk Doctor will have problems to run

Subject: Problem booting from c: Drive (PC)

This message has been posted to both VIRUS-L and WIN3-L. I apologize    y
persons subscribed to both lists receiving duplicate messages.

I have a computer containing a AMI 386/33 mother board, 4MB RAM, 120MB
Connor's IDE Hard Drive (partitioned 80/40), 1.44 & 720 disk drives,
SVGA monitor, mouse, running MSDOS 4.01, Windows 3.0 and various
applications.

Problem first appeared when I turned the system on a week ago Sunday.
Every thing booted fine, preliminary Windows screen came up, then a
Windows dialog box appeared stating "can not read C: drive".

I did a cold reboot and the normal memory check and AMI board config's
appeared. Next, the system tries to read the C: to run the system
programs (IO.SYS, MSDOS.SYS) but locks up instead.

Troubleshooting Done:

System will boot fine from a backup boot disk. Can read c: drive.
Latest version of Central Point Anti-Virus has been on the machine
since before the "Mike" epidemic in "scan at boot-mode". Ran full
scan with CPAV and detected no viruses. Commented out all config.sys
and autoexec.bat commands and tried reboot. Same thing. Recopied
system files to c: drive using SYS.COM. Surprise, worked.
Rebooted again to be sure. No such luck. Future attempts to delete,
recopy system files successfully transfer system, files are present,
reboots are unsuccessful.

Other Oddities:

Windows WIN.INI and SYS.INI disappeared. Tried to locate any evidence
of them using PCTOOLS 7.1 (latest version) and the UNDELETE directory
read identifies 4500 directories before locking up. All other PCTOOLS
options read the directories with no problems.

Deleted all Windows files/directories. Windows SETUP creates new
WINDOWS directory, stops installation and drops to the A>.

Next Step??

I am going   to try a different virus scanner. Someone told me to
check the battery (?). Any other suggestions??

Please reply directly to me as I am not a regular subscriber to the
lists.

Thanks in advance for any help.

Subject: Re: Polymorphic List (PC)

The list of polymorphic viruses was somewhat incomplete.  I can think
of at least 2 which weren't mentioned; there were probably a lot more.
those two are the Bob Ross (aka Beta) virus and Screaming Fist virus,
both written by the group PHALCON/SKISM.  I recently recieved 3 new
viruses, which I haven't tested.  They're supposedly from Bulgaria,
and only one used DAME.  That's the only one which can be scanned.  As
I said, they may or may not work, but considering the source from
which they came, I assume they are new.  As far as I know, they
haven't been distributed except on two or three US virus boards.
Anyone who has seen the file (SOMEVIRS.ZIP) and knows what it
contains, please inform the rest of us...  if I get a chance to test
the programs, I'll post.

Sure, if you succeed to explain me what do you understand under Ping
Pong B. In her VSUM document Patricia Hoffman states that this version
of Ping Pong is able to infect hard disks. She is incorrect; there has
never been a floppy-only version of Ping Pong. We have a slightly
hacked version of the virus here that we're calling Ping_Pong.B - it
is the version modified by the Yankee Doodle virus to inactivate
itself after 256 reboots.

Not true.  Any program can make a direct call to INT 13.  However, there is
no guarantee that INT 13 points to DOS/BIOS since any program or virus
can change the interrupt vector.

***** Matt adds: *****
I have implemented similar protection on hundreds of PCs at my university.
The protection has prevented virus infection in almost 100% of instances.
Since DOS has no built-in protection, any protection scheme will depend
upon either hardware, an EPROM chip with code that is executed during the
POST or obscurity.  The software I developed (maybe Alex's too) depends
upon obscurity: one must be very familiar with the internals of DOS.
However, I am not concerned with this type of threat because the protection
is installed simply to prevent students from changing the lab software.

F-Prot 2.02's Virstop.exe had conflicts with various configurations of

F-Prot 2.03 does not have that problem with the same machines.  I

[IMHO MODE ON]
Firstly, I am pessimistic about virus protection on the PC while there
is still strong pressure from users and software developers for
backward compatibility.  Most of the solutions to the problem, that
would involve new viruses having to carry around a huge toolkit of
low-level routines, would also cause lots of software to be broken.
Notice I'm not concerned about existing viruses, nor viruses written
using existing techniques (even polymorphic "engines")... it is a
question of what a really dedicated virus writer *could* do in the
future. The discussions about the usefulness of any software-only
protection system all hinge on that point. (The only thing stopping
the extermination of present-day viruses is that not enough users make
the slightest effort, until they're stung).
[IMHO MODE OFF]

It is theoretically possible to use the power of the 386 (or better)
to prevent tunnelling viruses (in fact just about any virus that
doesn't get control of the computer before the anti-viral software).
It doesn't have to mean using protected mode (but, from what I've
seen, it is the most convenient, so long as it is built into the
operating system), but it does involve some (okay, LOTS of) speed
degradation.

Instead of TSR's sitting on interrupts such as int 13, it is possible
to check the program as it is loaded.  Okay, nothing new so far.  But
what you can do is interpret (instead of execute) the first few
instructions. Because of the way that viruses infect, it is much
easier for them to execute at the start of the program than the end.
During this stage, it is possible to watch for any illegal disk or
memory accesses.  This could be done on any PC (8088 chip up), but the
speed you get with a 386 is pretty important, as is the memory space
for the emulation software.

At this stage, you're probably saying that a virus could be specially
built to waste lots of time at the start, until the TSR thinks the
code being executed must surely be out of any viral area, and stops
interpreting.  But, to do so the virus would have to slow down the
execution of all programs, which should make them obvious to users. Or
they could do some sort of instructions to test if there is such
software in place, but remember they are being interpreted, so we can
fib about anything... the only sensible test they could do is timing,
and that would require access to one of the internal timers, which is
something the TSR would detect and could trigger a more thorough test
of the program.

The result would be that the first fraction of a second of code would
take a bit longer to execute - perhaps comparable with the time it
would take to load it off disk in the first place, but rest of the
program would run as fast as ever. That should keep the users happy.

Well, anyone see any problems with that? I must admit I can think of a
few minor ones, but I think it looks worthwhile enough to pursue
further.  I'd be happy if anyone wants to take the idea and make some
workable software out of it; and I could provide some help, but I
can't afford the time to do the whole thing at the moment.

Looks like history repeating itself.  I wonder if the virus writers
will be slower to copy ideas from the Macintosh world than Microsoft
was :-) Seriously, though, it looks like something anti-virus people
need to look at pretty darned quickly, although I doubt that a virus
that requires MS Windows to be present would get very far at the
moment. (but then again...?)

Most can be told to search more, but the default is .COM and .EXE.
Personally, I think the default should be .COM and .EXE and .SYS and
any file that starts with MZ.  The .BAT, .PIF and .BAS viruses are
rare enough to not include them by default. Any other extensions don't
need to be scanned for general viruses but for specific viruses, to
save time.

Subject: Disinfectant 2.8 (Mac)

Disinfectant 2.8

April 19, 1992

Disinfectant 2.8 is a new release of our free Macintosh anti-viral
utility.

Version 2.8 detects the new CODE 252 virus.

The CODE 252 virus was discovered in California in April, 1992.

The virus is designed to trigger if an infected application is run or
an infected system is started up between June 6 and December 31 of
any year, inclusive. When triggered, the virus displays the following
message:

   You have a virus.
   Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha
   Now erasing all disks...
   Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha
   P.S. Have a nice day
   Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha
   (Click to continue...)

Despite this message, no files or directories are deleted by the virus.
However, a worried user might turn off or restart a Macintosh upon seeing
this message,  and this could corrupt the disk and lead to significant
damage.

Between January 1 and June 5 of any year, inclusive, the virus simply
spreads from applications to System files, and then on to other
application files.

Due to errors in the virus, it only spreads to new applications under
System 6 without MultiFinder. The Finder also usually becomes infected.

Under System 6 with MultiFinder, the virus infects the System file and
the "MultiFinder" file, but it does not spread to new applications.

Under System 7, the virus infects the System file, but it does not spread
to new applications. A bad error in the virus can cause crashes or damaged
files under System 7.

Under any system, the virus infects the System file, and it can and will
trigger the display of the message.

The virus contains a number of additional errors which could cause
crashes, damage, or other problems on any system.

In addition to recognizing the new virus, there are a few other changes
in version 2.8 of Disinfectant.

Version 2.8 corrects an error in version 2.7.1 which caused crashes during
or after scans on the Mac Plus and 512KE running System 6 with MultiFinder.

The protection INIT no longer checks the System file for viruses at
startup time. This makes the INIT smaller, more efficient, and more
robust.

Version 2.8 also includes some changes to the protection INIT which we
hope will make it more compatible with other software.

The "Protection" section of the online manual now discusses the problem
of what to do when you want to use the Disinfectant INIT together with
some other INIT which is supposed to load first.

Disinfectant 2.8 is available now via anonymous FTP from site
ftp.acns.nwu.edu [129.105.113.52].  It will also be available soon on
sumex-aim.stanford.edu, rascal.ics.utexas.edu, comp.binaries.mac,
America Online, CompuServe, GEnie, Delphi, BIX, MacNet, Calvacom,
AppleLink, and other popular sources of free and shareware software.

Macintosh users who do not have access to electronic sources of free and

the new 'CODE 252' virus.  The problem has been found, and will be corrected
in version 3.8 and later.

WHAT CAN YOU DO?
    In the cases where Virex reported the 'false positives', there have been
multiple UDVs entered.  If Virex reports that a file is infected with
the CODE 252 virus, double-check by removing ALL other UDV's and scanning
again.  We have not seen any false positives using this method (but they may
still be possible).

PLEASE NOTE:
    This problem affects the UDV feature ONLY!  The normal detection and
repair capabilities of Virex were not affected.

Again, we are sorry for any inconvienence/trauma this has cased,
Eric Conger

                             Regularly:

As with "what is an office" so here, "what is regularly?"  This is
going to depend on your situation, but, in general, it is going to
mean "more often than you do now."  The items under this section of
the list are particularly those that should be going on regularly for
good maintenance and support anyway.

_ Back up data

Our good old friend, the backup.  Why stress the data?  Three
reasons.  First, programs and structure should be backup up at
installation and at every change in configuration.  They need not be
backed up between times.  Second, backing up data only reduces backup
time and increases the frequency with which people are wiling to do a
backup.  Third, you can buy another copy of Perfect Writer tomorrow.
Can you buy another copy of your last months receivables?

_ Monitor disk space, map, memory map

Especially if you partition programs from data, checking the free
space can give you a quick indication of many problems.  On a disk
map, check for increasing numbers of bad sectors showing up, or
programs which insist on moving to the end of the disk.  Again, the
memory map should primarily be checked at boot time.  You need not
understand what all the numbers and interrupts mean, but if they
change you might have a serious problem.

_ Monitor program file sizes

If programs are partitioned from data (and data should here include
any configuration files which change frequently), disk space should
give a quick check for prepending or appending file infecting viri.
A listing of the files themselves would indicate specific infections.
Generally speaking, a check of the sizes of program files takes less
time than might be realized at first.  Modern commercial programs
take up a lot of space, but the number of individual files is not
excessive.  (Except for those of us who have to have all the very
latest in freeware utils ...  :-)

   Hello netters,
it's spring time and we need to cheer up a little. Following is a silly
poem for all to enjoy. Please do not take it seriously. It is nothing but
a product of Tarkan's idle moments.

          Boys in the Hood

Fudgett, Chess, Wells all in all
Always on the net, playing ball
Pogue, MtE, others on the roll
It's time for a duty call

S.O.S. S.O.S.
Poor users cry for a recess
Do good deeds, don't just confess
Go right ahead and try VDS

Frisk, Doc John and the rest
Get ready for a little test
Name the virus that has a nest
In every PC with a hairy chest

P.S.: Now does anyone care to read my "scanner song"? It is a lot better.
