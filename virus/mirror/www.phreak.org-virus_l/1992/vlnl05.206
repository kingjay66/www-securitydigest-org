Subject: Administrative: The vote count, changes for 1993

On 10 December, I asked the group to vote on whether or not vendor
support questions should be allowed on VIRUS-L/comp.virus.  The
official vote is:

barnabas% scan +vl/vote/support-yes | wc -l
     122
barnabas% scan +vl/vote/support-no | wc -l
       8

Which translates to 122 in favor of allowing vendor support questions
to 8 against.

Now, before either "side" gets bent out of shape, I'd like to try to
accomodate everyone as well as I can.  Let me elaborate...  In
addition to the votes that I got, I received numerous suggestions.
Many of the people that were in favor of support questions were in
favor of them as long as they don't get carried away.  Also, most of
the people that said that they were against the questions said that
they didn't want the forum to be exclusively a support forum.
I believe that we can come pretty close to making everyone happy if we
make a compromise or two.  Here's what I suggest:

o Product-specific questions will be accepted.
o Follow-up discussions will be rejected, with the exception of
  problem resolution summaries.  Meaning, people posting product
  questions should carry subsequent related discussions on via e-mail;
  once the problem has been resolved, a summary of the solution can be
  posted to the group.  
o Summary postings will be accepted from the vendor or the original
  author of the question.  (If both are submitted, the author's will
  be accepted over the vendor's.)
o People asking these questions are encouraged to summarize and post
  the replies that they receive.

o Product announcements will be accepted, although I again request
  that contributors make every effort to announce their wares
  objectively and as non-commercially as possible (e.g., please avoid
  pricing charts, blatant commercialism, discounting structures).
  Announcements that I feel go beyond this fine (subjective) line will
  be returned to the contributor, along with an explanation.
  (BTW, I am listing this as a separate item because it is not the
  same as a product _support_ question, IMHO.  Nonetheless, many of
  you mentioned that you still want to see product announcements.)

Not every situation is going to fit neatly into the above scenario, of
course.  Also, I can't guarantee that I will reject every
support-related follow-up, but I will try.  The sorts of follow-up that
I will specifically reject include messages such as, "what version
are you running?", "did you try X?", "that product is garbage, try ABC
instead.", etc.  Please don't expect me to be an e-mail forwarder for
these postings - send them directly to the person that asked the
question.  When I reject a posting, I delete it.

I hope that the above scenario will be acceptable to most everyone.
As always, I'm open to other suggestions.


Now, on to 1993 and Volume 06.  In addition to the vote, I have
received numerous suggestions for changes to the format for 1993.
Most of the suggestions were well thought out and would benefit the
group, so I'd like to implement those which are feasible.  They
include (so far - there will probably be more to come):

o Digest ordering will be non-PC first, and then PC issues, followed
  by general discussions, reviews, etc., (as before).  The rationale
  for this is that PC questions make up by far the highest percentage
  of traffic on this group, so it is easier for the non-PC people and
  only slightly more difficult for the PC people to find the articles
  that they are interested in.  Comp.virus readers should not find
  things any easier or more difficult.
o I am going to _strongly_ recommend that anyone affiliated with an
  anti-virus vendor state so clearly in the text of every message
  submitted.  Obviously, this is impossible to police with 100%
  effectiveness.  However, I do know most of the "players" in this
  community and will politely reject postings from people that I know
  are, or are found to be, affiliated with vendors and do not disclose
  the fact in their postings.  This is not intended to bias the group
  away from vendors; indeed, vendor contributions here are (for the
  most part) greatly appreciated.  Instead, my intent is to help the
  readers be aware of whose postings they are reading.  As with other
  forums, disclaimers are quite acceptable, as long as they accompany
  a statement of affiliation.

That's all for now.  Happy holidays to all (particularly those that
are celebrating holidays 'round about now - otherwise, um, happy
solstice :-).

Cheers,

unreadable I wrote.

We have since established that if you set the sectors per cluster 
field (offset 0dh) in the BIOS Parameter Block to zero in the boot 
sector of an otherwise normal disk all versions of DOS will crash 
immediately you try to access the disk.  All utilities we have 
tested also crash.  You can format the disk with DOS 3 & 4 but 
Format will crash under DOS 5 unless you use the /u option.

F-Prot, Dr. Solomon's Toolkit, & McAfee Scan all crash.  VET crashes 
too, but we are working on it!

Rumor has it that a newer verion of the Phalcon/Skism MPC (Mass
Produced Code Generator) is going to be released sometime soon.  My
source didn't say when, but "soon".  Also, a new edition of the 40-Hex
magazine is suposedly coming out around New Years.  Happy New Year

Further investigation reveals DAME was reported by NAV V9.5, *NOT*
some infected program running on the machine. SCAN V99 did not find
it.  The owner has good habits, controls access to the PC and is
careful about installing new software.  I'm concluding it's a false
positive.  I'd like to thank the folks at MacAfee and HI Industries
who were kind enough to call and offer the benefit of their
experience.

Subject: Another new version of Zerotime. (PC)

We have just received another version of Zerotime (or Slow) virus, 
which would appear to have been patched locally.  Two instructions  
have been swapped, as shown below.  The only existing program we 
have tried which will find it is F-Prot, which identifies it as "a 
new strain of Slow".

This would have been fairly trivial if the finder had not had many 
files in which the virus was protected by a CPAV product, supposed 
to provide integrity checking.  This is reported in another note.

The effects of this virus do not seem to be well known.  It is 
Jerusalem derived, is not obvious, and does not make the PC run 
slow.  However for every 2nd file closed during business hours on 
any Friday it sets the file date & time to zero (ie midnight on Jan 
1st, 1980).  This would appear to be intended to trick accounting 
and backup software into thinking that the the latest weeks results 
are incredibly boring old rubbish, and throwing them away.  

It also mutates, and occasionally generates a version with a new 
randomly derived signature (used by the virus when checking if a 
file is already infected).  The new version recognises, and will not 
re-infect, files infected by its parent.  As no reputable scanner 
uses this signature this has no practical significance.  Zerotime is 
quite common in Australia.

Oddly DIR does not show a date or time for files dated Jan 1, 1980.

Subject: Re: Stoned Virus (PC)

I've encountered what seems to be a new variant of stoned (according
to a guy who works in the computer center here) on my diskettes when I
use them in our computer labs occassionally.  Norton Anti-Virus sees
as it as my boot sector being infected by Bloomington, while f-prot
says I have stoned.  According to f-prot's files in viruses,
Bloomington is a cousin to stoned.

The guy I spoke to is sending my diskette to the author of f-prot.
It's quite annoying; it creates invisible junk files on my diskettes.
I'll get a file name on there with portions of garbage characters and
some partial words like "DOS 5.0" or other words.  Just recently it
destroyed a bunch of files that thankfully I couldn't find again,
though it was a major pain.

I just hope that everybody realizes that the ability of a program to
detect the files generated by the "Virus Simulator" does not at all
indicate if it will detect the actual viruses or vice versa, which
makes this effort quite pointless, IMHO.

Subject: SVC 6.0 not rem. by F-PROT206a (PC)

Hi everybody,

I think I've found a bug in f-prot 206a.
A week ago I had two guys with their pc's in our office who had
cought the SVC virus in version 6.0.
SCAN V99 reported [SVC] and(!) [SVC 5.0] in the boot sector and on
various .com & .exe files, an information I decided not
to trust, because of the multiple report of infection.
F-PROT found (correctly) SVC 6.0 (4644 bytes), but only on the .com & .exe
files.
After removing the virus (which f-prot claims to do correctly)
all infected files were absolutely identical with the originals, that were
present on security-disks, but knowing that SVC 6.0 does infect the boot-
sector i ran scan again; with the result, that it reports [SVC] and [SVC5.0]
still present in the boot sector.
I removed the virus with CLEAN (V97) [SVC50] and everything was fine.

Now the Questions: Is the above a known bug with F-PROT? If yes, will Frisk
                   fix it in the next release, and when will McAfee get rid
                   of their double reports and get the right names, so one
                   can assume to clean the right virus with CLEAN?

By the way: the virus information of F-PROT says that SVC 6.0 is only a
            .exe & .com infector, which is simply not true!

I agree with part of this.  Yes, it depends on the algorithm, and
using a different seed does not necessarily make an algorithm secure.
To give an example, if you alter the seed of a simple checksum
algorithm (in the literal sense of "sum") from 0 to something unique
to each computer, it's just as easy to forge checksums as with a
fixed seed of 0.
  However, I have a couple of minor quibbles with the rest of the
paragraph (let's call it "hair splitting"; I'm tired of "nit pick-
ing").  First, you write as if all algorithms have a seed.  Well, in
the case of the MDx algorithms, I suppose you could say that the
initial contents of the buffers constitute a seed; also that DES has a
seed when used for authentication purposes (ANSI X9.9), namely the
initial block.  But what do you mean by "using a different seed for
the checksum" in the case of CRC?
  More important, in the case of MDx and X9.9, how do you know that
varying the seed is enough?  You *may* be right, but to the best of my
knowledge, neither the buffer contents of MDx nor the initial block of
X9.9 were designed for that purpose.  Notice in the case of X9.9 that
security against forging is obtained, not by varying the seed (initial
block), but by each user using a different (unknown) *key*.  So with
MDx, varying the seed is probably *not* the most secure approach.  One
obvious possibility would be to encrypt the message digest with a
user-dependent secret key, but that would add a lot of time.  Maybe
there's an equally secure method which does not take as much time.

Actually there are two versions of pkunzip.exe, one with the -s scramble

without.  The one above is the export, and the full version is the same
date and time but the size is 23,528.
 
The European version identifies itself as version '1.1.' instead of '1.1',
and of course leaves out the -s option from the online help.  I have both
on my system, with the European renamed to euunzip.exe, and F-Prot 2.06a
proclaims both clean and here are the Validate codes, as well as 32-bit
CRC's of both files:

Maybe this is being greedy, but would it be possible for you to put a
switch into VIRSTOP that would force it to use the Secure scan
mechanism? I realise that this would result in a performance penalty,
but since it is only checking one file at a time this shouldn't be too
intrusive. The benefit would be enhanced security, particularly for
those who would not run F-Prot explicitly to scan their systems
periodically.

Thanks again for everything

   No, it is not really necessary to be a power user. If you use the
LABEL command with DOS 4.0 or above, it will update the BPB in the
boot sector.  DOS 4.0+ records the volume label at offset 2Bh in the
boot sector. If the integrity checker is using the complete BS when
calculating the signature, then it will issue a warning message.

I understand why you did it, I just don't agree with the result. The
log file is hidden away in a menu that a casual user will hopefully
never find. But for people who know the difference between R.A.M.  and
a Ram, I want that information. Thats why I bought Stiller's product.
I guess the main reason I want the information is because scanners are
only useful if the virus is already known or a close variant. But
change detection gives me a shot at protecting myself from the vast
unknown number of viruses.

Well, I don't have the entirety of the original sentence, so I might
be missing something, but, int 25h will let you read in the boot
sector, you modify it however, and rewrite it with int 26h.
 
Additionally, I have just recently seen some 486-50s with AMI BIOS's
(copyright 1992, I dont' know the exact date, though), that allow for
a "bootsector virus protection".  Which is somewhat funny.  Since I do
a lot of fdisking and formatting of drives on new systems, they scream
these messages, "Boot sector write - continue? (Y/n)" type of thing.
THe funniest thing, however, is that it didn't do that when I ran sys
on a hard drive.  In fact, they mean bootsector of floppy, or MBR on
hard drive.  For example, it would seem to me that Form would not be
detected when infected a hard drive, thought the floppy infection
would.  Maybe I should drag a copy to work and see what happens...

I downloaded the new OS/2 wares from Mcafee and had mixed results.
OScan discovered that there was stoned in two partitions on 120 meg
drive that was partitioned into a 40 and 80 meg C and D respective
drives.  The problem came into play when I cleaned using OSclean.  It
removed stoned but also removed the second partition loosing the 80
meg section.  This was in a single boot HPFS scenario.

Any thoughts on this would be appreciated.

Hello Alfred Jilka,

You write:

I thought these were fixed in the production version of the program, in case
not, it will be fixed in the next release.

>2) After scanning is finished, the program asks constantly if I want more
>help. "OS2SCAN C: D:" does not ask for help, does it?

Does this occur if you run OS2SCAN with the /NOPAUSE switch?  If not, then
OS2SCAN is simply prompting you because it has displayed 24 lines of text
on the screen and does not want to erase anything with a new page unless you
tell it to.

>3) Watching the filenames that pop up for short, I got the impression, that

Right now, there are no OS/2-specific viruses.  The main advantage of 
OS2SCAN (et al) is to be able to scan OS/2 HPFS systems for DOS viruses.
Support for these will be added in a subsequent release.

>4) Did you think of the built-in undelete-function ? I hope the /D switch
>works correct. You need to overwrite first, and then delete the file to en-

That's how it works in VIRUSCAN--I believe that this is not exactly 
possible under OS/2, but something like it is done to prevent virus-infected 
files from being undeleted.  If OS2SCAN can not delete a file, it will 
display a message warning that it can not overwrite-and-delete the file.

>5) A minor problem, but still annoying for OS2ers: VALIDATE should become a
>genuine OS2 program. For shure it does not need a fancy outfit, but why do I

An OS/2 specific version of VALIDATE, OS2VAL.EXE, is available with the
programs.  Did you download a beta-test version or production version of 
OS2SCAN?  Beta versions came with DOS VALIDATE (VALIDATE.COM), production
versions come bundled with the OS2VAL.EXE program.

>6) Another nice thing I miss is a background-scanner, that checks all in-

We are looking into the feasibility of doing this now.  Unlike DOS, there
are only a couple of books available on writing device drivers for OS/2,
currently.

>7) Maybe a kind of *.INI file could help to maintain the settings like drives

OS2SCAN creates an OS2SCAN.INI file when run with the /SAVE switch that
contains all that.  That was not available in the beta version.

>
>8) SCAN for DOS rel.9.0 V99 (most recent on Dec. 12th, 1992) does not do any-

We're looking into this now.  Should be fixed in the next release.

>9) In Virlist I found a passage for the fam*-viruses where no information
>is provided about their behaviour. Is this correct ? And if so, why ?

Subject: CHRISTMA EXEC wrap-up (CVP)

HISVIRN.CVP   921022
 
                           CHRISTMA EXEC
 
During the summer of 1988 there was considerable confusion regarding
the CHRISTMA EXEC.  This was "early days" for the virus field as a
whole, of course, and so there were the usual media reports
confusing microcomputers and mainframes, talking on the one hand
about international networks and on the other about disks being
erased.  One story describes the symptoms of the CHRISTMA EXEC while
at the same time talking about computerized medical systems being
sabotaged.  There was also a rumour among Mac users that CHRISTMA
was a Mac virus.  (I mean, it had to be IBM, right?  Who else uses
eight character filenames?  :-)
 
The author of the CHRISTMA EXEC was fairly quickly traced back to a
university computer in Germany.  The culprit's account was lifted. 
The NETLOG file that the EXEC used to obtain account and system
names is a transaction file that lists all mail sent and received. 
Therefore, while the file could be suppressed by some users, in most
cases an entry would show where the message had come from, and
confirm where it had been sent to.  Backtracking the infestation was
therefore relatively easy, even though the author had left no clues
in the program, and eventually the paths converged.  (This was a
good thing: this particular type of mail system does not carry the
same amount of header and "received from" information that others
may be used to.)
 
In fact, the author had not intended to cause any problems: he had
thought to send the greetings to his friends.  A second student used
the EXEC created by the first, with some slight modifications, and
didn't realize the havoc he was about to cause.  Fortunately, his
lack of programming expertise showed up in other areas: the
"parsing" of account info from the NETLOG file was faulty, and
reduced the traffic to only five percent of what it could have been.
 
Also, some copies never did get to reproduce, because they ended up
on incompatible systems.  One VMS user received six copies of
CHRISTMA.  Obviously, he never sent any on.
 
One of the frequently asked questions in the virus world is "has
there ever been a virus in a mainframe and can I can a scanner for
mine?"  CHRISTMA and the Morris worm are often used as examples of
viral programs on mainframes and networks (with the obligatory "it's
not a virus, it's a worm" pedantry), but the answer about scanners
is always "no".  This is not correct.  All major Bitnet backbone or
"core" sites run a "selective file filter" to catch any of the known
variants of CHRISTMA EXEC ... a scanner by any other name ...
