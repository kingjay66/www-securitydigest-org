As you are aware, I have spoken with our agents about quoting you or
using information from the Virus Test Center.  It could be that
NewBytes is referring to some old information.  Unfortunately, because
of the lead time involved in producing advertisements, it could be
that you are looking at material that is several months old.

We (the main office, that is) are very concerned about this and will
be checking with the agent to see exactly what happened.  I should
have more information by the end of next week.

This is a very common support problem in our part of the
world...people notice a file has grown by ~950 bytes, and send it in
for analysis. Of all such calls, perhaps one or two have ever admitted
to having run the TAV "immunise" utility; most deny it categorically!
I don't think they intend to lie -- I think they actually have no idea
what software they've used, and certainly no idea what the
side-effects of its various options are.

No wonder that viruses have such a strong foothold round here :-)

Subject: Is this a DOS virus? (PC)

	On one of our PC's we are observing some odd behaviour of our
DOS files.  The symptoms are: certain DOS files, share, dosshell and a
few others report that their size has been altered when I run a
CHKDSK.  Also we have been getting non-fatal errors during Windows
sessions.  In addition, one file reports that it has been "reallocated
to block 505."  I have ran F-prot 206, and pro-scan on it.  When they
read the files they report that the above files are "unreadable."
	I was wondering if anyone else is experiencing the same
behaviour, or if anybody has some ideas of what to look at.

Subject: does McAfee SCAN remove viruses? (PC)

    I recently got version 97 of SCAN and ran it on a 386 pc.  The pc
was STONED, and so I decided to check the disks that I had just used
in it (brand new harddrive so I knew that one of the disks was
infected)

I did a "scan a:" on a writeprotected DOS diskette.  After checking the 
640 k of memory, it prints:

  Virus removed.

Disk A: contains 2 directories and 7 files.

 No viruses found.

What's going on?

Can you please email a copy of the batch file you're trying to write?
I will take a look at it and see if I can find anything wrong with it.
In the meantime, you may want to get a copy of Microsoft Press'

I've had good success in solving batch file problems with it.

  Rick Wirthlin writes:
> I was wondering if anyone else is using the Untouchable virus scanner
> and how they find it.

This product was discussed here extensively about a year ago, so I'll
try to make this relatively brief.
  First of all, Untouchable is not itself a virus scanner in the usual
sense of the term, although it includes virus scanning modules (UTSCAN
and UTRES).  It is mainly an *integrity checking* package.  I'm not
sure whether you're asking specifically about those scanning modules or
whether you've confused the terminology and are really interested in
Untouchable as an integrity checker.
  UTSCAN has the ability to examine archives and compressed executa-
bles (recursively), includes one of the better MtE detectors (its
inability to detect some Groove mutations was corrected even before
Vesselin's report appeared), and is quite fast.  Moreover, the low
scores of previous versions of UTSCAN in terms of percentage of
viruses detected seems to be a thing of the past (the authors claim
that the latest version of UTSCAN scores higher on the CARO test suite
and disinfects more reliably than F-PROT 2.06a).  However, UTSCAN
requires a lot of RAM.
  The integrity checker UT is, in my opinion, excellent.  It is one of
the few which also perform generic disinfection.  Moreover, at every
stage in time, UT seems to detect some types of viruses which other
integrity checkers do not.  For example, even early (1988) versions of
UT (under the name "VirAlarm") were able to detect companion viruses,
which began to appear only in 1990 (most other integrity checkers
added this capability only after such viruses appeared, and quite a few
checkers can't detect them even today!), and UT still detects a couple
of types of viruses which have not yet appeared.

  I take this opportunity to say that imho, Robert Slade's recent
evaluation of Untouchable misses the mark.  I won't go into details
here, but in general, it gives more weight to lesser important things
(like the damaged diskette which he happened to receive, rarely needed
features of UT, and slowness on an XT) than to the really important
ones.  (I'd be glad to discuss these with you by personal e-mail, Rob,
if you're interested.)

As I said, John McAfee was -quoted- to have said that. Here is what
the article says:

    "If your product competes with mine, I'd like for those customers of
mine to know that your product isn't as good as mine," he [McAfee] said.

In the beginning I was sending them to you, since you were the person
from McAfee Associates who were most present on the net. I also used
to discuss the technical questions with Morgan Schweers, who was more
technically competent on the subject. Some time ago, you told me that
Igor is the one involved in the detection/disinfection problems, so I
should report such problems to him. He also told me to send copies of
such reports to him. That's what I am doing. If you insist, I'll send
them to you instead. However, I definitively refuse to send them
- - -twice-. Is the internal communication between the employees of McAfee
Associates really so bad? Isn't it enough that I am finding the bugs
in your software and sending you reports about that, so that you are
asking me to do it twice?

VIRUSCAN Version 97-B had a display bug that would cause it to
pop up a "virus removed" message after scanning memory for viruses
when run on a DOS 3.x system.  This was mentioned as a note in the
VIRUSCAN documentation under the WHAT'S NEW section.

The bug was fixed in the next release, Version 99.

Okay, John McAfee said that in the article, so?  That's called marketing,
and every software company does that in one form or another.  You could
probably remove John's name and fill it in with the CEO of any software
company, and it would still apply.  And if you don't like it?  Well, get
your marketing people to say the same thing.

Igor will be out of the office until December 14.  If you send email
to just him, it won't be read until he gets back from the EICAR conference.
If you send email to me, I can at least get our QA guy working on it so 
Igor will have report to look at when he returns.

It seems that the FAT on your hard drive has become corrupt.  DOS sometimes
does this all by itself, although there could be another cause.

When CHKDSK reports file size changes it means that the space allocated to
a file and the directory entry do not match.  CHKDSK will only make the
changes listed if you type CHKDSK /F, (beware there is a dangerous bug in
MS/PC-DOS 4 and 5 CHKDSK when using '/F' for certain drive sizes).

CHKDSK shortens files to match the disk space allocated.
Your best response is to:
1.  Delete all affected program files.
2.  Copy them back from a backup or reinstall from the original diskettes.
3.  If possible restore affected data files from a backup, or let CHKDSK
    shorten the files.

This confirms the above, these programs were unable to read all of the
file that they were expecting.

To help prevent recurrence, avoid excessive vibration of the computer
during use (eg move away from factory machinery), avoid switching off or
rebooting while the hard drive is in use (allow time for any disk write
caching software to empty it's buffers), perhaps get a mains filter plug
to reduce problems with the PC's power supply.

Hope this helps,

Ken De Cruyenaere asks

Speaking of native OS/2 applications, to my knowledge IBM has the only
shipping OS/2 antiviral product available.  The old version was called
simply the IBM Scanning Program.  They just came out with a new
version with a CUA interface called IBM AntiVirus/OS/2 (and a DOS
version too).  I have ordered this product but haven't received it
yet.  Dr. Solomon was supposed to have an OS/2 version of his product
available some time ago, but I don't think its seen the light of day
yet (maybe now that they've introduced their Windows version...).
Also, ASP says they will be coming out with an OS/2 version of their
Integrity Toolkit sometime.

Yes, I too wish that F-PROT, otherwise an excellent product, could be
modified to recognize the fact that it may be running on an OS/2
machine (from my perch of ignorance, it seems to me that it shouldn't
take more than a few lines of code).  Maybe Frisk is waiting for the
infamous "critical mass" of complaints.  :<)

You can find the McAfree and Virus Scan for OS/2 (BETA!) at
ftp-os2.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151) under /pub/os2/2.0/diskutils.  The
file you want is os_scb97.zip. You also need to use Info-ZIP's UNZIP
5.0 to unzip the files from this ftp site. I haven't had any problems
with the software on my FAT partitioned drives. Also this only runs
under OS/2 2.0 not 1.x.

I remember S&S announcing the AVTK shortly before OS/2 2.0 started to ship,
when I visited S&S during the summer Alan told me that developing the OS/2
version was a lot easier than for Windows.  I think it is shipping, and
therefore available from the usual places, (ie direct, dealers and overseas
agents), perhaps you should try emailing them:
    sands@cix.compulink.co.uk

Perhaps he's waiting for a "critical mass" of $'s to land on his doormat!
Then he can pay an extra programmer to help with the new development.


Hope this helps,

Subject: Wanted: Virus Scanner for HP Apollo 9000/7XX (UNIX)

	I'm looking for a virus scanner for our HP 7XX Unix boxes.  My
friendly HP representative says that there are none available, but I
find that hard to believe when IBM sends their RS/6000 out with
Viruscan.
	Can anyone help me out?

	How likely is it that a virus like Stoned, Michaelangelo, or
Brain (or any other DOS virus) can infiltrate HP-UX?  We do a lot of
transfers from PC to HP and the other way via floppy disk.

	Thanks a bunch.

The copy that showed up on my queue 12/9/87 (the 5th anniversary is
almost upon us) used "mohn tack jeah" for "month day year" and variable
names like "wer von wo ist rest", which agrees with this origin.

   The REXX exec actually invoked the SendFile command with the "ACK"
option, requesting delivery confirmation, adding to overall traffic.

 The last line of the one I got was "ERASE CHRISTMA EXEC", but that only
removed the file saved to disk (as the exec completed it's run).
Some users saw that line and disabled it before they ran it.
Others received the file, but did not run it.
In those cases, it remained on user disks.

Subject: Re: CHRISTMA DATA

We deleted our reference copy of CHRISTMA just a little while ago, now
I wish we hadn't so I could verify my information.  We had two copies
of it, one from the initial distribution and one from the second the
following year.  It could very well be that someone altered the
original program to erase itself in order to make it more difficult to
track down.

I do remember erasing copies of the program from users' minidisks and
also checking their netlog files to determine what other users had
been sent copies.  So our first version, at least, did not erase
itself.

Subject: Virus naming cross-reference updated (PC)

Hello, everybody!

I finally managed to update the virus naming cross-reference. A full
listing of the files in out collection, divided into boot sector
viruses, file viruses, trojans, jokes, etc.; information how the three
scanners with best detection rate call the different viruses (and
other pieces of malware); the standard CARO names; etc.

The three scanners used are:

	- Dr. Solomon's FindVirus 6.07 with drivers of 19-Nov-92.
	- F-Prot 2.06b
	- McAfee's VIRUSCAN 9.0V99

The first one is a commercial product. I have no idea what is the
actual version shipped to the customers; I used the latest version I
have received from S & S International.

The second product I have not yet seen this version on the usual ftp
sites; Frisk sent it directly to me.

The third product I have downloaded directly from McAfee's ftp site.

The last two product are shareware, as you probably all know.

A few people asked me why I do not include other scanners in these
comparative reviews. The answer is that they are NOT comparative
reviews. Their purpose is not to show which scanner is better
(although a lot of information about the scanner can be extracted from
them). Their purpose is to show the standard CARO names of all viruses
known to us (i.e., to VTC-Hamburg), together with a cross-reference of
how the three scanners with best detection rate are calling them. It
would be useless to include other scanners with a lower detection
rate, because they will give just no names for a serious part of the
viruses...

OK, the files are available from our ftp site,
ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de, in the /pub/virus/texts/tests
directory. Here is a short description of each of the archives:

reports.zip	- ASCII file, containing a multi-column listing (about
		  220 characters per line) of the file names, the 
		  standard CARO name of the virus in the file, the 
		  name used by Findvirus, the name used by F-Prot, and 
		  the name used by SCAN.

reps_ps.zip	- Same as above, but in PostScript, 4 bp.

naming.zip	- Four documents, describing the CARO virus naming
		  scheme and the names of every single boot sector and 
		  file infector, known to the VTC-Hamburg. Some other 
		  forms of malware are also listed.

namng_ps.zip	- Same as above, but in PostScript.

The listings are relatively up-to-date. They reflect the contents of
out virus collection on December 1st. However, there are about half a
dozen new viruses from Poland, which are not classified yet, and as I
am writing this a bunch of new viruses just arrived in the mail...
Sigh... :-(

Vesselin
