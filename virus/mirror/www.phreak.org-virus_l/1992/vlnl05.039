Michelangelo on ARTEC AM25 3-button mouse driver disk.

The BSI (Bundesamt fuer Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik) or
GISA (German Information Security Agency) just informed me that
the driver disks of the ARTEC AM25 3-button mouse were infected
with Michelangelo virus! These mice have been sold world wide. An
estimated number of 20000 in Germany! The disk is permanently write-
protected and 5,25" in size.
We urge customers, who bought this product to scan their PCs with an
uptodate scanner. We are currently investigating to find out if
other products of that company are also shiped with infected disks.

Ok folks, this has gone far enough to be confusing so lets sort itidation that
it is
installed ("type swvsvers" will return the logo if installed, fail if
not).

The "DIR" command supplied with DOS is smart enough to be able to separate
a real file from a device driver but many other programs are not - note
that the intercept only occurs if the explicit name is used - CON or
CLOCK$ will work, C* will not. This happens because the device driver
is doing the interception, not DOS, and it only reacts to an explicit
name, not wild cards.

Consequently, those programs that follow DOS rules or use the DOS "dir"
mechanism (DDIR - Double Dir is one) will not pick up device drivers.
Those that do not (e.g. SDIR - Sorted Dir) will display the driver.
Evidently, Norton's FF is one of this, as will probably be any program
which does not look for attribute bits.

Since these programs simply use DOS rules to change directory and then
look for the file, AUX, CON, or NUL for that matter will be found in
every directory and will probably report the current time and date.

Hopefully, this will answer the question.

Subject: WP.EXE appended to, up front (PC)

On Zenith XT hard drive:

We found several files on a directory with WordPerfect 5.0 with size
increases ranging from 380 to 3000+ bytes.

When the contents of WP.EXE were inspected, the bodies of several text
files (.BAT files from a different directory) were at the top of the
file, with names and a few bytes of data between them.  The names
were, like, "WP.BAT" in 6 characters, so not directory entries.
Format looked a little like WP .SET file entries, but no open space
(0's) between bodies of text.  The file started with the text of a
.BAT file, not its name. These were tightly packed (not caused by FAT
shuffling).  Not sure if original WP.EXE is still in there, but
suspect this strange data appended to the front of WP.EXE. File size
increased by 2101 bytes.

The .BAT files in that other directory were inspected.  They seemed to
have their old sizes (not confirmed, but about right) but their
content had been replaced by garbage (mostly null characters).  One
had all \0's except for a single 'Z' (5Ah). (These could have had
their directory entries changed (first cluster), all were smaller than
1 cluster, I think).

Other files on the WP's directory were also made bigger, by various
sizes (but didn't find text at front, maybe binary files appended to
front? anyway they grew) Help file, LEX, WP.FIL. File sizes grew by
various amounts, from 300 or so to 3000 or so bytes.

User was using WordPerfect OFFICE menu system to bring up WordPerfect
when the problem was noticed (if that's the word).

VI-SPY, F-PROT showed no known viruses (memory after boot on hard
disk, disk after boot from clean floppy).  Too neat to be a bug, eh?
It was a tough day.  Chasing this stuff isn't my job.

Your compiler is executing a program named "/tlink.exe" and VSHIELD is
picking this up and trying to run with it as an option.  This only
occurs when VSHIELD Version 86 or 86-B is run with the /SWAP mode.  It
will be fixed in the next release.

In the meantime, I'd recommend that you either load VSHIELD high with
a memory manager like QEMM, or create a batch file to run your
friend's compiler from that includes a statement to unload VSHIELD at
the beginning and re-install it afterwards.

Subject: Wierd Joshi (PC)

Hi!

I had a peculiar problem with Joshi on a disk.  This disk was a 3.5"
720K type, in drive B.  I was reformating some of my old disks.  After
doing a directory listing of the disk, I ran F-Prot (Ver 2.02D), and
found Joshi acitve in memory.  Before the directory listing, I know
the computer wasn't infected, as I had scanned just before that with
F-Prot.

I immediately powered down, and rebooted from a clean boot disk.  I
was expecting my hard disk to be infected as I had run F-Prot from my
hard-disk.  However, after booting and rigorous scanning with F-Prot,
McAfee Scan (86B) and Norton Anti-Virus (Ver 1.5), nothing was found
on the hard disk.  All the three scanners found Joshi on my floppy.

I performed another directory listing, with the same results.  On
further testing, I found that this happened only on computers
running DOS 5.0, both 286 and 386.  It did not occur on HP Vectras
running HP MS-DOS Ver 3.30, nor HP MS-DOS 3.20.  Even after
intensive usage, hard disk was not infected.  On changing the

However, the virus IS a strain of Joshi, and exhibits all its
characteristics after I attempt a boot from it (on a portable).  I
still have the disk with me and would be happy to send a copy to
anyone who truly needs it.

I always thought that boot sector viruses can only infect on an
attempted boot from a infected floppy.  Is this true?!  Can a
boot-sector-only-virus infect a computer through the B-drive.

I am also getting a false (at least, I think its false) positive
with the F-Prot on FORMAT.COM accompanying HP portables (Ver 3.20).
(this is not related to my above message)   Again, I can send a
copy of the program to anyone who needs to analyze it.

Hi!

I just sent a message a little while ago, about F-Prot giving a false
alarm on FORMAT.COM.  I forgot to say what the alarm is.  On HP DOS
Ver 3.20 accompanying HP portables, The FORMAT.COM is labeled as being
a "Joshi Dropper" by F-Prot 2.02D.

I shall format a disk using the file and see what happens.  The only
reason I am saying that its probably a false alarm is because none of
the other scanners I use (SCAN86B, and NAV1.5) pick it up.

Subject: Caching Removable Drives (PC)

Hi!

I use Norton Cache (Ver 6.01) to cache my floppy drives, as well as
the hard disk.  I understand and take all the necessary precautions
while using a cache on removable drives.  Scanning a bunch of
diskettes, I found that while running F-Prot (Ver 2.02D) in /MULTI
mode, or in the menu-driven mode, a change of disk was not
detected.  This can be a very serious problem as the scanner may go
on passing diskettes as clean, whereas they might not be.

F-Prot is the only software (anti-virus, and others) I have come
across till now that is unable to detect the disk change, while
running NCACHE.EXE.  I am in the process of contacting both
Symantec and Fridrik.  However, anyone else using a cache on a
removable drive may please be careful.

The last time I checked, Padgett's SafeMBR was not included in the
FIXUTIL's that he makes available.  Has it been replaced by another
program in the utilities?  Also, can someone tell me through
private mail the FTP site and directory at which Padgett's
utilities can be found.  On BitNet, it is very cumbersome to search
for a particular program using the FTP server at Princeton.

Subject: Michelangelo's handicaps. (PC)

In all the coverage about the Michelangelo virus I have missed a few
points.  I've browsed through the virus code and I've done a few (very
limited) tests with the virus on a PC. As far as I could tell (I
didn't go into it too deeply) the virus has two 'bugs'.

Bug 1:
The virus tells time (checks for march 6th) by checking the PC clock
via BIOS int 1Ah. This interrupt is available only in AT-compatible
computers and above.  Soit seems that the virus will not do its
destructive work on PC-type computers.  An attempt to trigger the
virus on an XT failed.

Bug 2:
I have been unable to infect 3.5" floppy disks (720's as well as
1.44's) other than by simply copying a 5.25" image over a 3.5" floppy.
This might lead to the conclusion that only systems with a 5.25" A:
drive can be infected.

The combination of these two bugs would lead to the conclusion that
only the owners of AT's (or higher) with 5.25" A: drives should fear
Michelangelo's birthday. IMO this disqualifies most of the computer
population.

I have to stress that these are the results of a test with only one
copy of the virus on only one computer system. So don't go trying it
out if you don't know exactly what you're doing.

Could anyone (in)validate or comment on these findings?

In most simple terms, you can think of the original boot sector as a
little program that diplays the "Non-system disk" message, and of the
infected boot sector as a not-so-little program that first infects the
hard disk and/or memory and subsequently diplays the "Non-system disk"
message.

Whether hard disk or memory or both are infected depends on the
particular virus; but in any case, infection happens before the
message is displayed.

Subject: re: Boot Sector Virus Infections (In General) (PC)

austin@tecnet1.jcte.jcs.mil asks if booting the machine with an
infected, but "non-bootable" floppy in the A-drive, then opening the
door and c-a-d'ing at the "Strike any key when ready..." prompt will
result in an infected hard disk.  The answer is yes, quite often, but
it depends on the virus.

Both the Stoned and the Michelangelo infect the hard disk during the
boot process; so as soon as you boot from an infected floppy
("bootable" or not), your hard disk is infected, and booting from it
puts the virus in memory (as does booting from an infected floppy, of
course).  Some other viruses, like the Joshi, for instance, only
infect the hard disk when something reads or writes the hard disk, so
if you boot from an infected floppy and *power off* before anything
reads or writes the hard disk, your hard disk is still probably clean
(although I personally would act as though it were infected; better
safe than sorry!).

Powering off is key, though; if the virus is in memory when you c-a-d,
all bets are off.  Some viruses, including the Joshi as I recall,
intercept the c-a-d sequence, and arrange to remain in memory.  So if
you boot from a Joshi-infected diskette, then open the door and c-a-d
at the "Strike any key" message, your hard disk will be infected
shortly thereafter (if I'm remembering correctly; I don't have Joshi
source at hand at the moment).

Unless you're actually doing direct anti-virus hacking yourself, it's
probably best not to try to remember all these details!  If you've
ever booted from an infected floppy, or used an infected program, you
should go into full "search and destroy" mode, and not try to figure
out exactly what might be infected and what might not; assume
everything is, scan it all, and clean up any hits that are found.
Anyone who's done much work with virus incidents will tell you that
the one floppy that you're *sure* "was never in the machine while the
virus was active" is the one that still has the virus on it, and will
lead to a reinfection next Tuesday...

   We (a Sandia Labs division) received several new 486/33 IBM compatibles
last week.  Immediately after powering up one system, a virus checker
(Central Point Anti Virus) was installed and run.  CPAV found and removed the
virus [Michelangelo].  The other new pc's were checked and the results were
the same.  The dealer was called, and he found the virus on his stock pc's.
(The dealer has expressed annoyance at my mentioning his name so I am not
going to mention any dealers' names.)
  [It bears note that the vendor wasn't checking or wasn't checking
  with an updated checker.  - grish]
The virus came with the MS DOS 5.0 sent to the dealer.
  [I would hope the vendor notifies his DOS dealer.- grish]
The dealer said that he would notify all of his customers.
   We notified computer security people at Sandia Labs, Los Alamos National
Labs, and UNM, since the virus may be on pc's from other dealers.
   I called four or five local computer dealers that I have dealt with in the
past.  Two of the dealers said that they had detected the virus about a month
ago and stopped it then.

Hi!

Christophe Meessen wrote sometime ago about the biological
interpretation of Polymorphic: A virus in which the outer shell has
changed its composition.  However, he says that this is not highly
accurate, as the code is unchanged.  However, I would say that it is
very accurate as the final executable code can be analogous to the
DNA, while the encrypted code is analogous to the virus complete with
its shell.

Thank you very much,

Regards,
