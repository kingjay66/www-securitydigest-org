VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  (The complete set of posting guidelines is available by
FTP on cert.sei.cmu.edu or upon request.) Please sign submissions with
your real name.  Send contributions to VIRUS-L@LEHIGH.EDU.
Information on accessing anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue
archives is distributed periodically on the list.  A FAQ (Frequently
Asked Questions) document and all of the back-issues are available by
anonymous FTP on cert.org (192.88.209.5).  Administrative mail
(comments, suggestions, and so forth) should be sent to me at:

Subject: More Administrivia - a few last minute FAQ mods

VIRUS-L/comp.virus readers:

As you can see, I'm sending out a couple batches of informational
postings today.  The first contain several product reviews from Chris
McDonald and Rob Slade (thanks guys, as always!).  After those have
moved through the mail queues, I'll send out the new FAQ document.

An error was spotted in the FAQ that I put on the FTP archive
yesterday.  (I inadvertantly used a copy of the FAQ that was not the
most current.)  I fixed the problem, and have updated the archive on
cert.org as well as the info file on listserv@lehigh.edu.  The
time/date stamp on the new one is: 18 November 1992, 7:45 AM EST.  If
yours is older than that, please update.

Side note: while I'm sending out these digests, I'm also doing a mass
cleaning of the mailing list.  Since I get about 50 bounces per
digest, I'm trying to strip off the addresses that have been
consistently bouncing.  Alas, it's a losing battle.

Thanks,

Ken

General Description:
 
Scanning, resident scanning and disinfection capabilities.  The informational
utilities present in the earlier (1.xx) versions have been replaced by
heuristic analysis scanning.  Change detection and operation restricting
utilities have been removed and not replaced.
 
 
                  Comparison of features and specifications
 
 
 
User Friendliness
 
Installation
 
Installation is now added as a feature in the main program.  Manual
installation is still an option, and is likely the one most used by those
familiar with the program.  Since the program is shareware, and since
installation is little more than copying of files, unless VIRSTOP is installed,
it is unlikely to present any problems.
 
In the automated installation, VIRSTOP is installed to be invoked from
AUTOEXEC.BAT.  Those wishing to invoke it from CONFIG.SYS must do the
installation manually.
 
Ease of use
 
Except for resident scanning, F-PROT is now invoked from a single program.  The
user, by default, is presented with a graphical interface, but command line
switches are an option for those wanting more speed, or a standard invocation
for a large group of users.
 
There is no "help" key, but the options are fairly simple, and explained in
text boxes where necessary.
 
Help systems
 
There is no help per se, although a listing of command line switches is
available.
 
Compatibility
 
F-PROT consistently maintains the highest ratings in all independent tests of
scanning of known viral programs, including my own.  In terms of disinfection
capability, only Alan Solomon's Anti-Virus Toolkit has similar ratings.
 
Because of an external language file, F-PROT is available in at least six
languages, and can be readily translated into others.
 
Sporadically, F-PROT will fail to scan large drives which are divided into
multiple partitions.  This problem is fairly rare.  It has been addressed, but
it is unknown as to the success in all situations.
 
There have been ongoing reports of problems installing the VIRSTOP resident
program under MS-DOS 5.0.  Moving VIRSTOP in the boot sequence, particularly
with respect to memory managers, generally is successful in alleviating the
problem.
 
The heuristic analysis portion of the program occasionally generates a "false
positive" alert about a program that is not, in fact, infected.  This is to be
expected from this type of scanning, and the incidence is much reduced from
when this function was first included with the program.  The heuristic analysis
feature has been generally effective in identifying new and "unknown" viral
strains, but is not perfect.  (Perfection is, of course, inherently
unattainable in this type of program.)  Indeed, the documentation for this
feature states that it is still to be considered experimental, and is very
conservative in its claims.  Programs known to cause false positives are
listed.
 
F-PROT may be run under Windows, but is not a Windows program.  This is planned
to be addressed in future, as are improvements for VIRSTOP to make it run with
Windows, and to check files as they are copied, to check floppy disks as
accessed, and to use EMS memory.
 
Company Stability
 
Fridrik Skulason has left the university, and is concentrating full time on the
research and development of this product.  His company now employs four staff
in addition to himself.  F-PROT is being included in commercial programs, and a
commercial version of F-PROT will be announced shortly.  frisk has, however,
committed to continuing to support the shareware version.
 
Company Support
 
Fridrik Skulason is available through the Internet, and replies to queries can
be expected within a week or less.  Recently the program has become much more
popular with the general public, and numerous people have requested his Fidonet
address.  Unfortunately, frisk is not active on either Fidonet or VirNet.
 
Documentation
 
Being shareware, the package has no printed documentation.  The text files
included with the programs are very clear and thorough, and provide an
excellent primer on virus functions and protection, as it relates to scanning
and disinfection.  The large single USAGE.TXT file has been broken into smaller
"chapter" files, which allows for quicker access to a particular function or
feature.
 
As some of the other virus detection and prevention capabilities have been
dropped from the package, so the very excellent discussions of the different
types of antiviral software, and their strengths and weaknesses, have been
dropped from the documentation.  It is recommended that interested parties
obtain old (1.xx) versions of F-PROT for this material.
 
The virus information files previously contained in separate text files have
been included as a virus information feature within the main program.
 
Hardware Requirements
 
No special hardware is required.
 
Performance
 
During testing, FPROT has consistently identified more viri than the "current
release" of any other product.  FPROT is generally slower at scanning because
of the multiple signatures being used to check for each virus, but is not the
slowest scanner tested.
 
The user is in control of FPROT at all times, with the exception that
VIRSTOP will not allow the boot sequence to continue in the case of a boot
sector infection at startup.
 
FPROT, in two years of my testing, has not given a false positive alarm on any
normal program, nor has it interfered with any normal program operation.
 
The various functions and utilities that have been dropped from the 2.xx
version programs still have significant value.  Serious virus researchers and
consultants would do well to obtain copies of older (1.xx) versions.  These
have been retained, and are available, at better antiviral source sites.
 
Local Support
 
Since FPROT is shareware, there are no local dealers to obtain support from. 
FPROT has fewer users in North America than SCAN, and so local help may be
harder to obtain, but the documentation should make up any deficiencies.
 
For users in Europe, FPROT is available in places as a commercially distributed
product.
 
Support Requirements
 
Very little support should be needed for this program.  On occasion assistance
my be needed in disinfection, or in positively identifying a new viral strain,
but no product tested deals with this situation better than F-PROT.
 
                                 General Notes
 
Because of its "shareware" distribution, FPROT is best compared against John
McAfee's SCAN program.  F-PROT is kept up to date with regular additions to the
signature file, and constant improvements to the program.  SCAN versions are
released at approximately the same frequency as FPROT, but in two and a half
years FPROT releases consistently identified more viri, and with greater
accuracy than did the "same level" releases of SCAN.  SCAN also needs to
release far more "bug fix" versions than does F-PROT.  Fridrik Skulason
publishes fewer signatures of new viri on the VIRUS-L (Usenet comp.virus)
distribution lists than he used to, but some others are supplying appropriate
signature strings in his format.  F-PROT is significantly cheaper than the SCAN
suite as well, and is complete in one package, although the SCAN suite in total
now offers some edge in utility.
 
I am personally sorry to see that the former utilities are not included in the
current package.  However, it is unarguably simpler for novice users to install
and use the newer package, free from the confusion of the multiplicity of files
contained in the previous version.

General Description:
 
SAFE is a security system primarily directed towards restriction of access. 
This does provide some protection against modification of program files, but
the system is not an "antiviral" package per se.  It is reviewed here in the
interest of completeness.  Because of this, numerous "failings" are reported
here that have no bearing on the suitability of the package in its intended
role.
 
                  Comparison of features and specifications
 
 
 
User Friendliness
 
Installation
 
The product is shipped on unprotected 3.5" (720K) disks.  Reference is made in
the installation manual to a "token reader", but this was not included with the
evaluation unit.
 
"Automated" installation is the only option.  Installation instructions are
given in both the "Installation Guide" and the "Quick Installation" pamphlet. 
One of these *must* be read.  Failure to read the instructions may result in an
improperly installed system, and one which may impair system operation.
 
This is odd, given that the installation process is so highly automated.  For
example, the computer is rebooted twice during the installation process.  The
first time is handled completely by the installation program.  The computer is
rebooted, and continues with the installation.  This requires no operator
intervention.  The second time, however, the user is instructed, very tersely,
that the system is *not* installed, and to follow the "next" step in the
installation process.  Study of the installation guides reveals this to be the
running of the security setup, which installs user accounts.  Given that the
system comes with default accounts, and that the "Quick Installation" suggests
that you use them, the system should be able to proceed to that point and
prompt the user for a choice.
 
If the user does not take this further step, the system is, in fact, partially
installed, contrary to what the user has been told.  In addition, at this point
the program will not remove itself through the "Remove" option on the menu.  It
gives the terse, and as it turns out erroneous, message that the path to the
SAFE directory is incorrect.  There is a RECOVERY batch file which can be used
at this point.  A further reboot and run of the CLEANUP batch file are needed
in order to fully restore the system to normal operation.
 
Ease of use
 
In common with most security systems, SAFE requires a lot of thought.  The
program interface is not hard to figure out, but the setup of access rules is
not going to be an easy task.
 
Help systems
 
None provided.
 
Compatibility
 
SAFE requires removal of all other antiviral security before installation.  All
TSRs must also be removed, and added to the system after installation.  An
exception to this appears to be mouse driver software.
 
SAFE requires that disk maintenance and repair utilities not be used once the
system is installed.  There may also be conflicts with memory managers and
programs requiring certain keystrokes.
 
Company Stability
 
Unknown.
 
Company Support
 
Unknown.
 
Documentation
 
The documentation is extremely daunting, even for those familiar with
installation and administration manuals on mid-range computers.  I was, for a
time, unsure as to whether I did, in fact, have an MS-DOS version of the
product for evaluation.  A "Quick Installation" pamphlet is provided which does
guide the user through the steps for installation.  In fact, the main
documentation recommends that "software evaluators" use the quick installation
without reference to the other documentation.  While it is true that this will
perform a successful installation, it by no means provides sufficient
information for an informed review of the product.
 
As well as the "Quick Installation" and some other reference cards, there are
three manuals in the documentation.  The "Installation Guide" lists the
installation requirements, the steps necessary to install the program, and some
options for customization.  The "User Guide" describes installation and use of
SAFE on a standalone machine or network, while the "Administrator Guide" deals
with security at a "corporate" level.
 
It is unlikely that even the advanced user will fully appreciate the
ramifications of the "Installation Guide" unless the other manuals are read as
well.  Although the directions for installation are explicit and clear, there
is almost no description of what the installation of SAFE does to the computer
system.
 
The "User Guide" contains a section with a general discussion of data security
"concepts".  This leads into a short section on SAFE "concepts", but still
gives little information regarding the operation of the program itself.  There
is extensive discussion of access "rules", and the interface of the program
itself.
 
The "Administrator Guide", interestingly, is almost a carbon copy of the "User
Guide" except for the added sections dealing with the Global User Setup and
Audit programs.  No further details are available regarding what it is that
SAFE actually does, and how.  Assessment of the actual strengths of the system
can therefore only be determined by experimentation.  It is obvious that
Micronyx believes firmly in security by obscurity.
 
Hardware Requirements
 
An MS-DOS computer with version 3.3 or higher, 640K memory, a floppy disk
drive, and a hard disk with 6 megabytes of free space.  (Once installation is
complete, approximately 2.4 MB of files may be removed.)  Note that if only
640K memory is available, SAFE occupies 62K.
 
Performance
 
The operation restricting aspects of the system should be able to prevent
infection by most file infecting viral programs.  However, the fact that
protection is file based does not seem to help with protection against boot
sector infectors.  (The hardware requirements of the system prevented full
testing of this, but the initial results indicated that infection of the hard
disk was not prevented.)  Additionally, the system does not appear to protect
against FAT (or "system") viral programs, nor against "companion" viri.
 
Local Support
 
None available.
 
Support Requirements
 
SAFE is a security system, and the "virus protection" component is really
incidental to that.  Setup of the security system will require assistance by
those experienced in security matters.  This is not a system to be handed to
the novice, or even intermediate, user.

The V.I.R.U.S./Virus Doctor BBS List
 
For sorting purposes the wide variety of bracket, slash, space and
hyphen placement have been replaced with the European standard
"global" area codes.  I have used hyphens instead of blank spaces when
separating the "global", "country" and "city" codes.  Every phone
number begins with the global area code; this code is "1" for USA and
Canada.  To prevent misinterpretation, the global area code is
preceded with a "+" sign, and delimited by a hyphen.  The (national)
area code is delimited from the local phone number by another hyphen.
(Thanks to Otto Stolz for his assistance.)
 
In order to avoid line wrap on Fidonet mail readers, the "node number"
has been "right justified" at 75 columns.  For those on the Internet,
it is possible to send mail to these systems.  The node number is in
the format <zone>:<net>/<node> and can be converted to an Internet
address as user.name@f<node>.n<net>.z<zone>.fidonet.org so that Rob
Slade may be reached at The Cage (1:153/733, see "+1-604") as
Rob.Slade@f733.n153.z1.fidonet.org or at Cardz as
Rob.Slade@f7050.n153.z1.fidonet.org or at Deep Cove as
Robert.Slade@f915.n153.z1.fidonet.org
 
Key:
 
AM = Amiga          AT = Atari          MC = Macintosh          PC = MS-DOS
Fidonet echoes carried:  VIRINF = VIRUS_INFO   VIR = VIRUS   WRN = WARNINGS
Files archived: CVP = Computer Viral Programs column  RVW = Antiviral reviews
 
Where verification is possible, the "node number" is followed by a "V" and the
initials of the reviewer.
