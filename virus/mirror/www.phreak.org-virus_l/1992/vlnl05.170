Subject: WARNING - Proto virus hoax (PC)

A number (!) of people have forwarded a bboard posting to me regarding
a new virus known as PROTO-T.  By all reputable accounts, these
messages appear to be a hoax, intended to stir up the "rumor mills".
Thus, until and unless I hear otherwise from a reputable and
verifiable source, I am going to reject all subsequent postings
related to this "virus".

Please people, help stop the rumor mills.  They are counterproductive
and not in the best interest for anyone.

Thanks for your cooperation,

Well, I have no information on the particular product mentioned, but I
am working in the virus field since four years, and all my experience
tells me that the above claim is completely bogus. There is NO WAY to
protect a PC against all current and future viruses, and still leave
it usable. The nearest thing is to have a system with no writable
media, with all software pre-installed (and guaranteed virus-free).
Under no conditions should you write-enable any of the disk drives
(including the floppies) of such system. It will stop all viruses, but
I doubt very much that many people will find such a system useful.

You are partially right about CatchMtE. I expected the author of the
product to post the correction, but since he didn't and I consider the
matter to be important, I am going to do it here.

Version 1.4 of CatchMtE has a bug which prevents it from properly
finding the entry point of some EXE files. This, of course, can
prevent it from detecting the MtE-based viruses in such files. The
author uploaded a bug fix. Version 1.5 is available from our ftp site
(ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de:pub/virus/progs/catch15.zip). It is one
of the 4 MtE detectors that passed our MtE detection tests.

I have no proof that CatchMtE 1.5, F-Prot 2.05, and FindVirus 6.01 are
able to detect the MtE-based viruses with 100% reliability. All I can
say is that they were able to detect all samples used in the tests
(15,994). However, I do have a proof that SCAN 97 does NOT detect the
MtE-based viruses reliably. The same is true for several other
scanners. If you have any proof that the three programs mentioned
above also fail to detect the MtE-based viruses reliably, you are
welcome to contact me, and you are advised to contact the authors of
the mentioned scanners.

Just some more information. Of the above missed samples, 141 (of 142)
Questos were unencrypted and 143 (out of 145) correctly infected
Groove EXE files. The fact that they are unencrypted, means that they
can be easily detected, if SCAN contained a signature, picked from the
body of the MtE (not from the body of the particular virus). This is
so obvious, that I cannot figure out why SCAN is not doing it
already... Let's hope that it will be included in the next version.

Meanwhile, this still holds. A total of 33 of the missed samples were
encrypted. They represent ALL of the 7 different viruses used during
the tests, which means that SCAN 97's MtE detection algorithm still
has bugs, which prevent it from detecting ANY for the MtE-based
viruses reliably.

Subject: Re: cascade virus info wanted. (PC)

Hi Lachlan,

There are 3 variants of Cascade and they all infect .COM files only.

The virus replaces the first 3 bytes of the .com file is replaced by a
jump to the start of the virus, which is encrypted bar the first 35
bytes using an algorithm that includes the length of the host program
( so every example 'appears' different ).  It loads as a TSR when the
.com is run and will infect EVERY .com file run, even if it has an
.exe extension.  The 3rd version of cascade has been modified to
format the hard-disk using the routine from the DataCrime virus.

Length of versions:  1 = 1701, 2 & 3 = 1704.

Note: Recognition of the virus depends upon it's length therefore it
      will re-infect .com files that are already infected with cascade
      variants.

Good luck,  Jim.

Have you tried booting from a DOS boot disk and then using the SYS
command to replace the DOS boot sector on the hard disk with a clean
one from the floppy by typing "SYS C:"?

The Cascade virus is a memory-resident .COM file infector that
increases file size by 1,701 or 1,704 bytes, depending on which
version of the virus is present.

The virus gets its name from causing characters to fall down to the
bottom of the screen during October through December of 1988.

If you need more information, please feel free to send mail.

The Cansu or V-Sign virus is a floppy disk boot sector and hard disk
master boot record (partition table) infector.  You should be able to
remove it with the DOS SYS command from floppies and MS-DOS 5.00 FDISK
command with the undocumented /MBR switch, which refreshes the MBR
code while leaving the data portion--the actual partition
table--intact.  Alternatively, CLEAN-UP V97 will remove it with the
[Cansu] I.D. code.

Given the nature of virus-scanning software, it is often difficult to
determine if one has the latest version.  At the time Vesselin's
message did appear in comp.virus, a new release of VIRUSCAN (SCAN) had
been made.  If one is going to write a review or evaulation or report
on anti-viral software, it would be a good idea to check with the
developer before going to press to see what the current version is.
Then the review can either be held to a new version is tested, or a
note can be added that a new version has been released which has not
been tested (but will be shortly, no doubt :-).

We neither approve or pay for advertising done by our agents--this is
done by them individually.

If you or Vesselin or anyone else has a complaint about advertising
done by one of our agents, the correct person to contact is either the
agent himself (or herself) to resolve the issue.  If unsatisfied,
contact the International Agents Program Manager, Jim Lynch.  Jim can
be reached at telephone (408) 980-3611 or by fax at (408) 970-9727.

Based on the subject and volume of messages appearing lately, it would
appear that a vendetta is being persued against McAfee Associates,
solely on the basis of an advertisement made by an outside agent.

This is unbecoming behavior for any professional and an inappropriate
use of the comp.virus newsgroup / VIRUS-L digest.

This sounds like a variant of the Michelangelo virus that we received
a few days ago.  Apparently the virus corrupts some of the information
in the BIOS Parameter Block--the portion of the DOS Boot Sector that
tells DOS what the rest of the disk should look like.

I was under the impression that CLEAN-UP V97 added removal for this
variant, but then again, it may have appeared after V97 was released,
in which case the next release of CLEAN will take care of it.

No.

Well you can also try F-Prot on the disk. I've found it more reliable
when detecting questionable files. Atleast it gives me a hint as to
where to start looking at. Although I've never had a problem with SCAN
except the OLD versions, I still prefer to use both just incase.

As for if it's a virus or disk error, it could be either. If it
crashes during your config.sys file, it is difficult to tell. Usually
it will give you Retry, Ignore, Abort, Fail? though. If you have
something such as SpinRite, or Norton Disk Doctor, I would recommend
running it on the disk. SpinRite is not able to fix all disk types,
but it does a good job usually.

Good luck.

Hello Rob,

In article <0007.9210281923.AA20912@barnabas.cert.org> you write:

>When I use VSACN and specify the /CKHIGH (I think) option

When SCAN is run with the /CHKHI switch, it actually checks base
(system) memory from 0-640Kb, upper memory from 640-1,024Kb, and the
high memory area from 1,024-1,088Kb (actually less 16 bytes which are
used to control access to that region).

These are all areas that can be accessed by DOS (with appropriate
drivers, such as HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE, or third-party memory
managing products such as QEMM, 386^MAX, and so forth).

While some programs do take advantage of memory above this region,
they do not so much actually execute stored above that 1,088Kb region
then bankswitch it in and out of the lower regions.  Because of this,
there are no reasons to check above the 1,088Kb region for viruses--of
course, if someone writes a virus that does work in extended or
expanded memory, we will add detection of it.

My general rule of thumb is, if you can cold boot the infected PC from
a clean copy of DOS and then change over to the hard disk and perform
a DIR or look at files, then the partition table on the hard disk is
okay and it is safe to use FDISK /MBR.  Of course, one has to boot
from a floppy diskette with the same (or higher) version of DOS as the
one on the hard disk, otherwise it may not be possible to access the
hard disk at all.

Probably from VSUM - and probably of the same accuracy as the rest of the
information there :-)

Well, I can think of one possibility...

If the virus is a stealth virus, or even just a semi-stealth virus,
which intercepts FindFirst and FindNext operations, in order to
subtract its own size from the size of infected files, and if the
person doing the testing runs CHKDSK with the virus active, CHKDSK
might report allocation errors, because the number of clusters
allocated can be higher than the number of clusters actually needed.

Actually, no damage has been done - and no damage is done, unless
CHKDSK is run with the "/F" switch.  It claims to "repair", but will
only damage the infected files, making proper recovery difficult or
even impossible.

I believe this is why Patty reports many viruses as causing allocation
errors, when this is not the case.

Hello Nikolaj,

In article <0018.9210271550.AA18013@barnabas.cert.org> you write:
>I recently got the McFee Scanv97 for Windows.  I'm running OS/2, but
>when I want to run WSCAN I get the message that I cann't run the
>program in a WINOS2 session.....


WSCAN shells to DOS, which is something that WINOS2 does not directly support.
I believe instructions for tweaking WINOS2 to allow this can be found in
comp.sys.os2.* FAQ list.

SCAN for OS/2 is finishing up its beta-test period and should be available
in 1-2 weeks.  In the meantime, try running the DOS version VIRUSCAN (SCAN).
You'll need to use the /UNATTEND switch to tell it to skip over the hidden
system files on your boot drive, else you'll receive an error message from
OS/2 when SCAN attempts to check them.

Subject: Non-corrupted - Questions on the "Batman" virus (Atari ST)

Ignore the last message that I sent to VIRUS-L, it looked like it got
corrupted.

The message was supposed to be as follows:

On the Atari ST a bootsector has to have a checksum of $1234, if it is
to execute when the machine is booted. Viruses, Virus-protectors &
Games all use bootsectors which have a checksum of $1234. If a
bootsector does not have the checksum it will not execute.

There is a virus on the ST called the "Batman" virus which according
to ST Format (UK computer mag) does not have an executable bootsector
yet the virus still manages to enter the system at boot up!

How does the "Batman" virus boot without an executable bootsector?

I"m not a lawyer, but surely the report forwarded by Dennis Clouse
about Accolade disassembling Sega's code has big implications for
copyright generally?  If you can copy code for such purposes ("as long
as those games did not copy Sega games" surely you can copy text too,
as long as the final product is not identical to the original?

(btw does the San Francisco Examiner really not know the difference
between "its" and "it's"? :-)

Subject: List of Virus Books and Book Reviews

Can anyone tell me if there is a repository on the 'net that has a
comprehensive list of books and periodicals specifically relating to
computer viruses.  I'm most interested in books and magazines in the
popular press, but if you have other lists, I'll take them too.

I'd also like to know there is anywhere on the 'net (or anywhere else
for that matter) that has the text of reviews of antivirus books.

E-mail is fine.  If there's an interest, I'll post the results.

Thanks,
