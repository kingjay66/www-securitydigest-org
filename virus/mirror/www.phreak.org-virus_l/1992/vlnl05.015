VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  (The complete set of posting guidelines is available by
FTP on cert.sei.cmu.edu or upon request.)  Please sign submissions
with your real name.  Send contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU
(that's equivalent to VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).
Information on accessing anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue
archives is distributed periodically on the list.  Administrative mail
(comments, suggestions, and so forth) should be sent to me at:
krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: Leading Edge distributes Michaelangelo virus

Between 10 and 27 December 1991, Leading Edge Products shipped up to 6000
IBM-compatible personal computer systems each of which included among the
hard-disk software the Michaelangelo virus -- which wipes the hard disk on the
artist's 6 March birthday, although it also has some earlier destructive
effects as well.  [See San Francisco Chronicle, 25 Jan 1992, p. B1]

Subject: New virus????? (PC)

I have a question it seems that I have come across some sort of virus.
My Dos Machine has in every directory a file called aux. It seems also
that you can't find it by normal means. I guess the best way to find
it is to use any editor(edlin, edit, vi, etc..) to look at it, but
what you actually get is a computer freeze.

You could also try to rename a file to aux and you will some sort of
duplicate file error.

Each aux file is about 112 bytes long.

It doesn't seem to be malicious aside from taking up space but I can't
even look in the file and try to dump the contents onto a file or
something. And scanv85 doesn't find it.  Same thing with CPAV. If
anybody knows something about this all your help will be greatly
appreciated.

We sorted this out with him yesterday. The final result is: 3
different variants.

In my original posting I also forgot to say that the virus does not
infect files with 8-character names, due to a bug...

No, it can't. Actually, data can be transmitted in both direction
through both ports (serial and paralel), but an external device has no
way to -FORCE- the computer to accept any data the latter is not
willing to. It would be possible, if a special program already runs on
the computer. Say, a software device driver for the printer, which
secretly downloads a virus from the printer's ROM. This is possible,
but just useless - why not imbedding the virus in the device driver in
the first place? No, there is no way an external device to force your
computer to accept data, unless there it a program already running,
which plays the active part.

I didn't say NO because it's on a chip. I said NO, because it is
introduced by an external device.

Right. You just don't have a way to make the computer download all
this nasty code. No way from the printer, that is.

As several people already mentioned, it has been published in the
Aprit 1st issue of InfoWorld (1991). Even the virus there is called
AF/91, that is April's Fool / 1991. As you can see, even CNN can get
cought... And it was not alone in this case, believe me... :-)

Pentagon and Keypress viruses were found on floppys in one of our labs.

Pentagon virus was NOT FOUND by SCANv84, but it was found with SCANv69.

This could be a problem. We did not allow that person to use his disk in
the lab.

I wasn't there, so I didn't analize it further.

A program that collects logins and passwords by masquerading as a

week at the University of Illinois on PCs at sites used by large
numbers of students. The information below was posted by the CCSO

Subject: Green Caterpillar Virus (PC)

Dear all,

I have just found the Green Caterpillar virus (1575/1591), and would like
some information about it.
Firstly, which machines are vulnerable to infection, and on which machines
does the payload work? How many strains are there?
Secondly, and more generally, I tried to activate the virus on a PC running
DR-DOS 6 (with a compressed disk). I wasn't able to infect any files. I know
the virus spreads via the Findfirst and Findnext calls. Is DR-DOS immune in
some way?

Many thanks,

Christopher J. Wells.

Subject: Total memory available to DOS less than 655360 (PC)

    After reading the note by Padgett Peterson about the
    Michelangelo virus, I checked my machines and found
    that one of them (a 486/33MHz clone AT with 8M ram)
    reports total memory = 654336 = 655360 - 1024 when
    booted from drive C: and 655360 when booted from A:

    No other symptom of infection can be observed. (and
    SCAN '85 reports "no viruses found")

    Does someone know if there is a possible cause of this
    behaviour, other than infection?

I more or less write this to prove that Amiga-owners read this channel,
although there isn't much amiga-related stuff here.

I havn't had much problems with viruses recently. The only virus got last
year was a lamer-exterminator, and I think I used BootX to remove it.

I think that more Amiga-owner ought to write to this channel, to share
the latest info. about viruses.

After having sent my last response to this, I had second thoughts.  I am 
still not sure that I understand the question, but the poster may be 
referring to virus signatures, the specific sections of code used to 
identify a virus or infection.

Was this meant as a joke? I was missing the ":-)"
Just in case this was not a joke, the "signature" virus is nothing
but a joke. Many people are putting a text like "This is a .signature
virus. Please copy me into your .signature file" or the likes. A
.signature file is of course the signature that is appended to e-mail.

BTW, as a joke I devised an anti-signature-virus: "rm -i .signature".
It's just about as intellegent as doing a low-level format to cure
a file virus.

Cheers, Morton

Some time ago willimsa@unix1.tcd.ie (alastair gavi williams) happily mumbled:

Greetings!

    A .signature virus is a voluntary self-inflicted virus, requiring
the consent of the to-be-infected to spread.

    It's a Usenet joke.  (IMHO, a pretty funny one.)  After all, it's
non-destructive, clearly announced, and requires user intervention to
become "infected".  It's easy to scan for, as well!  *grin*

    Removal of a .signature virus under Unix requires the use of an
extensively technical Unix virus-removal program, such as 'emacs' or
'vi'.  Less technical methods may be used ('ed', or 'ex'), and in the
worst case a low level format of your .signature file may be required.
('cat > .signature').

    .signature viruses are unique in that they can spread to
non-similar file systems.  (The only requirement for spreading is a
similar user mindset, across which the virus has ease spreading.)
Removal under other file systems may require different techniques than
under Unix.  For example, VMS comes with a easy-to-use .signature
virus removal program named EDIT.  Even old MS-DOS systems have the
easy capacity to remove this virus through the use of the arcane
'EDLIN' command.  Modern versions of the MS-DOS .signature virus
remover contain a full screen visual interface.

    I'm not certain as to its efficacy spreading to non-text-oriented
brainsets (such as Amiga and Mac users), but I'm sure that with a
sufficiently interested and consenting user, something could be
arranged...

    Enjoy!

Subject: Iraqi Virus Question?

Hello All

 I have been watching in the list the message treads on the Iraqi printer
virus, and I have a question to pose to the group.

	1. Postscript printers receive printouts in the form of Postscript
	   Program Code, which is in turn run by the printer to printout
	   the Page. Now if that Postscript printer is on a Network and
	   is capable of sending information to the network, then could
	   the printer CPU be programmed to access the well known and
	   some not so well known security features of the network to
	   plant code or overload the system with bogus traffic.

 I know that this requires the information on the type of network and
the types of computing platforms in use, but seems to me that they
bought most of thier computers from us, over the last 10 years and it
would only be smart for one of the watchers (CIA, FBI, NSA, DIS) to
keep track of this.

This is of course is my own ideas, guesses, or what ever.
