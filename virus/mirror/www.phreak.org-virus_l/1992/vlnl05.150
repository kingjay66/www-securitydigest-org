Subject: tbscanx41 and scan95 ! (PC)

Hello...

     I was working on my computer...and had tbscanx41 resident when i
tried scan95 (new!) for the first time....and it found Israeli Boot
virus..  in the boot sector!

     I though it was real, but I wanted to see if it was true...
     I disactivated tbscanx41 and run scan95 .....guess what ??

                         NO VIRUS FOUND !!

    I ran tbscanx41 again...then scan c:....and again found virus..

    CONCLUSION...: scan95 and tbscanx41 DON'T work good together!


 Is it a bug...?  (must be)

thanks..

Subject: "New" 1530 virus ? (PC)

 A new virus has turned up on our campus.

McAfee v95 identifies it as "1530" but will not clean it.

CPAV (1.2) does not detect it.

 F-PROT (V2.05) does not detect it (even in HEURISTICS) (!)
 When infected, VIRSTOP does note that it has been changed and tells
one to  boot from a clean diskette, but VIRSTOP doesn't stop the boot
at that point (?!).

 It appears to infect .EXEs and .COMs.  It seems to go for
COMMAND.COM first.  Infected files increase in size (by apprx 1960)
but the date doesn't change.

 The following search string seems to be unique to the virus:
 06 56 57 50 53 51 52 8C DE
 (but hasn't been tested very thoroughly at this point)

Your approach will fail to detect a stealth virus like 1963 or dir2.
To be on the safe side you will have to read the directory using absolute read
(int 13h) and follow the FAT chains yourself. Of course it might be useful to
check whether the interrupt vectot of int 13h still points to the BIOS area.

Use any CRC check with an UNUSUAL (i.e. rarely used) polinomial.

I'm quite sure that this is just a false alarm. Crew is not known
outside Finland (although I suspect it has been made in Germany). It
is very slow infector (it infects only .COMs bigger than ~10 kb if the
month is January-May), so it doesn't have too many chances to spread
widely.

You can check the files if they have Crew infection or not by looking
at the end of them. If you can find a big ASCII graphic logo with
texts like 'Notice this: TS ain't smart at all!' etc. But, in case
Crew has reached out to the USA, it might be a new version of it.

If this turns to be a real Crew infection instead of being a false
alarm, I'd like to hear more about it...

If the 'azusa' virus is haunting you, you should check all
floppies before using them.

We discovered the virus here about 1 1/2 years ago.  We also
discovered the source.  The virus was located on factory write
protected software.  This software was Tridents TVGA 8800 or 8900
driver disk (I don't remember which right now).  If you are using an
older Trident driver disk, I would definitely sheck it out.

There are one or two viruses that recognize Windows executables and do
special things to them (erase them, overlay them with Trojan code of
one kind or another, etc).  I know of no virus that can correctly
infect a Windows (or OS/2) executable in such a way that the virus
will be run when the program is run under Windows (OS/2); the
structure of these new-format EXE files is considerably more complex
than old-format DOS EXEs, and viruses generally either don't infect
them at all, break them while trying to infect them, or (rarely)
infect the "DOS fork" (the little program that runs and says "I don't
run in this environment" when you try to run one under flat DOS).  Not
that it would be impossible to write a virus that did it, of course;
we just haven't seen one yet.  The virus-writers will have to develop
some new technology...  *8) DC

I have disassembled and analysed a 643 byte Vienna variant I have
named Lydia.  This is NOT detected by any current virus scanners
correctly but is detected as a Vienna variant (or is usually detected
in some way). It is pretty harmless and poses very little threat. DONT
PANIC. Anyway here is my brief report..

                    A 643 byte variant of the Vienna virus

    Overview

               The Lydia virus was given to me as a 643 byte variant of the
    Vienna virus. The Vienna virus one of the first viruses that emerged and
    has many variants. Possibly due to the publication of the source code in a
    book and a magazine.

         After a little investigation I noticed that the virus scanners I had
    did not detect the virus correctly, at all, or only as a 'Possible variant
    of the Vienna' virus. So it was disassembled and analysed and this brief
    report was written.

    Name: Lydia
    Effective length: 643 bytes
    Infection Method: Parisitic Non-resident .COM infector
    McAfee Code: PNCK
    Discovered: Early 1992
    Symptoms: .COM file growth
    Scan string : A68B4475241F3C1F74EF817C79CEFA77

    General Details

         The virus is a 'direct action' virus in that it does not reside in
    memory and infects one other .COM file in the current directory when an
    already infected program is executed. If there are no other .COM files in
    the directory or they are already infected the virus will infect .COM files
    in the current path.

         The Lydia virus does not use a specific value (usually 62 with Vienna
    variants) in the seconds field of the files timestamp to detect infection.

         This Vienna variant also does not have a payload, it does not delete
    the host file or reboot the computer. It seems to have been written with no
    intentional damage in mind but some .COM programs crash when executed. The
    virus also does not check the size of the file it is infecting so if the
    addition of the virus causes the size of the .COM program to be greater
    than 64k an 'Out of memory' will occur, rendering the program
    un-executable.

        The are several text strings which appear in infected programs these
    are as shown below :

                       "Lydia 1.0 (C) 1992 by L'amore"
                               "ViRuS Lab USA"
                                   "*.SYS"
                                   "*.COM"
                                   "PATH="
                                "????????COM"

        The 'PATH=' string will immediately be followed by the name of the host
    program (in upper case characters), also the name of the host program (also
    in upper case charcters) will appear elsewhere. The name of the virus comes
    from the first text string. The '*.SYS' is not used by the virus and .SYS
    files are not infected. However, there seems to be some 'junk' in the code
    that would indicate that the virus was released unfinished or that this is
    a prototype or test version of a virus that hasn't been released.

        The code seems to have been written by someone who does not have a
    complete grasp of assembly language or at least of the architecture of the
    80x86 series of microprocessors, as some of the code is inefficient and
    could be optimized considerably to make the executable code shorter. I
    would imagine the virus is written by a 'beginner'.

        The virus poses no major threat as it can easily be detected and it
    does no intentional damage. The virus is not polymorphic or self-encrypting
    and does not use any stealth techniques. The most effective way to remove
    the virus is to replace infected files with clean copies.

Subject: Scanners and polymorphic viruses (PC)

Hello, everybody!

With the advent of the sophisticated polymorphic viruses like Dark
Avenger's Mutating Engine, it is becoming more and more obvious that
the scanners have really hard time to detect all infections. I have
already posted several times articles about how well (or, more
exactly, how bad) the different scanners detect the MtE-based viruses.
Several people have asked me why I am testing only MtE detection
capabilities, since none of the currently existing MtE-based viruses
is intelligent enough to spread widely and to be a significant danger.

I am doing this because the MtE is one of the most sophisticated tool
for building polymorphic viruses and presents a lot of trouble to the
producers of scanning software. Therefore, the inability to detect the
MtE-based viruses shows very well how limited the scanners are - the
MtE has been available since almost a year, yet only about a dozen
scanners achieve at least some success in detecting it. Of them about
the half are unable to detect it reliably.

However, the MtE-based viruses are not the only polymorphic viruses
which present problems to the scanners... I have tested several
scanners on a lot of examples of some of the most polymorphic viruses.
There is clear need to use a lot of examples, since some scanners are
able to detect only one or two instances of some polymorphic viruses -
the examples that the producer of the scanner has...

I used the following viruses during the tests:

Standard CARO name:	Number of different mutants generated:
- -------------------	--------------------------------------
Andryushka.A			46
Emmie				16
Haifa.Haifa			105
Haifa.Motzkin			101
Involuntary.A			8
Involuntary.B			89
Maltese_Amoeba			39
MtE_0_90.Dedicated		96
MtE_0_90.Pogue			98
MtE_0_90.Questo			101
MVF				96
Necros				115
PC-Flu_2			35
Silly_Willy			93
Simulate			29
Slovakia.2_02			81
Slovakia.3_00			57
StarShip			148
Tequila				68
Todor				101
V2Px.V2P1			35
V2Px.V2P2			8
V2Px.V2P6			27
V2Px.V2P6Z			61
WordSwap.1391			3
WordSwap.1495			10
Whale				164 (covering mutants #00 to #33)

The following scanners were used during the tests:

Scanner:	Version:	Producer:
- --------	--------	---------
FindVirus	4.34		S & S International
F-Prot		2.05		FRISK Software
VIRUSCAN	95		McAfee Associates
HTScan		1.8		Harry Thijssen
VirX		2.4		Microcom
AntiVir IV	4.04		H+BEDV
Anti-Virus+	4.20.01		IRIS
CPAV		1.0		Central Point Software

Some comments. You all know the first three products; I used the
latest versions available.

HTScan is a user-programmable scanner. It depends on a text file,
containing wildcard scan strings. Since most polymorphic viruses
cannot be detected this way (they need algorithmic approach), I
tested another feature of the scanner - the so-called AVR modules.
They are loadable at runtime small programs, which are executed by
the scanner and are supposed to perform algorithmic detection of
those polymorphic viruses, which cannot be detected with simple or
even with wildcard scan strings. In this particular version, there
are AVR modules for Maltese_Amoeba, MtE-based viruses, and the V2Px.*
series.

VirX I couldn't test. It does something incredibly stupid - tries to
keep the whole report file in memory. Of course, it soon runs out of
memory, so not record is kept about what viruses are detected and
which are not. I did only a partial test - on the MtE-based viruses
only.

We have only a very ancient version of CPAV, so the test results for
it are not up-to-date. That version tried to detect only V2Px.* and
Whale. Unsuccessfully, on the top of that...

Here are the results of the tests. Note that when I say that a scanner
reliably detects a virus, this holds only for these tests. It does not
mean that it will be able to detect all possible instances of the
virus; it just means that I have been unable to find an instance that
it does not detect. However, when I say that a scanner does not detect
a virus reliably, this means that it misses at least one example and I
have proven this.

FindVirus detected all infected files. However, this result is not
very fair towards the other scanners, since Dr. Solomon had access to
the infected samples, before submitting that version of the scanner.
This was not so with the other anti-virus producers.

F-Prot failed to detect at all Necros, Silly_Willy and Todor. It
failed to detect reliably Andryushka.A, Whale (mutant #32), and
V2Px.V2P6Z (only one example missed). It detected reliably all other
viruses.

VIRUSCAN does not detect at all Andryushka.A and StarShip. The latter
is rather strange, since I have submitted examples of this virus to
McAfee Associates months ago. The scanner does not detect reliably
MtE_0_90.Questo, MVF, Slovakia.2_02, Slovakia.3_00, V2Px.V2P6Z (only
one example missed) and Whale (mutant #33 missed). It also sometimes
misidentifies MtE_0_90.Pogue as 7thSon (when the virus is not
encrypted), but SCAN is proverbial with its lack of exact
identification. It succeeded to detect the other viruses reliably.

VirX tested on the MtE-based viruses only still does not recognize
those viruses reliably. It missed 12 of the total 292 examples.

AntiVir IV (a German anti-virus product) does not detect at all
Andryushka.A, Emmie, Haifa.Haifa, Haifa.Motzkin, Involuntary.A,
Involuntary.B, MVF, Necros, PC-Flu_2, StarShip and Todor. It failed to
identify correctly V2Px.V2P2 (one missed example) and Whale (several
mutants). The other viruses were detected reliably - even the
MtE-based one, with the exception that the non-encrypted files
infected with an MtE-based virus were reported to contain two viruses.

HTScan's AVR module for Maltese_Amoeba (IRISH.AVR) doesn't detect the
virus reliably. Surprisingly, the collection of wildcard scan strings
for the same virus, which is present in the text database, -does-
detect this virus reliably. So, my advice to the users of HTScan is to
delete the file IRISH.AVR and to rely on the database of signatures.
The module for Haifa.Haifa detected reliably all instances of the
virus, but didn't detect even one instance of the related virus
Haifa.Motzkin. The module which is supposed to detect MtE-based
viruses (its version is 2.3) failed to detect the non-encrypted
examples, infected with MtE_0_90.Pogue and MtE_0_90.Questo. The module
for the V2Px viruses (called "Washburn") detects reliably V2Px.V2P1,
but missed one instance of V2Px.V2P2, three instances of V2Px.V2P6 and
lots of instances of V2Px.V2P6Z. The Whale virus was detected reliably
by the collection of scan strings in the database.

Anti-Virus+ does not detect at all Andryushka.A, Emmie, MVF, Necros,
Silly_Willy, Necros, Slovakia.2_02, Slovakia.3_00, StarShip, Tequila,
Todor, WordSwap.1391 and WordSwap.1485. It did not detect reliably
Involuntary.A (in SYS files), MtE_0_90.Dedicated, MtE_0_90.Questo,
V2Px.V2P6, V2Px.V2P6Z and Whale (several mutants). The other viruses
were detected reliably.

The above tests clearly show that most of the current scanners are
still unable to cope with the existing polymorphic viruses. Even with
such well known viruses like V2P6 and MtE. At least one scanner was
unable to detect even Tequila! This virus is quite widespread and can
be detected with a few wildcard scan strings (3-4, I believe). And in
the near future we'll see more and more polymorphic viruses...

If some producer of scanning software thinks that his product is able
to show better results but I have missed to test it, s/he is welcome
to contact me and provide me a copy of their product (or tell me where
to get it, if it is available through anonymous ftp). I am ready to
test it and to publish the results, provided that:

1) The scanner is able to run without user intervention. I don't want
to be prompted to "press any key" each time a virus is found.

2) The scanner is able to produce a report file.

3) The scanner is able to output in the report file the names of all
files being scanned, not only those that it considers to be infected.

4) The scanner is requires a reasonable amount of memory. For
instance, Norton Anti-Virus 2.1 refused to run in about 400 Kb free
memory.

A description how to instruct the scanner to conform to the above
requirements (i.e., secret options, etc.) is welcome.

Subject: Problems with F-PROT (V2.05) (PC)

As a satisfied user of F-PROT I have to comment on a
couple of problems I have with the latest version.
 1) It no longer has the  "SCANNING MEMORY FOR VIRUSES" box
    come up at start-up time, though that is apparently what
    it is doing. Result is an span of several seconds where the
    menu appears ready for action but does not respond.
 2) VIRSTOP no longer hangs up the boot when it notices that
     it has been changed.  It still produces the warning message,
     with the recommendation to boot from a clean floppy, then
     allows the boot to continue.
 3) This might not be new to 2.05.  When you define some
     signature strings a file called USER.DEF is created.
     When you INSTALL F-PROT, USER.DEF is NOT one of the files
     copied over.

  Just my two cents, am I being too picky ?

HELP!!!!

I seem to have encountered a new virus, I don't know what it is or
where it came from.  I have run SCAN 95B on my hard disk, but it came
up with nothing.

Anyways, here's what is happening.  Every once in a while, my system
will try to access a file, only to find out that somehow, it has been
damaged!  This has happened to Windows 3.1 program manager groups,
Lotus 123 data files, etc.  I ran Norton's disk doctor, thinking I
might have something wrong with my HD.  Well, that deleted all my lost
clusters, and fixed all my cross-linked files.

Shortly thereafter, I ran into the same problem...  After much
investigation, I have found that the virus seems to only attack files
with their archive bit set, meaning they've been changed since the
last backup (a few days ago I put all 120 megs on tape).

Other than that, I really don't know much, except that I keep losing
things.

Please help, and thanx,

Cam Scholl.

Subject: scads of viri... (PC)

i'd been having hard drive problems for a while, a few bad sectors a
week would pop up, so i was on my way to getting a new drive anyway
... i run v-shield at startup and i ftp quite a bit, well last night
v-shield said it found A-VIR in memory, i powered down, booted from a
clean floppy and ran scan, which claimed to find a whopping 25
different viri. there appeared to be significant hard drive dammage to
a small portion of the drive.
	what i'm wondering is, could this be a false positive? i don't
see how i could have picked up such a high degree of virus infestation
that went unnoticed by v-shield.... i haven't tried rebooting the
machine since then, i figured i'd try and get a general consensis on
what to do from the powers that be first.

thanks.

Felix, are you a French speaking citizen?  I don't wish to be rude
about your English, so I shall just recommend that you compare
'common' and 'eradicated' in your dictionary.

On MTE:
    MTE is not a base but rather a wrapper.  It is used to make detection
    with scanning software more difficult.  It does not provide any 'magic'
    new functions for viruses.

In MS-DOS 4.0 it is normal to have this in Format.Com, I don't have a

Apart from the text in Config.Sys, why do you think there is a virus
involved?

The corruption of Config.Sys may be due to DOS mangling things, or
perhaps a 'friend' playing a prank?

If you still think you have a virus then you can try using F-PROT,
available from most FTP sites and BBSs that have SCAN.  Alternately
you could send an 'infected' file to some virus researchers for
detailed analysis.

Hope this helps,

There are rumours of Windows & OS/2 aware viruses, but none have reached
researchers - yet.

In the incidents reported to me, the affected individuals/companies have
always cleared it up themselves, and 'lost' the copies that they had put
aside.

I ran into the same problem scanning my Banyan networks with F-PROT
2.05.  I have not tested this theory out completely but I believe the
memory area for the scan report is filling up.  On the next write to
this memory some protected or program area is being overwritten and
the program hangs.  Version 2.04 must have had a bigger memory area
for the scan report.

I have not checked this out but you could try running F-PROT in
command mode try the /SILENT switch with the /REPORT=file switch to
get away from screen output.

Good Luck !!

I'll be glad to invest 20 hours/year in prevention as opposed to 20
hours of my time + the cost of 60 co-workers idled (or a manufacturing
line producing $500K/shift shut down) cleaning up after a hit.

I scan a total of about 2GB (about 12K files, I think) every workday
morning, using a 386/25; the files are distributed between five
NetWare servers w/SCSI drives running 3.11 and one running 2.15 w/ESDI
drives, all connected via thin Ethernet. This scan takes about 28
minutes using F-Prot 2.04a.

I think it's the best half hour of the day, when it comes up and says,
"Infected: 0". Besides, I've got two other workstations in my cubicle
that I can use while the scan is running.

More exactly, you should determine the file entry point (i.e., the
place where the initial JMP points to in COM files and the entry point
in the EXE files) and checksum a few bytes (30-40) from that point.
This is by no means secure (it can be trivially bypassed), but at
least will work against the currently existing viruses (supposing that
the virus is not stealth or is not active in memory). Just remembering
the file entry point is not sufficient - you have to checksum at least
a few bytes from that point. The reason is that there are several
viruses, which modify not the entry point, but the place where this
entry point points to. Such viruses are LeapFrog (for COM files),
Voronezh.1600 (for EXE files), and others.

Unfortunately, some of these programs are very widely used... Examples
include SideKick, Borland's integrated environments, McAfee's SCAN,
SETVER in DOS 5.0...
