    I've had contact with my friend, he could reproduce the problem...
The virus was found in COMMAND.COM of a MS-DOS 5.0 system.
COMMAND.COM has grown with 2601 bytes.  A 'grep' on COMMAND.COM didn't
find the string 'Ultimate', probably the message is encripted.  This
virus is of the 'stealth' type (original size of COMMAND.COM is shown
when a 'DIR' is done on the infected system).

    After I recovered from a (flu-)virus myself, I heard that our
local representative of McAfee Associates (CPU Communications) was
already notified about this virus (by someone else...).  They told
that the next version of SCAN will be able to recognize the new virus.
They even supplied the virus signature (MF00EVKUR). However I don't
know how to feed SCAN with this signature, SCAN expects a hexadecimal
string... maybe some of the readers can help me with that.

Subject: FixMBR and very large disks - potential problem (PC)

	I have identified the *possibility* for an adverse reaction
between FixMBR and disks having sector sizes larger than 512 bytes. I
have never seen one but believe that there are some in use, primarily
with very large older disks (over 300 Mb). FixMBR v2.4 corrects this
potential problem.

Theoretical Symptoms: Following FixMBR22 use, system will not boot from hard
                      disk but will from floppy. Use of MBR80 restores system
                      (see documentation). Alternate recovery would be to
                      use DOS 5.0 FDISK/MBR or FixMBR24.

	Again, I have never seen this happen nor have I ever received
a report of such but *think* it *might* be possible & cannot test.
Those most common disks used in PCs (MFM, RLL, IDE, SCSI) have
standard 512 byte sectors and are not affected. In any event, FixMBR
v2.4 *should* handle everything.

SBC is a resident infector of files that are executed, and COM, EXE,
and OVL files that are opened.  The first time an infected program is
run, it will try to infect the command interpreter (COMSPEC=, or
COMMAND.COM).  It infects both COM and EXE format files.  It is
"length-stealthed", in that if the virus is in memory the DIR command
will show the old, uninfected lengths.  It sets the seconds field of
infected files to 0x1F (==62), as usual.  It doesn't seem to have any
payload.  Since it infects files that are opened, scanning your system
with the virus in memory, using a scanner that doesn't know about the
virus, will tend to infect every file in your system...  DC

Not surprising since some versions of Zenith's operating system expect
the MBR code to follow the specifications. Most other OSes do not
expect help and will boot anyway.

Well, you booted off an uninfected floppy so the virus is not resident.
The CHKDSK test detects Mich when memory resident.

Well either copy sector 7 back to sector 1 or try FixMBR24 (will let
you do the same thing).

The basic rule is only file infecting viruses can propagate on a
network.  This includes the file infecting characteristics of
multi-partite viruses.  Because of NetWare's redirection of BIOS and
DOS interrupts, normal BSI viruses cannot infect a NetWare file server
from a workstation.  Linking viruses also cannot propagate using
NetWare as there is no DOS directory entry to modify.

                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
There is a clear distinction between NetWare RIGHTS and ATTRIBUTES.
ATTRIBUTES are an emulation and an extension of regular DOS file
attributes.  All DOS attributes (or NetWare ATTRIBUTES which exactly
emulate DOS attributes) can be changed by viruses.  Viruses can
therefor bypass certain Netware attributes.  There are only two
NetWare ATTRIBUTES which prohibit viral infection, they are EXECUTE
ONLY and surprisingly, SYSTEM.  The SYSTEM NetWare ATTRIBUTE does not
perfectly emulate the DOS system attribute, and does not permit viral
infection.  The 1701 virus used in your test CANNOT infect a file
protected by the NetWare SYSTEM ATTRIBUTE but it will zip right past a
DOS system attribute.

RIGHTS are NetWare's own security implementation and provide
substantial protection against viruses.  Viruses cannot directly alter
assigned effective RIGHTS.  However, assigned RIGHTS can be overridden
through the use of the SUPERVISORY RIGHT.  The SUPERVISORY right
supersedes any restrictions placed on subdirectories or files with an
inherited rights mask.

 >While successful at infecting C:\TESTEXEC files, repeated efforts

There are some viruses, such as 4096, which do very well on
stand-alone systems, but can't properly infect files stored on a
NetWare shared volume.  In fact, attempting to copy a 4096 infected
file from an infected workstation to a NetWare volume will disinfect
the file.  This is because of the stealth actives of 4096 and
NetWare's redirection of interrupts.  The 4096 uses single-stepping to
determine the original interrupt 21h and place its code.  Since
NetWare redirects this type of call, 4096 is unable to infect files
stored on the server.

I hope this helps.

 My brother was installing an expanded memory manager he had
legitamately purchased and found what he thought was a virus.  Upon
rebooting the system, the following message flashed across the screen:

Look out!  Buy direct from Bob and Steve!

He took the disk in and scanned it using McAffee's SCAN, but nothing
turned up.  Is this a virus, or maybe just an extra tossed in by the
software designers?

L.S.,
Today, 23 january 1992 we found one (1) PC infected with the flip-
virus [Flip]. It was reported by McAfee's VSHIELD v77 being resident
at that PC after boot-up.

First booted from a clean MS-DOS 3.30 system disk.
Scan with McAfee's SCANv85 resulted in three infected 'files'.
1. a general partitiontable infection [GenP]
2. VSHIELD.EXE, externally infected LZEXE compressed file [Flip]
3. COMMAND.COM [Flip]

We were able to remove the infections in two passes, the first one
for the [GenP], the second for both [Flip]. Thank you, McAfee!

The Infected PC is one out of 16 in a public student facility, all
being a workstation in a Novell Netware 3.11 network. The route of
infection is unknown, but we think the infection took place through
running infected .EXE file(s) from a user's floppy disk. No other
PC's were infected so far, but as long as the infected floppy
circulates, there is a potential for re-infection (alas...).

The Erasmus University Rotterdam is a legal user of McAfee's
SCAN/CLEAN/VSHIELD through a negociated licence mediated by the dutch
SURFnet organization in Utrecht, the Netherlands.

Sincerely,

Sorry, that's not accurate.  F-Shield (now called File Protector and
no longer associated with McAfee) does indeed add a self-disinfecting
envelope to other programs, but Untouchable certainly does not.  It
keeps all the disinfectant info in a central database. (It does check-
sum itself before checking other files and warns you if it has been
modified, but it does not *disinfect* itself on the fly as described
in your quote from Frisk.)

comment on.  BTW, I've gotten a number of suggestions on how/when I
should distribute the FAQ - thanks to all.  Comments and suggestions
are welcomed.]

   I would like to present you a special case where I would say,
   this is one, and I'm very interested in your opinion.

   Some week ago, someone uploaded a program in a BBS where
   anonymous uploading is possible. The program description given
   had some attributes that were sufficient to make the program a
   widely downloaded one. Keywords were: "sex","porno" et cetera...
   To admit, the author did all not to say what the program really
   was for.

   What the program did: It asked the user to free 20MB of hard
   disk space (if not already free), created a file with that length
   fully filled with "6"es and stuffed it on the screen. This should
   apparently be a joke since in German the words for "sex" and for
   the number 6 are spoken the same way. So the program actually
   intended no damage, but some users with small hard disks had
   problems with Murphy's law when freeing the space (they deleted
   files, you know).

   The story still is not ended because the program writer later
   claimed it to be a "scientific experiment"...

   So, is this a trojan or not? Where is the border between "damaging"
   and "not damaging"? Is it sufficient for a program to be a trojan
   if it does not what it says or intends?

I would say not.  It didn't masquerade as another program or hide
itself as part of another program.

Damaging or not is not part of the definition.  I would label it a
stupid immature prank, shun the author and forget about it.

And BTW, anyone who would download an untested program and follow
"suspect" instructions like that based on keywords like "sex" and
"porno" is just asking for trouble.  Some might suggest that these
people got what they deserved.

NIST has decided not to take an active role in the PC community (at
least that was how I interpreted Dennis's talk at the NCSA luncheon),
there is a definate vaccuum.

Correction. The published "shortest virus" is in fact the shortest
(they believe) non-overwriting non-resident COM-file infector for
MS-DOS. It is 109 bytes, not 110. It was published in both source and
hex dump. The hex dump has obviously been entered by hand from an
assembly listing of the source, and by an unexperienced person, on the
top of that, that's why it is extremely buggy and will not work. The
source works perfectly, however, if assembled.

The shortest virus in the same class (Prof. Brunnstein is wrong here -
it is non-resident) is indeed Bulgarian and is indeed 94 bytes only.
However, it contains an undocumented instruction (POP CS), which works
only on 8086/8088 processors (not above).

I didn't read this book, but I remember seeing reviews and looking at
it in a bookstore.  The inane, implausible plot was that the US
allowed the USSR to smuggle a Cray-something into their country, and
that as soon as a particular weather condition came up in the weather
program (that all Crays run all the the time, of course, even ones
doing codebreaking in the Soviet Union), it started taking over all of
the other computers in the country.  Interoperability at its finest.
What I found especially laughable in the promotions for the book was
that one of the authors was described as some sort of incredible
computer genius, thus enhancing the plausibility of the book's
scenario.  I suspect that the guy had a C64 that he used to play video
games, given the deep technical understanding that the book appeared
to show...

According to Swans technical support the BIOS are upgraded by

I agree that because of proprietary differences, and the fact that
most machines today do not have Flash EPROM BIOS, BIOS modifying
viruses will not become a significant issue.  Although I have no doubt
that someone will probably try, "just for the fun of it." :(

Subject: Re: New Antivirus Organization Announced

Here is a description of the Antivirus Methods Congress, direct from
Dick Lefkon himself (along with a paragraph about who Dick is):

Dick Lefkon (dklefkon@well.sf.ca.us) is 1991-1992 President of
Antivirus Methods Congress.  His term of office ends spring 1992.  He
is program chair of the FIFTH INTERNATIONAL COMPUTER VIRUS & SECURITY
CONFERENCE to be held March 11-13 at the Loews Summit and Marriott in
New York.  Dick was asked to do the setup work for AMC in 1991 since
he had helped to start five of the eight SIGs at Data Processing
Management Association.  Of four clearance levels (researcher, vendor,
user practitioner, lay user), Dick ranks himself as a user
practitioner.
 
AMC was established to unite all constituencies in the struggle to
slow and eventually overcome the onslaught of malevolent code.
Specific committees for University Users, Corporate Users, Government
Users, Vendors, Telecom Users, and Non-DOS users have directly elected
chairs and make sure their constituencies receive proper liaison and
are not inadvertently ignored by the joint effort.  AMC does not
endorse any product or course.
 
Action Committees of AMC include Identification/Classification, Legal,
Credentials (includes clearance for virus swapping), Nonproliferation
(protections in swapping), Research Methods and possible others.  AMC
acts as a "frontend" for existing centers and efforts, a single
well-known referral point that the uninitiated user can contact with a
need and be sent directly to one or more existing parties.  AMC
"harmonizes" with other ongoing efforts and does not attempt to
supplant any.  No dues until spring vote, then $5 or $10 US
thereafter.  Quarterly or monthly thin newsletter (no scholarly
journal), with most productive committee work done via existing e-mail
and donated forum space.
 
Membership by sending name, address, e-mail and phone and saying
you hereby declare yourself a member.  Name your classification
if it's clear to you.

Subject: F-PROT 2.02 now available (PC)

Version 2.02 of F-prot is now available on SIMTEL20, and should be
available on beach.gal.utexas.edu in a day or two....

- -frisk

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.02 - corrections:

  "Secure Scan" used to report a "possible new variant of Yaunch" when
  scanning certain files, including some OS/2 executables - fixed.

  On certain old types of 360K floppy disk drives the scanner would not
  always detect a disk change - it would scan the boot sector correctly,
  but not the files contained on the diskette - fixed.

  "Analyse Program" would occasionally crash with a "Divide error"
  message - fixed.

  Version 2.01 had some problems when scanning Bernoulli boxes, and
  when run from the OS/2 DOS box - fixed.

Version 2.02 - improvements:

  "Secure Scan" is now several times as fast as previously, and it is now
  the default method.  "Full Scan" no longer exists.

  "Secure Scan" can now usually determine if data has been appended to a
  file after infection.

  "Secure Scan" can now also usually determine if a file has been
  infected by two different viruses, and should be able to remove them
  in the correct order.

  Memory scan is now much faster than previously, but can no longer be
  aborted by pressing ESC.

  As the first .SYS-infecting files have now been found "in the wild"
  outside Bulgaria, the set of default file extensions has been expanded
  to include "SYS" as well.

  It is now possible to scan for any combination of boot/file viruses,
  Trojans and user-defined patterns at the same time - previously a
  separate scan was required to search for user-defined patterns.

  The scanning report now includes a date/time stamp, as well as a
  description of the parameters used.

  The following command-line switches have been added.

      /ANALYSE      Uses heuristic analysis instead of signature-based
                    virus scanning.
      /HARD         Scan all DOS partitions on the hard disk.
      /MULTI        Scan multiple diskettes.
      /NET          Scan all network "drives".
      /REPORT=file  Saves the output to "file".
      /SILENT       Generates no screen output.

   "Analysis" no longer exists as a separate function in the main menu,
   but only as the third search method, in addition to Secure Scan and
   Quick Scan.

   The VIRSTOP.BIN file no longer exists.

   F-PROT.EXE now returns an exit code, which can be checked with an
   ERRORLEVEL command.  See COMMAND.DOC for further information.
