Yes, it's a false positive.

In general: the heuristic analysers (F-Prot's analyser,
CHECKOUT/BOOTID) are woderful tools for the anti-virus researchers
(Mark, I'm still waiting for a version of your tools which can work on
files), but they MUST NOT be used by the average users in their dayly
scan procedures. I hereby refuse to give any explanation of the
problem. You just must not use this mode, unless you perfectly know
what it does. Otherwise we (the anti-virus researchers) will be
flooded with questions and "suspicious" programs that caused a
heuristic false positive. I sincerely believe that Frisk will remove
this feauture in the next versions of his program and will make it
available as a separate tool to the research community.

It is both overdone (you don't need to shut down everything for just
scanning the uploaded files) and underdone (just scanning can catch
only known viruses).

Yes. For known viruses only. But your method won't catch a new virus
either.

No way. The virus code must be executed in order to infect your
system.

Another coincidence is that EDV is the German equivalent of EDP
(Electronic Data Processing). The EDV virus is French, however.

The next time (March 6, 1993), they probably won't. Since the virus
continues to spread, this will cause much more hard disks to be wiped
out than this year. That's why March 6, 1994 will be a good "next
time"... :-)

Yeah, it mutates damn well... And -is- powerful. But there is no such
thing made by a man, that cannot be broken by another.

A lot of viruses already do that. They are called polymorohic. The
problem with the MtE is that it mutates -too- well... :-(

Not impossible. Just damn hard. Currently there are three viruses,
produced with the MtE 0.90-beta. SCAN 86-B is able to detect one of
them (Pogue) in most cases (but still misses some). Dr. Solomon's
Anti-Virus ToolKit is able to detect any virus, made with the MtE in
most cases (but still misses some). The people who produced The
Untouchable (BRM from Israel; they are -not- the company that markets
the product) claim that they are able to detect -any- virus made with
the MtE in -all- cases. They have promissed to provide a freeware
detector for these viruses.

If it was THE virus, it wouldn't be such a problem... It is a problem,
because it's a -toolkit- for building very highly mutating polymorphic
viruses. So that just any kid (well, almost) can get it and produce
his own polymorphic virus. And this is -much- more dangerous...

Yeah, as I have noted several times, Scan is only reliable in telling
whether an object is infected or not. It's pretty good on that.
Anything else (the exact name of the virus, it's properties, to which
viruses it is related) is often wrong.

Yep, John has "optimized" his signatures... :-)

You should be able to circumvent this by telling it to scan only the
current directory of the drive (and downwards), like in

	f-prot z:. /trojan /noboot

The general idea makes sense, indeed. Especially if improved as you
are suggesting. I only didn't like that the program (as far as I
understood) "corrects" the boot sector if it thinks it's wrong. This
must be done only when the user explicitely requests it, and the
original contents of the corrected boot sector must be saved in a
file. I hate the "I know better what programs you must be running"
approach.

Good guess... But totally wrong. :-) On my XT the INT 13h handler for
the hard disk is on the hard disk controllers's EPROM and is at
address 0C800:0000h.

Are you serious is proposing the average user to perform the above
operation, in order to install the anti-virus program? The same user
who can't make the difference between a boot sector and a partition
table and between a virus and a spreadsheet?

This sounds much better. Another idea is to trace INT 13h (like some
viruses do). A program that does this, called ShrDog, can be found at
our ftp site (ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de, IP=134.100.4.42,
pub/virus/progs/shrdog.zip). Warning - it doesn't seem to work with DR
DOS 6.0.

Well, Ross, I guess you didn't expect that a user will use your
program in this way... :-) Will have to make the Ctrl-Break handler
clean up the memory...

Strange, Scan is supposed to never decrypt its scan strings... It
should encrypt the scanned data instead... At least it was this way
the last time I looked at it...

Nobody knows for sure, since both John McAfee and Ross Greenberg do
not disclose the scan strings that they are using. But, since you
claim to have found the signatures in the memory dumps, you should be
able to compare them and see which are the same...

Because it's intelligent enough to encrypt it.

Intelligent scanners - yes. Silly scanners (like CPAV) - no. That's
why they (the silly ones) cause false positives. The even more
intelligent antivirus programs don't scan the file for the signatures;
they look for them only at the places where they should be.

The intelligent scanners are supposed to do so.

Oh, yes, there is one. Consider a virus which randomly overwrites
sectors of the hard disk (e.g., Dark_Avenger.1800.Standard). Suppose
that it does the dammage before the Stacker's device driver is loaded
(or alternatively, does the damage to the drive, on which the large
stacked file can be seen). Overwriting just ONE sector of the file,
which contains the stacked volume, will damage the whole volume - just
like damaging a few bytes in the middle of a ZIP archive damages the
whole archive.

Fortunately, Stacker comes with a wonderful utility, called SCHECK,
which is able to repair the damage, or at least to minimize it. It is
something like CHKDSK and PKZIPFIX combined. I'm not aware of the
existence of such tool for SuperStor (the Stacker's alternative, which
comes with DR DOS 6.0).

The above said, I personally love Stacker and am using it without any
problems.

Nope, they don't. I have written a program, which does exactly that

The virus triggers some time after the initial infection has taken
place. After four months, I believe... The effect is displaying a
crude fractal image, written in text mode with the pseudographic

Subject: Brush with No-Int (PC)

Hi gang,

After  being SO pleased that my university only had 36 reported cases of
Michelango and my college (which has networks into all 120 counties) had
NO  reports  of  Michelango, I did  a  dumb thing!  I made drive "A" the
current  drive  with  an UNSCANNED floppy in it.   I quickly realized my
error  and  ran  SCAN  on  the  diskette: with it still in the "current"
drive. Sure enough, it  was  infected (with "No-Int").   (We have a grad
lab which is chronically  infected  with  stoned - clean it every week!)
While  still logged on drive "A" I  tried  to  clean  the  diskette  and
got  a " ... EXE file error..." or something like that  and  got  dumped
back to the prompt.  When I realized what I  had  done,  I  removed  the
diskette and cleaned  it  on  another  computer.   I logged the original
one back to  the "C" drive  but  still couldn't activate CLEAN.  Further
checking uncovered a zero length  CLEAN.EXE  in the root directory.  I'm
99.44% sure it  wasn't  there  before  this happened.  I cold booted the
machine from a clean,  write protected floppy and scanned it.  The  hard
drive  was not  infected,  so  the virus never got control.

Did the virus make that zero byte entry???  Is logging to a  drive  with
an infected diskette in it enough to activate a virus???  Any thoughts??

Oh, don't worry... :-) He has "cracked" a -very- ancient version of
SCAN. Since then, McAfee Associates have changed several times (1)
some of the virus signatures they are using, (2) the encryption
method, and (3) the encryption strategy.

What really bothers me is that he succeeded to post on a moderated

Well, a lot more can be done. Like better detecting unknown variants
of known viruses (F-Prot), better reporting related viruses (F-Prot),
exact virus identification (Dr. Solomon's AVTK), more flexible
wildcards (HTScan/TbScan), etc...

Yeah, now. But he has cracked a version of Scan (64, if memory
serves), which is from the stoned age - more than a year ago... :-)

(Alternative Subject: Michelangelo, foolishes and backup tapes)

  As an example of the Michelangelo hysteria, here is the translation of
a piece of news appeared on March 5 in several Spanish newspapers, but
perpetrated by a local news agency (bracket-enclosed laughters are mine).

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

              The attack virus 'Michelangelo' took place earlier and
                     destroyed Uruguayan army Files

        It can affect seventy millions computers all over the world

EFE [Local News Agency] LONDON.
 The computer virus 'Michelangelo', considered as one of the most destructive,
may become active between today and tomorrow Friday in infected computers.
According to Scotland Yard [:-)], a temporal solution [:-)] to avoid
Michelangelo becoming active is program [:-)] the clock of the computer
to March 7th, to jump the dates 5 and 6 when the virus can become active.
 Another possibility  is not to use the computers during the day 6 [:-)].
Michelangelo acts deleting all the data stored in the memory [:-):-):-):-)]
of the computer.
 Previously to Friday the sixth, Uruguay was a victim of the virus as a week
ago [??] some files from the Army and from the Electricity National Company
were destroyed. It is considered most likely that the virus came to Uruguay
from Buenos Aires, by electronic mail [:-):-):-):-):-)] or data transmission
network [:-):-):-):-):-)... also by telephone, fax and smoke signals]. The
Army has lost all its documents of intelligence and spying [:-) meaning
happiness].

      The victims
 Sixty million [:-):-):-):-)] computers all over the world will be victims
of Michelangelo on 6 March, which will wake up to relentlessly destroy all
data stored in their memories [:-)]. Experts [:-):-):-):-)] from the main
multinational companies [The main multinational companies have virus experts?
I think that they only spread viruses] agreed that this is a especially [:-)]
perverse virus, that will stand out in the history of computer terrorism.
  The experts [:-):-):-):-):-):-)] estimated that between 55 and 65 millions
[:-):-):-):-):-):-):-)] personal computers worldwide have the tramp in their
entrails in latent state, waiting for the clock to strike the sixth of March.
In this way, Michelangelo, thus christianed because it will attack on the 517
anniversary of the genial Italian artist, has spread all over the world since
it was discovered in Holland ten months ago. This virus enters clandestinely
[:-) I have heard about some who first ask permission] in the computer and
infects any program [:-):-):-):-)], that when used allows the virus to move
to the hard disk [where was the program, to start with?].

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Moral: Since newspapers do not have virus experts, they ask for information
to the main multinational companies... who don't have either.

 I wish to thank the help in the translation (and some wicked remarks) of
Eduardo Sainz de la Maza, Julian Aguirre and J.J. Merelo.

While I agree that the first viruses and anti-virus programs (the
- -very- first ones!) are of American origin, your statements need some
corrections.

Wrong. The first Bulgarian virus (Old Yankee) was written in November
1988 (I personally know the person who wrote it). At that time there
were very few IBM PC viruses - Brain, Lehigh, Jerusalem (with the
Suriv variants), Cascade, Vienna, Ping Pong. Maybe a couple more.

> and 90% of them were written by US hackers.

Wrong. Of the above, only Lehigh is of American origin.

> Bulgaria added not more than 20 new viruses for them.

About 180, if you count all the variants (as you seem to do below).
This is 15 %. A bit too much for a single country, I have to admit,
but certainly not "most of the viruses", as some journalists seem to
claim...

> Just now antiviral researches report about more than 1000

They are about 1200 right now... And I haven't merged the new ones
that I just received; they are probably about 50 new ones...

> Wait some years and we can get reports about viruses from Africa.

No need to wait. We already have them. Republic of South Africa has
produced several (extremely silly) viruses.

Right. The mistake of the original poster is caused probably by the
fact that the first anti-virus program, which became known world-wide
is the Israeli program UnVirus (used to disinfect the Jerusalem
virus).

Try oak.oakland.edu, directory pub/msdos/trojan-pro. However, most
people don't provide the source code for their anti-virus programs.
And why are you interested mainly in monitoring programs? This is the
weakest line of defense against the computer viruses...

Yep; there are several such devices. Their functions range from a
simple write-protect switch for the hard disk, to sophisticated
monitoring functions. One good device of this kind is the ThunderByte
card. Unfortunately, it is usually possible to bypass -any- such
protection. It is true, however, that it is not easy, and such cards
(if well designed) are able to stop almost all of the current viruses,
which to not target the cards speciffically.

Available at oak.oakland.edu, file pub/msdos/trojan-pro/vsumx202.zip.

Well, you are wrong. The file attributes used by Novell are an
emulation of the DOS attributes and can be bypassed just as easily,
but the file access rights CANNOT be bypassed.

The stealth viruses are nothing special. You just need to scan the
memory first. If they are not found to be active, you can scan the
files as with any other normal virus. The really tricky ones are the
polymorphic viruses...

Maybe you should begin with looking at an already available and pretty
good user-programmable shareware virus scanner? Take a look at HTSCAN16.ZIP
(at Simtel20, same directory).
