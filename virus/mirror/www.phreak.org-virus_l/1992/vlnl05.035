VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  (The complete set of posting guidelines is available by
FTP on cert.sei.cmu.edu or upon request.)  Please sign submissions
with your real name.  Send contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU
(that's equivalent to VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).
Information on accessing anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue

In fact, the floppy already becomes non-bootable as soon as it gets
infected by both viruses, not as a result of the disinfection...

If you are comparing only those three programs, McAfee is a winner. It
is small, easy to use, and has much, much higher virus detection rate
than the other two packages. I have not seen NAV 2.0, but CPAV and NAV
1.5 are pretty useless as virus scanners. They are big dinosaurs with
low virus detection rate.

However, please have in mind that McAfee is trying to optimise the
virus detection. This means that they are trying to detect as many
viruses with as few scan strings as possible. This is a perfectly
valid approach, since it provides a relatively high detection rate and
good speed. However, the only thing you should believe SCAN is whether
an object (disk or file) is infected or not. For most users this is
sufficient. Anything else that SCAN reports (the name of the virus,
its properties, to which viruses it is related, etc.) is quite
unreliable.

You can also consider some other virus scanning packages, like F-Prot
and Dr. Solomon's Anti-Virus ToolKit, which are superior to SCAN,
IMHO.

Also, have in mind that just scanning for known viruses is a quite
unreliable method for virus protection, since new viruses appear very
quickly (I got about 110 only for January). You should consider adding
an additional level of protection, like checksumming.

If you decide to consider checksumming products, probably the
Untouchable is the currently most secure one. However, have in mind
that its other capabilities (scanning and disinfection) are quite
miserable... And, at last, if you want a shareware checksummer (which
is not as secure as the commercial one, however), take a look at the
Integrity Master.

Hallo,

I am new to this list.  Forgive me if I'm asking a stupid thing.  I
tried to find in the archives of VIRUS-L something about the

Regarding the origins of the Michelangelo virus we first came up against
this virus in April 1991 when we purchased a PC from a particular vendor.
Our subsequent investigations revealed the source of the infection to be
a beta version of DOS 5.0. Subsequently several other people in the
university purchased PCs from this dealer with the virus.
As the first reports of this virus are credited to some European
countries in the same month I feel that the virus was probably around
earlier than this but was not yet recognised as a new virus  as it seems
unlikely that it could have travelled that quickly from Europe to a
insignificant PC dealer in Perth, Australia.

Cinderella infects every file opened or executed. This explains why
you got so many infected file - each time you have accessed them for
any reason (e.g., for scanning) they got infected...

Yep, CLEAN is not a very good disinfector, but disinfecting files is a
bad idea in the first place...

This means that the virus has been active in memory and it infected
the file as soon as the scanner accessed it. That's why you must
always boot from a non-infected write-protected system diskette, prior
to try to scan or disinfect a system...

This is fishy... Cinderella is only 390 bytes long and it certainly
cannot cause a 1 Kb increase...

Nope. Nothing can survive a warm reboot. I mean nothing can -really-
survive a -real- warm reboot on all machines. Cinderella even doesn't
try to.

Wrong. VShield does not try to pick up any attempt to infect a file.
What it does is to prevent the execution of an already infected file.
However, if the virus is already active and the file not infected,
then VShield will allow the file to be executed (since it is not
infected) and the virus will infect it (since it infects any file
being executed).

:-) Yeah, when you turned the machine off, the virus was removed from
memory.

There are other interesting questions though.

1) Why SCAN's memory check was not able to detect the the virus is
present in memory?

2) If VShield has been installed on a intially clean system, why
didn't prevent the system to become infected (i.e., why didn't it
denied the execution of the first infected file)?

Anybody from McAfee Associates willing to explain this?

A computer virus is a program, which can infect other programs by a

Note that the above does not mean that all the people who called were
infected. Most of them just need information, after having heard about
the virus in the media. Our Virus Test Center got more than 5,000
phone calls related to this virus for the last two weeks. Only very
few people were actually infected. But Aryeh is right that the threat
is real. Maybe just not as big as the media suggests...

Such things will happen more often in the future... It is even
possible that companies get deliberately attacked by their competitors
who release the rumor that the aprticular company has spread a
virus... Such a rumor is very hard to disprove and a company can lost
a lot of money because of it...

IBM PC - yes. MS-DOS-compatible - not necessarily. The computer can
have only a Unix (Xenix, Aix, etc.) partition and become infected
nevertheless. It won't be able to spread the infection further (or
even to boot Unix for that matter), but its disk will be overwritten,
if you try to boot from it on March 6. It's enough if the computer is
IBM PC-compatible.

Can the respective producers of the above programs confirm that? I
have the impression that such early versions of SCAN and F-PROT do not
detect this virus, but I might be wrong.

This is pure nonsense. The Maltese Amoeba virus activates on March 15.
Have we not to work on this date as well? And what about the viruses
that are active and destroy data every day, every hour? Does it mean
that we must not turn our computers on at all?! No, people must obtain
good virus protection tools and practice safe computing.

Besides, I really cannot understand why people get so excited about a
silly virus that happens to wake up once per year and to destroy the
information on your hard disk at once. Suppose one morning you come to
the office, turn your computer on, and puff! all the information on
the hard disk is gone. So what? You just reformat the disk and
re-install everything from your backups. You have spent at most one
day doing this, and at most one day of your work is lost (if you have
a good backup scheme). Nothing disastrous.

There are much more devious viruses, like Phoenix and Nomenklatura.
They spread every day, every hour, every minute. The corrupt
information every day. But they corrupt it -slightly-. So, when you
finally notice that something has gone wrong, you can no more rely on
your backups - since you don't know when the infection occured, and
which files are corrupted...

Not any diskettes. Only those in drive A:.

Sorry, wrong assumption. It is true, of course, for Michelangelo, but
it is perfectly possible to design a virus which will install itself
in memory and will not be overwritten by DOS, without changing
anything at 0000:0413h. Even better (worse?) - such viruses already
exist. So, don't rely on this method.

This is not exact. The virus does not destroy intentionally anything.
However, due to the way it replicates, it may trash the first FAT copy
on -some- (quite rare) hard disks formatted with customary DOS
versions. Also, it can overwrite part of the root directory on
high-capacity diskettes. Note that this damage occurs as soon as the

This is nonsense. No virus can infect anything if it is only read. You
must execute it, in order to make it spread. However, if the virus is
- -already- active in memory, just reading a diskette can (and in this
case will) infect it (the diskette).

Not -this- virus, sorry. It's a boot/master boot sector infector and

Of course, it is possible to make a special trojan horse, which, when
executed releases the virus. Then the file, containg the trojan will
be transferable by modem lines. But this is not "catching as infection
by downloading a file".

An even better idea is not to rely on scanning at all, since it does
not catch unknown viruses, and even no scanner can catch -all- of the
currently existing viruses. Nowdays the viruses are just created
faster than the scanners are updated... :-( A better idea is to use
also alternative anti-virus techniques (e.g., checksumming, etc.).

Yes. Definitevely. Stoned will damage any diskette with weird format,
including non-MS-DOS formats, 800 Kb 5.25" diskettes, etc. This will
be done not intentionally but because of the ignorance of the virus
author.

What actually happens is that Stoned overwrites the boot sector of the
diskette with its own body. Therefore it overwrites any provious
information about the particular diskette format stored there.
Furthermore, the virus writes the original contents of the boot sector
to what it believes to be the last sector of the root directory. But
in your friend's case the backup disks didn't have any root directory!
They weren't MS-DOS formatted at all. So probably the virus overwrote
part of the data being backed up. So, no wonder that it was not
possible to restore from such a diskette.

My advice is to always verify the backups before formatting the hard
disk.

as time of latest update.

Same symptoms with other DOS devices.

I think, this answers the question posted in VIRUS-L, about a fortnight
ago.

   In this article I'm going to describe the method for computer virus

   Bezrukov, from Kiev, Ukraine.

   His computer virus notation belongs to the type of so-called behaviouristic
   notations - each virus is assigned a special code, which describes its
   behaviour. Similar viruses have similar descriptions. The descriptions are
   not unique, therefore two very similar and closely related virus variants
   may have the same descriptions.

   I personally dislike this kind of methods, since it has several drawbacks:

   1) The descriptions are not strictly unique and therefore cannot be used
   for exact virus identification.

   3) The descriptions include only a limited number of virus properties.
   Therefore, then a new idea in the virus writing appears, and a virus with a
   completely new property is created (e.g., the Dir II virus), the
   description method must be changed accordingly.

It does have the advantage of not feeding the ego of the virus
writers.  Using the names given by the virus writers for
identification and discussion just has to stroke the vanities of the
writers of these viruses.

This should probably go to the FAQ list... Anyway:

[Moderator's note: It just did go to the FAQ list, thanks!]

There are three major sources of information about viruses. Probably
the biggest one is Patrica Hoffman's hypertext VSUM. It describes only
MS-DOS viruses, but almost all of them. Unfortunately, it tends to be
too verbose and is -very- inaccurate, so I do not advise people to
rely on it. It can be downloaded from most major archive sites
- -except- Simtel20 and its mirrors.

The second one is the Computer Virus Catalog, published by the Virus
Test Center Hamburg (plug). It contains a highly technical description
of computer viruses for several platforms - MS-DOS, Mac, Amiga, Atari
ST, Unix. Unfortunately, the MS-DOS section is -very- incomplete -
less than 10 % of the known MS-DOS viruses are listed there. The CVC
is available for anonymous ftp from ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de
(IP=134.100.4.42), directory pub/virus/texts/catalog.

The third source of information is Virus Bulletin. It regularly
publishes very detailed technical information about viruses.
Unfortunately it is -very- expensive (the subscription is about $350
per year).

Another source of information is the documentation of Dr. Solomon's
Anti-Virus ToolKit. It is more complete than the CVC, just as accurate
(if not more), but lists only MS-DOS viruses. However, it is not
available electronically; you must buy his anti-virus package and the
virus information is part of the documentation.

Hope the above helps.

Vesselin

Subject: Michelangelo virus story in The Washington Post

Major computer virus story in The Washington Post newspaper.
Washington, D.C. USA.  Monday, Feb. 17, 1992.  pages A1,A24,A25.

It seems to me that this story is generally accurate (for the public
press) and useful to publicize the computer virus issue to the general
public.  Located on the front page of one of the nations' major
newspapers is indicative of some trend, but, I'm not sure what.

=======================================================================
Page A1.  'MICHELANGELO' SCARE STIRS FEARS ABOUT COMPUTER VIRUSES.
By John Burgess, Washington Post Staff Writer.

   A new and unusually destructive type of computer "virus" -- a
software program that enters a computer surreptitiously and destroys
data there en masse -- has reignited concern over these electronic
saboteurs.
   Security experts have dubbed the virus "Michelangelo," because after
entering a computer it lies dormant until March 6, the Italian
Renaissance artist's birthday.  Then it springs to life and wipes out
data stored on the computer's memory disk.
   In November, a copy of Michelangelo turned up at the Gaithersburg
offices of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, hiding on
the data disk of a computer that had been returned after being on loan
to another federal agency.
   Using special software, institute technicians found the virus and
removed it after receiving a tip from the other agency.  That agency had
found the virus on its computers and warned the institute to make sure
its computer hadn't been infected too.
   Michelangelo got national attention last month after Leading Edge
Products Inc., a manufacturer of personal computers compatible with
those of International Business Machines Corp., confirmed that it had
shipped about 500 machines that contained the virus.  The manufacturer
sent customers special software designed to neutralize it.
   Because the triggering date lies in the future, no one is known to
have lost data due to the virus, which was created by an unknown
programmer and has spread from computer to computer through the exchange
of infected floppy disks.
   But security experts, using special software that scans computer
disks to detect viruses, have been finding  [end of story on page A1]

Page A24.   DESTRUCTIVE NEW COMPUTER VIRUS FOUND
copies of Michelangelo since last summer and removing them before they
activate.
   It remains unclear whether large numbers of computers contain
undetected copies of the virus, though estimates of millions of machines
have been published in the news media.  Michelangelo affects only
IBM-compatible personal computers, but there are about 60 million of
these in existence.
   Past scares about viruses often have proven to be overblown.  But due
to Michelangelo's unusually destructive nature, as well as the potential
presence of other viruses, some computer experts are suggesting that
personal computer users take no chances over getting caught by a virus.
   "When it hits, it's dramatic," said Lance Hoffman, a professor of
computer science at George Washington University.
   Computer users can protect themselves by making additional electronic
copies of information they cannot afford to lose, by reducing the
exchange of floppy disks and the transmission of software over phone
lines, and by obtaining special software that detects viruses.
   Viruses are a surprise byproduct of the computer age.  Complex sets
of computer instructions, they are usually written by anonymous
programmers as pranks, or in the case of Michelangelo, in a deliberate
effort to destroy the information of people the programmer has never
met.
   Fighting the virus writers is a coalition of software companies,
academics, researchers and users of personal computers.  The two play a
constant cat-and-mouse game -- virus writers sometimes send their
creations to the experts as a challenge.
   If an infected floppy disk is put into a computer, the virus orders
the machine to copy it onto any other disk that the computer contains,
generally without the operator knowing that this is taking place.  Or a
virus may enter a computer when its operator receives infected software
programs from a computer "bulletin board" reached by phone.
   Many viruses are considered benign, doing little more than flashing
whimsical messages on the screen or playing a tune.  But others, like
Michelangelo, are engineered to seek out stored data and destroy it,
sometimes on a specific date.
   That can be devastating.  Companies might lose all of their account
records, for instance, or an author using a home computer might lose the
entire manuscript of a novel.
   To dissect Michelangelo and find out how it works, security experts
have deliberately introduced the virus into test computers and advanced
their internal clocks to March 6 to trigger the virus.
   Michelangelo-infected machines that are not functioning on March 6
will not activate the virus, according  [end of story on page A24]

Page A25.   COMPUTER USERS WARNED TO GUARD AGAINST VIRUS
to experts.  By the same token, the virus can be kept dormant by
shifting the clock on the machine so that in never reads March 6.
   Computer experts agree that getting hit by a virus -- more than 1,000
types have been identified over the years -- can be devastating as
society progressively puts more and more reliance on computers.  But
there is continuing debate as to how prevalent the programs really are.
   "I'm finding virus catastrophes everywhere," said Martin Tibor, a
data recovery consultant in San Rafael, Calif., whose repeated calls to
the media after the Leading Edge incident help publicize Michelangelo.
"These things are replicating like crazy."
   David Stang, director of research at the National Computer Security
Association, offers a more conservative assessment.  While stressing the
danger of viruses, he puts the probability of a virus residing in a
given computer at a large company at about 1 in 1,000.  Michelangelo
constitutes a tiny fraction of those viruses, he said.
   The National Institute of Standards and Technology has 5,000 personal
computers and has detected about one to three viruses a month since last
summer.
   In contrast, Total Control Inc., an Alexandria computer security firm
said that about 70 percent of the 300 personal computers at one unnamed
federal agency have been found to have Michelangelo.
   San Jose research firm Dataquest Inc. surveyed 600 large U.S.
companies late last year and found that 63 percent had found a virus on
at least one company computer.  However, it noted that these companies
often operated hundreds of computers.
   Antiviral software has created a thriving new niche for the personal
computer software industry.  Such products can be purchased in software
stores or obtained for free or at a nominal cost through on-line
computer networks.
   Antiviral software is not foolproof, however.  "You can't write a
generic program that detects every virus," said Hoffman, noting that new
strains are always appearing.
   Some computer users suggest that the antiviral software companies
want to stoke fear to build a market for their products.
   Consultant Tibor conceded that the calls he made to the media were in
part motivated by hopes of bringing business his way -- it in fact
brought in only one client, he said.  But his main motivation, Tibor
said, was to get the word out about a serious computer danger.
   "I see the victims of viruses all the time," he said.  He calls
viruses "the digital equivalent of germ warfare."
