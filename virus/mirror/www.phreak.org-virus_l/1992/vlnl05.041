Subject: Will Write Protection Prevent Virus Infection? (PC)

I have a simple question:

If I set the attributes of all the executables, overlays, and COM
files in my hard drive to be read-only, will this reduce the chances
of getting virus infection?

I understand that viruses usually get transmitted by modifying these
files.  And since these files are rarely required to be read-write,
(maybe during the installation only) I do not think that the
applications would mind setting the attributes to read-only.

Thanks.  I was sure there was a logical reason, but I had not heard
it.  I think the policy of not naming a virus in such a way as to
include a company or product name is a very good one.  (I suppose it
could have been called the 'ALL RIGHTS RESERVED' virus, but that would
be silly :-)

>Sorry to disappoint you, but CLEAN 86-B does not remove this virus.

After my previous post, I was able to check a copy of clean 86b and,
of course, you are right.  I was hopeful that it would be capable of
removing the virus, but it is not.  I think I had seen something that
indicated it might, but now I don't remember.  Oh well, maybe sometime
soon.

Anyway, thanks for the clarifications...

No, virus can't use text files or any other non-executable files for
spreading. Virus needs to be executed and since text files can't be
executed, virus can't spread via them. There are some viruses which
infect data files, but those infected data files can't spread the
virus any further. For example, Cinderella and 4096 viruses do this,
because of the way they check the file extensions.

(BTW, this should be on the FAQ list...)

I haven't looked at the date check routine in Michelangelo, so I'll
comment only this.  Just like Stoned Michelangelo infects only
diskettes in A: drive.  If the virus was introduced to hard disk from
5.25" floppy (A:) and then A: drive was changed to 3.5" floppy,
Michelangelo will infect 3.5" floppies then just normally.

What can I say? This should be pursued: it could explain
Michelangelo's "commercial success".  Anyone want to bet someone
somewhere is trying hard to cover something up?  Not necessarily in
this case: don't call the slander lawyers on me yet! But it is
becoming increasingly obvious Michelangelo got lucky in a big way,
probably with some wholesale supplier of some fundamental software, if
not from the software house itself.

VDefend, VSave, and VWatch, from Central Point Software (included in
their Central Point Anti Virus and PC Tools 7.1 packages) contains
several of the same virus signatures that are used by the VIRUSCAN
series.  While this is not too uncommon--there are some viruses for
which there is only one reliable signature string--the Central Point
programs do not encrypt or otherwise cipher their search strings in
memory, causing VIRUSCAN (et al) to erroneously report a virus when it
comes across VDefend (and cousins) in memory.

Since the CP programs weren't in memory at the time WSCAN was run,
no "viruses" were found in memory.

Quite correct.  Because of this problem, I would not recommend that
you use CPAV and SCAN together on the same system without removing
CPAV and then powering to clear memory prior to running SCAN.

Hey, I really don't want this to turn into a matter of look at how

Hello,

some times ago i detected with an old version of mcaffee scan a stoned
virus on a hard disk and cleaned it with mcaffees cleaner. Now the
newer versions from mcaffee don't find the virus any more. When i
activate vdefend from pctools 7.1 it informs me that there is a stoned
virus.  f-prot202 says its suspicious, maybe a ne form of stoned but
won't disinfect it. Since i don't have the virus removal from central
point i would ask if clean only partitially erases the stoned to
disable it and if it's possible that vdefend and scan look for a
different part on the stoned virus to detect it. virx20 doesn't find
anything at all and maybe this is just a marketing gag.

Sincerly
Please write to me directly cause i normally don't read this list.

Thanks to Mickey Waxman, who provided the solution to this problem.
I'm posting the solution to virus-l for any other DOS 2.1 users out there.

Sure enough, copying the F-Prot files to the hard drive and then
running F-Prot works! This is a fine solution- it ought to be on the
hard drive anyway.

>  Uh  ,oh!  You do have a harddisk, don't you?

If someone does not have a hard drive it's really not a problem- scan
the boot disk on another machine and make sure it's clean, then write
protect the boot disk and ALWAYS boot from that disk. It's really
machines with hard drives that I'm more concerned about anyway.

Again, this is something we can live with. I think everything ought to
be scanned anyway.

I guess that this subject has been already beated down to death, but
nevertheless, here is some more information.

In one of my previous postings, I said that the problem seems to be
fixed in DOS 5.0. Well, it isn't. I am using NDOS 6.01 with MS-DOS 5.0
right now and was able to reproduce the problem by using the command

	dir aux

Since the main difference between directory searches between
COMMAND.COM and NDOS (4DOS) is that the former uses FCBs, while the
latter uses file handles.

Therefore: The device drivers are visible as files, when you perform a
file handle FindFirst/FindNext (INT 21h/AH=4Eh, AH=4Fh) on a file name
equal to the name of the device driver (no wildcards).

It depends on the particular virus. Most viruses first install

In this particular example (Michelangelo) - Yes. This particular virus
does the following when booted from an infected floppy:

	1) Installs itself in memory;

	2) Checks whether the hard disk is infected and infects it if
it isn't;

	3) Checks for the activation date and overwrites the
disk(ette) it has been booted from, if the date is March 6th. The
GetDate function is performed via INT 1Ah, so the virus will not
cativate on computers that do not support it (mainly old XTs);

	4) Loads the original boot sector and transfers control to it.
This original boot sector will look for the DOS files and print the
"Press any key" message if they are not found.

However, some other viruses act in a different way. For instance, Ping
Pong will infect the hard disk only if you access it. The hard disk is
first accessed (after the infected boot sector has received control)
only when DOS is loading and the devices initialized. So, the
following scenario holds:

	1) You put a non-bootable diskette, infected with Ping Pong in
drive A:;

	2) You switch the power on;

	3) The virus installs itself in memory;

	4) It transfers control to the original boot sector, which
displays the "Press any key" message;

	5a) If you now switch the machine off (or just press
Alt-Ctrl-Del) and replace the diskette with a non-infected bootable
one, the virus is gone.

	5b) If you replace the infected diskette with a bootable one
and press the "any" key, DOS will be loaded from this diskette, the
virus will be active in memory (and your bootable diskette infected,
if it is not write-protected), and your hard disk infected, even if
you have not explicitely accessed drive C: (because DOS itself has
done this already).

Right, that is why most people keep getting re-infected by Stoned,
Michelangelo, etc... Educate the users!

Depends on the virus. Most probably - yes.

more questions.

In short, no virus is able to survive the Alt-Ctrl-Del IN GENERAL.
What I claim is:

1) You insert an infected diskette and execute the virus from it. The
virus installs itself in memory, but does not write anything on the
diskette or the hard disk (there might be no hard disk, and the
diskette might be wrte-protected.

2) You replace the infected diskette with a clean, write-protected,
system diskette.

3) You press Alt-Ctrl-Del.

4) You observe the same "booting picture" as usual, i.e. the usual
messages displayed by the BIOS during the boot process.

5) When the boot process is completed, the virus is still active in
memory.

6) This works on all kinds of computers, not only on some weird ones
(for instance, it could be achieved on standard IBM XTs, on computers
with EMS, on 80386-based machines, etc., but this does not fit the
"general" scheme).

Well, I claim that no virus is able to achieve all of the above.

True, there are at least two viruses, which try really hard to fake a
true reboot. These are Joshi and Alabama. However, since they are
using INT 19h to chain to the warm reboot sequence, they will either
hang the machine if there are any TSRs loaded, or will not display the
original "reboot picture". The way to achive this on -some- machines
(like the mentioned above) is achievable, however, and I can explain
it to you privately, if you don't know it already.

ANyone know of a virus that could not be detectable by most scanners
that would cause any or all of the following:

		Cant Boot off Hard Drive (sometimes)
                System wont recognize Fast Ram (sometimes)
                Causing Guru's While Disk I/o
                Guruing W/o disk I/O
                System just freezes

Maybe its not a virus at all but one of the highly intergrated chips
that just gave up.  (its a rather old A500).

Your thought will be GREATLY appreciated.

Subject: viruses in general-=help

I've just scanned the last 200 messages on this newsgroup to try to
get a feel of how viruses work more specifically.  My employer doesn't
understand the ramifications of a virus not detected on a pc and is
relucatant to have software always check the system each time it is
powered up.

Is it not true that checking on weekly or bi-weekly intervals for a
virus infection is not dangerous?

Does anyone know how long it takes for a "new" virus to enter the
market (public domain) after the latest anti-virus software package is
released (i.e. do the virus-writers wait until the latest anti-virus
software is released before they come up with a new virus)?

Methods of virus infection, or types of virus infection, can include:
boot sector, .EXE and .COM files, device drivers.  Are there any
others that I'm missing?  Can non-executable (i.e. data files) be
infected with escape character sequences, etc?

Any information is greatly appreciated!
