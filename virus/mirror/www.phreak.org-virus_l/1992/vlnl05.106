A screwed up diskette can make your machine hang, nothing
more. Maybe you wish also to consider the probability of a computer
virus being spontanely created when writing a program? Say, due to a
bug or because a cosmic particle flipped some bits in your computer's
memory? :-) No, there are two other possibilities, which are much more
probable:

1. If you mistype the DIR command (say to DIE) and there is an
executable file named DIE, and your current drive/directory is the one
containing this file, and the file contains a virus, THEN you'll
actually execute the virus.

2. If you have the ANSI.SYS driver installed and it allows keyboard
reampping, then a clever volume label of the diskette, containing ANSI
escape sequences could remap one of your keys (say, Enter or
Backspace) to start a single-character named program which might
contain a virus.

Both of the examples above are more trojan-like attacks. The point is
that it is IMPOSSIBLE to get infected from a normally infected
diskette if you simply DIR it.

Again, this is speculation with close-to-impossible things. A much
more valid argument is that some data get actually executed or
interpretted - a PostScript file for instance.

It all started with a simple edit of an autoexec.bat file with DOS 5.0

Subject: Infection by the DIR command (PC)

I read in the last issue of this list that there is still doubt
about one getting infection from a diskkete after a DIR. Indeed
it can happen.
I got a virus in a infected diskette  that does just that. The
virus is in the boot sector and the scan89b tells it is the
STONED but I think it is not. That message "Your PC is now Stoned"
is not there and instead there is another message (dirt message
in fact, so I am not writing it here).
 I saved the first two sector of the infected floppy into a disk
file and I will send it if someone is interested in studying this
virus.

  The fact is: put a floppy infected by this virus into your PC
drive A (make sure the hard drive is free of virus beforehand)
and issue the dos "DIR" command and you will get a infected hard
drive.
  Now just a theory about this virus: maybe the problem is in DOS
(I am using DOS 5.00).  Some weird things happens in this version
of DOS. For instance: to make a bootable diskette you can just
copy the three system files to the diskette using the COPY command
and your are done. There is no need to use the SYS command or
to format the diskkete with the /S switch. Observe that this
only work if the diskkete was formatted with version 5.00 of dos.

Could anybody let me know about the virus Tequila farm. viscan found
it but has no cure for it. I cleaned it from the MBR using the fdisk
/mbr.

Other files still infected were all exe files involved in  the boot
procedure. these were network exe files. Is it safe to just delete and
replace the infected files or should we just fdisk the whole box and
restore? ... this is a suggestion i am at present resisting as i would

   I see your point. The weakest link of the chain theory is not as
significant in non-networked environments, but it is valid in LAN
environments. However, let me correct one misunderstanding: VDS can
be used on workstations to contain the spread. The integrity checker
is not meant to be installed on network servers. In such environments,
the LAN OS provides enough muscle to protect the server. Of course,
whether that muscle is put to proper use is another question. The
workstations, on the other hand, should be the main concern, since
they can reintroduce the infection.
  Right now (VDS 2.10), the biggest compatibility problem is compressed
drives. But you must admit that compressed drives are radically different
than DOS drives in their organization. If you try to peek beneath the
device driver doing the real-time compression/decompression, you will
not see good ol' DOS directories, FATs etc. We plan on releasing a version
of VDS that will work on such systems. However, VDS on non-compressed
drives is a little more secure due to its implementation.

  The fact is that large organizations tend to stick with IBM or brand
name stuff like Everex with MS/PC DOS, and shy away from such things as
DR DOS, etc. Our surveys were NOT limited to individuals. For example,
PS/2s are still in vogue despite their hardware compatibility problems
and limited availability of parts and so on.

   I was just pointing out the pieces in the VDS package. If you cannot
get the integrity checker to work because you have a compressed drive, then
you may very well choose not to use VDS. After all, the trial version is
meant to give the users an idea about the product so that they can make
a reasonable decision. We can only invite people to try it, nothing more.

  No surprises sir. Trial version is freely available. Besides, VDS does
not claim to run under such systems yet. Things change in time. If there
is enough demand, we will very likely add options to address user requests.

   Agreed; compatibility is important. As far as future compatibility,
that's where the upgrades come into play. Almost every major piece of
PC software needed some kind of upgrade either for compatibility or
glitch fixing. Nothing new. If you are looking for something that runs
today AND will run with all new software packages in the future, that's
not realistic.

   Well, you know we could not care less what some virus-ignorant
reviewer said about VDS. Not good for marketing, but we are more
of researcher types than marketers. Those magazines are better
suited doing comparisons of printer ribbon quality and such :-))

   I think this should go to FAQ. Anyone familiar with Netware knows that
it comes with a standard utility called SECURITY that does such checks. It
is located in the SYS:SYSTEM directory. You can use the following command
to capture such info in a file:

  Just a few additions:
  The virus tries to preseve the original time/date stamp as well as the
  attribute of the files it infects. It also hooks Int 24h (critical error)
  during disk access. The virus uses "standard", handle-oriented file
  access, and therefore may very well infect improperly setup LAN server
  software.
  The virus Int 21h handler contains an internal counter. It is checked
  during File Open requests to see if it reached 6.
 All interrupt hooking is done in a "standard" way using DOS 25h/35h of
 21h. The way virus installs itself looks legitimate enough to fool such
  sophisticated memory resident scanners as UTRES easily. The virus
  does not do any serious attempts to implement stealth techniques and
  decoys can be easily used to catch it.

Subject: a small misunderstanding :-) (PC)

In a prior posting I described a hardware device using flash EPROMs which
contained a copy of the DOS operating system and a copy of some scanning
software and which further acted as the boot diskette for the device. I
also made the following statement:

description of an EEPROM-based scanner deleted]
>> if not a red light.  Since the flash EPROMs function as the boot
>> device, there is no possibility of boot sector infection, or infection
>> of any kind by any infected disks.

To which Bontchev replied:

>It's a bit too strong to claim that "infection of any kind is not
>possible"... Since what you describe is nothing more than a scanner,
>this means that any virus unknown to the scanner will be able to
>infect the disk.

While I agree with the statement that the device I describe cannot catch
all viruses since it does use just a simple scanner, I still state that
infection of any kind by infected disks of the EPROMS (i.e., the DOS
operating system and the scanning software) is not possible.  The EPROMS
can only be written to if a hardware switch is set to on.  Thus, in operation
they are no more susceptible to infection than a write-protected diskette
containing the same software.  Since the machine is always booted from the
clean write-protected EPROM, and the EPROMs are protected by a hardware
switch, infection is impossible.  This is not to say that this device will
guarantee that all diskettes which are cleared are necessarily clean, since
it is no more accurate than the scanner.  Perhaps Bontchev misunderstood to
what I was referring with my statement.  Hopefully this clears it up.

Sincerely,

This is known as the "mutation engine", alias MtE.  I haven't seen
Infoworld, it is rather scarce this side of the pond, so I cannot
comment on the actual article.

Early encrypting viruses, such as Cascade, were as you described -
with a static portion carried between each generation to perform the
self-decryption.

Viruses using the MtE are of a class known as polymorphic, where
the self-decrypting portion DOES change.  The magnitude of change varies,
but MtE is extreme as it randomly generates new encryption/decryption
variations.  Both the MtE and the decryption routines generated have
a large amount obfuscation included.  It is thus difficult to calculate
how many variations MtE can produce or to accurately determine what they
might all look like.

I suggest you refer to the recent discussions about polymorphic viruses
in the back issues of virus-l digests.

Subject: Re: Virus hides in printer (again)

I read that New Scientist article this morning and was going to
ask for anyone who new of this "NEW" virus and how to test for it.

One point to make is that general PC users are very susceptable
to these types of stories ( me to (sort of) - because you can never
underestimate the ingenuity of these virus makers).

My main problem is that other site PC users will read these
articles too; and it is easy for people to
blame printer problems on viruses if they get the chance
(if only they would learn to load the correct printer driver, or
select the correct printer mode)

This "virus" sounds similar to two hearsay "viruses" I was verbally told
about a few years ago :-

One supposedly changed the VDU raster speed so the monitor caught fire

The other supposedly instructed the floppy disk to seek track 1
in a musical fashion eventually wrecking the disk-drive.

(If anyone has heard the same stories, could they suggest their origins)

Unless the wrong people might be given ideas, I would also be
interested in hearing from people on the theoretical limitations
viruses would have in giving self-destruct commands to the hardware,
and strategies to prevent or protect from these types of attacks; as
the people writing viruses must have this in the back of their mind.
If this is not appropriate for public discussion, please E-mail the

  Not a problem!  I went to the drugstore last night, bought me a couple
of mouse traps, and laid them in strategic places in my printer.  Baited
'em with an old copy of CPAV I had lying around. ;-)
  Seriously, though.  I suppose it's possible that a virus in font's
clothing could be downloaded to a printer.  But how, exactly, do you
suppose it could "run back down the printer lead"?  Sounds to me like
somebody's been into the mushrooms again.  Don't throw your printer out
the window just yet.

Neither was Hitler's diary.  Doesn't make it any less of a hoax.  By any
chance, does this magazine print a lot of articles on Liz Taylor's private
life?

Subject: Re: Why a good virus is a bad idea?

One point not so far mentioned is that "good" and "bad" are relative
terms.  All viruses in existence are seen at least by their authors as
"good", and sometimes other people also think they are "good".
Perhaps they see viruses as a way to combat the military-industrial
complex, or to fight for software freedom, or some such.  So we
already have what Vesselin is proposing!

Subject: Where can I find Virus signatures? / how can I get them?

I have a question to for the entire consortium in this group.
    I have just recently started working on a project which I have called:
    (DOK-V) Database Of Known Viruses.  When finished, it will be a relational
    Database program of all currently known viruses. This database will contain
    all pertinent information on currently known viruses (i.e. name, discovery
    damage done, virus lenght, etc... etc... etc.. And will also include the
    Virus's Signature information. as well as multiple cross references, and
    user queries.

Now, since this database will be including Virus signature information, I will
need to get my hands on all the Virus Signatures that I can. My question is:

 1. Are there any lists availible containing all known virus signatures?
     1a. where can I find them?

 and 2. How can I get them?

 any assisatnce from any and all readers of this group would be greatly
 appreciated?

As Vesselin noted..

Exactly. A DOS batch file contains ONLY references to the applications
the author wishes it to invoke. Now tell me you can't manipulate a
batch file so it executes a little extra on the side. Remember that
inane-looking REM statement in the AIDS Trojan's AUTOEXEC file?

Most Windows applications infected by *DOS* viruses won't run after
infection, just like most DOS applications infected by CP/M viruses
won't run after infection. But (a) one could write a CP/M virus
which *would* work under DOS (CALL 5 is still there, don't forget :-)
and (b) you can certainly write a Windows virus which will work under
Windows!

Well, for DOS PCs, one can create a "fairly secure channel" by the
tried-and-tested expedient of a clean boot. One of the delights of
DOS is that you can *still* keep the operating system and a non-
negligible set of utilities on a single, 360KB floppy disc. If
you've ever installed Open Desktop on a PC without a tape streamer
(>70 DS-HD discs :-) you'll appreciate the reliable simplicity
of this solution...

Subject: Antiviral comparison chart, 2nd draft (general)

I have incorporated some changes in the second draft of the review reference
chart.  Aside from some minor updates of information, the major change is the
inclusion of disinfection as a functional "type".  Because of this, the "D"
code has been changed to an "I" (for integrity checking).

So far I have had relatively few responses or updates.  From past experience, I
take this to mean that most people are satisfied with the results.

===================================
There are intergrades between an ordinary program and a virus:-
(0) Ordinary program.
(1) Program with 'copy self' command.
(2) Ditto that also looks around for where it can copy itself and tells the
    user those places so he can use them as args to its 'copy self' command.
(3) Program that looks around for where it can copy itself and then copies
    itself into those places, asking the user's permission each time.
(4) Program that looks around for where it can copy itself and then copies
    itself into those places, not asking the user's permission: Virus!

I think that there should be another one:

  Richard's Third Law of Data Security:  If you do turn the computer on,
  don't use it.
