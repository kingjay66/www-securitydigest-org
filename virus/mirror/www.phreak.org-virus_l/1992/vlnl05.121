VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  (The complete set of posting guidelines is available by
FTP on cert.sei.cmu.edu or upon request.) Please sign submissions with
your real name.  Send contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU
(that's equivalent to VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).
Information on accessing anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue
archives is distributed periodically on the list.  A FAQ (Frequently
Asked Questions) document and all of the back-issues are available by
anonymous FTP on cert.org (192.88.209.5).  Administrative mail

Remember scanners have applications where nothing else will do:
1.  Vetting of incoming software before use, some destructive viruses can
    cause damage the very first time their run.
2.  Identifying the cause of a suspected intrusion.  I expect to see some
    products attempt exact identification of viruses found before the end
    of the year.
3.  Trace back of the virus's propagation, by identifying media and PCs
    where the same strain of virus is present.

Having only looked at Pogue so far, I drew the incorrect inference that the
later MtE version exists in Fear &/or Dedicated.

It is the MtE generated decryptor that is corrupt - I can see no way in
which any code in Pogue, other than the MtE, could be causing this effect.

My assertion was based upon my reliance on Vesselin's previous claim of
multiple versions of MtE, in which case viruses using all versions would
need to be tested.

Certainly a number of protection techniques are made possible or more
reliable by using an add-in adapter card.  For example the program ROM on
such a card has an opportunity to execute before the PC boots, virtually
assuring a virus free environment.  I don't know anything about Certus's
product, but I expect Joe Wells will illuminate us all.

Sounds like the "Knoxcard", which is imported into the UK by a company which
seems to have little technical understanding of viruses or the operation of
their product.

At the software level it is simlar to a virus writer who has access to an
anti-virus software product, his virus could equally detect that product
and circumvent it.  Practically such a card has several advantages, in this
respect at least: relatively few of any one type of card will be in use
(price & production limits), so the virus writer is unlikely to have the same
type of card as you; the card may be bypassed but code cannot be easily
patched, because it is in ROM; the card will always be run at the next re-boot,
but software can be patched or deleted to prevent any further use.

I am interested enough to be experimenting with such boards, which I hope
to show to potential evaluators in a month or two, for comment as to which
features ought to included in a production edition.  Prefered criteria for
such evaluators: UK based (allows me to visit and/or provide telephone
support); testing on "vulnerable" PCs where there is a high probability of
encountering wild viruses, eg students pools at universities.

Well, in that case, it is not "correct to throw it away", is it? If
they are to use a multi-level defence, shouldn't they keep the scanner
anyway, as one component of the multi-level defence?

(This doesn't mean that I disagree with your earlier conclusions)

Vess: The integrity management I was talking about includes knowlege of what
      the processor memory is supposed to look like as well as the programs.

Here, I was referring to an encouraging trend, not the current products. The
anti-viral product vendors are evolving, I agree they are not there yet, but
are now going in the right (IMHO) direction.

>> systems first determine that *something* has happened before trying to

Again, this includes memory changes as well as program. For the so-called
"slow infectors" to infect-on-creation, they must be memory resident and
*that* can be detected.

Also, again IMHO viruses, at least of the kinds we know about, are not much
of a threat to a vigilant system even now. However, I agree that it is possible
to defeat any known system, but today the "bad guys" are less likely to
use a virus than a worm, trojan, or directed attack. The *children* will
continue to play with viruses but what I am concerned about are professionals.

(note: please remember that I live in a "different" environment).

Subject: HDTUNE.ZIP trojan (PC)

Someone uploaded a small program called HDTUNE.ZIP to our BBS.

The program is supposedly a hard drive optimizer but it is only about
4.K, so it is obviously not a normal hard drive optimizer.

Scan v.91 and F-prot 2.04 (Secure and Heuristic) don't flag it as
anything.

A user downloaded it and tried it, and it erased his hard drive. He has
no fragmented files now, but that is not how he expected it to happen.

After hearing this, I removed the file and looked at it.

The EXE file contains the text "Ok, asshole.  Your dead."

This program should probably be detected as a Trojan horse.

	Hi!  Last night I was trying to install windows on my
386-40MHz and I came across a very interesting dilema.  It ran the
first time without a problem.  The second time it told me that
win386.exe was corrupt.  I run NAV.EXE (Norton Anti Virus) and it said
that it was corrupt too.  I downloaded another copy from a friend and
the file increased by 1808 bytes.  I copied it to another directory
and it increased by another 1815 bytes.  I copied it over twice more
and the size stayed the same.  Also, my machine appeared to slow down
somewhat.  I also got a rectangle 6 lines by 12 rows of a different
color on the screen.  This box also moved the text above it by a few
lines.

	I'm not really sure what this is.  Sounded like a virus to me
so I just wanted to check.  This happen to anybody anytime?  I would
appreciate any help.  Thanks in advance.

Norton Desktop V1.0 has *known* problems similar to what you describe
when it is running under win3.1. Try changing back to the Windows
program manager and see if that helps, however, Ross' best bet is to
upgrade to Norton Desktop V2.

In Africa, one required smallpox jabs long after the last recorded
case had faded from people's memories. Of course, not long after
everyone had finally stopped asking you to show innoculation
certificates at their border posts, along comes a scare: someone who
had recently holidayed in Borneo, or somewhere, had been admitted to
hospital with the dreaded smallpox! Probably an urban legend, but
there you are.

Anyway, towrards the end of 1990, the Harare (or Superhacker) virus
popped up in Harare, Zimbabwe. Although it apparently turned out to
have been written in Scotland (isn't epidemiology wonderful..), the
virus got the name Harare from its first reported appearance. This is
a poor virus: run an infected file and you'll instantly see the virus
ask you to Insert diskette for drive B:, then drive A:. Only on a twin
floppy system could this thing get anywhere. This was a flash in the
pan; a virus doomed to extinction.

A year later, it resurfaced in Johannesburg, South Africa (1200km
South of Harare). Presumably some happy-go-lucky schoolboy virus
collector let it escape from his butterfly jar in a class lab filled
with twin-floppy PCs. So much for extinction..

Still, dropping (or at least having an option to drop) "old" viruses
might not be a bad idea. Lots of support calls I get revolve around
users who take fear at the sight of "extinct" viruses reported by
their favourite scanner. We've had some pretty rare viruses around
theses parts of late -- all false alarms, of course. Naturally, the
apparent rarity of such "viruses" only serves to convice users that
it is to be expected that the other n pirated scanners they have
should miss the virus. After all, doesn't "rare" have something to do
with "hard to find"...

Anyway, here's another feather in Vesselin's "integrity checker" cap.

This is a good idea, and may aid some scan algorithims, unfortunately very
few viruses use such a simple encryption.  So far as I can recall, for all
viruses where this may be applied the actual decryption code is relatively
easy to scan for.  Also this technique may be more susceptible to giving
false alarms, (the domain of matching byte sequences is larger).

Subject: F-PROT 2.04a released (PC)

Because of a few minor problems with version 2.04, I have released a
minor update, named 2.04a.  It is not necessary to upgrade, as the
problems are relatively minor, but I would recommend it though.

The problems were:

    Virstop could not be installed with the "Install" option, but
    had to be copied to the target directory.

    The program would occasionally report that files infected with
    certain variants of the Dark Avenger, SVC, Cascade and V2Px
    families had been modified, by adding some extra bytes to the
    end.  This had no effect on detection/removal of the viruses,
    however.

    The virus information database was fixed a bit - sometimes the
    names used there did not correspond exactly with the names the
    scanner reported, for example "SADAM" and "SADDAM".

I just uploaded FP-204A.ZIP to my usual archive sites:

      141.210.10.117 oak.oakland.edu
      129.109.9.21 eugene.utmb.edu
      192.88.110.20 wsmr-simtel20.army.mil

However, the programs might not be avaialble for downloading, until they
are moved to their proper directories by the archive administrators.
