VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  (The complete set of posting guidelines is available by
FTP on cert.sei.cmu.edu or upon request.) Please sign submissions with
your real name.  Send contributions to VIRUS-L@LEHIGH.EDU.
Information on accessing anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue
archives is distributed periodically on the list.  A FAQ (Frequently
Asked Questions) document and all of the back-issues are available by
anonymous FTP on cert.org (192.88.209.5).  Administrative mail
(comments, suggestions, and so forth) should be sent to me at:

Subject: LISTSERV cutover is complete

Just a reminder that the new LISTSERV is now in place.  Most aspects
of the cutover appear to have gone without a hitch (knock on silicon
:-).  So, please start sending submissions to <VIRUS-L@LEHIGH.EDU> and
LISTSERV requests to <LISTSERV@LEHIGH.EDU>.  Please treat the old
ibm1.cc.lehigh.edu (= lehiibm1.bitnet) address as history; although
it will continue to forward submissions to me, this functionality
should not be relied upon.

Thanks for your cooperation, and welcome to the new LISTSERV.  Oh, and
please let me know if you have any non-resolvable problems with the
LISTSERV.

Has anyone heard of a virus that prints a message in german saying - I
have deactivated you - on bootup and then locks the computer.

I don't need any tips on disinfection, I just want an ID.

Did you mean, when you installed DR DOS 6.0, memory went from 639K to
638K or that after you installed DR DOS 6.0, you noticed memory was at
639K?  A Model 30, without any funny hardware or software, will show
itself as having 639K available memory.

For the IBM PS/2 Model 30, and all PS/2s for that matter, IBM reserves
at least one K (right now, it's always 1K but there's no guarantee it
will stay that way) from top of memory for BIOS use.  This is called the
Extended Bios Data Area.  Maximum available memory as shown by CHKDSK
on any and all PS/2s will always show 639K (or less).

Hello Netters,

     Just a followup on my earlier *alledged* problems with VSHIELD and
getting a correct directory listing from the A: drive.
     First - I admit I ain't too schmart - ?:^9 - on some of this stuff.
     Second - The problem only occurred on military spec - ? - versions of
          Zenith 286s with model codings of ZWX-0248-62. The CMOS was
          somehow altered to show hardware not installed in the machine.
          A battery change and reset of the CMOS solved the DIR A:
          problem. And a scan of the system did not reveal any known
          infections.

Next question I am sure was answered in this digest prior to me subscribing.
   I have had to disinfect - ?:^( -  22 IBM compatable computers this week
due to [STONED] and of all things [MICH]. Nonetheless, just how do I download
a infected machine in order to send it to someone competent (see first above)
enough to use the information. We are still receiving diskettes from the
GULF and their associated problems.

     Please reply to email address' below so we don't bore the rest of
the VL Digest readers.

Thanx again for the help/suggestions already received off line.

Wrong in the sense that F-PROT lacks a Method-3 detection algorithm.
As I said, I have an algorithm for detecting what you call Method-3
encryption, but it seems my algorithm has a flaw in it.  As I said
before, I haven't bothered to disassemble the MtE.  I just generated a
*lot* of samples, and made sure I detected them all.  The problem with
Method-3 encryption is that is relatively rare, so although I have
over 99% detection ratio of MtE in general, I may miss a significant
fraction of the (rare) Method-3 encrypted files, which I hope I will
be able to fix as soon as I have succeeded in creating a single sample
that I don't detect.

Taking the last point first, I do suspect you (Vesselin) dispense more
of the truth than most. But that's my opinion from lurking and
listening a while. Since I can't get EMail to work from here to there,
I'll take this opportunity to say thank you. I appreciate your
postings.

I confess to having a Windows scanner in my posession - but I've never
found the need to unpack and install it. Instead I've just run the DOS
version from Windows on the odd occasion where I need to scan a
diskette. Question is, given the way Windows uses memory, have I left
myself wide open by doing this?

I don't much like Windows and use it only when I'm forced to. Perchance
my "bad" attitude has slowed my learning cycle. Would those who know
more than I do care to comment?

On a related topic;

Given that scanners are not the whole answer, just what combination
of programs and techniques is "state of the art" this month?

Please keep the responses to the user level for this one. Pretend
that I've just gotten a PC and know very little more than how to
load DOS.

A diskette with the above label an the text :
          'You cannot beat it with a Magnum 44'
was mailed in Odense, Denmark on May 7. (using an envelope belonging
to a local company that I have promised not to mention)
to an adress in Germany (Neuss).

The envelope contained a 5 1/4" HD diskette (no brand name but good
quality) with 2 notches on it and a piece of paper with the following:

(Page 1)
        (Picture of a ghost)
         Put it on the wall -
         it will remind you of the GHOST that comes.

(Page 2)
         LDS - against the law.

Due to an error of adress the envelope was returned to the company on July 3.
The diskette was party crushed and the boot sector and FAT unreadable. The
sectors (around 50%) that could be read using NORTON were emty.

The name on the label seems to trigger something on my mind - but I cannot
find the infor in the limited backlog of received mail I still have on line.

Any information would be helpfull - especially from people who has received
- - or heard of - such a mailing.

Thanx in advance

Subject: F-PROT/BBSes (PC)

I constantly receive qustions from people all over the world that
don't have FTP access, but want to obtain my F-PROT anti-virus package
from a BBS instead.  As I don't upload it to any BBS at all, I
frequently have a problem answering the question of which BBS to use.

So, what I need is basically a list, of BBSes where the SysOps have
obtained the package from Internet or another reliable source, and
where the most up-to-date version is available *very* soon after it is
released here.

If you run such a board, and would like to see it included, I would
very much like to hear from you.

Intel sells a product, called LAN Protect, which does exactly that -
monitors the network traffic on a constant basis. I wouldn't recommend
it, since it slows down the connection quite a lot and is nothing more
than just yet another scanner (and not that good, on the top of all),
but it might be exactly what you want.

Repeat after me: BEFORE DOING ANY VIRUS HUNTING, ALWAYS COLD-BOOT FROM
A NON-INFECTED WRITE-PROTECTED SYSTEM DISKETTE, in order to make sure
that there is no virus in memory.

Conclusion: CLEAN destroys the files infected with this virus that it
tries to disinfect. It does the same with several other viruses as
well. Don't rely on it for disinfection.

Huh, it's actually one and the same thing. The standard CARO name for
this virus is Screaming_Fist.Stranger. McAfee calls it Scr-2 (short
for Screaming Fist II), F-Prot calls it Enemy (although "Stranger" is
a more appropriate name), and it is indeed 696 bytes long.

Hmm, disinfecting viruses is a not very reliable thing in general -
it's always better to restore the files from clean backups. Besides,
CLEAN is very often unreliable, because it does not perform exact
virus identification. I would advise you against using it...

Hmm, have you checked whether all "cleaned" files still work?

It is; just the current version of F-Prot cannot disinfect this virus

:-) The "F-Prot people" are just Fridrik Skulason. I hope that he'll
include disinfection for this virus soon, since the virus is
definitively in the wild. The discrepancy is only in the naming and
probably F-Prot will match the CARO standard. I don't expect that to
happen to SCAN...

It's all of them, since all those names refer to one and the same
virus.

I think that there is a /CHKHI option that forces it to do so... Ah,
no, this option is present only in SCAN.

Ah, you see, that's what I meant. CLEAN is often unreliable.
Disinfecting viruses is unreliable in general. Always restore the
infected files from clean backups.

Hmm, aren't they? Are you sure that neither SCAN nor F-Prot checked

No, that cannot say that!!! I wouldn't complain much if they used the
name "Apple" for Number_of_the_Beast.A and "Orange" for
Darth_Vader.2.B. But they are calling those two completely different
viruses with ONE AND THE SAME NAME! I do not complain about their
naming scheme - it is not perfect, of course, but after all, it is a
matter of taste. What I am complaining about is their virus
identification - they have none! They are not able to distinguish
between two different (COMPLETELY different) viruses!

Version 91 of Scan is MUCH worse in identification than any previous
version.

Not if you have an unknown fast infector active in memory. Otherwise
it will be unable to infect the scanner, indeed, but will infect all
files being scanned. That's why, ALWAYS COLD-BOOT FROM NON-INFECTED,
WRITE-PROTECTED FLOPPY BEFORE DOING ANY VIRUS HUNTING!

Subject: IBM PS/2 Reference Partitions (PC)

The following is the results of infection attempts on IBM reference
partitions:

420 viruses were used to infect an IBM PS/2 56-SLC with a SCSI drive
running PC-DOS 5.0.  None of these viruses crossed into the reference
partition.

Next the reference diskette was manually infected with several file
infectors.  The reference partition was then restored.  Manual
restoration failed if COMMAND.COM was infected.  The only way that the
infections passed into the DOS (data) partition was when files such as
KP.EXE (keyboard password) were downloaded from the reference
partition to the DOS partition.

In conclusion, the reference partition can get infected by a "dirty"
reference diskette and the DOS partition can get infected under
certain special circumstances.  While it is possible to spread an
infection by this route, we really had to strain to do it.

Disinfectant 2.9 is a new release of our free Macintosh anti-viral
utility.

Version 2.9 detects the new T4 virus.

The T4 virus was discovered in several locations around the world in
June, 1992.

The virus was included in versions 2.0 and 2.1 of the game GoMoku. Copies
of this game were posted to the USENET newsgroup comp.binaries.mac and to
a number of popular bulletin boards and anonymous FTP archive sites.

The game was distributed under a false name. The name used in the posting,
and embedded in the game's about box, is that of a completely uninvolved
person. Please do not use this person's name in reference to the virus.
The actual virus author is unknown, and probably used this person's name
as a form of harassment.

The virus spreads to other applications and to the Finder. It also
attempts to alter the System file.

When the virus infects an application, it damages it in such a way that
the application cannot be repaired. When you use Disinfectant to attempt
to repair an infected application, Disinfectant removes the virus from the
file, but leaves the file damaged. You should not attempt to use such a
file. Disinfectant issues the following error message:

   ### This file was damaged by the virus, and it cannot
   ### be repaired properly. You should delete the file
   ### and replace it with a known good copy.

The change to the System file results in alterations to the startup code
under both Systems 6 and 7.  Under System 6 and System 7.0, the change
results in INIT files and system extensions not loading. Under System
7.0.1, the change may render the system unbootable or cause crashes in
unpredictable circumstances. Disinfectant cannot repair this damage to
the System file. If the virus damages your System file, you will have
to reinstall it.

If your system suddenly stops loading INITs and system extensions for no
good reason, it is a good indication that you may have been attacked by
the T4 virus.

The virus masquerades as Disinfectant in an attempt to bypass general-
purpose suspicious activity monitors like Gatekeeper. If you see an alert
from such an anti-viral tool telling you that "Disinfectant" is trying to
make some change to a file, and if Disinfectant is not running, it is a
good indication that T4 is attacking your system.

Once installed and active, the virus does not appear to perform any other
overt damage.  At least one version of the virus may display the following
message:

   Application is infected with the T4 virus.

There are two known strains of the T4 virus: T4-A (contained in GoMoku 2.0)

and T4-B (contained in GoMoku 2.1). The two strains are very similar. The
only significant difference is the trigger date. The trigger date for T4-A
is August 15, 1992, while the trigger date for T4-B is June 26, 1992.
Neither virus does anything before its trigger date. After the trigger
date, the virus begins to spread to other files and attempts to alter the
System file.

We know of an earlier third strain of the T4 virus which appears to have
been used for testing. Disinfectant identifies this strain as "T4-beta".

For those people who may have missed the news about the MBDF virus, we
added the following paragraph to the description of MBDF in the
Disinfectant online manual:

   Three undergraduate students at Cornell university have been charged
   under New York state law with multiple felony counts of first-degree
   computer tampering in connection with the release of the MBDF virus.
   They are awaiting trial.

We hope that this news will help convince potential virus writers that
computer viruses are not trivial or harmless, and that society takes the
problem very seriously indeed. Writing and releasing a virus is a
serious offence which can and should be punished under the law.

Disinfectant 2.9 is available now via anonymous FTP from site
ftp.acns.nwu.edu [129.105.113.52].  It will also be available soon on
sumex-aim.stanford.edu, rascal.ics.utexas.edu, comp.binaries.mac,
America Online, CompuServe, GEnie, Delphi, BIX, MacNet, Calvacom,

Sorry, but 99.99999999% is NOT 100%. It is APPROXIMATELY 100%.

This is a nice idea and certainly has to be researched... However,
consider this: such tool will be something standard. What prevents the
virus from using it to register the infected files as  properly
updated?

I don't see why. It is perfectly possible to corrupt the OS/2
filesystem in such a way that the operating system will boot without
problems.

I meant that it cannot be used under OS/2 for this purpose.

                        The "Lehigh" virus

The autumn of 1987 really seemed to get the ball rolling with regard
to virus research.  The first message to awaken interest was sent by
one "LUKEN" of Lehigh University.  For all the damage that the
Lehigh virus caused, we should at least be grateful that it brought
us our Peerless Leader (aka krvw).

Not all students are mini-hackers: not all students are even semi
computer literate.  Student consultants at universities and colleges
are presented with a steady stream of disks from which files have
"mysteriously" disappeared.  In November of 1987, however, it
appeared that certain of the failed disks were due to something
other than user carelessness.

The Lehigh virus overwrote the stack space at the end of the
COMMAND.COM file.  (Early reports stated there was no increase in
file size: later research showed an increase of 555 bytes in the
size of infected files.)  When an infected COMMAND.COM was run
(usually upon booting from an "infected disk"), the virus stayed
resident in memory.  When any access was made to another disk, via
the TYPE, COPY, DIR or other normal DOS commands, any (and only)
uninfected COMMAND.COM files would be infected.  A counter was kept
of infections: after four infections the virus would overwrite the
boot and FAT areas of disks with contents from the BIOS.

The primary defence of the virus was that, at the time, no one would
have been looking for it.  The date of infected COMMAND.COM files
was altered by the virus, and, when attempting an infection on a
write protected disk, the virus would not trap the "WRITE PROTECT
ERROR" message (a dead giveaway if all you were doing was a DIR).

The virus was limited in its "target population" to those disks
which had a COMMAND.COM file, and, more particularly, those which
contained a full operating system.  Admittedly, in those heady
bygone days, more users kept copies of the operating system on their
disks.  However, the virus was also self-limiting in that it would
destroy itself once activated, and would activate after only four
"reproductions".  To the best of our knowledge, the Lehigh virus
never did spread off the campus in that initial attack.  (It is,
however, found in a number of private virus collections, and may be
"released" into the wild from time to time.  As noted, it has little
chance of spreading today.)
