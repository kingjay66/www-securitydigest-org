Yes. You only need the FDISK from DOS 5.0 (and to boot from DOS 5.0
itself, otherwise the program will complain about the DOS version). It
doesn't matter what DOS version your hard disk is formatted with.

No. FDISK /MBR rewrites only the program in the MBR, whithout trying
to interpret the partition table data, so the structural differences
are not important (unless they have completely changed the format of
the PT which they haven't done). The only problem is if the 0AA55h
marker at the end of the MBR is destroyed. In this case FDISK /MBR
will rewrite the whole MBR, trying to rebuild the PT from scratch and
it may destroy some partition information. But, if the marker is
destroyed, the disk will not be accessible, if you boot from a
diskette. That's why, you must first boot from the system diskette,
then check whether you are able to access the hard disk, and then run
FDISK /MBR.

It does not have to, indeed, but if it does what you describe, then
the hard disk will suddenly become inaccessible to DOS if you boot
from a floppy. Fortunately, it seems that enough users are doing this
from time to time :-) and such viruses get discovered early enough.

Try a third experiment:

3) Fill the entire sector 0,0,1 with the letter 'E', -EXCEPT- the last
two bytes. Leave them to be 55h 0AAh. Then run FDISK /MBR. You'll see
that it will replace the program in the MBR, but will leave the PT
area filled with 'E's. Which will mean that the disk will not be
bootable, of course. (Disclaimer: I haven't verified that.)

Of course. But I never claimed that it will work against -all- master
boot sector viruses. In fact, it is possible to write a MBR infector,
without changing the part that FDISK /MBR restores at all, so that
"restoring" it will do no good... (Don't ask me about details about
this, please).

There might be a couple of other caveats... But my initiall suggestion
was to use FDISK /MBR to remove Michelangelo (also Stoned and some
others), not to use it as a cure-all against MBR infectors. And I
still claim that it can be safely used for this purpose, regarless of
the DOS version the hard disk is formatted with. It is certainly
better than the free CPAV and NAV "special editions", which are pure
crap and even cannot operate if the amount of free memory is 364 Kb or
below... :-(

Good morning. I'm trying to help a user. They are having the system
reboot on them whenever they pick any option on the main menu of
f-prot 2.02d. Their systems description is as follows:

In this particular case, I think that the warning is cause by the
unusual way the utilities are using to relocate themselves in memory.
I think this is cased by the fact that they come self-compressed, and
even unpacking them (an option during the installation process) still
leaves a small weird routine in them.

Hmm, I'm sorry, but as far as I know, the above message is NOT caused
by the heuristic analyser (Frisk?). Maybe the original poster can
confirm that he used the scanning option, not the heuristic analysis.
So, in this case it probably -is- a false positive.

What I believe Frisk does is picking a scan signature of the dropper
program (I think that the program SENDDISK creates these pesky
droppers) and then another one from the part of the file that contains
the boot sector to be dropped. In your program you are probably using
the same instruction sequence to drop your own boot sector, and in the
boot sector there might be some bytes that are present in Stoned
too... It is a false positive, it is the fault of neither of you, and
either of you can correct the problem by modifying his program a bit.
But the main cause of such problems is the lack of exact virus
identification in F-Prot.... Of course, if it begins to identify the
viruses exactly, it won't be so good in catching new variants of the
known viruses as it currently is... My suggestion is that Frisk
implements exact identification for the known viruses and moves the
code to detect new closely related variants in the heuristic analyser.

I wish I have done away with them, but nope, they are still used by
severay unsuspecting users... :-) Anyway, SCAN is very good in
detecting wheter a file or a boot sector is infected or not. The
quality of the report is poor (what exactly virus it is, what are its
properties, whith which other viruses it is related, etc.), it's
memory scan is also not implemented in the most clever way. CPAV is
 -much- worse than SCAN, regardless of its bells and whistles.

I suggest that you combine SCAN with at least F-Prot (a very cheap
alternative). If you want to spend more money, get Dr. Solomon's
Anti-Virus ToolKit. And, of course, F-Prot - the two combine very
nicely (AVTK identifies viruses exactly and detects more viruses,
while F-Prot is better in detecting new variants of the known
viruses).

But the programs above are only virus-specific scanners/removers. You
really MUST NOT repy on known virus scanning only.

Hmm.... it's a very difficult problem, especially if somebody
deliberately decides to attack your system... He could use an unknown
virus (so the scanners won't catch it, and if he's clever enough,
he'll avoid the heuristic analyser of F-Prot too), a clever tunnelling
virus (so that it will be able to bypass a monitoring program) and a
slow virus with sparse infection strategy, so that even an integrity
checker will have problems to detect it... I personally check the code
of any new program that I get with a debugger, but I guess that it is
not an acceptable approach for a shareware library... And even if you
decide to try you, the virus code could be well concealed in a
utility... No, I don't see a perfect solution for your case. Just use
a multiple level defense (scanners, monitors, integrity checkers, goat
machine for program testing) and pray that nobody who is knowledgeable
enough will decide to shut down your system... And, of course, always
verify the identity of your users.

Have you actually kept the file? This is a very silly virus and I
somehow doubt that it can spread in the wild... Maybe it was just yet
another false positive caused by CPAV? Have you tried to disinfect the
file? Did it work after being disinfected?

Hmm, if your have to list them in the order of decreasing quality, the
order should be exactly the opposite... :-) Anyway, get F-Prot at
least. It is -very- good and with the price of $1 per machine per
year, it is -really- cheap.

Adding an integrity checker on the goat machine will improve the
security A LOT. It just won't solve the problem entirely (e.g., if the
virus does not try to spread at once). If you can afford a commercial
program, get the Untouchable (marketed in the USA by Fifth Generation
Systems) and use it's integrity checker only (the other parts of the
package are not so good). If you need something cheaper, get Integrity
Master (shareware).

Hope the above helps.

Oh, they are not so rare... There are several trojans which target BBS
software (like making the list of the passwords downloadable). There
are also a few anti-BBS viruses. A clever one is Cheeba. Also, the
latest thing I just received is Creeper - a silly little virus which
has a clever triggering mechanism. It gets triggered when a particular
message is present in the video memory. Got the idea? First you wait
until the person you target is infected, then send him an e-mail
message. When s/he reads it (displaying it on the screen), the virus
triggers...

Because it is a variant of Den Zuk. McAfee uses an "optimised"

There are lots of bugs in it. First of all, it will not activate on a
computer the BIOS if which doesn't support INT 1Ah (date & time
functions). This means most XTs. Second, if you have tried to boot
from an already disinfected diskette, it obviously won't be there to
activate... :-) But in general such experiments are dangerous. I hope
that you have made a full backup of your system first. If not, you can

I can tell you only about Novell. It provides two levels of
protection: file attributes and file access rights. The file
attributes are essentially the same as in MS-DOS and provide the same
level of security (i.e. - none at all). The file access rights however
 -are- secure and cannot be bypassed from a workstation. That's why the
server must be physically secured, otherwise anyone who is
knowledgeable enough and has access to the server is able to do
whatever he wishes with the security.

> 3> Technically, there ought to be a low-level hack way to achieve

Nope, no way to do this from a workstation. But this has nothing to do
with virus spread prevention - a virus can infect the workstation and
just wait until a privileged user executes one of the infected
programs. Then the virus has supervisor rights and can do anything.

That's why it is a good idea for the person who supervises the LAN to
have -two- accounts - one privileged and one not. In his/her everyday
use, s/he must use the normal account. The privileged one must be used
ONLY when the job -really- requires supervisor rights, s/he must log
out as soon as the job is done, and never execute any of the other
users' programs. Also, all shared executable programs must be
with read-only rights.

Because, if there is ONE debugger on the server (for the convenience
of SOME users), and if it is accessible to everybody, Mr. Joe User can
use it to low-level format the hard disk of his workstation. The same
goes for Norton Utilities. However, there is NO WAY to break the
server's security from a workstation, even with a debugger.

If it is caused by a virus, it is really a new one. However, it might
be caused by a joke or trojan. I don't know them as well as I know the
viruses, but I seem to recall that there was something, called Fire.
Check the contents of your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files and make
sure that you perfectly understand what each of the program executed
from there does. Tell me if you get any results.

Vesselin

P.S. I recalled. The thing is reported as Fire trojan by F-Prot. Get a
copy of F-Prot and run it the /trojan option.

First, it is "polymorphic", not "polymorph". Second, it doesn't need
to be self-encrypting (although all of the current ones are). Third,
it doesn't need to overwrite anything, in order to be polymorphic.
Fourth, if the virus is also stealth, you won't notice the growth of
the files. Fifth, it need not to be restricted to COM files only.
Sixth, it's very easy to detect ("notice") it, if your are using an
integrity checker. The hard thing is to -recognize- it, but it is also
possible. Seventh, it's explained in the FAQ... :-)

> Has anyone heard of this virus?

It's not A virus. It's a name for a class of viruses. They exist since
more than three years.

Of course not. Any integrity checker (which is not buggy, of course),
will be able to detect the infection.

A known polymorphic virus can be detected by a virus-specific scanner,
which knows the virus. It is -very- hard to write the recognition
routine for such viruses and it usually takes a lot of time to the
virus researcher to do so, but it is possible (except in the general
case, but who cares about the general case). Of course, a
virus-specific scanner will not be able to detect a polimorphic virus
it does not know about, but this is true for every virus it does not
know about, not just for the polymorphic ones. And, of course, and
integrity checker will have no problems detecting it.

The polymorphic viruses are to the scanners what the stealth viruses
are to the integrity checkers. They "attack" the particular kind of
anti-virus software by making it more difficult to be maintained or
used.

Well, I thought that it's the alias for Stoned-2, that is, the variant
which puts the original MBR at 0,0,2. It is my understanding, that
this was the "original" virus, as programmed by that New Zealand boy.

Ahhh, of course! I was always wondering why the hell it uses sector 7,
while sector 2 is much more "obvious"... Now I understand...

Ooops, error. FORMAT C: will rewrite the boot sector of the DOS
partition, not the MBR. It will also wipe out the FATs, so "restoring"
the MBR won't help a lot...

Weeell, yes, in general, you cannot. Of course, there is always the
possibility that someone could write a trojan program which drops the
virus on your disk (the so-called droppers).

Yep, and it has been sent. Ken?

Scan will mis-identify Michaelangelo during its initial scan of RAM if
it is run on an infected machine.  Scan correctly identifies
Michaelangelo when Michaelangelo is not present in memory.

Subject: OS/2 bug or virus? (OS/2)

     I'm running OS/2 1.3.  Under OS/2, XCOPY does not change the
dates of the files it copies.  In the DOS box, the files created by
XCOPY have their dates set to the current date.  The resulting files
are the same size as the originals and COMP says they are the same.
Is this a known OS/2 1.3 bug?  Or, do I have a virus?

Wasn't it the Swiss Cracking Association? And wasn't it after the
summer of 1987 (when the first PC virus appeared)?

Unfortunately, you're lost in all aspects.  First of all, the CRC
algorithm does not add up bytes; it is computed by dividing the file
(expressed as a binary number) by a fixed number (approx. 32 bits)
and taking the remainder, except that polynomial arithmetic modulo 2
is used instead of ordinary arithmetic.
  Secondly, with a 32-bit divisor, the chance of two files having the
same CRC is only 1 in 4,300,000,000, hardly a significant probability.
  Finally, files cannot be *restored* by using a CRC; that would be
like being able, simply by knowing only the divisor and remainder of a
division, to determine what the original dividend was.  However, a CRC
can be used to tell you (with extremely high probability), after a
file has been restored by *other* means, whether the restoration was
accurate.
