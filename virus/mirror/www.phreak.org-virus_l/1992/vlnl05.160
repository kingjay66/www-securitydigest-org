Uh, F-PROT 2.05 recognizes it, although it gives a false alarm in one
case (PKLITE'd BACKUP.EXE, I think)....sorry, fixed in 2.05a.

If you find one, let me know :-)

Seriously, there is no list that is 100% up to date - with several new
viruses arriving every day it is not possible.  You can get a
reasonably good list from several sources, but no 100% complete.

> - - are StarDot and V801 related?

I have no idea what NAV calls "V801", but the StarDot virus indeed has
such variant. In fact, it has variants with infective lengths 600,
789, and 801. Assuming that NAV calls StarDot.801 "V801", I suspect
that it has messed the two StarDot variants - StarDot.789 and
StarDot.801.

BTW, please not that this virus "pads" the files before infection in
such a way, that their size becomes a multiple of 16. Therefore, while
the length of the virus is 600/789/801 bytes, it can add more than
this amount of bytes to the infected files.

It isn't stealth at all, and it does NOT survive warm boots.

Umm... it depends on the particular virus. For some viruses you can,
for some you cannot restore the original file exactly. The StarDot
viruses are one example of viruses, for which it is not possible to
restore the file size exactly. Another example is the good old
Jerusalem - you cannot disinfect more EXE files correctly.

Therefore, it is always a good idea not to rely on disinfection, but
simply to delete all infected files and to restore them from clean
backups.

No, Stoned + Michelangelo = bye-bye boot sector, not FAT. The FAT is
damaged only no some (almost not used today) hard disks, and for these
hard disks you don't need both viruses - either of them will do...

Are those the -first- few bytes of the boot sector? If yes, then the
boot sector does not contain a virus, it is just damaged. The damage
could have been done by a virus, but there is no virus in the boot
sector.

The reason for this is that the Drive Parameter Block table in the
boot sector is damaged.

The damage might have been caused by a buggy program, yes.

Hmm, I don't know whether the thing that you want exists... You could
consider the following options:

1) Patricia Hoffman's VSUM. Shareware hypertext information about IBM PC
viruses. Contains A LOT of information. Drawbacks: most of the
information is incorrect and/or incomplete. Some of the virus variants
listed even do not exist. Available from many places, including ours:

ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de:pub/virus/progs/vsumx208.zip

2) The Computer Virus Catalog, published by VTC-Hamburg (i.e., us).
Very technical, describes viruses for different platforms (IBM PC,
Amiga, Atari ST, Macintosh). Freeware, but not public domain - we
still have the copyright and you must not modify it, if you give it to
others. Drawbacks: the IBM PC platform is not covered well. Only about
10% of the existing viruses for it are described. Available from

ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de:pub/virus/texts/catalog/msdosvir.zip

3) The comparative scanner tests for FindVirus, F-Prot, and SCAN. They
also list the standard CARO name of each virus, together with the
names given by the above scanners. The list is very complete - it
lists ALL viruses from our virus collection. It is public domain -
you can do with it whatever you want. Drawbacks: only lists the
viruses. No further information about them is given, except that they
are divided into boot/MBR and file infectors. Available from

ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de:pub/virus/texts/tests/naming.zip

Try TbScanX. You can get it from Simtel20 or its mirrors:
oak.oakland.edu:pub/msdos/trojan-pro/tbscnx31.zip (unless a later
release is available, of course).

F-Prot 2.05 recognizes it too well, alas... It even reports a false
positive in some PKLited files. :-( Should be fixed in version 2.05a.

BTW, both F-Prot and SCAN allow the user to use scan strings defined
by him/herself. However, if you decide to do so, be careful not to
fall in the same trap that Frisk did - it is very difficult to select
a scan string for this virus that will not cause false positives,
since the virus is PKLited itself...

The standard CARO name of the virus that has probably infected your
computer is Yankee_Doodle.TP-44.A. F-Prot calls it "Yankee (TP-44)".
You could look in its virus help database under the entry "Yankee" or
"Vacsina" (both point to one and the same text), but have in mind that
the information about viruses in F-Prot's help database is very
limited.

I am assuming that you have set up a "dual boot" machine with a FAT
structure.  The problems with the high density drives are a dead
giveaway: it could almost be called another indicator of Stoned.

Yes, this is a common indicator of the presence of an MS-DOS boot
sector infector.  It'll work under DOS, but will not infect under OS/2
(even though it may possibly be present).

Quite so.  As long as the diskette is protected, nothing will happen
to it.  However, as you have found, Stoned (and Michelangelo) are very
infectious.  When they infect a disk (and yes, just a DIR can do it)
they reposition the original boot sector to an area that is mostly
unused on low density disks.  Unfortunately, it is vital on high
density floppies.

You probably only have one virus, although it is possible to get both.
You should boot your computer from a "known clean system disk" in
order to get the most accurate diagnosis.  You should also scan with
another scanner in addition to SCAN.  F-PROT and VIRx should be widely
available, as should TBSCAN and HTSCAN.

Stoned (and Michelangelo, which is derived from Stoned) are "boot
sector infectors".  They do not attach to program files on the disk,
but rather replace the boot sector program which has a given position
on every disk.  Specifically, they replace the "master boot
record/sector" on the hard disk, and so they are the first thing to
run when you turn the computer on.  F-PROT should be able to clean it
up for you (unless you have a more complex situation).  DISKSECURE can
also help, as possibly can running "FDISK /MBR".

Subject: Ping Pong imitation (PC)

Just a note, this may save somebody some headaches.

	I recently had what looked like the ping-pong virus with a
squished ball (the normal curser) while running Soft-PC on an apple
Powerbook.  I tried unzipping FP-205.zip using PKZIP v1.93a alpha
version, it would hang and the curser would go ping-pong fashion.  I
checked the disk with F-Prot205 and it was OK.  I went back to the
official version of PKZIP v1.10 and it would unzip OK.  My PKZIP
v1.93a would work fine on the same file of a normal 486-33 desktop
system.  It looks like some illegal instruction occurred on the
Soft-PC powerbook configuration.
	One thought on this though, with the emerging of mixed
technologies, could the Soft-PC's system areas be affected by viruses
and could they be repaired in the regular ways and I don't think that
I am able to do the standard procedure of booting from a non-infected
floppy for scanning.

Nope - you did not miss anything - there have just been some delays.
I am spending a part of my time on a major revision of the program, so
adding detection/disinfection of the 150+ new viruses does not get
quite as high priority as usually.

No need to.  I believe you.  :) The reason I originally asked was
because it was always teh same three files that registered the
infection.  Since then, it has struck again on another PC, and this
time a new file was infected, so I would agree with you in that we
have real viruses. :) Thankx for the info.

   Hi.  Does anyone know if there is a bug in VSHIELD ver 3.9 in
detection of virus programs?  The reason that I am asking is that
VSHIELD ver 3.9 recently detected the "Crypt-1" virus in one of my
programs.  Unfortunately I do not have the disinfecting program that
goes along with VSHIELD ver 3.9, and other virus dectection programs
that I have used do not dectect anything wrong with the program.  Some
of the other programs that I have used to detect it are: VSHIELD ver
5.1c, SCANV ver 8.7b, F-PROT ver 2.05, and Norton Anti-Virus.
   What ever VSHIELD ver 3.9 is detecting is apparently not spreading
as the problem is not detected in any other program of mine.  And the
program that is detected to be infected is a few hundred bytes smaller
that the original one (VSHIELD does not detect the problem in the
original or copies of the original).

    If anyone has any suggestions as to how to get rid of this
possible virus, please contact me at: B645ZJY@UTARLG.UTA.EDU

    Also if anyone has any documentation on the "Crypt-1" virus,
please E-mail that to me also (I have been unable to find any
information on it).

Well, that is the "best" solution from many points of view - but there are
two practical problems:

   1) Many (most ?) users don't keep decent backups.

   2) It takes a lot less time and effort to run a disinfector than to
      restore all files from a backup.

Subject: Computer virus used for attempted blackmail: episode 2

From UK newspaper "Daily Telegraph", Fri. 2 Oct 1992 p2:-
(Hereinafter, '#n' = 'n pounds UK')
<Computer blackmail lecturer fined #500>
  A computer specialist who threatened to put a virus in a program of
a client company in an argument over a phone bill was fined #500 and
ordered to pay #500 costs yesterday. A jury at Newcastle upon Type
Crown Court took more than siz hours to reach a 10-2 majority verdict
in the case of Dr.Roy Booth, who had denied blackmail. The computer
studies lecturer from Fieldhouse Road, Gateshead, Tyne and Wear [in NE
England], said after the hearing that his job at Newcestle University
was now in jeopardy. Dr.Booth had threatened to insert a virus into a
computer game of Imec, a firm for which he had worked, when it refused
to pay a #400 telephone bill he ran up while on a one week stay in
America. Instead it was deducted from his fee. The lecturer said he
had expected to be paid #900. The firm agreed to pay him #450 which,
with the telephone bill deducted, left him with just #50. He said he
had threatened to insert a computer virus in an attempt to "shake up"
the company and encourage it to pay him in full. He had no intention
of damaging to the program. Judge Michael Cartlidge, sentencing him
accepted that the lecturer was only trying to get back money which he
felt was due to him. But, he added: "You employed illegal methods to
do it and you should be thoroughly ashamed of what you did."

Subject: MacMag, the original data virus! (CVP)

HISVIRD.CVP   920905

                    MacMag virus - "Data" Virus

The most widely distributed early reports of the MacMag virus were
undoubtedly those relating to its appearance on the Compuserve
system.  In a sense this notoriety is unfair: even those reports
from Compuserve were prompted by the notice to Compuserve from
someone who had first downloaded the file from Genie.  Compuserve
had nothing to do with the production of the file, and it was
uploaded and distributed through other systems as well.  However,
the fact remains that the MacMag virus did get some distribution via
a Hypercard "stack" that was, for a time, posted on Compuserve.

Hypercard was the first widely available implementation of the
"hypertext" or "hypermedia" concept.  The basic idea is that related
information is "linked" so that associated data can be seen
together, or at least accessed quickly.  An example might be that in
reading email you might come across an unfamiliar term and be able
to get a definition of it.  At a higher level, when reading a news
report of some conflict, you would be able to quickly "pull up" a
map of the area, political history, studies of the ethnic groups
involved and economic data about the products and exports of the
area.  Hypercard was also seen as a development tool.

In any case, Hypercard "stacks" are essentially data bases with
internal "link" information.  As such, the initial report of the
fact that "NEWAPP.STK", supposedly a file of information on new
Apple products, actually altered system data met with skepticism.
Even then it was "known" that viral program could not spread via
data files.  When this fact was confirmed, it was erroneously
reported that MacMag was an example of a virus that could.  (I've
been guilty of this, myself.)  In fact, the NEWAPP.STK might better
be described as a "dropper".

Semantics aside, how could a data file affect the system at all?

Well, more and more programs have "macro", "script" or interpreter
capability.  Thus the distinction between data and program blurs.
Hypercard stacks have "commands" as well as data associated with
them.  Generally, these commands only govern the ability to "flip"
from one "card" to another.  However, an extended command set, XCMD,
allowed for additional functions beyond those normally available in
Hypercard.  This was used to affect the system changes.

Other systems, such as Lotus 1-2-3, have macro capabilities
associated within data files.  In theory, it is possible for a virus
to be able to switch forms from "object" to macro in the same way
that multipartite viri switch from file to boot sector format.
However, the viral code would be of considerable size.  To date no
such virus has been seen.
