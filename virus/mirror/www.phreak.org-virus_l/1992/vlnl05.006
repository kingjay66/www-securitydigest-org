Subject: Odd Problem with F-PROT 2.01 (PC)

While testing F-PROT 2.01 against my suite of captive viri, I noticed a
curious behavior.  When F-PROT prompted to "Press ENTER to scan next
diskette," I swapped diskettes, pressed ENTER, and F-PROT began scanning
the diskette, but the files it reported scanning were those on the
previous diskette.  Removing and reinserting the diskette didn't help
any.  Only when I quit and restarted the program did it scan the diskette
correctly.  However, this was 100% repeatable -- when I changed diskettes
again F-PROT reported scanning the files on the first diskette.  Other
scanners work correctly when scanning multiple diskettes, and the machine
(Unisys 3256 25MHz 386 w/12MB RAM, 3.5" and 5.25" floppies, 340MB SCSI
hard disk, DOS 4.01) is working OK.  No disk-caching programs are
resident.  Booting from a clean, pure DOS 4.01 floppy didn't help, either.
Also, this problem was only present with drive B: (5.25" 360K).  F-PROT
otherwise worked OK, and when it correctly read the diskettes, it detected
all viri presented.

Has anyone else encountered this problem with F-PROT 2.01?  Does anyone
have any ideas what might be causing this, if it's not F-PROT?  Please
excuse me if this has already been brought up -- I haven't had the
opportunity to read through all of my back issues of VIRUS-L as thoroughly
as I would like to.

All the viruses which activate on Friday 13th that I know (lots of
Jerusalems and South Africans) delete files; do not format the drive.
The Hybrid virus overwrites the hard disk, but as far as I remember,
it does this only on Friday 13th in 1992 and later...

Stoned infects 3.5" diskettes perfectly, but it only does this on
drive A: (on the first physical drive, more exactly). They have
probably installed 3.5" drives as dirve B: and/or above.

With this configuration, even if both the floppies in drive A: and the
hard disk (D:) are infected and even if the virus is active in memory,
the copies from drive B: and above will never get infected.

As I said, you cannot infect the copies you make. As to why you have
not been infected yet, I guess you just had luck and didn't try to
boot from an infected disk (that is, didn't forget an infected disk in
drive A:).

Hope the above helps.

Please don't use a light bulb. Look around the motherboard near the
built-in NiCad for an in-line 4 pin Berg connector (4 vertical pins)
which are usually provided for replacement of the NiCad by an out-
board battery. Two pins should be jumpered together, sort of like so
 
		o o o o
		+ N   -

where + and - are the usual external battery connections and N is the
positive side of the NiCad, so the + and the N would be jumpered to-
gether. The negative side of the NiCad is connected to the ground
plane of the MB. Removing the jumper and shorting + and - will drain
your CMOS. I think most MB mfrs did this so that we would not have
to take a soldering iron to a six-layer MB (shudder).

Unfortunately, I don't have the latest version of CPAV, but I'm rather
disappointed by the one I last saw. It has a lot of fancy menus but is
not a -very- good anti-virus tool. Especially having in mind that it
is based on TNTVIRUS, which is an -extremely- bad anti-virus tool.

As to SCAN, its latest version (85) is pretty good in detecting
infections. During the tests it didn't detect only about 63 different
variants of our virus collection, which consists of more than 1,000
different virus variants. Unfortunately, you must always have in mind
that you MUST NOT DRAW ANY CONCLUSIONS FROM THE SCAN'S OUTPUT OTHERS
THAN WHETHER A PARTICULAR FILE IS INFECTED OR NOT. Any information
SCAN may give you about the actual name of the virus, the number of
viruses in the file, the properties of the virus, the relationship of
the virus to other viruses, very often has nothing to do with the
truth and can be quite misleading. Fortunately, most users do not need
anything more than a program, which tells them whether any new files
they get are infected or not.

Very often SCAN uses a different name; replies to this question follow
each of the viruses you ask about.

> Also, can anyone identify any of the following that are especially

Most of them are not widespread.

> Twelve Tricks

This is not a virus, it's a trojan. It does not spread, so it cannot be
widespread. SCAN recognizes it as 12 Tricks Trojan [Tricks].

The following are boot sector viruses. I don't have them in live form, so I
was unable to test how we does SCAN recognize them.

> Golden Gate 1
> Golden Gate 2

These are supposed to be Yale variants. I have only one variant of Yale and
I doubt pretty much that others exist - until I see them.

> Stoned III

This is known also as NoINT.

> Zapper

Stoned variant.

> Den-Zuk 2

Probably the virus, called Ohio.

> Anthrax PT
> Omicron PT (More well known as Flip)

The above two are multi-partite viruses. This means that they infect both
files and boot sectors. Probably by PT the guys at CPS mean that they can
detect the virus not only in the files, but also in the partition table.
Big deal.

Well, now about the file infectors.

> Kylie
> Faggot

I never succeeded to make these work and spread. In fact, I suspect that
Faggot is a trojan, not a virus. You can guess how "widespread" they are.
Anyway, SCAN identifies them as

Kylie: Jerusalem Related [Jeru]
Faggot: VHP Related [VHP]

> 740
> April 15
> France

I don't know what they mean by these names. In general, it's a bad practice
to use a number, a date, or a place as a name of a virus. I certainly don't
know all the infective lengths of our more than 1,000 viruses by heart, but
I don't remember one with infective length of exactly 740 bytes. Maybe
Fridrik Skulason can correct me. April 15th is the activation date of a
variant of the Murphy virus, called Swami. SCAN detects is as Murphy
[Murphy]. There are at least three viruses from France; what they probably
mean is the Paris virus. SCAN detects it as Paris [Paris].

> Lunch
> PC Bandit
> Doctor
> Drug

Never heard about these. They are either new ones, or very obscure names of
old viruses.

> 805

This is probably one of the Stardot variants. SCAN detects it as V-801
[V801]. Not spread at all.

> 1590

This is probably the Green Caterpillar. Scan detects it as 1591/1575
[15xx]. Not spread.

> Amoeba 2

This is probably the Maltese Amoeba. Watch out if you live in Ireland; the
virus is quite widespread there. It's a dangerous polymorphic multi-partite
fast infector. SCAN detects it as Irish [Irish].

> Anarkia

A Jerusalem variant. SCAN detects it as Jerusalem Related [Jeru] and Fu
Manchu - Version A [Fu]. Not spread.

> Beast C
> Beast D

These are No. of the Beast variants. This virus has 13 variants, all of
them detected as 512 [512] by SCAN. Some of the variants are (not very
widely) spread in Bulgaria.

> Cascade YAP

There is a misunderstanding here; in fact two different Cascade variants
were called with this name. SCAN recognizes both as Yap [Yap]. Not spread
at all.

> Dark Lord

A Terror variant. SCAN recognizes it as Terror [Ter]. Found once in the
wild in Bulgaria.

> Decide

SCAN recognizes it as Deicide [Dei]. Not spead at all.

> Diamond

SCAN recognizes it as Alfa Related [Alf]. More exactly is to say "reports
it", since it reports like this a lot of other (completely unrelated)
viruses as well. Two variants were once uploaded to a BBS in Bulgaria.

> HIV

A Murphy variant. SCAN recognizes it as Murphy [Murphy]. Never found in the
wild.

> Horse II

There are 9 variants of the Horse viruses, so I don't know what they mean by
that. SCAN recognizes the first 8 only as Horse [Hrs] (and sometimes
reports also 512 [512], which has nothing to do here). Most of them are not
very widespread in Bulgaria, mainly in some schools in Sofia. Probably
Horse II is the last variant, which SCAN does not detect, since it is a bit
different from the others.

> Justice

SCAN recognizes it as Justice [Justice]. Once found in the wild in
Bulgaria.

> Phoenix

There are 6 variants of this virus. SCAN recognizes 800 as V800 [V800],
1226, Phoenix, Proud, and Evil as P1 Related [P1r], and V82 as [V82].
Relatively widespread in Bulgaria and several times uploaded to BBSes in
West Europe.

> Suomi

SCAN recognizes it as 1008 [1008]. Not very widespread in Finnland.

> Tequila

SCAN recognizes it as Tequila [Teq]. Widespread in West Europe, a
polymorphic multi-patrtite fast infector. Beware.

> Vienna 656

SCAN recognizes it as Lisbon Virus [Lisbon] and VHP Related Virus [VHP].
Not spread at all.

> Virdem 792

SCAN recognizes it as Burger [Burger]. Not spread at all.

> Vriest

SCAN recognizes it as Vriest [Vrst]. Not spread.

Hope the above helps.

No, there is no version of NAV in the public domain or as shareware.

Hi Greg,
 
I'm not sure that the problem is that you are having with VIRUSCAN and
CLEAN-UP but it sounds like the PC in question is becoming re-infected
after removal of the virus.  You may want to check any floppies in the
vicinity of the PC and see if they have the virus on them and are
re-introducing it.

In any case, if CLEAN-UP says that a virus cannot safely be removed from
the partition table, you have several options available to you other
then doing a low-level format.

1.	If you're so inclined, you can copy the partition table off of
	an identically partitioned hard disk and copy it over the PT of
	the infected hard disk. 

2.	If you have MS-DOS 5.00, you can run the DOS FDISK command with
	the /MBR option.  This is an undocumented switch in the FDISK
	command that replaces the Master Boot Record code (alias partition
	table) while leaving the data portion intact.

3.	Use a sector editor to change the last two bytes of the partition
	table, which are "55 AA" to anything else.  This will invalidate
	the partition table information, and you can then re-FDISK and
	FORMAT the disk.

Naturally, there is always a small amount of risk in doing any of this, so
it's always a good idea to make a backup of the hard disk before proceeding.

Another possibility is that you do not have the virus at all and instead are
experiencing a "ghost" effect, that is, when a fragment of viral code is left
at the end of a file somewhere on the disk that is loaded into memory with
the file and causes a false alarm.  This can be fixed by running a disk 
optimizing program to defragment the disk, or there's a program somwhere in
the simtel archives called COVERUP or COVERUP1 that will null-out the ends
of files.

BTW, I assume that you have tried using the latest (V85) version of
CLEAN-UP to remove the virus, both with the [JOSHI] and [GENP] ID
codes, as well as giving M-DISK a shot (if formatted with DOS 3-4).

Some of the names in the list are old and well-known viruses, such as

There are around 20 viruses which activate on Friday the 13th, such as
"South African" (which may not be South African at all), Jerusalem (with a
bunch of variants), Datacrime (well, sort of...), Relzfu (Fake-VirX),
Monxla, Leningrad and Omega.

Unfortunately the available information is not specific enough to determine
which virus is the cause in this case.

     For over a year now we have be discussing simple  techniques
for virus prevention - not 100% techniques but then stopping  the
spread does not require 100%, it is significantly less.

     Lately,  I  have come to realize that virus spread  is  best
modeled   using  a  diffusion-limited  aggregation  process  from
Fractal  Geometry:  infected  populations grow  in  clusters  and
larger  clusters  grow faster but slow again as they  approach  a
limit  imposed  by the envelope. While the math is  complex,  the
underlying  fact is not - if the clusters never exceed a  certain
size, epidemics do not occur.

     Consequently, I have focused my work not on 100%  prevention
with  the draconian measures that this would incur but a  gentler
process  that  provides  a near-certain likelihood  (I  have  not
mastered all of the math yet) of blocking viruses. With little or
no effect on the PC.

     Initially,  I decided to concentrate on the BIOS  viruses  -
those  infecting  the MBR (master boot record) and BR  (DOS  Boot
Record)  of hard disks. There were two reasons for  this:  First,
not  many  people  seemed to be working in  this  primeval  area.
Second,  the  rules  were simpler and I felt  that  it  would  be
possible  to  avoid  the Turing "halting"  difficulty  since  the
system at that point is rigorously defined.

     The   results  were  several:  DISKSECURE  was   the   first
technology demonstrator though its roots go back several years to
a  pair of programs designed to detect the Pakistani Brain  (also
see the "Six Byte" method). Observations made at that time led to
some DS principles.

     Of  course, the real problems came from  compatibility  with
all   of  the  diverse  systems  used  around  the  world,   only
discoverable  in practice. I wish to thank all of the V-L  people
who  provided feedback on what did not work that permitted me  to
accumulate a database of "compatibility requirements" - seventeen
bytes  in  one area that could not be depended on to  be  stable,
operating  systems that expected certain registers to  be  passed
intact, etc.

     In  comparison, a manufacturer who only has to  worry  about
his  current  hardware  and  software  has  it  easy.  I  have  a
tremendous  respect for all of the anti-virus vendors who  manage
to write programs that WORK. The marvel is not that they work  so
well,  the  marvel is that they work at all (paraphrased  from  a
quote  but  have  no idea whose). - No  wonder  most  third-party
FORMAT routines simply put code in the BR that says "This disk is
not Bootable".

     As is usual in later generations, I found that while DS  was
effective  in its purpose, less rigorous methods  would  suffice:
for  anti-virus  work. This led to the SafeMBR concept -  an  MBR
that  also did integrity checking using a special pair  of  rules
but did not have to go resident (unlike DS) to be effective. This
was  followed  by  NoFBoot,  a  small  TSR  designed  to  prevent
"accidents"  that  (IMHO) cause most MBR  infections.  The  final
step, CHKSMBR (a non-resident program included in FixMBR v  2.1),
simply verifies that SMBR has not been tampered with and  permits
Network authentication as well.

     This  complete "layered" system is IMHO capable of  knocking
out  the spread of all known MBR viruses (that account  for  over
50%  of  all  computer  virus  infections  -  data  from   McAfee
Associates  -  and all of the latest  round  of  "shrink-wrapped"
infections including the Dec. Novell incident).

     Of course, and again IMHO, where this technology belongs  is
in  the Operating Systems. It is trivial to  incorporate  SafeMBR
techniques  into FDISK and NoFBoot could easily  be  incorporated
into  either  the  hidden files  or  COMMAND.COM.  FixMBR  simply
demonstrates  a virus-aware repair capability easily included  in
FDISK  as  an  extension of the /MBR switch  in  5.0.  One  clone
manufacturer has shown an interest and I have seen an  indication
that Compaq may be working this area also (though how seriously I
have no idea) but thusfar that is the extent.

     In  any  event,  with the completion of  FixMBR  v  2.1,  my
feeling  is  that this study has gone far enough and  that  other
things  are more interesting (besides, over the holidays  I  came
close  to exhaustion and zero-free-time has been a fact  of  life
for too long now).

     Consequently, for the next while I plan to use what time  is
available  for  studying networks (I see the potential  for  some
serious   liabilities implicit in peer-peer networks that  cannot
require use of login scripts), Fractals, and putting my  Pontiacs
together.

                                        Warmly,
                                                  Padgett

Let's clarify I/O bound (input/output bound) and CPU bound.  These
terms refer to computers, not the programs.  They simply point out the
"weakest link" or "bottleneck".  An I/O bound computer means that it
is using all of its I/O resources to the maximum, but the CPU is often
idle.  CPU bound means that the CPU is processing at its maximum, but
there is plenty of unused DMA or I/O channels.  To improve the
performance of a CPU bound computer, one could buy a faster cpu (not
necessarily true for the I/O bound computer).

	last week with the goal of bringing users, vendors and researchers
	together to tackle virus attacks on networks in the private and
	government sectors.

	Dick Lefkon, associate professor at New York University and chair-

	Iceland.

Any typos are without a doubt mine!  (BTW, anyone have a list/whatever of
existing antivirus orgs? Just curious.)

Subject: Write protection - software

DEFMTH3.CVP   920105

                  Write protection - software

An aspect related to hardware damage is that of "write
protection".  Although this aspect of security is a part of
normal computer operation, the details are not necessarily well
understood by the general public.  In addition, certain
procedures related to write protection often recommended as
anti-viral measures are of little or no use.  They may, indeed,
be "dangerous", in that they encourage users to think themselves
safe and not to take further measures.

First of all, there is software write protection.  Many user
manuals for antiviral programs have suggested changing the file
attributes of all program files to "read-only" and "hidden".  A
minor problem with this is that a number of programs write to
themselves when making a change in configuration.  However, the
more major problem is that this action provides almost no real
protection.  What software (the operating system or protection
program) can do, software (a virus) can undo.  The overcoming of
this protection in MS-DOS is so trivially simple that utility
programs, asked to make a change to a protected program, simply
remind the user that the file is protected and ask for
permission to proceed.  (At least, the better written ones ask. 
Such is the contempt for "read-only" flags, that some programs
just "do it".)

There are, as well, programs which attempt to write protect the
hard disk as a whole, or individual files.  Since these programs
use methods other than the standard OS calls they are generally
more successful in protecting against "outside intrusion". 
However, I must again repeat that what software can prevent,
software can circumvent.

Software write protection must, of course, be running to do any
good.  Thus boot sector infectors, and any other viri which
manage to start up before the software protection is invoked,
have little to fear from these programs.  Some of the protection
programs start themselves as replacements for the master or
partition boot record, in order to get around such "early"
infectors.  However, in testing none have been able to prevent
infection by the ubiquitous "Stoned" virus.  (Regular readers of
the reviews will note the recent trial of one such hard disk
security program which not only did not prevent the infection,
but would not, thereafter, allow disinfection!  In my reviewing
I have come to be much more afraid of antiviral programs than of
viri themselves.)

(In talking of these PBR replacements, I must make an exception
for Padgett Peterson's excellent DISKSECURE, SAFEMBR and FIXMBR
programs.  This simple but elegant concept in system change
detection should be THE antiviral product of 1991.  Micro OS
vendors, are you listening?)
