I much enjoyed the Chronicle report.  But surely an easier piece of
first aid would be simply to reset the clock to March 8th before you
go home on the Thursday (5th), and then set it right on Monday?

(and of course take the backups.  ca va sans dire)

Subject: Michelangelo (2nd try) (PC)

We have seen a number of systems w/ the Michelangelo virus and have a
couple of observations and questions.

The McCafee CLEAN program annihlated the partition table on a 340 IDE
meg disk with 4 partitions when trying to clean the MichelanGelo
virus.  All the data and programs on the disk were lost.  oops.

The DOS 5 smartdrv program would not run on a system w/ Michelangelo.
This may be dependant on the other programs and device drivers
resideng, we didn't take time to sort this out.  A call to Microsoft
yielded the following suggestion: run "fdisk /Mbr"

I couldn't find this documented, but it seems to re-write the master
boot record.  After trying this on a couple of systems w/
Michelangelo, it seemed to eliminate the virus.  Any comments on
whether this is sufficient to eliminate the virus?

What is the potential for this to spread on a Novell network?  It
doesn't seem to be a big risk, but I don't want to find out March 6th
I was wrong.

Interesting... This virus was found here in Finland on September 1st
1991 and this is the very first time I've heard it has spreaded
outside Finland. One the other hand, this virus is becoming more and
more common here in Finland - during past few weeks I've received
reports only of it and Michelangelo.

F-Prot from Fridrik Skulason removes Cinderella just OK. BTW, did you
see a file named CINDEREL.LA anywhere? Cindrella should create such
file after certain number of keys have been pressed.

>	Here's the problem. Everytime i scanned it, it came out bad.

If you have Cinderella resident in memory, it'll infect files when you
execute or open them. Cinderella has a kind of bug in it which causes
it to infect files with 'wrong' extensions. The author of the virus
has probably tried to make it infect .COM files only, but it will
infect also files with .DOC and .CO extensions as well as some other
extensions too. Of course, virus can't spread via those non-executable
files.

Cinderella can't survive the warmboot. So, you must have an infected
program on your boot disk somewhere. Since you booted the computer
with that disk and copied COMMAND.COM to hard disk and COMMAND.COM
didn't get infected at that time, your scanner is most likely
infected.

Subject: Homegrown virus defense (PC)

     The question of us non-gurus using our own software has come up
 recently. I wrote some of my own a couple years ago, mostly to teach myself
 some techniques.  I learned lots, and having dabbled in it enough to feel
 well educated on the subject, I have a deeper respect for the _real_ virus
 protection software out there.  And I've found that it's worth the effort
 to investigate just what kind of protection each of the different packages
 gives.
     One justification I always had for going home-grown was that when it
 comes to virus protection, you're at the mercy of the author of the package
 you're using.  Only after some time reading these digests was I comfortable
 with that.  If there were some danger in using one of these package, there
 would be much noise about it here in this group. So I tend to recommend to
 others the shareware and freeware that gets discussed here, where I can
 watch for problems and fixes from authors and other users.  But up to now,
 I've used only my home grown stuff at home.
     With the onslaught of Michelangelo I have started to use _real_
 protection (and still use my own as an extra layer).  My own stuff was well
 done, but I would have been foolish to stick to it .
     My own program isn't real simple.  It attempts to defeat virus tampering
 with other files (to infect or to "go off"). It hooks BIOS disk service to
 enforce write protection for:
     1.   Critical regions of my hard disk (MBR, boot sectors, hidden area
          between MBR and first boot sector, etc.)
     2.   The boot sectors of all floppies
     3.   Specified files (from a prepared list), like COMMAND.COM, hidden
          system files, frequently run software, itself, etc.
     I guess that makes it similar to Ross Greenburg's old FLUSHOT software
 (superceded by VIRX?), but not as comprehensive (or friendly).  But it does
 a nice comprehensive protection (of file content, length, time stamp,
 attributes, FAT entries) and rarely warns me about dangerous, but intended,
 activity by other software.
     As proud as I am of my little package, it has a gaping hole.  An MBR
 virus will succeed in writing the MBR, since it acts before my protection
 software gets to load.  But won't feature #2 catch an MBR virus in the act
 of trying to infect its first floppy (after it has infected my hard drive)?
 No. (Exercise.)  And I might not have been able to see why not without
 reading what professional virus-fighters have to say.
     I have an MBR version that stealths the hard drive DOS partition(s)
 into existence at startup time, (so the hard drive looks non-DOS to a
 booting floppy) and a hard drive boot sector that checks for tampering with
 the MBR, but I don't even use that myself, for fear of the consequences of
 such a customized MBR and boot sector.  I now use FIXMBR to protect my MBR
 from unknown viruses.  That does not need to be upgraded (only packages
 that search for known viruses need frequent upgrades), and the replacement
 MBR is essentially a new standard, rather than my customized version.
     Virus fighting is extremely slippery business.  I do not have the
 expertise or the time to prepare proper defenses for my own machine. My own
 package has other applications (protecting files on multiple user hard
 disks), but I have become a believer in looking for virus protection in
 packages that I see many others talk about (and dissect), so that I have
 that safety in numbers, and cumulative expertise.  It's not just the gurus.
 It's also those who report the bugs and the "suspicious behavior" and ask
 the questions that they hope aren't stupid.

Subject: dir a: doesn't work (PC)

Help!

I frequently get unreliable results from dir a:

After a boot, the first floppy is read correctly.  If I insert a
floppy with different files, a dir still lists the files from the old
floppy.  This condition exists until I reboot.  My hard drive seems to
behave normally in all respects.

These symptoms have appeared on multiple machines that I use.

Does anyone know of a virus that causes this type of behavior and,
more importantly, how to get rid of it?

I'd appreciate any suggestions.

No - I've seen the AUX (as well as PRN, LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, COM1, COM2,
and NUL) on every system I've ever looked for them on - in every
directory too...  It's just the way DOS handles these reserved names as
files...  If a program needs to open a printer, you open "PRN", so it
has to be in the current directory (unlike UNIX with "/dev/lpr" & such).
They are not *REALLY* files, they just seem to be (try to "del prn" or
"edlin nul").

Acutally, I just figured something out...  My command processor is 4DOS.
If I execute command.com, I don't see these files.  In case you haven't
guessed, all of my systems use 4DOS, as do most of the systems at
work...

In our company of about 1000 PCs we have had good luck catching
Michelangelo with a combination of McAfee Scan and DOS CHKDSK.

The odds are that on March 6 some hard disks will be wiped.  Has
anyone done research to repair these disks to retrieve data?  Is it
even possible?

DON'T PANIC!

Meridian customers have nothing to worry about.  The disk that was
sent to the University of Alberta was not one of our standard release
disks from our manufacturing department.  It was a custom disk we
assembled in Technical Support, containing some obsolete Philips
MSCDEX drivers.  None of our regular products were affected.

We discovered the virus and have eliminated from our department.  The
manufacturing department uses isolated computers for software
preperation and makes regular virus checks.  Checks both before and
after the Alberta report showed that the manufacturing computers did
not have the virus.

The problem has been corrected with F-PROT 2.01; meanwhile 2.02 has been
issued, as you know.

In case of problems, it is always a good idea to check the latest version
of the respective software. With virus-specific software (e.g. virus
scanners), it is *absolutely essential* to always use the newest
release|

There are other aliases as well, like Anti-Tel, and Spanish Telecom.
In fact, this is a multi-partite virus, which releases a separately
and independently replicating boot sector virus, so it is better to
consider them as -two- different viruses...

Hmm, I have received other, independent reports about the same bug...
I cannot confirm whether it is still present in version 86-B. However,
I expect to receive an infected diskette, which is always destroyed by
CLEAN. As soon as this happens, a copy of will be forwarded to McAfee
associates.

Have you saved a copy of an infected diskette which will be destroyed
on disinfection? If yes, could you please check whether CLEAN 86-B
also destroys it? If it is so, post a warning as soon as possible and
send a sample to McAfee Associates.

Well, maybe until we receive confirmation (or denial) of this bug, it
is safer to use other disinfecting programs for this virus... F-Prot
is an excellent alternative. Also, a Michelangelo-specific remover
written by Chris Fisher (CARO member) can be found on our ftp site
(ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de, IP=134.100.4.42, directory
pub/virus/progs, file antimich.zip. The program is menu-oriented (with
windows, pull-down menus, bells and wistles), so I personally don't
like it, but I guess it does the job for the average user...

The name was changed to Copyright, because (1) a numeric name must be
avoided - it is difficult to remember and closely related virus
variants (i.e., viruses in the same family) can have different
infective length, and (2) because the virus contains the strings:

	"(C)1989 American Megatrends Inc."
	"(c)COPYRIGHT 1984, 1987 Award Software Inc."
	"ALL RIGHTS RESERVED"

An alternative was to call it "Award", or "Megatrends", but it's our
policy to never name a virus after a company or product.

Sorry to disappoint you, but CLEAN 86-B does not remove this virus.

I just got my new VIRx copy, and, just to check, scanned my computer.
Lo!  It found a copy of LibertyII in memory, and some other in cn*.exe
(spanish version of Norton Commander), and several copies of LHARC
with different manes. This happened also at my home computer.

The funny thing is that my home computer is set to fire CN at switch
on, and so, most of my executables should be infected. Why didn't
happen so? Maybe LibertyII is not particularly virulent, or it loves
some kind of files? May it be a bug in the program, that mistakes some
strings (found in the spanish version of NC) for a virus?

Anyways, I had other copy of LHARC, and it wasn't infected. Well,
that's all.  Thanx for any response.

You are perfectly right, there is something large in the memory of
your computer. It is called DR-DOS 5.0 and occupies roughly 70 Kb...
:-) Is it a virus? Well, according to Fred Cohen's definition - yes,
since it is able to infect other programs (e.g., with the SYS command
it installs on a hard disk or floppy, replacing a possible previous
version of itself (or of another DOS)... :-))

I'll follow this up, but what made the suggestion seem more feasible
was a response from the creator of LapLink during an interview about
his product.

The creator (whose name I do not have to hand) appeared to claim that
he could install his product onto a target machine WITHOUT requiring
an intervention by the operator of the target machine.  Previously
users were required to either manually install LapLink on a target
machine, or type in DOS commands so that the target machine would
allow control via the RS232 port.

No other details were given.  I'll look out the report (if I can
recall exactly where I read it) and post them for corroboration.

Subject: Re: Info requested on Stoned, Brain, Israeli (PC)

Dear VIRUS-L subscriber,

sorry for bothering you and all the other subscribers with this, when
only "RACARLTON@ACS.HARDING.EDU"@UALR.EDU is concerned.

In an attempt to being helpful, I mailed three files containing the
requested info on three viruses to the above address, but all I got
back was
> The message could not be delivered to:
> Addressee: "RACARLTON@ACS.HARDING.EDU"
> Reason:
>   %MAIL-E-USERSPEC, invalid user specification '@ACS.HARDING.EDU'
and much more in this vein.

If the person who reqeuseted this info in VIRUS-L is still interested,
he or she should drop me, privately, a line (or two) and I'll try to
re-submit to the address he or she will supply.

Regards,
                    Otto Stolz <RZOTTO@DKNKURZ1.Bitnet>
                               <RZOTTO@nyx.uni-konstanz.de>
