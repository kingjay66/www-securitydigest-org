A couple of weeks back Brian W. Gamble suggested providing custom BIOS
chips for PCs:

I think so.

You would require (semi-)custom equipment to track which BIOSes were
programmed, and to store the masters on hard disk, (master chips could
be borrowed or stolen to produce illegal copies).

This is probably the simplist part of the scheme, although collecting
all the data may have minor problems.

Okay, :-), here goes:

Most small PC manufacturers buy standard ROMs direct from AMI or
Phoenix, etc..  larger manufacturers buy in the code or produce their
own, again these are produced on ROMs.  Now we need to look at the
cost of this form of BIOS chip.  As I am not entirely upto date on
costs I'll use illustrative numbers for comparison only, don't quote
these as 'true costs', thank-you.

ROM form of BIOS costs:
$10 000  engineering costs for ROM mask (1 off per BIOS version)
$ 5 000  for a batch of 1000 ROMs, ie $5 each
$ 1 000  for automatic assembly of 1000 ROMs into circuit boards, ie $1 each

If a total of 1000 ROMs are used the cost each is $10+$5+$1 => $16
If a total of 10000 ROMs are used the cost each is $1+$5+$1 => $7

Your proposed custom BIOS system:
$ 3 000  for EPROM programming equipment, with audit of use and
         internal storage of masters, (1 per store)
$ 7 000  for static safe work benches, etc, for programming and installing BIOS
         chips with no risk of electro-static damage to components. (1/ store)
$10 000  for a batch of 1000 one-time-programmable (E)PROMs, ie $10 each
$    10  cost for employee to spend 15 minutes to help each customer select
         requirements, program the chips, install in the motherboard,
         close PC's case, (each)

If a total of 1000 ROMs are used the cost each is $3+$7+$10+$10 => $30
If a total of 10000 ROMs are used the cost each is $1+$10+$10 => $21

These costs look reasonable, but there are other costs. Firstly the
store would loose sales of other display products by giving space to
this service, which must be recouped.  Also the store will want to
market this as a 'premium' service, justifying a large mark-up on the
costs.  Not forgetting the increased costs in administering the
royalties, and wasteage of damaged parts.  And even the cost of the
technician isn't straight forward, specialist work is always charged
at a very high rate by companies - even when the 'specialist' is on
minimum wages.

Altogether you are likely to be charged over $150 for the service, and
breaking the system assembly into factory and shop stages is likely
reduce system reliability.

Here's a variation:
Install an extra bank of switches on new system boards, more technical
customers could then remove the PC case and alter the switches to
select the BIOS features desired.  A standard BIOS can then examine
the switches and enable special features or disable standard ones
accordingly.  This has few of the problems of your suggestion,
although it is a little inconvenient.  However, as only a small
proportion of users will want to vary from the default features the
supplier is likely to charge only an amount similar to requesting an
extra i/o card.  Mail order suppliers, both big brands like DELL and
the stores advertising in Computer Shopper, generally assemble PCs to
order and it would be trivial for them to set the BIOS configuration
for you.

I hope the above is constructive and helpful to you.

Yes, generally speaking we do fix any reported problems.  There are
obviously going to be certain times that we don't, for example, when a
user thinks one of the options should be a default, or one of the
defaults should be an option.  Of course, that example is not so much
a bug report as an enhancement request.  This is not to say that we
don't listen to requests for enhancements from users.  Case in point:
A network administrator had all sorts of drive assignments across his
LAN where every other user had different drive letters for their local
hard disks (if any were present).  He was having difficulty setting up
login scripts to test for the presence of each drive and then run SCAN
against them, so we added an option to interrogate the system and find
out which drivers were there, and scan them.  Or the /X switch, which
told SCAN to/not to (was changed several times) look for "extinct"
viruses.  Not very popular and was removed.  Or the guy up in Seattle
who wanted a 1" margin on the .DOC files so he could punch holes in
them and place them in a binder.  But I digress, getting back to your
message

Yes.  Those were all present in older versions of the VIRLIST.TXT.  As
the number of viruses (and variants) increased, it became more
difficult to maintain and inaccuracies would creep in.  However, with
V97 of the VIRLIST.TXT, we did a major update of the file (and
continued it with V99) which brings its level of accuracy back up to
par.  In the meantime, we're currently developing some new tools to
keep the VIRLIST.TXT file up-to-date.  If you do come across any
mistakes in it, please send email to my "aryeh@mcafee.COM" account and
I will forward it to the appropriate parties here so that it can be
fixed for the next release.

Of course you can't spend 10 minutes for each file to be examined, or
you'll never get a virus simply because....you'll never use your PC.

The number of viruses is increasing and scanners will become bigger
and slower, so you cannot spend all your time to scan your disks.

If you try other ways to detect Mte (my program does) then you must
put some restriction or you'll get a lot of false alarms.

Sure. But it's unreasonable to expect anti-virus software authors to
cater for grillions of different self-compression etc. utilities
because of the vague risk that a "baddy" might use one of these
grillions of "well-known" utilities to produce a harder-to-detect
vector for a well-known virus. Surely, in any case, the "baddy" who
wishes to o something along these lines will take the trouble to
produce the grillion-and-oneth self-compressor...

Subject: DOS virus in C-TOS Partion? (PC)

At work we have several Burroughs machines that have DOS partitions
and we access them with Virtual PC.  If we contract a DOS virus on the
Burroughs' DOS partition, will it also attack the C-TOS partition and
if so will it do the same thing as it would on a DOS machine.  I
realize this depends a lot on the virus itself.  Does anyone have any
information that would help me?

I would like to ask all those who belong to the second school of
thought: Will you really want to reply for virus protection on a
program that misses one infected file in every N? Especially if you
know that there are programs that -don't- miss any files infected by
this virus? If yes, then for what values of N? One infection missed in

That's what I am also afraid of; and that's why I am pushing for 100%

Don't change the wording. The article quoted him saying that he wants
his competitors to show worse results, not him to show better

Got it and did the tests. Will post the results, but in a separate

One important feature it lacks is to print the description of the
virus in an ASCII file. You can print it to the printer, but not in a
file. (Of course, this can be hacked out, but I would prefer to see
the feature included in a more natural way.)

Furthermore, the hypertext engine is in fact the one developed by
Flambeux Software (sp?) and distributed with their Tech Help!. This
allows to have just one hypertext engine resident and use both VSUM
and the Tech Help! database.

Why, it is still the most complete collection of descriptions of
MS-DOS viruses. I am complaining mainly because most of those
descriptions contain technical incorrectnesses... Often - significant
ones... :-(

That's true, we are working on the subject, but don't expect the
product to be ready soon. At first it will be probably just a
hypertext browser of the Computer Virus Catalog, which itself will be
kept in dBase format... But, as I said, it will not be ready soon.

I disagree.  For example, I just mentioned methods of fighting MtE
based viruses.  However, this group is more than likely read (and
maybe participated in ) by virus authors.  Telling them how you can
find or evade their creations will only help them make it harder for
AV researchers.
 
More intense discussion is often left to email.

No, I won't.  However, if you'd like, I'm sure that you can contact
William (Bill) McKiernan for a copy.  Bill can be reached at telephone
1-(408) 988-3609 or you can send a fax to him at 1-(408) 970-9727.
He's not on the Internet, but I do believe he has a CompuServe account
that you should be able to reach via the Internet.  I'll see if I can
find a user I.D. for him.  Bill currently serves as President and
Chief Operating Officer of McAfee Associates, Inc.  However, at that
time, he would have been acting in capacity as Vice-President of
Marketing.  I'm sure Bill would be happy to answer any questions about
press releases.

If by "mechanics" you mean policies and proceedures oriented towards
prevention, early detection, and containment, then I suggest you have
your newsfeed checked. I see a fair amount of this type of discussion
going on. (I also see 15-30 articles per day, which I don't consider
to be "silence".)

A basic tenent of this type of thing is to not let the "bad guys" know
just how their viruses are being detected. Once the detection method
is known, then a directed attack (as the Monkey virus reports recently
seem to qualify as) against the antiviri software becomes *much*
easier.

I, for one, don't care to see things made easier for Dark Avenger and
his cohorts. They are a festering sore on the computing community; I can
think of several suitable punishments (strand on a desert island with
no computers, network connections, pizza, or Jolt, for example) if they
ever are tracked down.

Certainly, the businesses who have suffered data loss and disruption of
work would have civil actions to pursue.

I'm not sure why you see a conspiracy of silence. I don't. I see a great
deal of intense programming effort being expended to counteract the 
malicious acts of a few. The people expending the effort are wisely not
posting the details of what they do, which slows the development of
viruses. (It also protects them from competitors, since most of these
people can't work for free.)

The level of activity I see is satisfactory to me. I don't know if there
could be much more discussion of the type you want to see without aiding
the virus writers.

A few points to ponder:

(a) I remember a *lengthy* discussion within the last year concerning
the Turing halting problem and whether it was theoretically possible
to detect all virii on a finite-sized machine.

(b) There's a lot of different virus critters out there, and tweaking
scan codes needs to be done.

(c) I think the "techniques and ideas" is for the most part fairly
well understood by most of the "power players" in the field.  There
*are* after all only a finite number of effective ways to write a 
virus - boot sector, .EXE infiltrator, etc.

(d) A certain amount of discretion *does* need to be used when dealing
with security-related issues.  I've found security problems in a number
of different vendor's products, and there is *always* the problem of
trying to decide how to tell "enough" of the hole so that people are
convinced that there is a problem, but *not* so much that every hacker
in the world can exploit it before there is a patch available.  Do you
*want* somebody to post "Hey World - if you put the hex string
x'AEDF12E7' in a virus, no known virus checker will see it?"

(e) You say you don't see "a discussion of the mechanics of fighting viruses", 
but then say there's too much discussion of scan codes and all.  Isn't
this in fact 'the mechanics' of it?  I'm not sure what exactly you DO
want to see more of in this newsgroup.

Subject: CHRISTMA Data (CVP)

Having had now three responses to the first two postings on the
CHRISTMA worm (and having still four more "in the can" ready to go), I
feel some need to respond.  Not that I think I am being flamed and
need to defend myself: quite the contrary, i am extremely thankful for
the additional information and correction.  I do, however, feel that I
should make some attempt to regather the tattered shreds of my
credibility before I lose it entirely.

When I started into the "history" section of the CVP series, I made a
very bad mistake in failing to thoroughly research my original source
materials for the Jerusalem virus.  having learned from that mistake,
I hope my subsequent columns have demonstrated better research.
CHRISTMA, however, seems to have had significant errors in the
reporting, which was extensive.  (My "research" file on CHRISTMA alone
runs to slightly under 200K.)  Bridget, for example, states that
CHRISTMA did not clean itself up.  She must know, since she had to
clean up the remaining files.  However, numerous reports state that
once CHRISTMA had mailed itself off, the "original" message deleted
itself.

David Chess is concerned that I am spreading an urban with in stating
that VNET had to be shut down.  I'd be concerned, too, and I apologize
if I am spreading falsehoods that way.  I must admit, that, aside from
one newswire report, which I wouldn't trust by itself, my "source
material" for this is only one message, albeit an otherwise accurate
and authoritative message which, despite broad circulation, was never
(to my knowledge) publicly refuted.

I suppose that this is part of the reason that I write the column.  I
hope that "neophytes" derive some information and background from it
that is helpful.  However, I hope that I am also choosing "important"
events in "viral computing", and I hope that those with direct
experience of some of these issues will continue to correct errors
that I may let slip by.

Anyhow, enough whining and self-justification.  On with the regularly
scheduled column.

HISVIRJ.CVP   921022
 
                           CHRISTMA Data
 
Once again, the CHRISTMA EXEC demonstrates a virus (or, more exactly,
a worm) in an area that is generally thought to belong to data.
Although IBM mainframe systems can use mail to transfer files (mail
is, in fact, simply a specialized case of file transfer), the CHRISTMA
message was contained in text.  REXX source code, to be exact.
 
It is often said, when answering the frequent question about whether a
virus can be transmitted via a data file or a message, that the line
between data and programming is very blurred.  This is quite true.  In
fact the MAKEBOO program, a utility for converting binary files into
printable characters, suitable for transmitting across email systems,
itself contains only printable characters.  The MAKEBOO program, then,
can be sent, as a message, over normal email systems.  (Those wishing
a copy of MAKEBOO, please get it from SIMTEL or some other site.  I
*cannot* function as a fileserver.)
 
The CHRISTMA EXEC, however, was not a program in this sense.  An EXEC
is a source code program, which is then run by an interpreter.  REXX
is, then, an interpreted, rather than a compiled language, much the
same as most BASIC interpreters.  No object code is ever produced in
this kind of situation.  In that case, what is the source code?  A
program to be run, or a data file to be edited?  The answer, of
course, is both.
 
Interpreters are making a resurgence.  While interpreted programs are
much slower than compiled ones, modern computers are fast enough to
deal with the speed problem.  In addition, interpreted languages allow
the programs to be run on multiple platforms without object code
compatibility problems.  There is no need to adjust, or even
recompile, the code.  Simply run what you are given.  REXX
interpreters are available on a wide variety of platforms.  Many other
similar languages are available.
 
Indeed, application programs are tending to become such interpreters.
"Programs" are being written in 1-2-3 and Word Perfect.  Terminal
emulators, as well, have "scripting" languages that are being used to
automate any function that users might have the slightest difficulty
with.
 
"Groupware" is this year's buzz word.  Groupware will rely heavily on
the configuring, automating and presentation of functions through
exactly these kind of systems.  "Open systems" and cross platform
compatibility, both desperately desired by users and corporations,
will also present opportunities to the authors of viral programs.

Hello, everybody!

Here is the long awaited report about the MtE detection tests that we
performed at VTC-Hamburg.  It is rather longish, so maybe Ken should
consider splitting it into parts.  Normally, I should have put it for
anonymous ftp, instead of publishing it here, but the preliminary
results of the tests raised enough interest and discussions, so I
decided to publish it in a whole in this newsgroup.  Nevertheless, it
- - -is- available for anonymous ftp as

ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de:pub/virus/texts/tests/mtetests.zip

[Moderator's note: The complete text of Vesselin's MtE tests are also
available from:
      cert.org:pub/virus-l/docs/mtetests.zip 
As I had previously indicated, I have broken Vesselin's tests down
into five parts and will post each seperately.]

Enjoy.  Comments, questions, and suggestions are welcome.

4. The results.

For each scanner we give the number of samples that it has detected,
the total number of samples, and the number of missed samples. The
notation used is "Detected/Total/Missed". Obviously,
Total - Detected = Missed. When Detected == Total, we also give the
results of the additional tests, using the same notation, on the next
line, but only if they show that the scanner does NOT detect that
particular virus reliably.

Comments:

1) This is German-only product.  As far as I know, no English version

2) Obviously, the algorithm for MtE detection contains a bug, which
prevents it from detecting the MtE in EXE files. Otherwise the
algorithm seems reliable. Let's hope that the bug will be corrected
soon.

2) When run in command-line mode, the program refused to create a log
file, regardless that it was instructed to do so.

Comments:

1) During the additional tests, one file caused CPAV to hang while
testing it. A file should be either detected as infected, or not, but
by no means should the program crash when scanning it.

2) CPAV insisted to broadcast warnings about the  found infections on
the network, which was particularly boring. It's an useful feature,
but there should be a way to turn it off.

3) The tests of this scanner were done by Mattias Jaenichen.

Comments:

1) The program is horribly buggy. It crashes when the total
environament is more than 256 bytes, there are missing virus
descriptions in the help, parts of the user interface are not designed
well enough, and many other things.

2) The algorithm for MtE detection, however, seems to be excellent,
except for the CryptLab virus, which the author of the program seems
not to have.

3) This was the only program that properly identified each one of the
samples. The other scanners just said "MtE virus" or something
similar. This program even used the standard CARO notation! (E.g.,
"MtE_0_90.CoffeeShop".)

Comments:

1) All missed samples are unencrypted (although not all unencrypted
samples are missed). The author of the product is strongly advised to
put a scan string of the body of the MtE in his dabase of scan
signatures and to let the AVR module to detect only the encrypted
samples of the virus.

Comments:

1) NAV 2.1 is hopeless in detecting the MtE-based viruses.

2) When run in interactive mode, NAV stopped after a few hundred
infections were found, and nicely told me to remove some of the
infected files and to try again. The reason is that it tries to keep
the whole report in memory - something extremely stupid.

3) When run in interactive more, I couldn't force it to create a
report file.

Comments:

1) The results are the same as HTSCAN, because the same AVR module is
used.

2) Most of the unencrypted samples missed by the AVR module are
detected by TBSCAN's heuristics and are reported as "unknown viruses".
However, 33 samples of Fear were missed even by the heuristics.

3) It is NOT possible to turn the heuristics off completely,
regardless what the documentation says.  The -expertlog option only
suppresses the (longish) explanation of each heuristic; it doesn't
prevent the heuristics from working.  Therefore, it is not possible to
test only the capabilities of the signature database and the AVR
modules to detect viruses.  I find this rather annoying.

Comments:

1) UTSCAN is only the scanner part of a package, which is
integrity-oriented. Nevertheless, its MtE-detection algorithm seems
rather good. Let's hope that the problem with the Groove virus will be
fixed soon.

Comments:

1) VIRX is yet another program that commits the stupidity to keep the
whole report file in memory. Of course, after a few hundred infections
the memory gets filled up. Then, the program does something even more
stupid - it  begins to stop after EACH new infection, to inform the
user that there is no memory for the report file, and to wait for a
keypress. The only reason I was able to test it at all, was that it
can append the results of several scans to one and the same report
file, and that 4DOS supports an advanced syntax of the FOR loop, which
permitted me to traverse only the directories infected by a particular
virus, one at a time.

Comments:

1) The author of the program claims that it is able to detect only
encrypted replicants of the MtE-based viruses. Of the unencrypted
replicants, only those are detected, that represent viruses known to
the author. No attempt is made to detect unencrypted unknown MtE-based
viruses. The tests showed that it is indeed so - all missed samples
were unencrypted (although not all unencrypted samples were missed).
The author is encouraged to contact us, in order to obtain samples of
the MtE-based viruses that are unknown to him.
