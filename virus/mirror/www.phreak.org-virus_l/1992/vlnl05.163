Subject: Is this a virus problem?? (PC)

Is there a virus out that can cause a computer not to boot when I/O
ports are installed?  Mine will not boot when I try it with an I/O
card installed. (tried 3 cards, so chances are it is not the card).

THe reason I think it could possible be a virus is that when it does
actually boot (with no I/O) it does virus-like things such as:
completely hanging for no apparent reason, incorrect dir listings of
a,b drives, repeating commands for no reason.

Can a virus actually do this?

I tried Norton antivirus with no success and also an 
older version of SCAN which found nothing.

So, could this be a virus or should I take the computer
in for a tune-up????

THanks,

Subject: Virus alert: "Larry on a Screen" (PC) 

A virus has shown up in Tasmania, Australia, which we haven't seen
reported before, and which isn't known by name to F-Prot 205 or TBScan
43 (although they both pick it up by heuristics).

We have only analysed it far enough to get its name and an ID string;
we don't know potential damage.

Name: Larry on a Screen
Infects: .EXE & .COM files (at least)
.COM files seem to grow by 491 bytes, .EXE files by a varying amount
( we saw 403 & 507 bytes ).

Signature strings: "Larry on a Screen"
Hex: "50cbbf00018b750181c6d90257b90500fcf3a481"

I have been trying to get VCL to operate on my system, and I think the
authors don't know how to write compatible code.  Does anyone know how
to get it to work on a 286 with a black and white screen (HGA)?  Or do
the virus creation lab people only design their VCL for those with
lots of money?  I suppose it's only for elite virus writers, and not
for the rest of us.

The EXEbug virus (seemingly written in South Africa and now very, very
widespread here) has, as one of its most noticeable giveaways, the
side effect that floppies can't be formatted on a infected machine.
EXEbug's stealth replaces the INT 13 Format call with a
Do-Nothing-But-Say-You-Did call to "protect" the boot sector of discs.
So, when FORMAT verifies Track 0 (as it does, because of its
importance, thanks to the DOS floppy layout) it gets somewhat upset to
see that the boot sector didn't actually get succesfully formatted!
Result: "Track 0 is bad - diskette unusable". This side-effect will,
however, be observed on discs of all capacities.  Floppy disc drive
salesmen are having a great time right now, especially if they get to
keep the "failed" drive they're replacing :-)

A virus which doesn't affect (infect?) 1.44M discs and which prevents
720K discs from being read (ie: used..) would seem to be a seriously
brain-damaged virus indeed..

Subject: BIOS functionality at bootup (was the C: the A: saga..) (PC)

The trend amongst BIOS manufacturers to provide a CMOS-configurable
option to allow you to inhibit bootup from floppy disc has been rather
staunchly raved about of late in comp.virus. Yet Boot Sector viruses
continue unabated.

Unfortunately, the interface which allows you to select the BIOS bootup 
mode usually lets you choose, during CMOS setup, between "Boot sequence 
C: A:" and "Boot Sequence A: C:". Once you've chosen, you get no feedback 
during subsequent bootups to remind you of the configuration. If you go 
back to the "A: C:" sequence in order to let yourself boot from floppy, 
you need to remember to reselect "C: A:" next time.

Much better would be, when in "A: C:" mode, for the BIOS to ask for
confirmation before booting from A:. This would serve three purposes:
firstly, to remind you to switch back to "C: A:" mode; secondly, to
avoid accidental floppy bootup and, lastly, to assure you that any
bootup from floppy disc really was originated by the BIOS. A virus like
EXEbug boots from floppy by a devious route -- it alters the CMOS setup
to force bootup from your hard disc and then, after loading itself from
the hard drive into memory, switches over to boot from floppy if you
have one inserted. This means that what seems to be a clean boot is
actually no such thing! If the BIOS were to ask for confirmation before
initiating a floppy bootup, the subterfuge of viruses like EXEbug would
be obvious.

BIOS manufacturers, what say ye?

I would think that the program wrote the Michelangelo virus strings to
the partition table. Try running F-PROT on the file. It will detect
Boot sector/Partition table viruses even if they are not in their
respective places.  (e.g. in an image file) Don't erase the file; send
it to MCAFEE assosiates (makers of SCAN) or Fridrik Skulason (F-PROT).

Well, it is an interesting question.  Assuming the virus has been
accurately identified, there are several possible answers.

   1) The virus can never be disinfected - this is true for overwriting
      viruses.

   2) The virus can be removed, but the resulting program will not be 100%
      identical to the original.  For example, it may have grown by 1-15 bytes
      or a non-critical field in the EXE header may be changed (the checksum
      field, for example)

   3) The virus can usually be removed, but it may damage some programs, and
      that damage may not be detectable.  Jerusalem, for example.

   4) The virus can be removed, and the resulting program will be identical
      to the original one.

Subject: Virus Scanner Reviews (PC)

There were two reviews published in British computer magazines this
month.  One (in PCW) was badly done - in fact, my opinion is that they
should officially apologize next month.

They used an incredibly small set of virus samples, modified the
infectedd programs in order to disable the viruses, and checked which
programs were still able to detect the viruses.  When they discovered
that some of the anti-virus programs did not detect some of the
viruses, they considered this highly significant and an indication
that the programs were not protecting the users.  My program was not
included in that review, so I don't have any reasons to be upset,
but.....

The other review (in PC Direct) is surprisingly well done - I am
personally quite satisfied with my outcome there, but according to
that review some of the anti-virus programs on the market are,
well...not quite as good as they should be, to say the least. In one
case the review starts like this:

     It is rare to find a program as bad as ....... The poor impressions
     started on opening the box, to reveal the software on two write-enabled
     disks. We write-protected them before installation, but the install
     procedure wanted us to remove the write protection to enable any viruses
     found to be cured.
     ...
     The program is incredibly tedious to use, requiring several keypresses
     between each disk or virus and there is no option to produce a printed
     report
     ...
     The monitor claimed to have detected a virus every time we loaded
     Windows 3.1
     ...
     The distributors offer unlimited free upgrades via BBS...We called the
     bulletin board: this turned out to be the "The Dog and Disk BBS" and we
     were greeted with the information that "Richard was in the bar"

Now, I usually don't like to say bad thing about my competition :-)
but in this case I just could not resist...

Subject: Information about Brasil virus (PC)

I have obtained a copy of the "Brasil virus" and partially
disassembled it.  Here follows the results:

This analysis is based upon the virus sectors found in a 360k
diskette, forwarded by Joseph Max Cohenca <mcohenca@uspif.if.usp.br>,
from University of Sao Paulo, Brazil.

1. The virus is not detected by any anti-virus software available now
(5th October 1992). F-Prot 2.05 doesn't detect it, neither in "secure
mode" nor in "quick mode" nor in "heuristic mode". Scan v95b detects a
"Generic Boot Infector", but this is just a warning saying that SCAN
did not discover the normal DOS boot code in the disk.

2. The virus is a bootstrap virus, and seems to be a new one; either
it is an original Brazilian virus, or it is a very modified copy from
some existing virus (like Stoned or Michelangelo).

3. The virus occupies three sectors of a disk. The first sector, that
substitutes the boot in diskettes, or the master boot in hard disks,
contains the initial activation code of the virus, which is executed
when the machine is powered up or rebooted. The second sector
contains the virus code that becomes memory resident, and that is
responsible for propagating the virus. In the third sector the virus
stores the original boot sector.

4. In hard disks the virus uses for his three sectors the sectors 1, 2
and 3 of cylinder zero, head zero. To eliminate this virus, sector 3
(the original master boot) should to be copied back into sector 1.

5. In 360k diskettes the virus uses DOS sectors 0, 10 and 11 (this
means sector 1, cyl. 0, track 0 (boot), sec 2 cyl 0 tr. 1 (sector 10
and sect 3 cyl 0 tr. 1 (sector 11)). Sectors 10 and 11 are the end
sectors of the root directory, and the virus may overwrite directory
information during the infection process. To eliminate the virus
sector 11 into should be copied back into sector 0.

6. The virus handles correctly other diskette types (720k, 1.2M and
1.44M), hiding his three sector always in the boot sector and in the
last two directory sectors.

7. The virus test his own presence through the addresses hex 01A8 and
01A9 of the boot sector. If these two bytes are CF CF, the virus
assumes it already infected the disk. If not, it then proceeds to
infect the disk.

8. The virus intercepts only interrupt 13H (Bios Disk services).

9. The virus uses stealth techniques to avoid his detection. Any read
access to the boot sector is redirected to the sector where the virus
stored the original boot sector.

10. During his attack, the virus writes "Brasil virus!" at the current
cursor position at screen. This text ("Brasil virus!") is stored
scrambled in the second virus sector.

11. The virus infects only diskettes in drive A:., during read
 operations. A single "Dir" command is enough to infect a diskette.

12. In order to trigger his attack, the virus sets a counter when it
infects a hard disk. This counter is decremented after each
 hour that the computer is in operation.  After 120 hours of
effective use, the virus writes his message ("Brasil virus!"),
writes random data in the first 50 cylinders of the hard disk
and the "freezes" the computer. Obs: This "trigger routine"
 needs further investigation. I haven't disassembled it completely.


A specific program to detect and eliminate the "Brasil virus" was
written in the Informatics Institute of the Federal University of Rio
Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Porto Alegre, Brazil. It is available through
anonymous ftp from the site caracol.inf.ufrgs.br (143.54.2.99),
directory pub/virus/pc, file antibras.zip.

Subject: Could FORM infect OS/2's BOOT.DOS file (OS/2)

A colleague has a PC which can dual boot to either DOS or OS/2. Both
Jim Bates's VISCAN and F-PROT v2.05 report that the file BOOT.DOS in
C:\OS2\SYSTEM contains a FORM image. After booting from a clean floppy
the size of BOOT.DOS reported by a dir is 512 bytes and the date/time
stamp is similar to that of other files in the directory (I know
viruses can fiddle this). The usual FORM message is not in the file.
My colleague says (I haven't had time to check this) that she cannot
find BOOT.DOS on any of the original OS/2 disks. On the hard disk it
is hidden/readonly.  Could any of the experts say whether this is a
real infection and if so how to recover from it. We have had
infestations of FORM on both floppy disks and DOS-only hard disks.

   Looking at the "review", you barely read our response :-) BTW, the
name is Tarkan, sir, not Tarken. As far as a lengthy response goes, I
will not waste bandwidth since the stuff you posted does not seem to
be about VDS.  Worse yet, it omits major features of the package and
it does not even mention how it handled a common virus infection.
Considering that no criteria is given in any of your evaluations, we
have to say that there is no context in which some of your comments
make sense. We think that the main principle of reporting performance
evaluations should be reproducibility. Please share with us and the
rest of your readers how you go about testing products. We have the
impression that your "methods" are ad hoc and cannot be taken
seriously. Hope we are mistaken.

   The sad part is that you are giving your readers an incomplete picture.
Reviewing an integrity package is not the easiest thing to do, compared to
the simplicity of scanner zoo-testing; and to some extent, gross
inaccuracies in your posting are understandable.

   Individuals who wish to look at VDS can do so by downloading a copy
of the trial version (fully functional with a few features missing) from
many FTP sites, including Simtel-20 and its mirrors. And if anyone finds
that the F1 key does not do anything perceptible as you say, we would
like to hear :-)

   VDS is a very comprehensive package with carefully selected components.
The documentation may not do justice to each one; however, calling it
flippant or containing little substantive material is ludicrous. And if it
maintains a sense of humor at certain points, that is for those who can
appreciate such an approach. It is readable, unlike many others you would
see.
   In the light of what you call a "review", I cannot help but quote a
sentence from our "flippant" documentation:

  "... Similarly, some product reviewers get their stopwatches and virus
  samples ready and babble the same old rhetoric about the numerous (but
  irrelevant) features of these anti-viral programs. This situation hurts
  the end-users in a non-obvious way: it adds to the existing confusion
  about what the problem is and what a good solution should entail."

                                        VDS 2.10 documentation, page 3

   Have a nice day of virus-free computing!


P.S.: VDS Pro 1.0 is in beta-test phase, and it should be available in a
      few weeks. Interested individuals can send me e-mail and I will try
      to answer any questions as my time permits.

Hey, Vesselin (and anyone else with enough suss to count, myself
[ahem] included..) has been saying this to anyone who'll listen (and
many who won't) for ages. I've never seen him suggest anything *but*
the deletion of infected files, in fact..

BTW: "reinstalling" infected binaries can indeed be painful these
days. It's no longer a question of copying .EXEs from original
floppies onto your HDD. We're seeing increasingly cryptic distribution
discs, with custom compression and no easy way to pull off a single
binary.  Once you've got a clean installation of a whopper-app (try
BC++ 3.1 with Application Framework if you're keen on ___big___) with
things set up how you like, try making an "as installed" copy to tape.
Could save you a lot of frustration if someone deletes one or two of
those seemingly redundant configuration/setup/hey-what's-this files..

Not quite sure what this means -- especially since the partition table
is not part of the BIOS [or is there a version of FDISK out there
which can remask ROMs while they're in use :-)]. Assuming that the
second "BIOS" should read "HDD", then so what? Most MBR viruses leave
the partition table intact, altering only the *code* zone of the MBR,
so an integrity check of the partition table at BIOS level will show
nothing wrong. Lastly, if "partition table" should read "MBR" (ie:
code+table), then what constitutes "valid"? There are lots of "valid"
partition record boot loaders out there -- the FDISK one, Coherent's
multiboot one, XYZ Corp's multiconfig one, etc. Seems like defining
"valid" partition record boot loader might be a bit tricky, and even
trickier to implement an algorithm to perform the "validation"...

Vesselin is right, in fact. Tequila requires a hard drive. It doesn't
go resident when you run an infected file -- it merely "primes" the
MBR to load the virus next time you boot up from hard disc. No HDD, no
Tequila in memory..

Still, T.Tequila's gamble that you've got a hard drive on your PC is a
relatively safe one :-)

As we leave the "first generation" of PC programmers, this is
becomming more and more evident. Lately the amount of *bad* code from
major manufacturers is increasing, not deacreasing.

One example is the rising number of "do-it-all" packages that do not
seem to know how to handle removable drives. First it was NAV and NDW
that would get upset if I did not have a disk in my Bernoulli drive,
now we can add Addstor's "SuperStor Pro" Windows element to that list.

In another example of "someone who should know better", I saw the use
of 286 instructions in a program for "all PCs". Wonder what compiler
they were using ?

The most recent is the discovery that a particular MBR error will
render a system unbootable from floppy with MS-DOS 5.0 (and 6.0 beta).
You can still use 4.01 & earlier but then will not be able to use
FDSIK /MBR. (Booting from a lower DOS and expert use of DEBUG can
restore everything though).

Saw this in a security product that touted prevention of floppy boots
- - guess the author was not aware of earlier DOS versions 8*(

In short, lately there seems to be a regrettable decline in the
quality of the gigantic software packages reaching the market today.
More disturbingly, often when I call to report such bugs, the only
person reachable obviously has no idea what I am talking about and has
no inclination (possibly by direction) to pass me on to anyone who
does.

Must admit that often I'll call the publicised numbers just to find
out what will happen to Joe Public. Recently was on hold for 45
minutes (luckily I had a good book) only to finally reach a security
operative - tech support went home 15 minutes earlier. One I enjoyed
the most was a recording announcing that I had reached TS "after
hours" and being advised to call back "between 9 am and 4 pm PST,
Mon-Thurs". It was.

On the plus side, the quality of hardware seems to be improving.
BIOSes are now allowing not only boot selection but providing password
protection (would like to think that this is a result of our
prodding). In the last week I have seen notice of disk controllers
with hardware implimentation of disk compression built in and a single
chip AT-Ethernet interface.

Have just upgraded to a Maxtor 7213A disk in my "big" PC. Called to
ask about documentation. Two days later a thirty page tech document
arrived telling me not only everything about the drive but also quite
a bit about IDE drives in general (also available in SCSI). With a
street price of under US2.00/MB and dropping, this may be the new
standard (will have to see if the logetivity will match my MK-1 ST-412
10 MB drive that was my telephone stand for a few years before its
current compressed use in an 286 based answering/fax machine).

IMHO networks are going to be what will slow/stop the spread of common
viruses since they do not have to be subject to the "Turing halting
problem".  However, this applies only to a true client/server network
exhibiting dual state operation (client-server) and state isolation,
*no* peer-peer network that I have seen need apply since they are all
collections of single state machines.

Unfortunately, this condition "just happened" and I have seen little
interest by the manufacturers (with the possible exception of Novell)
in making this a central strategy. We can hope.

In the Von Neumann architecture, the program is a state machine, and the
data is the ticker-tape (or dual stack).  They are distinct entities,
and no definition is made on where they lay in storage.

In today's the Von Neumann computers, the actual "program" state-machine
is embodied in the hardware of the computer, while the "data" consists
of microcode, the OS, and application programs, as well as the data they
require.

Modern computers also emulate Babbage machines; there is generally some
ROM code in them that is unalterable by viruses.

It's very hard these days to make a distinction between program and data
on an arbitrary level of abstraction.

Robert Kolker asks:

Good question!  I guess the answer depends on whether that seperate
memory space is protected or not.  If the separate memory space is
write-protected, for example, imagine a program which resides on a
protected network drive, it is both external to the system, and
protected and is protected from virus infection from all users (with
the exception of administrators).  Now, if this program is not on a
protected memory device, or if it is copied to a non-protected memory
device, then it can be infected.  In the case where it is copied, the
original remains un-infected, but the new copy on the non-write
protected memory device would be infected.  I hope this answers the
question.  :-)

Andy Hardison asks:
(I will paraphrase for the same of brevity) A bbs user he has claims
to have run a program from his bbs which caused Michelangelo to infect
his disk. How could this happen?

Again, good question.  The only way this could have happened is that
the program in question would have to be a "dropper" program.  Dropper
programs are programs used to place other virus programs onto the boot
sector of a disk or into a host program (for executables).  While this
is possible, I would think that getting hold of such a program for
Michelangelo would be unlikely.  If you have the file, dis-assemble it
and see for sure.  It is more likely that your user did himself in by
infecting himself with the Michelangelo virus, and he is looking for a
scapegoat.  A good disassembly of the code would remove all doubt.
Since the Michelangelo is an MBR and boot-sector infector only, it can
neither be spread by a program being copied down from a bbs (unless it
IS a dropper), nor can it spread via a network.

Subject: MacMag, the commercial virus (CVP)

HISVIRE.CVP   920905
 
                   MacMag virus - Commercialism
 
Surely the most renowned aspect of the MacMag/Brandow/DREW/
Compuserve/Macinvirus virus was that it holds the dubious
distinction of having been the first virus to infect commercial
software.
 
The president of a company producing educational material for
computer training visited Canada.  He was given a copy of the "Mr.
Potatohead" program.  (At a party, by one report.)  It was infected.
 
At home, he ran the program.  Once.  In his office.  Thus infecting
his computer.
 
The training company, MacroMind, some time later delivered some
training software to Aldus Corporation.  Aldus was, at that time,
preparing the release of its then new "Freehand" drawing product. 
Computers at Aldus were infected with the virus, and it eventually
spread to the production copy of the Freehand program.  Three days
production of the program were infected (by one report 7,000 copies,
by another 10,000).  An unknown, but fairly large number had already
been distributed by the time the infection was discovered.
 
At the time, MacroMind's customers included Microsoft, Lotus Apple
and Ashton-Tate.  Ashton-Tate consistently refused comment, the
others all, at various times, denied any infection, and none was
ever found coming out of those companies.
 
(Some other historical notes.  
 
John Markoff, with far less accuracy than he has shown of late,
reported that the virus was a product of the "Cult of the Sub-
Genius".  He also reported some amazingly inaccurate information
about the Sub-Genii themselves.  
 
We also have, in some of the reports of the virus, the first of what
has come to be standard in media reports of viral programs, the
warning to avoid shareware and only use commercial software.  Very
interesting that this particular canard should have started with
this particular virus.)
 
With the furor from the Compuserve reports, and the media attention
to the Aldus infection, it is unlikely that the virus was every
triggered other than by those who wanted to see the display.
