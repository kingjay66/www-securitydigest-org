Review: A Pathology of Computer Viruses

VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  (The complete set of posting guidelines is available by
FTP on cert.sei.cmu.edu or upon request.)  Please sign submissions
with your real name.  Send contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU
(that's equivalent to VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).
Information on accessing anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue
archives is distributed periodically on the list.  Administrative mail
(comments, suggestions, and so forth) should be sent to me at:
krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: Volume 5 is here

Happy New Year, everyone.  Now that 1992 is here, VIRUS-L is now up to
Volume 5.  I'd like to thank all of you who took the time to send me
suggestions for improving the group - which isn't to say that I
wouldn't welcome any more suggestions.  I still have to get back to a
few of you regarding your suggestions, and I'll do that shortly.

Many of the suggestions which I received were excellent.  I'll be
incorporating a few immediately, and a few more as time permits.  A
couple of common themes were digest and archive organization, so I
want to give those items attention as quickly as possible.

First, all new digests archived on cert.sei.cmu.edu will be of the
filename format: v#i###, starting with v5i001.  In the past, I didn't
use any preceeding zeros in the filenames; this will make it easier to
get alphabetical directory listings.

Also, I'm going to start working on a better organizational structure
for the digests.  One suggestion was to use more descriptive subject
designators such as (PC) (question), (PC) (ALERT), etc.  I'd like to
hear what people think about that.  In the meantime, I'll be trying to
separate the postings by subject matter in the following order:

Alerts and administrative announcements
PC topics
Mac topics
General topics
File archive updates
Reviews & informative docs

Meanwhile, progress on a FAQ continues.  A number of folks sent in
suggestions for the document, and some even volunteered to help.
(Thanks!)  What I'm specifically looking for is submissions of
questions and answers, and I am collating the submissions into the FAQ
itself.  I expect the FAQ to be an ever-changing document, as
questions appear and change with time, so please send in your
submissions whenever you feel that something is appropriate for the
FAQ.  (For those of you just tuning in, FAQ stands for Frequently
Asked Questions.)

Finally, I've received updated copies of Anthony Appleyard's VIRUS-L
digest index files for Volume 4, and I'll be putting these on the
archive shortly.

Keep those suggestions and FAQ submissions coming, please!

Subject: Michelangelo virus on Zyxel disk (PC)

Hello world,

I've just become the proud owner of a Zyxel U-1924E modem (hurray!),
but found the Michelangelo virus on the disk I got with it (boo!).
The disk was not write-protected and the envelope it came in was open,
so I cant say for sure whether it was Zyxel or the distributor.
Normally one would not boot from this disk, so this is not a very
serious problem. For me it is a novelty, though. In all these years of
dealing with viruses, I have never before got one myself by accident.

Cheers, Morton
and seasons's greetings for all those who are still to celebrate.

Subject: Does this behavior sound like a virus (PC)

The other day I inserted a floppy into the A: drive on my pc and tried
to do a dir.  I got the message back stating "Sector not found" and it
was unable to read the disk.  After trying several other disks, I
figured my drive had bit the dust so I put in another.  However, this
drive exhibited the same behavior.

I tried booting off a a floppy instead of the hard drive and was able
to read other floppies fine, with and without write protect tabs.
However, after some experimenting, I discovered that if I booted off
the hard drive I could read floppies as long as they had the write
protect tab on but the second I took the tab off the disks became
trashed. Note that when booting off an original system floppy this
behavior was not exhibited. Everything worked fine.

Does this sound like a virus or a hardware problem? Since everything
works fine when booting off a floppy, I am inclined to believe the
latter.  Any clues, as I have not had experience with any viruses
before on my pc.

thanks

Hi everybody !!

   A friend of mine has just bought the new versuion of Norton Anti Virus ..
   It contains Clinic, and Detect which remains resident in memory (as
   McAffee's Vshield !) Clinic can detect 700 viruses ...

   Does anybody know something about it ??
   I'd like to know if Scan (McAffee) is better than NAV, or the contrary !
   I know that Scan is updated very often ... but ???

   Can anybody help me to make a choise between these two good softs ???

   Thanks in advance !!

howdy.  I have been asked to find out if anyone has experienced
problems with viruses infecting AT&T 386 machines (Unix) running
STARLAN 3.4, with LAN Manager ... connected to bunches of PCs, from
whence stuff like Wordperfect is loaded.  I'd guess that this would
have to come from a student's personal disks being put into the PC's

Subject: michaelangelo virus & HD's (PC)

Howdy,

Is there some other program for removing the michaelangelo virus from
a stricken hard drive....I have a Seagate 3120A (IDE) drive that I
cannot remove this virus from.  Here's what I have tried so far:

1 - Fprot 2.01 - nope
2 - Scan V80 - nope
3 - Scan v84 - nada
4 - Repartition drive as 40m and format - nope
5 - Return partition size to 100m and format - still there

what can be done?

any and all thoughts are appreciated.

Subject: Re: Macs Running Soft PC (Mac) (PC)

In VIRUS-L Digest V4 #233, Mike Taylor asked:

>     I regularly use Soft PC on my Macintosh SE.  Do I need MS DOS and
>macintosh antiviral programs or will an antiviral program for the
>macintosh suffice?

SoftPC does such a good job of emulating an MS-DOS machine that many
(most?  virtually all?) viruses WILL infect it. SoftPC uses a (big)
data file for the contents of the simulated PC's hard drive. I believe
Mac antiviral programs consider this to be a data file and do not
check it. Even if they did, they would not know how to recognize
MS-DOS viral code.

If you're worried, get yourself several MS-DOS antivirus programs and
use them. I have used an old version of the IBM Corp virus scaner
under SoftPC, but have not progressed beyond it as my MS-DOS
activities are restricted to data/document files and are well-isolated
from likely virus vectors.

I've got my fingers crossed, because I expect it will be more
difficult to control MS-DOS viruses--I don't know of a way to boot
SoftPC from the proverbial "clean floppy". If a virus-eradicator can't
clean SoftPC's hard drive, then I think we'll have to trash the
"SoftPC C Disk" Mac file and reinstall from scratch. I suggest backing
up documents (not applications) in a Mac folder. On the positive side,
those evil-wicked-mean-n-bad-n-nasty MESSY-DOS monsters won't be able
to break out of the SoftPC disk and infect our friendly Mac apps :-).

I agree with phaedrus@u.washington.edu (VIRUS-L Digest V4 #236) that
Manly almost certainly does not have a virus and he should probably
check startup documents (INITs) and control panel devices (CDEVs). But
I have two additional suggestions that have almost eliminated
"unexpectedly quit" messages on my system.

1. If you are running MultiFinder, increase the application's memory
allocation.  In my experience a number of poorly-behaved programs are
happier with larger allocations.

2. Increase the System Heap size. If you don't know what System Heap
means, "do not try this at home." This approach may work even if you
have already done the previous.

One good diagnostic tool: keep an eye on the About the Finder window
as you go about your usual activities. If a dark gray bar exceeds
about 80% of the total bar length, procedure 1 or may help.

(This is abridged from a longer note I sent him directly. If anyone
else is interested, contact me directly.)

Subject: Disinfectant (Mac)

The rest of the office has gotten Macs and is scared of VIRUSES :-(.
But as they do not, wish not, and will not get communication
capabilities, I have been asked to find a copy of disinfectant from
Northwestern Univ. for them.

Does anyone have a source for disinfectant?

And then once I have it downloaded to my PC from my host, is it
possible to get if over to the Mac.  While we do have some conversion
programs at the office, I am not sure if they will do a generic file
conversion (i.e. a byte-to-bye).  The program converts text files no
problem, but a compressed executable.

Oh.  If you have a source for disinfectant, I take it will be in some
compressed form.  Does the Mac community have a program similar to
pkzip/pkunzip which is also downloadable?  Mind you the same problems
of conversion from the PC to the Mac exists.

'Preciate your help in advance.

You get a few days off for the holidays and you start watching trash

featured viruses.  One so-called expert who has testified before
Congress and has some book out claimed that there are viruses out now
that can blow up monitors.

Anyone know what the name of this one is? :-)

Actually the LKA 222 (Computer fraud section of the Police) told me
about this. At the time, they were trying to take action against the

Subject: Review: A Pathology of Computer Viruses

I recently received a copy of "A Pathology of Computer Viruses" by
David Ferbrache of the UK Defense Research Agency.  The book is
copyrighted 1992, and is published by Springer-Verlag (ISBN
3-540-19610-2 and 0-387-19610-2).  US price was $39.50. 300 pages.

This book is an extraordinarily comprehensive book on the history,
theory, and operation of computer viruses, and on virus
countermeasures.  It is the most complete book I have seen on the
topic to date, and contains a very detailed description of how PC
viruses work and spread, including viruses in networked environments,
viruses in Amiga systems, and viruses in Unix.  In fact, I expect
David to get some criticism for the detail he presents, but it serves
to make the subject matter much clearer.

Chapter 1 is a general introduction to the topic of viruses, worms,
and malware.  Chapter 2 is devoted to the history of viruses and
"malware" starting from the 1960s and thru the end of 1990.  It has a
very complete description of the earliest viruses, including some
events and activities that have not been generally reported elsewhere.
It also includes interesting information on related activities, such
as the founding of the Virus-L mailing list.

Chapter 3 is a nice introduction to the theory of computer viruses,
including discussion of how computer viruses relate to biological
viruses, and other related topics such as artificial life.

Chapter 4 is a detailed discussion of how viruses operate in an IBM PC
environment.  This includes details on camouflage techniques and
signatures as well as spread and activation.  Chapter 5 provides
extensive discussion of techniques to protect against computer
viruses.  Chapter 6 is a description of how viruses work in the Apple
Macintosh.  Chapter 7 discusses viruses in mainframes and Unix
systems.

Chapter 8 is devoted to "network viruses" -- worms.  This includes
analysis of early work, the Morris Worm, WANK, Christma Exec, and even
a discussion of e-mail chain letters!  The chapter also has a nice
discussion of Internet protocols that lend themselves to abuse byd
material that I wished to pursue further -- unfortunately, there were
no citations to allow me to seek original sources.  I do not doubt the
accuracy of the information presented, but I feel that the lack of
specific citations is a flaw in such a scholarly work.

The book suffered from spotty copy-editing.  I found many places where
there were quite obvious typos.  In a few places, these typos obscured
the text's meaning or distorted some information.  I am not sure
whether to fault the author or the publisher, but is is sad to see in
an otherwise excellent book by an established publisher.

Another minor complaint is that there is no presentation of formal
theory about viruses or worms.  Although this is not an area that has
seen much good work, it would have been useful to have some coverage
of that material here to complement the higher-level descriptions.

The appendix listing other references was good, and contained some
references I have not seen before, but it did not give any indication
which of the many references were particularly noteworthy or why the
references were cited.  For instance, a number of limited-availability
BBS postings and Usenet articles were cited without an indication of
why they were included.  At the same time, the references did not list
either of the fine collections of readings by Professor Peter Denning
("Computers Under Attack" ACM Press/Addison Wesley) and Professor
Lance Hoffman ("Rogue Programs" Van Nostrand Reinhold), nor did it
reference any of the publications by the NCSA.

The book is written primarily for a British audience.  This means that
the coverage of US-specific items, such as anti-virus legislation, is
briefer than a US reader might prefer.  It also means that some small
translation of terms is necessary in spots; of course, this same
criticism can be made of many US-centric books being published in a
non-US market.

Despite these criticisms, I strongly recommend this book to anyone who
is interested in computer viruses and security.  It presents material
clearly and comprehensively, and provides unbiased coverage of the
area (David is not involved with the marketing of anti-virus software
or seminars as are many other virus book authors).
