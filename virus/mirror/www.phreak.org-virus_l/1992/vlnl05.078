Subject: Filler warning with SCAN & CPAV (PC)

	A colleague has the following, peculiar problem: He loads the
CPAV TSR from his AUTOEXEC.BAT, and later tries to use McAfee's SCAN.
SCAN will sometimes report that the FILLER virus is there, ubt often
will not.  Oddly, CPAV doesn't seem to know about FILLER, so he's a
wee bit nervous.

	Has anyone else encountered this behavior?  Can it simply
be attributed to weird anti-virus software interactions?

Recently I had someone call about a virus called 'Barry Mannilo' sp??
Supposedly this virus plays some tune and then blanks the screen.  The
person calling said that one of her co-workers saw something on the
news last week about this virus.  Does anyone have any idea of what
this person is talking about?  Scan 86b does not notice any viruses on
her system.

Any help is greatly appreciated.

A reoccurring problem. The important thing is that it is very good at
detecting that a virus is present (in the case of MBR infectors, if
it is unsure, what you normally get is the [GenB] flag. Lately my
problem has been different - VShield refusing to permit me to work on
a virus 8*).

More humerously, before the 6th I was demonstrating to a group of people
the [Mich] and forgot SafeMBR was loaded. Naturaly, once infected, it
refused to allow the boot to complete. Since I did not have a "dumb"
MBR available and the machine was running DOS 3.3, things becane a
touch difficult to demonstrate.

I have seen a minor change to the Michelangelo code do this, it has to do
with the signature string hierarchy used by SCAN. Since what is being checked
is technically no longer a "known" virus, this is considerably better than
no report at all.

If it walks like a duck, etc. It even makes some of the same mistakes as
STONED (plus some new ones of its own 8*).

Yes, I have reviewed about a year ago a version of this program. At
that time is was nice, but didn't offer as much protection as its
authors claimed. One of the tricks they used was to try to infect some
files and automatically extract a common scan signature from them. Of
course, it didn't work with the polymorphic viruses... I haven't seen
any recent version of the program, though. If you can reach the
developpers, tell John Deheaven and Alan Dawson that I say 'Hi'. Also
tell them that the three Catman viruses they sent me do not seem able
to replicate.

Remember, there ain't no such thing as a benign virus. For any given
virus it is possible to select a combination of hardware and software,
in which the virus will cause damage. This law has been first
formulated by Prof. Harold Highland, I believe.

Well, yes. What else did you expect? Overwriting the hard disk on
March 6? :-)

Yes, SYS C: will do the job. In the worst case, you'll have to use
Norton Disk Doctor's "make a disk bootable" option.

Well, let's say that the file VIRLIST.TXT that comes with SCAN is not
the most reliable source of information... I don't remember what
exactly the virus does, but I think that it saves the original boot
sector and the second part of its body in a bad cluster. I have to
disassemble it very carefully in order to decide whether it will
overwrite something on some conditions.

You are right, this is a boot sector infector (like Ping Pong) and the
files should be OK.

I didn't say that it is new, I said that it is bad... :-) I admit that
I didn't know that Virex-PC does this, but I don't have a copy of it.

Probably it hasn't beed advertized well enough... :-) Seriously, maybe
you should review the documentation and make sure that you properly
explain the people what they can achieve if they are using this
feature.

Oops, I cannot let this pass. Sorry, but you are wrong. The problems
is not whether it's better to use CRC or something else (but just as
easy to break); the problems is to use a -different- checksum
algorithm on each installation. Only this way you can ensure that the
virus writer will not crack your particular algorithm. The CRC has
this nice property that it is known how to generate good different
algorithms. Yisrael Radai has submitted an excellent paper on this
subject to the IFIP conference in Madrid. As soon as it gets
published, I'll ask him to provide it in electronical form for
anonymous ftp. It's a -must- for any wannabe developper of integrity
checking software. Several developpers of anti-virus software produce
internally flawed software just because they don't bother to listen
what the scientists say about it... Fred Cohen has predicted the
decline of the scanners about eight years ago.

Whether it has been done or whether you are aware of it is not
signifficant. What is signifficant is that the one method is
intrinsically flawed, while the other one isn't. BTW, long time ago,
somebody in Bulgaria has cracked the checksumming algorithm in
FluShot+ 1.80 and has distributed a program which modifies COMMAND.COM
in such a way that it displays "FluShot is STUPID! Press any key" when
run - all this without the modification act being detected by
FluShot's monitor (which is easy) and even by its checksummer (which
is the tricky part). Unfortunately, I don't have copy of this program
handy. Just remember - if it can be done, some perverted hacker out
there will do it.

Let's not be shortsighted. What still works today (but is flawed) may
not work tomorrow. I guess that when the first scanners appeared
(especially the programmable scanners) people like you thought that it
is a really great idea - there were a couple of dozens of viruses, and
maintaining a scanner was so easy... Especially when the Icelandic
viruses proved that the monitoring programs are a dead end.

Sorry, but you are wrong. The method that UT uses has a very stable
scientific background. Please, get aquainted with the underlying
theory before claiming that it's worthless.

Well, the theory and the people who have developped it -do- know,
believe me.

Nope, the reason is that the people who developped it tried to produce
a good integrity checker (and they succeeded). When they tried to
market it, they suddenly found out that everybody seems to think that
anti-virus program = scanner. And every reviewer checks how many
known viruses the package is able to scan for. Don't laugh, I observed
this attitude even in a competent anti-virus researcher. That's why
they patched a scanner in a hurry. Is it surprizing that the scanner
part is so bad? I hope that they have learned the lesson and will
improve the product.

Disclaimer: I have neither developped the Untouchable, nor am trying
to sell it. I'm even not using it. But I know the underlying theory...
:-)

Well, the current version seems to be as secure as UT. It is slower,
because it uses cryptographic checksums. It's access control can be
bypassed by a knowledgeable attacker who has a bootable diskette and
runs Norton Utilities in /Maintnance mode, as I showed to Dr. Cohen
:-), and a virus can infect it in the same way as it can infect an
UT-protected system. (BTW, I discussed this kind of attack with him
and he agreed that an integrity checker is not able to stop it, but
that such a virus will spread so slow, that it probably won't be a
practical danger.) It also can be disabled by a virus which is
speciafically oriented to the product, if the user does not always
boot from a clean system. The same is true for UT. Maybe Cohen's
product tends to be a bit more prone to that, since it does not
strongly advise the user to regularly boot from a clean system and
perform a full integrity check.

Anyway, the two products belong to different classes (UT is an
integrity checker, while the ASP Toolkit is an integrity shell), so a
straightforward comparison is not very fair.

I understand, but I still claim that the check is unfair. There is
nothing in IM, which provides the same level of security as UT's quick
check, so you just cannot compare. IM's full check is more secure than
UT's quick check (and slower), and IM's quick check is much less
secure than UT's quick check (and faster). That's why you should
compare what provides the same level of security. For those two
programs this is only the full check mode.

This is probably not a practical scenario, but it is possible. Just
like the CRC cracking - do you seriously expect that somebody's virus
will try to crack the CRC checksums by collecting a large number of
examples and trying to solve the appropriate system of linear
equations in order to find the polynomial? C'mon, everybody who knows
how to do that is more likely to do something else than creating
viruses... Yet you have taken steps to confront this attack in UT. I'm
just pointing you out another equally unprobable but possible
scenario. I agree that the UT's quick check is secure enough for
practical use, it is is not abused and the user runs the full check
after booting from a clean diskette, say, once per month.

Yes, unfortunately, this will certainly happen. And the (ignorant)
users will begin to rely entirely on such methods just like they are
entirely relying on scanners... :-( The same goes for the heuristic
analyse... Those are two very tempting ideas, especially now, when the
producers of scanners have begun to realize that scanning is doomed...
They desperately seek something to replace it with, so that they won't
be faced with the problem of hundreds new viruses appearing each
month, polymorphic viruses, constant updating which the user is
uwilling to pay for and so on... Heuristic analyse and generic removal
seems a "natural" way to solve the problems that the virus-specific
software has... Unfortunately, it won't work either, just the users
will have to pay for yet another bad move... Sorry, Yisrael, the above
was not against UT in particular, it was targeted to those who intend
to make their users rely entirely on these "new" approaches...

A much better solution is to build a multi-level defense, with BIOS
and DOS support, and with accent on integrity checkers and integrity
shells. I'm not saying that the virus-specific scanners, the monitors,
and the heuristic analyzers are just crap, I'm saying that they are
just a small (needed, but not very important) level in this defense.

Right, but if the memory requirements increases faster than the number
of new viruses, the program won't be useful after a while... :-)

...in practice. In you add only a reasonable amount of new viruses and
have enough memory. BTW, can you tell us some numbers? Suppose a
computer with 512 Kb RAM, running DOS 5.0. If the user boots from the
safe diskette with only the OS and UT on it, how much memory will UT
require and how many new signatures will be possible to add without
running out of memory?

Because your statement implies that you trust those programs. What

Ah, yes, in theory. If we could only make any software supplier

all the users to bother to check the authentication... :-)

Yep, but a good virus-specific disinfector will be able to remove more
viruses than a generic one, especially when the virus writers learn
how to create viruses which are impossible to remove generically,
regarless how clever your algorithm is (unless it's a full backup of
the file). You know very well that such viruses are possible.

Yes, and I fully agree with this. I just wanted to point out one more
time that the users must not rely -entirely- on a generic remover, and
that a virus-specific scanner is not -entirely- useless. All those are
just levels in the multi-level defense. Not as important as the
integrity checker, but necessary.

Of course. My point was that the virus writers devised an entirely new
method of attack against the integrity checkers, which forced us to
instruct the user to use a safe diskette, which is often inconvenient
for him/her and therefore s/he will dumbly not use it, regarless how

Nope, I don't mean a virus which is there, but never spreads. I mean a
virus, which spreads only on occasions when it will be undecidable for
the integrity checker whether the change has been caused by a virus or
not. Such virus -will- spread (although slowly), unlike the
"ambiguity" virus.

Of course, if it is known, a virus-specific scanner will detect it.
But what if it is a new virus?

Well, so does UTScan detect the viruses in memory or not? If it does,

If you are running a dedicated fileserver and a malicious program is
running on a station then you are talking about two different
computers which have NOTHING in common at the low level. The program
on the station cannot modify the disk on the fileserver by writing
directly to the disk controller on the file server. This is similar to
my inability to thump a guy talking to me on a telephone if he is in
another room. To stretch this analogy (probably too far) the best I
can do is ask him to thump himself.

My knowledge of networks is limited to one running RM-NET, a
derivative of MS-NET supplied by Research Machines Ltd. (a British
company). This system has so far proved reliable in a difficult
(university) environment.

Unfortunately, we have every reason to believe that Vesselin is
correct in his statement that each successive year the Michelangelo
problem will be greater than before.  We have, now, a reputable report
of Michelangelo's existence prior to March of 1991, and therefore
proof that the virus will survive.

Actually, no proof is needed, as this is quite obvious from the
operations of the virus.  On March 6 most copies of Michelangelo on
hard disks will self destruct.  However, as it is a boot sector
infector, and a member of the eminently "successful" Stoned family, we
know that there is an infected floppy which was used to infect the
hard disk in the first place.  The majority of floppy disks used
around the infected machine will also be infected, and thus "store"
copies of the virus which allow it to survive.

For those "in the know" it is difficult to understand why these copies
will not be found and cleaned.  However, the vast majority of the
computer using population does not understand the situation.  I have,
on more than one occasion, been requested to clean up a BSI infection
on a hard disk, and been refused access to the floppies used around
that machine.  (If successful at gaining access to the floppies, the
tone usually changes radically when I find a 30 to 80% infection rate
on the diskettes.)

There is, in this case, an additional vector: that of older, non-turbo
XT and PC level machines.  Indeed, in one local case, a Michelangelo
infection was detected on such a machine and tested (by setting the
clock ahead to March 6).  Since nothing happened, they figured the
virus was a hoax ...

	Except for all those floppy disks, that were the vector this
time around.  Do we really believe that everyone traced down the
original infection diskette and cleaned it?  And, of course there are
all those silly people who still do nothing about checking their
software.  What if they got an infected diskette on Saturday the 7th?
	I think we will have to keep March the sixth on the calender for
a while yet.
	Speaking of which, wasn't someone working on a viral "Hot Day"
calander?

I'm afraid this is not quite correct.  A user only needs READ, WRITE
and FILE SCAN Rights in order to change an ATTRIBUTE.

There still seems to be some confustion about NetWare RIGHTS and ATTRIBUTES.
ATTRIBUTES are an emulation and an extension of regular DOS file
attributes.  All DOS attributes (or NetWare ATTRIBUTES which exactly
emulate DOS attributes) can be changed by viruses.  Viruses can
therefor bypass most NetWare attributes.  There are only two
NetWare ATTRIBUTES which may prohibit viral infection, they are EXECUTE
ONLY and SYSTEM.  The SYSTEM NetWare ATTRIBUTE does not perfectly
emulate the DOS system attribute, and can prohibit viral infection.

RIGHTS are NetWare's own security implementation and can provide
much more protection against viruses than DOS can.  Viruses cannot
directly alter assigned effective RIGHTS.
               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*HOWEVER*, assigned Rights CAN be overridden through the use of the
Supervisory Right or by using an account with Supervisor or Supervisor-
equivilant rights.  The SUPERVISORY right will supersede any restricions
placed on subdirectories or files with an inherited rights mask.  And
a Supervisor or equilivant account can bypass all your work in properly
setting up user accounts.  Use of Supervisor accounts should be used
sparingly and not as general work accounts by network administrators.

1) Execute one of the infected programs. Yeah, right.

2) For each directory of the disk, execute the commands

	ren *.com *.coz
	ren *.exe *.exz

3) Reboot from a non-infected write-protected system diskette.

4) For each directory of the disk, execute the commands

	ren *.coz *.com
	ren *.exz *.exe

5) Run CHKDSK /F (optional).

That's all, the disk should be cleaned. Just make sure that you don't
run CHKDSK or any other disk repairing utility -before- step 5.

You forget that meanwhile it has infected thousands of diskettes which
are a potential vector for re-infection.

They cannot be -absolutely- sure. They can only be DAMN MUCH sure. If
you have 2^16 files of the same size but with different contents, at
least two of them will have the same CRC-16. If you have 2^32 such
files, at least two of them will have the same CRC-32. This is secure
enough for practical purposes.

Completely lost, sorry. The only way to store -all- the information of
the file is to store a (possible archived) copy of itself.
Unfortunately, this is space-expensive.

NETSC89B.ZIP    NETSCAN Version 89-B virus scanner for LAN's


WHAT'S NEW IN VERSION 89-B

     Version 89-B of the VIRUSCAN series fixes false alarms on the
Hafen virus in MONITOR.EXE, a utility manufactured by Adaptec Corp. for
SCSI controller cards, and on the Generic File virus in BLOCKCUR.COM, a
utility that comes with Toshiba laptops.

VERSION 89

     Versions 87 and 88 of VIRUSCAN were skipped due to Trojan Horse
versions which appeared on BBS'es in the US and Europe, respectively.
     Fifty-three viruses were added in this release, bringing the total
number of viruses to 534, or counting variants 1,263.
     Version 89 now also detects all viruses that have been encrypted by
the new Dark Avenger Mutation Engine.  The Pogue virus was the first of
these polymorphic viruses and has been reported Austalia, Norway, and
the United States.  In the past month two additional mutated viruses have
appeared--the Fear virus and the Dedicated virus.  It seems certain that many
more such viruses will appear in the near future, since the object code for
the mutating engine has now appeared on many virus-exchange BBS'es around
the world.
     Also added in this release is capability to detect nonspecific (new
or unknown) file-infecting viruses.  When a file is detecting containing
an unknown virus, SCAN will report the presence of a Generic File Virus
[GenF].  Files containing a Generic File Virus can be removed by running
SCAN with the /D option, however, please contact McAfee Associates to
send a specimen in for analysis.


SCAN
     Version 89 of SCAN now includes a "save option" feature that allows
systems administrators to pre-configure SCAN to default to scanning specific
drives, checking or not-checking memory, creating a specific report, or any
other command line setting for their end users.  The /SAVE option will save
all of the other options that are specified on the command line, or will reset
to the original SCAN defaults if no other options are specified on the command
line.  The saved options will be added to the SCAN.EXE file.  This option
should be set up by the systems administrator prior to distribution to the
end-users and installation on the end-users' machines.  A new VALIDATE.COM
has been included in this release.  It must be used instead of the old version
if the /SAVE option is used.  Otherwise, the validation results before and
after /SAVE will not match.


CLEAN
     Version 89 of CLEAN-UP adds eight new removers for the 855,
1241, 1554, Holocausto, M128, Mardi Bro.'s, Mosquito, and Traceback/3066
viruses.


VSHIELD
     Version 89 of VSHIELD adds the /SAVE option (see SCAN for details),
plus two other new features:
     The /RECONNECT option allows VSHIELD to regain control of the system
interrupts after they have been trapped by another program.  This allows
VSHIELD to be loaded before network drivers.  Then, after the network drivers
have loaded, VSHIELD can be reconnected without having to be first unloaded
from memory.
     The /NOCONT option prevents a user from being able to proceed with the
execution of programs that have not been certified when VSHIELD is run
with the /CERTIFY option.


NETSCAN
     NETSCAN adds detection of all new viruses added in this release.


VALIDATE
     Version 0.4 of VALIDATE has been released.  This version is able
to validate the software after the /SAVE switch has been used to store
options in SCAN and VSHIELD.  (VALIDATE.COM is included in the .ZIP
files for all programs.)
