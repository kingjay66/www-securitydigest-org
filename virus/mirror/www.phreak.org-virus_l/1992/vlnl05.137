VIRUS-L (not comp.virus) readers:

Yes, there are still some problems with the mailer, that are causing
you all to get duplicate VIRUS-L digests.  I'm sorry for this, and I
assure you that there is a LOT of behind-the-scenes work going on to
correct the problem.  Please bear with us for a little longer - we
hope to have the problems fixed shortly.  (Perhaps even by Volume 6...

After asking for tech advice, I got the following answers on win3-l.
These make me think, that the danger of infections is not bigger
within windows than under plain dos. Though the claims of these
companies are still dangerous and produce a wrong sense of security.
Eric Webb asked, if it would be a good advice, to use f-prot's tsr
under windows, too. I think yes, but don't know if it works. Did not
try it until now.

Any comments ?  ALfred

The reason I am opposed to self-modifying programs is simple: The
number of viruses is increasing at a dramatic rate.  If the number of
viruses continues to double every 9 months, signature-based virus
scanners will be useless within a few years and people will have to
rely on change-detection programs.

Any executable which modifies itself will set off an alarm, causing
some users not to trust it and wipe it off the disk :-)

This message is a posting by Yaron Bloom, SysOp of HyperActive BBS in
Jerusaleme m, Israel. I'm using danny's account to post it to the news
(he's a friend of me).

A few days ago, a user uploaded my BBS a file with an unknown virus in
it. (oh, i forgot to mention that I work as a virus researcher) - the
virus is a stealth, COM file infector. I'll describe some of it's main
characteristics.  The virus, once executed, will infect COMMAND.COM,
and will display a message, (Pascal like), which says something like,
"Run time error ### at ####:####".  Than, the system hangs. After
rebooting, the virus will become resident (the virus infects
COMMAND.COM differently than other files!) - and all infected files
would not show their (increased) file size.  The virus is a BBS
targeting, and would copy USERS.BBS (which holds all user names,
passwords, and more info) to files accesible by the users of the BBS.
There are 5 file names (encrypted) within the virus body, which are
used for this purpose.  Oh, I forgot to mention that NO scanner knows
this virus today, and it doesn't appear in the NCSA collection.  A
simple detection method to see if the virus is resident, would be:

mov ax,fedc
int 21h

if ax becomes 1324 (I'm not sure - but if you don't have the virus, ax
would become FE00) than your system is infected. The fact that I'm the
first who dicovered it, makes me think that it was written in Israel,
probbably to "hack"k " into BBSes here.

The virus was posted to other virus researchers by my employees.

Subject: Troi Virus (PC)

Recently, it was discovered that a few of the machines where I work,
were infected with the TROI virus. The machines are IBM PC's. We used
Scan & clean versions 9.3, to find and remove the occurances. I am
worried however that it might not have taken care of all the
infections. We noticed the virus at first because all of the infected
files were 322 bytes larger than normal, and also their time stamp was
set to 00-02-80. Checking by hand, we found approximately 25 of these
files, yet scan only detected 17 infections. Is there any way of being
sure they are all removed? (aside from reformatting the drives, that
doesnt appear to be an option since no one seems to have any backups:(
).
	Also, I would like to know a little more about the virus, if
anyone out there know about it. Things like:

	1 - How is it spread?
	2 - Whats its history?
	3 a)Where could it have come from?
	  b)Is there any file that users usually initially get it from?

I cant think of any way it could have gotten into our system. But
since I am a Co-op student, my position has been occupied by MANY
people over the last year or so. Any of them may have carried it in.

thank you for your time,

I have had LANProtect, Intel's anti-viral NLM, for a couple of weeks,
and I can offer these initial observations.

LANProtect is a virus specific scanner. It has four modes of use: to
perform regular pre-scheduled scans of the server, manually to
initiate a scan of the server, to scan all files being copied to or
from the server, and to scan the user's workstation. Each mode can be
configured independently to log all events, and to specify what action
must be taken if a virus is detected in a file: whom to notify, and
whether the infected file should be renamed, wiped out, moved to a
different sub- directory, or left unchanged; there is no disinfect
option.

LANProtect presents a very friendly and informative user-interface at
the system console.

In Virus-L Digest (Volume 5 Issue 120), Thomas DiBlasi asks:
> Has anyone in the net ever heard of Intel's LPscan or even uses it??

> supposedly works well with Novell Netware.

LPscan is a DOS program which users can run to scan their workstations.
The three server modes employ an NLM called LProtect. Both LPscan and
LProtect use the same signature file.

Is LANProtect any good?  I am left with some reservations.
The currently distributed signature file (upgrade 9) is dated 25 April,
and apparently can detect 650 viruses and strains for DOS and Mac.
However, this number has even less meaning that usual, since, when the
names are listed, there are many multiple entries. Also, the list of
names contains many typos, and some names are differentiated from others
only by the placement of a hyphen. The naming convention used to identify
viruses was unfamiliar to me. No information was supplied about any of
the viruses or their characteristics - but the install program carries
an advertisment for Patricia Hoffman's Virus Summary. It appears that
when numbers are used as virus names (as they are for 219 viruses), that
number does not necessarily correspond to the infective length of the
virus (as one might have supposed).

To estimate the efficacy of LPROTECT, I used it to scan 192 files
reported by the Secure Scan option of F-Prot as infected. (Results
from v2.04b, which I currently use, were the same as for v2.02, which
I was using in April.) Intel's LProtect reported infections in 166 of
these files.  Because of the different naming conventions, comparisons
between the similarity of the identifications was not possible. But I
formed the impression that LProtect has a coarser discrimination than
F-Prot.

I have not measured the effect that Real Time monitoring has on network
traffic, but, at present, I have no reason to disagree with Vesselin
Bontchev. However, I like the interface it presents to the system
administrator; the apparent control which it offers against viruses
coming from a workstation onto the server is very comforting. I wish
that I could believe that the anti-viral aspects of LANProtect were
equally as good, but the superficial evidence is that, as yet, they are
not!

I have a club-286 and I have encountered a strange problem. Many

This can happen under several circumstances.  You see, when disinfecting,
F-PROT will locate the sector supposed to contain the original boot sector.
If that sector contains a valid boot sector, it will be replaced, otherwise
not. If it fails, there are several possibilities.

   1) incompletely infected disk.  You wroyte you had saved a copy of the
      virus on a floppy disk...if you meant you just copied the boot sector,
      the refusal to disinfect is understandable - there is no original
      boot sector to restore.

   2) New version of the virus.  I cannot say if this could be the case, as I
      do not know which version of F-PROT you are using, or how it identified
      the virus.

   3) A highly non-standard boot sector.

   4) A bug in my code.  (I know they should not happen, but they occasionally
      appear).  All I know is that I can disinfect the NoInt variant on
      my test machines ant the diskettes I have tried.

I thought programs like this had all been scrapped a long time ago,
Most generic TSR monitors can be circumvented quite easily, and
several recent viruses simply jump into DOS, bypassing any interrupt
monitoring program.

My recommendation is to scrap the program, get a good scanner to find
viruses and a good checksumming program to find changes.

Hi folks,

We are reluctant to let the PC users freely upload files to VM in

- - Is there a case of VM virus infiltrated from a PC ?

- - What is the usual procedure of uploading files from PCs to VM
  in the States? I mean, do you let a PC user upload his/her files
  to VM or are those files scanned by the computer center to make
  sure that they are "clean" before uploading ?

Thanx..

Tell them to 'go for it' and don't bother to scan.  Place the
responsibility on the user.  He can't hurt VM with a PC executable.
However, he could write a VM exec on the PC, upload it, and run -
thereby bombing his machine(the assumption here is that the 'user'
does not have access to anything 'vital' on the VM platform).

VM however could be a vector for spreading 'infectious' PC (or other
platform) programs via the network (BITNET/INTERNET).

Really - this has not been a major concern (here at least)

                  The myths just keep coming ...

I'm not going to name the product, but you've all likely seen the ads.
Nine computer screens in a square across the top of the page, each
supposedly representing a different virus, with a little cutline
describing the effects of each.  In such a short space, how do they
get so much wrong?

"Friday the 13th Virus.  Alias 'Black Friday.'  Erases programs when
you try to run them."

Has anybody got a version that actually displays the text (as the ad
shows?)  Does it really display in a different font and size?  Does
anyone not know the description of the "Jerusalem" virus?  And how
about amending it to "erases *infected* programs when you try to run
them *on Friday the 13th*".

"Stoned Virus.  Alias Hawaii.  Data loss caused by damage to
directory and FAT."

Well, at least they got the name right.  (The first one, anyway.
Hawaii?)  Of course, *I* may have the wrong virus.  I've never seen
"LEGALIZE MARIJUANA" display.  In fact, I've never seen anything
display after the C: prompt.

"Datacrime Virus.  Adds garbage to files and reformats disk."

I suppose you *could* say that the Datacrime virus is, itself,
garbage ...

"Ping Pong Virus.  Alias 'Bouncing Ball'.  Wipes characters off the
screen."

There are, of course, a lot of variants, but I didn't think the
original worked quite so well as a screen saver.  And the "ball" is
a lot smaller ...

"Falling Letters Virus.  Characters fall to the bottom of the
monitor.  Creative, but a real nuisance."

So is this ad.  ASCII characters do fall *towards* the bottom of the
screen, but they won't make it if anything is in the way.  And they
don't leave trails.

Admittedly, this was produced by the marketing department.  But do
you want to entrust the safety of your computer to people who get
five out of eight wrong?
