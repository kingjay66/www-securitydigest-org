I think, this part of Nick's recent contribution should go into the FAQ
file. Thank you, Nick, for this concise and lucid explanation! However,
the question Nick had responded to was unintelligible to me. Could some-
one please supply a suitable question for this answer? (As the answer
is not "42", a question should be derivable with little effort :-)

I don't think, though, that disinfecting program-files is such a good
idea, after all. There are too many things that can go wrong (remember
Murphy's law?). It is always safer (and easy enough) to re-install clean
copies from the original, write-protected distribution-disks -- and
everybody has such disks for all software he/she is using, or, at least,
they are supposed to having those disks...

Still, I do think that it is a good idea for a virus-scanner to scan also
for internal infections in self-extracting compressed program-files, as
these are perfectly capable of replicating, and of delivering their pay-
load (if any) -- and, in many instances, the user cannot unpack those
files on his/her own (e.g. because they were already packed before they
were distributed to him/her). Hence, I am glad that F-PROT 2.03 will be
able to scan into some sorts of packed files (if I'm not mistaken), and I
hope that Frisk will cover even more packing schemes in future releases.
As I have explained, on 11 July 91, 09:43:29 +0200 (MESZ), it is not
enough to scan both for external and internal infections; rather, a good
virus scanner should be prepared for multiple layers of packing and con-
sequently check for multiple layers of internal infections.

Subject: DOS version Backward incompatibility (PC)

While dealing with distribution of anti-virus software on our campus,
we have run into questions of incompatabilties between DOS versions.

We initially gave out bootable disks formatted with /S under DOS 5.
(To remove viruses in general, one wants to boot from a clean system.)

There are clearly some systems that this is incompatable with.  I am
trying to find informed opinion on the limits of this problem.

The most sweeping assertion I've found is that writing to a hard disk
formatted with a version of DOS before 4.0 while booted from DOS 5
will damage the disk because of changes in the FAT format.

Other possibilities are that this only applies to:
   1 - Disks larger than 32M
   2 - Disks with partitions larger than 32M (created with OEM
       dos versions and disk managers)

If we want to approach this problem by distributing bootable disks
multiple DOS versions:

    1 - how many versions do we need? (I know having everyone
        bring in a disk formatted with their DOS version
        would be one approach, but I'm looking for a middle ground.)

    2 - Is there disk duplicating software that could take a file
        on a hard disk and write bootable DOS disks for a different
        DOS version, assuming we had previously given in a master copy?
        At the moment we are using .BAT files with a FORMAT/S,
        but this only works to produce bootable disks for one
        version of DOS.

Other suggestions?

I have a question concerning the use of MS-DOS 5.0's FDISK /MBR.  Is
it possible to use this feature on machines running lower versions of
DOS?  And, if it is, will it then designate the machine as a 5.0
machine?

It's clear then that if 90% are not fully checked there IS a loss of
ability to detect an infected file.  Since you were comparing two
products, my Integrity Master and Untouchable, it was vital to
compare similar modes if you're going to make a speed comparison.
You've got to compare apples with apples!

Please let's compare like modes of operation where possible.

I think that a 10% check is totally unacceptable.  Keep in mind that
both IM and UT often are used to detect other causes of file and
sector corruption.  Also 10 executions would NOT quarantee that all
files were checked (nor would 100 executions)!  This mode is of
limited use and certainly was not a fair basis for comparison with
Integrity Master's full check mode.  Every last byte of every file
is checked!

I'm glad to that you admit the deficiency of genreric detection in
at least this instance.

 >I didn't notice that IM had a quick check (as Wolfgang writes).
 >
You didn't answer Vesselin's question and you ommitted part of the
statistics you posted before. The stats showed how long UT required
in full check mode.  When you compare UT and IM in full check modes
IM is :28 faster.  A significant improvement since it means that
people will check their system more frequently if the product is
faster.

Who cares how many errors were in the draft review?  What matters is
that they were correct.  I certainly wasn't quoting from the draft
review but from the published version.

How will this be done?  Do they plan to save even more than the 40
bytes they copy from the front of the file?  It seems the only way
they could do this would be to backup the entire file.

I agree. However, I'm not sure that there will be a "next time we have
the public's attention."  Most of the TV and radio stations I've

In regards to your question, "Can viruses hide in non-executeable

Subject: Disk Compression (PC) (maybe Mac)

	Recently there have been a number of questions on the net
about disk compression and scanners. To explain we first must make
a distinction between the two types:

1) File compression - this refers to the compression of individual
   programs using techniques such as LZEXE and PKZIP. In the former,
   the decompression is attached to the program so that on execution,
   the file is first decompressed, then executed. With the latter,
   programs are first unZIPped and then used.

2) Disk Compression - the technique of applying compression to an entire
   disk or partition. In this case all programs on the disk/partition
   are archived into a single file (usually hidden) that generally
   will occupy nearly the entire disk/partition. When a program is
   requested, a special device driver that captures such calls searches
   its archive, locates the requested file, decompresses the file,
   and presents it to DOS.

   Since DOS does not care where the program comes from, everything is
   happy (why Networks look to DOS like still more disks).

   In recent months major improvements have been made to what appear to
   be the two market leaders (Stak Electronics "Stacker" and Addstor Inc.
   "SuperStor" so that there is very little performance differential
   between them and bare DOS.

   One major caveat: since these utilities have their own internal
   structures, anything that corrupts these (as some viruses will) may
   result in the entire partition becoming unreadable, much like a
   corrupt ZIP file - all of the data may still be there but you will
   not be able to get to it.

   On the plus side, compression houses are rapidly developing utilities
   that can defragment (vveerryy ssllooww - takes me an hour per week
   per drive) and repair such problems. IMHO it will be these secondary
   "pluses" that will make or break compression products.

	Meanwhile a persistant question on Virus-L has been one of the
effectiveness of virus scanners on compressed partitions. The correct
answer is that they work as well on a compressed partition as they do
with an uncompressed one. Since the files are all presented to DOS in
decompressed form, to the Scanner operating above DOS, there is no
difference between a compressed partition and a normal one. (Have tried
Novi, IBM Viruscan, McAfee Scan, F-Prot, Enigmal-Logic Virus-Safe,
Virus-Buster, CPAV, Xtree, & Dr. Solomon's - chosen because I *had* them
- - without any problems though have not tried to disinfect any files).

	Further, they are fully compatable with BIOS level anti-virus
programs as well since to the BIOS, the compressed partition simply
looks like a very large data file.

	In fact, the only potential problem might be with an anti-virus
program that tried to replace DOS calls for disk access with its own
(do not know of any that do but some access control programs might).
In this case success/failure would depend on what it tried to do.
(have been running SuperStor for some time & my BIOS programs have
proven compatable. Do not have Stacker in my den closet so haven't
tried it).

	IMHO existing anti-virus programs and scanners seem to be fully
compatable with disk compression techniques and work both better and
faster than with individual compressed files. The major virus danger
at the moment would be from those that "lie" to DOS (4096, Dir-II)
since their infection methods may be totally incompatable with the
compression structure (haven't tried it myself - we NEED a National
Laboratory).

Subject: Probably bogus warning & virus reporting (PC)

March 3rd, Roy Lurie posted a warning to this newsgroup stating that
the disks distributed with the book "Neural Networks and Fuzzy Systems"
by Bart Kosko, published by Prentice-Hall, contained the Michelangelo
virus.

I asked Marcia Horton, the chief editor of Prentice-Hall computer
books, to comment on this report.  She said that Prentice-Hall runs
virus check software on their disks when they are made.  They also
pulled some random samples of the Kosko book from the warehouse and
checked them.  None were contaminated with any virus, including
Michelangelo.

This is not to say that Mr. Lurie did not get the Michelangelo, nor is
to say that he did not find the virus on those disks.  However, it is
possible that he got the virus some other way and accidentally
infected his disks before he did the check; there are many other
possible scenerios, too.  I've known Marcia and other people at
Prentice-Hall for some time, and believe what she says, so I am fairly
confident that they didn't find the virus on their disks as implied in
the posted warning.

The reason for my post?  Well, on March 6th, I was speaking with
Marcia, in person, about the virus (at the ACM annual conference).  I
also talked with some other publishers who ship diskettes with their
textbooks.  They are all very aware of the dangers of viruses and do
what they can to check for them.  They will respond to any complaint
about what is on the disk.  However, they (like any other firm) do not
like to be accused of something that isn't true.  Causing a panic
among their customers is not a nice thing to do.

A problem with any such warnings is that they get passed on from
person to person and bbs to bbs, and they get changed along the way.
For months or years to come, people will be posting and reposting
warnings about how discs from publisher X have virus Y in place, and
how it has wiped out hundreds of disks.  It is a way to start
urban legends, really.  This just adds to virus hysteria, and in this
case, needlessly.

I would suggest that before anyone come to this or any other forum
with a virus report, they do the following:

    1) be very sure of the source of their copy of the virus
    2) contact the suspected vendor FIRST for their comment
    3) give the vendor the opportunity to post the warning, first
    4) don't post any warnings without some verification

Yes, many virus distributed by some vendors have been distributed with
Michelangelo in place.  Yes, PH could have done the same (but claim to
not have done so).  Yes, other vendors may do the same in the future.
But please do them the courtesy of checking with them first before
crying "Wolf," and give them the opportunity of checking and
responding.  Try to keep viruses from claiming more indirect victims,
please.

I know if I were Bart Kosko, I would be *very* unhappy about having my
book mentioned like this....

Actually, it *is* a fluke in some sense.  How well a virus spreads
seems to have very little to do with any qualities of the virus.  As
long as a virus has a certain minimum "competence" (which seems to
include being resident, not doing anything like printing a message
*too* often, and having no more than one or two really serious bugs),
how widespread it will become seems to depend on random factors not
associated with the virus code itself.  "Stealthing" and other
snazzy-sounding things, in particular, seem to have no impact at all;
this makes sense, I think, since "stealth" viruses are just as easy to
detect in general as non-stealth, once you know what you're looking
for.  (Also, "stealth" viruses are not easy to write, and therefore
tend to be buggier, and perhaps -less- likely to prosper!)

It would be interesting to know what event caused the Michelangelo to
become widespread in the population, when other basically-equivalent
viruses (the Swedish Disaster, the "Sanded" text-variant of the
Stoned, and so on) are extremely rare.  We're unlikely ever to find
out, though.

that I was wrong, and that "higher tech" viruses were not common
simply because they hadn't been around long enough.  We concluded that
only time would give us enough evidence; I would point to the
Michelangelo, a young and stupid virus that nevertheless got
widespread, as a datapoint supporting my side of the question...

It is practically impossible to get any data back from disk destroyed
by Michelangelo. Upon activation, Michelangelo overwrites the
beginning of the hard disk (it depends on the hard disk how long part
of it is overwritten; usually it is about 11Mb) with garbage it gets
from some certain location from memory.

Yes, Frodo / 4096 virus will activate on September 21st. It can be
well detected by all common scanners (Scan, F-Prot, VIRx, TbScan
etc.) if the system is booted from clean floppy. If there virus is
resident in memory, it can't be detected in files (=stealth virus, a
virus which prevents the user from seeing the virus code in infected
files; it can also remove itself from file every time when the file
is loaded (Frodo does just this)). It can be detected in memory,
though.

Frodo tries to place a new boot sector over the original on Sept. 21st
but the code which should place the boot sector is garbled in all seen
variants of this virus. Frodo will only hang the computer when it
tries to do this.

Actually, it's September 22 (according to F-PROT's Virus Info) -- and
"hit" does not mean what your supposed expert probably thinks: it does
not do intentional harm to data. I've sent you a file with more (though,
admittedly, incomplete) information about Frodo, this morning.

Lest I be misunderstood: I do *not* say that this virus is harmless.
Actually, no virus is ever harmless, as you cannot predict how it will
behave in a new environment (perhaps an environment still to be
invented), and you cannot predict into which environment a given virus
will ever spread. Hence my advice: eradicate all copies of all viruses
you encounter, no matter how harmless you consider them. And, having
found a virus, search for additional copies of it on all disks that
possibly were accessable to it, including all hard disks of all computers
that were in contact with any disk found infected, and again all floppy
disks that were in contact with any computer found infected, and again...

Never say "never" (nor "period")!

If a virus has a name, then somebody has named it -- usually because
he detected it in some way. And shortly (more or less :-) afterwards,
the leading virus scanners will be able to detect it, as well. In the
file I've sent you, there's a claim of 21. September 1990 that
FINDVIRU (from Dr. Solomon's Toolkit), Scan (McAffee), and F-FCHCK
(from Frisk's F-PROT, pre-2.0 Release) all were able to detect it. So,
this apparently is an old hat, and you may calm down. Just run your
favourite scanner and see to it that "Frodo does not live" any more
:-)

Good luck,

No-Int doesn't do anything except spread. But, when I was testing
virus scanners on the other day, I noticed that Scan 8.3B86 says that
all my disks which are infected with different versions of No-Int and
Stoned are all infected with No-Int (Stoned) virus. I'm sure that
previous versions of Scan did make a difference between those viruses.
F-Prot names those No-Ints and Stoneds just correctly.

I was wondering if anyone could tell me where I could get the
following information.  I would perfer an internet source.

1)  A listing of Virus Signatures.....

2)  Information on detecting and scanning for some of the stealth viruses,
    like those that return the original boot sector when the boot sector
    is read from the disk.

3)  Any other information that would be helpful in writing a public domain
    virus detector.

Thanks.

                MICHELANGELO VIRUS HYSTERIA SYNDROME

        Mass hysteria about a virus named "Michelangelo" has been
spreading rapidly in MS-DOS-based personal computer users around the
world.  This scare is "triggered" each year slightly before March 6,
Michelangelo's birthday.  No one is immune... people ranging from
university students to the staff of _Nightline_ have been affected.

        According to various psychologists, the Michelangelo Virus
hysteria is spread though almost any media channel... written,
electronic, oral, computer networks, or on-line services.  Once a
person is "infected", he will attempt to automatically spread the
hysteria to every person he sees.  The hysteria also corrupts base
reasoning and logic, so loss of common sense is often a symptom.  This
is unfortunate, since the hysteria can be eliminated at any time with
common sense.  This means that ONCE ACTIVATED, the hysteria cannot be
easily removed; the easiest thing to do is to let it dissipate
naturally on March 7.

        There have been numerous known occurrences of this hysteria at
the University of Pittsburgh's campus.  This has been caused by
saturated distribution of virus protection and detection software, and
repeated and redundant email messages.

        We advise you NOT to attempt to trick people into believing
that March 6 has already passed in order to avoid the hysteria.  (Even
though we tell you about 3 paragraphs later that we tried it anyway.)

        The Michelangelo virus hysteria displays pronounced symptoms,
which makes it easy to detect.  Some possible symptoms of this virus
hysteria include, but are not limited to...

1.  Running virus-checking runs 6,000 times (per disk.)

2.  Sending repeated and redundant email messages.

3.  Sending repeated and redundant email messages.

4.  Sending repeated and redundant email messages.

5.  Photocopying 50,000 flyers and distributing them in every possible
    location on campus.

6.  Irrational fear/paranoia of or destructive behavior towards
    computers.  (Pushing them off of rooftops, etc.)

7.  Using typewriters.

        In addition, Dr. Ima Quak of the Bureau of Useless and Lame
Laws advises that "we have determined that this hysteria seems to have
an almost annual cycle to it.  Perhaps this can help us in detecting
it."

        Any person that is not infected and has common sense can also
detect the Michelangelo Virus hysteria.


                                SOLUTION

        There are many trained psychologists that can detect and/or
remove the Michelangelo virus hysteria.  However, these steps are
usually not necessary.  The following techniques have been used to
combat the hysteria:

1.  Vigorous shaking and/or slapping.

2.  Large quantities of cold water (a fire hose, for example.)

3.  Avoiding watching _Nightline_.

4.  Accurate, brief, and non-redundant information.

        Rest assured that some steps *are* being taken to help prevent
this hysteria.  In fact, just yesterday University of Pittsburgh
Chancellor J. Dennis O'Connor approved $82,000 to form a committee to
appoint a committee to call a meeting to look into the matter.


                                FOR MORE INFORMATION

        Watch for future bulletins.

        If you believe you might be infected with the Michelangelo
virus hysteria, please slap yourself once or twice, and ask someone to
hose you down with a fire hose.
