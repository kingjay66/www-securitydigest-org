VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  (The complete set of posting guidelines is available by
FTP on cert.sei.cmu.edu or upon request.)  Please sign submissions
with your real name.  Send contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU
(that's equivalent to VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).
Information on accessing anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue
archives is distributed periodically on the list.  Administrative mail

Subject: Survey questions (PC)

At the request of Paul Ferguson, I'm forwarding some interesting
questions he recently posted on the FIDONET virus echo.  (Paul has
read access to the Virus_L, but can not submit anything directly.) I
thought these questions would stir up some interesting conversation
here.

My opinion on a few topics had been asked of me lately -- and I had
given it honestly, without any external reference. However, a few of
the questions that I responded to actually bothered me, simply because
it was my own opinion and I hadn't really sought any input from others
active in the antivirus arena on any of the topics that were addressed.

(A few of these questions were posed to me recently by another network
engineer concerning viruses and the damage potential in any given
instance.)

Actually, the majority of the following questions I composed myself,
but I'd like each participants candid input (with whatever technical
justification you can provide) on each of the following questions.
Please try to be as complete and concise as possible.  I'll combine
all of the responses and summarize into a small document for all of us
to edit later. -


1. What is the rarest virus?

   a. In your possession?

   b. In existence? And why, in your opinion?

2. What is the most common? Why, in your opinion, has it spread in
   such proportions?

3. What is the most secretive AND damaging virus? (Also, again, state
   why in your own opinion.)

4. What is the most mundane or non-damaging virus?

5. What, in your opinion, is the most intriguing virus that you have
   observed? Why?

6. Which of the existing "stealth" viruses utilizes DOS to it's
   utmost, or rather, which is most transparent? Why? Please quote
   technical/assembler references.

7. In what capacity do you see antivirus software playing a role in
   the next year?

   a. Do string scanners have a place in the future of antivirus
      software? If so, how?

   b. What do you forsee as the answer, in terms of effective
      antivirus software, to continue in the battle against massive
      onslaughts of "hacked" viruses and new variable encryption
      viruses, as well as new direct-action and TSR viruses?

Thanks for taking time to put your ideas and opinions to "paper". I
feel that the responses will prove to be a very interesting
compilation.

Thanks again.

Cheers from Washington, DC

VB>My own theory is that March 6 was the date of the creation of the
VB>virus (recall that it has been detected in April 1991).

Maybe the virus's programmer felt a kinship with Michelangelo
as a young man.

In 1495, a 20-year-old Michelagniolo di Lodovico Buonarroti
sculpted in marble am image of Cupid. Then he buried it in the
ground near Florence. The underground hibernation would give the
sculpture an aged look, and the young artist knew that antiques went
over big in Rome.

The ruse worked: The exhumed piece was purchased by no less than a
Cardinal. Michelangelo's "Trojan" artwork made its way into one of the
homes of the powerful. When it was revealed that the sculptor from
Florence was the creator of that classical-looking work, the rest
(as they say) is history.

Subject: DIR-II (PC)

 I was checking several computers for the Mich. virus when I discovered the
 Dir-II virus on two systems.  One was a IBM PS/2 model 50 running DOS 3.0.
 The other was an IBM PS/2 model 70 running DOS 4.0 and Blue Max, a
 memory manager.

 F-prot and Scan86 both detected this virus.  F-prot cleaned the model 50
 nicely, but Clean86 crashed when it discovered the first infected file.
 F-prot worked through the system, but was unable to disinfect several files
 due to some kind of compression mode.  Most of these files were from
 Blue Max.

 My questions are:

 1: Anyone have experience with the DIR-II virus?
    What does it do?  How does it infect?

 2: Is this crashing of the system a bug in the McAfee software?

 3: Should I worry about the non-disinfected software?

 A side note:

      When I ran Norton Disk Doctor a large number of sectors were
      crossed referenced, making for a very confused disk.   After fixing
      this, Clean86 ran through fine, but did not discover any virus.
      Since F-prot had been run previously.

      Thanks for any replies.

I ran into the same problem with Leading Edge DOS 2.11.  What I did
was to copy the files on the floppy onto my hard drive and to run the
scan and (part of) the install procedures from there.  Nothing was
flagged (and it's still running on the 8th) and the scan procedure
appears to run each time I boot up.  My question is whether, using
those procedures, am I protected?

Subject: Virus and distribution disks (GENERAL)

I saw in that newsgroup that some software distributors, including
Intel, shipped diskette with virus.

Is it possible to start a campaign so that distributors will check for
virus and advertise this (virus checked software).  This would (virus
check) increase price by $1, no more I think.  Otherwise, the safety
we think we may have by using only original software will vanish (i.e.
one reason of buying vs piracing is that the original is virus-free).

Any opinion about this?  WOuld it work, and would it be meaningful
(i.e. would a company expedites checked diskette with virus?).

Subject: Slight Improvement in MS_Dos Based security. (PC)

While this doesn't pertain directly to Virii, it is a useful computer
security hint.

While playing around with DR Dos 6, I found out that if you install
the security using DRDos SETUP, the user can go in and delete the
login command from the config.sys, which means that they are no longer
prompted for a password when they boot the machine in order to access
the C: Drive, bypassing the security.

However, (this is the good part), MSDos doesn't recognize the secure
partitions, and DRDos won't give you access without the appropriate
password unless you boot off of that drive.  This basically forces the
user to boot off of the floppy disk if he/she wants to access the hard
drive.  While this probably won't stop a smart virus, it will encourage
the users to boot off of the hard disk, running whatever virus checking
programs are in the AUTOEXEC.BAT

This would be useful, but it is not sufficient to prevent viruses
from infecting computer systems. To protect systems from viruses an operating
system should do at least the following (list far from complete):

1) Prevent all user programs from handling computer peripherals directly.
   If this is not done, a virus could could work directly with the disk
   drive and spread that way. Note that this rules out the possibility
   of MS-DOS ever becoming virus free.

2) Prevent the user from accidentally formatting a disk. I think this
   requires a multi-user operating system. When the user normally uses
   the computer he uses username A that doesn't have permission to
   format disks. If he wants to format disks he uses username B that
   has permission to do that.

3) Even this is not enough. All users should be prevented from changing
   the contents of the operating system executable that is on the disk.
   And a program should only be able to modify the files it needs for
   its operation, NOT every file its user has a permission to modify.
   This rules out every other operating system that I know of. (Well,
   not quite. But I haven't heard of anyone using Hydra.)

4) Furthermore, it should be impossible for one program to crash the
   whole computer. This requires that the operating system be proven
   correct with formal methods (using mathematical logic). This won't
   be possible for some time, if ever.

In short, a user should be prevented from doing anything that we don't
want a virus to do. It probably is impossible to completely stop viruses
but we _can_ make it very hard for them to work.

:I think the main reason operating system manufacturers haven't yet

The shouting doesn't help. DOS and Windows 3.1 are so un-secure that they
can't stop viruses from spreading. OS/2 and Windows-NT are on a much
safer ground there.

(It is easy to stop old viruses, but I am talking about the ones that
haven't even been written yet.)

At the moment, having an operating system that is immune to all but a few
specialised viruses being developed would be a big improvement.  I can see
the worry that virus writers would target any system that tries to protect
itself but still leaves some loopholes, but:

(a) each version of each o/s would (should) need a completely new version of
    virus to get around it.  There could even be slight differences in each
    copy of the operating system (e.g. if it requires the boot sector to have
    a certain checksum, the method of calculating that checksum could vary
    from copy to copy, as well as the contents of a few unimportant bytes).
    So that should discourage virus writers considerably.

(b) The amount of work required to write a virus should increase a lot. What
    annoys me at the moment is that there is such little effort required to
    create (or modify) a PC virus (compared with, say, VMS or Unix). There
    still could be some anti-viral code in the larger systems (PC-based Unix
    needs it most), but really you can't say that Microsoft are even *trying*
    to discourage virus writers one iota.

(c) Viruses written to use loopholes would be more noticable.  Not only would
    there need to be more code in them, if there are only a few loopholes then
    the code would have to be doing one of a few things, which is easy to look
    for; at the moment virus code might look like anything, including good
    programs, since there are so many alternative ways to write viruses that
    work on PC's, Amiga's, etc.  If it is easy for a person to tell that the
    code is trying to take advantage of a know loophole then it will be even
    easier for a program to detect it as a virus.

(d) The main thing is that there simply would be less viruses to worry about.
    Even if the number grows with time, they would keep going out of date.
    Once people (users, virus writers, and O/S developers) come to expect
    that it is normal for computers to *not* have viruses, but to have good
    security measures, then maybe we all will be less inclined to shrug our
    shoulders and accept computer viruses.  Most Unix and VMS users are more
    security-aware because we see passwords and effective access control all
    the day, and would make a huge fuss if even even one little virus got on
    the system.  To a smaller extent, the very presence of password protection
    on DR-DOS leads me to feel that it simply isn't supposed to have viruses
    or any unauthorised file changes.  Not that DR-DOS (nor VMS nor Unix) is
    perfectly secure, but if the operating system writer bothers about security
    to changes the outlook of the users as well.

Sorry, I didn't quite understand this. Some do at the moment, don't
they? (not just SuperStore coming with DR-DOS, but the use of LZEXE
etc).  It is probably worth it to O/S sellers more in reduced
distribution costs than as a boon for users, since on most hard-disk
based systems the O/S files account for a small fraction of the space.
(Okay, I don't use OS/2!)

Subject: invader found in killer.com (PC)

When running SCAN v7.9v84 recently, I noted that it identified the
invader virus on KILLER.COM.  Yet running scan on a different copy of
KILLER.COM no virus was reported.

I ran the supposedly infected KILLER.COM on a floppy-disk only system,
and got the standard message re stoned.  However, running scan again
afterwards, it reported invader was in memory.

Is there a compatibility problem between scan and killer, or is it
a real infection?    Can anyone out there help?

           re: Protection from Boot Sector Viruses.

Most anti-Viral experts love dissecting exotic viruses, and
scaring users with wild tales about obscure risks from targetted
viruses and other improbable life forms. Indeed if some of them
built houses they would be clad with 4" armorplate & have no
doors or windows!

However, despite all the fancy viruses in our zoos, Stoned and
its derivatives (Michelangelo, No Int, Stoned 16, Stonehenge,
etc) are probably still responsible for more virus incidents, and
more loss of data (mostly destroyed by panicking "experts", or
faulty A.V. software), than all the other viruses put together.
This despite the fact that these viruses are easy to detect and
easy to remove, have no stealth techniques, and even more
remarkably have a design fault in the infection mechanism which
prevents them infecting floppies on many modern PCs.

In 1989 I was a lecturer at Chisholm Institute of Technology when
a lab full of Olivetti M24s were struck down by Stoned.  In the
next few weeks we found several other boot sector viruses.  When
I wrote the program VET to deal with them, I devised a strategy
which can be guaranteed to keep out ANY pure boot sector virus.

The strategy is simple.  VET includes templates for a number of
common boot sectors.  When you install it you can add additional
templates if it does not recognise disks formatted on your PCs.
It also takes copies of the Master Boot Record, and DOS boot
sector, and records the Top of Memory.

When you use VET to check a floppy it first checks the boot
sector against these templates.  If it does not match any of them
VET advises you to replace it with a known clean sector.  If you
always do so you will never get a boot sector virus.  You will
also destroy any disk requiring you to boot from it, but in my
opinion using such a disk today is almost as dangerous as visiting
a brothel in Bankok.

If you (or your family!) are careless, and a boot sector virus
does get into your PC, VET will check the PC when it boots up. If
you get any of the known boot sector viruses VET will find it in
memory, disable it, identify it in the boot sector, and enable
you to remove the virus.  If you get an unknown virus VET will
almost certainly warn you that the top of memory has changed.
Unless the virus hides itself (and none of the common ones do)
you will also be told that one or other boot sector has changed.
If the boot sector has changed, but you do not have a known
virus, VET can put back the template it has saved.  Thus if you
use VET you are extremely unlikely to get a boot sector virus,
but if you are careless and do let one in you will immediately
be informed, and will almost always be able to recover with
minimal loss of time and no loss of data.

It takes random bytes from memory and starts at the partition table
and works it's way along the disk, overwriting everything as it goes.
Once your boot sector, partition table and FAT are gone I'm not sure
if it continues along the disk or if it just continues in a circle.
Either way the disk is pretty well trashed after this sort of
treatment, a very hard job to recover anything.

Subject: Yankee Doodle Virus (PC)

     I am experiencing some unusual (aren't viruses always unusual!
:-) problems with the Yankee Doodle virus in one of the computer
centers here on campus.  We are experiencing repeated infections of
the Yankee Doodle virus.  The PCs (PS/2s) have VSHIELD (version 77, I
know it's old) installed.  VSHIELD checks the memory upon bootup, as
well as the COMMAND.COM and VSHIELD.EXE files.  What I find unusual is
the persistence of the virus popping up.  We have about 12 computers,
and one of them seems to get infected every few days.  I've
disinfected Yankee Doodle about 15 times.  As I understand it, with
VSHIELD installed in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, a virus can only get in
and spread to other files if the user boots from an unprotected
floppy. Is that true?  Assuming that is true, it is very odd that the
virus appears so frequently because
   1) I have *never* seen anyone booting or running programs from a
floppy here, and I am in the center fairly often (can you say "CS
major without his own computer"? :-)
   2) The software used is always on the hard disk, and 95% of the
time people are using the "official software", i.e. Word Perfect, and
telnet, which are virus free when installed.  Very few people bring in
games (the games are all played on the Macs, these days).
     Now, I understand that someone could copy a program from a floppy
to the hard drive, or run a program from a floppy, but VSHIELD should
catch the virus once it is in memory, using its TSR features.
However, the 15 or so times I have disinfected the virus over the past
month and a half, the files that were infected were almost always
COMMAND.COM, VSHIELD.EXE, WP.EXE, and PUTN3270.EXE (telnet), and
sometimes only VSHIELD and COMMAND.  Only in one or two cases was
"non-officially installed" software found infected.  People seem to
bring in disks only to save their word processor files on them.

Odd implication #1) The Yankee Doodle virus isn't entering our computers
		    through the usual methods of infected floppies or
		    infected ftp'ed files

     The second odd phenomena is that the virus seems to be activated at
some point, infects all the files that a user executes before the next cold
boot, at which point VSHIELD finds COMMAND.COM or VSHIELD infected on boot-up
and locks up the machine (/lock, as it should).

Odd implication #2)  This implies that the VSHIELD TSR somehow isn't catching
                     the Yankee Doodle virus when it first infects, but does
		     catch it when it scans upon boot-up.

     I should mention that the 12 computers are hooked up via Novell netware
to a server which no students have access to.
     Any ideas what could be causing either #1 or #2?  I have been
reading comp.virus and/or VIRUS-L for a while, and thought I knew
pretty well how viruses behaved, but this has had me stumped.

Subject: New virus Milena(PC)

This Saturday I analysed a new virus. Its name is Milena Love virus.
Milena is resident parasitic COM & EXE infector.

When a program infected with Milena is executed, the virus will
install itself memory resident using standard Mem Alloc (DOS service
48h) and INT 21h will be hooked by the virus. After the virus is
memory resident any EXE or COM file opened by services 3Ch (create
file), 3Dh (open file), 43h (chmod), 4bh subfn. 00 (load & exec), 56h
(rename), 5B (new file) will be infected and will increase in length
by 1160 bytes.

Opened TXT files will be overwritten at the end with the string
   "I Love Milena...".

When DOS service 3521h (get vector 21h) is used, virus will return
original INT 21h vector and when service 2521h (set vector 21h) is
used, the virus will store new value in its own data area.
Milena checks if value of current INT 21h vector is address of the
Milena's entry point. If isn't, the virus will search segment found
in current INT 21 for saved value of Milena's address. Then it will
exchange this value for original INT 21h and will hook INT 21 again.

Infected files contain strings  "LOVE"
                                "I Love Milena"

For antiviral programs I am using string
                "3D 21 25 74 0E 3D 21 35 74 15"

Subject: Thunder Byte Board (PC)

Reading the UK addition of PC Magazine, I came across an article called
"Opal's Virus-Immune 386 Machine"
This 386/33's main selling point is a thunderbyte board, and it's associated
software, the software comes in both ROM and RAM, and monitors suspicious
activity, such as file attributes changing and formatting discs, it monitors
at DOS, BIOS and disk control levels.
PC Labs tested it against New Zealand II, Telefonic, Vienna, Cascade, Brain
and Italian (Not a too impressive collection :-) Brain and Italian on a 386 ?).
They said that it found the bootsectors on a DIR and the file infectors when
they tried to copy it too the hard disc. It's bad points were listed as a lot
of false positives, and it didn't have mounting brackets.
After all the waffle my real question is has anyone tested this thuraly. I'm
sure Opal have but I'm looking for independent testing which goes past 6
viruses. Or was anyone consulted on this product ?
I'm sorry if I'm wasting peoples time, but I don't recall mention of it on
here, so any responses would be gratefully received. The real question is
really is it worth paying for when F-Prot is free at home, and Bates is free
at my work :-)

Thanks

  >How do we treat OS/2 machines?  Do Boot sector viruses affect these
  >machines?  Do we disinfect for the same viruses as for DOS?  Will .exe
  >and .com files be affected by DOS viruses?

The short answer to these questions is that OS/2 machines suffer from
exactly the same insecurities that DOS machines do and can be damaged
by DOS viruses, since DOS programs can be run under OS/2 and DOS
diskettes can be booted on an OS/2 machine.  Boot sector viruses may
indeed infect OS/2 boot sectors (and the MBR).  However, since a non-
DOS operating system is loaded after the initial boot process, the
virus will not be active and is incapable of spreading.
File-infecting viruses will infect OS/2 .EXE and .COM files as easily
as DOS files, although the result will usually be a corrupted OS/2
program that won't properly execute.  You should do exactly the same
things to protect your OS/2 system that you would do for your DOS
system, e.g., scan all programs before running them, scan your whole
system periodically, never boot up from floppies, etc.  Things will
get a lot more complex when the first OS/2-specific virus eventually
comes along.
