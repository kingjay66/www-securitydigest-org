VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  (The complete set of posting guidelines is available by
FTP on cert.sei.cmu.edu or upon request.)  Please sign submissions
with your real name.  Send contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU
(that's equivalent to VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).
Information on accessing anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue
archives is distributed periodically on the list.  Administrative mail

Subject: VIRUS ALERT: New Mac Virus (Mac)

		    New Macintosh Virus Discovered

Virus: MBDF A
Damage: minimal, but see below
Spread: may be significant
Systems affected:  Apple Macintosh computers.  The virus spreads on
		   all types of system except MacPlus systems and
		   (perhaps) SE systems; it may be present on MacPlus
		   and SE systems and not spread, however.

A new virus, currently named "MBDF A", has been discovered on Apple
Macintosh computer systems.  The virus does not intentionally cause
damage, but it does spread widely.  Instances of the virus have been
found at a number of sites worldwide.

The virus has been discovered in games at a number of archive sites.
At those sites, the games "Obnoxious Tetris" and "Ten Tile Puzzle" are
definitely infected.  It is possible that other files may be infected
at some archive sites.  You should especially be cautious of any games
named "tetris-rotating", or "Tetricycle".

The virus does not necessarily exhibit any symptoms on infected
systems.  Some abnormal behavior has been reported, involving Mac
crashes and malfunctions in various programs, which may possibly be
traced to the virus.  Some specific symptoms include:
    * Infected Claris applications will indicate that they have
      been altered and will refuse to run.
    * The "BeHierarchic" shareware program ceases to work correctly.
    * Some programs will crash if something in the menu
      bar is selected with the mouse.
The virus works under both System 6 and System 7.

If you have downloaded any files from an archive site recently,
especially games, please do not use them or give copies of any of them
to anyone else until you are certain they are not infected.
Furthermore, we very strongly recommend that you DO NOT get any files
from the archive sites until the moderators at those sites have had an
opportunity to remove any infected files.

Currently, the virus is not found by (or evades) most anti-virus
tools.  Authors of all the major Macintosh anti-virus tools --
including commerical products such as SAM, Rival and Virex, and
shareware and freeware programs such as Disinfectant, Gatekeeper, and
Virus Detective -- have been informed of this new virus.  All are
planning to release updates to their software within the next few
days.  These releases will be through the normal distribution
channels.

Some specific information on some of these products follows:

    Tool: Disinfectant
    Revision to be released: 2.6
    Where to find: usual archive sites and bulletin boards --

    Virex subscribers will automatically be sent an update on
    diskette.  All other registered users will receive a notice with
    information to update prior versions to be able to detect MBDF.
    This information is also available on Microcom's BBS.
    (919)419-1602.

    Tool: Virus Detective
    Revision to be released: 5.0.1
    Where to find: Usual bulletin boards will announce a new search
		   string.  Registered users will also get a mailing
		   with the new search string.
    When available: now (2/20/92)
    Comments: search string is
	  "Resource MBDF & ID=0 & WData A9ABA146*4446#4A9A0"


Special thanks to the people at Claris who included self-check code
into their Macintosh software products.  Their foresight resulted in
an early detection of the virus, and has thus helped the entire Mac
community.  We strongly encourage other vendors to consider doing the
same with their products.

Subject: Conflicting Software & Odd Behaviour (PC)

  We recently purchased McAfee's WSCAN & CLEAN86B, with which I'm
happy. One of our scientists had Central Point's VSAFE and BOOTSAFE
programs (loading from his AUTOEXEC.BAT). Upon scanning with WSCAN, it
reported finding Israeli Boot [Iboot] and Filler. We booted from a
safe disk, ran CLEAN against Iboot and Filler, scanned again; no
viruses were found.
   Then we booted from his autoexec.bat which loaded the Central Point
programs; wscanned and it reported Iboot in memory. We changed the
autoexec.bat so VSAFE & BOOTSAFE wouldn't load; wscanned; no viruses
were found.
   Am I right in concluding that Central Point's memory resident
software is erroneously recognized as a virus by McAfee's WSCAN?

We're having some trouble getting F-Prot (2.02D) to run successfully
with AT&T DOS 2.11 (Yes, I know this is very old but fiscal
constraints what they are not everyone has upgraded to a modern
version of DOS)

What happens is we run F-Prot and get the message:
'*.TX0 not found'
then we get the DOS prompt

The English.TX0 file IS there; the same F-prot disk works fine on
the same machine with 3.2 or 3.3 DOS.

BTW,yesterday, the same experiment with 2.02B yielded
 *
and then the DOS prompt.

 Anyone else with old DOS experiencing this? I KNOW the correct answer
is to upgrade DOS, but any insights on how to cope with what we've got
would be much appreciated!  Thanks.

Hello,

We were using F-prot here and we noticed that it doesn't scan non
executable files.  This raises the question, can a virus hide in a
text file, and then transfer itself elsewhere?  We have no reason to
believe that this is happening, just curious.

The question I have concerns what appears to me to be conflicting
information from the two sources above.  One source states that the
Stoned virus and the Michaelangelo virus both copy the original boot
sector information to the same location.  The second source states
that the two viruses copy the original boot sector information to two
different locations.  Am I reading this wrong?  Which one is correct?
Could they both be right because they may be writing about two
different versions of the Stoned virus?  Thank you for any insight
into my confusion.  ---Randy

Subject: Memory discrepancies in DOS (PC)

Some versions of DOS (MS-DOS 5.0, DR-DOS, etc) can show a difference
of up to 1k between the BIOS and DOS memories when loaded in high
memory.  For example, when MS-DOS 5.0 is loaded in the upper memory
block (UMB), the memory control block chain ends at paragraph 9FFF,
one paragraph short of 640k (A000).  The UMB starts at 9FFF.  While it
would be nice to be able to compare DOS memory with installed memory
and say categorically that any discrepancy means there's a problem,
DOS itself exhibits behaviour that would otherwise be considered
suspicious.

Subject: Tracking of Michaelangelo (PC)

Greetings,
  If someone is tracking the virus, I can confirm it entered a
"sneaker-net" (people passing data files on floppy) and we are
tracking it at Vandenberg AFB, California.

  We used CLEAN to remove it, but I noticed that booting off of a
"clean" floppy made the hard disk unaccessable.  I had to clean it
with the virus in memory.  (after it was cleaned, booting off the
floppy was fine)

  Also, I would like to stress that WRITE PROTECTION HAS TO BE DONE!
This virus *ALMOST* made the full rounds because an analyst was
installing a new mouse driver and the original disk was *NOT* write
protected.  She then went on to other machines and almost created an
epidemic because she was updating drivers (this was her original load
disk).  FURTHERMORE, they 'never sw a virus before' so they (get
this!) tried to infect another system so they could change the system
date.  The hard disk wouldn't boot up and so it went back on the shelf
with other computers *WHILE STILL INFECTED*.

Does anybody know if a bulk tape eraser would be practical for erasing

  I ran into this Virus which added 2K to .EXE files (but not .COM
files for some reason).  Every time you executed the .EXE, 2K would be
added on.  The virus was also resident in memory.  Oh, in the 2K
segment would be the string "MsDos" which I used to find infected
files, but I'm not 100% sure I got rid of it entirely.  Anyone heard
of this virus or something similar and know whether it might still be
lurking on my hard drive somewhere?

maybe this depends on who you ask and how they define varient.  I
based my count on information from a major antivirus software author.
my personla experience is limited to the original version I discoverd
in June 1988 here in ohio.  This author explained the numebr of
varients to me when I told him his software (which listed ohio as
detected) did not detect my ohio - which I though of as the ONLY ohio.
He has updated his product.

Subject: PC COMPUTING article on Anti-virals (PC)

The February 1992 issue of PC Computing has an story on
their rating of 11 anti-viral products.

Maybe I am biased but there is no mention of F-PROT,
so my immediate reaction is THIS IS NOT COMPLETE.

The article does not score the products (or give details on
performance like Network World did.
Oh well.  The 11 products they did look at and the opening
remarks for each review follow:
 (reproduced without permission)

- -Central Point Anti-Virus
Of all the utilities we looked at, CPAV proved one of the easiest
to install, use, and configure.

- -Dr. Solomon's Anti-Virus Toolkit
Using Dr. Solomon's AVT is like breaking into a mad scientist's lab
filled with strange contraptions shooting off sparks.

- -McAfee Shareware series
 Viruscan and its siblings form a powerful and comprehensive if
no-frills package of protection, detection, and eradication products.

- -The Norton AntiVirus
The cachet of the Norton name might make Norton AV your first choice
in antivirus software, but our experience proved that the product
live up to the Norton name.

- -Novi
Antivirus software should not interfere with everyday computing, and
Certus' Novi comes close to that standard.

- -Pro-scan
The first commercial package from McAfee  Assoc. is clean-looking and
exceptionally easy to use, and it offers a simple, menu-driven
interface for all its operations.

- -Virex PC
Doesn't rely on infinite layers of menus and dialog boxes to get the
job done. Virex PC is quick, unobtrusive, and effective - exactly what
you want in an antivirus utility.

- -ViruSafe
Xtree's ViruSafe includes an almost infinite number of features an
options for virus detection and prevention. If you can sort through
the sometimes confusing number of possible configurations and
utilities, you'll find a handy antivirus program underneath.

- -Virus Buster
Virus Buster is the Berlin Wall of antivirus software.

- -VirusCure
IMSI licensed the scanning feature at the heart of its VirusCure
from McAfee Assoc.  You may find you prefer (McAfee's) command-line
treatment to this fickle and sluggish performer.

- -Virus Secure for Windows
Virus Secure for Windows is good for low-risk situations in which
signature scanning and file-monitoring are all you need.

It's unfortunate that so many people refuse to look beyond commercial
software.  If these products were marketed as shareware, they wouldn't
have a chance against their more capable competition.

Considering the rapid appearance and spread of new viruses scanning is
becoming increasingly dangerous to depend upon.  Yet, this is the core
technology that the leading anti-virals depend upon for their
effectiveness.

Thank you for mentioning my product but I am appalled that you
consider Integrity Master(tm) less secure than Untouchable.  If you
come to this conclusion based on anufacturer's claims or perhaps the
tremendous price difference in our two products, I can understand
this.  For the benefit of those who are not aware of my product,
Integrity Master verifies the data integrity of your files and system
sectors and also contains a very high speed virus scanner under the
covers.  I do not personally have a copy of Untouchable, but I have
customers who use both this product and Integrity Master.  They report
that Integrity Master is more thorough and faster than Untouchable.
It apparently detects more known viruses with its scanner component
and finds other discrepancies which Untouchable misses (I'll go into
these via private mail if you wish).  If there's something else
behind your statement, please let me know how I can make Integrity
master more secure.  If this involves sensitive information feel free
to continue this via private mail.  BTW, the latest version of
Integrity Master is 1.11. It should be at most distribution points
shortly if it's not there already.

Subject: WDEF infection at a school (Mac)

Richard Pavell asks about keeping floppy Macs clean (issue 32).

Disinfectant has an option to install an INIT which will do what you want.  It
 is a very small piece of code - 5K on a disk - and detects all currently known
 Mac viruses.  Since the population of Mac viruses is small and slow changing
 this is fine.  It doesn't remove the viruses, just warns you and prevents
 infected applications from running.

Latest version: Disinfectant 2.5.1.

Subject: Virus statistics sought

I am doing independent study for graduate credit on virus detection
and loss prevention.  I would appreciate any information available on
detected and destroyed viruses as well as current threats.
