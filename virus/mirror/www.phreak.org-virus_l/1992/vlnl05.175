FTP on cert.sei.cmu.edu or upon request.) Please sign submissions with
your real name.  Send contributions to VIRUS-L@LEHIGH.EDU.
Information on accessing anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue
archives is distributed periodically on the list.  A FAQ (Frequently
Asked Questions) document and all of the back-issues are available by
anonymous FTP on cert.org (192.88.209.5).  Administrative mail

NO ! (excuse the shout) FDISK /MBR does NOT lose DM partitions.
PERIOD.  (there are ignorant minds out there seeking elucidation and
mis-information can be worse than none at all)

(nor STACKER, nor SUPERSTOR, nor NOVELL partitions, nor
Bernoulli/Syquest drives) What happens is that when you boot from a
floppy without the proper driver in the CONFIG.SYS file *on the
floppy* they will not be accessable by DOS. Those partitions will not
be "lost", you just have not loaded the necessary driver to access
them.

Admittedly, the DMDRIVER.BIN is the most dangerous since it is
essentially unique to each system and if it is damaged could fail to
find the partition (I could but if you have to ask, you can't), but
FDISK/MBR has no effect on DMDRIVER.BIN (or anything other than the
code portion of the MBR which knows nothing about partitions other
than how to find the ACTIVE one).

You must realize that DMDRIVER.BIN is a "kludge" from back in the
antidiluvian days of DOS 2.x that permitted access of over-32 MB hard
disks with a special driver that replaced the DOS access mechanism.
After DOS 3.31/DOS 3.3+ which could access big disks (DOS 5.0 does it
better), such drivers became unnecessary though DOS still permits such
drivers today. ONTRACK never removed the capability (at least my Disk
Manager 4.0 has it) since it costs nothing to leave it in, but it has
been superceeded by the LARGE capability built into FDISK and FORMAT
today.

The "Desktop" and "Scores" items are files, not folders. It has been
proposed that semi-sophisticated users with a means of looking at
invisible files would be tricked into thinking that the "Desktop" file
was the Finder's "Desktop" file (the Finder's Desktop file is at the
root level, not in the System folder), and that the "Scores" file
would be dismissed as belonging to some undefined game or another. All
of these files contained enough information to perpetuate the virus,
even if one or more of them was removed.

Scores took advantage of a hole which allowed INIT resources to reside
in invisible files. This hole was closed in System 6.0.3, I believe.
Invisible files are no longer eligible to be executed as control panel
(cdev) or system extension (INIT) files. It is definitely closed in
System 6.0.7 and up.

The actual infection mechanism of Scores is nearly identical to that
of the nVIR virus: A modified CODE resource installs an INIT; the INIT
modifies further CODE resources in a _Launch trap. One of the INITs is
the vector; the others are the payload. Blocking access to the System
file and disallowing creation of INIT/cdev files without user
permission disables this mechanism.

We have encountered a direct action infector of C:\COMMAND.COM and
C:\DOS\COMMAND.COM which renames C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT to C:\AUTOEXEC.BAK on
Thursdays.  Presently, we have dubbed this "Thursday Autoexec".  We
had only one single sighting of this in the wild.

This is a COM appender virus which makes COMMAND.COM files grow by
452 bytes and spreads ONLY through COMMAND.COM!  It's a minor miracle
that this virus could spread (unless, "it gets lucky" [Dave Chess]).
Question: Has your mother recently purchased software or otherwise
obtained software that included its own copy of COMMAND.COM?

You can verify an infected command.com by debugging and noting that
it starts with: JMP [0104]

If all the above is true, NAV 2.1 can detect and repair this virus.

These results are not surprising nor should they be alarming.  There's
a ever going argument in the anti-virus field relating to the premise
that anti-virus software must be able to detect every absolute
infected file.  The opposing side argues that it is not necessary to
detect such files as those above (or specific files found in some
reviewers' collections) which do not create children of the same form.

The argument for the second opinion says that if you detect the
infected form of the children, you will know if something is going on
in the computer.  Once something is known to be affecting the
computer, theories related to integrity checking can take over.  Files
such as those created above and certain files in reviewers'
collections cannot spread in that convoluted form and need not worry
endusers.  (A version of this argument applies to whether it is
necessary to detect absolutely 100% of MtE mutations, i.e.  integrity
checking takes over.)

It should be the form that propagates that we worry about.  And though
you didn't note it, I'm sure all the files infected by your creations
were detected by all the packages above.  Thus end-users need not
worry about your peculiar forms of MtE files because you're not going
to put those files on anyone else's computer.  :-)

Not surprising - what you did was simply to add a new layer of
encryption to the files.  Of course, the virus could be distributed in
this form, and would probably replicate, but all the second (and
later) generation copies would be detected normally.

I am not at all surprised that my scanner, as well as the others
missed the virus - actually, no matter how you had encrypted it, it
probably would be missed.

In my case the reson I miss this particular sample is simple.  I scan
inside LZEXE-compressed files, but only for signatures - that is, I
uncompress the virus in memory, and run my scanning engine over it.
If I uncompressed to disk, and stripped off the COM/EXE conversion, I
would detect it, but it would slow the scanner down considerably.

I don't consider it a serious problem - basically it is equivalent to
distributing an old virus, with a new encryption wrapper...the
original sample will not be found, but all the second generation
copies will.

Starship is not exactly a new virus - and there have been published
some reports on it (by Dmitry Gryaznov, for example).  There is also a

One of *the* best scanners I know of, is:

                       Data:  +31 (0)85-212395

TBScan is shareware, and can be uploaded from several BBS's. For the
most recent version, call the 'data'-phone number (all baudrates).

TBScan uses identity scanning, but als heuristic scanning. The
heuristic scanning algorithm is rather new and seems to be (one of)
the best there is.

If you have more questions, you can always contact me, as I work on
some (mostly hardware) projects of ESaSS. ESaSS also sells a hardware

Correct, I have several times posted messages about the difficulties
to scan "the whole memory" under Windows in protected more... In fact,
it is still possible to do it there - by switching back and forth
between protected and real mode, but under OS/2 all bets are off...

The only Windows-specific virus that we know is not memory resident...
:-) As you can see, the virus writers have solved the problem in the
easiest way... :-)

This is a Hungarian boot sector virus that is not spread at all, so I
sincerely doubt that it has made it to Canada... It is much more
probable that you are using some other anti-virus software, like CPAV
or TNTVIRUS, that does not encrypt its scan strings and is causing a
false positive. If you are using CPAV, read the manual - it clearly
says that it is not compatible with any other anti-virus software. So,
throw away either CPAV or SCAN. If I were you, I would throw away
CPAV...

Hmm, if I recall my calculus class correctly, two chasing exponential
functions result in a sinusoid with consecutive peaks in (in this
particular case) in virus spread and in usage of anti-virus software.

I have seen several analyses of StarShip. Two excellent ones are by
Dmitry Gryaznov and Igor Muttik. Dmitry's analyse is published in
Virus News International (I think). Maybe Ken has Igor's description
on-line?

Commander Bomber is a damn hard thing... Something like the MtE, but
the MtE is about 2.5 Kb and this one is 4 Kb... :-( The virus itself
is relatively easy (I'll post a short description, if you are
interested) - just like the Dedicated virus is relatively trivial. The
hard thing is the code generation engine generates the small pieces of
code that transfer control to the main body... I have not "cracked" it
completely yet... :-(

Ha, yes, indeed, that's interesting. It's similar to using PKLite or
LZEXE, or one of the dozen other compressors to hide the initial
infected file. Of course, all replicants will be detected correctly,
but if the dropper (because what you did is to create droppers) will
remain undetected and continue to spread the infection...

I find this hard to believe... Did you try Gobbler with unencrypted
replicants of CryptLab? Did you try TbScan with unencrypted replicants
of Fear? Those scanners are usually missing these viruses...

I agree with you. There is no reason why scanners that claim to be
able to scan inside PKLited and LZEXEd files (and SCAN, F-Prot, and
VirX do claim to be able to do so; F-Prot even scans inside files
compressed with other compressors) should be unable to scan inside COM
files converted to EXE format...

You are right, it's impossible. That's why, our tests can only prove
that a scanner is NOT able to detect the MtE-based viruses reliably.
Otherwise we can only say that we have been unable to find an MtE
replicant that the scanner does not detect.

Here is the long awaited report about the MtE detection tests that we
performed at VTC-Hamburg.  It is rather longish, so maybe Ken should
consider splitting it into parts.  Normally, I should have put it for
anonymous ftp, instead of publishing it here, but the preliminary
results of the tests raised enough interest and discussions, so I
decided to publish it in a whole in this newsgroup.  Nevertheless, it
- -is- available for anonymous ftp as

ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de:pub/virus/texts/tests/mtetests.zip

[Moderator's note: Vesselin's MtE tests are also available from:
      cert.org:pub/virus-l/docs/mtetests.zip
I have broken Vesselin's tests down into multiple chunks and will be
posting each separately.  Thanks Vesselin!]

Enjoy.  Comments, questions, and suggestions are welcome.

Regards,
Vesselin

Subject: Goblin Virus (PC)

This question is about the Goblin virus that was found by a Mexician
researcher on her diskette which was only one of a colection of discs
she brought o the Uk with her.

We erased the virus but I would like to hear from anyone else who may
have stopped this virus on their network/hard disc/disc.

I use Dr.Solomon's version 6. Toolkit to clean the boot sector which I
was told was the area affected.

Any views on Goblin much appreciated the Computer Centre here at LUT are 
also interested on any extra information

Subject: Re: OS/2 Viruses (OS/2)

I hope this message is not a FAQ. I currently support approx 150 OS/2
high performance PC's & I am trying to establish the effective threat
from OS/2 viruses, if any. Does anybody have any information about
OS/2 viruses.

Many Thanks.

Subject: Tripwire release (UNIX)

This is to announce the first public release of "Tripwire."

Tripwire is an integrity-monitor for Unix systems.  It uses several
checksum/signature routines to detect changes to files, as well as
monitoring selected items of system-maintained information.  The
system also monitors for changes in permissions, links, and sizes of
files and directories.  It can be made to detect additions or
deletions of files from watched directories.

The configuration of Tripwire is such that the system/security
administrator can easily specify files and directories to be monitored
or to be excluded from monitoring, and to specify files which are
allowed limited changes without generating a warning.  Tripwire can
also be configured with customized signature routines for
site-specific checks.

Tripwire, once installed on a clean system, can detect changes from
intruder activity, unauthorized modification of files to introduce
backdoor or logic-bomb code, (if any were to exist) virus activity in
the Unix environment.

Tripwire is provided as source code with documentation.  The system,
as delivered, performs no changes to system files and does not require
root privilege to run (in the general case).  The code has been
beta-tested in a form close to that of this release at over 100 sites
world-wide.  Tripwire should work on almost any version of Unix, from
Xenix on 80386-based machines to Cray and ETA-10 supercomputers.

Tripwire may be used without charge, but it may not be sold or
modified for sale.   Tripwire was written as a project under the
auspices of the COAST Project at Purdue University.  The primary
author was Gene Kim, with the aid and under the direction of Gene
Spafford (COAST director).

Copies of the Tripwire distribution may be ftp'd from
ftp.cs.purdue.edu from the directory pub/spaf/COAST/Tripwire.  The
distribution is available as a compressed tar file, and as
uncompressed shar kits.  The shar kit form of Tripwire version 1.0
will also be posted to comp.sources.unix on the Usenet.  No mailserver
access currently exists for distribution, although we expect some
archive sites with such mechanisms will eventually provide access.

Questions, comments, complaints, bugfixes, etc may be directed to:
genek@mentor.cc.purdue.edu (Gene Kim)

VIRUS-L readers may remember the historical significance of November
3rd...]

A group in Australia, called CVIG (Computer Virus Interest Group)
often publishes very competent tests of anti-virus products. Try to
contact Wayne Boxall.

Also, at the Queensland University of Technology, they have a very
strong virus research center. Prof. William Caelli is the head of the
center.

Vesselin
