VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  (The complete set of posting guidelines is available by
FTP on cert.sei.cmu.edu or upon request.)  Please sign submissions
with your real name.  Send contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU
(that's equivalent to VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).
Information on accessing anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue
archives is distributed periodically on the list.  Administrative mail
(comments, suggestions, and so forth) should be sent to me at:
krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

BTW, an idea for the developpers of integrity checkers. The following
heuristic might be useful. If the integrity checker detects that the
first, say, 20 files have been modified (the number should be
adjustable by the user), it should stop and ask the user whether all
these files have been really replaced with updated versions and that
there might be a resident virus lurking in memory, so continuing might
infect the other files. Of course, the user must be able to force
continuation of the checking process.

Everyone: please don't use this scan string. It translates to:

	POP	DX
	POP	BX
	POP	ES
	POP	DS
	RET
	PUSH	DS
	PUSH	DX
	CS:

which is a perfectly legitimate code and could be found in normal
programs too (and thus cause false positives)...

Yup... After a Stoned+Michelangelo infection the machine becomes
non-bootable because the MBR is lost. Therefore, it cannot be
disinfected, since there is no saved MBR which can be put back to its
place. The only solution (if you don't have a copy of the MBR) is to
boot from the DOS 5.0 system diskette and to run FDISK /MBR.

Other weird things like monochrome VGA, DOS 5.0 loaded high, active
DOS partitions larger then 32 Mb, and applications running in graphic
mode are also not advised if you want to see the virus replicate...

No. But define "data" and "document". Are PostScript files
"documents"? They could carry a virus. Are Lotus 1-2-3 macro files
"data"? They could carry a virus... Remember - any data that is
interprettable at some point can be used as a virus vector.

Fortunately, currently no virus exploats these things. Also, a virus
that infects only, say, PostScript files, is not likely to spread
very widely.

No, assuming that there's no active virus in the memory of the PC with
the clean disk.

Well, to me the above means that a virus is indeed able to fix the
pointer so that a virus code is executed instead... At most, it will
have to be able to interpret/fix the WIN.INI file. Pretty trivial...

Yes, but one keeps wondering why Microsoft is introducing new security
holes instead of bothering to close the previous ones... Is it so
difficult to provide at least an option to turn the keyboard mapping
of ANSI.SYS off? Why should the user have to edit it or to use third
party programs?

Why the installation process of Windows does not allow the possibility
to have the "imbedding" option turned off?!

It doesn't have to be that sophisticated. It's enough for the macro
language to allow DOS commands to be executed and to have some kind of
"startup" macro - a macro that is executed each time the appropriate
spreadsheet is opened... For more information ask Prof. Harold
Highland or read the appropriate article in Computers & Security -
such a research virus, using the Lotus 1-2-3 maco language has been
constructed. It can be done.

Yes, the feature really exists in Novell (although I think that only
in the latest versions; 3.11?) and CPAV really uses it (although I
have no idea why it has not been documented). At least one more
product I am aware of uses the same feature - the networked version of
V-Analyst (the Untouchable for the USA).

	The Zenith Z-248 had this feature - you could either boot only
from floppy, only from HD, or first from floppy then from HD (normal
PC behavior).  I don't know if they kept this feature in their 386
machines, but I liked not having to worry about accidentally leaving a
floppy in the drive.

I was recently called to examine a system that was not letting it's

Looking back through the virus-l digests, I think your best solution may
be to get Padgett Peterson's FixMBR program, giving me a chance to do a
reasonable amount of testing on my prog before release.  Also if you use
his SafeMBR this will give a warning if Stoned reappears.

The explanation of the problem stands, and I noticed that there have been
several similar questions/answers recently, how about putting it in the FAQ

Subject: Virus In Printer?

How much credence can I place on this recent piece from the "New
Scientist?"

Just as you thought it was safe to rely on virus-handling programs to
guard your computers, Feedback [name of column] has bad tidings. Some
of the newest viruses can play a nasty trick: they store themselves
on your printer.

This is possible because when a computer prints out a document, it
often sends data to the printer which specifies which font to use.
The printer stores this data in its own memory. If the virus attaches
itself to the font data, it can hide in the printer while a program
cleans the computer of all known viruses. It then runs back down the
printer lead into the computer again.

I checked the date of the issue and it wasn't April 1st :-)

Well, not actually dissected...but there are several cases that come close.
Typically this involves decrypting the virus signatures, and then modifying
the viruses so that the existing signatures become invalid.

The Peach virus is another example - it disables the Central Point program
in an incredibly simple way.

A few viruses check whether certain anti-virus TSRs are installed, and avoid
activating if that is the case.

Subject: New files on Eugene (PC)

I have just added the following files to the anti-viral archive on
eugene.gal.utexas.edu (129.109.9.21). If you have any questions or
problems please send email to perry@eugene.gal.utexas.edu.

ASIG9205.ZIP
HTSCAN17.ZIP
TBRESC19.ZIP
TBSCNX31.ZIP
VSIG9204.ZIP

On a side note, I have been transferred to a different department and
I will now be administering eugene on a full-time basis. I am
currently waiting to hear about whether the anti-viral archive on
beach.gal.utexas.edu will be continued. I will keep everyone updated
on the status of beach. I wish to thank everyone for making the
archives on eugene a booming success!
