Carlos Aquino asked:

	Is is possible for a virus or other destructive programs
	to permanently destroy a hard drive by overwriting some
	factory made information on it?

I believe the answer is yes.  Certain IDE drives can be damaged if you
do a "low-level format" of the kind that is routine in setting up MFM
or RLL drives.  IDE drives need to be low-level formatted in special
ways that can often be done only by the drive manufacturer.

This is not a danger for all IDE drives.  I understand some IDE drives
will refuse the regular low-level format calls.  Also, some drive manu-
facturers distribute special low-level formatting software for their
IDE drives (e.g., I got such a program for my Western Digital "Piranha"
drive from the WD BBS).  But some (I'd assume especially the early IDE
models) are probably at risk.

SCAN and other virus checkers can handle Stacker-based drives without
problems -- provided you are running Stacker.  If you are not running
Stacker, the Stacker-based drive will just look like a single =huge=
file, and no virus checker will be able to do anything useful with it.

You need to set up your "clean" boot disk so that it has the Stacker
disk driver (plus some other programs) and the necessary stuff in the
CONFIG.SYS file to invoke Stacker.  If the "C:" partition is set up to
use Stacker, you will need to remember to do a virus scan on the non-
Stacked part of "C:" as well, since this part of the drive contains the
boot stuff plus copies of all the files the system will need before the
Stacker driver is invoked.  The Stacker documentation explains how to
either (1) "unmount" a Stacker drive and get to the original partition
underneath, or (2) keep both the original and Stacker partitions acces-
sible at the same time via different drive letters.

	I have recommended that after disinfecting/restoring their
	systems, that these people STOP using STACKER. Any comments
	about such programs will be appreciated.

Please reconsider this recommendation.  It is excessive and unwarranted.

As I've said above, there is no reason to avoid Stacker or other com-
pressing disk drivers out of concern over viral infection.  You just
have to do a bit more preparation in your boot floppy, that's all.

By the way, Stacker works by compressing an individual disk allocation
unit (generally set up with a size of 8K bytes) into zero or more 512-
byte sectors.  The compressed version is then written into a large,
contiguous file which was preallocated for use by Stacker (and which
typically encompasses almost the entire partition).  Stacker maintains
all the necessary mapping info so that it can find the compressed data
corresponding to any disk block.  The whole process is totally transpar-
ent to end-user software.  Since individual disk blocks are compressed
independently, Stacker works fine even with randomly accessed files.
Stacker comes with a set of utilities for fixing problems with Stacker
partitions, defragmenting a partition in a way consistent with the pro-
gram's file block allocation scheme, etc.

I do not work for Stac Electronics (makers of Stacker).  I'm just a
satisfied customer.  I have been using Stacker since around the first
of the year, with no problems.  I would heartily recommend it.  I also
use McAfee VSHIELD (just sent in my money a week or so ago).

The big problem with write-protection is that somebody, some time has
or will remove the write protection to write there, at least when
putting the files there. For example, some diskettes come from the
factory on write-protected diskettes with infections already.  If the
tab is easily removed and replaced there's always somebody that thinks
of a good reason for changing something on the disk, at which time it
can be infected.

The second problem is that it doesn't stop a virus from being active
in memory, if you run an infected program from disketee it might not
be able to infect files on your hard disk, but it could infect other
floppies and deliver its payload (garbage on the screen, etc, etc, but
presumably not trash your whole hard disk).

The hardware protection on the PC is, indeed, true hardware
protection. Same with all the CPM and minicomputers that I know of.
However some PC's have faulty hardware; if you have a trusted
write-protected diskette you take from machine to machine (e.g. with
diagnostics), remember to check it for viruses every so often (I HAVE
KNOWN A DISKETTE IN EXACTLY THIS SITUATION TO GET INFECTED).  Also,
for what it is worth, some computers (with 8" diskette drives) use the
write protect tab the other way around i.e. it must be ON to be
writable.

As for hardware protection of hard disks, there are some (quite cheap)
solutions that basically involve cutting the write line to the disk
and replacing it with a resistor to +5V.  There are software
protection systems that can, in theory, be bypassed (there may even be
software on a 386 (etc) that could never be bypassed by a virus, but
that's another story); however the software solutions may be "good
enough" at the moment, especially when you consider people will want
to have some writable area on the hard disk, or want to change their
software at times, and will inevitably switch off protection for a
while.  If this ability is used carelessly you could be better off
having a (theoretically less secure) software system that retains some
security in such situations, or (better still) a mixture of hardware
and software where you can only write to the disk is you insert a key
AND what you are writing is vetted by some software which itself is
known to be secure because of hardware protection of the disk it is
on.

Hmm, a thought....
What if virus scanners contained not only a list of scan strings to
identify viruses, but a list of exceptions, such as a list of file
name, size and the virus that would seem to be in it, plus enough
bytes or some sort of checksum to be pretty sure we're talking about
the same file.  At first I thought it might be a security risk
(temptation to virus writers to make their viruses look like that),
but after thinking about it I think it should be okay for file
infectors.

Micelangelo reports, 2nd draft

To all who sent in reports, many thanks.  A more extended report on
Friday's (and recent past) sightings.  I have also tried to assign
confidence levels to the reports.  I have coded them as to "distance"
from the reporter (1h = first hand, personal observation, 2h = second
hand, reported directly to me; etc.)  and have also tried to note
"routing" (3h, mm/med/rcmp = someone [mm] heard on the radio [med]
that the RCMP reported ...)  Often the distance and routing will not
equal: I have tried to estimate confidence as best I can.

New Zealand - our two best contacts evidently did their job well, and
had almost clean shops (2h, ma).  Other areas reported a "detection
rate" (in advance of the deadline) of 10% in some areas (3h, ma/jb).
One other direct report "no one but me" (2h).  Some news reports of
"biggish companies loosing everything" (3h, ma/med).

Japan - MITI had stated earlier in the week that Japan would not be
hit as it didn't use MS-DOS much (2h, med/miti).  MITI, and seven
other companies, reported hits today.  (MITI only reported one.)(3h,
med/miti)

China - announced hits in spite of official claims of "about 10"
reported occurences.  The Ministry of Public Security will be
conducting a nationwide survey to assess the extent of the damage.
(3h, med/china)

Poland - earlier in the week was reporting detection rates of as high
as 25% (3h, med/?)

Finland - two hits confirmed, one school, one home.  (2h, tk)

Germany - reported heavily hit by CBC, conspicuous by the absence of
reports from Vesselin.  Too busy?  :-) One report on VIRUS-L (3h, vl).

South Africa - reported by CBC to have had 1300 hits.  However, the
wording of the report may have referred to early detections.  A second
report seems definitely to refer to 80 hits (activations) reported
from another source.  (2h, med/cnslt)

Paraguay - 10 networks wiped out (3h, med)

Argentina - 2 networks hit (3h, med)

US - New Jersey Institute of Technology reported to have cleaned 2400 of 3000
computers earlier this week (est. cost = $60,000, mine) (2h)
   - largest oil company in Houston, and 200 small to mid sized businesses
(est. cost for recovery of computers, assuming backup, $2M, mine) (3h, tm/ja)
   - eastern university reporting a couple of hits (2h)
   - state government offices in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Nevada (3h, med)
   - offices in the Senate and other federal agencies (3h, med)
   - 3 foreign mission offices (3h, med)
   - 200 copies found at NASA (3h, med)
   - 7 hits in Florida (2h, pp)
   - one media report on the sale of antiviral software was unclear, but may
have referred to the "sale" of the "free" special Michelangelo versions of the
Norton Antivirus and Central Point Anti-virus

Canada - major metal supplier "tested" for the virus by playing
"Michelangelo roulette" (setting date ahead to Mar. 6) late last
night, lost that machine and cleaned up the rest (3h, kc/med/cmp).
Two Baptist churches reported hit in the Vancouver area, later found
to be confusion with which church.  The one I can confirm is my
brother's church, and that was cleaned up at 2350H March 5 (2h, gs).
Local school board found a copy on one machine, tested on old machine,
did not trigger, figured Mikey was a hoax.  (Any bets the test machine
was a really old XT?  Wonder if they got hit and are now lying low.
2h, rp) UofA reports one hit (good work, Tim, 2h, tm), NRC reports
four disks cleaned (2h).  One radio station in Quebec, and one in
Vancouver area hit (2h, kc/if 3h, mk/med).  Another Vancouver report
noted two infections had been found and cleaned in advance and
continued to say that the "push" for preventive measures undoubtedly
saved millions of dollars, but would be seen by the media as a scare
since the systems "saved" weren't as newsworthy as systems "killed"
(2h).  One student council computer at the University of Manitoba,
report unclear whether the detection was in time (3h, kc/med).  Report
from a local computer store that the technical experts decided to
reset the clock to avoid March 6, triggered the virus and lost one
computer, decided thereafter to scan and disinfect the remaining
machines (2h, js).  An IBM representative is quoted in the Vancouver
Sun of March 7 as saying that no IBM or IBM compatible computer has
crashed because of the virus (2h, med).

In other news:

McAfee is quoted as saying clocks on machines that triggered on
Thursday (a fair number of reports of that) were set ahead by
"accident".  No one is reporting the significance of the leap year.
Apparently PS/2 Model 30s share this fault.

A ClariNet news report on the use of date resetting to avoid the virus
specifically gave instructions to use the MS-DOS "DATE" command.  No
news reports that I have seen to date have explained the difference
between the "DOS" date and the system or clock date.

A number of reports of users playing Michelangelo roulette, including
one that lost a full 170M hard disk (170 "shelf feet" of printout,
gone).  Another found the virus, tried to disassemble it with DEBUG,
and triggered it.

A number of reports of CLEAN and the NAV Special Edition "damaging"
disks and partitions.  No report of the fact that NAV Special does not
check for any other virus.  (CPAVSE checks for some "Friday the 13th"
families, at least.)

The "Cirrus" banking network was down for a brief time on Friday, and
was reported by the media to have been hit by the virus.

One report (lost) tells of a firm which specifically lost its accounts
receivable computer.

Very few reports of the upcoming Thursday the 12th, Friday the 13th,
Saturday the 14th, Maltese Amoeba next week.

On Usenet, there was one brief reference (in jest) to Michelangelo in
alt.national.enquirer and a fairly lengthy joke about the Michelangelo
Hysteria Virus in rec.humor.funny.

Story of the year:

One user supplied a copy of a detection program to his sister, who
found the virus at the radio station where she worked (in Quebec).  He
called the corresponding station nearby, and offered to scan their
computers.  They turned him down, stating they were sure they did not
have the virus.

Friday morning, they powered up and lost the hard drive.

Why not use F-Prot on your Novell servers as well? All you can do is scan

there.

Set up a userid with supervisor equivalence and one (and *only* one)

F-Prot with command line options and log out afterwards. Works fine.

The reason I specify one network drive is that F-Prot will change to
the root of *every* mapped drive, and scan the entire volume. This
results in a much longer execute time than is necessary, as things
get scanned several times.

Hello Mr. Levine,

It sounds like you may be running VIRUSCAN in conjunction with another
anti-viral program on your PC.  I would recommend that you check your
AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS for other anti-viral programs, try
commenting them out and rebooting the system, and then seeing if the
viruses are still reported in memory when you re-run VIRUSCAN
(SCAN.EXE).

Subject: New (I think) virus: TROI VIRUS (PC)

Last night I (actually my room mate and I) found a virus that is not
detected by f-prot 202d (secure scan, heuristics picked it off
though), McAffee's scan 86x, or NAV.  It hooks interrupt 21h and traps
the load and execute function.  It will infect any *.CO? file when
executed.  The virus will be located at the end of the file.  Inside
the virus code the text string "The Troi Virus" will appear.  Troi
uses DOS function FCh to see if it is already resident returning A5h
in AL.  When initially executed Troi will move itself to 0000:0200h.
Troi adds about 322 bytes to infected files.  It does nothing besides
attemp to replicate.

Troi is poorly writen.  It contains code to maintain the original file
date but this does not work properly.  It apparenly only affects com
files with an initial jump instruction but it makes no effort to check
the target file for an initial jump so com files without an initial
jump are destroyed.  Lastly it contains code for a critical error
handler but it is never referenced nor does it hook interrupt 24h.

If this is indeed new I will forward a copy to legitimate virus
researchers if they ask me to.

I have a late report for you. Mikey was a big scare here in Savannah
GA.  As far as I have heard 2 Law firms, were known sites with the
infection.  The Corps of Engineers was theorized to have it, same with
City Computers.  Glad to report that the City and the Corps were

You don't mention whether the system date (as reported by the DATE
command) was correct or not.  If it was, yet files you create have a
different date, PANIC!

I'm assuming you have a PC with a battery-backed clock, and that
you've first checked your computer for viruses with scanners like
F-PROT v 2.02 and SCANV86b, and that the system date is incorrect,
just like the dates of newly-created files.

There are some non-virus date problems that could cause it, here are
the ones I've come across...

(1) The battery in the CMOS clock may be getting old, but it is usually a case
    of the time going wrong progressively

(2) If it is an XT, do you have the correct timer utility? (there's timer.com,
    clock, setclock, getclock, etc... all work with different cards, and may
    seem to be okay at first for the wrong card).  Or maybe you thought you set
    the date with the DOS date command, but it doesn't set the CMOS, so when
    you next boot your computer it will be wrong.

(3) If it is an AT, I have found thst DR-DOS version 5 gets the date wrong
    sometimes (about 4% of the time) on some computers - probably due to
    timing problems and the fact it seems to bypass normal interrupt calls
    (maybe to avoid the next problem) - but I'm not sure of what goes on in
    there.  Early versions of MSDOS and PCDOS don't set the CMOS date when you
    set the date with DOS's DATE command.

(4) Then there are hardware faults (including design faults in some clones),
    that could possibly be the problem.

So, check for obvious hardware & software faults first (if it is an
old battery, try switching off the computer for a long time and see if
the problem is worse; try different versions of DOS; try removing any
odd drivers, TSR's and memory managers).

Ideally, boot it off a clean DOS 3.3 floppy and don't run any
programs, other than what came with DOS on teh clean write-protected
diskette. Reboot a few times, and try it over at least a day (if you
can spare the computer long enough).  If it works okay, try booting
off tha clean floppy, but run your normal software.  If that still
works, try booting from your original disk without any fancy drivers,
etc.

Hope this helps,

	 I found some of my .com files with odd dates on them, like
00-02-80, 10-02-80, 00-00-00.  Anyways they grew some, and the
appended code included the string "The Troi Virus".  Anyways, for no
particular reason I decided to run scanv86b, and it didn't come up
with anything.  I've looked at virx19, fp-202d and neither of them
found it.
	I was hoping someone would know a little something about it,
ie what it does, and how to get rid of it.  Really appreciate any info
as I don't want to turn on my computer unecessarily untill I get rid
of it.

VIRx almost certainly IS in error here.  We have had a number of false
positives for the V2P6 virus reported by users of the recent VIRx
releases.  Programs include older versions of mem.com, popdrop.com,
and HP.com.  We think we've got it taken care of in the NEW release
VIRx21.ZIP, available now on the usual anti-viral FTP sites and from
our support BBS (919) 419-1602 v.32bis.

	This version includes detection of many new viruses, and a
different sample disinfector.  The disinfector is for Maltese Amoeba,
encrypting file infector due to trigger on March 15, and thought to be
fairly common in Europe.  The disinfector is active in VIRx version
2.1 through March 20.  VIRx is free for individual or educational
institution use, still.

Subject: Integrity features in operating systems

On the issue of building antiviral and integrity features into PC
operating systems, Bill Murray writes...

 >Note that there is no rememdy available to the operating system writers
 >that will have any impact in this population in the short run, even if
 >they gave it away.  Look at the acceptance of all the free virus
 >protection software that is already available.  The use of this is very
 >sparse...

I agree that incorporating antiviral and integrity features into PC
operating systems is a long-term strategy, given that most computer
users are not very assiduous in obtaining software upgrades.  However,
the sooner OS writers (read Microsoft and IBM) get on the bandwagon,
the sooner it will start to make a noticeable difference.  And yes, it
will take years.

The old technical issue vs. management/personnel issue is brewing
under the surface of this debate.  Yes, we will have virus writers as
long as there is evil lurking in the hearts of programmers.  However,
we will only have computer users getting infected by the likes of
Michelangelo, Stoned, and Jerusalem, as long as most computer users
use operating systems with no built-in security features.  The point
about these features being built into the operating system is that for
such features to be valuable in curbing the proliferation of viruses,
a large percentage of PC users must use them.  In my opinion, the best
way to bring this about is for them to come with the operating system
and to be automatically installed when the OS is installed.  Only then
will most people use them.

And I very stongly agree when Padgett says,

 >The real question is Integrity Management by OSs, Virus protection is
 >just one result.

The basic (technical) issue is having an operating system that meets
acceptable criteria of STABILITY (it won't crash when a virus tries to
infect the system), RELIABILITY (you can count on your computer being
available to do work, even on March 6 and Friday 13th) and INTEGRITY
(the OS, maybe with BIOS support, insures that no virus can insert
itself into the normal boot or program execution process unbeknownst
to the user, or modify files that shouldn't be modified).  DOS and
OS/2 definitely don't meet these criteria.

And lastly, Bill says,

 >Perhaps we will never stop looking for magic for dealing with this
 >problem, but neither the bios nor the operating system are it.
 >They are simply not as universal as we think of them as being.

I'm not looking for magic.  I'm just looking for an PC operating
system that doesn't place 100% of the security\integrity burden on
me.  And maybe I missed something, but the last time I looked, all
computers had a BIOS and operating system...

Subject: Re: Antiviral features in operating systems?

One thing that I don't see discussed in this thread is the trade-off
between the ease of use of the system and "antiviral features."  My
microcomputer experience is mostly with Macintoshes, which have a
highly configurable operating system.  Changes to the operating system
to add optional new features, drivers for new types of devices, and
other third-party convenience features such as a screen clock rely on
the ability to make changes in the RAM image of the system.

The mechanism is to have files which are of a type automatically
loaded into the system, some of which by necessity change operating
system calls.  This leads to a very simple method of adding a variety
of user-chosen options to the basic operating system:  Simply add the
files to the system folder (directory).  Operationally, there is very
little that distinguishes the behavior of these beneficial add-ons
from potentially malicious viruses.  Ironically, some of these add-on
programs are anti-viral or security-oriented!  Eliminating this
feature from the operating system would make the computer much less
useful.

Taken to an extreme, it is easy to make any computer virus-proof:
Install only the approved software, and then never move information to
or from the machine except by typing on the keyboard or using the
printer.  If you don't exchange information, you can't get infected.
But this defeats the whole purpose of computerizing information
management.

Hello.
Just to report the availability of VIRx21.ZIP.  This program was sent
to me directly by the authors.  Following is the note sent with the

Subject: new TBSCAN uploaded to oak.oakland.edu (PC)

Hi All,

I uploaded the following file to oak.oakland.edu:

<MSDOS.TROJAN-PRO>
TBSCAN33.ZIP  Thunderbyte Virus Scan 3.3; needs VSIGyyxx.ZIP

It replaces TBSCAN32.ZIP in the same directory.

List of improvements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- -> Errorlevel system changed. Automatic virus detection programs / batch
files might need to be changed.

TbScan now also searches for a signature file named ADDNSIGS.DAT. This
file is intended to contain emergency signature updates. It will be
distributed in an archive named ASIG*.ZIP immediately if a new signature
is defined. See the VIRSCAN.DAT file for more information.

Implemented register indirect branches. This to increase the reliability
any further.

TbScan now also warns if an EXE file has no stack. Many viruses simply
leave out a stack. The warning consist of a "s". Warning "o" is removed.

The TbScan package now contains TbScan.Sys, which is a tiny device driver
which solves some compatibility problems. If you had to use the -compat
option you may now instead install TbScan.Sys (only 64 bytes) to enable
TbScan to bypass some resident viruses and to speed up TbScan. Read the
manual for more details.

TbScan is now faster than ever due to another optimization and a new
disk cacher. TbScan will now allocate all available memory for cache
buffers, unless you specify the -compat option.

The option -nosnow has been changed, now you have to specify -nosnow
to avoid snow on CGA monitors. This because more recent CGA systems
don't "snow" already by themself.

Option -extract has been added. This option causes TbScan to display the
first 20 bytes of the entry-point of every program. This enables you to
define a temporary signature if you have a virus that is not yet
recognized. Consult the manual for a "do it yourself" guideline.
This option is available for registered users only...

Option -once now restores the screen and cursor at termination.

Option -data (-f) in the environment variable now works again.
