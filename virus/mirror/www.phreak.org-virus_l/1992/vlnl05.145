Subject: Info on "Invol" virus (PC)

   Hello everyone,
   following is a preliminary analysis of the "Invol" virus:
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Suggested Name: Involuntary
Location      : U.S.A.
Type          : Encryptive, resident EXE/SYS infector with damage trigger
                Program entry is modified to point to the virus decryption
                code appended at the end of the victim. File size will
                grow by 14xx bytes. The size change can be observed with
                a DIR command, no stealth attempt is made by the virus.

Interrupts    : 21h via direct access to IVT
hooked             Checks for AX = 4B00, LOAD/EXEC request

                Virus handler will always have 0014 as the offset
Scan string   : No simple scan string is available for EXE files due to the
                encryptive nature of the beast. In memory (INT 21h handler)
                and SYS files, you can check for:

                3d 00 4b 74 03 e9 45 02 50 53
                52 1e 06 b8 02 3d cd 21 73 03

Damage        : Overwrites the first ten sectors of the first FAT on C:
drive
and trigger     using INT 26h (absolute disk write).
condition       It triggers every month on the 14th day and displays the
                following message before doing damage:

                   "You have helped spread this virus
                   This has been a message from your friendly
                   neighborhood infection service.
                   Thank you for your involuntary cooperation."

                After the message is displayed, the mentioned area of the
                C: drive will be overwritten and the computer will hang.

Comments      : This virus uses a crude 16-bit XOR type encryption routine
                to evade identification. The encryption key is obtained
                from the BIOS timer (low word only). The decryption loop
                also contains a bunch of NOP instructions for confusion.
                The general routine used for encryption is fixed and
                the virus does not qualify for fully polymorphic.

                     LOOP_TOP:
                               ...
                     ad        lodsw
                               ...
                     33 c2     xor     AX, DX
                               ...
                     ab        stosw
                               ...
                     e2 ??     loop    LOOP_TOP
                     e9 ?? ??  jmp     VIRUS_ENTRY

                When it first activates, it will try to read the
                C:\CONFIG.SYS file and look for device drivers to infect.
                It checks EXE victims fo 'MZ' signature, not extension,
                therefore any program loaded via 4B00, and that has an MZ
                signature is infected.
                The virus avoids multiple infections as follows:
                   If the difference between the SS field and the SP field
                   in the EXE header is equal to 5Ch, then assumes already
                   infected; otherwise, infect now.
                File access during infection is via handle-oriented DOS
                functions. If the victim is write-protected, it will NOT
                be infected since the virus does not attempt to clear
                the file attribute if a request to OPEN for READ/WRITE
                fails.
                The message shown above occurs twice in the infected SYS
                victim. The virus seems to go after
                        device=?:\?ansi.sys
                in C:\CONFIG.SYS.

Have you looked at VET which is made my CYBEC in Australia.  Very easy
to install, also has memory resident software including a device
driver that checks every floppy-disk when it is put into the
disk-drive.

Has other utilities also, including saving the CMOS setup to disk just
in case the battery runs out or it is corrupted by a virus.

It is also legetimate to give to give copies to people to install on
their home computers as that is where an infection will usually come
from.

For out site licence, it averaged 10 to 15 Australian Dollars per
on-site computer.

I have had this problem as well.  It appeared when I used a
replacement keyboard while my orginal was beening fixed.  I have a
solution in the form of a DEBUG script retrieved from FIDOnet.  The
text with the solution attributes it to Microsoft.  If anyone wishes
it, I can post it to the appropriate group.  (alt.sources.misc ??).

of:

	Turbo Anti-virus,
	McAFee, and
	Untouchable.

Can I have your thoughts for the above. Else, if anyone has got a
better suggestion, I'd love to hear it.

Thanks in advance

Subject: BIOS Virus Protection (PC)

	 A major development seems to have quietly slipped in that
should make it possible for effective *free* reduction of risk to PC
users who have purchased their machines in the last year.

	As you may know, for some time we have been saying that the
easiest means of protection from boot sector infectors (Stoned, Azusa,
Michelangelo) is to disable floppy booting (the major source of such
infection). I have been giving away copies of NoFBoot (in the FixUtil
package at many sites) to prevent such accidental warm-booting from a
floppy however, as has been said only hardware can prevent cold floppy
booting.

	In the past, I have lauded those manufacturers (Zenith,
Tandon, NEC) that have built such protection into the BIOS. Yesterday,
I had occasion to replace the motherboard in my 386-25 (expanded from
4 to 8 MB & the machine refused to recognize the addition - turned out
to be a MB problem).

	In the process my 1989 vintage AMI BIOS (AMI, Phoenix, & Award
are the three major clone BIOS manufacturers) was replaced with an AMI
dated 5 May, 1991 and referred to as the "New" BIOS. In the "Advanced
Setup Menu" is an entry for "System Boot Up Sequence" which may be
selected as A:,C: (original flavor) or C:,A: In the second case, boot
will be from A only if C is unbootable (what the "unbootable" criteria
are, I do not know - yet). In addition, the BIOS permits password
selection for both BOOTUP and BIOS alteration.

	Now, since these setups are something that even many
technicians are not comfortable with (often people call with "slow"
PCs that recover miraculously with a proper interleave or removal of
wait states - my "new" system got a 28% Norton SI boost with proper
setup - from the factory they are set to accomodate "worst case"
peripherals & chips).

	At any rate, IMHO this is all the hardware that is necessary
for a PC to be "safe" (see my models of a year or two ago), everything
else necessary to protect a PC from anything except *possibly* a
directed attack on a specific configuration can be handled by layers
of software. (I could but today's viruses can't).

						Warmly,

							Padgett

BTW - if anyone knows where I could pick up 2 or 3 8-bit CO-AX Ethernet
      adapters (speed not important, Novell compatability is) inexpensively
      (<$100 please, << better - used ok so long as working) so I can set up
      a permanent test site, please let me know: padgett@tccslr.dnet.mmc.com

I'm not sure what you mean by exhaustive test, but I think that if you
review your test results again, you will find the following:

1. There is a clear distinction between NetWare RIGHTS and ATTRIBUTES.
Attributes are an emulation and an extension of regular DOS file
attributes.  Rights are NetWare's own security implementation.

2. Viruses cannot directly alter _ASSIGNED EFFECTIVE RIGHTS_.  Rights
security controls which directories, subdirectories and files a user
can access and what the user is allowed to do with them.  Rights
Security supersedes attribute security, in that a user must first be
given access to a directory, subdirectory or file before attributes
can be defined for each.

3. The Supervisory right overrides any restrictions placed on
subdirectories or files with an _INHERITED RIGHTS MASK_.  Use of the
Supervisory right will directly contribute to virus propagation when
assigned independently, or in conjunction with any other combination
of rights.

4. A virus which has Read, Write and File Scan rights, can infect
target files.  Therfore careful consideration should be given to use
of the Write right.

5. In addition to the basic attributes of Archive, Read Only, System
and Hidden, NetWare adds several other attributes to extend the
limitations of DOS attributes.  NetWare attributes are less effective
against viral infection because of NetWare's excellent emulation of
DOS.  All DOS attributes can be changed by viruses.  Only one
attribute does not seem to be emulated exactly by NetWare.  This is
the System attribute.  Use of the System attribute prohibits viral
infection.  The only other attribute which stops viral infection, out
of the _18_ NetWare attributes is the Execute Only attribute.

Because of the risk of Supervisor privilege misuse, Network
administrators should not rely 100% on NetWare for protection.
However, IMHO, careful assignment of rights will provide a better
protection against virus propagation than no protection at all.
Careful management of NetWare rights combined with an integrity check
at login time will go a long way to keeping a LAN clean.

I encourage Mr. Cohen to redesign his tests with a better
understanding of Rights and Attributes.  If your basic theory is to
prove that NetWare Attributes are not effective against viruses, you
will essentially be correct, however if your basic theory is that
NetWare Rights are not effective against viruses, then you will, in
general, be incorrect.

I believe that if you reread the red books, you will find that they
are correct their description of inheritance.

Subject: Datalision Inc fractal program (PC)

     Dear People,

     Being into fractals and all I get lots of fractal disks
in the mail from would be fractal types.  A few years
back I got a disk called MANJU87 from a company called
DATALISION PULISHERS, INC.  New York 10017.

     Now the fractals on this disk were pretty nice, but the program
was a joke, and failed to function so many times I took to playing
frisbee with the disk.  Further it forced you to enter a password
everytime you wanted to use the program.  I used CSHOW to look at the
images.

     Anyhow a few weeks ago I got around to installing it for
the first time to see what the competition was like.
A few days later I found my hard disk will missing 16 million bytes
in 8110 lost clusters!

     I got a bit frantic wondering what the hell it was, until I
remembered the competency with which manju was pieced together.  I
fixed my disk with pctools and reinstalled manju87 and lo and behold
8110 lost clusters.

     What is this joker doing anyhow?  Besides placing a hidden file
in my root directory named !_235053 which was filled with sniblets of
random files on my disk, how did he manage to lose that many clusters
and cross allocate files in my fat to the point where pctools just
gave us and went to the mirror file?

    Anyhow I haven't contacted the people who put this thing out yet,
I am having too much fun playing frisbee with their disk, but I have
a mind to, except that they are probably long gone and should be.

     Besides their ENGLISH in the documentation was terminal, some
people just don't know how they come across with their broken english.
especially on the jacket of a product touting itself to be the
world reference for fractals, and demanding level 10 security
clearance to use the disk.

     Have a nice day.

     Homer

I guess an integrity checker could limit the spread and warn of the
presence, but not stop a virus-infected program being put onto the
system.

If the change detector uses standard DOS calls (or even BIOS) then it
stands to get fooled.  But it doesn't have to. As for an integrity
checker doing its thing as part of the program execute sequence, it is
a good idea to use this in conjunction with other anti-viral
precautions, e.g. ones that check whether important BIOS and DOS
vectors have changed. There is still a way a virus can get around
this, but it is difficult, and requires the virus know about the
particular change detector that is running.  And viruses that go to
such an extent will be obvious to other, elementary, change detectors
(e.g. ones that simply look for changes to particular parts of system
memory).

Subject: Bug in F-PROT? (PC)

I was using F-PROT 2.04c from a bootable DOS 5.0 diskette.  After
booting from the A: drive, I wanted to scan another diskette in the A:
drive.  F-PROT produced unintelligible messages, such as "cotaaly
tanmcyng, ico staro%Nnurta...".  Another user here reported the same
phenomenon.  Does anyone have an explanation and/or fix for this
problem?

Subject: Fingerprinting self-modifying files

Is there general agreement that fingerprinting files with a relaible
method is the most foolproof way of detecting virus infection ?

How would one apply this technique to some programs that modify their
disk-images ?

Does the MS-Windows distribution contain any such binary files that
are self-modifying ?

Subject: Misunderstanding of polymorphic

(I know that there was a message saying that no further rumors about
Aliens 4 would be posted.)

I read the intial bulletin and the later follow-up elsewhere, and it
seems fairly likely that no new virus was involved. (False alarms from
old software, multiple infections by common viruses and non-virus
related problems seem like plausable explainations, though one can
never prove absolutely a negative.)

It seems that the originator of the reports is (still) unclear about
how a polymorphic virus will behave.  I am concerned that this
misconception not be spread further.

In my understanding, it is not particularly likely that a polymorphic
virus would trigger scanners in such a way that it would look like two
different existing viruses.

A new polymorphic virus is most likely to "look" to scanners like a
series of unknown viruses (which may well not be detected by scanners
at all on this account).

A polymorphic virus with code derived from an existing virus might at
times look like that virus -- but it is wildly unlikely that it would
resemble two unrelated viruses.

This looks like a canditate for a developing virus "urban myth".

                        (c) Brain - part 3

I have mentioned Alan Solomon's analysis of the Brain family with
regard to the dating of the ashar variant.  Fridrik Skulason
performed a similar analysis of the Ohio and Den Zuk versions, and
has been proven 100% correct in his conclusions.

The Ohio and Den Zuk variants contain the Brain identification code,
and so will not be "infected" or overlaid by Brain.  However, Ohio
and Den Zuk identify Brain infections, and will replace Brain
infections with themselves.  Thus, Ohio and Den Zuk may be said to
be agents acting against the Brain virus (at the expense, however,
of having the Ohio and Den Zuk infections).  frisk also found that
the Den Zuk version preferentially overlaid Ohio.  (This "seeking"
activity gives rise to one of Den Zuk's aliases: "Search".  It was
also suspected that "denzuko" might have referred to "the search"
for Brain infections.  This turned out not to be the case.)

There is text in both strains which indicates a similarity of
authorship.  Ohio contains an address in Indonesia, both contain a
ham radio licence number issued in Indonesia.  Both contain the
identical bug which overlays FAT and data areas on non-360K format
disks.  Den Zuk has the more sophisticated touches in programming.
>From all of this, frisk concluded that Ohio was, in fact, an earlier
version of Den Zuk.

So it proved to be, in a message from the author.  The author turns
out to have been a college student in Indonesia who, to this day,
sees nothing wrong with what he did.  (On the contrary, he is
inordinately proud of it, and is somewhat peeved that his earlier
creation is "misnamed" Ohio: he's never been there.  The name of
Ohio was given by McAfee in reference to the place of the first
identification of the viral program: Ohio State University.)  Den
Zuko is his nickname, derived from John Travolta's character in the
movie "Grease".

Full details of Fridrik's analysis and his contact with the author
are available in Fridrik's article in the Virus Bulletin.

Subject: I'm off [to Scotland]...

I just released a new version of F-PROT (2.05), and now I'm off for
the virus conference in Scotland.  I will be taking my yearly one-week
vacation [no :-) here, unfortunately] right after the conference, and
will not be back until September 13th.

My apologies to those which have sent me E-mail recently that I have
not been able to reply to - I have 400 messages waiting for a reply
and they will probably be around 800 when I get back.

If anybody absolutely has to get in contact with me personally during
this time, just send a fax to +354-1-28801 - my staff will know how to
