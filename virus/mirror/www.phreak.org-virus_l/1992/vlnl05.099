VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  (The complete set of posting guidelines is available by
FTP on cert.sei.cmu.edu or upon request.)  Please sign submissions
with your real name.  Send contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU
(that's equivalent to VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).
Information on accessing anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue
archives is distributed periodically on the list.  Administrative mail
(comments, suggestions, and so forth) should be sent to me at:
krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: More administrivia, when it rains it pours

As I'm sure you're all aware, the last couple VIRUS-L digests, Volume
5 Issues 96-98, were sent out twice by the LISTSERV@ibm1.cc.lehigh.edu,
despite the fact that I only sent them once...

Simultaneously, a recipient site had a problem with a mailer which
caused the mailer to send me some 2000+ bounced e-mail messages
starting Friday afternoon (right after the site's administrators left
for the weekend).  Each bounced message contained a complete digest,
which filled up my spool disk space a few times over the weekend...
Speaking of which, it is not impossible that I inadvertantly killed
some V-L submissions over the weekend, in my attempt to keep up with
the incoming bounced mail.

Simultaneously, a vacation program ran amok and got into an infinite
discussion with the LISTSERV.  ("Thank you for the submission"..."I'm
not in right now"...Sigh!)  Oh, to be a moderator...  :-\

Hopefully, all of these problems are now sorted out, although I'm not
entirely sure about the duplicates, since there is not enough
information in the duplicated issue to know for certain which site
generated it.  We'll find out with this issue, won't we?  (Perhaps I
should offer an unformatted disk to the net.gods...:-)

As cheerfully as I can muster,

   It was my personal bias against some setups that caused that response.
VDS 2.10 works even under MS Windows 3.1 without shelling out to DOS,
though we recommend it. The other day, one of our associates (advocate of
Win30) showed me the books on the shelves of a local book store's computers
section. Almost 1/3 was Windows stuff!  It's catching on fast. I still do
not like Windows personally, but you're right, compatibility is
very important.

   Hmm. It should've displayed a message and then aborted, not hung up.
Was it on a PS/2 by any chance?

   Okay. After all, that's the reason there's a trial version so that
people can choose whether VDS works on their systems first.

   Not exactly partition-dependent. Let me put it this way. The device
driver tries to determine if the MBR, BR, etc. are modified. If so, it puts
a copy of the affected area in a file for further examination, then
attempts to recover. If only the partition table is modified but not the
code, it will warn that it was not properly installed on that system. Of
course, this will miss an indirect BSI that only modifies the active
partitions entry. But it will be caught on the second pass which checks the
BR. The device driver actually gets the partition entry from the table in
MBR, so it can handle such a case.
   VDS.EXE is a little smarter. It actually tries to determine if the
partition sector matches the disk layout as indicated in the backup copy
of the MBR. If not, it does NOT attempt to recover, to avoid such damage,
and only posts a warning message.

   I disagree. The documentation tries to promote a sensible approach to
anti-viral security. It does not overemphasize the problem, not does it
underestimate it.

  Your example of people switching to VAXes because they had a bad
experience with a PC virus was not realistic. It is usually the case that
they deal with the problem by running a scanner/cleaner (or even
formatting their drives), and then forget about it. This behavior still
puts them in Category 3 (4 is the highest risk), unless they did take a
more reasonable approach to protect their PCs.

   It is more than that. It tries to give unexposed users an idea about
such beasts. The concentration in that section is not whether VDS bypasses
everything or not (though this is mentioned :-)).

   Such idealistic usage is not common. So we gotto do the next best
thing: try to come up with something that is secure enough even when run
from the hard disk, even when there's a stealth beast in memory.

   It is not that simple. People are not willing to boot from a floppy all
the time. Cohen has a funny suggestion in his Bootstrapping paper about a
snapshot of memory state saved on a write-protected floppy. Theoretically,
it may be feasible, but in practice it won't work well. If it is not used,
what good is it? Kind of like discretionary access control :-)

   It'd better be honest about it; 'cause it is a simple variation on
Frodo's way of doing business :-)) Okay, I take that back.

   Looking forward to it. I'm sure we shall all learn from it.

   Let's get serious. Scanners do the same? It takes a minor hack to
outdate the niftiest one. We are concentrating on large scale/long term
solutions. Remember Cohen's cost formulas?

   In the bigger scheme of things, it is trivial as far as the threat it
might pose is concerned. Exceptions again.

   No, Vesselin, no. We operate quite differently. I'll describe it in
private if you are interested.

Of course, for the future this may very well change. Please let's not
argue what is special what is not. We are not getting anywhere.

   This is not correct. Memory protection is a different issue, and it
would allow us to accomplish many other things, but the implementation
overhead is too much. Anyway, it seems that we mean something different
when we say "bypassing stealth viruses". I cannot discuss this here to
protect the innocent :-)

   Any stealth virus? Well, you are contradicting yourself in principle. So
what is that magic quality that makes UT catch all stealth viruses? I
have reports from people who forgot to activate the memory resident
component of UT and ended up infecting most of their programs as the
integrity checker component did its miracle. BTW, this was not a stealth
virus, just a hacked version of Datalock. Of course, UT told her each
infected program failed the check (after causing infection)! It seems that
they should have combined at least some of the robust features of the
resident component into the integrity checker. "That's not how the manual
wants you to use it" approach is not sufficient. I have not seen their
latest release, maybe they rectified this deficiency. If you want to
maximize compatibility at the cost of less security, Integrity Master is a
better choice at a fraction of the cost. Similar flaws, but better
implemented, not as sharp-looking. Just my personal opinion.

   DR DOS and non-DOS partitions are taken care of. Compressed disks will
wait for a future release. In LAN environments, VDS integrity checker is
the best way to control virus entry points. It will not work on the
servers. Suspicious ability? You are underestimating its operation ;-)

   Please let's provide some evidence, not just opinions, though they are
welcomed in principle.

   You are missing the point. Decoys are meant to catch memory resident
viruses that attack upon file access. Let's not apply irrelevant criteria.
If we claim to catch non-resident viruses with decoys, that would be magic!

  Your memory must be failing you lately :-) Again, irrelevant criteria.

  I really would like to see this. I had a similar report from Mike in
Virginia. He got it to infect on a 20M disk somehow. During our tests,
Starship simply goes to no-man's land. It is too paranoid. Or maybe it
makes wrong assumptions about the hard drive. I need to disassemble it one
of those days. Does the hard drive parameters really matter? Any info will
be appreciated, sir.

  Wait a minute. Are we talking about the integrity checker component or
the scanner of UT? Why does the integrity checker rely on a virus being
known? Didn't you say above even good virus scanners do the same? I
thought UT's claims are for the integrity checker portion. Please clarify.

  That was our initial approach; then we modified it not to confuse people.

   An old way to speed things up. Yes, even I used to use it. Now the PCs
are fast enough not to notice such speed differences. I agree that the
assumption C:\COMMAND.COM is too restrictive. It should be default and then
installation should try to determine the actual one. Let me pass it on to
the boys one more time.

   Yes. Cohen has been harping on that theme for some time now. And he's
quite right. Many LANs are so vulnerable, it's scary. Infect a common app,
then let the supervisor run it! No need for privilidged access. The thing
is I would like to see some plausible solutions, or at least attempts to
provide a reasonable approach. Alas, I am at a loss.

It's not compilers that create executables, it's linkers.  And I don't
think you don't have to look that far to find a program that does a
create and then writes; the DOS command COPY does just that when it
copies a file.  So this virus isn't trying to infect only things that
are newly compiled; I think it is just infecting anything that's
copied onto a floppy in the usual way...  DC

Ooops, sorry, I submitted incorrect information. Jan Terpstra has

You are right. TbScan has many other bugs, which cause it to not
always detect the signatures that are listed in the signature file.
The main reason for the bugs is that the scanner tries to be too smart
and to trace the virus entry point with a built-in debugger. It is
indeed extremely fast, but most people need a scanner that finds
viruses, not one that can traverse the directory tree faster than any
other... :-) As opposed to TbScan, HTScan plainly scans the whole
file, without doing any tricks. (Well, in fact, it does use one trick
- - the Boyer-Moor fast string searching algorithm.) HTScan is roughly
three times slower than TBScan, but does exactly what it is supposed
to do.

The possibility to write a virus which forges CRCs has been discussed
a lot about four years ago, but it was before the stealth file
infectors appeared... I'm surprised that people still seem to ignore

Indeed. Mr. Nelson is also wrong is several other obvious ways. For
instance, a virus does not necessarily increase the file size, even if
it is not active in memory (Number of the Beast, 1963, Zero Hunter,
Lehigh, Darth Vader, Int13, etc.). Also, it does not need to "add new
bytes" in order to preserve the file's CRC. I have seen a program
which used to modify COMMAND.COM in such a way that it prints the
message "FluShot is silly. Press any key" and wait for a keypress when
executed. All this without modifying the file's size, date, time, or
checksum. The checksum method that has been targetted by this program
was the method used by FluShot+, which is not a CRC, but the same can
be done for a CRC-based checksum.

Oh, in fact the stealth file infectors have been created to attack
exactly integrity checkers, just as the fast infectors have been
created to attack scanners and the tunneling viruses have been created
to attack monitoring programs. The historically first stealth file
infector (The Number of the Beast) appeared in Sofia soon after a
speech of mine about the virus prevention techniques, which stressed
that the integrity checkers are the strongest line of defense... :-)

Besides, there are other possible kinds of attack against the
integrity checkers.

Correct. Unfortunately, there's no way to establish such a secure
channel without hardware-supported memory protection.

Yes, but they have to be implemented correctly, and to be aware of
some methods that can be used by the viruses to attack them. Also,
there should no way for the virus to deduce the polinomial on which
the CRC is based, in order to prevent the CRC-forging based attacks.
Yisrael Radai has published several excellent papers on this subject.

Under MS/PC DOS it is even impossible, since to memory protection

Yes, this is the only secure way to make sure that there's no virus in
memory when the integrity checker is being run. Unfortunately, most
users find this requirement to be too inconveniencing...

Subject: (Primative ?) Question

I have been on this list for a few weeks and have learned a GREAT
deal. --Thank you all thus far!-- I am still not versed enough in this
area (jargon, definitions, history, etc.) to ask anything 'earth
shattering', but one question has been lingering in my mind. If it
seems trivial to some, please excuse a beginner's innocence. 8^)

Is there any known cases of 'hackers' or those involved in computer
crimes who have dissected one or more anti-viral programs (from the
most basic to the most complex) to find out how they could make a
virus 'fool', 'trick', 'avoid', etc. that particular checker? If so,
what burdens has that placed on those who develop anti-viral programs?
If not, is this a consideration that anti-viral developers place into
their products anyway? (That is, has this avenue been considered by
anti-viral groups and steps taken to protect/secure the 'hacker' from
finding out, or at least make it very difficult, to see what makes the
anti-viral product 'tick'?)

Subject: Embedding Codes

In reply to John Parks about embedding code into documents and them
making documents containing code, this is absolutely impossible. OLE
documents contain ONLY reference to the application whichi created it.
If the application is not there, because the document has been copied
to somebody else's machine, Windows, will simply say that it can't
open it.

After talking with tech people from MS in Redmond, WA, they
confirmed that.

About viruses into Windows programs, this is rare enough yet.  usual
DOS-based viruses cannot easily live inside Windows because of its
memory management. Also, the viruses spread based on DOS executable
format files. A Windows application infected by a virus would not be
executable anymore under Windows. That could cause unpredictable
results, but no more infection. TrueType fonts, when created are made
in to an executable file. When using such fonts into a document, those
fonts are integral part of the document so somebody else can at least
print them. Although those fonts are from an executable file, they
cannot contain a virus.  The document could get damaged, but nothing
else

Interesting!  You want to collect unbiased opinions about X, and so
you're asking for everyone to tell you why X is bad?  That sounds a
little biased to me...  *8)

Just kidding; I understand your point.  It's important to note,
though, that when Dr. Cohen talks about beneficial viruses, he
*doesn't* mean what most of us mean when we talk about viruses.  He
means anything at all that replicates in any sense.  We, in normal
VIRUS-L talk, mean programs designed to replicate across systems
without the knowledge or consent of the system owner.

Dr. Cohen's papers on "good viruses" will make much more sense, and be
much less controversial, if you read something like "artificial
replicator" when he says "virus".  People working in the artificial
life field talk about beneficient uses of replicators all the time
without anyone objecting.  The key difference is that the unstated
assumption there is that the replicators stay inside their
experimenter-controlled artificial world.  The assumption when we on
VIRUS-L use the word "virus" is that the replicators are a kind that
can escape.

I have created systems in which artificial replicators did interesting
things, and I feel no guilt for having done it!  While they were
probably viruses in Cohen's sense, they were *not* viruses in the
sense we use on VIRUS-L; there's no way they could have gotten outside
the artificial world in which they were created.

	why waste the time if there are no arguments given why this
	should be considered a "good idea"? (There are none?  well,
	we are done then already...)

	There is no such thing as a "good virus"; your (pro-)position
	is flawed (ill thought out?) in that you are using the terms
	"virus techniques" and "useful" without explanation.  You may
	be thinking of "the intention justifies the means", but
	that is a dangerous line of thought, and experiments along
	that line are likely to see you in disrepute (and in some
	countries, in court).

	a virus is like a visitor who neither announces himself
	nor asks permission.  How would you like me to surreptitiously
	scan all your (private) correspondence?  reason: to correct
	your English/German spelling and grammar.  (I dislike
	analogies, but they do help to make a point sometimes).

	We are all executing lots of code on our computers about
	the purpose and function (details) we know little, and
	which often enough does "unexpected" things (a bug is
	just another kind of virus).  For example, we are using
	anti-virus scanners which modify virus-infected (or suspected)
	files 'on the fly'; when "a mistake" happens, we will not
	be happy, but we will 'understand' to a certain extent;
	however, if someone's "friendly virus" had installed itself
	into my system "to look out for me," and was the cause of
	wrecking my files, a simple "oops, I meant well" won't do.

			     -----------

	What you probably want to do is to define "positive goals"
	that one might want to achieve with programming techniques
	that are "virus-like", but my advice would be to avoid the
	term "virus" completely; leave it alone as a term with negative
	connotations unquestioned...

	have you ever heard of a human immunization that spreads
	"virus-like"?  I haven't, but even if it was possible, who
	would/should take the responsibility to consider the whole
	world as their private laboratory...?!?

Here's an idea (to change the subject).  What kind of protective
measures can you think of provided that you can put code in ROM? (Or
better yet, EEROM--with a hardware "write enable" switch)?

I was thinking that maybe someone could devise an anti-virus card with
some ROM on it that can be activated via an OUT instruction or a
direct CALL to ROM.  There is no way a virus can hook into it (and
therefore circumvent the analysis).  Some problems do come to mind
(platform and operating system dependency, etc.) but I am sure the
mere fact that such a card could provide a completely trustworthy
execution of code that it could be of great advantage to an anti-virus
developer.

And such a device could be very inexpensive.

What utility could be made of this?

Flame on!

           Hello!!  everybody:

      We are a group of students of Computer  Systems Engineering at  ITESO
University, in Guadalajara Mexico. Each year a symposium of subjects, items
and tutorials related  to  our  studies  is  organized  by students of this
career, supported by our University, Corporations and Institutes (like IEEE
of Mexico) to make it possible, and this year is our turn.

      With this goal, we are  using  this media to get in touch with people
related to or interested in computers,  to  ask  them  for some help and/or
support  in  contacting  conferencists   or  people  that  give  tutorials.
The topics that we are focused in are :

      * Multimedia                       * Networks
      * Virus                            * CASE Tools
      * OOP                              * Unix
      * Etc..

      This event will take place in Guadalajara, Mexico from September 21 to
25 of the present Year.

      If you want  to  help  us  or  you  know someone that would and could,
please contact us.

      Thank you in advance for your atention and colaboration.
