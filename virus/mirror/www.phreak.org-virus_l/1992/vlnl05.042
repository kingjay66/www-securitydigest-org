I had a very similar occurence on one of my machines.  Several files
changed sizes, and several EXEs and PIFs were prepended with trash.
The cause was traced to the use of Disk Technician Gold's
defragmentation utility.  Apparently it doesn't get along well with
all systems.  (No, I didn't defrag under Windows!)

You are right to conclude that:

1) CPAV uses for some viruses the same scan strings as SCAN;

2) CPAV makes no effort to ecrypt (even trivially) those scan strings
neither on the disk, nor in memory;

3) SCAN does not actually check the memory for viruses (where they
should be); it just scans it for scan strings.

While (1) is not a big problem, (2) means that CPAV is -really-
stupid, and (3) means that SCAN is only moterately stupid. :-)

Neither of the above. On March 6 the Michelangelo virus will overwrite
the disk(ette) it has been booted from with that happens to be in
memory from address 5000:0000h (probably zeroes). It will overwrite
tracks 0 to 255, sides 0 to 3. The range of the sectors overwritten
depends on the disk: it is sectors 1-9 for 360 Kb 5.25" floppies, 1-17
for hard disks, 1-14 for everything else.

Due to a bug in the virus, it will not stop after reaching track 255,
but will go back to track 0 and so on ad infinitum.

Please, note also that this will make an infected system diskette
non-bootable, while disinfecting it with a virus-specific program
might (in most, but not all) cases preserve bootability...

Hmmm.... There is a virus, called Form (not Forms), which activates on
24th (not 23rd) on every month, but as far as I remember, it does
something with the speaker and does not trash files...

Several viruses infect non-executable files, not in order to hide, but
simply due to bugs. One of the notorious ones is Frodo.

Remember, in order to get infected, you must execute the virus code.
How often do you execute .DOC files?

Therefore, your anti-virus program is a so-called Monitorig program.
It is a TSR, which monitors disk access and expects to catch any virus
activity, like updating executable code.

Well, sorry to disappoint you, but such programs offer virtually -no-
protection. Not just your program - any programs of this type. First,
they are useless against boot and master boot sector infectors, and
next, they can be trivially bypassed or deactivated by a virus.

Right, FluShot+ is a monitor. It offers no serious protection against
the modern virus technology. Just like your program.

I haven't seen your program, so I cannot decide how comprehensive it
is, but it provides NO protection against most modern viruses.

Nope. The virus installs itself in memory before your program. It
intercepts the interrupt vectors before your program. It receives
control -after- your program, and unless it is buggy (like most
viruses are), you have no way to intercept its activities.

It is almost useless against MBR infectors. Remember, such viruses
load in memory before DOS, they infect the physical hard disk, not a
logical partition, and they are using BIOS calls. Regardless what you
have installed in the MBR, it can "hide" the disk only from DOS, there
is no way to hide it from the BIOS. Well, of course, you could
indicate via the CMOS setup (if you have such thing) that there is no
hard disk in the system, but this is another story.

Right, programs like FIXMBR provide signifficant protection against
such viruses.

Forget it. It does its "protection" by simply intercepting INT 13h and
therefore is just crap, since it can be easily bypassed by most modern
viruses.

Greetings:

had a strange problem today.  I found an infected 5.25 inch 360 KB
floppy infected with the Ohio virus.  I tried to clean it with
McAfee's Clean-up version 86B and it recognized the virus but could

Yet another report that CLEAN is sometimes damaging disks when
removing Michelangelo... Obviously the people at McAfee Associates

Yes. FDISK /MBR removes any MBR infector. Unfortunately, only FDISK
that comes with DOS 5.0 can do that, but fortunately, it works even if
the hard disk has an older DOS version.

This virus -cannot- spread through the network. It is a master boot
sector infector. Only file infecting viruses can sometimes (not
always) spread though a LAN.

AT&T DOS 2.11 does not support argv[0], the location in which the
executable was found.  A change directory to fprot's directory prior
to execution should take care of this problem.

The only way I know around this (from the author's point of view) is
to allow the executable to modify itself to embed the necessary path
information.  This is undesirable for a number of obvious reasons; you
are right, the only good answer is to get the BIOS upgrade and run DOS
3 or higher.  :-(

Perfectly right. With one exception - some XTs (called "Turbo XTs")
also support INT 1Ah.

Not exact. The virus can infect floppies of any size, but it checks
any disk being accessed, and if it is not in drive A: (physical drive
00h), the virus does not infect it.

No, the disk drive size has nothing to do with the infectablility.

Do you think so? I got the impression that the current population of
ATs and above already outnumbers the population of XTs...

I do not depend on the oppinions of people I am asking, when the
matter is so sensitive. What I wrote was based on what I -know-, not
on what I have heard. We (the VTC-Hamburg) have only 4 different Den
Zuk viruses in our virus collection. Our virus collection is combined
from the virus collections of:

	- Laboratory of Computer Virology, Sofia
	- Virus Test Center, Hamburg (prior to August 1st, 1991)
	- Fridrik Skulason
	- Dr. Alan Solomon
	- John McAfee
	- Central Point Software
	- Andrzej Kadlof (Poland)
	- Certus
	- NCSA

Some of the people mentioned above have not send us updates for some
time, but nevertheless, the whole thing is pretty impressive. The
whole thing occupies about 1600 directories, 3100 executable files,
about 60 Mb disk space...  It contains about 1200 (slightly less)
different virus variants. New viruses are received literally every day.

We consider two virus variants as being different, if they differ by
at least one bit in their non-variable-data areas. For instance, we
count 2 variants for Disk Killer, although they differ only by one
ASCII character.

> based my count on information from a major antivirus software author.

Have in mind that the anti-virus software vendors have interest to
report that their programs can detect more viruses. I know about at
least one product, which counts viruses that are able to infect both
COM and EXE files as two different viruses. We are not selling
anti-virus programs; we are a non-profit research institution, so I am
interested in the -truth-, not in reporting as many viruses as
possible. I might be mistaken, of course, so if you happen to know
about any Ohio or other Den Zuk variant that we don't know, we'll
appreciate a copy of it.

This question may have been asked/answered already, but does merely
setting the system date ahead on the 5th (to the 7th) cause the
trigger mechanism never to go off?

It would seem that if true, as an interim measure until all systems
could be scanned, that the systems just be set so that Friday, the 6th
of March never comes....

For sure none of the currently existing viruses will bypass this
protection. The hard disk is not accessible even throuth BIOS calls.
However, I will not take the responsability to state that it is really
impossible to access the disk and that no future virus will be able to
do that. Note that in this case my reaction ("who knows, might be
possible") is caused mainly because I am not informated well enough
(read: ignorant) on this (hardware) matter.

Any comments from the more knowledgeable people are welcome. Is it
possible to access the hard disk (maybe through the ports) if the CMOS
says "no hard disk available"?

Vesselin

Subject: Verbatim Disks & Michaelangelo (PC)

Can anyone confirm or deny the presence of Michaelangelo on
preformatted Verbatim floppy disks?

I have a student who came into my office today with Michaelangelo
on a 1.2 MB preformatted Verbatim Disk that she says she took out
of a cellophane wrapped box today, and it is infected.  She has
gone home to get me the rest of the box, and to run SCAN on the
hard drive of her home machine, which is the only machine she has
used it in.

She claims she never uses disks from anywhere else on her home machine.

Someone mentioned that they had had a similar experience in the VIRUS-L
Digest, but I never saw a confirmation or an official statement by
Verbatim.

Please call if you have any information, or reply at the above address.

(BTW, McAfee's VSHIELD has thwarted two attempts of Michaelangelo on
 campus so far.  One of the machines was infected by a cold boot, but
 was discovered on the next boot of the machine.  The other machine was
 not allowed to Warm boot from Michaelangelo disk.)

Subject: Michaelangelo follow-up (PC)

Yesterday I posted a question regarding VERBATIM disks and
Michaelangelo.  Since then I have been contacted by Verbatim, and
informed that it is "utterly impossible" that pre-formatted Verbatim
disks contain the Michaelangelo virus.  They are formatted from a UNIX
based machine, that does some sort of high-speed binary format that is
supposedly totally unrelated to DOS and thus could not carry this
DOS-based boot sector virus.

Also, taking my sample of Michaelangelo, on a 1.2MB disk, I made my
1.2MB my A: drive and infected my hard drive.  Then I made my 1.44MB
drive A: and attempted to infect a 720K and a 1.44MB floppy in the A:
drive of an infected machine for over 3 hours last night.  I formatted
the 720K in the infected machine, copied files to it, saved a
wordperfect document to it, deleted files on it, and generally wore it
out.  I was unable to infect the floppy.  When I formatted the 1.44 MB
disk in drive A: it was unreadable.  I formatted it without incident
on another machine and again, I got the "general failure reading drive
A: abort retry or fail" message, when I tried to read anything from it
on the Michaelangelo machine.  Taking it back to the first machine, it
was also unreadable.  Almost as if infecting it makes it unreadable by
DOS.  (This was MS-DOS 5.0).  I removed Michaelangelo from the hard
drive, rebooted, and had no problems formatting, reading, and writing
to the 1.44MB disk.  I then swapped my A and B drives (via
ribbon cable) and booted again from my infected 1.2MB.  The hard drive
was once more infected.  I then rebooted, and did a DIR A: on a clean
disk.  Presto!  My 5.25" disk was infected by a DIR command, while my
3.5" could not be infected.  Period.  On drive A:.

I have noticed a comment of a similar nature in today's VIRUS-L.
Could one of our "virus experts" make comment?

Also, when I have infected machines that are running Zenith DOS 3.3+,
I have been unable to infect a machine "properly".  Instead, the
Michaelangelo virus goes on the hard drive and corrupts the partition
table, making the drive unbootable.  (Booting from drive A: and using
McAfee's CLEAN removes the virus, but still leaves Drive C:
unbootable.  Norton fixed that.) One of the machines was a Zenith 386,
the other was an IBM AT (running Zenith DOS).

Lastly, I don't believe my IBM PCs on campus are going to trigger on March 6,
even if they are infected.  I am going now to test that.  (by infecting one
and making it March 6 and seeing what happens.)  The date on my PCs on campus
is Jan 1 1980, until the user tells it otherwise, which would already be after
the trigger date.

I am rather urgent to find out about this.  Currently our computer
labs are protected with VSHIELD, but none of the other computers on
campus are protected at all.  I have the opportunity, if I can
convince management that there is "grave risk" to buy anti-virus
software every machine on campus.  At this point, I can't say that
I believe we are at "grave risk" from Michaelangelo, despite the fact
that I have seen it on two floppies on my own campus!   My PS/2s, ALRs and
Zenith 286/386 machines all have 3.5" A: drives, most of my PCs don't have
internal clocks, which leaves me with a bunch of Zenith 159 machines as my
primary concern, and a few scattered clones.

Please respond ASAP with information regarding:

    can a 3.5" be accidentally infected?
    has the virus been seen/shipped on 3.5" diskettes?
    can Zenith DOS 3.3+ machines spread the virus?
    can an IBM PC, with an internal clock trigger the virus?
    can an IBM PC without an internal clock?  (I don't think so).

Thanks for your timely replies.  I realize the danger of this virus,
but I think there is an equal danger of getting our virus information
from CNN and allowing ourselves to be stirred into a panic by the
media, and people who will profit from our virus scare.  (No offense
intended to any virus software vendors reading this, many of whom are
giving free use of their software because they care about our data
safety.)  I think a lot of us are letting ourselves spread second hand
information.  I know I have (some guy from San Jose called for a newspaper
interview, where I dutifully reported what information I had gathered from
my second hand sources.  I now regret it.)

Subject: Virus Calendar

First, my apologies to UK readers who may have already seen this message.

I am compiling a 'calendar' of signifcant dates with respect to PC
viruses.  I figured that this could be a handy tool in helping to
prepare for possible outbreaks.  the response so far from the UK has
been good with people sending both dates, and requests for the
finished list.

If you have dates, please send them to me direct at:-

	ROY@UK.AC.LIVERPOOL.ME.MVAX1

and I'll post the finished calendar back to VIRUS-L

Many thanks,

No way. Can't be done.

Right. LapLink requires the user to use the CTTY COMx command, in
order to transfer itself to the remote machine. (That is, the CTTY
command has to by issued by the operator on the remote machine.)
