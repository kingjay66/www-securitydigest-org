They have one of the best scanners (our tests show that it has the
third best detection rate). However, I wouldn't rely on their
disinfector. In fact, I wouldn't rely on any disinfector -
disinfecting viruses is a bad idea and should be avoided. Replace the
infected objects with clean originals instead.

Anyway, if you -must- disinfect, try F-Prot 2.02d (extremely cheap
shareware), or Dr. Solomon's Anti-Virus ToolKit (commercial).

Even better - don't rely on known-virus scanning/removal only. Use
multiple levels of virus protection, with accent to integrity
checkers.

Indeed, there are some silly software products that do something
similar and claim to disable access to the hard disk. Unfortunately,
they are trivial to bypass (unless they use some kind of encryption)
and most MBR viruses infect such "protected" disks without any
problems.

It is undocumented... :-) But it works.

No, to my knowledge. Anybody from IBM who can supply more information?

Right, on September 22 or later any year, the virus will hang the
infected systems, when a GetDOSVersion function call is executed.

The virus is stealth, which means that if it is active in memory, the
infected files look as if they are not infected. That's why you must
always boot from a non-infected write-protected system diskette before
checking for viruses. The virus is quite well known and most good
virus scanners are able to detect it.

Aarrgh... When is the FAQ list comming out?... :-) This is at least
the fourth time this month I am answering a question like this...

Anyway, here's the answer. Every formatted diskette contains a boot
sector, regardless whether it is a bootable diskette (i.e., contains
the DOS files), or contains only files, or contains only data files,
or is just empty.

The boot sector contains a program, the task of which is to locate the
DOS files and to load them, or to print the message "Non-system disk,
replace and strike any key" if these files are not present.

Computer viruses infect programs. Since every formatted diskette
contains a boot sector, and every boot sector contains a program, this
means that at least some viruses can infect any formatted diskette.
Stoned is such virus.

> files copied to it. How are viruses transferred via non-bootable

The virus overwrites the boot sector with its body and moves the
original boot program somewhere else. (In this particular case - to
what it believes is the last sector of the root directory.) If you
forget such diskette in your A: drive when you turn your machine one,
the boot sector (containing the virus) will be read by the BIOS and
control will be transfered to it. The virus will install itself in
memory, infect the hard disk, load the original boot sector, and
transfer control to it. If the original boot sector fails to find the
DOS files on the diskette, the boot will fail, but your hard disk will
be infected anyway. The next time you boot from the infected hard
disk, the virus will install itself in memory and infect any non-write
protected diskette accessed in drive A:.

No, you will not infect your computer, but you will produce an
infected copy. Better use COPY or XCOPY to copy the files only.

You don't risk to get infected unless you try to boot from the
infected diskette.

Sorry, I was not available during the last week, since I was in
Israel.

At the VTC-Hamburg we received about 18,000 empty diskettes with
request for our free anti-Michelangelo program. They were all scanned
and some of them turned out to be not so empty... About 1.5 % of them
we infected - by Stoned, Michelangelo,  Form...

On March 6 I was in Israel, so I do not know about any reports for
destructions in Germany. In Israel they set a voice mailbox for
reporting destructions, caused by the virus. There were at least 24
confirmed reports - about destructions, not just infections.

One person has found the virus on his computer a few days before the
doom date. He has removed it, but the computer developped a hardware
failure. He sent the computer to the repair shop, but forgot to scan
it when he received it back. Guess what happened when he turned the
machine on on March 6...

Oh, F-DLOCK is much more clever than that... It garbles some of the
BIOS information about the hard disk, so it seems that no hard disk is
present. If a legitimate program tries to read from the disk (using
INT 13h), F-DLOCK will intercept that, and will temporary restore the
necessary BIOS data. If a virus bypasses F-DLOCK, it will just find
out that no hard disk is present.

Unfortunately, some of the newer viruses are able to bypass even this
approach. Shall send you more infomration privately, if you are
interested.

Well, let's say that it is a little bit better than PROTEC.COM... It
can even stop -some- viruses, which are able to bypass the monitoring

Unfortunately, your guess is wrong. Several of the contemporary
viruses (MG, Phoenix, etc.) are able to bypass F-DLOCK even if it was
loaded before them. I guess that this is what caused Frisk to
discontinue this program. Remember, and software protection can be
diabled by software.

The simple reason for this is that drive D: is not infected at all!
The Michelangelo virus infects only the first hard disk and diskettes

It's a memory-resident COM and EXE file infector. At 5 p.m. (in fact,
about 15 seconds before), it plays the Yankee Doodle tune.

Virus Bulletin is an excellent technical journal, when it writes about
viruses. However, the people who are reviewing anti-virus products for
it (especially Dr. Keith Jackson), do not seem very competent (and I
am trying to be polite...). So, the published reviews are not very
reliable. I would suggest that you do your tests yourself, instead of
relying on their data.

Don't look at the VB review. Look at the UT. It's a very nice product,
but I agree that the people from the marketing division have overdone
their claims a bit... :-)

Of course, not. There are at least 17 different ways a virus can use
to infect a file, and I'm pretty sure that the current version of UT
is not able to generically remove at least the half of them... maybe
more.

Yes, you are right. The generic disinfection is a Very Bad Idea
exactly because of that. I admit that the implementation of this bad
idea in the UT is excellent (e.g., it will never corrupt a file when
it tries to recover it, etc.), but the idea is still bad, especially
if the users begin to rely on it. McAfee Associates are trying to
implement it too (with their GenP and GenB virus removal algorithms),
and doubtlessly others will try too, but it's still a bad idea.

I discussed the problem with the people who created the UT. They told
me another argument, which I accept as valid. An integrity checker
detects changes, not viruses, and is therefore prone to false
positives. A typical source of false positives is program updates.
However, if a program is updated (i.e., replaced by a new version), it
will be obviously impossible to recover it generically. Therefore, the
generic removal approach in the UT helps to reduce the false positives
(if it could be recovered, it has been almost certainly a virus, if
not, it might be a clever virus, or an updated program).

The important thing is the users to understand that the generic
removal is not intended to remove any possible virus, but to help make
the decision whether the detected change is caused by a virus or not.
Unfortunately, with the marketing claims that FGS made, it won't be
that easy... :-(

I agree that the quick check provides signifficant level of security,
but I do not agree that the security level is exactly the same as with
the full check. BTW, an idea - maybe the 10/90 rate should be made

I agree that the quick check will catch the virus in the long run, but
I do not agree that a virus writer cannot take advantage of the
knowledge that only the quick check is used on a particular system. He
could make a virus, which collects some statistics which files are
executed most often and infects only them. This way the virus will
spread better, while there will be fewer infected files and therefore
the probability that they will fall in the 10 % fully checked files
will be less.

OK, so you meant that the search speed will not increase noticeably in
the near future. I was sure that you meant something practical, not

I was speaking about ensuring that the system on which you are going
to install the integrity checker is virus-free, not that the integrity
checker itself is not tampered with. And I don't see how you can prove
that the MBR and the boot sectors are virus-free without performing
known-virus scanning... You could use some heuristics, but it is
definitively not sufficient.

Again, I fail to see why. Both IM and UT must be installed on a clean
system. They both must first scan the system, in order to ensure that
it is virus-free. They both must have good virus scanners in order to
achieve this. Once installed, they both don't need their scanners to
be updated in order to detect viruses.

Or, do you mean that IM's virus -removal- does require an update,
while UT's doesn't, because it's generic? Well, if we are counting the
- -successful- virus removal, then in the long run IM is even more
efective, since there -are- infection methods which cannot be removed
automatically, and once the virus writers figure out this, they will
begin to produce mainly such viruses. Viruses, which IM will be able
to remove (if updated), while the generic remover - not.

No, better use the generic removal technique for what it is best
suited (reducing the number of false alerts) and don't let the users
rely on it for actual disinfection...

I said "a Lehigh-type virus", not "the Lehigh virus". I meant a virus,
which hides only in one place in the system...

All checksum-based defenses. In fact, the stealth viruses are just
that. Remember the old argument whether a simple CRC can be forged?
:-) Well, they didn't try to forge it, they just invented a new form
of attack.

I think you'll agree that if a system is infected with a virus, which
infects only one object in the system, and which infects other objects
only if they are modified, will not be detected by a checksummer, if
the checksummer is installed on an already infected system. In fact,
it is possible to design a virus, which will even prenentrate a
checksum-protected system, even if the integrity checkers is installed
before the virus.

The resident module - maybe, but the off-line scanner should detect
them too, IMHO...

Those are only two possible infection methods. When I visited the
authors, I described them 17 different methods I could think about. I
didn't ask which methods will be generically disinfectable by their
method, and I don't know how exactly the method works. I also don't
have the time to perform practical tests. (They will require me to
design the proper infection-simulation tools.) However, I'm damn sure
that no generic removal technique (except a full backup) will be able
to remove a virus, which replaces a signifficant part of the file and
moves the replaced part somewhere else.

As a conclusion - the UT is an excellent product and I recomend it to
everybody. However, let's better educate the users how to do proper
backups, instead of creating in them a false sense of safety (safety,
not security, since I -know- that the UT is secure) by letting them
believe in a magical generic removal method.

You are wrong, the diskette write protection has been always
implemented in hardware on the PCs. The same goes for the Macs.

Most real anti-virus experts are -really- bored to disassemble the

The "improbable life forms" become quite real when they hit your
computer... Recall that not so long time ago Peter Norton has said
that computer viruses don't really exist, and that they are just an
urban legend.

I'm afraid that no strategy is guaranteed to keep out ANY virus, even
if we decide to limit ourselves to the boot sector ones... See below.

Do you have an idea how many different boot sectors exist? One for
each version of the operating system, for each different language
version of it, for each different diskette format, for each different
utility that formats diskettes (SafeFormat, SideKick Plus, PC
Tools,...), for each bootable game...

The Top of Memory does not always help, see below. And, if the system
is already infected by a stealth virus, or even by a normal virus,
they copies might not be exactly what you want... And how are you
going to prove that the system is not infected by an unknown virus?

Just like that, it will overwrite the boot secotor of my diskettes?!
Naw, I'd better keep such programs far away from my computer...

Never say never. Even the best program is useless when it is not
used. If I forget an infected diskette in my A: drive, you won't be
able to detect it before the virus infects my hard disk...

...and also destroy any special diskettes that require me to boot from
them. Like games, copy protected software, etc. Not that I use them,
I'm just speculating. And, if you do not implement the program
perfectly, it may even destroy some of my data diskettes, like a virus
would... Sincerely, have you thought about 800 Kb diskettes?

Yeah, but the virus will get control before VET and could do anything
it wishes. Go stealth, format your disk on April 1st, prevent your
program from executing, etc.

Yep, but we are not speaking about the known viruses. You said that
you are able to detect and remove -any- virus.

Ah, really? And what if the TOM has not changed? Or if the change is
hidden? Or if the virus is only temporary memory resident? Or if it is
multi-partite and the second part keeps re-installing the first one? I
am not speculating, all those are techniques I have seen implemented
in the existing viruses.

> Unless the virus hides itself (and none of the common ones do)

"Common" is subjective and variable. How common was Michelangelo one
year ago? If you widely use a program which stops a particular virus
technique, a lot of new viruses will appear, which will be able to
circumvent your approach and they will spread undetected.

Do you imagine the fuss that it will create in a large company when
they decide to update their DOS version? All their computers will
suddenly become non-bootable - due to your program.

"Extremely unlikely"? "Almost always"? "Minimal loss"? I thought that
you were going to describe a way to remove ANY virus, not just the
common ones. They can be detected/removed even with a simple scanner.

Remember, there is no absolute solution! Trying to tell otherwise your
customers is developping in them a false sense of security. Multiple
layers of protection must be used, with accent to backups and
integrity checking.
