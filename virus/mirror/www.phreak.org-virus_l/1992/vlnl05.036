VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  (The complete set of posting guidelines is available by
FTP on cert.sei.cmu.edu or upon request.)  Please sign submissions
with your real name.  Send contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU
(that's equivalent to VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).
Information on accessing anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue
archives is distributed periodically on the list.  Administrative mail
(comments, suggestions, and so forth) should be sent to me at:

Just to point out that this evaluation used a rather old version of
IBM's scanner; the current version is 2.1.9, and 2.1.2 is about eight
months old.  Something to keep in mind when looking at the scores!

I think Vess may have been a touch hard on the CIAC bulletin, it is certainly
more factual than the CNN newscast and reflects what most of us thought
about the virus just a few weeks ago. I was mistaken about the extent of the
viral damage when triggered but the distinction will make little difference
to anyone who triggers it. If anything can be recovered, it will not be with
Norton's Disk Doctor. (Logical partitions bast the barrier though would be
relatively easy (for a *good* tech).

On an 17 sector/track 5 head drive 11 Mb. (e.g. Connor IDE 40 MB). circa
9 MB on a 20 Mb ST-225, 14 Mb on a ST-251-1, 20 MB on a non-translating
ST-138R, etc ad nauseum. It WILL make all data unretrievable by DOS.
For most people that will mean the same thing.

I suspect that if the UNIX partition is not the first one (e.g. COHERANT)
and does not overwrite the virus, it *might* still work. Of course a
dedicated Unix machine would likely fail to boot. (We NEED a not-for-
profit National Laboratory. The question of who does which and to whom
is getting beyond the bounds of my den closet, even with the network 8*).

Actually there are a number of access control programs that "prevent
floppy booting from the hard disk" including my old DiscSecure (1K) that
take some. Additionally, DOS 4.x uses 1k for a buffer and HP "New Wave"
uses more (651xxx left as I recall).

(386/ix description omitted but wasn't this just in Dr. Dobb's Journal
recently ? Something about a FREEWARE Intel 386 Unix. If this Unix still
worked...)

See above - if the boot partition is DOS 4.x and the floppy is SYSed
5.0, boot from the HD & you will get 654,336. Boot from the floppy &
the result will be 655,360. It would take a *book* to list every known
exception but if 653,312 or less you should know why. (If you have to ask...)

Just be aware that often DATE changes the DOS Date only and Michelangelo
checks the SYSTEM clock not the DOS clock. For instance, on early IBM
ATs, the only way to change the SYSTEM clock was to use a program on the
diagnostic disk.

Cold reboot from a known-clean write-protected floppy and run Fdisk/MBR -
Michelangelo will be removed from the fixed disk. However you then need
to make sure that you disinfect all floppies that have become infected.

In theory, it cannot without help. With reports from England (Inmac Budget
Mouse report in Dr. Solly's latest missive) and A German notchless disk
(VL 5.32 or 33, three in one day now), I am starting to get paranoid.

>even possible?

See my last posting re. Kathy & Vesselin. First, it takes time to write 256
tracks so if the machine is shut down fast (of course the user must be
psychic), Michelangelo may not get all the way. Even if run to completion
the likelyhood of recovery using manual (but conventional) techniques from
three areas of the disk are as follows (for unconventional techniques see
option 2):

Option 1
Area A
Any logical partition that starts after track 255 should be salvagable in
entirety. If I get any free time, I'll write a utility to do just that,
should be simple compared to FixMBR (still free through March 7th &
cheap shareware thereafter).

Area B
Next in likelyhood would be anything past the region of destruction in the
same partition. The data would be there but the FATs would be gone.
Effort would depend on the degree of fragmentation but with enough time &
effort ($), it could all be retrieved.

Area C
Anything in the region of destruction... well, depends on the disk structure
and the level of importance - will be very difficult $$$$) but,
the bigger the disk, the better the chance (sounds paradoxical until you
look at the virus). None from an ST-225, maybe 34% from a non-translating
RLL drive, & as much as 73.015873% of the data in the damage region of
a well-defragged big ESDI disk (educated WAG).

Option 2
Of course with the right equipment (governments and large corporations only
need apply), I believe that the whole disk could be recovered, and easier
than options B & C above (know how and if the NSA or CIA would loan me a
few gadgets...8*). We'll probably find out March 6th (17 days & counting).

Note: these estimates only apply if *NO* attempt is made to restore the
disk with any other tools before delivery to a *good* tech. If you (or
Norton) worked on it first, all bets are off.

Subject: Problems with VSHIELD v86B and WS-WORD 5.0 (PC)

Looks like there maybe a memory problem with VSHIELD v86B (maybe
eariler versions) and Microsoft Word 5.0 (and 5.0A). The whole PC
freezes when some formatting function is required when VSHIELD is
memory resident. This problem goes away when VSHIELD is not loaded.
I've tested this on many platforms, versions of DOS, and memory
configurations - perhaps I'm just lucky ;-) Has anyone else had this
problem?

Subject: Root Directory Virus (PC)

I have been told of what may be a virus and was wondering if anyone had
encountered anything similar.  A friend of mine working in another college
ran into a problem yesterday.  He was in the middle of ms windows when things
started to behave strangly.  The most obvious of these was that his copy
of command.com was missing.  It would appear that all files in the root
directory had disappeared including the system files.  This also happened
independantly to another computer at the same location on the same day
( 18th February ).  We got a copy of scanv86b from garbo but it said that
there were no viruses present ( write protected clean floppy boot etc. ).
Has anyone else found anything similar and does this sound like a virus ?
I'm not a list member so could you send replies direct.

With reference to my earlier posting re a virus that destroyed only
the root directory files.  One of the computers involved has been
found to have tequila whereas the other hasn't.  ( Only the supposedly
uninfected one was scanned earlier ).  We therefore think that the
only file infected may have been command.com.  Then when the program
activated from memory it wiped the only copy of itself on disk as it
was wiping the files in the root directory.  Further infection may
have been prevented because the person involved switched off his
computer as soon as it began to behave oddly.

Is this possible or are we still talking of an unknown virus.
Replies direct please ( not a list member ),

Hi.

I am please to report the availability of FULLVIEW.ZIP.  The program was
mentionned by Patrick Toulme on the FIDO Virus_info conference.  Following is
the excerpt of Patrick's message which prompted me to request the program:

> To answer your question, FULLVIEW will allow you to see,

Note that this program is not a virus detector as such, but can be a fantastic
tool for anyone.  As such, it is *NOT* in the .antivirus directory but in the
.utilities directory.

Best, Claude.

Subject: Book review

Quick review of abook that is a *must-have* for those interested in
finding out more about viruses.

It is called "PC Interrupts: A Programmer's Reference To BIOS, DOS,
And Third-Party Calls", by Ralf Brown & Jim Kyle, Addison-Wesley,
ISBN: 0-201-57797-6, cover price of $32.95.

This is a companion book of Andrew Shulman's Undocumented DOS -- or
should be: same type of cover coloration, etc.  It is, basically,
Ralf's Interrupt List stuck into book form with itsy-bitsy fine print
on each of its umpteen pages.  The index is *wonderful*, unlike that
atrocity of an index found in Schulman's book (not Shulman's fault,
I'm sure).

One portion of the book I do have a problem with: some of the
interrupts that are used by some anti-virus programs are described --
and that's plain irresponsible -- some anti-virus programs can be
simply turned off by making the appropriate calls, presented within
the book in living color (well, black and white).

That same portion of the book, however, does list almost 60 of the
calls made by the viruses themselves for such things as installation
checks and so forth -- very handy for the anti-virus vendors out
there, although certainly not an exhaustive list.
