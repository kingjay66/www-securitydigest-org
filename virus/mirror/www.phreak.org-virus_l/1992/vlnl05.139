Nope, it is not of much use.  I am working on designing a Windows version
of my F-PROT package, but the current VIRSTOP only works within DOS, not
under Windows.

2.04b is a real version, but it was never officially distributed, and should
not be in general circulation.  I sent a copy to a few users that encountered
totally new viruses, that 2.04a could not handle, but I (by mistake) left

Subject: Request For Information (PC)

I have recently joined this group and the Virus Research community in
general and am looking for information regarding viruses, the more
technical the better. More specifically, however, I am looking for
information regarding the hardware level set up of the IBM pc.  For
example:Information regarding what interupts exist, what their
location is, and what triggers them. The fundamentals behind the bios,
the structure of a disk boot record, etc. Basically information
regarding all the things viruses destroy or use to replicate
themselves. I would ask for virus code but having seen what an
irrational outbreak this causes, I will refrain (grin).

Towards this end I have accessed all sites listed in the 'Anti-viral
Documentation archive sites' I got from this list. I have amassed 4
megs of information and have reviewed all of it and have read in
detail 90% of it (I should have the last few articles done by
tomorrow). Unfortunatly there is a definate 'conspiracy of silence' in
these papers as they regularly refuse to go into the sort of detail I
need in order to write an anti-viral product. While the reasoning
behind this may be that this also prevents me from writting a virus, I
assure you that if this is the intention, its a futile one. But, from
what I'v seen so far, this debate is a long winded one and has been
re-treaded far to many times for me to seriously rehash it now.
Suffice it to say that I am looking for more detailed information
regarding encryptions used, modes of transportation, and most
importantly:Specifics on IBM pc architecture. My goal is to determine
the feasability of writting an active protection program which will be
loaded before whatever os the 80x86 machine is running and act as a
'supervisior'. To this end I have nicknamed my idea TRON, based on the
movie of the same name.

The danger of Windows infections lies not in Windows itself but in two
other areas:

1) Windows will execute more files (extensions) than DOS

2) Windows will *hide* some activities from DOS that could include a virus.

Of course the same holds true for a Unix or OS/2 "DOS box" or DesqView
(which I use) or any other shell.

Element 1 is a natural outgrowth of the fact that DOS will execute
*anything* presented to it for execution, the .COM, .EXE, and .BAT
convention is an easily modified function of COMMAND.COM not DOS.

Element 2 is more subtle and deals with the fact that Windows (etc.)
are more closely intertwined with DOS than any anti-viral product that
I know of and can bypass the best current TSRs that I know of through
use of the "undocumented" functions.

For example, in one of my Desqview "windows" that I use for new files,
it is necessary to reload the DOS level antivirus routines again
inside the Window because they were "disconnected" when DesqView
loaded.

In the same manner, the best "tunneling" I have seen is QEMM's
"stealth" mode of memory management - I only found out what was
happening because one of my BIOS programs checks itself and found that
its Int 13 access had been taken away from it !

NetWare loaded after anti-virus routines (since the best AV routines
load from CONFIG.SYS or earlier, this is common) will "take away"
network access making it easy to accidently run an infected file even
though the user *knows* (s)he is runiing an AV product.

IMHO, future AV products *must* cease to be "one-stop" loads and will
require a load sequence starting with the BIOS, another from DOS, and
a "reconnect/ verify" for each critical Window coupled with
self-checking along the way.  There are several interesting
possibilities for this but again IMHO the dynamicism of the malicious
software field makes it evident that what we consider "state of the
art" today will be trivial tomorrow.

Try running SCAN with the /UNATTEND switch, this tells SCAN to skip
over any files that are in use by another program and can not be
shared (accessed) while in use.

I see two possibilities.

   Try running a scanner and scan all files, not just executables - you
   might have an "infected" data file - or a file that has been renamed.

   DOS reads data from the disk in whole sectors, and there is a possibility
   that you have a file that was infected once, it was cleaned, but a virus
   fragment might be in the "dead" area between the file and the end of
   the sector, and the scanners might be finding this in some disk buffer.

Subject: Re: 4096 (frodo) false alarm? (PC)

>(How on earth can random memory or parts from tsr's I load look like
> a 4096 virus???)

Actually not that difficult. All scanners look for strings in memory,
generally in the range of 8-20 bytes long. Though 4096 reduces
available memory when it loads, you are *assuming* that SCAN (or
whichever) only checks that part of memory. T'aint necessarily so
since it is famous for detecting inactive viruses in the disk buffers.

One cross-check is the memory count that scan gives while searching
memory since this indicates the 64k block currently being searched.
For the 4096, if this is not at the TOM, it either is not an active
virus OR it's not the "plain vanilla" 4096. (I suspect that this last
is the reason SCAN does not restrict 4096 memory SCAN to the TOM. Then
again...).

What apparently happened was that Windows *happened* to put a string
in memory matching the 4096 signature (remember the room full of
monkeys with typewriters). The question is: would you rather have an
occasional false alarm or false "safe". Even Vessilin admits that SCAN
is one of the better detectors, its main liability is in identifying
what it has detected, but then that's why everyone has more than one
protection layer, right ?

This is a natural fallout of the competitive nature of the business
that has put a higher premium on speed of scanning than accuracy
(editorial).

Actually, it would be a surprise if the entire CPAV product was
included. More likely would be some sort of trivial checksumming
routine that would tell you *something* virus-like happened, and a
discount coupon for the *real* product.

This could easily be part of a disk-compression device driver (also
rumored) since disk compression routines generally use checksumming to
verify integrity and operate at the file (not sector) level. I have
had some discussions with one of the major aftermarket compression
companies on this subject and on "read-only" container files
(partitions). Still vulnerable to a sophisticated attack but an order
of maganatude better than what is in OSs today.

I would be pleasently surprised to see an effective MBR/DBR routine
included.  Of course that would give a number of disk protection
products fits (Watchdog, PC-Safe, PC-Guardian, my DiskSecure, etc.) if
it were effective as would any sort of BIOS Interrupt validation (but
then CP, like most other AV vendors have been slow to do any
BIOS-level programming (dig)).

However, as I have been saying for the last few years, the above two
techniques would stop the spread of all of today's viruses and that
would not be a bad thing.

There are none but it could be written (code to select one of two
environments would be (relatively) easy, one of three (e.g. PC, MAC,
3090) more difficult, etc. Haven't seen one yet unless you count the
Morris Worm. Like the worm (and unlike virus writers) it would take a
professional. The hard part would be getting it *executed* on the

Mainframe viral programs tend to use source code, mail systems and
interpretters.  Therefore, a terminal is jsut as likely a point of
access as a PC.

Object code uploaded from a PC would not "infect" the mainframe in the
sense of becoming active and reproducing or affecting operations.
However, mainframes are often used as file servers for PCs, and
therefore it would be a good idea to scan all software before upload
so that the mainframe does not become a vector for viral spread
amongst the PCs themselves.

Subject: Floptical Disk Update

You may recall that some months ago I mentioned some products that are
liable to cause a step cahnge in how we think about PCs. One was Disk
Compression and the other was Floptical Disks.

Disk Compression (being software) was accepted first. Floptical Drives
took a bit longer but in this weeks InfoWorld (Aug. 10 pg 78) I see that
the hardware is here and getting close to the predicted price (touch
higher on the drive/lower on the disks).

I know nothing about the company other than I plan to order some disks
for my drive but the virtues of 21MB (42 MB compressed) floppy storage
are evident.

The first thought from an anti-virus standpoint is the ability to have
an entire software recovery suite on a single disk. Those of you
fortunate enough to have Bernoulli drives know how much of an advantage
this can be ( oops, just infected everything with 4096 - no problem, just
recover the whole 40 MB from the image file).

The other advantages should be obvious: mail/fax/bbs system that only
spins when needed. OS/2 on a single floppy (compressed). No more
hour-long swap-the-floppy installations.

Now if they would just come out with a plug replacement module to connect
to a regular floppy controller....

Absolutely correct, I *did* get the names mixed up.  When I went back

HISVIR6.CVP   920810

                        (c) Brain - part 1

The "Brain" virus is probably the earliest MS-DOS virus.  At one
time it was the most widespread of PC viral programs.  (Yet more
support for the "superiority" of boot sector viral programs in terms
of numbers of infections.)  Extensive study has been done on the
Brain family, and those wishing further details should consult Alan
Solomon's analyses (which, unfortunately, are too detailed for full
inclusion in the Anti-Virus Toolkit).  In spite of this, and in
spite of the existence of address and phone number information for
the supposed author, we still have no first, second or even third
hand reports of the production of the virus, and so little can be
said with absolute certainty.  (We do have a first hand report from
the author of the Den Zuk variant, for which I am grateful to
Fridrik Skulason.)

The Brain "family" is prolific, although less so than Jerusalem.
(Seemingly, any "successful" virus spawns a plague of copies as
virus-writer-wannabes use it as a template.)  Again, like the
Jerusalem, it seems that one of the lesser variants might be the
"original".  The "ashar" version appears to be somewhat less
sophisticated than the most common "Brain", and Brain contains text
which makes no sense unless it is "derived" from ashar.  Brain
contains other "timing" information: a "copyright" date of 1986, and
an apparent "version" number of 9.0.

Brain is a boot sector infector, somewhat longer than some of the
more recent BSIs.  Brain occupies three sectors itself, and, as is
usual with BSIs, repositions the normal boot sector in order to
"mimic" the boot process.  As the boot sector is only a single
sector, Brain, in infecting a disk, reserves two additional sectors
on the disk for the remainder of itself, plus a third for the
original boot sector.  This is done by occupying unused space on the
diskette, and then marking those sectors as "bad" so that they will
not be used and overwritten.  The "original" Brain virus is
relatively harmless.  It does not infect hard disks, or disks with
formats other than 360K.  (Other variants are less careful, and can
overlay FAT and data areas.)

Brain is at once sly and brazen about its work.  It is, in fact, the
first "stealth" virus, in that a request to view the boot sector of
an infected disk, on an infected system will result in a display of
the original boot sector.  However, the Brain virus is designed
*not* to hide its light under a bushel in another way: the volume
label of infected diskettes becomes "(c) Brain" (or "(c) ashar" or
"Y.C.1.E.R.P" for different variants).  Hence the name of the virus.
