Subject: Can a virus survive being pkzipped or otherwise compressed? (PC)

A columnist in a local computer magazine (Computer Edge for those in
the San Diego area) mentioned that viruses can't survive or at least
typically don't survive compression into zip files and other archives.

Has anyone had this experience?  And has anyone seen the contrary?

Thanks!

Subject: Hit by Joshi, HD died ? (PC)

	The PS/2 80 in our Lab was hit by the Joshi virus today. I was
scanning and cleanning a infected floppy disk. After that, I turned off the
system and turn on again, the system can only boot from a floppy disk and I
could no longer get access to the hard disk. I think the hard disk was also
infected, but I forget to scan it before I turned off the system.

   	Any help are welcome desperately.

	Thanks!

Subject: Re: Virus from "DIR"? (PC)

It is a commonly stated fact, that it is not possible for a virus to
infect a computer, simply by the user doing a dir on a disc. However,
this is not entirely true - on the Acorn Archimedes, if you catalogue
a disc under the desktop (the RISC-OS GUI) you **CAN** catch a virus.

When the desktop opens a directory on a disc, it checks to see if it
has previously seen the application(s) in that directory, and if it
has not, it runs the !BOOT file associated with the application to set
up the commands and icons used by the application. If this has been
contaminated with a virus, the virus loads itself on to the machine.

Fortunately, most of the (~16) Archimedes viruses are very simple, and
easy to detect. Since the Archimedes OS is held in ROM, there can be
no boot sector viruses, and stealth viruses would have great
difficulties on hiding their changes to files.

I fell that I should share this good news to all readers of
virus-l and novell.

Windows 3.1 comes with new versions of himem.sys, emm386.exe and
smartdrv.exe - These software are defintely a major improvement
over the past versions. Because of them, not only my windows world
but also my dos world is better.

Most notable is the fact that I can now loadhigh virstop.exe
(I could only devicehigh before).

As you probably know, there was a bug (for which a fix exist) in
Windows 3.0 that impaired your outputs when you were loading certain
TSRs (such as virstop.exe). With virstop.exe loaded, I could not
print to my networked postcript printer. This problem is now fixed!

May you upgrade to windows 3.1 or at least get the improved
software!

While not as complete as COPS, Novell has a 'security review' program
for Netware that checks for obvious security holes (too lax on disk
create/write rights, too many supervisors, users without passwords, etc.).
This has been part of Netware for at least 7-8 years now. (It comes in
every box, by the way).

Not quite... The MtE is a library function, supplied in an .OBJ file.
The virus writer has to write a virus which CALLs the mutating engine
by name and link his code with this .OBJ file. When the library
function is called, it gets some parameters - among them the address
of a buffer for workspace and the piece of code that has to be
"mutated". The function then composes a random encryption routine,
uses it to encrypt the piece of code, then generates a random
decryption routine which implments the decryption for the encryption
method used, and prepends this to the encrypted code.

Well, yes, but most scanners are more clever than that... The MtE (in
fact - ANY MtE-based virus) can be detected by a scanner which uses
algorithmic search - it is just very difficult to detect all possible
mutations of the virus and simultaneously not to produce any false
positives... But it is fully possible and, as I mentioned above, once
it is done, the scanner will be able to detect any MtE-based virus.
Since the code of the MtE itself is quite tricky and its source is not
available, it is highly unlikely that the wannabe virus writers who
enjoy producing Jerusalem and Vienna variants will be able to modify
it... The only person who seems able to produce an "improved" version
of the MtE is the Dark Avenger himself...

It's true that this part cannot be encrypted, but it is not true that
it must be invariable. In fact, it varies very heavily - it is very
different with each new infected file.

What you propose works for viruses which only use variable encryption
(like Cascade), but doesn't work for the polymorphic viruses which
vary even their decryption routines...

Subject: Cute virus names sorted (PC)

Hello, everybody!

As somebody noticed earlier in this newsgroup, I am somewhat too busy
sorting the cute virus names. Meanwhile I have achieved some success,
so I decided to publish the results.

They (the results) are available for anonymous ftp from our ftp site:
ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de (IP=134.100.4.42), directory
pub/virus/texts/tests. There you can find the following files:

	- naming.zip. Contains a paper which describes the CARO standard
virus naming scheme and the unique CARO names of every single virus
variant we have in our collection. Since a major confusion exists
about virus naming, especially for the file viruses (which are the
majority), I have provided for comparison the virus names given by Dr.
Solomon's FindVirus, Fridrik Skulason's F-Prot, and John McAfee's
SCAN.

	- reports.raw.zip. Contains the raw reports of the of the
scanners with best detection rate, when run on our full virus
collection. The three scanners are Dr. Solomon's FindVirus 4.12
(drivers of March 28, 1992), Fridrik Skulason's F-Prot 2.03a, and
McAfee Associates' SCAN 89-B. (I have received newer versions of the
scanners just a few days ago, but didn't have the time to re-run the
tests and re-create all the reports.) The archive also contains the
output of F-Prot's heuristic analyser, when run on our virus
collection, so that you can see how well it performs with real viruses
(how bad it perfomrs with non-viruses you can check yourself.) Note
that SCAN shows a signifficantly lower detection rate than the other
two scanners. The reason probably is that I do not exchange actively
virus samples with McAfee's group, so they don't have some of the
viruses that we have and we don't have some of the viruses that they
have.

	- reports.zip. Contains the same listings as above (except the
output of the heuristic analyser), but preprocessed with a couple of
awk scripts and listed in columns side-by-side. This form is much more
readable, but the line width is huge - you are advised to print the
files on a 132-characters per line printer, using condensed mode. A
column which lists the standard CARO name is also added.

	- reports.ps.zip. Contains the same files as reports.zip, but
in PostScript format, so that they are easy to print (but not that
easy to read <grin>) on A4 format pages.

Hope the information will be of any use to you.

Regards,
Vesselin

Subject: PC\MS DOS based Viruses & OS\2 2.0 (PC) (OS/2)

I have a few questions for Ken, Vesselin, and the other GURU's as well as anyone
who is knowledgable enough about PC\MS-DOS, Viruses, & OS\2 2.0.

1. Is it possible for a DOS based Virus to survive & thrive on a system running
   OS\2 2.0 using the (HPFS file system) instead of the (FAT system)?

2. Since IBM claims that OS\2 2.0 can run multiple dos sessions In virtual PC
   windows, if I opened up 5 windows and one of them crashed as a result of
   trying to load a DOS program that was infected by a 1571 Virus would OS\2
   come completely crashing down?

3. What happens to OS\2 if while using the DOS compatibility box in full screen
   a partition table virus like the Jerusalem-b or Michaelangelo infect the
   system and alter the system?

4. If I loaded DOS, Windows3.0, WIndows 3.1, & OS\2 programs in seperate
   windows, and one of my Win3.0 programs get infected by a ping-pong virus
   will the other DOS sessions and the OS\2 session all become infected by
this virus? (I know the ping-pong is more of an annoying virus than a
   destroying virus)

5. How do Fat killers, boot sector viruses, and partition table viruses deal
   with the HPFS system? What if you have more than one type of operating
   system on your hard disk? (ex. DOS, OS2, Unix***, Novell)

    *** This is not the full blown SCO version, it's more like
        COHERENT (a smaller version of unix that has alot of unix features)

The reason for these questions is; I recently received an Evaluation Copy of
OS\2 2.0 from IBM. I got by attending Last month's meeting of the NEW YORK
CONSULTANTS SIG of which I am a member. The Guest Speaker WAS Gary Skiba, A
Technical Advisor For IBM. And Frankly, I was impressed by his know-how on
OS\2 and his ability to not make it a presentation on OS\2. I was also
impressed with his ability to LISTEN and make us ask him real QUESTIONS About
OS\2. WE GAVE HIM MORE THAN A MOUTHFUL!!! SINCE, WE WERE THE KINDS OF PEOPLE
      IBM WOULD HAVE TO CONVINCE. If OS\2 was to get off the Ground.

"Intelligence was not something we expected to be coming from IBM." :)
we're also hoping he was not a fluke, & that other intelligence exists there:)

The reason I asked these questions is because I've been thinking about adding
it(OS\2) to my hard drive when I get by system back intoworking condition.

I am also going to be posting this message onto the OS2 newsgroups, but I
wanted to start here first since the main reason why I would be adding it to my
system is because I supposedly would be able to have an assembler in one window
 a dissassembler in another, a third window for including any pertinent virus
info. into (DOK-V: A virus database project I'm working on), and a fourth
window to safely test the effects of certain types of viruses and trace their
logic.

Any help that can be provided in answering these questions would be greatly
appreciated.

regards,
Chris :)

        If the people doing the procedure have the sense to remove
histocompatibilty antigen DNA from the virus (almost certainly the case),
then there's no problem. There's also the point that if the section of the
viral DNA/RNA coding for the outer protein capsule and for other aspects
of reproduction not neccessary for the implantation are removed, then
viral further reproduction is virtually impossible.

        It can certainly be controlled. Viri won't last forever,
especially if they are chosen properly to have a weak shell. After a bit
to give time to infect, numerous means may be used to clean out the
person's lungs.

        Not really. A computer virus is designed to infect further
"organisms"; a gene therapy virus is not.

I'm not sure if this is what you're referring to, but Fred Cohen's ASP
takes a "snapshot" of memory and registers (between loading of device
drivers and invocation of the command interpreter) on a presumably

Three types?  Five?  How about *thirteen*?  Almost a year ago I start-
ed to make a list of anti-viral techniques, but after I got up to a
dozen, I put the list into a drawer (figuratively speaking) and forgot
about it.  (Admittedly, one of the techniques is hardware, but
Tripathi's original question was not limited to software.)  Anyway,
I've pulled out that list (the only thing I've added since then is the
snapshot technique) and it is appended below.

  I fully expect to see reactions such as "Why isn't my technique X
listed?" or "Technique Y isn't the same sort of animal as the others
and should be omitted" or "Technique Z should be broken up into seve-
ral sub-techniques" or "No, no, you must change the classification
structure entirely!", etc., so please view this list as simply a basis
for discussion and improvement (eventually to find its way into the
FAQ sheet).

                        Anti-viral Techniques
                        ---------------------
 1. Known-virus scanner
(Searches for strings/patterns characteristic of known viruses)
 2. Known-virus remover (file/boot-record disinfector)
(Technique 2 is usually part of the same program as 1; McAfee's
programs are an exception.  The progam(s) may be resident (scanning
only programs which are about to be executed and possibly diskettes
which are about to be accessed) or non-resident (scanning all or
selected files at once).)

 3. Generic (heuristic) scanner
(Looks for suspicious code)

 4. Generic monitoring program ("filter")
(Resident program which checks for suspicious behavior)

 5. Checksumming (integrity checking)
Checks if any file or boot record has been modified.  This may be
implemented in three ways:
(a) by a non-resident program activated by explicit program call, in
order to check all files or a specified list of files all at once,
usually at boot time by virtue of the program name being placed in the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
(b) by a memory-resident program to check each program which is about
to be executed.
(c) by code attached to each program, which is executed just before
the program itself is executed.

 6. Generic disinfection

 7. Hardware write protection (all or part of a disk)

 8. Software write protection

 9. Special MBR to make hard disk appear non-existent when booting
from a diskette

10. Encryption of files, with decryption just before execution

11. Vaccination
(Insertion of identifying string into a file or boot record to fool
virus into thinking that the file is already infected)

12. Bait ("decoy") program

13. Snapshot
(Makes a copy of memory and registers on a presumably clean system,
and then restores them at the same stage on every subsequent boot.)

Subject: How to deal with virus distributors?

I have run a BBS system since 1986.  Until today, the local scene has
always been fairly innocuous (kiddie pirate boards are about the
worst).  Today I found a message indicating a local system was now
distributing viruses (virii?)  and source.  I called up and went
through the new user rigamorol, and with only minimal effort (a
callback verifier and questionaire) had access to a good assortment of
them, including construction toolkits, source in various languages,
droppers, and the like.

The stated purpose is 'education'

What is the best way to deal with this?

number
_ Designated machine for receiving/ testing new disks/software
_ Log of disks/programs received
_ Memory and disk mapping utilities

                             Regularly:
_ Back up data
_ Monitor disk space, map, memory map
_ Monitor program file sizes

                     At software install/change:
_ Protect original
_ Install from protected backup
_ Trial run on isolated system
_ Map memory before and after run
_ Offer "bait" files and disks

                         If infection found:
_ Send copy to recognized researcher

_ Perform minimal disinfection

Once again, note that this checklist does not require any specific
antiviral software.  Antivirals will be dealt with in due course.
