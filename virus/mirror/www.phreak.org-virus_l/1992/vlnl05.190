DAME, as reported by scan, means, "Dark Avenger Mutation Engine."
This is a tool that is used in virus construction, rather than a virus
itself.  Try using a different scanner.

The lock up is a bug in the demo.  The authors knew it, and they put an
option in the command line to run it one demo at a time.  I believe the
format would be "unreal p1" through "unreal p9".  Try this.

This sounds like it might be a bug in "ls", also.  You might want to
run chkdsk and look for some funny allocation errors, and see if there
are soem hidden files that maybe your version of ls is picking up that
a regular "dir" command would not.

  I have a 486 pc 33 mhz MSDOS 5.0 with a 212 meg IDE harddrive.
  The "Your PC is now Stoned" message was followed by complete los of
the drive Not even the Western Digital low level format utility nor
Diskmanager, Fdisk, Spinrite2.20, or Speedstor will access the drive
although all correctly read the Bios specifications for drive type.
The drive is not recognised as being present or as being accessible or
as responding in any fashion.
 I have tried to get fixmbr24.zip via anon ftp from
esel.cosy.sbg.ac.at where my archie server shows it to be available
but I get access denied to the antivirus directory after successful
ftp anon login.
	I don't think the drive is recoverable but anyone with any
ideas please contact me at the edstar address below. I would like to
get fixmbr for future disasters. I have lost about 6 months research
work ( the tape backup fails to restore correctly) so any help would
be gratefully received.

OK - maybe I should not have said "A new level of encryption", but rather that
you just disguised the MtE.  I am sorry, but as I said there is no reasonable
way to handle all possible ways to disguise or encrypt viruses. Even if a
program detects a virus normally, it is always possible to hide it somehow.

>The fact is that F-prot misses all the converted infected files if the

I'm not surprised.  I had not even realized it detected any of the converted
files at all.  F-PROT finds MtE-infected files.  Period.  That's all I
promise.  I make no promises regarding virus droppers - they may or may not
be found - depending what method was used to create them.

However, one very strange thing....according to your information, my
scanner reports the files it finds to be infected with "MtE (?)", but not
"MtE" - now...this usually means that it finds a MtE signature string -
taken from the decrypted virus engine, instead of using an algorithmic
approach.  That implies that the converted files contain a non-encrypted MtE
engine.  This also explains why some programs find it - as they probably just
scanned either the entire file, or a buffer larger than I use.

If the files had been encrypted before they were modified, I am fairly sure
that at least some of the programs that found the MtE would have missed it.

However, my final comment remains that there is nothing particularly
remarkable about this, nor is there anything I intend to do.  I don't intend
to chase all possible ways of writing virus droppers - I just intend to write
(one of) the best program to find and disinfect virus-infected files.

You are of course free to think so - but the fact remains that this is
impossible.  An AV program might be able to find most virus droppers
most of the time, but it will not find all of them all of the time.
This is not simply because it is practically impossible - it is a
theoretical impossibility - the proof of that seems to be just a
simple variation of the proof of the unsolvability of the halting
problem.

When such files appear and are found to be virus-infected, we can
easily add detection of each particular method of virus-dropper
generation method.

HOWEVER.  AS I HAVE SAID BEFORE, AND WILL CONTINUE TO SAY - IT IS
SIMPLY NOT POSSIBLE TO WRITE A PROGRAM THAT WILL DETECT ALL VIRUS
DROPPERS - EVEN IF IT JUST DROPS KNOWN VIRUSES.

Yes - I admit that 2.06a is a bit memory-intensive.  I am working on a
permanent solution to the problem, but that will not be until version
2.07 (after Christmas, I guess).  I will probably release version
2.05b in the meantime, where I have reduced the memory requirements
slightly. I have to make a few other changes/improvements first,
though.

Which is exactly what should be expected - as FDISK /MBR just restores
the MBR, which FORM does not infect at all.  In fact F-PROT reported
the boot sector to be infected, not the MBR.

SYS restores the DOS boot sector, where the virus resides.  To get rid
of FORM, either use SYS (not FDISK) or use F-PROT 2.06.  2.05 could
remove it from diskettes, but would sometimes refuse to disinfect hard
disks - that was fixed in 2.06.

The FORM infects the operating system boot record, not the master boot
record.  FDISK /MBR will be completely ineffective against the FORM.
If it's a DOS partition that's infected, the SYS command should
generally work, but there are lots of versions of SYS out there, and I
have heard (although I have not verified) that some of them will leave
the existing boot record alone if it "looks OK".  Also, if you try to
SYS a hard disk after booting with one version of DOS, but the hard
disk previously had an earlier version of DOS on it, there may not be
room for the system files (it's always best to SYS with the same
version that was there before infection).  Best is probably to use an
anti-virus program that knows how to specifically repair FORM-infected
partitions.

(NOTE: if an OS/2 machine with BootManager installed is booted from a
FORM-infected diskette, the virus will infect the Boot Manager
partition.  The next time you use Boot Manager, it will overlay part
of the virus, and the next time you try to boot from the hard disk,
the system will probably hang.  I don't know how good DOS anti-virus
programs are at detecting and repairing Boot Manager partitions in
these cases; IBM AntiVirus can do it.)

The FORM virus is not like stoned and Michelangelo and the others,
in that it does not infect the main boot record, where the partition
table is.  It infects the DOS boot sector; the boot sector of the
DOS partition.  So FDISK /MBR, which rebuilds your main boot record,
doesn't touch the FORM virus.  SYS.COM, though, rewrites the DOS
boot sector, as I recall, so it would probably remove the FORM virus,
but would not clean viruses like stoned and Michelangelo from a
hard disk.  

It isn't a case of ghosting, no.

Sorry, I can't really help on the other questions you had.

Tim.

The Dexxa (and, I presume, other similar models) ships with a program
called "CLICK.EXE" which is a part of the software used to enable
mouse activity with programs that are not "rodent aware".  The CLICK
program usually searches for a corresponding "menu" each time a

indicate that three programs are being invoked by your command.

I don't think this is the case. According to the documentation in the
German anti-virus program Virendetektor (which can be ftp'ed from
atari.archive.umich.edu) this virus uses an undocumented feature of
TOS to run.  Don't ask me for details - I know nothing of this myself,
I'm just trying to give some useful information. And even if you could
find somebody who knows how it works (like an anti-virus researcher) I
guess that person would not like to tell anybody how.

Those products also happen to be the most popular and most
widely-used.  I think infomration about SCAN, FPROT, CPAV, Nortan AV,
Solomon, and so forth is extremely important when they seem to make up
the vast majority of anti-virus products installed on home and
business PC's.

   New viruses?  Meaning brand-new viruses?  What does this prove?  We
already know that a scanner is no good at detecting a virus if it
doesn't have a signature for it.  And hueristics is still
experimental.  A couple of the hueristical scanning platforms even
flat-out tell you that they are expeimental and shouldn't be relied
upon as a sole means of defense.

I agree...though so far I haven't seen anyone post test results
without also posting the test details as well.  One good example would

   I second that. Virus-L is turning into nothing more than a support
BBS for a few products. It is sad.

   Tell us more about this "evolution system". Do these cretures have the
capability to spread? They must, otherwise they would not be viruses...

   I don't see much use for this analysis yet. The likelihood of average
user getting a virus is increasing; however, I would wager that the virus
that he might get is probably one of the common ones. And the popular
scanners pick them off easily.

   I don't agree that you can simply associate a weight based on the age of
a particular virus. Your assumption about a virus being able to spread far
since it is old is too strong. I think statistics based on actual infection
reports should serve as a basis for assigning weightings of this sort.

   Amen, brother! Posting so-called "reviews" without presenting any
appropriate criteria is useless. The comments simply have no context
in such reviews. They usually end up being a user-interface
evaluation. What a joke! Some of the "reviewers" do not even conduct
"live" tests. They are doing zoo testing even when evaluating
integrity-based products. I think this is only an indication of the
lack of understanding or technical ignorance on the reviewer's part.
No wonder McAfee pays for some reviews. :-)

   Padgett has been crying out loud for an independent testing
facility for a long time. Maybe he has been right all along; we do
need such a service to conduct proper evaluations and tell the whole
story.

Well, you can remove my BBS from the list; "The Programmer's
Paradise", which was in 619 - I took it down when I went to school.
You can replace it with "The Raging Main", at 619-281-0855. (v.32bis)

So what ?  Scanners (by definition) are not guaranteed to detect totally new
viruses.  Even a producer of scanners such as myself admits that. Detection
of totally new viruses is a job for other types of programs - such as your
own integrity software.

I know you realize that the different types of anti-virus software all have
their uses - after all, you asked me once about bundling F-PROT with your
package. However, as I I do not wish to be associated with a virus writing
company, I am not interested in such a deal.

I don't approve of virus writing, virus writing competitions or anything which
indicates that there is a positive side to computer viruses, and my personal
opinion is that you might just have managed to kill your chances of being
accepted as a CARO member.

I don't think your credibility is in shreds at all, Robert.  What a
modest feller!  *8) I just noted one small thing that I thought might
not be right.  The fact that VNET wasn't shut down is just a minor
error in your excellant series; don't lose any sleep over it!

Hm, interesting.  I just dug out my (carefully controlled) sample of
CHRISTMA.  The last line is "ERASE CHRISTMAS EXEC".  So if run from
the A disk, in an environment that doesn't mind extra letters in
filenames, it will erase itself when it's done, I think.  It's
possible that Bridget was dealing with a different version of the
program?  Or that her users were interrupting it before it had a
chance to finish (relatively easy to do in CMS).  But I think you're
basically right on that one...

Ah, but Mr. Slade *is* aware of ASP!  If you will check the
CONTACTS.LST file, you will see it listed at PO Box 81720, Pittsburgh,
which address was obtained from Dr. Fred Cohen.

The reason that the antiviral produced by ASP has never been reviewed,
is simply that, even after email to Dr. Fred Cohen, and letters to ASP
at that address, nothing has been received (other than the above
address).  This makes evaluation a tad difficult.  :-)

However, rest assured that, should it arrive, it would be given
priority treatment.
