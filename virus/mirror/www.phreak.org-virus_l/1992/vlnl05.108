Verifying its presence and activity in memory is an important first step.

How can a user test to see if the software is doing its job?

If they have been hit by a virus before, and saved an infected floppy,
then this could be used to see if the anti-viral software can detect it
on the floppy.  I do not recommend that the typical user keep known
infected floppies around, though.

There was some discussion a while ago about a product (sorry, I can't
recall its name ;-) that made files that "tricked" scanners into
thinking they were infected with various viruses.  This either gave the
user warm feelings if the scanners did find all the bogus files,
or scared their pants off if the scanner correctly ignored the bogus
files.

The question remains open: Is there any way for the typical user to
know that whatever anti-viral product they are using is actually working?

I fear the answer will be: "You gotta trust somebody!"

Just a comment before everyone starts ditching ANSI.SYS & going back to
white on black screens: a one byte change to ANSI.SYS (published it the
last time we got into this) will make it ignore keyboard remapping but
keep the rest of its features (I change the "p" to an unused character
so remapping is still available, just different).

Second, if ANSI is patched, the volume label of a disk "infected" this way
will show up as a set of alphanumerics beginning with a "[" & ending
with a "p". If a normal ANSI driver is used, such malicious software is
still discernable to the wary since the volume label will show up as:
"Volume in drive X is" followed by blanks instead of "Volume in drive X
has no label".

Finally, if the disk door is opened or the disk changed before striking the
fatal key, all that will happen is that a "Not ready reading drive X"  or
"Bad command..." message will occur instead of an infection.

Given all of the above, while ANSI bombs may go into the catagory of
"Stupid PC Tricks", it is hardly likely to be effective for spreading
viruses, something is going to get noticed too quickly.

Now use of an ANSI bomb to trigger malicious software resident in a
printer... Nah: there are easier ways involving weather stations.

Subject: F-PROT says suspicious file (PC)

            Hi there !
    I used FPROT203a to check my hard disk. When I  used the Secure
method, everything was OK. When I tried the Heuristic method, I got
a   report  that   I  had  a  file   that  was  "almost   certainly
virus-infected."  It's a program  from the x_USSR  and I do believe
that it might be infected by an unknown virus.  Anyone interested ?
I'm ready to send the UUENCODE'ed copy of that suspicious file.

Here is the report from F-prot.

Boy, this soul has really been the route. Asside from what appeared to be a
real problem, he recounts nearly every case of anti-virus programs
conflicting known. One item I can help with:

>else..i think....i install vshield it scans memory on boot up and
>everything seems peachy keen except when i press control-alt-delete it
>takes a couple of presses to reboot WHY?  the screen scrunchs up
>before the sluiggish reboot also? why?

This occurs for the reason my NoFBoot does the same thing, VSHIELD is
trapping the ctrl-alt-del reboot sequence and making absolutely sure
that there is not a disk in drive A:. The problem is while a disk in the
drive will usually respond very quickly, there are some cases where it
may not. The technical manual recommends that you check three times but to
be sure may take five accesses in the cycle of:

1) Interrogate drive A.
2) Interrupt allows time for disk to spin up.
3) On failure, reset the disk controller.
4) Try again.

This may take 5 or even 10 seconds on an old system - early 360k floppy
drives are notoriously slow: the clue will be that the drive light is on.

The screen "scrunch" may be because nothing is maintaining the display
(mine just does nothing for a few seconds, when the screen blanks is the
indicator that NoFBoot or Vshield has released the machine to the normal
boot process).

One thing NoFBoot and Vshield do differently is that VSHIELD triggers a cold
(memory check) boot while I consider a warm boot adequate so I load NoFBoot
after loading VSHIELD so my stuff handles the boot request.

Incidently, repeating the "three finger salute" is just going to slow things
down further.

We are using all kinds of machines. PS/halfs, '386s, a few clones...
(This is the MS-DOS department, the Amiga, Atari ST, Mac, and Unix
people have the appropriate machines.) The DOSes are PC, MS, DR,
Toshiba. Versions vary from 2.11 to 6.0. Some disks are Stackered,
others are SuperStored (not all). Most machines (not all) are
networked with Novell NetWare... Your program (out of the box)
couldn't be used on any of the machines (as is), but I could combine
the existing hardware/software in order to have a computer on which it
did.

Please don't forget that my initial comments concerned version 2.0
which was the only available at that time. Version 3.0 might
invalidate all my remarks and be an excellent product, I don't know. I
just reviewed what was available.

Why aborted? The docs say that the scanner part -does- run uninstalled
(and it should be so, of course, or how else are you going to scan
before installation?).

It was a 20 Mhz 386SX HIGHSCREEN notebook with AMI BIOS and a 40 Mb
harddisk.

Oh, I see. There is a similar program (ShrDog) on our ftp site, but it
is not a device driver... Well, how about the idea to put the
information that is saved during the installation in an external data
file (encrypted and with a file name selectable by the user during the
installation process)? Then you mention in the documentation that this
data file must not be moved across the machines and explain exactly
why. Gives much more assurance to the user that s/he knows what's
happening, instead of just scaring him/her...

Nice! The program that is available here which I mentioned above, does
not have this feature... (It also does not work under DR-DOS 6.0.
Unfortunately, this is not my program and I don't have access to the
sources, so I cannot fix it.)

It will also miss a StarShip-like MBR infector (will just say that it
needs re-installation), but this is non-essential, since as you say

Very nice, as I said... Now why not explaining it in the docs? Sounds
much better if I know what the program is doing and under which
conditions exactly it might cause damage, instead of "if moved to
another computer it might cause damage in some cases"...

Read what I said again. I reproche it the claims to "bypass any
stealth virus" and be "the strongest anti-virus product". I could post
here what's wrong in the whole documentation, but it will be a too
long message, if I include the appropriate quotes.

But an example of a PC infected only once in the beginning of the

Yes, that's right, and the test should concentrate on this - depending
only on scanners, using non-up-to-date scanners, etc.

First, I made a silly typing mistake, as I often do. My paragraph that
you quoted should read "It does not have to describe....". Second, I
insist that it is fair to mention in the docs that not all possible
stealth viruses can be stopped by the technique that you are using and
that it is still safer to use the program after ensuring that there's
no virus in the memory (i.e., after booting from a clean floppy).

I know that it is not common. But nevertheless, the fair approach
requires that you tell the user what is the safe way to use the
program and that relying on anything else might be wrong. I do not
reproach your usage of anti-stealth techniques; I'm reproaching your
attempt to make the user rely on them and to make compatibility their
victim.

It is not only theoretically feasable. It is also implemented in his
ASP Integrity Toolkit. True, it can be bypassed by a direct attack,
but he clearly states this in the beginning of the paper that you are
mentioning, right?

Exactly! And how many of us will object to have in MS-DOS the kind of
discretionary access control that Unix provides? True, it won't stop
the viruses entirely, as Cohen has proved, but it would be a much
better to have than the current situation, don't you think so?

The Novell utility named SECURITY is at best a simple tool. It will
not as asked provide the checking of bogus /obvious passwords. This
appears to be a gap that could be filled by a third party Novell
utility or better yet Novell themselves. The utility as a whole needs
to be replaced with a program with greater flexibility and supervisor
options. I have had the same wish in regards to checking for obvious
passwords. I would also like a utility that would do some stats on
intruder lock-outs and user login/logout demographics. A utility that
would be NLM and provide a complete user audit would be necessary.
There is such a system available to bring military operated Novell
systems to the required C2 security posture. IUll check on the
publisher.

Subject: correction to infect. by DIR... (PC)

  I was totally wrong when said that in my last note to this list that
I had a VIRUS that would infect the hard drive after the DIR command.
Was many people pointed out it is impossible. What I got indeed was
the message "virus active in memory..." from the scan program. There
is no way that piece of code in that buffer come to be executed unless
somewhere the processor had a JUMP to that region in memory, which is
impossible by the DOS DIR.

Subject: Anti-viral defenses: Backup (PC)

	Recently we have seen several sources including Vesselin & Rob Slade
commenting that the best means of viral defense is Backup - but who wants to
sit there for an hour with hundreds of floppies ?

	Luckily, the same technology that makes backup a simple mater for
servers is now filtering down to the individual PC level. Readers may
realize that for some month I have been moving Superstor container files
around on Bernoullis and hard disks (much to the horror of the Addstor people)
and have been discovering that it is possible to back up 70+ Mb of programs
in about six minutes using the DOS BACKUP program (more horrors) onto a 45 Mb
Bernoulli (would hold more but that was all I had).

	Admittedly, the old Iomega RCD BACKUP routine is better since it
provides a complete disk image backup (format a disk, don't bother with /s,
RESTORE from a Bernoulli BACKUP, and you have a fully bootable, preconfigured
disk) & is why my drivers are 4.81c (beta) rather than the latest 7.xx or the
new stuff (open something...), they stopped putting in image BACKUP.

	But much as I would like to have a nice 90 Mb transportable at home,
they do tend to be a touch expensive & @ over U$100 for a floppy disk (street
price) are a bit dear.

	Recently, I have seen the One True Answer (for the moment) 20 Mb
Flopticals. It handles 720k 3 1/2s, 1.44 Mb 3 1/2s, & 20 Mb (the mfg. calls
them 21 Mb, Dos format says 19.85 Mb, CHKDSK says 20.3 Mb so take your choice).
Whatever they are, at under $20/disk, full backups become very, very easy
and cost effective.

	I can see quite a few other advantages to the things also - with
a floppy disk shortage looming (thanks to windows) consider the advantage
of being able to put a complete 25 disk OS/2 installation on one disk (with
just a bit of compression). Every Windows app I know of could fit on one
disk without compression. No more shuffling, just a straight XCOPY would work.

	Right now am considering one of those new sub-U$300.00 V-32bis modem/
FAX/Voice Mail/ANI cards in an old XT chassis, a floptical, and a batch of I/O
ports as an integrated office machine & print server. Given a cheap 20 Mb
floppy, lots of things become possible & why tie up a 386/486 for this sort of
distributed task ?

	Of course, all is not sweetness and light. The major problem I have
with the flopticals is that the Floptical Standards Committee (Insite,
Iomega, Adaptec, etc.) has adopted a SCSI interface standard & not just
a standard SCSI interface, but a special one that recognizes the floptical
drive as a removable drive. If not, the drive firmware is designed to treat
the disk as read-only. (May be software "correctable" but am not sure).

	This means that you cannot just plug one into a U$39.00 Seagate
SCSI controller & expect full functionality.

	Now my real problem with the drive is that it requires a SCSI
interface rather than just plugging into a "normal" floppy controller
which would have eliminated the "removable" question in the first place.

	I agree that the performance is probably better with  the SCSI
interface but think that many people would prefer something that could
just be plugged into their existing PC for minimum cost.

	For those with notebooks (that IMHO would be the immediate market)
this special SCSI requirement eliminates the floptical from consideration,
even for those rare machines (NEC Ultralite, Apple Powerbook) that have
built in SCSI ports. For those with "real" PCs there are other drawbacks:

1) The SCSI controller takes up a slot
2) The SCSI ROM uses up some high memory
3) Pre-existing SCSI cards are incompatable

	Now again IMHO, the floptical is one of the greatest quanta to
appear recently and is the "right" size (have already put 40 Mb on one with
compression). So a minor technical problem (a chip to make the SCSI firmware
compatable with a "normal" disk controller) shouldn't slow it down for long.

	In any event, given "plug & play" compatability, this IMHO makes
lots more sense than the expensive 2.88 Mb floppy (incidently, the floptical
drive is  said not to work with these - I still haven't even seen a 2.88 so
cannot say) and can provide a very good media for backups as well as making
special configurations a breeze. Certainly, they will be a tremendous asset
for anti-viral researchers.

	I received quite a bit of static about my views on disk compression
last year. Well, here we go again.

Absolutely not.

It is impossible.  When you execute a DIR command, here is the basic
sequence of what happens.
  1) DOS sees your command, and executes an INT 21h for findfirst() of the
filespec you specified.  It also does a findnext, if necessary.
  2) These findfirst/next calls do a bit of translation, and eventually get
to reading in the directory sectors to see what all is there, file sizes and
dates, which it returned as DATA, and used AS DATA.
  3) Then another int 21h {function is called to see how much disk space is
remaining.

In all cases, the information which is retrieves is used as data, and not as
executable code.  Since there is no executable code, and moreso, since there
is no way to read in a boot sector of a disk through a "dir" and execute the
code there, an MBR infector could never possibly load into memory.
Nonetheless, it is impossible, except for as Vess pointed out, you are
unfortunate enough to get ANSI-bombed, but you wuold still see what is going
on for the most part unless it was explicitly designed.

If you think it infected your hard drive, it might not have.  Esp. if you
used McAfee's scan to look.  if you had a dropper or similar program on the
disk, it is possible that some overhead from the dir command or perhaps even
from scan (nah...) would be in memory, though not actually active.  Scan
will find it in memory, and tell you that you are infected with a virus
though it's not actually so.

It is not a bug in scan, just a mess from other programs.

QEMM can get very "clever" in loading stuff HIGH, particularly if the

in the memory check.

Scanners can only detect viruses already known to the scanner's author, or
variants containing the instructions in the search string, perhaps you
need to get a newer version.

CPAV is notorious for causing problems with other scanners.  CPAVs search
strings used are not encoded at all, so if they match the strings used in
other scanners they may be reported as being the virus(es).

The pipe (|) was imported to MS-DOS from UNIX.  On UNIX systems dir & more
would execute at the same time, with the operating system using the output
of dir to feed the input of more.  MS-DOS can only run 1 program at a time,
(surprise) so it simulates the UNIX feature in several steps:
1   running dir with the output directed to a randomly named file,
    (dir >random1)
2   running more with the input directed from the file, (more <random1)
3   deleting the random file, (del random1)

The temporary files are usually created in the root ("\") directory
of your current drive, although this may depend on the DOS version.

I don't know what the second file does, DOS didn't put anything in
there during my tests just now.  But it does appear to be a normal
feature.

You have missed something very important: SCAN does not find Stoned on
the hard disk, it finds it in memory.  (You didn't need to run CLEAN or
MDISK to remove it, did you?)
There is a -very- good reason why it is in memory, DOS has just read
the boot sector of the new disk in to one of its disk buffers.  It does
this in order to read a table of data (called the BIOS parameter block
or BPB) which tells DOS what format the disk is.

When Stoned infects a PC it becomes resident at the top of your 640 or
512k of main memory.  Scan should only look in that area of memory for
boot viruses, however it looks through other places as well including
DOS's buffers.

There are many versions of Stoned, where only the text message has
been hacked.  Others have small or large changes to the function
(eg Michaelangelo).

Most scanners don't identify the particular version of the virus that
was found, (one of my hobby horses).  I don't remember having any versions
of Stoned with rude messages.

In MS-DOS 5 Microsoft copied what Digital Research had been doing for
a while, the boot sector program searches the root directory for the
system files.  Old versions required the hidden system files IO.SYS &
MSDOS.SYS (IBMBIO.COM & IBMDOS.COM) to be the first two entries.  Most
users still need to SYS or FORMAT /S to put the hidden system files on
to the diskette, although tools such as Norton Commander or XTREE could
be used.

Delete & replace should be just fine.

Tequila works in 2 stages:
*   When an infected file is run it checks the hard disk MBR, and if it
    is not already infected it performs the infection.  It performs no
    other action at this time, it does not become memory resident.
*   Booting from an infected hard disk places the virus in memory, where
    it makes itself comfortable.  It waits for MS-DOS to load and attempts
    to infect programs when they are executed.

Note that Tequila does not infect floppy disk boot sectors, although some
have been hand patched.  Supposedly to test the ability of virus scanners
to detect the virus, without the inconvenience of an infected hard disk.
Needless to say, any scanners that only look in the places that the virus
can put itself will fail this test.

If a virus is in a file when the file is ZIP'd then it will be there
when you unzip it again.  The purpose of such archiving software is
to maintain the integrity of the original files, usually in a reduced
volume.

What changes is the visibility of the virus, whilst inside the archive
a virus would be invisible to virus scanning s/w.  Scanners operate by
examining programs for known sequences of operations, using a template
of the bytes sought - these templates don't exist in compressed archives.
To scan archives you must either extract the content so that the scanner
can examine the original files, or use a scanner that incorporates an
archive extractor to do this automatically.

Note that the converse is also true, because many virus scanners examine
the compressed data, rather than recreating the original, they often give
false alarms.  This is most likely for large compressed files where the
file has a nearly uniform distribution of all byte values in nearly random
sequences.  (Especially those files holding the compressed disk volumes
for programs such as Stacker).

Subject: OS/2 2.0 questions. (OS/2)

OS/2 2.0's vulnerabilities and strengths v.s. DOS viruses haven't been
adequately explored.  I have done some limited testing of DOS viruses
under OS/2 2.0, but not nearly enough.  Here are some scattered notes.

- - OS/2 DOS sessions can access files in an HPFS filesystem (partition if
you will) as long as they conform to the old 8.3 filename.extension
format.  Files that don't conform to this format (e.g. files with long
names) are invisible in DOS sessions.  As far as DOS sessions are
concerned, HPFS is just a somewhat faster filesystem with faster access
to files in very large directories, less wasted space (allocation unit
is 512 bytes) and better built-in caching.  File infecting DOS viruses
can infect from DOS sessions as long as they use normal DOS filesystem
interfaces to infect.

- - Pure OS/2 programs will be damaged if infected by many (most?)  common
file infecting viruses.  "Family API" programs, that are "bound" to run
under both OS/2 and DOS, will also be damaged by many file-infecting
viruses.  OS/2 programs are probably about a susceptable in this regard
as Windows 3.X programs.  As I recall, these programs have short stub
EXE headers that make the program do something under DOS and another EXE
header that defines what happens in OS/2 mode.  Somebody else may be
able to provide more detail?

- - OS/2 2.0 can run multiple DOS sessions in multiple windows.  Each DOS
session has its own memory address space.  The filesystem is the only
thing shared between DOS sessions (that I know about; there may be
sharing API's, but DOS viruses probably won't know about them.)  When a
DOS session is closed, it goes away completely unless it left something
behind in the filesystem.  Viruses that hang a session will generally
just kill that session, in my experience.  DOS viruses that infect
COMMAND.COM, such as the 4096 (AKA Frodo, 100 years), can be a problem,
since every DOS session uses COMMAND.COM.  i.e. after the 4096 infects
COMMAND.COM, every DOS session started subsequently will become
infected.

- - Full screen DOS sessions aren't particularly different, except that
they can be considerably faster if a lot of screen I/O is happening.
(The Jerusalem-b is a file-infecting virus.)  Master-boot-record
infectors like the Michelangelo that infect when an infected diskette is
booted can be a problem.  In general, direct writes to the hard disk
using INT 13 are prohibited, so bimodal (multi-partite) viruses such as
the Flip-2153 (or Flip 2343) will not be able to infect the master boot
record.  (I haven't tested Flip, to be honest.)

- - Windows 3.X programs can't be infected by the Bouncing Ball (aka
Ping-Pong), which is an partition-boot-sector/diskette-boot-sector
infector that infects a system when an infected diskette is booted.

- - Direct writes to the hard disk using a sector level interface (INT 13)
are prohibited in DOS sessions.  I don't know whether all disk
partitions are protected, but certainly the C:  partition is protected.

- - Boot sector viruses can be a serious problem, though they will not be
spread by OS/2 2.0. For example, the Michelangelo infects a hard disk
when an infected diskette is booted.  When the system boots, the
Michelangelo gets control before the operating system.  On March 6 (of
any year) this would be bad.

- - However, boot sector viruses are more worrisome for other reasons.
OS/2 has two methods of supporting multiple operating systems.

One is called Dual Boot, and lets you put DOS and OS/2 on a single
system.  In OS/2 sessions, you say BOOT /DOS, and the system obligingly
saves the boot record in a file, overwrites the boot sector (with some
undocumented OS/2-mode interface) and replaces the CONFIG.SYS and
AUTOEXEC.BAT with DOS versions.  In DOS sessions the reverse happens.
If your DOS session happens to be infected with a DOS virus, and you
"boot /os2" the system will obligingly save the infected boot sector in
a file.  When you do the reverse, it will restore the infected boot
sector.  The only partition boot sector virus that I've seen in OS/2
systems is the Form.

The other is call the Boot Manager.  (Originally called MOST, but I
guess syllabic proliferation prevailed.)  (Following details worked out
by examination; I haven't found any documentation).  The hard disk
partition table is a normal partition table.  There is a new partition
type (type 0x0A in the partition type field in the partition table
entry).  This partition is marked the active partition.  The boot
manager partition is a megabyte partition invisible to DOS and OS/2
except through direct disk I/O.  The Boot Manager partition is basically
an operating system selector.  When the system boots, you get a display
of operating system choices, i.e. it asks which partition you want to
boot.  You can boot partitions in extended partitions if you like.  (An
enhanced FDISK allows you to specify what partitions should be in the
menu, what the default partition is, etc.) With Boot Manager, a system
with a large hard disk can hold multiple operating systems.  The Form
virus is a problem with systems that use Boot Manager.  What happens is
that the Form virus infects the Boot Manager partition.  Most virus
detectors don't detect it there.  When an operating system that doesn't
use BIOS (such as OS/2) is selected via the Boot Manager, the Form virus
doesn't survive the boot process, the system will not spread the Form.
When DOS is selected via the Boot Manager, the Form virus *does* survive
the boot process, and the system will spread the virus to diskettes.
This can be very mysterious to people that don't know what is happening.

- - Another interesting feature is that OS/2 2.0 will allow you to "boot"
a window from a DOS partition, a DOS diskette, or an image of a DOS
diskette.  If you *really* need a particular DOS environment, you can
get it by making an image of a bootable diskette with your environment,
and booting it.  This facilitates testing of DOS software under multiple
operating systems.  In limited testing, we were unable to get boot
sector viruses to spread to the hard disk by booting images of an
infected diskettes.

I'm a post-doc working on taxonomy of this kind for biological
organisms.  The scheme Norman describes is similar to ones in use
for analyzing DNA data.  However, I'm dubious that it would be useful
for computer viruses.  The assumption in biological taxonomy is that
changes in a DNA sequence generally occur one at a time and at random.
Changes in computer viruses, on the other hand, occur in batches and
generally for a purpose--and the purpose is often concealment of the
virus' taxonomy from a scanner.  Because of this, I suspect that
numerical taxonomy will give disappointing results in classifying
viruses.  It will tend to consider viruses as very different which are
simply rearranged or recoded versions of the same exact functional
structure.  It seems particularly iffy for polymorphic viruses, unless
attention can be focused on a non-polymorphic region.  (The same
problem is encountered in classifying influenza variants, which use a
scheme eerily similar to polymorphic computer viruses.)

You might do better by hand-scoring each virus for the use of certain
characteristic manuvers, preferred locations, type of file infected,
etc. and then using that scoring as input to a taxonomy program.  This
approach is also used in biology, especially for fossil data.  It's
more subjective, and somewhat sensitive to the choice of characteristics
to score, but it's more likely to create a taxonomy that reflects the
intuitive relationships between viruses.

If information about specific taxonomy algorithms and programs would be
helpful, you can write to me.  I think it's an intriguing problem, and
it will be fun if some of our algorithms have computer science
applications!

Subject: BAD IDEA (was: Where can I find Virus signatures?)

In VIRUS-L Digest V5 #106 Christopher Mateja asks:

>  1. Are there any lists availible containing all known virus signatures?
>      1a. where can I find them?
>
>  and 2. How can I get them?

   Putting it as simply as I can, if you don't HAVE virus signatures
as the result of taking an active role in anti-viral activities, you
don't NEED them.  And those persons/organizations who do, don't want
their information posted in someone else's database.

   [Ken, can you synthesize a FAQ out of the above?]

IFIP/Sec'93,  the Ninth International Computer Security Symposium
and Exhibition,  is part of a series of international conferences
devoted to advances in data, computer and communications security
management, planning  and  control.   It  will be held May 12-14,
1993 in Toronto Canada.

This  international  conference,  with  the  theme   "Discovering
Tomorrow",  will  encompass  developments  in  both  theory   and
practice  and  is  intended  for  computer  security researchers,
managers, advisors, EDP auditors from government and industry, as
well as other information technology professionals  interested in
computer security.

The purpose of the 1993 International Federation for  Information
Processing  Security  Conference  [IFIP/Sec'93]  is to provide  a
forum  for  the  interchange  of  ideas,  research  results,  and
development activities and applications amongst academicians  and
practitioners  in the information, computer and systems sciences.
IFIP/Sec'93 will  consists  of advanced seminars, tutorials, open
forums, distinguished keynote  speakers  and  the presentation of
