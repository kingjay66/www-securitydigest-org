Subject: Comment on the MtE wars (PC)

Obviously none of you are willing to publicly discuss the exact hows
and whys of anyone's MtE-detection algorithm, for the usual reasons.
So the entire discussion is so far based on percentage hit rate, which
for me has significantly less meaning in terms of explaining WHY
product A sucks and product B is so much better.  Is this just me, or
does it smell like so much handwaving to anyone else, too?
Unfortunately I feel like I still have to slog through it all to find
the occasional hard useful facts.

This is OK for someone who *only* has MD-DOS on the disk but does
nothing to give a "warm & fuzzy feeling" to those who also have OS/2,
Unix, or Novell partitions (just cleaned up a Novell server that had
been infected with Michelangelo. After disinfection the entire 1+ Gig
Novell volume was unreachable. With the aid of my trusty TI-Programmer
and DEBUG was able to rebuild the tables - and they said it couldn't
be done 8*).

The "UNFORMAT/PARTN/L/TEST" command will show *all* of the partitions
including the Non-DOS ones as will my FixMBR. If saved or printed, the
info can be used to restore a disk even if the entire MBR is lost (not
trivial but *can* be done). FixMBR just permits saving the whole
sector as a restorable .COM.

Yes, there is no need (almost) to check the rest. Besides in
conventional memory (up to the 640 Kb limit), a virus could also
reside in the following places:

1) The video RAM.

2) The high memory (or in the upper memory blocks).

3) The exTended RAM.

4) The exPanded RAM.

Till now, there are no known viruses that use the last two methods.
Since the known-virus scanner can detect only known viruses, it is
obviously useless to check places in memory where no known virus can
reside.

Furthermore, the extended and expanded RAM cannot be addressed
directly, like the conventional RAM. Therefore, even if somebody
writes a virus that hides there, the virus will still have to uses a
small part that resides in the conventional RAM and swaps back and
forth the rest of the virus that resides in the "unconventional" RAM.
Thus, even in this case it will be possible to detect the virus,
without scanning the unconventional memory.

Additionally, there are no viruses yet, that load themselves in the
high memory. Such viruses are perfectly possible, but, as I noted
above, it is useless for a scanner to scan for something that does not
exist yet. However, there -is- a need to scan the high memory for the
- -existing- viruses.

The reason is, that the virus could infect one of the user's TSR
utilities, that are loaded high from AUTOEXEC.BAT (or even from
CONFIG.SYS). If this is a resident virus, if it is small enough, and
if there is enough free high memory, chances are that the virus will
be loaded into the high memory without problems and will work from
there. Therefore, this part of the computer's memory -must- be checked
for infection.

But this is not just "1 Mb", as you mentioned. It is slightly more. On
a '286 it is 1 Mb + 64 Kb - 16 bytes. On a '386 and above it is more -
it can be up to 1384 Kb, I think. (Note: I am not certain about the
exact figures. I somebody who reads this knows better, please post the
correct information.)

You are right, of course. But my initial message ("SCAN 95b does not
detect the MtE-based viruses in EXE files") was caused by the fact
that -during- the tests (i.e., when the final results were not
available yet), we observed a -bug- in SCAN's MtE detection algorithm.
Having in mind how popular this product is (according to McAfee
Associates, they have more than 7 million installations), and how many
people depend on it, I was precipitated to inform everybody about what
I considered to be a serious bug.

That it was a bug is without doubt - while SCAN still misses some
infections in COM files, it detects -most- of them, therefore there
was no reason (due to faulty recognition) to miss ALL infections in
EXE files. It seemed as if it didn't check the EXE files for MtE
infections at all. Having in mind that one of the viruses used during
the test (Groove) infects both EXE and COM files, that we received
this virus from the USA, and how popular McAfee Associates is in the
anti-virus field, I found hard to believe that they didn't have a copy
of the virus... Anyway, I'm probably wrong...

My point is: I posted not incomplete test results; I posted a warning
about a bug. I consider it my duty to do so, and will continue to do
so in the future - I'll report any serious bugs that I discover in the
popular anti-virus products, in order to warn their users.

You will have the full independent review. The tests are ready; I'll
write the report tomorrow. And I am not "slamming specifically
VirusScan". Just the opposite - I find it good enough to be
criticized, so I am criticizing its drawbacks - because I believe that
this is the way to get the drawbacks corrected.

There are LOTS of anti-virus products on the market, which are not
even worth criticizing! In my MtE detection tests I made BIG efforts
to test all the scanners that we have, that claimed to detect the
MtE-based viruses. Some of these programs have so many bugs, that I
would never bother to use any of them in the real life! One of them
crashes the system, if your total (not just the free!) environment
size is above 256 bytes. Another one can scan only whole drives, not
directories, and the virus test set was on a network server, with
other directories present... Yet another of the programs forced me to
type in the name of the report file entirely 8 times (not just
correcting it). Another one stops scanning after a few hundred
infections are found, because it tries to keep the whole report file
in memory! Yet another one does not create any report file at all,
regardless that it is instructed to do so! Most of the report files do
not contain any information -which- files are missed (and I guess,
after I publish our results, all the producers of these programs will
contact me, asking for the missed samples). One of the scanners just
aborts with the message "No memory!", regardless that I have 505 Kb
conventional RAM and megabytes of free XMS and EMS...

As far as I recall, Flip is a stealth virus, or at least it is stealth
enough to "hide" the increase in the file size. When a virus like this
is active in memory and the user runs CHKDSK, the latter sees the
discrepancy between the file size (as clusters allocated for the file
in the FAT) and the reported file size (as reported by the DOS
functions that are subverted by the virus), and reports file
allocation errors. If it is run with the /F option, CHKDSK tries to
"repair" the allocation errors, actually screwing up everything.

An inexperienced observer may report this as the paragraph that you
quoted. BTW, some viruses (Diamond, SVC) are smart enough and do not
cause such problems.

VCL is a Borland IDE based "Virus Creation Laboratory" that creates
poorly optimized, inefficient overwriting .COM and .EXE infectors.
You can get ahold of it on most virus bbs's or from a virus writer or
an anti-virus buff who would trust you with it. If you understand
Assembly it is possible to patch the code and create virii and some of
the code is sound enough to create a virus with.  Compared to the
current technology available in the virus world it is outdated.
Unfortunately, the author has promised to release a second version
which is supposed to have several improvements that will make it more
fun for researchers to play with. I doubt it will create any serious
problems though. The release will probably be in January or Feruary of
1993.

MtE is the Mutation Encryption Engine developed by Dark Avenger. It
changes filesizes, checksum, and other info that would make it
possible to detect a virus in a file at runtime so that the virus can
continue to hide on your computer. The latest version is .91b, unless
DA has released a newer one.  You can get it from your favorite AV
researcher that trusts you or off a virus bbs. I won't give you any
such info (bbs's or copies of the software.) If you don't know
assembly, it wouldn't help you much anyway.

VCL stands for Virus Creation Laboratory. This is a program with a
glamorous flashy user interface (pop-up windows, pull-down menus,
context-sensitive help, and all that jazz) that generates viruses. The
viruses generated by it are buggy, usually do not assemble, when they
assemble, they usually hang the machine, and when they don't - they
refuse to replicate. So, VCL and the virus generated by it are not
dangerous per se. What -is- dangerous, however, is the raising trend
to produce virus creation packages, that allow even the person who
knows literally -nothing- about viruses or even about assembly
language, to create new viruses.

I don't necessarily have any revelations to add, as I've never had my
working machine heavily infected (I don't think information on my test
machine would be relevant :-). However, I can add the following (label
me as an "average user" for this):

I have a 200 MB hard disk, which is about 90% full (178 MB). This is
probably pretty average for many users.

On the disk, I have 866 executables (according to Virscan).

Of those 866 files, I would expect the 80-20 rule would apply: I
probably spend 80% of my time in 20% of my programs (even including
the fact that I run Windows on this machine). I would hesitate to say
that I even spend 20% of my time on the other 80% (there are some
files I haven't used in a year, I'm sure).

All this would imply that about 175 executable files are used
regularly, and would be running a risk of being infected (unless the
virus ran amuck for a long period of time).

I would suspect that seeing somewhere between 75 and 150 infected
files (depending on the virus) would seem a reasonable guess.

Just my two cents worth.

Are you sure of this?  The reason I ask is that does not always use
the "top-and-tail" (or "beginning-and-end," etc.) method of searching
for file-infecting viruses, especially if a "fragmentation attack" is
performed.

Subject: Re: SCAN 95b doesn't find MtE in EXE files (PC)

I am a satisfied owner and user of McAfee software, to the tune of
several thousands of dollars.  And I have no major gripes about the
products.  There are a number of nit-picking things I'd like to see
changed, but that's not why I'm writing.

I've noticed, over the course of more than a year, that there have
been a great many shots fired between the various representatives of
anti-virus software authors/vendors and "experts".  While it is
important, even crucial, that there is a good amount of competition
for technical excellence, I am dismayed by the type of bickering, and
even flaming, that goes on in this newsgroup.  It does seem to me that
certain authors take extra effort to knock McAfee software, but I have
seen McAfee dish it out just as well.  Hopefully this will come to an
end in the near future, as it diminishes the effectiveness of this
forum and blemishes the reputations of all involved parties.

At the present, I agree with some of Vesselin's comments, though I
have some questions as to his motivation for prereleasing, and more
importantly, singling-out McAfee's software results separately from
all others he's tested.  It appears to me, the casual reader of this
newgroup, that Vesselin is grinding an ax with McAfee here, though I
don't know why this should be.

If there is a shortcoming to McAfee's or anyone elses' software, I
much prefer to read about it here than discover the flaw after a
couple hundred workstations are affected.  The fact that public
disclosure in this newsgroup inevitably leads to a hieghtened level of
attention from the developer is also, in my view, a benefit.  Further,
I cannot fault Vesselin for reporting on the results of what was the
currently available versions of software at the time he started the
evaluation (and, of course, that the evaluation hasn't been going for
too long without checking for an update).  After all, such processes
require a clear beginning and end, and to restart the entire process
each time any one of the involved products were revised would lead to
a never-ending cycle of evaluations without results.

However, since new viruses and new revisions to the anti-viruses
continue to arrive, it is important to realize that any evaluation of
the products is likely to change without notice, and as much should be
included as a disclaimer on any results that are published.  There-
fore, the evaluation process must be continuously repeated, with
results presented on a regular, scheduled basis, and a warning that
the results may and often do change frequently.  I believe this would
be fairest to all, especially to the users of these products, who
could then track which author/vendor is quickest to respond to new
viruses and provides the most consistently good protection.

Finally, as to the issue concerning alleged misleading advertisement,
I feel that the implied denial of responsibility by McAfee is irres-
ponsible.  Regardless of whether McAfee polices its agents or not,
their agent's claims and actions reflect upon McAfee.  I would have
rather seen McAfee say it would investigate the matter and take action
to prevent reoccurence, instead of making it sound that it has no
control over or desire to correct the mistatements of its selected and
authorized agents.

These are my opinions, provided here in the hopes of a movement
towards more reasonable and productive discourse.  My goal is not so
much to admonish, though I've done some of that.  Instead, I'm hoping
that the signal-to-noise level here can be improved through less
bickering and market positioning.  If all that fails, at least you
have some idea how these outbursts seem to one who looks to this group
for facts, but too often finds gossip, so much as to give comp.virus
only the most cursory glances as I try to keep up with the wealth of
useful information on UseNet.

Hmmm... does this imply that once we all have OS/2 or whatever on 386s
or better, and 32-bit applications addressing oceans of flat memory
space then we will have to wait forever for SCAN or some other to scan
the whole bloody lot when we boot up each morning?

There are more versions known. The versions that you have mentioned
correspond to the standard CARO names Cascade.1701.A, Cascade.1704.A,
and Cascade.1704.Format. The full list of all Cascade variants we know
about is:

Cascade.1621
Cascade.1661
Cascade.1701.A
Cascade.1701.B
Cascade.1701.C
Cascade.1701.D
Cascade.1701.F
Cascade.1701.S
Cascade.1701.Yap
Cascade.1704.A
Cascade.1704.B
Cascade.1704.C
Cascade.1704.D
Cascade.1704.E
Cascade.1704.Format
Cascade.1704.Multi
Cascade.1704.Y
Cascade.1706
Cascade.Formiche
Cascade.Jojo.1701.A
Cascade.Jojo.1701.B
Cascade.Jojo.1703

This makes 22 known variants. In fact, the only two that are spread in
the wild are Cascade.1701.A and Cascade.1704.A.

Is this -really- necessary? As far as I understand, the command FDISK
/MBR (not that no hard disk is specified as an argument) uses INT 13h
to rewrite the MBR of the first hard disk. In order to do that, it is
not necessary that the logical drive is visible to DOS. Therefore, you
can use FDISK/MBR, regardless of the DOS version the hard disk is
formatted with - you will need only a DOS 5.0 system diskette...

Or do you mean that in order to verify whether the disk is accessible
(i.e., to ensure that FDISK /MBR will be effective), you'll need to
boot from the same or higher DOS version? Well, even in this case it
does not matter, since you need to boot from DOS 5.0, in order to have
the /MBR option of FDISK, and 5.0 -is- currently the highest version
of DOS available...

At the time the tests were performed, version 95b -was- the latest
version of SCAN that was released officially (i.e., on the ftp sites).
It's not my fault that you have released a new version during the time
period between the posting of my message and its appearance on
comp.virus.

Furthermore, as I have stated several times, my message reported a BUG
in SCAN. Therefore, even if I were aware of the existence of the new
version, I would still post the warning and suggest the users urgently
to upgrade to it and not to use the old version. So, in any case, my
message -was- necessary.

Meanwhile, Fridrik's point still holds - the current version (most
latest, etc.) of SCAN (97) was NOT able to detect all replicants used
in the tests, while other (out-of-date) variants of other scanner
- -were- able to do so.

To be held? Till when? I've tested 17 scanners - maybe I should have
waited until all the 17 producers have fixed all the bugs in their
products? And until meanwhile some of them release new versions? With
new bugs? This could take forever...

I would tolerate it if it did happen only once, but three times! Why
it's always the agents of McAfee Associates that are doing unethical
advertising? Are you really so bad in selecting your agents?

I would apply Occam's razor here... The simplest reason seems to be
that SCAN is indeed buggy and that your agents are indeed doing
unethical things...

A more virus-related implication is of course that the virus authors
cannot sue people like myself who tear viruses apart to find out how
they operate and how to get rid of them.  

Actually, a few virus authors have actually specifically forbidden any
disassembly or reverse engineering of their code.  We have of course not
taken them seriously, but it still nice to know that we probably have
the law on our side :-)

In a previous post, I announced that the 97 series of McAfee software
was available on my mail-server.  The files were listed as follows:

/public/dos/virus/scan97.zip
/public/dos/virus/clean97.zip

I should have listed them as:

dos/virus/scan97.zip
dos/virus/clean97.zip
etc...

To retrieve the files, send mail to "mail-server@jaflrn.uucp" containing
a line(s) patterned after the following for each file requested:

get dos/virus/scan97.zip

The files will be sent via return mail in uuencoded format.  A list of
all available files may be retrieved with the command "get index".

Sorry for the confusion!
