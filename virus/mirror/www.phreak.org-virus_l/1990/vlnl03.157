Subject: inherently secure operating systems

     I have recently been privately corresponding about a hypothetical
OS which is designed to have inherent anti-virus/worm/Trojan
capabilities.  That is, a ground-up design in which security is
designed as an integral part of the OS (the OS would not run without
it) not as an add-on or a modular feature.  This OS would not limit
the user of the computer, merely keep a watch on suspicous activity
(erasure of a disk by a program) and prevent it.  Perhaps it would
have an authorization code for each executable, or merely prevent
certain steps to be performed in sequence.  Anyway, the only thing
that it would keep the owner of the system from doing is tampering
with the OS itself, so it would not be some great dragon frustrating
the user at every move, or prevent customization.
     What I wish to know is: Does anyone out there want such a OS?
Would any of you be inclined to try it?  Is everyone satisfied with
installation of anti-viral programs?  Please respond to the address
below if you are intrigued.  I shall sum the answers at a later date
if there is a great interest.

Subject: Whale Virus Information (PC)

This is a forward from John McAfee:
=================================================================

	Fridrik Skulason posted an identification string for the Whale
virus (Mother Fish) in yesterday's Virus-L.  Unfortunately, the posted
string does not work.  Neither will any string, for that matter.  Even
a string allowing sophisticated wild card configurations will not
work.  The Whale virus is a new entity in the world of viruses.  It
uses multiple levels of encryption, each of which are continually
modified.  Unlike the V2Px series of variable encrypting viruses --
which used functionally similar but mechanically diverse decryption
routines, the Whale virus decryption routines seem to have nothing in
common with succeeding or preceding generations of the virus.  I spoke
with Fridrik shortly after his posting and he seems to have also come
to this same conclusion after further analysis.
	We have not delved into the inner workings of this virus as
much as some other investigators, but have instead focused on
detection and removal.  We have a reliable detector and disinfector at
this point, and it is available to anyone who is also working on this
virus (or anyone else, I guess, for that matter).  It should prove
helpful for containment and checking purposes, and is a lot faster and
more accurate than visual inspection.  We will fold this
detector/disinfector into SCAN for its next release.
	I'm afraid this virus represents a new and nasty turn in the
evolution of viruses.  Of the more than 9,000 bytes of code in the
virus, more than 7,000 bytes appear to be dedicated solely to avoiding
detection and removal.  It seems fairly effective.  I anticipate that
variations of this virus will shortly pose major problems to the
public domain.
	Anyone wanting a copy of the detector/disinfector should call
us (McAfee Associates) at 408 988 3832.  Or leave a message on the
HomeBase BBS - 408 988 4004.  Or drop us a fax - 408 970 9727.  Or
pick up a copy from Patti Hoffman, Kelly Goen, or anyone else who also
has a copy.

Subject: The 1559 Virus (PC)

Last year, I believe, the 1559 virus was sent out over VALERT by
accident. I was wondering if anyone has had any problems because of
it. I have found out that it activates on September 1st of the year
and therefore the damage would only be noticed now.

(This may have been already discussed in full, if so please do not
include this letter:)

Damage noticed by the 1559 Virus:

On exe files, file size is increased roughly by 1559 bytes.  Com files
don't seem to have their file size changed however they also get
infected (As does command.com)

The Virus' incubation period continues past september first, however,
on that date and beyond all sequential text files written (Or any file
written to) will be severely damaged....

SCANV66B was what I used to detect the virus however no safe cure is
out there (Or none that I am aware of)

Subject: SCANRES? (PC)

Hello,

I am in the process of developing an anti-virus strategy for the
MS-DOS PC's in use by the University of Connecticut.  As part of this
process, I am evaluating several anti-virus products.  I can't seem to
find a copy of McAfee's resident scanning program (SCANRES) for
evaluation.  It is not on SIMTEL20.

Does anyone know if it is still available?  And if so, from where?

Thanks,

Subject: Possibly Infected Commercial Virus Package! (PC)

     Yesterday I discovered 2 different viruses on a commercial virus
   program we purchased.  The viruses were on the original, write
   protected diskette.  I accidently discovered with when I ran SCAN62
   on my hard disk.  One file is infected with the 1701/1704 virus and
   another file is infected with both the 1701/1704 (Cascade, I think)
   AND the AIDS virus.  When the infected program was used to check
   the original disk it found nothing.  When scan was run on the disk
   it picked up both virues.  So far these viruses are just located
   on 3 floppy disks and one hard drive.  Are these partiularly mean
   viruses??  How come the commercial program couldn't pick up the
   viruses that were on it's own disk??  Scan picked up the viruses.

    				Thanks for any assistance.

Subject: Novell virus (PC)

A colleague in Montreal is concerned about possible Novell viruses.
I've been following the discussion on the list and read speculations
about stations potentially being able to infect the network, even if
they aren't privileged.

Since Sept 1, has there been any further traffic on this matter? Is
such a virus possible? What can be done to fight it?

Subject: "Bait", Distribution, Party ?

re Polish bait file, it would seem odd that someone would create a "bait"
   file of any length just to capture viruses. I generally use a 10h long
   .COM for such work (10h makes for simple offset calculation), though if
   in a hurry, a two-byte (CD 20) attractor is sufficient. An .EXE is just a
   matter of RENAME though you can get more complex if you want, the point
   is: why ? Consequently, I would be somewhat suspicious of anything more
   than a few bytes long. (I have seen a 155k trojan though)

Concerning distribution of viruses, in a word, no. Now if someone came
   recommended by a mutual acquantance with a legitemate reason (testing
   against anti-viral products is NOT sufficient), possibly, but since
   there are safer ways to simulate the activity, this would be preferred.
   The concerned people I deal with all require credentials and a strict
   non-dissemination agreement as well. To just freely grant access to any
   person requesting is certainly immoral and possibly illegal.

Since the NIST is a mandatory function, a central meeting point would seem
   appropriate, preferably one that operates on a similar schedule as most
   of us (non-realtime). An appearance by the legendary Gordius (sp?) would be
   interesting. Coat, tie, and spackle should be optional. Logic probes will
   be confiscated.

This question has been answered before, but since it is arising again,
it may be timely to repeat the answer.

A virus is a special case of a computer program.  It can do anything
that any other computer program can do.  While it must manifest some
characteristic special behavior to qualify as a virus, it cannot do
anything that any other program cannot do.

Thus, if your hardware can be programmed to damage itself, or will
damage itself in response to programmable behavior, then a virus can
damage it.

Of course, most hardware designers attempt to avoid this.  They try to
design the hardware such that it will not permanently damage itself in
response to programmed instructions.  In general they are successful.
There have been a limited number of failures.

For example, the original IBM Monochrome Adapter Card permitted you to
program the horizontal sweep rate.  If you set it to zero, and left it
in that state for a long period, you could burn out the monitor.

[There is a related problem of computer viruses that do things which make
the hardware temporarily unresponsive.  For example, some viruses have
been reported to damage the harddisk partition table.  While this does
not do permanent damage, it may appear to have done damage to the
hardware.]

There has been a great deal of speculation about viruses containing
such hardware damaging code, but no successful ones have been
reported.  Note that success of such a virus would not be demonstrated
by its ability to do such damage, but its success in both doing such
damage and also successfully replicating.  (I think that I am right in
saying that there are no successful biological viruses which are
universally fatal, at least not if they require their host for
replication and spreading.)

Since once a virus passes out of your hands, you have lost control over
it, and since virus epidemics begin from a single copy, the decision to
turn loose of one is very serious.  The consequences are potentially as
damaging as originating one.

Therefore, as a general rule, err on the safe side.  The author of the
question gives an example of a request from a stranger posted on a
bulletin board.  Certainly, no one should give a copy of a virus to a
stranger.  In the general case sending one to an unknown email address
would not be responsible.

Indeed, any such request should be viewed with alarm.  Those who have a
legitimate need and who can be trusted, are essentially known to each
other.  If I want admission to such a group, I would expect to have to
introduce myself by more appropriate and rigourous processes.

Subject: Re: Who should get what viruses

I have had additional thoughts on this subject.

Given the number of existing copies of Jerusalem B, I would likely
give copy to almost anyone who asked for it.  My giving a copy of such
a succesful virus to overtly and patently to someone who asks for it,
is not likely to have any substantial effect on the size of the
population of such copies, regardless of how they dealt with it.

I do not exercise any real control over Jerusalem B; it is out of
control.

On the other hand, suppose that I have the only copy of a virus.  Then
I have control.  If I turn over one copy, I loose control.

Thus, both who and what are relevant to the answer.

>Does anybody know something about OS/2 viruses ?

I hope that there is nothing to know.  I suspect that the population
of instances of OS/2 is still far too small to support sucessful
viruses.

>Will there be new possibilities to transport and/or hide
>viruses?

In all likelyhood.  OS/2 is significantly richer and more complex
than DOS.  For the moment it is also much more obscure.

>Has anybody already proved that there are new mechanisms
>possible,

Not to my knowledge, but nothing would surprise me.

>and if so: What can be done against them ?

A great deal.  The 80386, which OS/2 requires, provides multiple
states of privilege.  Thus, there can be mechanisms for fighting the
virus which the virus cannot see.  Such mechanisms can be much more
effective than those that we have in the 808X based systems.

>Did OS/2-Viruses already appear somewhere ?

I have not heard reports of any.  That may be evidence that there
are no reports, that no such viruses have been successful, or
that none have been attempted.
