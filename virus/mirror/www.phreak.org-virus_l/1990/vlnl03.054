VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

This is a myth, I think.  I can't think of any feature of the virus
that would help protect software from being pirated.  Viruses are
basically irrelevant to copy-protection.  DC

                        Hello everybody again!

        Unfortunately, it's already time for me to leave for Bulgaria.
It was really a delight to share with you.  I hope, that I was at
least a little useful for the computing society (is it true Ken?),
providing you with information about the nasties, developed in
Bulgaria.  Now you have even a package, that will protect you from
them (isn't it Frisk?).

        Unfortunately (again :-) ), there is no e-mail in Bulgaria.
However, you can still send me messages to this address.  For the next
two months there will be another person from Bulgaria here.  I've
instructed him how to receive my messages and how to store them on a
diskette.  When he returns in Bulgaria, he will bring them to me.

        For this time (2 months) I'll stay subscribed to VIRUS-L also
(OK Ken?).  That person (BTW, his name is Rumen Iankov) will
unsubscribe me when he leaves.

        Of course, this means that you'll have only a one-way contact
with me.  If you find this unsufficient, here is my postal mail
address:

                Vesselin Bontchev
                bl. 26, vh. "W", ap. 51
                ul. "Kestenova gora"
                kv. "Emil Markov"
                1404 Sofia
                Bulgaria

                Tel: (003592) 58-62-61

        Please note, that the mail is very slow and very unreliable in
Bulgaria.

        Oh, yes, and happy virus hunting!

                        Sincerely yours,
                                        Vesselin Vladimirov Bontchev

I don't think a PC equiped with a 3.5" drive can read a Mac formatted
disk.  A Mac formats the disk to 800K by using a variable speed
controller which puts more data on the outer rings of the disk than on
the inner ones.  I'm not sure if it's possible to override the ROM on a
PC, but this would be pretty extreme measures.  IMHO it's not really
neccessary to do this.

Again:
>After reading how the WDEF virus on the MAC propagates when an
>infected disk is inserted in the MAC,[...]

This is a misleading simplification.  WDEF spreads when a disk is
inserted if the Finder or MultiFinder is running (and when the disk is
opened).  If an application is running and not with MultiFinder, WDEF
doesn't spread it's infection.  So a Mac running Disinfectant (or a
commercial equivalent) w/o MultiFinder is quite capable of stopping
infections.

Subject: Bug in F-PROT (PC)

I would just like to warn the users of F-PROT 1.07 of a bug in the
F-SYSCHK program - it will fail to detect some viruses although they
are active in memory.

Version 1.08 (which I am sending out today) corrects this problem.

I have created a mailing list for anybody interested in receiving
updates to F-PROT by E-mail as soon as new viruses appear.

Drop me a note if you would like to be placed on the list.

If you can not handle XXencoded postings please let me know, and I'll
send you a copy of XXdecode.

Subject: request for virus info.

I am going to write a term paper on the threats of virsus to
computer security systems.  Is there any reference materials to this
topic?  Only a general survey plus some future trends is needed.
Personal opinions are welcomed.  Thanks.

Subject: Contest announcement

The National Center for Computer Crime Data notes with interest the
considerable controversy engendered by the trial and guilty verdict in
the case of Robert T. Morris.  In order to expand and focus the
conversation, we announce the "If I were the Robert Morris case judge"
essay contest.  We will award $100 to the best essay of 250 words or
less suggesting the appropriate sentence for Mr. Morris.

Security Magazine has agreed to publish the winning essay in its May
issue.  Contestants need not be familiar with the federal guidelines
for sentencing, but should assume, for the purpose of their essay,
that the judge can impose any sanctions he or she thinks reasonable.
All essays must be received by the National Center for Computer Crime
Data, 1222-B 17th Avenue, Santa Cruz, CA, 95062 by March 28, 1990.
