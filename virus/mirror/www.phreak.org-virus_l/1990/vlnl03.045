VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc., and sent to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, document, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: Upcoming Virus Conference

The 3rd Annual Computer Virus Clinic will be held on March 14-15
(Wednesday-Thursday) at the World Trade Center in New York City.
VIRUS-L followers may be interested to note that V-L moderator, Ken van
Wyk, will be one of speakers, along with such other virological
luminaries as Drs.  Harold J.  Highland and Fred Cohen.

The sponsor is the DPMA Financial Industries Chapter.  Information is
available via (800)835-2246 (voice!), or by mail to

          Box 894
          Wall Street Station
          New York, NY 10268

I understand 8 or so products will be shown, for those who like to see
the way things work, and there will be a reception at Windows on the
World after the sessions the first day.  There will be two session
"tracks," nominally Management and Technical (from what I've heard,
these names are misleading), and while the sessions will be more PC than
MAC oriented (when such a distinction applies; for example, the "How Do
You Test an Anti-Virus Product?" talk will cite DOS features and program
tools), MAC areas will be receiving adequate treatment.

In spite of one speaker known for his views that viruses are a fad, and
some speaker/topic pairs that seem to be at every virus conference (and
who will therefore sound very familiar to those who regularly go to
these things), it seems to be a potentially interesting meeting, more so
because of the potential of an open panel discussion (panelists as yet
unspecified) scheduled for the second day.

All "facts" above I have only heard from the man setting up the
conference; I've seen nothing in writing.  The 800 number should yield
yield more current information (and, I presume, information on travel,
lodging, etc.).

Subject: BRAIN, OHIO, SCANV57 (PC)

  Last night we discovered the Brain virus in one of our student labs.
As a precautionary measure, we now require that all students get their
diskettes certified by Computer Services before using them in our labs.
While scanning these disks, we have also discovered the OHIO virus.
  Now, for the clincher.  If the virus is active (The Brain virus),
SCANV57 will NOT discover it when it does it's memory check.  Nor will
it discover it in the BOOT sector of the infected diskette.  When the
machine is booted from a "clean" floppy, SCANV57 identifies the virus.
My question is: what is the point in scanning memory for a virus if it
will not pick up an active virus?

Subject: The 1559 virus (PC)

Hi!

Recently, the subscribers of VALERT-L received an uuencoded file which
(as the sender said) was infected with a new virus. Of course, sending
an infected file to a public (and non-moderated) forum is a big
mistake, but I won't emphasize this here.

[Ed. Absolutely agreed, and the sender has been told of his error.
Unfortunately, most of the copies had already been sent out by
then...]

Personally, I received at least 3 more messages, which warned me that
I *have* to delete this file and not to uudecode it. However, since
I'm an antivirus researcher, I couldn't resist to the temptation and
"test" the virus --- of course in a "safe" environment.

It turned out that the environment was too safe... I worked on a
computer with physically disabled hard disk.  I booted from a floppy,
containing only the operating system (PC-DOS 3.30), the infected file,
MAPMEM (a public-domain utility) and ANTI4US --- an interrupt
monitoring program --- much like FluShot+ but with much worse
interface.

I started the interrupt monitor and executed the infected file. Then I
executed MAPMEM. I wanted to (1) see if the virus can be "seen" in
memory with this utility and (2) confirm that the infected file is
"infective" i.e., contains  really  a  virus.  Of  course,  MAPMEM
didn't saw the beast.

Then I cold-rebooted from a new clear and write-protected diskette and
inspected the MAPMEM.COM file. Well, it wasn't infected at all! I
decided that I have received a damaged file and sent a message to the
author to send me a new file, consisting only of NOPs, infected with
the virus. He did so.

Further investigations showed that:

        - If I load ANTI4US and then run an infected program, the damn
          thing does not spread --- it ever does not try to infect
          files.

        - However, if I first run an infected program and then
          ANTI4US, the beast tries to spread (which is detected by
          ANTI4US) --- and of course infects ANTI4US.

At that point I was convinced that it is really a virus. Now I'm
trying to disassemble it and to write an antidote. Here is what I know
for the moment (without any warrant!):

        - The virus is memory resident. It installs itself in the
          memory at address 9800:0000. I couldn't find where (and if)
          it checks for the memory size.

        - The virus is 1554 bytes long, but may add more bytes (up to
          1569 I think) to the infected files.

        - Files are infected when they are executed (*not* when
          copied).

        - Both *.COM and *.EXE files can be infected.

        - COMMAND.COM can be infected --- if it is executed.

        - Files are infected only once.

        - The ReadOnly attribute won't help (you already guessed
          this :-) ).

        - The virus has its own critical error handler. Therefore an
          attempt to infect a file on a write-protected diskette won't
          display the usual "Abort, Retry, Ignore? " message.

        - The size of the infected files is such that always (SIZE mod
          16 == 2).

        - Only *.COM files greater than 1000 bytes will be infected. I
          couldn't find if there is a limit for the *.EXE ones.

        - The first 32 bytes of the *.COM files are overwritten. The
          original 32 bytes can be found at offset [14,15]*16+1015
          from the beginning of the file. Here [14,15] means the
          contents of the word at offset 14 (decimal) from the
          beginning of the file. I'm still trying to find how the
          virus infects *.EXE files.

DAMAGE:

        - The virus intercepts the WRITE function call (AH == 40h) of
          INT 21h.  If the month of the current date is 9 or greater,
          and if the write is on file handle > 4 (i.e., it is a "true"
          file, not stdin/out/err/aux/prn), then the address of the
          memory chunk which has to be written, is increased by 0Ah.
          This leads to garbage being written.

I haven't finished my work with this virus, but it's getting late and
I have to leave. Therefore, I decided to post what I know. Please, if
anyone knows more about this virus, send info to the forum too.

[Ed. As already noted, SCAN v 58 has been modified to detect this virus.]

      I realize that Mr. John Norstad just released Disinfectant 1.6
and has again announced that Disinfectant 2.0 is forthcoming, but has
he or his colleagues announced WHEN we can anticipate its release?
I'msure everybody is working hard on releasing it quickly, but I'm
just wondering what the timetable is.
      I also wanted to publically thank Mr. Norstad and his associates
for creating Disinfectant, for making it free, and for keeping it

I believe that one of the reasons for the swift spread of WDEF is that it
doesn't require the Launch of a program to infect a target system.  WDEF
spreads simply by inserting an infected disk into an uninfected machine
(clever bit of design work there, actually...)

Also, WDEF is not recognized by much of the current generation of "Virus
Protection" software, e.g. SAM (versions prior to 1.4), Virex (versions
prior to 2.3), etc.  Many people seem to have the impression that once
they've installed any version of a virus catcher, they're protected for
life...

Subject: Mosaic and FontFinder Trojans (MAC) -- Update #2

10 Feb 1990, the trigger date for these trojans, has come
and gone. I have heard no reports of further attacks by
either of these trojans.

These nasties would appear to be fairly localized based on
the lack of additional attacks. But the speed with which the
warning was spread and the general lack of panic suggests
that we have a very effective tool with which to combat
these electronic vandals.

I think that everyone who helped relay the warnings (and
from the comments and queries I received, the warning was
truly spread worldwide) deserves a hearty "Well Done".

My thanks to all those who assisted and "passed the word".
If you hear of any future sightings or attacks from either
of these trojans, I would appreciate it if you would contact
me directly...

        At a *random* interval, without providing any means of

        Several companies sent off the license fee *AS DIRECTED*,
        They waited several weeks for a response, and getting none,
        decided to use the programs - 'cause they *DID* pay the
        "license fee"  --- it still blew away their computers!

        Incorrect - several did read the "license" and abide by its
        terms -- the creator of the program did not abide by his
        (implied) end of the deal by insuring that the program
        *ONCE PAID FOR* would not harm the users system....

        Also Incorrect!  The US Intervention in Panama did not disrupt
        the mail system nearly as much as it did other aspects of life
        in that place (btw - political commentary should be sent

        In as much as there is *NO LEGAL ENTITY* as PC Cyborg,
        there is NO LICENSE.  A license is a contract.  There must
        be two legally valid parties to a valid contract.  There is
        no "PC Cyborg" in a legal sense, therefore, there is no
        binding license.

Well, some anti-virus programs do this.  In general they are faster
than other programs, but when a new variant of a virus appears, they
are unable to detect it.  But you are right - at least they would not
report other anti-virus programs as infected.

Here we go again....

The Halting Problem and UVD problem are indeed unsolvable on a Turing
machine, but they are theoretically (but not in practice) solvable on
a "real-vorld" computer.

There are some limitations, however - the machine needed to solve the
problem must be many orders of magnitude larger than the machine the
program is running on.

AFCAC contract...
Other Government contracts...
Where to find computer 'deals'
Virus breakouts and how to stop them.
Chat from vendors...
Hardware/software problems - solutions.
TCP/IP logins and where to find needed files.  Also for those who
do not have TCP/IP maybe we can setup a re-distributor system.
Interviews with AT&T and other computer experts.
etc..

This is open to all Government employees of any and all systems and
OSs.  Because this is on-line there will be no 'paper' mailings due to
cost.

If interested contact me at:

True and false.  You would have to extract them with in/out
instructions BUT, you could store some code there, enough to do
damage, say a jump to format a track....It is small enough, or perhaps
a decryption routine, like the 8 code wonder in the 4096 virus, or....

BTW, did you know that you can download code from the KEYBOARD?  IBM
uses it apparently to generate some test code, and squirt it into
memory.  Now, granted, one would have to burn the nasty into rom in
the keyboard, but some one could convievably do that at the factory.
I think that the POS queries the keyboard, I'd have to go back and
look at the tech ref manual.  It might even be possible, to
dissasemble the keyboard roms and find some backdoor that you could
use to store code.  Not much use, but has at least the potential of
