There is a conflict with Sam 2.0.0, MS Mail, and a start-up screen.
Either
	1) Upgrade to SAM 2.0.2b
	2) Rename MS Mail and/or SAM so MS Mail INIT's before SAM
	3) delete the start-up screen
	4) Patch the WDEF on MS Mail so that the WDEF (#16) has the
	   system Heap check box on (Use Get Info and ResEdit)

Microsoft Mail also has a problkem with MacMainframe from Avatar.
	A rename of INIT's fixes this also.
Sam also reacts to MacPassword in a fashion similar to MS Mail.

Thanks to all, and esp. Paul "Mr. SAM" Cozza.

Subject: False alarm using scan v62 (PC)

When i start scan from the command line of the Norton Commander V2.0 ,
i get an alarm that the 1701/1704 Virus is active in memory, but
scanning all files on my harddisk, there is no infected file .

I'm using a NEAT 286 Motherboard running at 10 MHz , a Seagate ST-225
20 Mb Har ddisk, a Tseng EVA/1024 8 Bit VGA card with 512 kb memory,
all that stuff under PC-DOS 4.00.

When i use an earlier version of scan , fe. V48 , no alarm comes up.

Anyone out there in the wild, wild world knowing what's going on ?

                                            Awaiting good ideas,

I agree with what you are saying, but is there a better way to word
these definitions?  What happened to the word "autonomous" instead of
independent?

autonomous - adjective: Independent; self-contained.  - American
Heritage dictionary.

Here is my attempt at more accurate definitions:

Virus - A section of code which has the ability to attach copies of itself to
        other programs in a manner which when these infected programs are
        executed, the virus code is executed as well as the original program.

Worm - An autonomous program which has the ability to copy itself to a new
       physical location and then execute this new copy as a separate
       concurrent process.

Trojan horse - an autonomous program with a hidden agenda disguised as a
               program to do something desirable.

notes: 'program' may mean a set of integrated programs with a common
       purpose.

       'new physical location' may or may not be on a different cpu.

New Virus "1022"

One of our networks has been infected by a virus.
It is not detectable by SCAN V63.

Symptoms:
Only infects .EXE files, adding 1022 bytes to them
Infects files even if they are r/o
Changes the date on the files it infects to the current system date.
It appears that after running the first infected .EXE it starts
up a TSR that carries out further infection

Detection:
running STRINGS on an infected file reveals :

This message is dedicated to  $
all fellow PC users on Earth  $
  Towards A Better Tomorrow   $
And A Better Place To Live In $
 03/03/90 KV KL MAL

[There is no CR/LF after the $ character - I added this
so that the message is readable]

Also detection might be done by looking at the date/time change
on the infected files

To scan all your files (until a version of SCAN is produced which
   detects this virus):
GREP -d+ dedicated *.EXE
[The GREP I used is the one that comes with Turbo Pascal]
[I chose "dedicated" for the search string as it is the most
 unique word in the message]

Damage:
Unknown at this stage

Removal :
Restore the .EXE from backup

Subject: Troubles with CLEAN from McAfee (PC)

During the summer I'm working at a big computer software development
company here in Vienna.  Like everytime I came there detecting viruses
all over our office's PC.  It's allways the same old foe, the 1704
Virus (Cascade , Falling Letters,etc).  It is almost impossible to
detect it without scanning for viruses, because the trigger date of
the versions floating around in Austria has never been changed from a
unfriendly hacker( original it is 1980 , or Oct to Dec 1988), so the
virus only infects everything as much as it can , but never starts its
'work'.

Allways up to date , i decided to remove it with CLEAN from John
McAffee, because i thought it would do the job quick and clean.
Fortunately, I copied all of the infected files to a floppy disc, to
have a 'backup' if problems would appear.  And they did |||

1)On bigger COM-files , the original jump instruction has not been
restaurated correctly, some junk like (20,18,32) stood there, so
naturally the computer hanged up,

2) or about 3 quarters of the files were simply deleted , for example the
COM-file of Microsoft Chart 4.0 cut down from about 56 Kb to 9 Kb.

Expecting a possible error only in this version of CLEAN (V58), i tried
a newer one (V61) , the same junk appeared after the 'cleaning'.

In February i had to remove the same virus , but at that time i only
had good old M-1704 (also from John McAffee) , which changed the date
of all files th actual date / time , but worked well.

3) also CLEAN ended its run after cleaning 15 files, to heal 40 files i had
to start it 3 times.

Has anybody detected the same problems ?

Disinfectant 2.0
================

July 8, 1990

Disinfectant 2.0 is a major new release of our free Macintosh
anti-viral utility.

The main goal of version 2.0 is to provide a complete and free
solution to the Macintosh virus problem in a single package (in
fact, in a single file). Version 2.0 addresses all four aspects
of the virus problem: detection, repair, protection, and
education.

Version 2.0 includes a new virus protection startup document
(INIT). The INIT is designed for use by novices and others who
find existing protection INITs to be too complicated and
obtrusive.

Version 2.0 has a much-improved online manual, with pictures,
printing, a context-sensitive help system, and many new sections
of information.

Version 2.0 is a non-modal application with standard windows and
menus. It supports desk accessories, printing, MultiFinder
application switching, and scanning in the background.

There is a new Preferences window which can be used to specify
miscellaneous options and parameters.

Other new features include more scan and disinfect options, new
counters in the main window, and a much-improved scanning
station feature.

Version 2.0 also recognizes the Frankie virus. Frankie only
affects some kinds of Macintosh emulators running on Atari
computers.

Disinfectant 2.0 is available now via anonymous FTP from site
acns.nwu.edu [129.105.49.1].  It will also be available soon on
sumex-aim.stanford.edu, rascal.ics.utexas.edu,
comp.binaries.mac, CompuServe, GEnie, Delphi, BIX, MacNet,
America Online, Calvacom, AppleLink, and other popular sources
of free and shareware software.

Macintosh users who do not have access to electronic sources of
free and shareware software may obtain a copy of Disinfectant by
sending a self-addressed stamped envelope and an 800K floppy
disk to the author at the address below. People outside the US
should send an international postal reply coupon instead of US
stamps (available from any post office). Please use sturdy
envelopes, preferably cardboard disk mailers.

One small nit, just in case this list is being read by someone
in the media!   *8)  The virus contains some code that's designed
to cause a branch to a nasty place in BIOS if one single-steps
through a particular early part of the virus.   But anyone
skillful enough to use a debugger is almost certainly skillful
enough to detect what the virus is trying to do, and prevent it.
A more accurate description, to avoid giving the virus more
credit than it deserves, might be:

  Contains easily-avoidable code that's intended to
    make analysis more difficult, but in fact has no
    particular effect.

Subject: A Revised Computer Espionage Law?

>From The Washington Post, 5 July 1990:

                   A Revised Computer Espionage Law?

   Change Would Allow Prosecution of Whistle-Blowers and Journalists

          By George Lardner Jr., Washington Post Staff Writer

    The Bush administration is seeking a change in the federal computer
espionage law that would open the door to prosecution and conviction of
whistle-blowers and journalists as well as spies.

    The Justice Department said the proposal would make the espionage
law "more useful."  It would eliminate a provision in current law
requiring proof of espionage and make it a crime simply to use -- or
cause the use of -- a computer to obtain classified information without
authorization.

    The penalties would be the same as they are now.  Violators would
be subject to ten years in prison for a first offense, or "an attempt to
commit such an offense."  Second offenders could be sent away for twenty
years.

    The proposal was submitted to Congress last month by Acting
Assistant Attorney General Bruce C. Navarro as part of a package of
changes in the computer fraud and abuse statute of 1986.  It has drawn
a frosty reception from lawmakers with jurisdiction over the issue.

    "It seems they want to make far more people spies than actually
are," said Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House
Judiciary subcommittee on criminal justice.

    Under the current computer espionage law, it is a felony for
anyone knowingly to gain unauthorized access to a computer and obtain
classified information "with the intent or reason to believe that such
information so obtained is to be used to the injury of the United
States, or to the advantage of any foreign nation."

    The Justice Department wants to drop the "intent or reason to
believe" clause.

    Although the clause is a staple of traditional espionage laws dating
back to 1917, the Justice Department contends that it "has so narrowed
the application of the computer espionage provision as to render it
virtually useless."

    Taking it out, Justice officials said in a section-by-section
analysis, would establish a "new computer crime offense, which merely
requires proof that the person obtained certain information, and
not that he delivered it or transmitted it to any other person or
government."  Prosecutors would then have "another weapon for combating
the increasing number of espionage cases."

    Another part of the Justice Department package that drew criticism
was a provision that would define information in a computer, as well
as processing time, as "property."

    "The thrust of that is to say that is if you take information,
that's property and you can be accused of stealing," Schumer said.  "I
think that's very dangerous.  We need a law more finely honed than that."

    Morton Halperin, Washington director of the American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU), said the proposals call to mind the controversial 1985
prosecution of former naval intelligence analyst Samuel Loring Morison,
the first person convicted under espionage laws for leaking documents
"relating to the national defense" to the news media.

    Morison was found guilty of espionage and of theft of government
property for leaking three spy satellite photographs that were
classified secret to a British magazine.  He also was convicted on
separate espionage and theft charges for taking portions of two other
Navy documents, also classified secret, and keeping them in an envelope
at his Crofton, Md., apartment.

    Morison's lawyers contended that the sections of espionage law used
in the case were meant to apply only in a clandestine setting, to spies
and saboteurs, and not to disclosures to the news media.  As for the
theft charges, they protested that making the law applicable to
government "information" would give the executive branch unbridled
discretion to control what the public may be told.

    An advocate of bigger defense budgets and a supporter of president
Ronald Reagan, Morison contended that he sent the magazine satellite
photos, which showed the first Soviet nuclear aircraft carrier under
construction at a Black Sea shipyard, primarily because he was
interested in publicizing the Soviet threat.  He was sentenced to two
years in prison.

    Under the Justice Department's computer espionage proposal, it
could be even more dangerous to take the secrets from a computer than
to get them on paper.  The bill would make it a crime to pluck from a
computer any "classified" information, even items stamped secret, because
disclosure would be embarassing.  That is a much broader category than
documents "relating to the national defense."

    Halperin said that the ACLU would strongly oppose any such change in
the law.  "Given the amount of information that is classified and the
degree to which debate in the United States depends on that information,
we have consistantly oppsed criminalizing access to classified
information by private citizens, except where it involves transfer to
foreign powers," Halperin said.

    Justice Department official acknowledged that their proposal would
cover whistle-blowers and journalists.

    "No one considered that in the drafting of it," said Grace L.
Mastalli, special counsel in Justice's Office of Policy Development.
But she said it was "probably not possible to narrow it without
destroying the purpose of the bill."

Subject: Problems with McAfee's VSHIELD and MS Word (PC)

I have experienced problems with PS/2-50's running VSHIELD versions
62B and 64 when using Microsoft Word v5 and the PS/2 mouse. The
machine frequently hangs up. Sometimes the mouse cursor continues to
move and CAPSLOCK, etc., lights go on working, in which case the
machine can be reset using CTL/ALT/DEL. On other occasions, there is
no keyboard or mouse response and the machine has to be turned off.

The problem can be made to occur quite quickly by using the mouse to
control Word. This happens with no other TSRs loaded other than
VSHIELD and does not happen when it isn't loaded.

Has anyone else experienced these problems?
