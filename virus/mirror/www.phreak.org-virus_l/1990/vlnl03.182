One of the first things I would do is to have your PC checked out from
a Hardware standpoint. The next step would be to have the power in
your building checked out. After 5+ years in the PC repair field ( 2
with a ZDS Dealer) I've seen many strange things happen because of
power problems.

When checking out the power in the building I would recommend using a
line monitor, with a paper tape preferably, inline with the PC in
question.  The next best choice would be a UPS, while these won't tell
you what the condition of the power is, they will beep when the power
fails and they usually supply a well regulated voltage output.

Good luck,

Alex

P.S.
    Don't completely rule out a software problem.  You might want to
    try to RE-SYS your Hard drive.  If this solves your problem let me
    know.

Robert: this really isn't the right place for me to do tech support,
so please feel free to call me at (212)-889-6431 or FAX me at
(212)-889- 9730 for future tech support.

This sounds like an interesting kinda problem, though: is your
FLUSHOT.DAT file > 2048 bytes (sounds unlikely with only 15 program
entries)? What program does it appear to hang on (during the checksum
scan)?

I'll have to ask you some more questions before I can help further,
but I'm always available for tech support at the above number(s).

Finally, you should also coinsider updating to Version 1.81, the most
recent version. It has some extra security, some bug fixes and a nifty
scan program, a demo of my commercial VIREX-PC product's scanner.

Subject: Disinfectant / VirScan for IBM-PC ??? (PC)

Where can I get a program against IBM PC viruses?
Is there something like Disinfectant for the Mac?

I would prefer something, that is

- - PD or ShareWare
- - updated regularly
- - free of OWN viruses
- - easy to get from a SAVE place

I know, that IBM has a VirScan program. There are two versions:

- - the version they sell
- - the internal version

The commercial version lacks far behind the internal one. Naturally, since it
takes a long time from development to the counter!

So is there any possibility for nonIBMers to download a SAVE copy of the
internal VirScan version?

Thanx for all infos .................................................  Didi

It can, and was done.  The Commodore drives are intellegent.  There
are several buffers in ram, that can be freely written to.  A
knowlegeable Commodore hacker can do this quite easily, and very
simply infect a program.  There were several protection schemes based
on this very thing.  a program was downloaded into the drives ram.
Rather easy to do with a disk read, and then a buffer transfer
command.  These routines then hooked one of the multitude of hooks
into the system, and proceeded to veto copies etc.  Way back in 1980,
I was selling Commodore computers, and installing them.  I may have
some sample code hanging around somewhere, but I don't know where.  I
do have the source for the old 4040 roms, and have looked at it quite
a bit in those days.

Yes, it can be done.

When the commodore computers were really common, viruses were essentially
unknown.

Got some comments/questions that maybe some of you can help with.

Ross:  Do the antiviral sites that carry FSP need to send a registration/
       distribution form in?  I wouldn't think so, but decided to get it
       straight from you.  Also, what is the latest version out?

General:  I have a file called VIKIT404.ZIP, which seems to be some sort
          of antiviral software.  However, the docs are in Italian.  Does
          anyone know the file and/or care to translate the docs?  I do not
          want to place it on MIBSRV until I know something more about it.
          Interested?  Email me direct.

Subject: Strange Behavious (Virus?) On Novell LAN

XT and AT class PC's running MS-WORD version 5.0B on an Advanced
Netware 286 Version 2.15c LAN in Seattle have either 'crashed' while
attempting to save the document they were working on, or have received
a message saying:
  "You SHOULDn't print this file"
when they attempt to print it...  This started on 1-Nov-90, (I noticed
thhalloween notice a couple days back) and thought i would report this
as well.

Other known symptoms so far have been: At least 2 unrelated executable
files have been 'altered'.  Unfortunately, several users had
SUPERVISOR priv's.  The executable file MENUPARZ.EXE (in the PUBLIC
directory) had several chunks of it 'zeroed'.  It's date and size were
not changed, only it's contents.  It was flagged as ROS.  (But with
SUPERVISOR priv's, you can do anything, right?)

I was contacted in an attempt to 'quantify' what was going on.
All comments are appreciated!

Uh... not meaning to tell anyone how to write one, but there are drive
commands that will do just that: store something in the drive's
memory. It isn't particularly more difficult than loading a virus into
the computer's main memory, in fact. A program with the virus would
have to be executed before the virus could become active, but that's
nothing new... :( The RAM in my PC clone is cleared when the computer
is turned off, but that doesn't make it virus-proof either.

It's maybe a good thing that the documentation for the C64's disk
drive was so lousy.

No kidding... if you've ever looked at any of the programming
information for GEOS, you'll see it's full of holes.

I suspect the base of C64s in active use is too small at this point to support
a virus. So it's rather a dead issue...

Dave Goodwin <GOODWIN@SMCVAX.BITNET> asks about side-effects of the
Dark Avenger virus.  It's a potentially rather nasty one; on something
like every 16th execution of an infected program, a more-or-less
random sector on the disk is overwritten with 512 bytes of garbage
beginning with the string "Eddie lives".  You might want to use some
sector-string-search program to look for that string...  DC

A week ago one of the PC's in the chromatography department started to
act up, going frequently into a re-boot. A quick check with McAffee's
SCAN57 showed a massive contamination of .COM files with VIENNA A.

As this PC is used only as dedicated service station, the
contamination could easily be traced back to original diskettes of the
software for the Shimadzu Photodetection Detector SPD-M6A, Version
2.14, which arrived a few months back. As this was an update, the
older version 2.12 was checked, which is clean. Same contamination was
found in the original diskettes of a second station in a different
department, which had gotten version 2.14 independently.

Company representatives of Shimadzu was notified, he claims that
company is not source of virus infection. Collected infected disks and
replaced them with clean version.  :-)

Has anyone else seen this infection of Shimadzu software? Any other
gas chromatographic software?

It has been a while since I looked at this one but there are at least
two strains: one which is a normal TSR detectable with MAPMEM, and the
other is in upper memory detectable with CHKDSK. It is quite nasty and
fast- spreading. After a certain delay (xx files infected) it will
start corrupting files by writing a copy of a low disk sector into
random locations on the disk. It does not use any "stealth" mechanisms
not does it affect the boot sector or partition table. Infected files
grow by c.a. 1800 bytes.

Some time ago I "fixed" COMMAND.COM so that a batch shell could not be
aborted. All that is necessary is to find the "Terminate Batch Job
(Y/N)?"  string, back up to the INT 21 call that prints it, and then
change the preceeding branch (JN if I rember right) to a JMP. It is a
touch more difficult to remove the "system" feature from software
packages, but possible.

This seems to be a common mythconception about the Jerusalem but good
practise nonetheless. I suspect a direct invocation of INT 19 with
POST would have the same effect (but haven't tried it).

Have seen this happen more than once & can be very nasty. Separate
directories are essential. Network administrators need special
training & tools. (editorial)

It is not well documented, but if the directory files in SETUP
(sft-F1,6) are left blank, WP will work in the current default
directory. Typically, we just point the DOCUMENTS entry this way, but
any of the others should also work. This will give you more freedom in
location.

Original-To:        JUAN JOSE CARMENA <ALPHACO@vm1.uam.ES>

In Virus-L Volume 3 Number 171 on 17 October there was your request
from 17 Oct 90 for information about "PC-cillan."

Steve Chang, president of Trend Micro Devices of Torrence CA, send us
an evaluation copy of his product since he wanted a product
endorsement.  The product consists of software and hardware [a dongle]
- -- a unit that must be attached to the parallel port.

This dongle has two problems from my viewpoint.  Its function is
nothing more than to copy the hard disk's MBR [partition table and
boot record], something that is easily done with Norton Utilities,
PCTools, Mace and the Kolod package.  Besides having the MBR on a
floppy disk is safer than trusting an "attachment" to the micro.
Unfortunately this dongle has no way to secure it to the port.  If
some joker removes it, the so-called security offered by the product
is gone.

If you had 30 of these in an office or lab and the joker shifted them
around among the machines, think of the problem you'd have to find the
right dongle for each machine!

Furthermore, the software is promoted as protecting the user against
any known and FUTURE viruses.  We class such items as Ponce de Leon
follies -- promises of eternal youth -- of utopia!

Within the last month Mr Chang sent out a press release in which the
product was endorsed by John McAfee who noted that it was one of the
best he had seen.  High praise from an author who fails to include
mention of most anti-virus products in his book.

In our conversation with Mr Chang he claimed the product was widely
sold in Asia and Europe and was now making it available in the States.

In the late 1940's there was a company, Wit's End, a printer and
greeting card producer.  Their stationary was printed on brown kitchen
paper towels.  On it was a saying from Mark Twain:

    "Be thankful for the fools for without them we could not exist."

You must of heard of our famous American showman Phineas Taylor Barnum
[1810-1891] who ran circus sideshows exhibiting animals and freaks.
At one he had large signs reading "This way to the Great Egress."
After the people passed through the curtained opening and walked
through a maze, they found themselves outside of the exhibit area.
Anyone who complained was told that "Egress" was another word for
"exit" and that Mr. Barnum was not responsible for their lack of
education.

The Wall Street Journal and other newspapers ran stories about anti-
virus product hyperbole.  As a good friend of mine recently put it:
"Barnum is not really dead!"  He is probably selling anti-virus
products!
