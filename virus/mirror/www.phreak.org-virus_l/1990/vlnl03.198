Call for Papers - 14th National COmputer Security Conference

VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

We're having a very weird problem here at the office...

Our keyboards keep going into 'Warp Mode', meaning that the key repeat rate
keeps going VERY VERY high...you hold down a key for half a second and the
result is many many consecutive keyclicks.  Normally a reboot will
cure this for a while at least.  We're using 386 clones with hard
drives, both two different types of computers...I'm using an HP Vectra.
At first I thought that maybe it was something we are both using causing
this problem...but the only things we use commonly are Turbo C++ and
maybe one or two common utilities.  Could a virus be causing this?
Does this symptom sound familiar?

    I think the problem here is that you must re-build the Desktop and
then make sure the virus is not active in memory.  To do that, simply
re-start.  You CAN get rid of WDEF by re-building the Desktop; we do
it here all the time.  But WDEF is a persnickity little thing, and it
spreads quickly back to your hard drive from any floppies you have
that still have it, and from anyone else's infected floppy, all at the
insertion of the disk.

    We recommend GateKeeper Aid to our users.  It completely removes
WDEF whenever it sees it; no action on the part of the user is
necessary.  So you throw GateKeeper Aid in your System folder, re-boot,
and insert all your floppies once, and you know you haven't got WDEF,
and that you can't get it again as long as you've got GateKeeper Aid.

Subject: U.S. sighting of ZUC B (Mac)

ZUC B has been detected on the Cornell campus.  The vector was a
student who had just returned from Italy, where ZUC seems to have
originated.  An alert operator in one of our public facilities was
checking a diskette, and the patron mentioned having been in Italy.
Our person scanned with his freshly downloaded Disinfectant 2.4 and up
popped ZUC B.  So, we may have nipped this one in the bud.  All the
same, this serves as a cautionary tale: Keep your virus-fighting
software up-to-date, even if the newest version is just for an obscure
or foreign virus.

Note that Disinfectant 2.4, released Dec 3, is needed to detect ZUC B.
Version 2.3 will not find this virus.

No...no...no...

Remember - if the program is infected after it is LZEXEd, then the
virus will be activated first, when the program is executed.  If it is
a "stealth" type virus, the LZEXE self-test is useless, as the
infected program will appear uncorrupted.

On the other hand, if the program is first infected, and then LZEXEd,
the main effect will be that the majority of current anti-virus
programs will not detect the virus. McAfee's SCAN will, and my own
F-PROT, but I know of no other programs capable of scanning
LZEXE-packed files.

This is a nice program, but not of much use against viruses...

The complete report described in yesterday's front page article in The
Washington Post (and in an inside pager in the New York Times) is
terrific.  It is called COMPUTERS AT RISK and is published by the
National Research Council.  The panel that put it together is
top-notch, and the 303 page report describes the whole world of
computer security, with viruses as a (small) subset; the technical,
administrative, and policy aspects are all covered well.  The report
is available from the National Academy Press, 2101 Constitution Ave
NW, Washington DC 20418 (though I drove down and bought my copy at the
Press' bookstore at 2001 Wisconsin Ave NW (they were running out, but
expecting another shipment yesterday afternoon, so supposedly they
have them now; you can call and ask first).  I'm sure there are better
ways for those not in driving distance, but I don't know what they
are.  The book costs $19.95.

Subject: New Virus? (The Invader?) (PC)

   I got word today of a possible new virus that was apparently deliberaty
spread around at the Canadian Computer Show. As I have not heard or seen
any postings of a simular virus I thought I'd post a description here to
see if anyone knows anything about it.
   The virus apparently infects the CMOS on an AT, changing the drive type
after an incubation period, and the locking out the hard drive. It can be
spread by running a program from an infected disk (how disks are infected
is unknown, nor is it know if a particular program is the source).
  According to one distributor that got hit, the only way to remove the
virus is to disconect the AT board from the battery backup and to wipe the
BIOS on the hard disk controler. This may be a little extreme, but I have
yet to see an infected machine.
    Apparently there is also a message displayed when the virus becomes
active, calling the virus 'THE INVADER'.
  Does this sound simular to any know virus? Does SCAN pickup the virus, and
if so which version? Is there a simpler way to remove the virus from an
infected machine?   Any help would be appreciated. I should get a copy of
an infected disk on monday and may have more information then.

There are a couple of problems with this.  One is that if you compress an
infected program, you end up with a compressed, infected program.

The second is that, as with the discussion on CRC checkers earlier, a
stealth virus simply "lies" to any checking or authentication routine.

One additional problem is that programs which already have "self chekcing
built in will fail because of the compression and addition of the
decompression module.

Subject: Anti-virus Plus (PC)

I tend to use Word Perfect's "Files List" feature to move files around on
the disk, and to make up floppies.  I was doing just that, when I got a
message that I had been "running an infected file.  PREVENT1 has removed
the infection."

This was a little odd, since Word Perfect is one of the commercial
programs that does it's own self check.  Not proof against a stealth
virus, of course, but still, it would be an unlikely candidate for
infection.

PREVENT1 had dumped me back at the DOS prompt, so I did a quick F-SYSCHK.
 Nothing.  I F-FCHKed, SCANned and VPCSCANned the WP51 directory, with no
results.  (VPCSCAN is the scanning portion of Virex-PC, written by Ross
Greenburg of Flu-Shot fame.  Let me say in passing that it is *FAST*.)

Then I got to thinking.  One of the files I had been trying to delete was
a .COM file.  So I tried it again.  Same result.  I tried deleting a few
other types of files.  No problems with anything but a .COM or an .EXE.
I got sneaky and renamed MOVE.COM to MOVE.TXT.  PREVENT1 didn't like that
either, so it's pretty sneaky itself.

PREVENT1 does not interfere with PCTOOLS deletion of program files, and I
don't know what the difference would be, although I assume PCTOOLS would
use a "deeper" call to do it's deletions than WP would.  So Antivirus
Plus is making some assumptions, generally valid, about what some
programs should be doing with other program files.  A way to catch
unknown viri, perhaps, but it may interfere with operations you want to
do if, like me, you use programs for things they were never meant to do.

I wonder, too.  I have seen this and another strange thing with
WordPerfect:  floppy disks' FATs get completely scrambled.  It
could be user error, but at least some of the half-dozen users
I've seen this happen to are too competent to pull this sort of
screwup on their own.

You don't mention what version of WP you're using or what the
overall environment is.  Our problems started with the
installation of WP 5.1 on a Novell Netware LAN.  SCAN has not
turned up anything.  WP being the hog it is, and somewhat new to
the network world, I more than half suspect that this is a
memory-allocation bug in WP.  Or else it's user error.   As I
told a user's group the other day, the only way we'll find out
is by all of us taking notes and sharing them.

I purchased a Packard Bell Pack-Mate 386X in September, so the VALERT
message caused me to immediately check my system.

McAfee Scan v71 claimed that both disks mentioned (ComBase and the VGA
Utility) were clean.  I then went into the boot sectors of both with
Norton Utilities, and found the DOS error messages at Sector 0,
Cylinder 0, Offset 377.

At least some of the PB systems are not infected with MusicBug.

Here are some corrections for the info that was given at:vol 3 iss 191
The file contain a virus now named: The Saddam Virus
The only bad activity it does is when you do Del with any parameter
it will do Del *.* by mistake or delibately.

BTW: latest scan is SCAN71B
PS: not long time ago I posted the virus desc. if some1 wants I have

   I am looking for software that runs under xenix yet will detect

under xenix (no VP/ix available:-( to scan uploads to DOS file areas.
Pointers towards pd, shareware, or commercial solutions -- C source or

	Werner:

	Thanks for forwarding that info to me about SAM and MS Mail.
	Please forward the below info to the appropriate forum.

				Paul

There was a compatibility conflict between MS Mail 2.0 and early
versions of SAM 2. This compatibility problem was correctable at that
time by simply having MS Mail run before SAM. I made changes to SAM to
avoid the conflict. These were incorporated in SAM 2.0.2B which was
released last May or so.

Since then I have heard nothing of any SAM/MS Mail problem.

SAM doesn't touch data files, nor have I heard of it randomly
crashing.  I suspect the problem to be MS Mail since the problem was
verified to have also occurred on machines running without SAM.

Hello netters,

I'm relative new to this newsgroup and the subject, but I didn't
read anything about virusses in UNIX here. But I still will give it a try.

I have the following questions:
	- Are there any virus detectors for UNIX virusses. If yes, where
	  can I find them.

	- where can I get more information about UNIX virusses (I prefer
	  information on Motorola oriented machines).

Thanks in advance.
