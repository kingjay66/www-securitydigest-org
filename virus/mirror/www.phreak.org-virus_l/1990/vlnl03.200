We resolved 99 percent of the scrambled FATs in WP 5.0 this way:
disable the automatic save feature of WordPerfect. It is better anyway
to train users to back-up often their data under the name they want
instead of training them how to recuperate a backed-up file (they
never remember how to do that).

There were two situations causing the FAT problems:
1. Novell network, stand-alone WP 5.0 version, dos 3.3, clone PCs
   automatic back-up, workstations without hard disks (floppies only).
   (can't remember anymore if the back-up was creating a file on the
   server or on the user's floppy).
2. Stand-alone PCs (clones), dos 3.3, two-floppy version of WP 5.0,
   automatic back-up unto a floppy.

In both cases, we couldn't isolate the exact sequence of event leading
to the scrambled FATs but it is related to "asking WP to do to many
tasks at the same time" such as printing, saving and editing all at
the same time and maybe to the dangerous procedure of changing floppy
at the wrong time (such as when you're looking at a directory with F5
and changing floppy without going back to your document first).

  This is unlikely. Any decent BIOS will have a way to get into the CMOS
config at cold boot time. The parameters can then be set well enough to
boot from your recovery floppy and restore the CMOS you saved when you
made the disk, right before you write protected it.

  A number of programs to save and restore CMOS are on archives and have

  If you think about it, there is such a tiny market for this that a

  What you need is VP/ix, and the best virus detectors you can get.

Subject: PhD/MS in computer security

Here is something to add to your list about grad programs in security:

At Purdue, we have three faculty members with strong interests in
computer security:
   *  Gene Spafford, author of numerous articles and a book on
      computer viruses and vandalware, coauthor of a book on Unix
      security.  He's an external affiliate of the CERT.  He's
      the faculty member who directed the development of COPS.
   *  Samuel Wagstaff, a well-known cryptographer and number theorist
      who has written numerous articles on cryptography and number
      theory.  Sam is well known in the security community.
   *  Richard DeMillo, author of many articles on cryptography and
      security protocols, and coauthor/editor of books on computer
      security and software testing.  DeMillo is also director of
      the Software Engineering Research Center.

There are other faculty members who have some non-primary interest in
security of databases (Ahmed Elmagarmid, Bharat Bhargava), and
operating systems and networks (Doug Comer, Vince Russo).

Masters degrees in CS at Purdue are non-designated, consisting of
coursework or coursework and a thesis.  The coursework can include
coursework in Cryptography and Data Security, special topics in
Computer Vandalware, and advanced software engineering techniques.  An
MS thesis can be done on any security-related topic.  Students may
design special topic courses and study with the approval of a faculty
member.

PhD work in computer security is possible -- all three of the major
faculty listed above would be interested in good students developing
security-related theses.

Information on the grad program can be obtained by sending e-mail to
wjg@cs.purdue.edu

[Ed. Thanks for the update, Gene!  I've added this information to the

'lo there

I've read the recent message discussing the possiblity of a virus
causing multiple copies of a WordPerfect within itself.  I've seen this
many times here at CUA.  In all of the cases that I've seen, it was do
to operator error.

     It appears that people often retreive their document into itself
(for example after printing).  If a document begins or ends with more
than a screenful of blank lines, it looks like it is empty.  Users
then retreive their document and answer "yes" to the question
"Retreive into current document?"

     Repeating this will naturally create LARGE files!  :-)

Subject: re: *NIX virus... necessary knowledge. (UNIX)

Jan C. Zawadzki <S72UZAW@TOE.TOWSON.EDU> writes that a virus under
"*nix" must be "capable of switching from regular to priviledged
mode and back without the knowledge of the os.".  I don't think that's
correct.   All a virus has to do is:

  - Get (generally from the operating system) a list of files to which it
    can write; choose one or more executables from that list.
  - Read each one to see whether or not it is already infected.
  - If not, do appropriate reads and writes to the file to
    infect it (add a copy of the virus to it, at the start of
    the execution path).

None of these things requires any sort of special privilege.  Of
course, such a simple "well-behaved" virus won't be able to infect any
files to which the os doesn't give it write access, but THAT'S OK!
Fred Cohen's experiments show that there's enough program-sharing and
enough writeable executables in at least some *nix environments that a
virus can spread very widely very quickly without subverting the os in
any way.

The "viruses need to write directly to the hardare" or "viruses need
to modify the operating system" or "viruses need to subvert
operating-system security" or "viruses need to have special
privileges" stories are all common, and all false*.

* (with the possible exception of some operating systems in which
writing to any executable requires a special privilege; such systems
are quite rare in real life, I think.)

Subject: re: MS/Dos vs. different viruses (PC)

DRAGON@RCN.BITNET (MYSTENSERTABETHIEN AND COMPANY) asks about how
effective FORMATing a disk or erasing a file is in removing a virus.
For most file-infecting viruses, it's sufficient to (1) get the virus
out of memory, by power-off-rebooting from an uninfected diskette, and
(2) erase all the infected files on all media (this includes backup
sets, diskettes in drawers, that diskette you loaned to the guy in the
next room the other day that he's about to return, etc).  For viruses
that infect diskette boot sectors, I'd generally recommend doing (1)
above, using COPY (not DISKCOPY) to stash away any important files on
the diskette, and then FORMATting the diskette (FORMAT on a diskette
actually removes all the data).

Boot-infecting viruses on hard disks are somewhat more complex.  The
DOS command "FORMAT" only does things to the DOS partition.  If a
virus (like the Stoned) has infected the master boot record, which is
outside the DOS partition, FORMAT won't touch it.  Removal techniques
for such viruses include a low-level format of the entire drive
(ouch), virus-specific removal programs, and utility programs that
re-write the master boot record.  Other viruses (like the Bouncing
Ball) infect the DOS boot record, which _is_ in the DOS partition, and
these can generally be removed with a FORMAT, or even just with the
SYS command.  Of course, always scan your system after a clean boot
one last time, to make sure the virus is really gone (and don't forget
all those diskettes).

"Stealth" viruses are not much harder to clean up from than normal
viruses; you just have to be a little more careful.  As long as you
haven't run an infected program, or booted from an infected
disk(ette), a file/disk infected with a "stealth" virus is just as
easy to find as any other infected thing.  A "stealth" virus can do
confusing things to you only if it gets a chance to run, after all!

From:    David J Ferbrache <davidf@cs.hw.ac.uk>
Subject: Re: UNIX virus... necessary knowledge (UNIX)

In reply to Jan Zawadzki's note on necessary knowledge for a UNIX
virus writer I would like to make a few comments.

Firstly, UNIX viruses have been reported dating back to Fred Cohen's
early work in November 1983. This virus was reported (in Cohen's paper
on Computer viruses: theory and experiments) as taking 8 hours to
write, infecting in 5 seconds and consisting of 200 lines of C code.

A number of other UNIX viruses have been reported to me in private
communications dating back to 1987.

While UNIX does provide an environment with hardware (and kernel)
support for memory management and process segregation, it does not
provide a sufficiently strict security model to prevent viral code
propagation. Specifically the discretionary access controls (DACs)
incorporated into standard UNIX are specified at the option of the
user, and include the concept of a process run by the user inheriting
his full privileges (excluding the setuid,setgid concept for the
moment).

Thus a virus need only be embedded within a useful utility program
uploaded to a public area to achieve rapid spread throughout the UNIX
filesystem. In Cohen's case the "vd" utility was infected and then
uploaded to a public system area. A number of system administrators
then decided to "try" the program, at which point the virus inherited
the full permissions of the administrator and could infect any files
within the system, irrespective of DAC permissions set by the owner
(root users on UNIX bypass all file system protection attributes).

A virus can also gain full system privileges through incremental
penetration of the privilege levels. Specifically a "root"
(privileged) user who runs a program under a lower privilege usercode
(using substitute user "su"), will then infect all files in the
directory of the low privilege usercode. If at some future time he is
again in this directory, he may invoke an infected program
accidentally with full root privileges. Thus a virus can incrementally
penetrate security of DAC UNIX.

It is also worth noting that a significant number of documented
security loopholes exist within versions of UNIX. In a number of
installations these holes may not be patched, and if exploited may
provide a rapid channel for the acquisition of root privileges.
(examples are the fingerd and sendmail bugs "features?" in the 4.3 BSD
unix exploited by the Internet worm).

With regard to higher security systems certified under the NCSC TCSEC
criteria, virus propagation is not inhibited (again as indicated by
Cohen) under the Bell LaPadula model which is the basis of the TCSEC
mandatory access control (MAC) model. Thus a virus if run by a low
clearance user may propagate to executable files at the top secret and
strictest compartmentalisation. Indeed under MAC-only security models,
virus propagation may be potentially more rapid. The model will
however inhibit virus propagation to lower security levels. Thus a
virus in a "CONFIDENTIAL" program will never infect a "UNCLASSIFIED"
program but will infect a "TOP SECRET" program. The Biba extensions to
the Bell LaPadula model specifically address the concept of
hierarchies of program integrities, and would inhibit virus
propagation to high integrity (critical) executables.

Additional attacks are based on the "Trojan mule" attack of emulating
a login session which is not addressed until level B-2 and B-3 in the
TCSEC, with a view to acquiring valid user names and passwords; and on
the exploitation of incorrect permissions on special files (such as
the physical and kernel memory image files /dev/mem and /dev/kmem).

Once a virus is active DACs will not inhibit the comprimise of data.
Within the TCSEC MAC structure viruses can comprimise data by covert
channel techniques at a rate of 0.1 bit per second without being
subject to auditing at class B-2 for storage channels, and termination
at class B-3.

Just a few scriblings, basically UNIX viruses are not impossible, and
with careless users or administrators will spread rapidly. The
distributed trust features in the Berkeley "r" protocols will even
permit rapid spread across local area networks using distributed trust
(Cliff Stoll's ivy on a great oak tree).

In summary therefore:

1. Viruses in UNIX are possible
2. Viruses embedded in useful utilities will propagate rapidly under DACs
3. Viruses will propagate to higher security levels and stricter compartments
   under Bell LaPadula MACs
4. A number of known bugs in UNIX permit rapid acquisition of root privilege
5. Viruses may freely comprimise data in DAC systems (class C1,C2) by overt
   channels
6. Viruses may freely comprimise data in MAC systems (class B1) by covert
   channels

Please don't assume that because the hardware and OS kernel support a limited
virtual machine with memory and process segregation that virus spread is
impossible. It isn't. It just requires a little more time!

Subject: Music-Bug Update (PC)

	Recently, I received several infected disks in what appear to
be the original un-opened sealed envelopes. Examination showed that
the seals, while similar to those on the "Modular Component
Technologies" disk that contained the STONED virus, are different.
First, the envelopes have square flaps rather than the triangular one
used on the MCT disk. Second, the "floppy disk" seal uses a thinner
font and a different typeface than the MCT. Finally, the red square
overlay is centered on the seal and has different (chinese ?)
characters. The seals bear the (sequence ?) numbers 01206 and 01081.

	As mentioned, SCAN v71 does detect this virus [Muboot] on
these disks but CLEAN does not disinfect them. Floppies may be
disinfected by replacement of the boot sector though the other eight
sectors of the virus may have overlaid part of files on the disk. On
the samples provided, the virus stores the real boot sector followed
by seven viral code sectors on the disk with the CX and DX values
for Int 13 retrieval stored in offset 42h (DX) and 44h (CX) of the
disk boot sector.

	The original disks show no errors, but after infecting a floppy,
CHKDSK reported "4 lost clusters in 4 chains" where the 4096 bytes of
viral code appeared on the disk following pre-existing programs. Since the
real boot sector is stored here, use of the /F with CHKDSK followed by
deletion/overwrite of the "garbage" files would render a previously
bootable floppy disk unbootable.

	In limited testing on a hard disk (ST-412), the virus infects
the boot record (not the partition table) and after a cold boot from
a clean, protected floppy, the above method of recovery works. On the HD,
the "lost clusters" do not coincide with the viral code, instead files
in other areas may be corrupted/lost in multiple 4k (or larger) chunks.

	My concern is that since these disks were apparently distributed
along with Packard-Bell Computers and these computers are generally
sold by mass marketeers & department stores (I have seen about a
dozen ads in the last week) that the potential for a considerable
spread exists. I have no idea how many disks are involved.

	Incidently, regardless of the operating system involved,
these infected disks have the signature "IBM 3.3" in the infected
boot record and the first three bytes of the sector are "FA E9 CC".
No "stealth" is involved. An infected machine will have total memory
reduced by 4096 bytes (on 640k machine, CHKDSK will report 651264 bytes
instead of 655360).

	The following is a abbreviated directory listing of the
three infected distribution disks (2 in "SVA" envelope, 1 in
"COMBASE" envelope - note: id is by disk label, there are no markings
on the envelopes other than the seal):
