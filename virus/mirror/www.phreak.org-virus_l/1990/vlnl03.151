VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,

The Salk vaccine was a _KILLED_ virus vaccine, created by Jonas Salk.
Several years later, Albert Sabin created a weakened _LIVE_ virus
vaccine, called, not surprisingly, the Sabin vaccine.  Its purpose was
not to spread to "non-vaccinated" people.  It was designed neither to
spread not to make people sick; just to do a better job of getting the
immune system to create antibodies to polio than did the Salk vaccine.
Being a killed virus, and barring an error in the creation of the
killed virus vaccine, the Salk vaccine could neither spread nor make
anyone sick.  (With both vaccines, and indeed with almost any vaccine,
it is possible that the manufacture of the vaccine might be defective,
leaving live unweakened virus.  _VERY UNLIKELY_.  It is further
possible, and more likely but still unlikely, that any particular
person can have an allergic reaction to a vaccine, and get sick,
sometimes very sick.)

No, I am sorry, it could not.  It could be written not to infect
certain known operating systems, but it could not be written to
"infect only certain" ones.  The susceptibility of unknown systems
cannot be known.

The distinction is an important one.  It points out another flaw in
the hypothesis of the "benign" virus.  That is, a benign virus must
not only be implemented perfectly, but it requires perfect knowledge.
It not only requires perfect knowledge about the machine in which it
is intended to execute, it requires perfect knowledge about all of the
machines in which it may execute.  Such knowledge would strain the
deity.

While the virus creator can know how his creation will behave in a
given execution environment, he cannot possibly know how it will
behave in a population.  Good intentions and competence are not
enough.  He who sets out to write a benign virus is guilty of
unconscionable and reckless hubris.  Such hubris is mitigated by the
ignorance and immaturity that often accompany it.  We cannot do
anything about the immaturity, but let us disabuse one and all of the
ignorance.

When you try to boot your machine and get the infamous "1701" code, in
IBM PC lingo this means trouble. The 1701 error code means physical
damage to hard drive sector zero.  In other words, it's time to
replace the hard drive.  The fact that you can't access your hard
drive, even when booting from a clean floppy (if it's damaged, it will
be inaccessible-- one of the first things the system does when it
boots is perform an I/O check on your drives), and that SCAN hasn't
found anything suggests to me that it's NOT a virus.

Subject: SLOW virus (PC)

During the past 3 weeks, I have had to disinfect a number of sites
here in Australia (Oz) that were infected with the SLOW virus.
Disinfection has just been a matter of wiping the infected .com and
.exe files.

For virus reference, I have vsum9008: this is the latest information I
have but this document has no detail on any damage that this virus can
inflict.  MacAfee's virlist lists it as O,P,L but that is all the
information I have.  Does anyone have any information as to what
triggers its destructive mechanism and how it accomplishes the damage?
Is there any more known about this virus?  I realise that infection
outside of Oz is rare but it is quite virulent here and any
information would be gratefully accepted.

It can be Polish, but I'm not sure. Anyway, this mean simply

A disassembled copy of the "Stoned" virus was just posted to the
comp.os.msdos.programmer newsgroup on Usenet.

The virus is wll known, and disinfection programs are readily
available, but the worrying part is that somebody might take the code
and rewrite it a bit, so the virus would not be detectable by the
virus scanners out there.

A rather irresponsible act, in my opinion.

Subject: Periodic virus sighting report

The following new, or otherwise important, virus infections were
reported recently:

- - 4096 (PC) reported in Philadelphia, PA, and Australia.

- - Marijuana (PC) reported in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.

- - Jerusalem B (PC) reported to be inadvertantly distributed on some
  animation programs sold at flea markets.  Note that these infections
  do NOT necessarily mean that anyone should boycott flea market
  software.  They only serve to illustrate that it is always advisable
  to scan (using your favorite UP-TO-DATE virus scanner) ALL newly
  purchased software.

These sightings were reported to me; they are in addition to the other
reports that have appeared on VALERT-L and/or VIRUS-L.  When possible,
I have phoned at least one contact in the area to verify the
sightings.

Subject: Non-Virus in Shadow Ram (PC)

	Last night I started receiving alarming messages form my home
PC. Messages like "CANNOT LOAD COMMAND.COM" & "GENERAL FAILURE ERROR"
(on the hard drive) plus boot failures and CMOS trashing. The odd
thing was that if I booted from floppy everything was fine & Norton
reported everything allright.

	Applying Occam's Razor, I removed the LOADHI.SYS from the 10k
trackball driver just added the day before and let it load low. Having
noted some erratic behaviour from things loaded into high memory
before (applications failing strangely, odd display action), this was
my first thought.

	Apparently my high memory manager (QEMM 5.0) has some problems
deciding what high memory is actually unused. In this case, I suspect
that the T'ball driver's buffer was overlaying part of the hard disk
controller (In shadow ram & evidently mutable). But then, if my high
memory were not already overloaded with video, Bernoulli, anti-virus,
print, disk-cache, and keyboard utilities already, I would not have a
problem. Now if I can just figure out DesqView...

	Meanwhile, I have not had time to make a detailed analysis of
just what happened but have noticed a few threads mentioning the same
sort of behaviour & suspect that since my machine has an AMI BIOS with
C&T chipset, it is probably the rule rather than the exception.

	Two factors stand out: the potential for accidental misuse of
high memory could have drastic consequences (consider such an
happening during DEFRAG operations) & for an "at risk" machine, the
performance gain from shadowing must be weighed against the potential
for malicious damage.

	Of course if the vendors would just get their act together &
produce machine speed BIOS (wiring, NOT the fact that it is in ROM)
like they have in upscale video cards the answer would be simple -
except we probably would not pay for it. Oh, Well.

"Sudah ada vaksin" is an Indonesian language which is mean "There is a
vaccine".  And I believe that Mardi Bros virus is made by Indonesian,
I have a small article about it in Indonesia Computer magazine.  I
don't have it on hand, but it looks like a modification of DenZuk
which is made by Indonesian also.

Iain Noble asked in yesterday's VIRUS-L if there existed a Joshi virus

McAfee's M-DISK.  Both programs remove the Joshi and repair the
