Scanres is distributed by McAfee Associates.  If you would like to talk
to them about your problem, their voice line is (408) 988-3832.  If you
would like to get the newest version of their program, call THE HOME BASE
BBS, which is McAfee's own board, at (408) 988-4004.  I have version
5.2 which was released on 12-31-89, so its pretty recent.

As far as I can tell from the documentation, which comes with the program,
there is no way to remove it from memory.  Of course if you have a TSR
management system, or even something like MARK and CLEAR, that wouldn't
be very tough.  (How that works is you run MARK before you invoke a TSR,
and then CLEAR to take the TSR out of memory.  Both are available on any
good BBS.)  I got a copy of SCANRES in for evaluation, but have decided
not to use the product, because I just am NOT scared of this whole virus
craze.  I am a smart, careful user, and I believe that smart users will
probably never be hit.  Unfortunately I have a campus full of less smart
users that have been hit on occassion.  We are using SAM for the Macs, and
have decided that at this time we don't need anything on the PCs.

Oh, you might point out to your boss that SCANRES is only using 17K of RAM
and it probably is not worth his time to try and get that 17K, unless you
just really are TIGHT on RAM.  (You could use MAPMEM to show him that
figure, which is also available on most good BBS systems.)

Subject: re: LZEXE and SCAN (PC)

McAfee also has a solution for this problem.  SHEZ, which is a
compressed file manager, will work in cooperation with SCAN from
McAfee to scan compressed files for viruses.  If I understand its
functioning correctly what actually occurs is that it searches the
compressed file for .EXE, .COM, .OBJ, and .SYS files, then
uncompresses them into a temporary file and scans that temp file.  I
am not sure on that.  SCAN and SHEZ are both available at the HOME
BASE BBS (408) 988-4004.

Remember, if you are going to use SHareware regularly, you are
obligated to REGISTER it.  Go ahead and d/l the programs, try them
out, and see if you have a use for them.  If you do: REGISTER THEM!!

In Craigs' note of Fri 18, May, he writes:

	It is important that the following distinction be made:
		1- he had the virus only on his test machine.
		2- for some reason, one of his co-workers shipped
		   a file around that was infected.

	The distinction here, is that he didn't set it loose inside of AT&T,
	but only on HIS test machine...  Because of unfortunate events, it
	got loose.

	In either case, he also did the presentation for Decus

"The wily hacker turned out to be 26-year-old Marcus Hess of Hanover,

Clifford Stoll spoke at Compcon 90, thus the above reference.  Has
the press been particularly quite about this?  Morris got lots of
press for a hack, but Hess stole time, services and information.

Hey, what's up? I thought it was an established convention to speak of

We haven't seen Brain for a long time, now any of the Icelandic

both Vacsina and Dark Avenger (1st version). Stoned was distributed
along with a video card by a major realsaler in Germany and they
didn't do a great job at cleaning up after themselves. We are getting
quite a few reports of viruses we have never heard about, reported by
obscure antiviruses. Until we see the disks we wont know what they
really have.

Subject: Compressed Files and Virus Scanning (PC)

	This is a forward from John McAfee:
===================================================================

	Rich Garzon's posting, (V3 #96) about the dangers of LZEXE
compressed files, mirrors the real and growing problem with people
planting viruses inside such self-extracting executables.  LZEXE
has become extremely popular and is readily available to anyone
wishing to hide a known virus and distribute it.  Nearly all EXE
files can be compressed with LZEXE and one need only infect a given
file with a common virus, LZEXE it, and the end result is a
functioning program carrying a non-detectable virus.  The average
user cannot distinguish a compressed executable from a non-
compressed version in most cases.
	In addition to purposefully planting viruses inside LZEXE'd
files, many cases have surfaced where end users have inadvertently
compressed already infected files for their own use.  These files
have then been passed around to friends and co-workers.
	After a virus begins to spread from one of these self-
extracting executables it can readily be identified.  But the
problem, of course, is that the disinfection process usually skips
over the compressed carrier program -- since it can't be identified
with normal scanning techniques -- and the virus begins spreading
all over again.
	The issue is further complicated by the fact that LZEXE
compressed files may carry an external infection as well as an
internal infection.  What this means is that a virus inside such
a file may re-infect the compressed executable as if it were a
normal EXE file.  The virus fails to detect that it has already
infected the program (internally).  This external infection may be
cleaned using a disinfector and yet the file will still be
infectious.  This adds confusion to the end user who is trying to
deal with an infection.
	All in all this is becoming a serious problem.  Numerous
shareware and commercial packages (SHEZ, CHECKOUT, etc.) have been
developed as companion programs to allow VIRUSCAN to scan inside
ZIP, ARC, LZH, ZOO, PAK and other non-self extracting archive
files.  Even without special utilities, the non-self extracting
archives do not represent a serious problem because the user may
simply UNZIP (or UNARC etc.) the archive and then scan the contents
prior to execution.  But no-one has yet addressed the LZEXE
problem.
	Since we are not compression specialists, we were hoping for
someone competent in the field to develop another SCAN companion
program, like SHEZ, to do the internal scanning.  This has not
happened.  Therefore, version 63 of SCAN, to be released June 1,
will contain its own internal scan capability for LZEXE compressed
files.  It automatically identifies LZEXE compressed files and
scans inside them.  The program works fine and successfully
identifies all the known viruses inside such files, but it probably
is not as fast as it could have been if it had been developed by
hands more experienced in compression/decompression algorithms.
Nevertheless, it's all that we have for now and it works.  If you
have only a few LZEXE compressed files in your system, you probably
will not notice a significant slowdown in the scanning process.
If you have no such files, the scan time will be the same as
before.  If ALL of your files are LZEXE'd, then I'd suggest you go
out for coffee and donuts during the scan, or possibly take a brief
nap, catch up on your paperwork or do a few calisthenics -- you'll
have plenty of time.  We have included a switch, by the way, to
turn off the internal LZEXE scan if you choose.

Subject: New MDEF Virus & Disinfectant 1.8 (Mac)

Disinfectant 1.8
================

May 20, 1990

Disinfectant 1.8 is a new release of our free Macintosh virus
detection and repair utility.

Version 1.8 recognizes the new MDEF virus.  Thanks to Tom Young for
reporting this new virus and sending us a copy.

The MDEF Virus
==============

The MDEF virus was first discovered at Cornell University in May, 1990.
It is also sometimes called the "Garfield" virus.

MDEF infects both applications and the System file. It does not infect
document files. The Finder and DA Handler also usually become infected.
The System file is infected as soon as an infected application is run.
Other applications become infected as soon as they are run on an infected
system.

As with all of the other known Macintosh viruses, MDEF does not
intentionally attempt to do any damage, but it is harmful anyway.
It does not beep, display messages or pictures, or do anything other
than spread from file to file.

For technical reasons, the MDEF virus only spreads on some kinds of
Macintoshes. It causes the Mac 128K and the 512K to crash. It spreads
successfully on the 512KE, Plus, SE, SE/30, II, IIx, and IIcx. On the
Mac IIci and IIfx, it spreads from infected applications to uninfected
system files, but it does not spread from infected systems to uninfected
applications. We have not yet had the opportunity to test the virus on
the Mac Portable.

The MDEF virus has an unfortunate reaction with Vaccine. On
Vaccine-protected systems, if an infected application is run, Vaccine
properly notifies the user of the attack, but it blocks only part of the
attempt by the virus to infect the System file. The virus cannot spread
from the System file to applications in this situation, but the System
file is damaged, and menus no longer work properly. When you press on a
menu title in the menu bar, no menu pops down. Menus continue to work
properly only in infected applicationsthey do not work properly in the
Finder or in uninfected applications. Disinfectant will properly detect
and repair these kinds of damaged System files.

GateKeeper is totally effective against the MDEF virus. It successfully
blocks the attempt by the virus to infect the System file. The System file
is unchanged. Menus do not work properly in infected applications, but
they do work properly in the Finder and in uninfected applications. This
menu behavior is the exact opposite of what happens on Vaccine-protected
systems.

The MDEF virus is named after the type of resource it uses to infect files.
MDEF resources are a normal part of the Macintosh system, so you should not
become alarmed if you see them with ResEdit or some other tool.

The MDEF and WDEF viruses have similar names, but they are completely
different and should not be confused with each other.

Other Changes in Version 1.8
============================

A change was made in Disinfectant 1.7 which caused problems with GateKeeper
for a few people. The change made it necessary to grant Disinfectant 1.7
GateKeeper privileges even when just scanning for viruses. Previous
versions required privileges only when repairing infected files. This
problem has been fixed in version 1.8GateKeeper privileges are now once
again required only when repairing files.

We made a change to the way that auto-floppy scanning works. Disinfectant
first examines the internal floppy drive and the external floppy drive
(if you have one) to see if they both contain inserted disks. If they
both do, Disinfectant ejects one of them, then asks you to insert the
first floppy to be scanned. Disinfectant will no longer eject a CD-ROM
or any other kind of non-floppy removable disk in this situation.

How to Get a Copy of Version 1.8
================================

Disinfectant 1.8 is available now via anonymous FTP from site
acns.nwu.edu [129.105.49.1].  It will also be available soon on
sumex-aim, rascal, comp.binaries.mac, CompuServe, Genie, Delphi, BIX,
MacNet, America Online, Calvacom, AppleLink, and other popular sources
for free and shareware software.

Macinstosh users who do not have access to bulletin boards,
networks, user groups, or online services may obtain a copy of
Disinfectant by sending a self-addressed stamped envelope and an
800K floppy disk to the author at the address below.

WARNING!  WARNING!  WARNING!  WARNING!  WARNING!  WARNING!
- ----------------------------------------------------------

There is a file being circulated on BBS's called PKZ120.ZIP or
PKZ120.EXE or similar, and that claims to be version 1.20 of PKZIP but
in fact is a hacked version of PKZIP 1.10.

As of the date of this writing, the latest version of PKZIP is
version 1.10.  Furthermore, due to this intentional act of
vandalism, PKWARE will not release any versions of PKZIP in the
future with the version 1.20.

If you see the files PKZ120.ZIP or PKZ120.EXE on any BBS or
on-line system, please ask the SysOp of that system to remove
the files IMMEDIATELY, and please contact PKWARE to report
where the files were seen.

REWARD!
- -------

PKWARE is offering a reward of lifetime free upgrades for PKZIP
to anyone who can provide information leading to the
identification and prosecution of the person or persons
responsible for creating this bogus version 1.20 of the
software.  They have only served to confuse and hurt the user
community, and the perpetrators of this crime are at minimum in
violation of Federal Copyright Law.

If you have any information about the source of PKZ120.EXE or
PKZ120.ZIP, please report it to PKWARE immediately, either:

by Voice at 414-352-3670

I have seen no other confirmation of this, but the latest PKZIP is
version 1.10 as far as I can determine.
