VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Abstract:
- ---------

This note describes the MD4 message digest algorithm.  The algorithm
takes as input an input message of arbitrary length and produces as
output a 128-bit ``fingerprint'' or ``message digest'' of the input.
It is conjectured that it is computationally infeasible to produce two
messages having the same message digest, or to produce any message
having a given prespecified target message digest.  The MD4 algorithm
is thus ideal for digital signature applications, where a large file
must be ``compressed'' in a secure manner before being signed with the
RSA public-key cryptosystem.

The MD4 algorithm is designed to be quite fast on 32-bit machines.
On a SUN Sparc station, it runs at 1,066,000 bytes/second.  On a DEC
MicroVax II, it runs at 70,000 bytes/second.  In addition, the MD4
algorithm does not require any large substitution tables; the
algorithm can be coded quite compactly.

  Well, there IS in fact a software lock on Mac floppies, but it is
not the one I referred to. This "is it hard or soft" issue was
answered definitively (well, good enough for me...) by someone at
apple.com who said that the interlock for the write protect tabs is in
fact hardware based. This is the way it should be, of course, but I'm
happy Apple did it right way back in 1984 because thats were my Mac
originated!
  So, if the tab is set to lock, don't worry about anything malicious,
unless someone before you was eating a particularly messy sandwich
that might leave, for example, jelly in your drive. Other than that,
your safe.

Subject: Better name for the "VCOMM" (reply to frisk)

Oh, is *that* where the name came from?   We could certainly use
a better one.   "Polish", or even "Polish EXE", is likely to
be confusing before too long (more than one virus may come from
that area).   How about using the virus length (or the minimum
number of bytes it will add to an EXE file)?   I think that's a
decent nomenclature, especially for these viruses that are,
and are likely to remain, very rare...         DC

Subject: Need info on worms & net security

Hello..
I need your help. I am trying to write a paper on Security on Computer
Networks. I would like to know more about Worms, incidents about Worms
and main security leakages in Networks. Also I want to know how
security is established in different nets (BITNET, ARPA Internet, NetNorth,
etc..) Any help would be GREATLY appreciated. I would more appreciate it
if it will be quick.. You can write to my own account ESRA@TREARN..

Many thanks in advance..

I'm not familiar with the Amiga, but it is known that some programs
that directly program the video hardware do so incorrectly, leaving
the video signal in an "undefined" or "marginal" state.  This could
cause problems of the sort that you describe (by the way, this could
also lead to permanent damage of the monitor).

Subject: re: Viruses using Hamming (PC)

I'm not entirely sure why anyone should be worried by the fact that
some viruses are using error-correcting codes; to my knowledge, none
of the Bulgarian viruses use them for anything very interesting, at
least from the point of view of protection.  Perhaps I've missed
something key: does the use of Hamming codes by these viruses somehow
make them harder to detect, remove, or otherwise protect oneself
against?  DC

Subject: Tying SCAN and CLEAN together (PC)

I have an idea that may or may not be taken into consideration. I was
wondering if one could SCAN and if present, CLEAN a virus in the same
batch file. It is not possible unless you CLEAN all known viruses
(that takes a little time :-)).

It occurred to me that if SCAN returned ERRORLEVEL codes when
completed (a different ERRORLEVEL code for each virus) then through a
batch file any known viruses could removed. The batch file would only
contain known viruses in the area.

It would really be helpful and I'm sure many would appreciate this
feature if implemented. Of course, it's only a thought.  I was also
wondering if an ERRORLEVEL code could be included that handles disks
that are not in the drive to be scanned. These, of course, are only
suggestions.

Thanks for ypour time.

When was this announced? I only just heard of it a few days ago.  Had
I known of such an event much earlier, I may have been able to go, but
this way.....

Perhaps someone (Ken?) could summerize what was said and post it in
this forum.

[Ed. The workshop was announced at least a week or so ago here on
VIRUS-L.  I'm only attending for one (of two) day, but I'll send in a
summary of day one.  Anyone want to summarize day two?]

       I am confused.  I really want to help.  I will report any

Why not create a second list, comp.virus.reports (and something like
vrepor-l for bitnet users) so that those who want to monitor/report
virus spread can do so, and others can chose not to read it?
