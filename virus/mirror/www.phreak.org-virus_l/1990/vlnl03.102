I am a consultant working in a lab at Michigan State University.  I've
seen my share of viruses come through the labs.  I just wanted to say
that I've found the Stoned virus on our campus.  I can't post directly
to VALERT-L so I wanted to send this to you.  Stoned is definitely
alive and kicking.

Subject: Virii (mock-swedish)

The nice thing about a small group of people is that we can decide our
own conventions. Personally, I prefer virii for several reasons:

1) Viri is already taken (vir)
2) Virae is possible but equally incorrect.
3) American English will adopt anything.
4) Virii is distinctive, understood by most researchers, and much easier
   than viruses for a two-finger typist.
5) Virii, when spoken, readily lends itself to an intonation a la Yogi Bear.

Subject: WDEF info needed

Recent posts tell me that a WDEF virus was discussed exhaustively in
this newsgroup some time ago. I wouldn't want to start another deluge
on the topic, but could someone possibly email me a synopsis of the
posts, or just a short description on what kinds of problems this
virus caused?

A friend of mine purchased a MAC se-30 about 9 months ago. Last week
she could not access her hard drive.  She took the system in for
repair, the repair folks said the drive "was really messed up" and
replaced it for $600.

She got the system back, started to load up the hard drive, added Sum2
sofware and immediately got a virus alert. The only applications other
that MAC standard code that came with the system was McWorks, Word
Perfect, a game called Math Rabbit, and a childrens publisher called
"Once Upon a Time". All software was bought from the dealer or Egghead
Software.

She bought SAM software and found the WDEF virus has infected half of
your disks.

Could it be possible that the virus caused the problem with the drive
mentioned above? If so what could it have done?

Networks can be infected, too, which would be regarded as a major
security risk by most admins. The current children playing with
forgeries in news.admin shows this, as well as the difficulty of
tracking down persons causing problems.

Or downloading an infected piece of software from somewhere.
I suppose someone could figure out how to infect a file being
passed through a system, once it becomes a common, standardized
practice.

Assuming the company wants to maintain a full library of games on
their mainframe or server. In one division of this company, the
senior VP put out an edict that anyone who was caught with a game
program on their system would be fired. I don't think they'll
provide them on a server, either. I also wouldn't want a customer
directly accessing a mainframe/server either, for security
reasons. They might upload something infected....

As a security matter, the ultimate master and the machine it resides
on should be checked daily, or at least prior to any duplication
run. It should certainly not be used for anything else, including
playing games.

If commercially distributed, shrink-wrap software were a MAJOR channel
of infection, this would be the case. While some viri reportedly do
get into them, I think 75-80% get spread via user's floppies, and
not just games. Most of the remainder (as far as I've seen, anyway)
get distributed to individual machines on networks, as a result of
one user running an infected program (or uploading one) while logged
on. I suspect distributed software is only a couple of percent
of infection cases.

If removable media is used, it's the package on the fifth aisle, etc.
because you shouldn't be copying the software off another machine to
begin with.

Incidentally, a similar scheme has been tried some years ago. I don't
think you realize the magnitude of distribution you're talking about;
there's hundreds of companies out there, with thousands of products,
virtually none of which are compatible with each other beyond some
low level hardware protocols. All of them will want their way, none
will want competitors to have access (i.e., security will be a
nightmare--this isn't public domain or shareware we're talking about)
and what happens when the system has a hard crash must also be
considered.

I think that on a small scale, this is already being done on networks
using a central server. In that case, an admin is responsible for
making certain that only clean software gets loaded, as well as
educating the users in proper security and operating proceedures.

As a means of commercially distributing software, it's not feasible
yet, and may never be. Think about some of the lost, misrouted, and
garbled articles you see on usenet. Would you want to try and send
a 6MB software package thru with that risk? Would you blithly trust
your (companies') system to such a package, without checking it?
If you have to check it, you might as well have shrink-wrap to open.

Subject: "The Kinetics of Computer Virus Replication" by Dr. Peter Tippett

	Having had the opportunity to review this paper (22 pages), I
find it on one hand a very complex analysis, and on the other, an
overly simplistic approach to the situation.

	As some confusion concerning the definition of "virus" and "worm"
(a worm can certainly have a trigger event), and the speed of PCs
(a 12 Mhz machine is not a 12 MIPS machine) indicate, the paper
is based on a few flawed assumptions.

	The most basic is that of Assumption #4 "The replication and
infection ... is essentially a binary process" (page 3) and the basis
of Equation #1 "...(infected) computers have more or less equal chance(s)
of causing infection of another...". Since the extrapolated rate of
increase of infections leads from this assumption, I cannot accept the
rest of the math though he does make some valid points. The simple
fact is that NOT all computers are equally likely to infect others.
Certainly, my office unit is far less likely to infect another than
that at HOMEBASE should it become infected. (Of course mine is somewhat
more likely to become infected).

	I would suggest that at least three separate classes of
computers is required: Source nodes (manufacturers and software developers),
Transit nodes (bulletin boards, "open" educational and corporate PCs),
and End nodes (most home and corporate units). The first two classes,
while able to widely spread infections through networks and modem
connections, are in the minority: 10% or 5,000,000 PCs (WAG). End nodes,
while they may exhibit some binary characteristics, would do so within
a relatively small domain ( <100 PCs).

	Additionally, viral dynamics would have to consider at least two
stages: slow leaps between nodes via type 1 or type 2 systems, and rapid
spread within an end node (type 3) which may follow a binary
progression for a short time.

	Finally, once the characteristics are recognized, detection
time is reduced within nodes and most nodes, lead by type 1 and 2,
will develop some form of "immunity" to that strain. Thus the curve
most likely will have two "knees", one at discovery by the global-
expert community, and one at discovery by the local-user communities.

	Thus, while Dr. Tippett concludes that there will be an
explosive growth in virii (I like ii better), my feeling is that
while there probably will be growth, it will be containable, and
that appropriate levels of response will be dictated by the importance
and exposure of the systems.

Subject: Problems with McAfee's Clean 62. (Pc)

  Hi. We have a CopyWrite (Nov 88) infected with 1701/1704 virus
(.170x.)
  The McAfee's VShield and Scan detects the virus, and the Clean
says 'Virus Removed' when run. But if we Scan the disk again,
the virus has not been removed. (Vshield also detects it
if we run the CopyWrite).
  We do this in a IBM PS/2 model 50, and Zenith 286.

  We download the McAfee M1704ALL from Simtel and try to remove
the virus with this one, but It doesn't detect it.

  Ideas?

Is there any hard evidence for this? Does anyone know of *any*
infection spread from a BBS download? Or is this one of those virus
myths that sounds satisfying in a folk-lore sort of way without any
real basis in facts?

Where I live there are few BBS's (I access several.) and few virus types
(I'm responsible for keeping my department's computers clean.) and I'm
quite sure that the viruses I've seen did not come from the BBS's.

It seems to me most sysops are conscientious about checking the files
their users upload, and BBS users are among the most aware about virus
problems and their solutions.

A *primary* vector? I seriously doubt it.

Re: Berkley and Mr. McMahon's comments on Cuckoo's Egg

The Reader's Digest article in question appears in the April, 1990
edition.  It describes in detail Mr. Stoll's experience with the
German hackers up to the time of the latter's discovery and arrest.
The article is home, so much of this information is also off my
head.  Over the Memorial Day weekend, I will skim through it and
send further details.
Karl Koch was the hacker who allegedly committed suicide after Marcus
Hess was discovered.  I am not sure if he was the contact between the
hackers and the KGB, which did pay the hackers  (about $50,000, a
relative pittance in the spy world) for the data Hess stole from
Berkley.  Many hackers see Koch as a hero who was murdered by the
establishment for his involvement in the "Cuckoo's Egg" incidents.
For those who happen to read the Reader's Digest article (please do
not interpret this as flaming, I just think it ought to be mentioned
now to preclude any flames), one may gain the impression that the
Computer Chaos Club, to which the German hackers belonged, was
responsible for the break-in at the California databases.  There is
a counterculture within the CCC that believe that databases are made
to be broken into and viruses are the way to protest the invasion of
privacy that they perceive computer databases do.  The CCC itself is
concerned with developing and promoting computer and network
applications in German-speaking Europe and does not endorse database
tampering by unauthorized personnel.

Subject:      Bogus SCAN.EXE

A file called SCAN.ZIP has been uploaded to one of the BBSs here,
in Israel. I noticed that the file was very small (about 7K of ZIP)
and the description said that it can detect 103 viruses. I, ofcourse,
downloaded this file and checked it right away. This program seems
to be identical to SCAN.EXE from first look except for two things:
1. The bogus SCAN was not written in C - it's write_to_screen routine
is much faster than the real SCAN's one. 2. The screen is cleared
before the bogus SCAN.EXE activates itself. The bogus SCAN size is
28720 bytes long - much smaller than the original one. The version of
this bogus SCAN is 9.4V65. When you execute SCAN C: for instance, it
seems to work fine - It scanns the memory (much faster than usual,
tough - false check) and starts checking the files (also, much faster).
The reason for the quick files scan is that the files are actually
being replaced with a 14 bytes text file which contains the message:
"Next time...". Note that this file came as a stand alone file without
all the documentations and validation program. Also note that all
the messages from the real SCAN has been copied to the bogus SCAN. Just
from looking at the messages, you can't tell if it's a real SCAN or a
bogus one (you can always check the version number, though).

I do not think that this file will not leave Israel but I would like
to warn everyone, anyway.
