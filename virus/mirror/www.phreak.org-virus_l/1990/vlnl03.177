VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Ross has "hit the nail on the head" as far as I'm concerned.  I work
in User Services at a college.  We have only 3.5 FTE employees in our
Academic Computing Services group.  Although I personally have not
been hit, some of our Mac users were before we had the necessary
information to make protection widely available.  In addition to Macs,
we support MS-DOS machines and a VAXcluster.  The proliferation of
viruses means that we must spend valuable time upgrading our
preparedness, which deprives our users of consulting support time.
Presumably, every college and university is having staff time go down
the drain in the same way.

The one "silver lining" to this is "the VIRUS-L community."  Thank
you, Ken, for all the time you spend so that the rest of us can obtain
the necessary resources quickly.  Thank you, all of you who have
written detection and removal programs and made them available at
little or no cost, so that colleges can afford them!

NO, the hidden subdirectories called DELETED are NOT virus or trojan!
They are simply an action of a program by Microsoft, called RM.EXE.
You see, the Microsoft Editor brags being able to bring back old
edits, and the only way to do that is to SAVE them.  It creates the
DELETED subdirectory and stores the files in there.

As for the 'e5' filenames, never heard of it.

ALSO, the SCANv68 is A TROJAN!!!

Novell/NetWare.

I found your story interesting, but confusing.  First you seem to say
they didn't pay you, then you seem to say they did.  If you work for
them, they might consider your news release to be "company confidential".

Is Novell part of NetWare?

What about the disk drive? Remember, the disk drive in a C64 is an
autonomous, programmable unit that could easily hide a virus. Such a
thing could spread to every executable program without much trouble,
unfortunately. Worse, the 64's disk drives are so slow that people
might not notice the extra delay... :^)

About the `deleted' directories, I once used one of MicroSoft editors
called `m' (I think it was with a FORTRAN compiler), which did exactly
that: create *hidden* directories with name `deleted' to store the
older versions of your files.  Of course, there were several tools
(don't remember the names) that allowed you to list, restore, and
delete these backups.

For a better diagnosis, you should try to pinpoint the exact behavior
of the `virus': remove all `deleted' directories, and check for their
appearance between every application you run.  Then list the content
of the dirctory, look at the files, and try to find out how they are
related to what you were doing (or to anything else in your
system...).

The same goes for the second `virus'.  Which files get deleted, when
do they get deleted, etc.

Of course, you *have* a complete backup of your data files.

Subject: Removing Joshi virus (PC)

Using a small signature (EB1F) for detecting the Joshi virus (or any
other virus) is not recommended. A future system or virus may have the
same signature and the results would be unpredictable.

Subject: novell question (PC)

I had a report from someone who has been having trouble with a small
Novell 286 network.  While the problems don't sound to me like any
known executable file virus, perhaps someone has seen similar
symptoms.

The server is not dedicated.  There have been a few file size changes,
to COMMAND.COM, and other files, on the order of 3K in size.  This is
on server files, not workstation files.  Once a message was printed
"The world will hear from me again".  The latest copy of McAfee's Scan
shows nothing, and any copies of the "infected" files do not appear to
have a virus infection after examination by experienced virus people.

Entire directories (Public) and individual programs including the
backup program have been wiped out several times.  User logins have
disappeared.  There may have been unusual .BAT files appearing and
disappearing.  The server has been downed several times.

If anyone has seen any symptoms similar to this recently, please let
me know.

        To all Vax-users,                               October 31, 1990


        I am currently a graduate student at Southeastern Massachusetts
        University and will be starting my Research Thesis in January
        1991.  My proposed interest is to develop a virus scanning program
        for the VMS operating system.

        I am writing this letter for assistance in obtaining information
        in relation to VMS operating system viruses.  If anyone has any
        knowledge of any such viruses, could you please send me all
        possible information in regards to them.

        Please send any informtion directly to the following BITnet
        address:

                IN::"PCIS14ST@SEMASSU.BITNET"


                                        Thanks in advance,

Subject: News from Bulgaria (PC)

I just received a package of the latest collection of Bulgarian viruses
from Vesselin Bontchev.  Some of the viruses were previously known, but
quite a few are new.

It included the following viruses:

	1024 (2 variants)
	1226
	2100
	Amstrad-852
	Anthrax
	Anti-Pascal (5 variants)
	Dir
	Evil
	Kamikazi
	MG
	Proud
	Tiny family (10 variants)
	Trackswap
	VFSI

So, as you can see, the Bulgarians are still quite active - the total of
Bulgarian virus variants is now well over 100.

Some notes:

	The Bulgarian "Tiny Family" is not related to the Danish "Tiny"
	virus at all.  The Bulgarians may have seen that virus as a
	challenge to write an even smaller virus, which they did - the
	smallest virus is 134 byte long.

	Evil, Proud, 1226 and Phoenix were all made available in three
	different ways:

	A standard infected .COM file,
	A "-M" file.
	A "-D" file.

	This should not be interpreted as if there are three different
	variants of each virus.  The "-M" file is just a sample .COM file
	infected with multiple copies of the virus, as it is occasionally
	unable to recognize existing infections.

	The "-D" file is just a memory dump of an infected .COM file,
	created by Vesselin Bontchev, after the virus has decrypted itself
	in memory.  This file will replicate as well, as the virus contains
	code to check if it is already encrypted or not.

Subject: WordPerfect and Jerusalem B virus (PC)

We have been infected with a Jerusalem B virus, and apparently have
gotten rid of it.  However, 5 minutes later, we get a phone call from
a network user (always the same) having problems with Word Perfect
(lines doubling themselves and hiding the line under.  We checked
their hard disk, we checked the WP directory, I took down the network
and ran a check on all the partitions.  Nothing.  And then WordPerfect
starts acting up.  We can't figure out if now we are dealing with a
bug in WordPerfect or with a virus we can't detect.  Clearly WP.EXE
needs to be reinstalled once infected.  Is this true of *.FIL files?
Any suggestions?

Subject: Looking for a school

Regular readers of VIRUS-L/comp.virus probably know me as the author
of the F-PROT anti-virus package and as the technical editor of the
Virus Bulletin, but unlike most of my postings, this one is not
virus-related.

[Ed. Even though this is "not virus-related", I've asked Frisk to post
summaries of any suggestions that he gets to the list, since I believe
it could be of general interest to a number of readers.]

The university of Iceland only offers a BS degree in Computer Science,
and my plans to obtain a MS or a PhD degree have now been delayed for
several years...first because of my software business here in Iceland,
then because of me waiting for my wife to finish her study.

Right now, however, we are looking for a school which offers what we
are looking for - it must be very strong in the areas of computer
security and artificial intelligence (my major areas of interest), and
it must also offer a good MBA program (in particular including
'International Business') for her.

The last requirement is that the school must be in an English-speaking
country - preferably USA or the UK.

If the school is interested in getting a PC-virus specialist that
would help, of course :-)

So, if any of you VIRUS-L/comp.virus readers know of a school which
fits our requirements, I would be grateful for the information.
