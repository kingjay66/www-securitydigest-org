Agree that "Stealth" has become a class of virus.  However, I suggest
limiting it to those viruses that use the technique of disinfecting
their prey (either on disk or in memory).
 
Reason: Clarity.  A virus that "hides" by counter-attacking the virus
detection software (making it lie about infections) is not of the same
class as a disinfector.  Theoretically, it should always be possible
to use the "stealth" code to recover the infected programs.
 
I propose the following definition:
 
Stealth - (adj) Any malicious code that "hides" from detection by
erasing itself from its carrier.

Subject: Cost of Protection (Philosophy)

Earlier, Padgett Peterson comments seemed to imply that some people
resent having to pay McAfee for virus protection - despite SCAN's
relative inexpensiveness.  It's my impression that this resentment is
very real and much of it comes from the fact that users can get
relatively the samelevel of protection on their Macintoshes (ie.
Disinfectant and GateKeeper) FREE OF CHARGE.  Until Macintosh viruses
become as numerous and malicious as the PC viruses, I can't see this
attitude much in the near future.

Just a thought...

Subject: Possible virus? (PC)

Recently when I turned on my portable (AT compatable) computer, it was
giving BIOS error. Since I know a little about computer, I reformatted
the hard drive and installed dos. Now, machine is booting from
harddrive. Since, I am suspicious about viruses, I used "Scan" (by
McAfee) program but it could not detect any viruses in the memory.
Another program VACINE also could not detect any thing in IBMBIO.COM
and IBMDOS.COM. Then I used FLU_SHOT+ program (using FCP command). It
giving me the following messesages:
                 Bad Checksum on C:\COMMAND.COM
                 Actual Checksum is 44717
                 (Press any key to continue)
                 Bad Checksum on C:\IBMBIO.COM
                 Actual Checksum is 02147
                 Bad Checksum on C:\IBMDOS.COM
                 Actual Checksum is 54378
                 (Press any key to continue) 
Again I tried the SCANRES program from SCAN which give me now the
following messages:
           ? Warning! TSR request from an unregistered program!
           Number of paragraphs of memory (in decimal) are : 01258 
I would appreciate if any one can help me to find out how to disinfect
this.  Thank you for your kind attention.

Subject: Problems with NARC.EXE (PC)

   We are finding something suspicious when using a shareware program
that functions as a shell for pkarc or pkzip.  The program is called
NARC.EXE 4.0, and has an authorship by Infinity Design Concepts Inc.
1987.  Using the option for changing the drive designation calls up a
pull-down window.  At the top of the window, (which a look at a
hexdump of the executable code tells us should be blank), there is a
strange character string, in multicolor letters.  It says "Die R".
This struck us as rather odd.
   Nothing out of the ordinary has happened.  It may be that someone
has hacked the code as a practical joke.  But if anyone out there has
heard of this happening before, we would like to know about it. I'm
not trying to malign this shareware, we just want to know if perhaps
we might have been hit by a Trojan of some kind.
                                     Thanks;

Subject: found '12 Tricks Trojan' - what is it?

The program 'scan' found a virus, '12 Tricks Trojan [Tricks]' in a
public domain utility called 'superdir.com' (that gives you a sorted
list of all files in all directories).

The virus was in the program when it was freshly downloaded from a
local BBS. What does that virus do? Is it safe to use the program from
a floppy while the hard disk is temporarily write-protected by another
utility?

It would be nice to have a clean copy of that program, but I could not
remove the virus, and I couldn't find a clean copy on a local BBS.

Please don't listen to your boss  and try to disinfect your disks before
it destroys your data. I was  reading John McAfee's book about viruses a
few days ago and it said about some virus of the same sort which shows a
bouncing ball  while it is  reproducing and infecting other  programs in
the system.

This book said about another sort of virus which shows small bugs coming
out of all four  corners which eat (delete) the words  on the screen and
destroy all the data files meanwhile,

So I think it is better that you  check your system for virus and keep a
backup

Subject: '12 Tricks Trojan' virus question (PC)

Recently, I discovered that the public domain utility 'superdir.com'
contains the '12 Tricks Trojan' virus.

Although I have used it several times before I discovered this, it
apparently did not infect anything else. I also determined that the
virus was already in the version that I downloaded from a local BBS,
instead of entering the utility later on my system.

What does this virus do? It cannot be removed from the utility, and
I have not found an uninfected version of it on a local BBS.

Is it safe to run the infected utility from a floppy that has nothing
else on it, while temporarily write-protecting the hard disk with
another utility?

Subject: Hunter-Killer Vaccines

	It has recently been suggested in this journal that sending
out 'helpful' viruses that would infect machines and destroy harmful
viruses should be thought about.  I have and have reached these
conclusions: 1) It is a nice (even ethical) thing to do.  2) It would
not help virus programmer's in a technical sense.  If they can write
these things now, new algorithms are but a matter of time. 3) It
should not be done.
	It would be too easy to prey upon the unsuspecting, gullible,
and naive computer jock.  What virus authors wish to do is make people
into suckers and a great way to do that is to write a 'nice' program.
	"Hi.  I am a virus that hunts down others.  A - Happy Hunting.
B - Erase Virus Hunter" The victim presses A and in a few seconds up
pops "Hi.  The joke is on you sucker.  I just erased your hard disk"
	Unfortunately there is a even worse chance of the victim of a
virus attack to determine whether the program is friendly or hostile,
than getting one.  IF THE VICTIM BELIEVES THERE ARE NICE VIRUSES, he
has a 50-50 chance of saying yes to a modified version.  If everybody
has the COMPLETE understanding that all viruses should be treated with
vaccines and disk backups, the above scenario won't happen.

I have used all of SCAN, the IBM VIRSCAN and F-PROT.  I have found all

However, F-PROT is, in addition to less expensive, more complete in

At this point I would normally suggest that you call Ontrack and talk
to them.  However, given your location, I'm willing to call them for
you with any specific questions.  I'd like to point out first that
even if you use READ-ONLY, it is designed for normal write operations,
and a virus which ignore this will probably get around this.  (I'll
check if you ask me too).  Second, if you use their software for a
purpose it was never intended for (I did ask already) and you get
surprised, don't even consider blaming anyone but yourself.  Ontrack's
Disk Manager is not virus protection software!  I use McAfee's
products, myself.

Subject: SCANV66 controversy (PC)

   We recently placed (/pc/virus/)scanv66.zip for anonymous ftp
download from chyde.uwasa.fi, Vaasa, Finland, 128.214.12.3. 
   McAfee has benefited the PC community with excellent virus
checking facilities, but the new scanv66.zip includes a potentially
dangerous and controversial feature.  To quote:

    "This version of SCAN has added an option to
    transparently attach a CRC validation code to all of
    your executable files, your boot sector and your
    partition table.  This will help protect your system in
    case a virus unknown to SCAN is encountered.  SCAN will
    check these validation codes if requested and will
    alert the user to any files or system areas that have
    changed."

   Now there are two problems with this approach.  On the practical
side this method destroys a program's own virus selftest, if it has
one inbuilt based on checksums.  I may have made mistakes, but when I
tried scan /av out on two selftesting programs, the code that scan
attached naturally caused an alarm.  But what is really alarming is
that when I told scan to remove its code, the selftest failed even
after that.  This means that unless I made an error, scan could not
restore the files to their exact original state! The option /rv did
not work in my tests.

   The second problem is one of principle, and is best left for
legally minded persons to work out, but let me point out the dilemma.
What McAfee's scan does is that it certifiably adds code to the host
program, if the user so chooses.  Now this is tantamount to patching,
and very strictly speaking pacthing (at least copyrighted commercial)
programs may involve problems of legality.  I think that this is
something McAfee should have cleared very carefully before releasing
this potentially compromising method.  Having such a good reputation,
McAfee has at least taken a public risk here.  I really do not know,
but be that as may, the method has too much virus-resemblance for
comfort.

Subject: 4096 (PC)

	It was promised that after a look had been taken at the 4096,
a locating method would be posted: as was first surmised, when
resident available memory is reduced by a touch over 5k.

	The 4096/JOSHI did require a revision in my statement that
common viruses can be detected by looking at three bytes. It now takes
five bytes.  This does bear out the earlier comment as to why there
are few mainframe viruses (worms are easier) - once signature
algorithms become sophisticated enough, the simpler way becomes to
mislead the checker, not try to guess the algorithm.

	However, so long as the authentification mechanism is invoked
by the CONFIG.SYS (only thing better would be a ROM extension and that
means hardware) the 4096 should trigger a flag at least twice even if
the checker does not examine the environment periodically:

1) Virus is introduced (new file)

2) Virus is invoked (changed signature of first infected file loaded)
   at next boot.

	Of course, if the system is booted only from a write-protected
floppy and critical files are checked during boot, it will trigger a
warning each time.

	Incidently, Mr. McAfee's v66 is out (65 was skipped) and it
will flag the 4096 in memory unless the /nomem switch is set (you
don't do you ?)

=================================================================

	A bug in SCAN V66 has been discovered relating to removal of
validation codes from validated files.  Version 66-B, which fixes the
bug, will be released August 13.  If anyone has validated a program
with Version 66 and would like to remove the validation codes, use the
command:

			SCAN  Filespec /cv /rv

	This will remove the validation codes from the specified
files(s).  Version 66-B will obviate the need for the /CV option when
removing the codes.

To reply to some of Johnathan Vail's points:

  - As you probably know (I couldn't quite tell from your posting!)
    the checksum field in the header of EXE files is completely ignored
    by the operating system, so a virus infecting an EXE file
    doesn't have to worry about fixing it, or about leaving the
    file's checksum unchanged (some viruses use the field as the
    place to put their own self-id marker).
  - Since the checksum field in the EXE header is ignored, the kinds of
    checks that are useful in protecting against viruses are CRCs
    performed by an anti-virus utility that looks for file
    modifications.   Since there are lots and lots of possible
    CRCs, and a virus writer has no way of knowing in advance
    which ones his virus will encounter, it's not really possible
    to write a virus that makes modifications to a file in such a
    way as to fool any significant number of different CRC checks.
    (I agree that it's easy for a virus to fool a simple add-up-
    the-words checksum in the way you describe, but those are
    so insecure that no one uses them, as far as I know.)
  - Programs that check themselves for virus infection generally
    do it by examining themselves *on disk*, not by examining
    the in-RAM copy, for just the reasons that you give; the virus
    will generally fix the in-RAM copy to look normal before
    passing control to the "host".

As Ken points out, the 4096 (and other "stealth" viruses) defeats CRC
checks (and other modification-detectors) that are run while the virus
is in memory, by "lying" to programs about the contents of files.  As
Mr. Radai says, the best way to protect against this is to get the
machine into a trusted state before running the modification detector.
On the PC, this involves a cold boot from a trusted floppy; not
exactly convenient, but worth the trouble for critical systems...
