Subject: MAC Portable/SUM II nVIR Question (Mac)

A friend recently bought a MAC Portable [I am not a MAC expert] and has
purchased the SUM II Utilities package.

When he runs utilites from this package it reports that he has the nVIR
virus in his system file(v6.0.4).

The documentation does not list his machine as supported, and those
supported seem to have higher versions of the processor than the
portable's 68000.

Is this viral report due to a problem running the utilities on an
unsupported processor, or were his system distribution disks infected?  He
has had no 'outside' contact he is aware of.

I seriously doubt rtm will be getting any advances from publishers --
he has scrupulously avoided all comment to the media and is not
interested in the attention.  And the $10,000 fine is peanuts compared
to his legal fees (or, for that matter, the fact that he's lost many
of the rights of citizenship).

Perhaps the picture of a malicious programmer being thrown in jail would
do some good -- but this defendent didn't deserve that punishment.

I own a Z286 with a hard drive that also has a large partition only
available with Zenith's MS-DOS 3.3 plus.  I have had no problems with
SCAN on this partition but certain programs I use do have problems.
Those that come to mind are PC-Tools 4.? and a directory sorter
(dirsort or dirord I can't remember which one doesn't like that
partition).

I had just learned to live with it and assumed that as programs are
updated they would start to better recognize these new large
partitions.

I have cross posted this to comp.zenith maybe somebody there knows
something.

Problem with autovalidating a program using an eprom is that 1)
There's a lot of Public domain software out there that still won't be
validated in any way and 2) There's a limited amout of eprom sockets
in your computer.  If everyone started this practice, you'd fast run
out of space.

It's been pointed out to me that any SERIOUS steps taken to prevent
virii by the OS will also limit programmers so much as to make the
computer useless.

Hi!  I am not sure if this is the symptom of a virus - sometimes when
I boot my computer, it executes my autoxec partially, then suddenly
and for no reason, blanks out and reboots itself as if I hit the big
red switch!  This could happen two or three times successively before
it finally gives me my C prompt!  It usually happens when I start the
system in the morning; I usually leave it on all day, so that's about
the only time I really reboot (unless it hangs).

I ran SCANV64, and turned up nothing.  What do you think?  Any hints,
suggestions, recommendations are extremely welcome.  You could reply
directly or to the net.  Thanks!

But viruses don't *need* to have the environment under their exclusive
control, and neither do virus writers!  I'm not sure where people are
getting these ideas from; I suspect many of us are being fooled by the
fact that the machines that have viruses today are mostly machines in
which a program can do absolutely anything.  But viruses don't *need*
that ability!

All a virus has to do to spread is
   - Find out what writeable executables exist
   - Read from and write to one or more of them (in specific ways)

Neither those things, nor testing a program that does those
things, requires any special privileges, and certainly not
having "exclusive control" of the machine.

Sorry for harping on this so, but it seems a very common misconception,

For the benefit of virus trackers...

The Stoned virus has hit Tennessee Technological University.  I
estimate it has been on campus for approximately 3-4 weeks; it was
brought to my attention the week of April 30.

We have taken steps to check for and eliminate the virus; however, it
was detected just as the end of our spring semester was upon us.  We have
done everything possible to alert everyone to the danger of this virus.

All a virus *is* is a trojan. It's just a trojan that copies itself
when triggered, rather than doing something like creating a trapdoor
or copying other files. The trick is making it copy itself somewhere
it is likely to get triggered again.

We have encounterd a virus at UQAM which SCANV62 diagnoses as the
Stoned viurs.  CLEAN62 indicates the virus cannot be safely removed
from the boot sector.  Is it necessary to reformat the hard disk, or
is there a less drastic solution?

I have also tried FPROT109. F-SYSCHK shows the virus is in memory.
Running VSHLD62 flags the virus as being in memroy and seems to remove
it frm memory; F-SYSCHK shows no viruses.

Is the FPROT109 package sufficient to prevent reinfection in a
computer lab setting?

It should be easier to restore the system to its former state because
the MVS operating system would keep the virus in your own account
only.  At least until you let someone copy one of your executables.
Therefore, you would only have to restore *your* account not the whole
system.

Besides, if you want a virus to spread, wouldn't you expect to get infected
yourself?  Why restore anything?

Subject: Macintosh virus detection program in planning - help needed (Mac)

     A few months ago, I posted a message on comp.virus requesting
bibliographic sources concerning anti-viral (infection detection and
prevention) utilities.  First, I'd like to thank everyone who responded,
especially Jan Christian van Winkel in the Netherlands.

     I am now looking for a good Macintosh toolbox programming
package, most preferably of the type the was used to develop
applications such as Stuffit (the file compression utility) and
Disinfectant.  Currently, I am looking at the Macintosh Programmer's
Workshop and other older file edit utilities (Mac Tools, etc).  Could
someone recommend a good set of programming tools for development of
what I expect to be a relatively low-level (assembler based) task?  I
am prepared to learn Mac assembler if it is required.

     I would also appreciate it if someone could send me a list of some of
the E-mail addresses of the people who developed Disinfectant with John
Norstad.  I have sent mail to him, but it seems he doesn't have the complete
address list.

     Finally, I remember reading a series of posts about universal virus
detectors during last winter and early spring of this year.  I'm not certain
what the general consensus was at the end of that discussion, but I recall
that a formal proof against the possibility of such a detector was cited.
Could someone please advise me on the details of the proof (and
counterarguments)?  Thank you very much.

From:    sneaky!gordon@uunet.UU.NET (Gordon Burditt)
Subject: Re: Military Viruses

I have extreme doubts about the feasability of introducing and propogating
viruses only by military radio.  Viruses propogate by infecting the "media"
used to transfer executable programs (primarily floppy disks, network
connections, and serial links hardwired or via modem) and then having
the executable executed.

Does the Army really download new versions of software in the middle
of a battle?  I hope not.  Granted, without a virus, by broadcasting
appropriate messages, you could fake out the enemy battle computers into
believing that enemy units were friendly and vice versa, at least until
the real source of information updated it again.  And you could attempt
to jam enemy communications and issue fake orders.  Hopefully, this sort
of information is encrypted (which doesn't mean foolproof).  None of this
is particularly new, either.  But this only screws up the data base, not
the operating programs.  Switching to an alternate encryption key and
getting a full update would repair most of the problem.

A much more likely virus attack would be to infect the programs
used to control the computers by passing out infected programs to
the enemy soldiers operating the computers weeks, months, or years in
advance.  This could be done by a traitor within the enemy's armed
forces, or civilians who know the soldiers.  The infected programs
would be something likely to spread - games, useful utilities, or
X-rated pictures.  Then, on command by radio in the middle of a battle,
all the computers display an upraised middle finger and respond
"Die, Capitalist Imperialist Pigs!" in response to any command.
Or, the warheads in all the computer-guided missiles simply explode,
or they attack whatever launched them.  Attempts to go to backup copies of
the software probably wouldn't work.

Question for those operating packet-switched radio BBS and modem land-line
based BBS systems which DO NOT support uploads or downloads of executable
programs - Have you ever had a virus infection transmitted to, from, or
through your system via communication links which did NOT involve uploading,
downloading, or compiling of an executable program?

It is possible to infect human beings with the equivalent of a virus
transmitted by sound and light waves.  This is usually referred to as
"advertising".  However, humans are built to receive all but the simplest
programming through the senses.

Subject: The 'fictitious' Sneak (mac) virus summary

A short time ago I queried the net in relation to the Sneak Virus as
identified by Interferon and was asked to summarise the responses.
Thanks to all those who replied.

I said ......
> I dont normally read this group, but does anyone know what can fix it?
> Interferon 3.1 identified the Sneak virus (Disinfectant 1.7 doesn't) in
> a Tops startup document. The virus cause various DA memory errors and ID=3
> and ID=2 bombs. Please email me direct.

I received ......

1. Interferon 3.1 is seriously out of date, don't use it. Use Virex
(commercial) or Disinfectant 1.7 (shareware)

2. There is no such thing as a sneak virus.  Robert Woodhead was attempting to
flag suspicious activity that might someday be connected with a new virus.
He's since apologized profusely to the user community for the mistake.  He
also recommends that no-one use Interferon anymore, so I'd just trash the
obsolete application.
I don't know what's causing your ID=3 and 2 bombs in Tops (or wherever
they're occurring).  Tops 2.0 is buggy on my machines - I don't know about
3.0 or newer versions.

3. This is a bug in Interferon; for some reason, it thought Tops file
contained a virus.  Why hasn't this bug been fixed?  It has, in a way;
Virex doesn't have this problem.  The guy who wrote Interferon no
longer supports it, and now writes Virex.  There was a day or two of
panic over this at my old office, especially since one or two of us
had Tops, along with several other inits, turned off via Aask init,
which causes the init's icon to be a generic document icon.  We were
sure we were suffering a major virus outbreak....
TOPS is incorrectly identified as having a "Sneak" virus by Interferon.  My
latest TOPS update (v. 3.0) even notes this in the documentation.
GET RID OF INTERFERON!

4. It is outdated and can make your virus situation worse by raising false
suspicions such as the situation you ask about.  Disinfectant is up to date
and much more thorough an anti-viral program than Interferon ever was.  Use it
instead!


5. The "Sneak" virus identified by Interferon is not really a virus, but
rather a name for the fact that Interferon has found a file to be an
INIT which it should not be. While this could be a sign of viral infection,
TOPS files are known to trigger false alarms in Interferon. Therefore
my suggestion: Use Disinfectant 1.7 instead, and use Vaccine or Gatekeeper
to stop virii from spreading.
The system errors you see probably have a different origin like a corrupted
system file or a mix of components from different TOPS releases. My
suggestion: Replace the system file, and re-install TOPS.

So thanks everyone, I got the message. I was suspicious that Disinfectant
didn't identify something that Interferon did, but then better to be sure!
So get rid of interferon and dont blame a virus (like I did) when its
something else (that requires a bit of s'ware reinstallation).

I just received a letter from Vesselin Bontchev, the Bulgarian virus
researcher.  The letter contained 28 pages of virus descriptions (on
odd yellowish paper), comments on some of the anti-virus packages he
took with him back to Bulgaria etc.

He gave me permission to post the information I felt was of interest to
VIRUS-L/comp.virus readers, so here is a short description of the Bulgarian
viruses that have appeared since he went back to Bulgaria, two months ago.

	2 new variants of Dark Avenger, where the text messages are
	replaced with blanks, in addition to other minor changes.
	The author of DA has now released the source code, which
	will probably result in a number of variants of the virus in a
	few months.
	Another variant of "2000" - "Copy me - I want to travel" is
	replaced by "Only the Good die young..."  "Diana P." is now
	written in cyrillics, instead of ASCII.


	Number of the Beast - three new versions, none of which
	contain "666" any more.  The major differences are just
	corrections of a few bugs.


	Pixel/Amstrad - one new version, only 277 bytes long. Text messages
	are gone, replaced by a code to print "Parity error" 50% of the time
	when an infected program is run.


	"Toothless" (V534).  This virus is from the Soviet Union.  Basically
	it is a version of Vienna, created by a clumsy programmer - infected
	files are not marked by setting the "seconds" field to 62, but by
	setting the "month" field to 13 - which is of course easily seen.
	The virus contains a number of bugs.


	"Murphy" infects .EXE and .COM files. It is partially based upon
	the Dark Avenger virus. The virus will use features of DOS 4.0,
	(function 6C).  The virus contains the message:

	Hello, I'm Murphy. Nice to meet you friend.
	I'm written since Nov/Dec.
	Copywrite (c) 1989 by Lubo & Ian, Sofia, USM Laboratory."
	Two versions are known.  The authors of the viruses are known:

	Lubomir Mateev Mateev        Iani Lubomirov Brankov
	Sofia,                       Mihailovgrad,
	ul. "Budapeshta" 14          ul. "G. Damianov" 6
	Bulgaria                     Bulgaria

	Tel: 80-28-26                Tel: 2-13-34


	"800" virus. Memory resident. Infects when files are read or executed.
	Infects .COM files other than COMMAND.COM.  Contains the string
	"Live after Death", after it decrypts itself.

I hope to have a workig copy of the viruses soon.
