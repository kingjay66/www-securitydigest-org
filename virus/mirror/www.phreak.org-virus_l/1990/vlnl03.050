VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: CoTRA virus sig meeting

A number of British readers may be aware that the Computer Threat
Research Association was formed recently to address a wide range of
computer security and integrity issues, including the establishment of
a central library of viral materials and an active research group for
work on viruses.

As virus SIG co-ordinator I would like to arrange a meeting of the SIG
in the last week of March, issues I hope to discuss are establishment
of:

1. A central UK library of viral materials available to all bona-fide
   virus researchers (fortunately the definition of bona-fide is being
   tackled by another committee)
2. A number of sites with a test bed set of viruses for evaluation
   of commercial and public domain anti-viral products
3. A network of formal or informal connections to deal with future occurences
   of bulk mailed trojan horses, major new viral strains or network worms

The AIDS trojan horse clearly indicated the lack of a well organised
network of virus/trojan workers in the field. The response, while
enthusiastic, did duplicate much effort accross a number of separate
sites. While I realise that commercial considerations often temper the
distribution of information between workers in the field, I feel that
issues such as the AIDS trojan must circumvent industrial
confidentiality to allow a sharing of information, and division of
workload. With complex disassemblies it is likely that details of
protection mechanisms (particularly self-modifying code) may be missed
by one researcher and detected by another. The cross-checking of
disassemblies is vital to the accuracy of the final product.

The Internet worm caused formalisation of the "old-boy" network,
resulting in the creation of an excellent rapid response system (CERT)
with formal links with established experts in the field. I hope that
such a structure will evolve in the UK, preferably with government
recognition of the important role that such an organisation will play
in the security and integrity of personal and mainframe computer
systems.

I would be interested in any feedback on the above comments
(preferably constructive criticism). Hopefully such a reporting
network will not be restricted to member of CoTRA but will include all
workers in the field (academic, commercial and governmental).

IBM has made only one version of The IBM Virus Scanning Program
available to the public; this is version 1.0, that was released in
September of 1989.  Any other versions of the IBM program are marked
IBM Internal Use Only, and are not available to the public at this
time.  We definitely urge people *not* to use any program marked IBM
Internal Use Only (except for IBM internal use, of course, or if you
have a specific agreement signed with IBM allowing you to use it).

Subject: Stoned Virus (PC)

We discovered the Stoned Virus in our PC's recently. Does anyone have
any suggestions on how to get rid of this. We have hundreds of users
who have their own floppies, most of them infected I suppose. It would
be difficult to call them all in. Is there some way of automating
this? Any suggestions will be appreciated.

Bad news, Cliff --

Yesterday I visited a discount book outlet, BOOKS-A-MILLION, and
there, big as life, was a pile of _The_Cuckoo's_Egg_'s, $13.95.
(Why couldn't I have gotten that price when I bought four copies?)

I just tried calling the number (800)-835-2246 about the upcoming
virus conference. The lady who answered asked be who I was calling
*for*, not from.  I repeated the number verbally; she said she
couldn't tell what company I was trying to reach because their
computers were down, and she had tried and failed to find the
information another way. (Yes, I'm going to submit this item to
RISKS.)

I had intended to suggest that detailed conference information be
posted on the VIRUS-L.

Subject: Virus Disinfections (PC)

          This is a forward from John McAfee:
=================================================================

          A number of Virus-L entries over the past couple of months
have discussed virus disinfection issues and the problems with
disinfecting certain viruses.  Vesselin Bontchev yesterday wrote:

>I spoke with David Chess (at IBM) and he prefers the "delete the
>infected file and restore them from backups" method.  But have in
>mind, that the guy from Taiwan is in trouble --- and may not have
>appropriate backups.

          I understand Vesselin's point, but in general I favor Dave's
approach.  In spite of the fact that I produce and distribute a
number of disinfector programs, including CLEAN-UP, I always
suggest deleting as a first choice.  There are many reasons for
this, but the primary one is that the process of disinfecting a
file always leaves an element of uncertainty in the system.
          For example, the Jerusalem virus uses information in the EXE
header record to determine how to infect.  Often this header record
is inaccurate, causing the virus to overlay part of the EXE file,
and also causing the virus to update the header record incorrectly.
The virus has, in effect, destroyed part of the EXE file, and this
destruction is often not noticed immediately by the user.  The
corrupted area might be seldom referenced, or in a program function
area that is bypassed in normal processing.  If this is the case,
removal will leave a program that will at some point cause
inconsistencies, data corruption, or system crashes when the erased
area is referenced.  There is simply no way to recover the file
because there is no way (short of using the original uninfected
program) to determine what was in the file before it was
overwritten.
          The Jerusalem is not alone in causing these problems.  There
are numerous EXE infectors and some COM infectors (405, Vienna)
that cannot be successfully recovered in all cases.  What
complicates the matter is that it cannot be determined in advance
(in all cases) which files will disinfect correctly and which will
not.  We are left then with a system that will have no more
viruses, but we may have applications that are subtly corrupted.
This is not good.  A program that seems to work, but may have brain
damage in a seldom used subroutine, can be as troublesome as a
virus.
          In addition to the above problems, many viruses are
continually being modified so that identification may still work,
but disinfection will cause complete destruction of the file due
to changed offsets and other programming issues.
          To get back to my point, I would strongly suggest that
infected files be overwritten in their entirety and then deleted
if at all possible.  Only as a last resort, where backups or
original diskettes are unavailable, should disinfection be used.

Subject: 1701/1704 Ver. B virus and SCAN/CLEAN Ver. 2.7 V57 (PC)

I had a following problem: when I requested a directory of my floppy
disk, the machine (Toshiba 3100, DOS 3.2) read the floppy directory
just once, ie, every successive request for floppy directory displayed
the data from the ram, WITHOUT re-reading of actual data from the
floppy. Even when chan- ging the floppy, the same thing occured, ie
directory of the previous floppy was displayed. I decided to check for
the virus and downloaded McAfee's SCAN/CLEAN package (Ver. 2.7 V57)
from our public domain archive (Lancaster University). I ran the SCAN
and it reported 1701/1704 Version B virus, with id code [170X] in
about 10 *.com files (command.com was one of them). I replaced the
infected command.com (booted from a clean floppy, ran SCAN, and
replaced command.com), and then, since my backup's are at home, ran
CLEAN, which claimed that it has repaired those remaining com files.
Two of infected files (CED.COM and DOSEDIT.COM) where OK, ie following
the CLEAN, I ran the CED (DOSEDIT - not at the same time), and re-ran
the SCAN, and everything was OK. A number of other files
(MODE.COM,MORE.COM,MOUSE.COM,LIST.COM,GREP.CO where apparently clean
(CLEAN reported that it has succesfully recovered them) BUT after
running them (they behaved as they should), SCAN again reported that
1701/1704 was IN THE MEMORY, but couldn't find them IN THE FILES.  Can
anyone (maybe John McAfee) comment on that?

Best regards,
             Nino

Subject: Posting scan signatures.

Possibly a useful approach to posting virus scan patterns would be for
virologists to extract one or more segments of the virus code of, say,
1K bytes (that's a fairly reasonable 12 lines at 80 bytes per line).
>From that posted segment or segments, the user community could
arbitrarily select a substring or substrings to use for recognition of
the virus.  Presumably no two users would select the same substrings, so
virus writers would have to alter the entire posted segment to escape
detection.  Yet the segment would not be executable (with luck!)  so
posting it would not run the risk of spreading a "live" virus.

This leaves the question of how many bytes the user should include in
the scan pattern to avoid false alarms.  Possibly the person posting the
segment could provide guidance on this, or a general guideline could be
used based on the size of the storage device to be scanned.  (Anybody
know offhand the entropy per byte of virus code?)

Of course, viruses can be constructed which alter themselves at each
replication, making any search with a fixed string futile, or at best,
"challenging" to design.

Subject: Ping Pong Virus (PC)

An IMB PC with a hard disk in a lab of ours was infected with the Ping Pong
Virus. I know that the Ping Pong Virus is a boot infector virus so we removed
it by using the DOS SYS command.  However, I have other questions about the
virus.  If you have an answer please reply via the newsgroup or my mailing
address: mckeeby@andy.bgsu.edu.

          1.  How does the virus spread?
          2.  Are there available detection/protection programs
              to safeguard against new infections.  What are they?
          3.  How is the virus activated?
          4.  What does the virus do besides infect the boot sector?
          5.  Is the DOS SYS command the best way to remove the infection?
          6.  Are there public domain programs to remove an infection
              of the ping-pong / bouncing ball virus? What are they?
          7.  Is the ping-pong and the bouncing ball virus the same virus?
          8.  An infected user said they had the Brain virus on there disk
              and before using the infected ping-ponged hard disk it was
              clean.  Is there any correlation between these two viruses?
              I don't think so, but I want to make sure.
