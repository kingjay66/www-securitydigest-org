VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

  First of all, I'd like it to be clear that I was not recommending
Disk Manager as an anti-viral product, but merely pointing out that
Michael Greve's reference to DM as hard-disk protection was not as
absurd as it apparently sounded to some readers (some of whom may have
been unaware of the possibility of making a partition read-only when
using DM).

  Secondly, the fact that DM was not designed for anti-viral purposes
does not necessarily mean that the read-only option can't be useful in
preventing infection by file viruses.  Now if the protection were im-
plemented by setting the read-only bit of each file in the protected
partition, then you'd be right, for almost every virus clears this bit
before trying to infect the file.  But DM uses a device driver to con-
trol all access to the logical drive, and that's a different story.
True, it might still be possible to circumvent this protection, but I
think it would be a lot harder.  It should also be taken into account
that very few virus writers would bother trying to write code to by-
pass a particular anti-viral program unless that program were used on
a very large percentage of computers.

Subject: Virus Nomenclature

	Skulason has indicated the great lack of uniformity in
designating viruses very clearly.  I suggest that method IV - Size of
virus, holds the most promise.
	We can look upon method IV as a simple checksum.  However, it
is unsuited for the job in that there could be great confusion, as
viruses have a fairly good chance (especially variants) of being
nearly the same size.  Therefore, a checksum algorithm, which can look
at the way the virus is constructed, rather than the length of it's
construction would be a suitable answer.  The requirements it must
meet are 1) a large range to avoid duplicate assignments and 2) a
fairly simple algorithm, that can be published and understood easily.
Thus, unambiguous, dull sounding, and names accepted world-wide would
be easy.  Just isolate the virus code, run it through the algorithm,
and presto!
	I also suggest that the year of occurence be appended onto the
identification number in order that it would make it easier to track
the spread of the virus through time, providing easy measures of
virulence and population size.

One of my collegues here works on a PC-compatible machine and wants to
get some public domain anti-viral software.  I work on a Mac, so I
couldn't help him.  I would like to know the names and sources of some
anti-viral software, as well as some ftp sources for these packages,
as well as the decoding software one might need to decode it from its
stored form.

Thanks for any assistance,

Subject: Powerpoint file/Mac Crash (Mac)

I just received a call from a user who had an unusual problem with his
Mac II CX.  Can anyone out there give me a clue?

A disk with a Powerpoint Version 2.01D user file was copied to this
user's Mac.  The user attempted to access this file from PowerPoint
Ver 2.01 and the background colors on the document changed from blue
to black for approximately 65 percent of the document, and then caused
the Mac to crash.  After restarting the mac the color was able to be
restored to the document, and the machine operated normally.  BUT,
shortly after doing some work, the Mac reset with no user
intervention.

The person who originally created this file (a contractor) was
contacted, and stated they had created the document on Powerpoint
Versions 2.0, 2.01, and 2.01D, and experienced no problems in doing
this.  AFTER they delivered this document to my user, they also
experienced the same problem with the document background colors and
also experienced the crash.  [no comment was made by my user about any
'automatic reset' at this time]

A scan was done using Disinfectant 2.0: no virus was detected.  The
user also examined the disk with SUM II [sic] utility file and the
disk checked out OK.

The Mac involved is on a local Mac net with less than 10 other mac's
on the network.  The machine is not shared and has only one user.  No
other Mac's on the network have experienced any problems.

My question to Virus-L is Has anyone else experienced the same type of
problem, is this something new, or any other comments on the
situation.  The user is currently still using the machine, and nothing
more has happened since all this.  I told the user to keep an eye out
for anything at all unusual and to call me immediately should
something happen.  Also, all diskettes into/out of the machine are
either quarantined or kept track of closely.

Two or three weeks ago, there was a discussion of infections of
LaserWriter printers that modified the password stored in EEPROMs.
The discussion mentioned an article in a recent issue of MacWeek, but
did not include the date of the issue.  Could someone post a precise
reference to the MacWeek article including date and page number?

Thank you very much.

  OFFICE MEMO          Virus Alert                             Date: 8/20/90
We have just received a report that SecureWare, Inc. has, for a short time been
shipping its CMW+ product with a Mac OS partition that is infected with the
nVir virus (mostly files in the system folder). The Virex program will
successfully detect this virus.
    SecureWare was alerted and, upon investigation, established that their
master system was indeed infected. As a result, all drives shipped by
SecureWare are potentially infected, including those provided with the WIS
workstations. SecureWare will be sending letters to all their customers
explaining the situation and hopefully providing a remedy.
   This is all of the information that we have at this time. Please alert those
users in your areas of this virus alert. If any are using this product, urge
them to use rid their machines of the virus and to contact SecureWare.

With response to James Li (Uk.AC.OXFORD) ....

  It looks like you have had a case of INT 26 (I Believe) calls. This causes an
absolute disk-write of some area of preogram memory onto the disk.

  I believe this to be so, as when I was exercising some assembler code a few
weeks ago, I made the mistake of entering an INT 26H call instead of an INT 21H
call, and the result was a very-unusable floppy (which was a work-diskette
fortunately!!).

  On obtaining a directory of the diskette, I received a similar result to
what you have described. I would therefore suggest that either

   A> Some of your source code contains an INT 26H call that it shouldn't.

   B> Some of your coding has gone terminally ill.

 It could always be a virus, tho....

Subject: New Book of Interest

I just received a copy of the book "Rogue Programs: Viruses, Worms,
and Trojan Horses," edited by Lance J. Hoffman.  The book is published
by Van Nostrand Reinhold, copyright 1990, ISBN 0-442-00454-0.  The
publisher's suggested list price is $32.95, in softcover.

This book is a collection of 27 articles and book excerpts about
"vandalware" on computer systems.  Contributors include Len Adleman,
Anne Branscomb, David Chess, Fred Cohen, George Davida, David
Ferbrache, Michael Gemignani, Harold Joseph Highland, me (!), Ken
Thompson, Steve White, and many others.  The table of contents lists
the following parts: Overview of Rogue Programs, Social and Legal
Issues and Effects, Rogue Programs and Personal Computers, Rogue
Programs and Networks, and Emerging Theory of Computer Viruses.

Perhaps I'm somewhat biased because I'm the author or co-author of 3
of the 27 contributions.  However, I believe this is the most
comprehensive collection on the topic currently available.  It
contains case studies, theoretical analyses, legal opinions, and
step-by-step technical information.  The book is valuable as both a
technical reference and as a textbook around which a course can be
organized.  I'm sure it is going to become one of the 2 or 3 standard
references in the field (the forthcoming book from ACM Press edited by
Peter Denning will probably be the other).

If you are interested in some of the issues involving viruses, worms
and vandalware, you really should get a copy of this book and check it
out.

Subject: Re: Antivirus viruses

    I think there are situations in which the release of such viruses
would be both ethical and desirable.

    I can think of at least one precedent from the medical profession
- - the Saulk (sp?) vaccine (the primary polio vaccine in the US).  This
vaccine is a live, contagious, virus. Any Physician who administers it
is releasing a virus into the population. This is considered an
advantage. Contagion is not considered a problem because:

1 - The virus is beneficial (it blocks a much more virulent virus)

2 - It is intended that the entire population be inoculated anyway.

    The computer analog of such a transmissible live attenuated virus
would be a version of a highly destructive virus from which the
destructive code has been removed. The vaccine would spread to exactly
the population susceptible to the original virus, because it would
spread by the same mechanism and would be stopped by the same
protective software. It would then compete with the virulent virus by
means of of its shared self recognition site.

To be effective such a vaccine would have to reach a target machine
before the virulent strain. This can be insured in two ways.

a - by making the vaccine spread more rapidly than its target. Small
    increases (which could result simply from the removal of the
    destructive payload) might be sufficient. Regardless of how fast
    it spreads, however, the vaccine will sill arrive too late for
    some machines.

b - Give the vaccine a head start by distributing it widely by means other
    than contagion. E.g by distributing it as part of a package of
    anti-viral tools.

Possible objections:

A - The vaccine would lull people into a false sense of security.
Response - The people who don't have conventional anti-viral software (which
    would stop both the target virus and the vaccine) have a false sense
    of security already.

B - The vaccine will inevitably contain bugs which will harm some users.
Response - So does the polio vaccine. Through mutation into virulent forms and
    unusually susceptible individuals, the polio vaccine does (rarely) cause
    disease. People die from it. This is considered acceptable because
    the vaccine reduces the total probability of disease.

C - If this is allowed there will be a flood of "beneficial" viruses.
Response - I am not suggesting that every hacker (in either the prejorative
    sense of the word or not) be given license to go out and release his own
    vaccine to any virus he sees fit. Unilateral release of a virus is
    unconscionable and should be illegal. But with proper review and testing
    through a "computer FDA", use of live vaccines Should not be dismissed
    out of hand.
