VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

FYI, I'll be out of town all of next week (European Unix Users Group,
in case any of you are also attending and want to look me up and say
hi).  I will try to get to a terminal and send out VIRUS-L/comp.virus
as time permits, but service is likely to be erratic at best.

As always, feel free to send infection reports to VALERT-L.  However,
anyone sending to VALERT-L should follow-up with a phone call to the
CERT hotline at 412-268-7090, or else it might (read: will) not be
noticed until I return.  Also, if posting, leave an explicit message
with whoever answers the hotline that you have sent a message to
VALERT-L and would like it to be distributed as soon as possible.  I
will leave instructions with the rest of the crew here asking them to
forward any urgent VALERT-L messages to the list.

I apologize for any inconvenience that this may cause.

Regards,

Ken

	We have just removed the STONED virus from a user's PC. What
is unusual is that the user who discovered the infection reported that
it appeared after accidently rebooting with a utility disk taken out
of a sealed envelope that came with the motherboard.

	In checking the area, we found no other floppies containing
the virus and on contacting the vendor, we were told that they had had
other reports and were recalling the disk and providing removal
software to anyone who had become infected.

	Salient facts: the disk came in a sealed envelope stamped
"MCT-286" and having an imprint resembling a floppy disk over the
opening flap. The imprint has 6 decimal digits in blue and what appear
to be chinese characters in red. The disk inside has a professional
label in silver and white with graphics & legends: "MODULAR CIRCUIT
TECHNOLOGY", "Utility Diskette". This disk was not write-protected.

	Since this reportedly occurred immediately following an
initial low level format on receipt of the hard disk and neither the
DOS (used to format the drive) disk nor any of the other floppies in
the area were infected, we have a strong certainty that the disk was
infected prior to being received.

Subject: RE:Ohio Virus found at UTMB (PC)

     A few days ago, I announced that the OHIO virus has infected
several PCs here at UTMB. Well, there is a whole new twist to the
story now.

     After consulting with John McAfee and running a few tests,
it has been determined that in the proper environment, the OHIO
virus changes from a relatively benign virus into a potent disk
destroyer!

     The virus was discovered on several 5.25 inch floppy disks
on a PC connected to a VAX 8250 using DECnet DOS 2.1. Almost all
diskettes used on the PC after infection were damaged so badly
that they had to be completely re-formatted before they were
usable again. In addition, the virus was also discovered on
several 3.5 inch floppies. The virus isn't supposed to be able to
do this!

     Apparently the combination of the OHIO virus and DECnet DOS
2.1 creates a contention between the TSRs that causes havoc. I
hope someone out there in VIRUS-L land can reproduce this problem
and either confirm or refute my findings.

In the Oct 8, 1990 issue of "COMPUTERWORLD" on page 134, there is
mention of a Telecomm Virus (V92).  Has anyone heard of this?  Has
anyone heard of 1st Defense Anti-Viral Systems as well?  Thanks

Subject: Federman's comments

"I have run a PC lab "virus free" for the last three years. We use a
Novel network, with student PCs equiped with auto-bootup ROMS on the
network cards. The students cannot write to the server hard disk, only
access applications and data. The student PCs do not have hard disks.
No floppies are handed out by staff. Students can download shareware
and licensed software.  They cannot make a DOS diskette. We also run
the McAlfee program (WE ARE LICENSED FOR IT!) A student can check a
floppy for possible infection."

Obviously that is a way of keeping a network clean, but it is not
foolproof.  I run a 3Com network in essentially the same manner (no
home directories for students).  The problem is that some educational
software must be located in Read/Write/Create directories, i.e. open
directories.  Fortunately, unless we are dealing with a malicious act
on the part of the user, the chances of getting a virus through the
use of open directories are small because the applications do not
require the insertion of any outside diskettes.  I also use Saber
Meter, and that requires a Read/Write/Create directory.  So far my
luck has held out.  Most network administrators try to keep
directories write-protected as regards everyone but themselves.
However, hard disks on the local nodes tend to pick up all sorts of
things, and if you happen to decide to or must administer from a
public machine, once you go into the system with Read/Write/Create
capabilities, you have opened it up to viruses.

"They cannot make a DOS diskette."  Why that policy?

An aside: one LAN manager on this campus swears by 3Com for the Mac,
stating that one big advantage is that an individual's account may be
infected, but the virus cannot travel to other files on the disk
because Mac viruses cannot travel in a DOS environment.  Anyone care
to comment?

Subject: Postscript Trojan Horse

I was tying to followup on the Trojan horse issue with postscript but my
computer gives me some 411 error and says something about to much text?
  So I'll try a new posting.  Apples service notice for october(read
and post) gives symptoms and solution to the LaserWriter Trojan Horse.
They offer a utility on applelink to make the fix(sets password back
to the default "0".)  Look in the technical info library and use the
search string "LaserWriter and Trojan Horse" to locate the utility.

I also received the same message from the mysterious researcher.  I think
we should be more careful with anybody claiming that he or she is a researcher
It is better to have someone that we can ask to verify a researcher.
Here is the message that I got.  Notice the account name that made me curious
when I received this mail.

In article <0010.9008311810.AA27971@ubu.cert.sei.cmu.edu> you write:
>"Sudah ada vaksin" is an Indonesian language which is mean "There is a

Do you have further information on this article or either of these viruses?
If so, we would be interested in information for the purposes of analyzing
these viruses (especially the Mardi virus). Specifically, do you have
either a specimen of these virus for comparison purposes, or more info
on this magazine article? Thanks in advance.

Subject: Need anti-viral for music virus.

Our site is in need of a anti-viral to eliminate the following problem:

A virus that plays music.  It plays a 41 note song which is possibly the
national anthem of some country.  The virus activates after 5000 keystrokes.
An identifying comment from the virus code is:
"ABT Group., Oct 13th, 1989 at FCU."

Since this virus has probably been around for a year an anti-viral program
from another site would be appreciated.  An in-house solution is being written.


If you have an anti-viral please send it to:

Subject: New MacVirus?

I am hoping someone out there can help me.

I have recently come across a Macintosh which is displaying strange
symptoms. (*You won't believe this...*)

It seems "little kitty-cat faces" appear in the menu bars from time to
time.  Immediately afterward, the machine reboots itself. The person
who uses this machine is no help to me. She is the one who described
it as "little kitty-cat faces".

Has anyone heard of a virus which does this?

Todd,

    I am very new to reading this newsgroup, and I am sorry for the
delay in answering your question.

[From the description in your article...I believe...]

    Your modem has been struck by lightning. There is nothing that can
be done for it. Just pull it out/disconnect it, and replace it.  It
happens all the time. Don't be too concerned about it. I don't think
there is anything that you can do about it. Phones are designed to be
able to take the burst when it comes down the line, modems are just
not capable of taking it.

    A direct hit on your phone lines will let lightning into your
system where it will bounce from board to board and destroy
everything.  Be glad this didn't occur to you.

Rendell
