VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for iscussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: Stoned virus technical report (PC)

Seeing the recent articles in lists.virus about the Stoned virus, I
did some recent work on clearing this virus, and prepared an article
(unpublished as at now) as appended.  It's a bit long (750 lines), so
I am hesitant to put it into the newsgroup without advice from
someone like you.

My article describes how the virus manifests itself, how it
propogates, and gives the algorithm used.  A source listing of the
code takes up 250 lines, and it might well be of interest to someone
who wishes to learn how these wretched things work.

Feel free to put it into the newsgroups or anywhere else, simply
acknowledge the source as mine.

This was posted on Applelink this morning.  Obviously, the original

A new virus was discovered in Italy called the ZUC.Virus (after Don
Zucchin who brought it to the attention of Francesco Giagnorio who sent it
to me) that causes the cursor to "go crazy" within a few minutes after an
infected
application is run.

PRELIMINARY information shows it to infect applications only by adding a
1256 byte piece of code at the end of the first executed CODE resource
(much the same way the ANTI virus works).

An infected application can be detected using VirusDetective 3.1.1 (or
later) by adding the search string:

 Resource Start & Pos -1256 & Data 082A#F1655#30832 ; For finding ZUC.Virus

At this point it is my personal belief that this virus is not wide-spread
since Francesco spent around a month isolating it and no other "strange"
reports have been seen. I would appreciate hearing from anyone who
discovers this virus to see just how wide-spread it is.

More info will be forthcoming as more is known about this virus.  It has
been sent to the Mash Mac Anti-Virus task force which I, and all the other
Mac anti-viral authors, are on.

What ZUC.Virus will do 90 seconds after launching an infected application
is take over the cursor and move it diagonally until you reboot.  After
looking at the code it seems harmless (though it can reboot your machine
if it can't get the memory it needs) but VERY infectious.  More news to
follow.  It only infects applications.

Subject: Files on PC growing by 128 bytes (PC)

Where one finds a set of files that are 128 bytes too long, I would suspect
that someone used the MSDOS BACKUP utility to copy a diskful of files,
and some or all of the files were read onto the destination machine
with COPY. Diskettes created by BACKUP have all the files under their original
names, but there's a 128 byte header added to allow RESTORE to merge
pieces of files correctly (and probably tell where the file goes in
a directory tree). The resulting files sometimes will run, sometimes not,
and often appear flaky. That EVERYTHING should be 128 bytes too long sounds
like a screwup, though...not a virus.

Does anyone know if Gatekeeper/Gatekeeper Aid will block this?  It
sounds like it will, but has anyone checked?

Hi everyone,

One IBM PC at my office gets infected by virus.  I used Virscan(tm)
from IBM and it detected some executable files *.EXE and *.COM are
infected by 1813 or Jerusalem virus.  Anybody knows any kind of
software which can fix the don't have to reformat hard drive.  Any
public domain or commercial software can do the job?  Any information
is highly appreciated.

Thanks,

With all due respect to Fridrik Skulason's very valuable data, he has
not seen Dr. Tippett's model, but only a brief conclusion about it
made by me.  While I think that Dr. Tippett will find Skulason's data
and analysis as interesting and useful as I do, I think that Skulason
will find the model not so naive as my brief observation might make it
appear.

To the extent that the biological analogy holds, it is clear that viruses are
self-limiting; they either kill off members of the host population or
make them immune.  However, this is one of the places that the analogy
fails us.  There is not auto-immune response to viruses; they must be
treated.  Second, treatment may not necessarily remove the machine from
the target population.

To return to the biological analogy, it clearly demonstrates that YOU CANNOT
STOP THE SPREAD BY TREATING THE SYMPTOMS OF THE INFECTED.

Contrary to the impression given here, the virus is NEVER eradicated
completely.  All infected machines in a sub-population may be purged,
but the virus persists on the media vector and in other populations.

The point is that waiting until the virus appears to immunize the
population is too late.  We are and have been doing that.  It is part
of the observed doubling time.

    I think when a discusion of a virus and how to deal with a virus
is talked about it is a good iead to take a look at the first disease
that man has been able to eliminate totaly.  That is the Small Pox
virus.  How small pox was eliminated is fairly simple.  Frist the
conditions that led to small pox were eliminated then individual cases
were delt with and treated so they could not spread.
  So I think a simular method should be used in dealing with a
computer virus.  I would recomend a issue of National Geographic that
talked about Small Pox.  I belive the issue is from 1978 some time
but. . . .
                    Any replies or alternate thoughts are welcome

Subject: ZUC & SAM 2.0 (MAC)

For SAM 2.0 users:

A new virus has recently been discovered (now named ZUC). If you happen to run
across the ZUC with SAM 2.0, you can expect to see the following.

1) If you are running in standard, advanced, or custom levels, SAM will alert
you to ZUC's attempt to change CODE resources within applications when ZUC is
trying to spread itself. Denying this attempt with SAM keeps the infection from
spreading.

2) If you have previously inoculated your applications with Virus Clinic 2.0,
then if ZUC has infected any files since inoculation (if, for instance, you had
SAM Intercept turned off or set to basic level), then SAM will alert you to an
inoculation discrepancy when you try to launch the infected file.

3) SAM Virus Clinic will also alert you to a checksum change to any infected
files if you have turned on checksumming in the Virus Clinic scans.

4) You can configure SAM (both Virus Clinic and Intercept) to find ZUC during
scans and application launches with the new virus definition feature. Using the
Add Virus Definition option in Virus Clinic, create a new one with these
fields:

     Virus Name:   ZUC
  Resource Type:   CODE
    Resource ID:   1
  Resource Size:   Any
  Search String:   4E56FF74A03641FA04D25290    (hexadecimal)
  String Offset:   Any

You can then add this definition to both Virus Clinic and SAM Intercept.

One other note: SAM 2.0 also repairs files infected with multiple viruses!
