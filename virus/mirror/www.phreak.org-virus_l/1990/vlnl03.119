VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
LEHIIBM1.BITNET for BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

The following files have been placed on MIBSRV.MIB.ENG.UA.EDU (130.160.20.80)
in the directory pub/ibm-antivirus for anonymous FTPing.

Uploaded on June 29, 1990.

0validate.crc    -  McAfee's listing of validation strings for various programs
scanv64.zip      -  McAfee's SCAN V64

netscn64.zip     -  McAfee's Scan for Networks V64
cleanp64.zip     -  McAfee's CleanUp V64

The earlier version of these programs (V63) will remain on MIBSRV until
July 5, 1990 for possible requests queued at BITFTP@PUCC.

Someone on the list made a comment concerning F-Prot v111.  Is this program
actually out?  The latest version I'm aware of is F-Prot v110.

at Cal State Chico, we have experienced some conflict between Microsoft
Mail and other inits, etc in the system folder.
If you can eliminate the problem by moving the startup screen,
the problem is probably a conflict between the startup screen loader
and some other init or system file.

Try taking the inits you have out of the system folder one at a time
and rebooting...this will help ypu narrow down the culprit.

Sometimes newer versions of inits solve conflict problems with
other popular DAs and inits.

Subject: Alex's SAM reports... (Mac)

With regard to Alex Zavatone's questions about SAM and WDEF, I would like to
report the following.

The WDEF in question was not a virus, but the standard system WDEF in a desktop
file. SAM reports this not as a WDEF infection, but rather as a code resource
of type WDEF in the desktop file, which might be an infection. There is no
cause for alarm in this instance.

Subject: Info needed: virus protection for OS/2

I have been asked by someone who has a large number of PS/2s running
OS/2 what steps they can take to protect against viruses. Looking back
through the VIRUS-L archives I can't see much specifically on OS/2.
Other than all the usual steps (ban unauthorised software (sure!), take
frequent backups, lock the master disks away, etc.), what else is
normally done?
(Admission: I am a Macintosh user, new to OS/2, so know little about them
to date...!)

Subject: 4096 virus frequencies? (PC)

Does anyone have a strong feeling (or even hard evidence!) for
how widespread the 4096 virus is?   We have seen very few
first-hand reports, but there are rumors, from the direction
of Israel in particular, that it is beginning to become a
significant problem in some places.  Does anyone know any
more than I do on this subject?               DC

I have gotten conflicting answers on this, so I'll ask again...

My understanding is that VMS 4.3 was the version rated at C2, and that
rating did not automatically carry over to later versions of VMS.
Hence, if you are running 4.3 you have (potentially) a C2 system.  But
if you are running 4.4 through 5.4 you don't.

Can someone explain how these ratings apply when a system is upgraded ?

Emily H. Lonsford of Mitre writes:
"Is that what CA is telling you?  I just looked in my April 1990
'Information Systems Security Products and Services Catalog', a government
publication, and CA is not in the list of vendors in the evaluation
process."

Her question relates to my comment that Computer Associates is "in the
process" of raising the rating of ACF2 and Top Secret from C2 to B1, which
will make hacking more difficult.

What CA is telling all of us is in the form of product announcements for
CA-ACF2 and CA-Top Secret.  I have the ones for the MVS versions of these
products.  There probably are also announcements for the VM versions, but
I haven't seen them.  The announcements are dated February 15, 1990, but I
just got them in the mail recently.  The announcements are almost
identical to each other, so I will quote parts of the CA-ACF2 MVS text:

     "CA-ACF2 MVS Release 5.2 PTFs permit security operation following the
Department of Defense Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (DOD
5200.28-STD) for a Mandatory Access Control (MAC) security system at the
B1 level."

     "Available 3rd Quarter 1990 - Beta Test"

     "In August 1989, CA filed proposals with the NCSC to have CA-ACF2
MVS, CA-ACF2 VM, CA-TOP SECRET MVS and CA-TOP SECRET VM formally evaluated
to ensure full compliance with the Department of Defense Trusted Computer
Systems Evaluation Criteria (DOD5200.28-STD) at a B1 level. Although CA
cannot guarantee that CA-ACF2 MVS will receive a B1 rating nor is it
possible for CA to provide a specific date for when a formal evaluation
will be completed, CA has worked successfully with the NCSC on numerous
occasions and completed several evaluations."

That's what they're saying.  Evaluate it for yourself.  Personally, I will
believe it when I see it.  The announcement is sort of like telling people 's p
oint about the rating's not applying to an individual site's
implementation is well taken.  The rating is for the PRODUCT, not for your
installation.  For instance, if you give security privileges to large
numbers of people, you couldn't expect to call your installation "secure"
even if the product has a B1 rating.  And who knows what your system
modifications might do?

Emily writes about the first copy of ACF2 being written at London Life in
Ontario.  I can add that copy #2 went to Linda Vetter's installation at
GM; Linda was one of the chair people of the security committee at SHARE,
and later became a Vice President at SKK.  Copy #3 came here, to GTE
Laboratories, in 1978.  It was installed personally by Barry Schraeger, Eb
Klemmons, and Scott Kruger, the original "SKK."  Several releases, and
years, later, I was having some difficulty getting an answer to a
technical question from SKK Tech Support.  By then, they had a "Level 1"
and "Level 2" structure which was getting in the way.  Finally, in
frustration, I said "Look, this product was installed on our system by
Barry, Scott, and Eb.  Now it doesn't work, and it's impacting our
business.  I want the installers back out here on site."  We got INSTANT
attention.

Since we deinstalled the IBM systems last December, we probably have the
distinction of being the longest running ACF2 site to remove the product,
too.

I expect lively discussion at the CA Security and Audit conference in
Orlando this coming week.  Unfortunately for me, the session concerning
new features is scheduled opposite one I will be giving (on granting
privileges to systems programmers!).

I thank Emily for her comments.  Those certainly were interesting times.

AT&T has a product called "System V/MLS" (Multi-Level Security), which
they released in 1989.  Reading from the product announcement, I see that
System V/MLS was certified at the B1 security level by the NCSC.  It is
configurable at C1, C2, and B1 levels.  System V/MLS is available (at least
at initial release) for the 3B2/500 and 3B2/600 computers; I'd be surprised
if AT&T hasn't ported it further up the product line.  There is also a
windowing terminal that maintains a B3 trusted path to the security kernel.
They also have a suite of trusted RFC networking utilities.

After reading the Orange Book, I'm reasonably sure that AT&T has achieved
the "separation of duties" to which Emily refers.

I haven't used this product, nor have I read any reviews; I just know
what I read in the literature.
