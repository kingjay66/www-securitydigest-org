I have seen this on a number of machines (Compaq particularly) that
reserve 1k of top memory for drivers/etc (Compaq claims it is for its
mouse & can be recovered by moving a jumper on the mother board).
There are a couple of viruses that use this same technique in software
(Brain, Yale) but the reserved area is usually larger than 1k and it
contains executable code. The conflict comes about because some memory
checkers use Int 21 Fn 48 to determine free memory, others use Int 12,
while some just look at 0:413 & 414 for the number of reported
segments. These may report differently. The best tool I have seen for
checking is Quarterdeck's MANIFEST though it can be confused
sometimes. The freeware (?) program MAPMEM by Turbopower Software when
used with the /V (verbose) option is also very good.

Subject: Interesting note on Dark Avenger (PC)

Recently, a professor bought a 386 machine to do CAD on.  All the
files on her old machine (true blue PC w/tiny turbo 286) were to be
copied off, so I got a copy of FASTWIRE and proceeded to hook a cable
to both parallel ports in order to transfer the data.

Fastwire uses a split-screen mode: one screen for local, one for remote.
Imagine my shock when, after transfering an EXE file, the local screen showed
the file to be 55K in size, while the remote machine showed it to be 53K!
During the transfer (which I did 4 times), it showed 55K transfered, but
the remote screen always showed 53K.  I then scanned the machine with
SCAN V62 (quickest copy available) and found DAV all over her old PC (which
we then cleaned up).  DAV also causes the following error message to be
displayed when trying to transfer a file via FASTWIRE:

        ERROR:  File or directory not found.  Hit ESC to continue.

I was just wondering how FASTWIRE could show the file size changes in its
split-screen mode.

Subject: HP DeskJet freezes with Zenith XT--Virus? (PC)

Hello:

I'm posting this on behalf of a friend who doesn't have network access.
In the main campus library here at UCR, there are several Zenith XT's (as
well as other assorted IBM clones) each of which has a HP DeskJet printer.
Each also has a CD-ROM, containing a database of reference information.

The problem (only seen so far on the Zeniths) is as follows:  On occasion,
(about once per month per machine), the Zenith will no longer be able to
print to its printer.  The cursor scans the screen during a PrtScn, but
nothing goes out to the printer.  The only way found to fix this is to
physically remove the printer, plug it into one of the other clones, print
something to it, and then plug it back into its original machine.

This has apparently been happening for about four months, and the workaround
clears it up, but I wonder why it happens!  Could this be a virus?

Oh, by the way, after the machine won't print anymore, switching another
working printer to the non-printing machine doesn't work.  What it DOES do
is make it so that the second printer won't print either!

The Zeniths have MS-DOS version 3.21; I couldn't check the DOS version for
the other clones, as they have no access to a DOS prompt from those machines.
I used the SCAN program to look on the Zeniths for a virus and found none.

Any help or pointers would be greatly appreciated.  I've posted this to
Info-IBMPC, just in case this is not a virus.  Please respond directly to me,
and I'll summarize whatever I hear to the list in a short while.  Thanks
again!

Subject: re: Troubles with CLEAN (general remark)

Hello folks,

the adventures of Martin Zejma are a vivid example of the shortcomings
dis-infector programs inevitably tend to exhibit.  I think I have
expressed my views towards these programs before, but now the time has
come to re-phrase them.

What does a dis-infector? It is not so important to remove the viral
code from the program file, rather the invokation of this code must be
suppressed. This code is usually invoked by a JMP-instruction right
at the program start: This instruction will have to be replaced with
the original content of the respective bytes. (In the general case,
the virus will have replaced some part of the original program with part
of its own code, at least with one JMP- or CALL-instruction; and this
changed code will have to be restored by the dis-infector.)

Luckilly, the dis-infector will find the information to restore the
original content of the changed locations somewhere in the viral code,
as the virus will restore the original program in the main-storage
before it will invoke it to hide the virus' existence from the user.

Now, if the dis-infector hits on a hitherto unknown variant of the
virus, it may take the wrong bytes from the viral code, put them in
place of the sayed JMP- or CALL-instruction, and in due course it will
destroy the program instead of repairing it.

I conjecture that the Vienna variant of the 1704 is unknown to McAfee
and his team, and hence this sort of thing happened.
Martin Zejma: I think it would be a good idea to send a copy of the
virus you experienced to McAfee Asociates (and also to Frisk).

But even this will not mend the basic problem| Next week (month, or
year), some kind soul will send a new 1704-variant (or whatever-variant)
on its way that will fool the dis-infectors again :-(

Best wishes

Is this figure accurate?

I think that EXE files can only grow by multiples of 16.
Am I mistaken?

Maybe; it's certainly a technique that a virus could use.  However,
there's another possibility: on certain PS/2's, such as my 50, there
is a hardware error which causes the system clock to do bizarre
things.  The fix is a device driver with some peculiar name which, as
on your system, makes it look as if you have only 639K of DOS memory.
Check your config.sys for this device driver; I think it's called
dasddrvr.sys or something.

A friend of mine who does graphic design mentioned that she had heard
of a new Mac virus that changed the password on LaserWriters to some
other value. Has anyone else heard any information about this virus -
how it propogates, if GateKeeper catches it, etc?

Subject: frankie & flipper (mac)

    Recently, there have been mention of 2 new mac viruses, namely
Frankie and Flipper.  Frankie is at least slightly documented in
Disinfectant 2.0.  And since I don't plan on buying an atari to
emulate a mac, I think I'm safe.  However, someone mentioned awakening
the "flipper" virus from the info-mac arch.  I have no clues on this
one and would welcome getting some.  Soo if anyone has any info on
flipper please send to the list or to me at

Subject: We've been hit!!! Help! (4096 VIRUS) (PC)

     This afternoon we discovered that two of the machines in our lab have
    the 4096 virus on them.  One of the people in our office was installing
    new software on the hardrives of the lab machines.  The machines are
    protected with disk manager.  The install was going fine until she
    reached one certain machine.  When she tried booting off her disk
    manager disk, it started the booting process then wouldn't read the
    disk.  When she tried booting without the bootdisk it came back with
    "Insert system disk into drive and press any key to continue".  The
    machine will no longer work.   This happened with two machines.  When
    she tried to check the her disk on a machine in the consulting office
    it ruined that one.  At that point I ran SCANV62 on the disks she
    had been using that day and sure enough every executable file has
    4096 on it.  We think that since the disk she was using was just created
    on a clean machine (we assume) that she picked it up on a lab machine.
    Either way we now have three machines that no longer boot up.

     I've created a fresh, clean boot disk and tried booting up with it.
    All three get to the A prompt but only one will recognize the C: drive.
    On that one, every .exe or .com file was infected.

     Does anybody have any info on what we can do?  How can we get these
    machines working again and how can we get rid of this virus?  What's
    the best way to handle this.  Can anybody give me any info on this
    virus?  Does it normally cause the machine to no longer boot?  Any
    help would be greatly appreciated.  How come diskmanager didn't
    stop this virus?  I don't know disk manager that well!

			Thank you for any assistance.

I reported the first DOCUMENTED sighting of this virus in the U.S.
because a retail computer dealer... James Rich of James Rich Computers
in Corsicana TX... was willing to stand up and admit to having the
infection in an effort to slow its spread in the Dallas area.

Prior to my posting, no-one has reported this virus' appearance in the
U.S. on Virus-L, and the emergence of this virus in the U.S. IS a
significant event that needs attention.

What is of PRIME IMPORTANCE is that all of us in the virus research
community know when we've got a new problem to deal with, and one of
the reasons for Virus-L's existance is to provide a vehicle for this
type of information.

As recently as July 2nd, Dave Chess from IBM asked if anyone had any
reports on the 4k virus since he'd been hearing rumors about its
spread, especially in Israel.

A response from Y. Radai stated that the 4k has been creating problems
in Israel for about a year.

John McAfee offered no response to the query from Dave Chess.

And now he tells us:

    >    The 4096 was first detected at Washington University
    > in St. Louis nearly 6 months ago and since then has been reported
    > at over 100 sites involving many thousands of computers.

    > diskette), 13 Burger King franchises in Scotts Valley, CA and Santa
    > Cruz, numerous IRS offices in Seattle and one of the nation's
    > largest banks based in Houston.

I have spoken with several people at the Northern California Burger
King Corporate group that supports franchises. They were not aware of
any virus problem at the franchise sites in their area. For a final
resolution on this, I am awaiting a return call from the Operational
V. P. in that office.

I also spoke with Mr. Tim Thompson of the "End User Support Group" at
the IRS in Seattle. Mr. Thompson was unaware of ANY virus problems at
the IRS offices other than some Mac viruses last year and his own
personal experience with the Disk Killer virus several months ago,
which he eliminated before it spread to other systems. By the way, it
seems the IRS has ONE office in Seattle.

What gives here ?????


Ray Glath

ps: According to a recent conversation with my colleagues in Europe,
the 4k virus has been causing problems in the U.K.  for about the last
2 months...

pps: This is a heavily revised posting. Ken van Wyk censored my
original response, which has been sent to John McAfee as private mail.

[Ed. Ray asked me to check for the record - a quick grep through the
v-l archives turned up one previous report of a 4096 infection, at
Weizmann Univ. in Israel.]
