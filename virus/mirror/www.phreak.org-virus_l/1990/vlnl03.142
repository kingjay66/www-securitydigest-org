Subject: Bear virus? (Mac)

Has anyone heard about a (potentially) new virus called the "Bear"
virus? I indirectly saw a posting about this virus on Prodigy, in the
Mac Software area, which is supposed to "trash hard drives". The
person who posted the message said that the only solution was to
reformat the drive. He didn't actually isolate the virus, he just saw
its effects.

At this point, this should be treated as an unconfirmed rumor. Can
anyone shed some light?

This indicates that there is a very strong chance that no virus exists on

If you don't give FLU_SHOT+ the correct checksums when you install it,
you will get these errors.  As a matter of fact, this is how you first
determine what the correct checksums are.

Now that FLUSHOT+ is running TSR in your system, it will report any
TSR requests that are unregistered.  It seems that you have not
registered SCANRES, so when you tried to run it, you got this error.

I hope this helps,

Thanks to Y. Radai for posting a response to my query.  For those who
might want to know what other responses I got, here they are, with

	It is great.  Cheap, SIMPLE, and contains tips on how to guard
against viruses.  It can be used to check memory, hard disks, floppies,
and it can be set up as a memory resident watchdog.  It has
documentation on the symptoms of several hundred viruses.
	The cost is $15.00 or $1.00/computer for 15-500 computers and
$2.00 above that.  The author is Fridrik Skulason at frisk@rhi.hi.is
or BOX 7180, IS-127 Reykjavik, Iceland.
	As opposed to Mcafee's SCAN; I have been a member of virus-L
for over 2 months and have seen a few complaints about SCAN but none
about FPROT.
	You can certainly afford to invest $15.00 to see whether my
enthusiasm is merited.	P.

Hello,
I experienced the FPROT package.  I found it to be good in removing
but a bit slow when searching for viruses in memory.
If you don't care for speed use it.  It's a very good package.

Yes, I have tested F-PROT versions 1.07-1.12 and found them excellent.
I've been in contact with Petteri Jarvinen, a well-known (in Finland:-)
guy who has somewhat more experience of viruses, and he has told me
that F-PROT *is* good.

>From ...@OBERLIN.EDU	Mon Aug  6 15:43:11 1990

We've decided to use F-PROT here at Oberlin College; we've now "bought"
enough licenses to have some of my colleagues guinea-pig it.  (I have
been the only tester here so far, and my other job duties leave me far
too little time to test any program adequately).

The reasons we've chosen F-PROT are these:
1) It seems to have the best price-performance ratio.
   (We can't afford SCAN!)
2) Frisk seems to update it with sufficient frequency.
3) Based on his contributions to VIRUS-L, Frisk seems
   to "know his stuff."

I haven't taken a look at version 1.12 yet.  One problem with versions
1.11 and earlier is that they are not effortless to install.  My hope
is to work up some sort of batch procedure which will simplify the
installation.

Subject: 4096/JOSHI/etc./ZENITH update (PC)

	In my limited looks at viruses, I have noticed that those that
go "resident" do so in a number of obvious ways. Those that do not (I
believe the ICELANDIC was one) do not seem to spread very well since
they chance being overwritten with a resultant crash. After 50 or 60
times most people tend to suspect something.

	My question is, does anyone know of any legitemate software
that moves the TOM or changes the size of allocation available such as
reported by CHKDSK ? I know of a few systems that start out with some
memory allocated at the TOM (Compaq is one) but none that change after
the BIOS start-up.  Since Microsoft-compliant TSRs reside in low
memory, these should not do anything up top.

	A call was received from Zenith today confirming that XT-type
machines running Zenith's version of DOS 3.1 & 3.2 do periodically
place a timestamp on the boot record of the hard drive. Generally the
boot record will contain the signature ZDS3.x (where x is 1 or 2)
though since Norton's Disk Doctor became available, I have seen some
strange combinations. On the machines I have examined, if they boot
without an AUTOEXEC.BAT present, a Zenith logo will be displayed
following the time/date request.

	In any event, a good virus checker that validates the boot
record will probably flag this as an exception each time it checks.

				Good luck,

Subject: SCAN 66 Validation Issues (PC)

This is a forward from John McAfee:
================================================================

	Professor Timo Salmi was quite right in his criticism of the
new "Validate" feature of SCAN that he posted in yesterday's Virus-L.
I must apologize for the inconvenience caused by the bug in SCAN's
validation code removal processing.  It has been fixed and Version
66-B has been released.
	Mr. Salmi is also correct in stating that the validation
feature will cause programs that do a self-CRC check to mistakenly
false alarm.   This issue was carefully considered prior to
implementing the validate feature and we hope we have placed
sufficient flexibility in choosing target files (and removing
validation codes) to bypass most problems that might occur.  We
felt that there was a sufficiently large number of existing
programs that did not do a self-check, and that these programs
would benefit from SCAN's validation processing.  With 66-B, the
code removal is as simple as the code application, so programs that
do currently perform a self-check can be returned to their original
state, or, alternately, they can be skipped over when the code is
originally applied.
	As to Mr. Salmi's concern that the code application seemed too
much like "patching" the program, I must in good humor disagree.
The validation code in no way modifies the internal logic of the
program.  It is merely an appendage.
	For those who disfavor this approach, we will still support
SENTRY and continue its distribution.  SENTRY performs a similar
validation, only instead of attaching the codes directly to the
validated programs, it maintains a separate log file for its
comparisions.  The advantage of the SCAN approach, however, is that
it is system independent.  The validation code travels with the
program as it is passed around.  A further advantage of the SCAN
approach is that the next version of VSHIELD (V67) will disallow
any program from executing if the program contains a validate code
which is incorrect.  This will help prevent unknown viruses from
getting into your system at all.

CVIA Membership Alert
Originating Members:  [Information Removed]
Alert Type:  Initial Infection Spread
Library Entries:  Mardi Bros., Joshi, Plastique, Leprosy, AirCop
Entry Types:  Boot infectors, File Infector

	The first East Coast report of the Mardi Bros. virus was
received August 13 from Lakewood, New Jersey.  Reports of this boot
sector virus have previously been confined to Asia, the Pacific
Rim, and the Western U.S.  Its spread has been slow (relative to
Joshi, 4096 and similar rapidly spreading viruses), and limited
damage has been reported from infected sites.
	Joshi was discovered in Hawaii on August 10, the first report
from Hawaii.  Joshi continues to generate multiple daily infection
reports from scattered parts of the U.S.
	The Plastique virus has been verified in Australia as of
August 9.  A sample submitted by the New South Wales Computer Virus
Clinic was reported to have heavilly infected businesses and PC
users in Bankstown.  The sample was identical to the original
Plastique first reported in Taiwan on May 31.   The virus is
extremely destructive.
	Sporadic reports of Leprosy and AirCop continue to creep in
from Northern California, Oregon, and Washington.  It is still
deemed unlikely that Leprosy will develop into a substantial
threat, and AirCop is easily identified and disinfected.

I never proposed this - what I said was simply "viruses that attempt to hide
from detection, using a variety of methods".  The methods may include:

	Disinfecting the file when it is read (4096 method)

	Redirecting INT 13H and/or INT 21H, so the file will appear to be
	unchanged when read.

	Redirecting INT 13, so the boot sector appears unchanged, while the
	virus is active in memory (Brain)

	and possibly the method used by TPVIR and AIDS II, where the original
	program does not change, and the user is unaware that he is, in fact,
	executing the virus instead of the program he intends to execute.

>Stealth - (adj) Any malicious code that "hides" from detection by

"erasing itself" is not 100% clear, I think.  What about:

Stealth: Any malicious code that vanishes or appears to vanish from the
infected media, while it is active in memory.

No - it is not, for numerous reasons - one is that the
anti-virus-viruses may not be able to properly identify new variants
of a virus they know, and destroy the infected program, instead of
disinfecting it.  There are also numerous other reasons.

If you provide anyone with a virus, even a "harmless" one - the risk
arises that somebody might create a new, harmful virus, just by
patching the "harmless" one.

	Jim Powlesland writes concerning the price of the McAfee utilities:
>>It's my impression that this resentment is
>>very real and much of it comes from the fact that users can get
>>relatively the samelevel of protection on their Macintoshes (ie.
>>Disinfectant and GateKeeper) FREE OF CHARGE.

	The last time I looked, there were eight MAC viruses with
several substrains. To use Patricia Hoffman's classification, three
are common (nVir, Scores, & WDEF), three are rare, and two are
extinct. In contrast the un-zipped VSUM9008 is over 300k long, lists
138 distinct viruses, 19 of which are considered "common":
  4096, Ashar, Brain, Cascade, Cascade-B, Dark Avenger, Den Zuk Disk Killer,
  Jerusalem, Jerusalem B, Joshi, Korea, Microbes, Murphy, Ohio, Ping Pong-B,
  Stoned, Sunday, & Yankee Doodle.

	For that matter, given the widespread "shareware" distribution
of SCAN, CLEAN, & even NETSCAN, I suspect that there are far more
unpaid copies of these utilities than any of the MAC products.
Therefore, I suspect that we have two levels of uses: the individual
who is free to choose whether or not to pay a nominal fee for the
product, and the corporate/educational user who must choose how to
budget his/her funds.

	Again, no one is being forced to use any product. People are
free to choose what level of protection/detection they want and to
take the time and trouble to create their own protection if they so
desire. To castigate someone for having the effrontery to charge for
providing a service, particularly someone who allows the market to
choose whether or not to pay and who is consumed with an incredible
number of updates, smacks of the worst aspects of socialism (personal
opinion).

	On the CRC subject. My feeling is that the signatures should
be maintained as a separate file rather than tacked onto the program,
however the user is free to choose whether or not to use it. To say
that Mr. McAfee might be liable for copyright infringement would imply
that IBM is also for providing DEBUG. SCAN provides a tool, it is the
users responsibility to determine what to do with it (caveat: I am not
a lawyer nor do I have any desire to be). In any event, the /AV switch
is no more dangerous than the /D.

	It does indicate that Mr. McAfee is concerned about the
limitations of SCAN and is trying to find a better solution. He is on
the right track, and if he must use a publicly-known algorithm for the
CRC, the dual method used by VALIDATE is better than most (I prefer a
simple machine-unique one for internal validation and a different and
more rigorous one for public transmittal).
