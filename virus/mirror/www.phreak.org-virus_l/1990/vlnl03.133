Subject: Diskettes w/o DOS Executable Files (PC)

Steve Albrecht <70033.1271@CompuServe.COM> asks if a diskette with no
*.EXE, *.COM, *.SYS or *.BAT files can spread a virus infection in any
way except by having a boot-sector virus and being booted from, having
an executable file that is present under another name and is later
renamed and run, or having a virus in a word-processor or spreadsheet
macro.

There are a few other ways that those categories may or may not cover.
If the diskette is infected with a boot-sector virus, but does not
contain a copy of the operating system, booting the machine with that
diskette in the drive can infect the system, even though the computer
"does not boot" (the "non-system disk or disk error" message appears).
If the diskette contains any files that any program treats as code,
they may be infected; this includes EXE, COM, BAT, and SYS files and
application macros, but also *.BAS files (interpreted by a BASIC
interpreter), files intended for interpretation by REXX or LISP
interpreters, and so on, and even (although we don't know of any such
viruses at the moment) source code (*.PAS, *.C, etc).  It also
includes any overlays or auxiliary-code files which some other program
will load via the DOS load/execute function; these are sometimes named
*.OVL, but they may be called anything at all.  The 1813 virus, for
instance, will infect such files, and we have seen 1813-infected files
with extensions of "DAT" and "BIN" and "BSP".

  Basically, there are all -sorts- of things that are "executable"
enough that a virus could be written to spread between them, and are
therefore probably worth protecting in critical applications.  DC

Subject: Netserver/Checksums/Stoned (PC)

	On the Netserver issue: it would seem that we are missing one
important distinction: is the server itself becoming infected or is
it files stored on the server ? I have seen files on a server become
infected (Sunday) but not the server itself (of course, being a VAX
it would have been very difficult). We need a more explicit
description of the experiment to be able to determine risk, particularly
having seen several instances where privileged operation resulted in
an infection that could not have been spread by other means.

	Generally, write permission is something that is either granted or
not, and while spoofing & hole exploitation are means of getting around this,
I have not yet seen a PC virus that attempts it.

	On CheckSumming: in order to know the algorithm in place (assuming
it is more than a trivial summation), the detection/authentication package
in use must be determined. Given knowlege of the package, it is far easier
to subvert the package itself (always pass) than to try to match its checksums.
This is the same reason that mainframe viruses are rare: it is easier to
accomplish the same ends using a worm rather than a virus.

	ANY protection package can be subverted given enough knowlege and
effort. Luckily a virus must operate under certain constraints as to size
and complexity. The most devious MS-DOS virus currently requires a 4k addition
to files to operate and becomes evident through its size though it is often
lost in hard disk quantum space. Even so, it still attempts to hide from
detection packages rather than to subvert them.

	The key is that many detection packages still rely on mutable MS-DOS
interrupts for operation while the current crop of viruses have progressed
spoofing BIOS interrupts and using DMA & direct I/O to bypass/subvert MS-DOS
entirely. An effective detection package must use or at least be able to
detect changes in these to be effective. For the last few years, the relatively
easily detected viruses have been handleable by equally simple responses
(my statement that ALL of the common viruses with the possible exception of
the 4096 can be detected by examining just three bytes still goes). Now we
are reaching the point where more sophisticated schemes are going to be
necessary. Developments such as shadow ROM, multi-tasking software, and CMOS
setups provide vulnerabilities that are not currently being covered.

	Enough philosophy. Concerning the STONED virus, a full low level
repartitioning and reformat of a hard disk is not really necessary for
recovery. Since the virus stores the original partition table (I believe it
is in physical sector 7), someone who knows what they are doing can recover
through restoration of sector 0. With only slightly more difficulty, if the
original partition sizes and bad block table is known, a good technician can
restore the partition table from scratch. The code is not particlularly
complex and the table itself is well documented. While it is not something
I would choose for a Saturday afternoon, it can be done. Of course if a full
backup is available, re-partitioning/re-formatting/reloading is a mindless
exercise. My point is just that if irreplaceable data is on the disk, it may
recovered.

	As an exercise for the student, it should take not more than an hour
using DEBUG to write a routine that will save the partition table,
boot sector, both FATs, and the root directory to a floppy and allow selective
restoration of any part thereof.

   We will be developing 2 new Macintosh public computer clusters this Fall
at IUPUI (University of Indiana - Purdue University at Indianapolis).  The
MACs will be SE 30s with harddrives and will run off an IBM Mod 80 server
which will connect the MACs to Mainframes and in turn connect any MAC to any
other micro computer on our campus.
   Does any other school/organization represented on this list have a similar
configuration?  If so, what virus checking routines do you use?  Is There a MAC
network specific virus checker?  Thanks

Interesting!  What have you seen the 4096 do to the boot sector?  The
only boot-sector effect that I know of so far is that some of the
broken/garbled/not_working code seems to be designed to write the
"Frodo Lives!" display program to (some) boot sector.  But I've never
seen a 4096 sample in which enough of that code was intact to even
figure out just what it was supposed to do.  Any more information you
have would be very nice!

> 3. All executables and coms get infected, my suspision is that a file checker

Yep; if the virus is active in memory, executables get infected when
they are opened/closed.  Since virus checkers open/close just about
all executables, running a checker that does not scan memory for
4096-like viruses before scanning files can cause the infection to
spread in a hurry.  It's best to scan only after cold booting from a
known-clean floppy (so you know the virus isn't in memory), with a
known-clean scanner.  That's not always feasible, of course...

In Virus-L v3 #123, Steve Albrecht details his company's method
of removing the Stoned virus in an effort to help Yavuz...

Steve,
   While your method will certainly remove the stoned virus from a
hard-disk, it seems to me to be like hunting squirrels with a
bazooka. We had a rampant infection of Stoned here, and it was
easily removed by McAfee's CleanUp. No data loss, no need to have
a current backup (though you should always have one!), no problems.

Yavuz,
   Just boot the infected machine from a clean, write protected
diskette. Once it is up and running from the diskette, you can
run CleanUp and reboot (from the hard drive). The whole procedure
takes about two minutes. Of course, you should also run scan
and CleanUp on all of your floppies to prevent re-infection.

(a) You need *some* executable code to get it up the first time.

(b) There is no theoretical reason you can't put a virus in source code.
    I first brought this point up in a "hoax" posting a few weeks before
    the Internet Worm showed up (and when lots of people were saying that
    you couldn't do a UNIX virus). It's been reposted on virus-l, and I'm
    sure it's in the archives.

[Lots of very useful information removed]

Janet's point was that the program that actually sent the PostScript
to the printer was a Macintosh trojan horse, so that the PostScript
would be downloaded only from a Macintosh.  (At least I think that's
what she meant.  Since we share an office, I suppose I could ask her
:-).  Granted, once the PostScript is actually in the printer, it's
a problem for any computer (Mac, IBM, UNIX box) that wants to contact
the printer.  But that actual trojan horse itself is a Macintosh
application, so other systems wouldn't be able to spread the infection
(unless the author has been kind enough to provide the trojan on
multiple systems, which of course is entirely possible).

Sigh.  I love irresponsible hackers.  Really, I do.  Heavens, what
would I do with my time if I couldn't spend it fighting viruses?

If you're going to use the Norton Advanced Utilities you may as well remove
the Stoned virus while you're there.

Hard Disk Infection:
        - copy Side 0 Cylinder 0 Sector 7 to Side 0 Cylinder 0 Sector 1.
        - 007 is where your original partition table has been moved.

Floppy Diskette Infection:
        - copy Side 1 Cylinder 0 Sector 3 to Side 0 Cylinder 0 Sector 1.
        - 103 is where your original boot sector has been moved.

This may not work for all variations of the Stoned virus but it probably will.

Good Luck.

Subject: Re: New mac virus? (Mac)

I've been doing general disk repairs and virus work around here, and
I've come across a problem with one of the disks.  Following standard
procedure, I bit-copied it onto another (blank) disk, and worked from
that disk.  As a result: My MacII bombed three times and the hard disk
started skipping like a bad record (This could be a problem with the
hard disk, and unrelated to viruses).  The disturbing part is the copy
which I was working on.  Although it has been scanned by Disinfectant
2.0, Virex Init v. 1.7, SAM virus clinic, and Virex 2.7.1, none of
them has detected either viruses or trojan horses or any sort of foul
play.  The catcher is this: although the disk is physically unlocked,
it is marked "locked" under the info box, and cannot be modified or
unlocked.  So far, the only program which has made a difference has
been Mactools, which registered the disk as unlocked.  I'm going to
work on it from there, but I would greatly appreciate any comments or
suggestions.

Thanks.

	John McAfee has authorized me to begin posting selected CVIA
Membership Alerts to VIRUS-L/VALERT-L.  Ken van Wyk has asked John if
he would provide more information to VIRUS-L subscribers about
infection occurences by new virus strains.  Membership Alerts appear
to be the best way to do this.  All Alerts will be posted to Virus-l
provided the report originator does not specify membership restricted

July 27, 1990
CVIA Membership Alert
Originating Member: Microsoft Corporation
Alert Type: New Virus in Public Domain
Library Entry: AIRCOP
Entry Type: Boot Sector Virus

	CVIA member Microsoft Corporation has reported a public domain
U.S. infection by a new boot sector virus.  The virus has been
submitted to the library and is currently under analysis.  The
virus replicates in the normal boot sector fashion by booting from
an infected floppy.  Non-write-protected diskettes that are
inserted into an infected system become infected at the time that
the diskette is first referenced.
	The virus randomly displays the following message:

		Red State, Germ Offensive.
		AIRCOP

	Potential data damage has not yet been determined.  Early
analysis, however, indicates some small similarity to both the

WRONG!!!!  DON'T do this!!  It is unecessarily complicated/roundabout/
unnecessary.  The following is what worked for me to disinfect several
harddrives and floppys that were infected with the Stoned virus (and
some with Jerusalem B):

1.  Make backups.  The ones I worked on has a complete set up stored
on a server, and data files were the users responsibility (made it easier).
I like the idea of using Fastback, like Steve mentions.  I'd only back up
data files, though, and use the original, write protected floppys to put
the programs back on.

2.  Get SCAN.EXE from an ftp site or get it from McAfee's BBS.  (ftp
is probably the better choice, hey?)  I think that mibsrv.mib.eng.ua.edu
and rascal.ics.utexas.edu (134.82.1.1) have the latest version (SCANV64.ZIP,
I think).  Also get CLEAN.EXE (archived as (I think) CLEANV64.ZIP).
Download it to a clean machine (Boot from a clean, write protected system disk,
and don't use any executables off the hard drive, only off an original
write prote....)  At worst, the SCAN program would get infected, but would
probably still work.  Read the documentation.

3.  Read the manual.  Use SCAN.

4.  Boot from a clean write protected floppy, and use CLEAN.EXE to clean
up the infection. (of course, read the manual for it!)

4.5  There are other products out there, I just know and respect SCAN.
Check out the ftp site's archives, and get what looks good.  Have backups,
and read the manual!

5.  The way I heard it, sometimes ya lose it.  On floppies, if there are
subdirectories, you end up with everything in the root dir.  If this happens,
go back and pretend your drive is brand new, and start fresh.  From low-level.

6.  I had NO NO NO trouble, and things worked fine after that.

7.  I have a buddy who prefers the FPROT set.  I don't know it, but whatever
works best for you.

8.  If you get saved money, (time, hair pulling), it might be worth it
to send in a shareware registration to whoever wrote the anti-virus product
you use.  (I still haven't, but I will, really!).

9.  Let me know what happens (especially when you SCAN'd, did you find
other viruses?).

10.  I have a clone of my own (always clean so far!!), in spite of the
.signature (I can't afford a Mac).

Subject: Re: Stoned Virus Clear (PC)

Dear Yavuz,

I had a similar case recently, and the method used to destroy the virus
in the partition table was as follows:

- - Boot the machine from a write protected, non infected system disk,
so that the virus does not become resident and infects the system
immediately after you removed it.

- - Find a PC of the same brand as the infected one, with the same
harddisk and the same partition of the harddisk.

- - Use Norton Utility (advanced edition) to make a copy of the
partition table of the non-infected harddisk (use absolute sector
0 0 1 write to file as described in the booklet that came with
your Norton utilities)

- - Again use the Norton utility to write this file on the infected
system to absolute sector 0 0 1.

- - if all went well, you should now have a clean harddisk and you can
continu to clean all infected diskettes, by copying them to clean
diskettes followed by a format.

Note: depending on your harddisk it might either be nessecary to
copy only the very first physical sector, or the whole first
track. You can find out by using the partition table editor to see
where the first logical sector starts.

If you have any questions, you can contact me at FJ_Mulder@pttrnl.nl

Just a thought: during the test, is a user with supervisor rights
active on the network?  It would be *theoretically* possible for code
to put the LAN adaptor into promiscuous mode (on adaptors which
support this) and listen for a supervisor login request going past.
Equipped with this information it could then masquerade as supervisor.
It *may* also be possible for it to achieve the same end without
gleaning the username/password, by recognising a privileged connection
and then forging whatever the server uses to identify that connection
(though there'd doubtless be problems here with MAC-level addressing).

Either of these approaches is unlikely in a compact virus, though.

Disclaimer: I know very little about Novell protocols.  *Don't* take
this as an authoritative statement that they're insecure.  Hopefully a
genuine guru will tell me why it can't be done this way.
