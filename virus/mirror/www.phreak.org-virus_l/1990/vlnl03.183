VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,

Joe is correct in his conclusion, though he reflects a common
misunderstanding about the Mac.  There is nothing in the Macintosh
operating system itself that precludes multiple system files on a
single disk. I have five on mine right now.  The Resource Manager
never gets confused, nor do any of the other O.S. or application
software facilities.  It's all very clear on the inside of the
machine.

What _is_ problematic about multiple system files is that it's
extremely difficult for the _human operators_ to keep track of which
is the "real" System file, without careful and deliberate management
procedures.  Some resources such as fonts, INITs, application
preferences, etc., therefore get thrown into the "wrong" system
folder, yielding a performance profile at variance from what the user
expects.

Therefore Joe is correct in recommending against multiple system
files.  I'd like to extend this warning by offering the following
procedures for managing the Macintosh System file.

1.  Always keep the System Folder in the lower-left corner of the boot
disk's desktop.  Just as maps normally put North at the top, it's useful
to have a convention, and the lower-left corner is both common among
other users and aesthetic to the eye.

2.  Never keep more than one System file on a single disk, unless there
is a strong and persuasive reason to do so.

3.  If there _is_ reason to keep multiple System files, every such file
should be kept in a separate folder which contains the complete set of
system files (i.e., Finder, System, print drivers, etc.) for that
version.  Each of these versions will be a separate operating
environment, so keep a separate copy of your favorite virus scanning
program (such as Disinfectant INIT, SAM, Virex, Rival, etc.) in each
folder.

4.  Each of these full system folders should be clearly labelled with
its distinguishing characteristics (e.g., "System 6.0.7", "System
6.0.4", "KanjiTalk System").  These system folders should all then be
placed into a single folder, which should be labelled "System Folder"
and kept in the lower-left corner.

5.  Use the shareware product Blesser (or equivalent) to switch
between systems.  Be deliberate about which system you use, and always
reboot after changing systems.

6.  Remember that you can always determine which system version is in
use by choosing "About the Finder..." from the Apple Menu when running
the Finder, or by observing which of the sub-folders within the System
Folder contains the Macintosh picture on its Icon.

7.  If you don't know what the Finder is, you shouldn't proceed beyond
step 2 above.   :-)

Happy computing,

Some time ago I wrote a .COM file to do this. 1100 bytes & took about
2 hours using MASM (I'm slow). You give it a file name & it generates
a checksum. You give it a filename & checksum and it checks the file.
Runs at about 50k/second on a 4.77 mhz machine. Generates an
errorlevel of 0 if passes and 1 if fails. Put it in a batch file & it
will check files (or itself) then run the executable. Write it
yourself and you can use your own seed/ algorithm. Use interrupt 21 fn
3d, 3e, 3f, & 4c. For speed, read in 2k chunks.

As an option, you could use fn 4B to launch the program if it verifies
& you gave it a signature (or be really cute and use Int 2E).

Good for things like the Jerusalem/Sunday but it will not detect 4096,
Whale, or other "stealth" infections when they are resident.

Incidently, re reboots: do remember seeing some original PCs exhibit
this behaviour when an undersized power supply warmed up. The 5v
supply dropped below what the unit could run on and they would reboot.
Just a possibility.

	 False alarm.  We have found that the 'virus' symptoms were in
fact due to a hardware problem.  The cable to the drive was only
partially plugged in.  The power and read signals reached the drive
ok, but the write signal was not making contact with the drive.

Just a minute... This is a popular rumor that has, as far as I know,
no basis in fact. The res. manager does _not_ get confused (about
that, anyway).

The problem with multiple System files is twofold:
1) On older systems, it wasn't to difficult to crosslaunch and wind up
with a different active system file than the one you booted with.
Like, one without the fonts and DAs you use all the time. Or possibly
even without resources that are needed by drivers or INITs (I'm less
certain of this- need to think about it...)
2) On newer systems (or rather, those which are running MultiFinder),
you can't crosslaunch. The problem is reduced to the possibility of
one of the other systems getting blessed accidentally, with annoying
results.

Some of the backup programs now available have timing abilities to
"remind" the user to do the backup (Mac: "I want to do a backup, quit
and feed me some disks.").  After setting up the program, all the user
has to do is feed the computer the floppies or turn on the tape drive.
These include FastBack II and Retrospect.

If they don't want to get new software, some macro making software
will wait for a specific time and then go through a sequence of
commands which could include backups.  I know AutoMac III will do
this.

Hi,

I have been asked by my project to gather information on anti-virus
products for PC-DOS and McIntosh machines. I have found an abundance
of them out there, but I need to hear from people who have actually
used any products - commercial or shareware.  So, if you currently use
any anti-virus products, I would appreciate it if you could relay me
the following information:
		-product function( i.e. virus detection, prevention)
		-ease of use, performance impact
		-effectiveness
		-approximate cost
		-recommended/not recommended
		-who makes it and where I can get it
		-any other comments

Thanks ! E-mail is fine. I will post a summary if anyone is interested.

Subject: Novell answer (PC)

I posted a message recently about an unusual problem that was
occurring on a Novell LAN, with apparent virus involvement and missing
files and directories. (V3, No. 177) Thanks for all the individual
replies and suggestions.

I had suggested initially that the problem was a perhaps a combination
of a common virus and a person problem, and made some specific
suggestions for each.

I talked with the person again, and he has implemented some of the
security suggestions.  The problem with missing directories and files
has not occurred since those steps were taken.

He reports that the Fu Manchu "keyboard" messages were present on a
workstation, indicating an operating copy, but it did not show up in
the files that were examined for infections after size changes.

At least at this point it appears likely that the mystery is solved,
and there are no new viruses with expanded capabilities on Novell
LANs.

Does this mean there are zero C64s?

I agree that viruses with immediate noticable side effects need a
large population of hosts to support them. However, viruses with very
long delays between infection and symptom can survive because they are
unnoticed.

For example, a virus which is intended to alter a few records of data
in a specific database and then hide itself might never be noticed,
and might spread through operating systems which are few and far
between over a long period of time (years).

The question was asked, "How safe are anonymous FTP sites from
viruses"?  I'd like to know the answer as well.  A user at our site
just retrieved some text files from the anonymous ftp server at
apple.com and found that her floppies began to be corrupted.  McAfee's
virus scan identified the Stoned virus in the partition table.  The
only known route of "infection" was the ftp connection.
     By the way, what is the usual process for removing a virus such
as this once found?  (I know, rank beginner question...we all start
somewhere).  Thanks.

[Ed. The only way (that I know of) to get infected by a virus via an
anonymous FTP site would be to download an infected executable file
and then execute it; I don't believe that this could have happened by
merely downloading a text file.  As such, a properly administered
anonymous FTP site is as safe as a properly administered bboard
system.  It is always a good idea (in my opinion) to use a virus
scanning product on any new software, shrinkwrap or public/shareware.]

I had the opposite problem on a Zenith 386SX, which, when optimized
with QEMM, would freeze.  It turns out that the Zenith has a "slush
ROM" that it writes to high RAM, and the area it writes to should not
be used for anything else.  Try excluding E000-E7FF from use in high
RAM.  That might solve the problem.

Parts of some .EXE-Files performing tape backup (it is Maynard

There are some programs which attempt to do this, but unfortunately it is
nearly impossible.

The reason is the existence of 'Stealth'-type viruses, where a program
appears unchanged after infection.

So, if you run a program infected with one of those viruses, all your
programs may be infected, without appearing to change in the
slightest.

The program will not catch the first infected program (assuming it is
new and not in the database), nor will it catch programs executed
later (as the virus is then in control)

Now ... I am not saying it is impossible, just that many current
programs have problems with this...

Subject: Stoned virus on 3.5" diskette (PC)

We've recently seen our first Stoned-infected 3.5" diskette.  This may
not be a new thing to everyone else, but it was to us!  Since the
Stoned only infects diskettes used in the A: drive, and since the
first infected diskette in the world was (presumably) a 5.25"
diskette, it took the virus awhile to get to 3.5" diskettes: one or
more rather unusual events was required for it to get across the line
(for instance, a machine with a 5.25" A: disk might have been booted
from an infected floppy, infecting the hard disk, and the A: drive was
then changed to a 3.5" drive, allowing the virus to spread from the
hard disk onto 3.5" media; there are probably other possible channels
I haven't thought of).

Since the Stoned has been one of the more common viruses recently, on
5.25" disks, it probably has the potential to spread widely in the
3.5" population as well.  So I thought I'd mention it...

outlook of the computing world, how fast are these things spreading,
are the "exterminators" winning the war?  I am doing a research
project on the spread of viri and would like some information (be it
generic or specific) on the early history to present.  I am also
looking for any suggestions on how these things are traced (as to come
up with an idea on how fast they multiply and spread).  Any help would
be *greatly* appreciated and would make my life a whole lot easier.
You may respond to me directly or post.  Thanks in advance.

Subject: Virus "WDEF A", help! (Mac)

My hard disk refuses to save files, though I can still access them
Desinfectant 2.0 seems to have spotted a virus called "WDEF A".  I'd
rather not re-initialize the (external) hard disk.  The contamination
is of Israelian origin most likely.  Could someone please tell me how
to proceed.

Many thanks,
Willem van der Wal, SURF124@KUB.NL.BITNET

Subject: SAM vs. Disinfectant (Mac)

There is currently disagreement among our macintosh users regarding
whether one should (for maximum protection) acquire SAM or
Disinfectant.  Up front I recognize that Disinfectant is free (in fact
I have version 2.3 on my Cx) and SAM is commercial.  Can anyone offer
me any stronger arguments one way or the other?  Since the Digest is
probably not the best place to argue the ralative merits of competing
packages direct email would probably be best.

thanks!

It sounds as if machine errors or crashes, at various times in the
past 18 months, had done some low-level damage to the disk directory
structures.  The errors became more and more severe as time went by,
due to the subsequent updating of the disk data structures.
Eventually, a high-level directory entry became corrupted, and the
files on the disk became inaccessible.

It's known that the WDEF virus is capable of causing crashes which
corrupt disk data structures... I've encountered disks which were
rendered entirely unmountable as a result of WDEF-induced crashes.  If
the Disinfectant INIT had only recently been installed on the SE/30,
it's possible that previous infections might have caused some damage
to the directories, and that only now has the damage propagated enough
to cause visible symptoms.

It's always a good idea to perform some preventing maintenance and
checking of your filesystems... run Disk First Aid periodically, run
the surface-test in the SCSI HD Setup, use Disk Doctor, etc.  If
problems show up, it's usually a good idea to back up the disk,
reinitialize, and restore the files.

Based on what you say about the lack of backups, I suspect that this
sort of routine check hasn't been performed on that machine.

Grumble.  You ought to bill them for your time, if your organizational
charter will permit doing so.

You should also let them know that you cannot guarantee complete
retrieval of their data, _or_ the correctness of any of it.  Recommend
that they manually inspect _every_ file that you restore, for
correctness from a financial point of view.

Put this in writing, with copies to your supervisor, to the head of the
department that owns the Mac, and to the head-of-department's superior.

You might also want to talk with your University's finance department,
and ask them what the requirements are for departmental financial
planners.  People who have financial authority are often required (by
audit requirements, and sometimes by law) to exercise due diligence in
maintaining the integrity of their data.  The failure of this department
to maintain backups could put them at risk of disciplinary action.
