The Independant Newspaper reported on 24'th. that a giveaway disk
distributed with the August issue of PC Today magazine was infected
with a virus called OGRE.  Suppliers and publisher were said to be
`concerned' and trying to recall the issue.  Sure enough I chanced to
find a copy today.  I warned the store.  Using scan reveals that the
giveaway is infected with killer virus, (a boot infector).

I find that the June issue gave away scan or something similar so the
publishers probably don't use their own freebies.

It is clear that a virus executed on a net connected workstation can
infect the workstation.

It is clear that a virus executed on a server can infect the both the
server and the attached workstations.

It is clear that a virus executed on a workstation with privileges to
write to programs on the server can infect those programs and thus other
workstations.

It is UNLIKELY that a virus executing on the workstation BUT without
privileges to write to the server can infect the server.

Jon David seems to suggest that this happened (otherwise why would this
be interesting).

It sounds as though he has evidence that files on the server were
infected.  It sounds as though netware was infected.  Since no one on a
workstation should have the privilege of writing to netware, this
suggests that the virus may have executed on the server.

What evidence is there that the server was infected by a virus executing
on a workstation and without the privilege to write to the server?

Viruses are succesful enough spreading under their own power from one
machine to another, thank you very much.  They do not need any help.

People who intend to ship tens of thousands of copies of the same floppy
have a SPECIAL OBLIGATION to ensure that they are clean.

The source code attack described by Vladis Kletnieks in V3 #130 was
the subject of a lecture and article by Ken Thompson.  It was titled
"Reflections on Trusting Trust," the 1983 Turing Award Lecture, and
was printed in the CACM in August 1984.  It was reprinted this year in
UNIX Review, but I forget which issue.  It should be required reading
for everyone on this list.  K.T. called it "the cutest program I ever
wrote."

It's interesting that it first appeared in 1983... seven years ago.

Subject: Re: Fooling checksums

I have certainly learned my lesson about leaving ambigious
messages...What I was responding to was an idea for a virus checker
which performs checksums, or other like tests to make sure it has
correctly identified a virus.  I was saying that a virus could fool
the virus tester into not being able to definitivly identify it
because it would change one (or more) of its non executing code, thus
"outsmarting" the virus checker.  However this would also make the
virus easier to detect because the crc of the file would change each
time you ran the program (or on a preset date...)  When people always
talk about an anti-virus program restoring the first few bytes of the
program in order to restore it, what if a virus also infects a random
(or predefined for that matter) part of the code by overwriting it
with killer code?

Yavuz,

In response to an occurrence of the Stoned virus in India and at
our headquarters here in Rhode Island, the following are procedures
which we directed our MIS personnel to use to remove the Stoned
virus.

The Stoned virus (or the New Zealand virus) resides in the
partition table (reference: The PC Virus Control Handbook, p. 48,
International Security Technology, Inc. p. 48).

If an infected floppy diskette is used to boot a machine, the virus
will copy itself into the partition table on the hard disk of the
computer, regardless of whether or not the floppy diskette is a
system diskette or not.

If a hard disk is infected with this virus, the partition table of
any DOS formatted diskette will be subsequently infected if it is
accessed after a normal hard drive boot.

The virus sits in the first physical sector on the hard disk and
the first physical sector on a floppy disk.  The text strings "Your
PC is now Stoned" and "LEGALISE MARIJUANA" will reside in the
partition table.  Use a utility such as NORTON UTILITIES, ADVANCED
EDITION, to search for the text strings in Side 0, Cylinder 0,
Sector 1 (in Absolute Sector mode) of the hard disk, or a floppy
disk.

On a floppy disk the first physical sector is also the first
logical sector, which is also occupied by the boot track.  The
partition table and the boot track on a floppy disk are effectively
the same thing.  On a hard disk, the first physical sector
(occupied by the partition table) and the first logical sector
(occupied by the boot track) are two very different sectors.

Because the virus resides in the first physical sector of a hard
disk, DOS FORMAT.COM will not destroy it.  FORMAT.COM works on the
logical drive, not the physical drive.

Furthermore, DOS FDISK.COM will not remove the virus in all cases.
I experienced one case where FDISK did overwrite the virus, but two
cases where it did not.

USE DISK MANAGER TO LOW-LEVEL FORMAT, RE-PARTITION, AND HIGH-LEVEL
FORMAT THE HARD DISK.  Low-level formatting the hard disk and re-
writing the partition table will remove the virus.  SPINRITE may
be equally effective, but I have not yet tested it.  (Note:  There
may be other equally effective utilities for a low-level format,
and for writing a new partition, but these are the tools which our
MIS personnel have.)

It is also possible to repartition the hard disk with DISK MANAGER,
overwriting the partition table and the virus with a new partition
table WITHOUT destroying the contents of the hard disk.  I have
done this only once, and I cannot say that this operation will work
in every case or will overwrite the virus in every case, but it is
certainly worth a try.  However, YOU MUST HAVE a current backup
available in case this fails AND YOU MUST BE ABLE to check
the partition table after the operation to make certain that the
repartitioning alone overwrites the virus.

Because the virus resides in the first logical sector on a floppy
disk, it is important that you not backup the hard disk with DOS.
A DOS backup disk will have a DOS format, meaning that the
partition table and boot track are created by DOS.  If this format
is created from a computer where the hard disk is infected with
this virus, the partition table and the boot track on the diskettes
will be infected.  Thus, if one of these diskettes is used to boot
a machine by accident, the partition table on the hard disk will
be reinfected.  It is unlikely that the partition table on the hard
disk will be reinfected by a restore operation alone, but DO NOT
TAKE THE CHANCE WITH DOS UNLESS IT IS THE ONLY BACKUP METHOD
AVAILABLE.

Making a backup with FASTBACK will not create infected diskettes,
because FASTBACK does not use a DOS format.  Thus, restoring a hard
disk backup, created with FASTBACK while the partition table was
infected, presents no danger of reinfecting the hard disk.

I hope that this has been helpful, and I also welcome comments from
others concerning procedures to remove the Stoned virus.

Subject: NetWare and Virus (PC)

Well, we seem to have a problem here.

The posting by Jon David suggests that the virus executes on the
workstation, has no WRITE privilege to the server, but infects
programs on the server.  By private email to me, Jon confirms that
that is what he intended to say.  He describes to me the test that he
conducted; it sounds convincing.  He asserts that Novell
representatives have seen the demonstration.

On the other hand, the posting to this list by Novell clearly states
that the the workstation must have rights to write and modify the
file.

It seems to me that someone is in error.

If David is correct, then, not only do we have a small virus problem,
but we have a very large NetWare security problem.

It would be interesting to know whether the virus simply writes to the
server, or whether it contains some overt mechanism to disable,
subvert, or otherwise bypass NetWare security.

Subject: Periodic infection reports on VALERT-L

After my posting about whether or not to post infection reports and
how much to report, I got a lot of feedback from quite a few people.
First of all, thanks to all those who took the time to write!

Based on the feedback, here's what I propose to do, bearing in mind
that all of this is subject to my time constraints (i.e., I don't have
the luxury of being able to devote a whole lot of time to this) - and
the approval of the readers:

In addition to the virus infection reports that we currently receive
on VALERT-L (which will continue, moderated on demand), I receive a
fair number of infection reports.  I will log these reports and
periodically (once a week or so, as demand dictates) put out a summary
of recent infections to VALERT-L.  The reports will contain the names
of the specific virus(es) and the geographic location of the
infections.  However, the postings will only contain reports that are
"new" - meaning, for example, new sightings of viruses in places where
they have not yet appeared.  The information that I receive will be
verified by telephone whenever possible (or noted that verification
was not possible) and will ONLY be reported by permission.

A number of people indicated that this sort of information would be
useful to system administrators to serve as a warning of infections in
their area, as well as to researchers who are doing statistical
analyses, etc.

As always, your comments and suggestions are welcomed.
