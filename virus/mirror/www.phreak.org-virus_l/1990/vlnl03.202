VIRUS-L is a moderated, digested mail forum for discussing computer
virus issues; comp.virus is a non-digested Usenet counterpart.
Discussions are not limited to any one hardware/software platform -
diversity is welcomed.  Contributions should be relevant, concise,
polite, etc.  Please sign submissions with your real name.  Send
contributions to VIRUS-L@IBM1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU (that's equivalent to
VIRUS-L at LEHIIBM1 for you BITNET folks).  Information on accessing
anti-virus, documentation, and back-issue archives is distributed
periodically on the list.  Administrative mail (comments, suggestions,
and so forth) should be sent to me at: krvw@CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU.

Subject: nVIR A infects Disinfectant? (Mac)

I had an nVIR A infection here, which disinfectant repaired
successfully, but after scanning the disk it reported that it
(Disinfectant 2.4) had gotten infected itself, and that I should
replace it from a backup.  How- ever, subsequent scans of Disinfectant
(self-scans, so to speak) reported no infection.  The virus was in a
copy of MacWrite on a students floppy disk... and as far as I know
nVIR A only spreads when an infected app- lication gets executed, no?
Also, I'm running Gatekeeper, which did not report any attacks...

Has anyone seen this behavior?  What should I make of it?

Subject: *NIX virus - again... (UNIX)

A couple of people have replied to my posting on UNIX and virus
infections.  Please re-read my posting.  I clearly stated that it all
belongs on PEOPLE.  A security-minded admnistrator CAN keep the risk
of an infection to minimum.  I never said the viruses were not
possible in a UNIX environment - they are, but the chances of anyone
logging into your system and wrecking havoc are small, considerably
smaller than in DOS.  To write a UNIX virus you need a very high level
of skill at picking the internals of UNIX, and that system IS harder
to master than DOS.  Granted, there is a number of ways of gaining the
root privs.  Most of them are well known, and the administrators who
care to CAN protect their systems.  Nothing is guaranteed to keep
nasties off, but with some very basic precautions you can contain any
infection.  UNIX comes with a number of defaults, like umask, etc,
that should really be changed.  No one but root can mess with my files
or directories, I and I should not be able to mess with anyone else's
file space.  If you keep people from writing to */bin directories,
they will not be able to mess with publicly used utilities.  Again,
the system is there, I think.  The people (and attitude) is not.  UNIX
is not "THE OS", but you can make it very safe.

Subject: nVIR (Mac)

     Hello, I stumbled across the nVIR B virus the other day when a
student brought me a disk with SuperPaint2.0 that claimed it was
infectant.  I ran Disinfectant on it and cleared it up, and read the
entry on nVIR in that excellent program's help section.  It described
nVIR A and B as being able to mate and form a new strain.  How does it
do this, and what are the propert- ies of the virus thus formed?  How
many variations are possible?  It seems to me that amount of variation
must be small if the virus is to remain effective, but I'd like to
hear from the experts.  Thanks in advance...

I don't know about the zero's, but the problem with bits sounds like
hardware.  We had a similar problem due to a flaky RAM chip in the
Ethernet card.  It only occurred when writing to the network, and
disappeared when the CPU clock speed was dropped 12MHz->6MHz.

Subject: Ogre Virus in utilities disk?? (PC)

Not long ago someone (from Queensland, I think) posted a message to
the effect that the demo disk distributed with PC-PLUS, a UK magazine,
contained the Ogre virus.

Could someone confirm this, please.  Is the Ogre a 'Mac' virus?  I
can't find it in VIRLIST.TXT, which comes with SCANV71.

I thought it was the October issue which was infected.  Is that right?
Should I be telling my local newsagent to send back the magazine?

     This is unlikely. Any decent BIOS will have a way to get into the CMOS
   config at cold boot time. The parameters can then be set well enough to
   boot from your recovery floppy and restore the CMOS you saved when you
   made the disk, right before you write protected it.

Some Suntac chip sets CAN be set by CMOS to such a state that the CPU
will hang even before it can start up the BIOS.  It has to do with
setting the memory wait states and refreshes.  If you manage to set it
up incorrectly, you WILL have to disconnect the battery and wait for
the CMOS to go dead.

However, there seems to be some confusion about "viruses in CMOS".
Facts are, on a PC/AT the CMOS is not in the processor address space
- -> no programs can reside in it.  Thus, all a virus can do is scramble
the CMOS contents.

Subject: Meeting of European virus experts

I just came back from the first meeting of virus-experts in Europe, which
was held in Hamburg.  A formal announcements regarding the results of the
meeting will probably be posted here later, but I just wanted to mention a
few items.

The number of known PC viruses is now almost 350 - and most of the recent
additions are from the Soviet Union and Bulgaria.  At the current rate, we
are seeing on the average more than two new viruses per week - making it
somewhat difficult just to keep up.  Some of the 50+ new viruses are highly
advanced - there is even one which infects .SYS files.

I will be busy the next two weeks working on those new viruses, but a new
version of F-PROT, capable of detecting and removing the viruses will be
made available around the end of the year.  The same of course applies to
other anti-virus programs - we all need to update our programs.

Subject: Stoned on widely distributed disk (PC)

WARNING: Stoned virus found on demo disk included "WHAT PERSONAL
COMPUTER" (United Kingdom) issue 18, Jan 1991.

The demo disk is called Mega-Disk, and contains a working demo version
of Domark's MIG-29 Fulcrum. I am not sure that the disk was actually
infected from the factory, but I suspect it since 2 machines on which
the disk was run were actually infected, and the disk was found to be
infected as well.

I would therefore suggest that any buyer of WHAT PERSONAL COMPUTER
magazine checks for viruses on the disk, even though the disk is
certified by the magazine as being VIRUS-FREE.

Ah - only if the virus is active when the program is LZEXEd - I am
assuming somebody might be using LZEXE on programs known to be
infected, in order to hide the virus.  That person would be careful
not to have the virus active at the time.

If the virus is active, you are correct - the stealth virus will be
eliminated.

Having read a few comments on the CCU, I'd like to add my 10p's worth
(this is the UK after all).

First, if the CCU does get a feed from this digest, how about advertising
the fact, so we know your reading one of the most appropriate sources of
information.

Second, how about letting us know what resources you have, as no doubt out
here in net land we can outstrip you by many orders of magnitude, which
I've no doubt many people would be more than willing to share a little
of to help fight a common enemy.

So if Noel Bonczonzek, or any of the other 3 officers in the CCU gets to
read this, then let us know.
